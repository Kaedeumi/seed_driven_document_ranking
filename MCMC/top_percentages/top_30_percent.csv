4831,0.017,17.0,"To better understand whether potent antiretroviral therapies can modify the natural history of HIV-1-associated microsporidiosis and cryptosporidiosis, the response to antimicrobial treatment of these opportunistic infections was evaluated in patients with or without antiretroviral treatment. Fifty patients with diarrhoea, all positive for Cryptosporidium parvum or Enterocytozoon bieneusi, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected concerning demographics, clinical and microbiological characteristics of the parasitic infection, antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Faecal samples were prepared using the Richie formalin-ethyl acetate method and stained using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method for detection of Cryptosporidium parvum and Isospora belli, the modified trichrome and calcofluor white technique for detection of Enterocytozoon spp., and iodine for detection of ova, cysts or vegetative forms. Diarrhoea was defined as an abnormal increase in stool liquidity, an abnormal increase in stool frequency and a daily stool weight of more than 250 g for a period of at least 4 days. Patients treated with double antiretroviral therapy or protease inhibitors demonstrated an excellent response and a sustained therapeutic effect after follow-up (range, 5-36 months). The relapse of cryptosporidiosis in two patients who discontinued antiretroviral therapy suggests that the infection might remain in a latent stage. The resolution of the diarrhoea seems to be related to an increased CD4+ cell count rather than to the viral load. In conclusion, these data strongly support the hypothesis that combination antiretroviral therapy is able to greatly modify the course of cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis in patients infected with HIV-1."
8267,0.016,16.0,"It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that efforts to optimize nutritional status through individualized medical nutrition therapy, assurance of food and nutrition security, and nutrition education are essential to the total system of health care available to people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection throughout the continuum of care. Broad-based efforts to improve health care access and treatment have stabilized HIV prevalence levels in many parts of the world and led to longer survival for people living with HIV infection. Confounding clinical and social issues, such as medication interactions, comorbidities, wasting, lipodystrophy, food insecurity, aging, and other related conditions further complicate disease management. With greater understanding of the mechanisms of HIV disease and its impact on body function, development of new treatments, and wider ranges of populations affected, the management of chronic HIV infection continues to become more complex and demanding. Achievement of food and nutrition security and management of nutrition-related complications of HIV infection remain significant challenges for clients with HIV infection and health care professionals. Registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, should integrate their efforts into the overall health care strategies to optimize their clinical and social influence for people living with HIV infection."
4048,0.015,15.0,"The government of Zimbabwe began providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in public institutions in 2004. In Midlands province two clinics constituted the most active HIV care service points, with patients being followed up through a comprehensive patient monitoring and tracking system which captured specific patient variables and outcomes over time. The data from 2006 to 2011 were subjected to analysis to answer specific research questions and this case study is based on that analysis. The goal of this case study is to build participants' capacity to undertake secondary data analysis and interpretation using a dataset for HIV antiretroviral therapy in Zimbabwe and to draw conclusions which inform recommendations. Case studies in applied epidemiology allow students to practice applying epidemiologic skills in the classroom to address real-world public health problems. Case studies as a vital component of an applied epidemiology curriculum are instrumental in reinforcing principles and skills covered in lectures or in background reading. The target audience includes Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programs (FELTPs), university students, district health executives, and health information officers."
6626,0.015,15.0,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of two-gene locus cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) +49 and CD86 +1057 were previously reported to influence the outcome of liver transplantation (LT) with respect to allograft acceptance. SNP at CTLA-4 +49 was also suggested to be associated with the individual difference in the clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, their influence on the incidence of post-LT HBV reinfection was not clear. With the increasing knowledge of costimulatory mechanisms on LT and host immune response, we designed this study to investigate the relationship between different alleles as well as genotypes at these two locations and HBV reinfection after LT."
1691,0.014,14.0,"Human immune deficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) infections remain major public health issues globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Impairment of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity by HIV and/or TB infections may limit the host's defences against other pathogens, including the diarrheagenic protozoan Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia intestinalis, and Entamoeba histolytica. During September-December 2015 a cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence and molecular diversity of these enteric parasites among HIV- and/or TB-infected patients at a medical reference centre in Chowke district, southern Mozambique. A total of 99 stool specimens were initially screened by direct microscopy and further confirmed and characterised by molecular methods. DNA sequence analyses of the genes encoding the small subunit ribosomal RNA and the 60-kDa glycoprotein were used for the typing and sub-typing of Cryptosporidium isolates, respectively. G. intestinalis-positive isolates by real-time PCR were subsequently typed at the glutamate dehydrogenase locus. Differential diagnosis of E. histolytica/dispar was achieved by real-time PCR. G. intestinalis (8.1%) was the enteric protozoan more frequently detected, followed by Cryptosporidium spp. (7.1%), and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (6.1%). Two HIV-infected (but not TB-infected) patients harbour G. intestinalis and Cryptosporidium spp. co-infections. Two (29%) G. intestinalis isolates were successfully characterised, revealing the presence of known AII and novel BIV genotypes. Four (57%) Cryptosporidium isolates were unmistakeable assigned to C. hominis, identifying two (IbA10G2 and IdA22) sub-types. Cryptosporidium infections were not associated to diarrhoea in HIV-positive patients, probably because improved immune function in the affected individuals due to antiretroviral therapy. G. intestinalis was considered a non-opportunistic pathogen, whereas the presence of E. histolytica could not be confirmed by molecular methods. Based on their common presence in the studied clinical population, we recommend the effective diagnosis and treatment of these enteropathogens for improving the management of HIV and TB patients."
5669,0.012,12.0,"The demand for dental treatment by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals is rising. Some professionals are still reluctant to treat these patients, despite the extremely low likelihood of professional transmission, which increases only in patients with a very elevated viral load. The complications rate after dental intervention is very low, even in patients with considerable immunologic deterioration. The dentist should pay special attention to the general clinical situation and immunologic and HIV virologic status of the seropositive patient, and to the presence of hemostasis alterations or of other concomitant diseases. Antiretroviral or any other drug treatments must also be recorded, in order to avoid possible interactions with clinician-prescribed drugs. Tooth extraction is the most common dental treatment and requires no antibiotic therapy except in cases of neutropenia or severe immunosuppression. Other dental treatments do not require special precautions, and the complications index among these patients is similar to that among the uninfected patient population. With this background, there is a need to make the clinician-in-training aware of the importance of regular dental health checkups as part of the health care routine of HIV-infected patients and to familiarize the clinician with their management, while not disregarding the unquestionable requirement to carry out the general and specific prevention measures to be adopted in all cases."
6369,0.012,12.0,"As of October 2006, 6 medications are approved in the United States for the management of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection: 2 formulations of interferon and 4 oral nucleos(t)ide analogues. For the treating practitioner, tailoring the pharmaceutical regimen according to patient features and clinical circumstances can be a challenge. First-line therapeutic regimens for the management of HBV infection include monotherapy with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved agent that has potent on-treatment viral response and low rates of resistance; in the future, these regimens may include a combination of more than one nucleos(t)ide analogue or a combination of a nucleos(t)ide analogue and pegylated interferon. The oral nucleos(t)ide analogues are generally better tolerated than interferon; however, they can be expensive when administered for lengthy periods and can also lead to medication resistance. Lamivudine, the first approved nucleoside analogue for the treatment of HBV infection, has a very high resistance profile; in fact, lamivudine exposure increases viral resistance to other commercially available nucleos(t)ide analogues: entecavir, telbivudine, and adefovir. For these reasons, the 2007 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines no longer recommend lamivudine as first-line therapy for the management of HBV infection. A satellite symposium conducted during the 57th Annual Meeting of the AASLD in Boston, Massachusetts, presented approaches to customizing the management of chronic HBV infection. The presentation highlighted recent findings suggesting that early, profound, and sustained viral suppression improves the probability of sustained virologic response and reduces the likelihood of nucleos(t)ide resistance."
6040,0.012,12.0,"Health care personnel are at high risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission. The aim of the present study was to investigate hepatitis B (HB) knowledge and vaccination acceptance among health care personnel in southwestern Greece, using the Hepatitis B Vaccine Knowledge and Acceptance Questionnaire. One hundred eighty-three employees participated (71 males). Occupation (p < .001), higher education (p < .001), and vaccination (p = .007) were significantly related to HB knowledge. The rate of HBV vaccination coverage was 70.9%. Participants considering themselves at high risk for HBV infection did not report significantly increased vaccination rates. In the multivariate analysis, university personnel (p = .002), occupational category (p < .001), and HB knowledge (p = .049) were significantly associated with vaccination. In conclusion, 29% of hospital personnel were not vaccinated mainly due to negligence. Occupation, education, and knowledge about HB seem to be associated with HBV vaccination."
1718,0.012,12.0,"Nonadherence to combination antiretroviral (ARV) therapies (cART) is highly prevalent and significantly increases the risk of adverse human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease outcomes. The current study evaluated the hypothesis that prospective memory-a dissociable aspect of episodic memory describing the ability to execute a future intention-plays an important role in successful cART adherence. Seventy-nine individuals with HIV infection who were prescribed at least one ARV medication underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological and neuromedical evaluation prior to completing a 1-month observation of their cART adherence as measured by electronic medication monitoring. Nonadherent individuals (n = 31) demonstrated significantly poorer prospective memory functioning as compared to adherent persons (n = 48), particularly on an index of time-based ProM (i.e., elevated loss of time errors). Deficits in time-based prospective memory were independently predictive of cART nonadherence, even after considering the possible influence of established predictors of adherence, such as general cognitive impairment (e.g., retrospective learning and memory) and psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression). These findings extend a nascent literature showing that impairment in time-based prospective memory significantly increases the risk of medication nonadherence and therefore may guide the development of novel strategies for intervention. (JINS, 2009, 15, 42-52.)."
8635,0.012,12.0,"Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common in resource-limited settings but is frequently not diagnosed. The authors retrospectively tested specimens for HBV in HIV-infected Thai women who had participated in an antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinical study. A substantial proportion (27 of 211; 13%) of HIV-infected women were HBV coinfected. Among HIV/HBV-coinfected women, the authors observed similar rates of antiretroviral-associated liver toxicity (despite nevirapine [NVP] use) and CD4 count reconstitution as observed in HIV-monoinfected women. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening detected the majority (81%) of HBV coinfections, including all 5 HBV-coinfected women who did not suppress HBV despite 48 weeks of lamivudine (3TC)-containing ART and could be used to tailor ART for patients diagnosed with HBV coinfection in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. Although HBsAg screening did not diagnose 5 occult HBV coinfections, these women achieved HBV suppression on 3TC-containing ART, suggesting that not detecting occult HBV coinfection would have limited clinical impact. "
8908,0.011,11.0,"Following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration into host cell DNA, the viral promoter can become transcriptionally silent in the absence of appropriate signals and factors. HIV-1 gene expression is dependent on regulatory elements contained within the long terminal repeat (LTR) that drive the synthesis of viral RNAs and proteins through interaction with multiple host and viral factors. Previous studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site I and Sp site III (3T, C-to-T change at position 3, and 5T, C-to-T change at position 5 of the binding site, respectively, when compared to the consensus B sequence) that are low affinity binding sites and correlate with more advanced stages of HIV-1 disease. Stably transfected cell lines containing the wild type, 3T, 5T, and 3T5T LTRs were developed utilizing bone marrow progenitor, T, and monocytic cell lines to explore the LTR phenotypes associated with these genotypic changes from an integrated chromatin-based microenvironment. Results suggest that in nonexpressing cell clones LTR-driven gene expression occurs in a SNP-specific manner in response to LTR activation or treatment with trichostatin A treatment, indicating a possible cell type and SNP-specific mechanism behind the epigenetic control of LTR activation. "
1165,0.01,10.0,"Physical function limitations have been associated with poor health outcomes, which have a negative impact on quality of life of older individuals. This study examined the association between depression, viral load, and acculturation with physical function among Latino men living with HIV. A secondary data analysis was performed using a cross-sectional data of 146 Latino immigrant men living with HIV in New York City and Washington, DC. Physical function was measured using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Uncontrolled HIV infection and depression were associated with worse physical function, thus implying the importance of adequate health care to address these conditions. Preserving physical function should start during middle adulthood, particularly among people living with HIV because of their greater risk of developing age-related challenges such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases among others. This study informs future interventions to preserve physical function and achieve the goal of successful aging."
3236,0.01,10.0,"The value of CD4 lymphocyte counts as a surrogate marker in persons with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection during antiretroviral treatment was assessed using longitudinal models and data from the Terry Beirn Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS didanosine/zalcitabine trial of 467 HIV-infected patients. Patients with AIDS or two CD4 counts of < or = 300 who fulfilled specific criteria for zidovudine intolerance or failure were randomized to receive either 500 mg didanosine (ddl) daily or 2.25 mg zalcitabine (ddC) per day. Absolute CD4 counts were recorded at study entry and at as many as four visits. Patients were followed for clinical disease progression and survival. At 2 months, the difference in mean CD4 count from baseline was +15.4 cells/mm3 in the ddI group but -1.3 cells/mm3 in the ddC group. Patients assigned to ddI had a greater chance of a CD4 response at 2 months than those on ddC, yet only those in the ddC group with a response showed significant improvement in progression of disease or survival compared with ddC nonresponders, ddI responders, and ddI nonresponders (p = 0.03). We conclude that a CD4 response does not necessarily correlate with improved outcome and is therefore not a useful surrogate marker in these patients."
4563,0.01,10.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection alters the epidemiology of mycobacterial infections. In the industrialised world, this has led to an increase in severe illness associated with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) and, in the developing world, to doubling of tuberculosis cases in some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The interaction with Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs when the CD4 count is relatively high (> 200) and tuberculosis (TB) is now the commonest presenting AIDS defining disease in Africa. In international public health terms the interaction between TB and HIV infection has led to the World Health Organisation declaring TB to be a global emergency. Both TB and HIV are diseases of poverty and the key to the reduction of incidence of both diseases is the improvement of socio-economic conditions. Other control methods are case finding and treatment, chemoprophylaxis and BCG vaccination. Finding active (sputum positive) case of tuberculosis and treating them is the function of TB control programmes in all countries, but poor adherence to medication has lead to low cure rates and increasing development of drug resistance. Resources are needed to improve adherence to medication and for research to improve diagnostic methods and treatment."
6042,0.01,10.0,"Increased concentrations of neopterin, a marker for cell-mediated immune activation, and decreased numbers of CD4+ T cells, are predictors for progression of disease after infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Previous studies have demonstrated different rates of onset of full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) for groups of patients, defined by laboratory marker values, who were initially symptom-free. By re-analysis of one such study, we demonstrate how for an individual patient, the individual marker values, together with a prior risk estimate, can be converted into current or accumulated post-test probability of onset of AIDS at a certain time. We used a statistical technique suggested by Albert et al. (Clin Chem 1984;30:69-76), which allows incorporation of fixed and time-dependent covariates. Besides allowing individual projections, the method shows that the predictive abilities of CD4+ T cell numbers and of neopterin concentrations do not vary greatly with regard to time of observation; both laboratory markers independently modulate the underlying prior probability of AIDS onset, which is significantly increased with the passage of time."
1795,0.01,10.0,"Wasting and food insecurity are commonly seen in patients receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, and supplementary feeding is often offered in conjunction with ART. Evidence for the effectiveness of such supplementary feeding is scant. A randomised, investigator-blinded, controlled clinical trial of two types of supplementary food, corn/soy blended flour and a ready-to-use peanut butter-based lipid paste, in wasted adults in Blantyre, Malawi is described and the results summarised. A historical control group who did not receive supplementary food is described as well. Provision of about half of the daily energy requirement as a supplementary food for 14 weeks resulted in more rapid restoration of a normal BMI; and the energy-dense, ready-to-use paste was associated with more rapid weight gain than the blended flour. Survival was similar among the 3 groups. The strong association between lower BMI and survival indirectly suggests that there may well be clinical benefit from supplementary feeding in this population. No differences were seen in ART adherence or quality of life with more rapid restoration of BMI. Further research is urgently needed concerning the widespread practice of supplementary feeding in HIV/AIDS care to most effectively utilize this intervention."
3596,0.01,10.0,"Multi-nucleos(t)ide resistance (MNR) mutations including Q151M, K65R mutations, and insertion at codon 69 of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase coding region may confer resistance to all molecules of nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). The presence of these mutations is an emerging problem compromising non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors-based therapies. Furthermore, factors associated with selection of these mutations are still not well defined. The current study aimed to evaluate the frequency and to characterize factors associated with the occurrence of multi-nucleos(t)ide resistance mutations among HIV-1 infected patients failing recommended first-line antiretroviral regimens in Cambodia."
8847,0.01,10.0,Recent studies have suggested that host genetics may be useful for predicting drug response and have supported the recommendation that single polynucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL28B should be investigated when treating hepatitis C virus (HCV)-1 infected patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether a single IL-28B genotype SNP rs8099917 or rs12979860 determination is sufficient to predict treatment failure in patients with chronic HCV.
4248,0.009,9.0,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) usually have an unfavorable clinical outcome in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients. In Egypt, data about epidemiology, the spectrum of disease, and impact of HDV on HBV infection are rare. To assess the prevalence, clinical and virological characteristics of HDV infection among Egyptian patients with chronic HBV. Adult patients with Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive were evaluated for the presence of HDV using anti HDV-IgG and HDV RNA by RT-PCR. Routine laboratory investigations, genotypes and subtypes for both HBV and HDV, abdominal sonography, and transient elastography (TE) were done. Liver biopsy was performed only in whenever indicated. One hundred and twenty-one treatment-naïve chronic HBV patients were included. Wild HBV genotype-D2 was found in 98.2% and 81.9% were HBeAg negative. Prevalence of HDV was 8.3% by anti-HDV IgG and 9.9% by RT-PCR. Wild HDV genotype-IIb was reported in 83.3%. HDV infection was more common in males, 90.9% of delta patients were HBeAg negative. Compared to the mono-infected HBV, concomitant HBV/HDV infection was not associated with more derangment in ALT nor advanced stage of fibrosis. 66.7% of HDV patients had significantly lower HBV-DNA level compared to the non-delta patients (P < 0.001). HDV is not uncommon in Egypt. HBV genotype-D was associated with HDV genotype-IIb. Delta infection was associated with negative HBeAg status, reduction of HBV replication, but neither influenced the clinical course nor increased significant liver damage risk."
5000,0.009,9.0,"Current data indicate that the risk for transmitting bloodborne pathogens in dental health care settings is low. Pre-exposure hepatitis B vaccination and the use of standard precautions to prevent exposure to blood are the most effective strategies for preventing DHCP from occupational infection with HIV, HBV or HCV. Each dental health care facility should develop a comprehensive written program for preventing and managing occupational exposures to blood that: (1) describes the types of blood exposures that may place DHCP at risk for infection; (2) outlines procedures for promptly reporting and evaluating such exposures; and (3) identifies a health care professional who is qualified to provide counseling and perform all medical evaluations and procedures in accordance with the most current USPHS recommendations. Finally, resources should be available that permit rapid access to clinical care, testing, counseling, and PEP for exposed DHCP and the testing and counseling of source patients."
2628,0.009,9.0,"In the era of antiretroviral therapy, HIV infection has become a chronic illness with associated multimorbidity, and practitioners are faced with an emerging population of HIV-infected patients with evolving needs for advance care planning (ACP), defined as communication between individuals and their proxies to plan for future health care decisions. This article provides a review of original research studies on ACP in HIV-infected adults in the era of antiretroviral therapy (1996-present) from PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Eleven studies conducted between 1996 and 2015 met the selection criteria, with study sizes ranging from 9 to 2864 participants. Most studies consisted of white men in outpatient settings and had poorly defined definitions of ACP. Prevalence of ACP was variable (36%-54% had end-of-life communication, 8%-47% had advance directives). Lack of ACP was most commonly associated with low income, followed by lower severity of illness, low education level, black or Hispanic race, female sex, younger age, injection drug use, and social isolation. Practitioners reported limited time or energy and inadequate preparation or training as barriers to ACP. Existing literature on ACP in the era of antiretroviral therapy is limited, but shows that ACP prevalence in HIV-infected individuals is variable depending on socioeconomic factors, severity of illness, and practitioner resources and training. More research is needed to increase ACP among HIV-infected individuals. "
4589,0.009,9.0,"After the identification of HIV-2 in 1986, most of the cases reported have been concentrated in West Africa. We identified a case of HIV-2 infection in São Paulo, Brazil of a 45-year-old female who presented with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, with a CD4 count of 22 cells/ml. DNA samples from this patient were subjected to end-point PCR amplification of the LTR region. Clones were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. All clones were subtype A related, and four presented an insertion, corresponding to an extra NF-kappaB site. This is the first confirmed case report of an HIV-2-infected subject identified in Brazil whose transmission occurred within the country. Furthermore, the NF-kappaB duplication would potentially be associated with an increase in viral cytopathogenicity. This raises concern for the need for permanent monitoring of the spread of HIV-2 in different areas of the world, even considering its lower rate of transmission and pathogenicity when compared to HIV-1."
8801,0.009,9.0,"The host genetic compound plays a vital role in determining clinical outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor family member-associated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activator (TANK) takes part in the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway and the interferon (IFN)-induction pathways that have relevance to HBV-related liver disease. In this report, we explored whether the intronic polymorphism rs3820998 of the TANK gene was associated with outcomes of HBV infection by binary logistic regression analysis. A total of 1305 unrelated Han Chinese patients recruited from Wuhan, including 180 acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACLF-HBV) patients, 331 HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, 308 HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, and 486 asymptomatic HBV carriers (AsC) were genotyped using the TaqMan probe method. Logistic analysis revealed that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3820998 was significantly associated with susceptibility to ACLF-HBV (dominant model, OR 0.643, 95% CI 0.428,0.964, p=0.033; additive model, OR 0.640, 95% CI 0.414,0.990, p=0.045), and LC (recessive model, OR 0.398, 95% CI 0.164,0.966, p=0.042; additive model, OR 0.379, 95% CI 0.155,0.928, p=0.034). These results indicate that the G > T variant is a protective factor in the development of ACLF-HBV and LC, and that the SNP rs3820998 in the TANK gene may play a role in mediating susceptibility to ACLF-HBV and LC in a Chinese Han population."
4759,0.009,9.0,"Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) and treatment engagement (TE) have been shown to significantly predict antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, but no studies have explored the ways and the extent to which similar outcomes might occur when these factors operate together, particularly for people who use drugs (PWUDs). We sought to discover whether TE moderated the effect of NCI on adherence to ART in HIV-infected individuals. One hundred sixteen HIV-infected, methadone-maintained people who reported HIV risk behaviors were enrolled in the study. Variables of interest (NCI, ART adherence, TE) were assessed using audio computer-assisted self-interview. Results revealed a significant interactive effect of NCI and TE on ART adherence, which supported the moderation effect. Findings from post hoc analyses showed that NCI was negatively associated with adherence to ART at low levels of TE. Findings suggest the need to accommodate individual NCI and improve TE as a means to enhance ART adherence in HIV-infected PWUDs."
3357,0.009,9.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with central nervous system (CNS) involvement causes a variety of psychiatric complications among a significant proportion of infected individuals. A cure for the fully developed AIDS related to HIV infection remains elusive, and HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death among adults between the ages of 25 and 44. Life expectancy, however, has gradually increased over the years, resulting in a concern for a potential increase in the incidence of secondary psychiatric manifestations. Knowledge of the neuropathology of HIV-CNS dysfunction and familiarity with its clinical presentation can aid clinicians in a determination of the appropriate therapy inclusive of psychiatric care that may be useful for a specific individual in their treatment."
4890,0.009,9.0,"There is limited information available about the prevalence and pattern of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance mutations (DRMs) among antiretroviral therapy (ART) experienced patients from northern India. Results of genotypic drug resistance testing were obtained from plasma samples of 128 patients, who had presented with clinical or immunological failure to treatment after at least six months of ART. Major DRMs associated with any of the three classes of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI), were seen in 120 out of 128 patients (93.8% prevalence). NRTI and NNRTI DRMs were each seen in 115/128 (89.8%) patients, with M184V, M41L, D67N and T215Y being the most frequent among NRTI associated mutations, and K103N, G190A, Y181C and A98G among NNRTI associated ones. PI DRMs were observed in 14/128 (10.9%) patients, with L10I, V82A and L89V being the commonest. These results present a high prevalence of DRMs among ART experienced patients from northern India with clinical or immunological failure of therapy. It emphasizes the need for regular testing of plasma samples of such patients for DRMs in order to detect and replace a failing regimen early, and also the use of HIV drug resistance genotyping of ART naive individuals prior to initiating first line ART for possible transmitted resistance. It is very important to enhance the access of patients to ARV drugs so that their compliance could be improved and hence development of DRMs be minimized."
8553,0.009,9.0,"Cohort studies of young (aged 18-30 years) injecting drug users recruited in 1997-1999 in the Harlem and Lower East Side areas of New York City, New York, were used to assess the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The authors found that HIV incidence was low at both sites: 0.8/100 person-years at the Harlem site and 0/100 person-years at the Lower East Side site. In contrast, HBV incidence was moderate (12.2/100 person-years) at the Harlem site and high (30.7/100 person-years) at the Lower East Side site. Similarly, HCV incidence was moderate (9.3/100 person-years) at the Harlem site and high (34.0/100 person-years) at the Lower East Side site. Results show that high rates of HBV and HCV transmission do not imply high rates of HIV transmission, even within an area of high HIV seroprevalence."
1912,0.009,9.0,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is characterized by the presence of HBV DNA in serum and/or in the liver of patients negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Occult infection may impact in several different clinical contexts including the risk of HBV transmission with transfusion or transplantation, and endogenous viral reactivation. The gold standard test for detection of occult infection is the amplification of HBV DNA. However, the serological assay for the long-lasting antibody response to the highly immunogenic HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) represents a qualified candidate as a surrogate for DNA amplification, or for increasing overall sensitivity when assessing the risk of occult hepatitis in peripheral blood. The risk of occult hepatitis associated with anti-HBc seropositivity has been demonstrated extensively, and the presence of antibody response to HBc can be considered a sentinel marker of occult HBV infection."
2780,0.009,9.0,"The number of HIV-positive people aged ≥50 years is rising each year. We measured the prevalence of non-infectious illnesses and their risk factors and described healthcare use in this UK population. A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at an outpatient HIV specialist clinic in south east England. Patients age ≥50 years were invited to complete questionnaires measuring demographics, non-infectious illnesses, medication use, lifestyle and healthcare utilisation. The response rate was 67%. Of 299 participants, 84% reported ≥1 comorbid condition and 61% reported ≥2 (multimorbidity). Most commonly reported were high cholesterol, sexual dysfunction, hypertension and depression. In multivariate analyses, age, number of years HIV-positive and duration of antiretroviral therapy remained significant predictors of comorbidity when controlling for lifestyle factors (exercise, smoking and use of recreational drugs and alcohol). Use of non-HIV healthcare services was associated with increasing comorbidity, a longer duration of HIV and recreational drug use. The majority of HIV-patients aged ≥50 years reported multiple comorbidities and this was associated with polypharmacy and increased use of non-HIV services. Further research examining the quality, safety and patient experience of healthcare is needed to inform development of services to optimally meet the needs of older HIV-positive patients."
3793,0.009,9.0,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are among the major public health challenges in Cameroon. This paper determined the effect of men's sex-related behaviors and HIV knowledge on reported STIs. The data came from the 2012 Cameroon's Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) that were collected from 7191 respondents in 2012. Descriptive and logistic regression methods were used for data analysis. Results showed that majority of the respondents were aware of STIs and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), while 3.96% reported STIs. Also, 49.45% of the men had no wife, while 75.58% and 84.58% noted that condoms and keeping of one partner could be used to prevent HIV transmission, respectively. Wrong impressions that mosquito bites and sharing of food could lead to HIV infection were held by 31.94% and 12.44% of the men, respectively. Among those that reported STIs, 33.33%, 30.18% and 13.33% respectively used condom during sex with most recent partner, second to most recent partner and third to most recent partner, compared to 24.69%, 15.04% and 4.17% among those that did not report STIs. Logistic regression results showed that probability of STI increased significantly (p < 0.05) with condom use with third most recent partners, being married, wrong knowledge that mosquito bites cause HIV and being away for more than one month, while it significantly reduced (p < 0.05) with number of children, knowledge that having one partner prevents STIs. It was concluded that policy initiatives and programmes to enhance right sexual knowledge and behavior among men would go a long way in reducing STI incidence in Cameroon."
2464,0.009,9.0,"Since 2001, antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living with HIV (PLHIV) has been available in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). A key factor in the effectiveness of ART is good adherence to the prescribed regimen for both individual well-being and public health. Poor adherence can contribute to the emergence of drug resistant strains of the virus and transmission during risky behaviors. Increased access to ART in low-income country settings has contributed to an interest in treatment adherence in resource-poor contexts. This study aims to investigate the proportion of adherence to ART and identify possible factors related to non-adherence to ART among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Lao PDR."

7643,0.009,9.0,"The objective of this study is to measure HIV/AIDS knowledge among patients with mental illness in Brazil and to examine individual and treatment setting predictors of knowledge. We conducted a cross-sectional national multicenter study among 2,475 patients in 26 randomly selected mental health institutions throughout Brazil. We used Item Response Theory to standardize knowledge scores and multilevel multiple linear regression to determine the effect of individual and treatment setting characteristics on standardized knowledge score. Schizophrenia was the main diagnosis (48%) of participants. Mean knowledge score was 6.78 (range 1-10). Treatment setting characteristics were not associated with knowledge scores. Higher HIV/AIDS knowledge scores were significantly associated with a history of sexually transmitted disease (STD), previous HIV testing and consistent condom use; lower HIV/AIDS knowledge scores were significantly associated with specific sociodemographic, psychiatric, and HIV risk-perception factors. Psychiatric patients in Brazil lag behind the general population with knowledge scores comparable to those of nearly a decade ago. The mental health system in Brazil and elsewhere must consider strategies beyond dispensing information, for preventing HIV/AIDS transmission in the psychiatric population."
5811,0.009,9.0,"HIV accelerates progression of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease. There are conflicting data on the effect of HCV on the risk of HIV progression and CD4 response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Long-term prospective cohort studies are clearly required to resolve these issues. The optimal management of the co-infected patient is also unclear. For the co-infected patient, the optimal HAART regimen for best immune CD4 recovery and least adverse reactions remains unclear. Unfortunately, current HCV treatment is associated with significant side effects and a considerable proportion of HIV co-infected patients are poor candidates for HCV treatment. Better and more effective treatment for HCV (preferably not based on interferon) is urgently required for this group of patients. Patients with good CD4 cell count and with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 are likely to have a reasonable response to treatment."
7080,0.009,9.0,"The prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia appears to be extremely high among female injection drug users in the inner city who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or hepatitis C (HCV) infections. Iron deficiency and its associated anemia may contribute to reduced energetic efficiency, lower aerobic capacity, decreased endurance, and fatigue. In practical terms, the functional limitations of iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia may affect the ability of women to participate in work, school, social, and family activities. Iron deficiency may contribute to the cycle of poverty in the inner city by limiting the ability of women to work, earn money, and afford iron-rich sources of food. Although iron supplementation may prevent or treat iron deficiency, the use of iron supplements needs to be approached with caution in women with HIV and HCV infections."
4794,0.008,8.0,"Treatment strategies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive active injecting drug users (IDUs) must take into account their lifestyles, that often result in low adherence to therapy. The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) offer simpler treatment regimens, but the appearance of drug resistance during treatment failure may cause high levels of cross-resistance to all NNRTIs. We adopted a combination therapy of two NRTIs and nevirapine (NVP) for treatment of IDU patients to evaluate its feasibility in such patients. From October 1998 to December 1999, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 80 IDUs on this regimen were collected. Fisher's exact test, Kaplan Meier method, and Cox model were used for statistical analysis. Overall, 20 IDUs discontinued the treatment because of side effects and 20 IDUs experienced treatment failure. Considering the treatment failure as an end point, 55.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 37.9%-72.6%) of patients was still undergoing treatment after 12 months compared to 44.6% (31.8%-58.6%) when discontinuation was also taken into account. An increasing trend over time was observed in the CD4+ lymphocyte count, among failing and nonfailing IDUs. By multivariate analysis, baseline HIV-RNA, treatment breaks and low adherence and active injecting drug use turned out to be significantly associated with treatment failure. Our results show that continuing injecting drug use and treatment breaks are the main factors that can lead to treatment failure in IDUs and easily to NNRTI class resistance."
4852,0.008,8.0,"To investigate the influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection on preexisting long-term chronic C hepatitis (HCV) 68 liver biopsies from 22 HIV/HCV-coinfected, 13 HIV- and 33 HCV-monoinfected patients and 71 livers obtained at autopsy from 26 HIV/HCV-coinfected and 45 HIV-monoinfected patients were studied by histo- and immunohistochemistry. All HIV patients had reached the advanced stage of immunodeficiency (stage III CDC), except for 3 haemophilias (stage II CDC). HCV infection was associated with a higher degree of portal, periportal and lobular inflammation-regardless of whether there was concurrent HIV infection. HIV/HCV coinfection was associated with a significantly higher rate of granulocytic cholangiolitis than HCV and HIV monoinfection (P < 0.05), a histological feature uncommon in C hepatitis. In HIV/HCV coinfection cholestasis was a predominant histological feature. HCV monoinfection and HCV/HIV coinfection were associated with the highest fibrosis index. In HIV/HCV coinfection centrilobular fibrosis was significantly more marked than in HCV monoinfection (P < 0.05), suggesting an HIV-associated fibrogenic effect. Patients with chronic C hepatitis showed a significantly increased rate of posthepatitic cirrhosis compared with the patients without HCV infection (P < 0.05). At autopsy, 10 of the 20 HIV/HCV-coinfected haemophiliacs had developed cirrhosis because of chronic C hepatitis, whereas cirrhosis was found in only 2 of 6 HIV/HCV-coinfected non-haemophiliacs (1 case of chronic B and C hepatitis, and 1 case of chronic alcohol abuse). No cirrhosis was observed in the 45 autopsy patients with HIV monoinfection. The findings suggest that HIV coinfection aggravates the course of preceding long-term chronic C hepatitis by a more marked (centrilobular) fibrosis. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients are threatened by a higher rate of posthepatitic cirrhosis-particularly in multitransfused haemophiliacs-and cholestatic hepatopathy."
2468,0.008,8.0,"The dental health of 94 HIV-positive patients was investigated by the sum of carious, missing and filling teeth (DMF index), plaque (Silness and Löe) and bleeding point indices (Lenox and Kopczyk). Blood parameters were evaluated, including total lymphocytes, CD4+ lymphocytes, beta-2-microglobulin, platelets, the Quick index, and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM and IgA). Patient oral parameters were contrasted with risk group (intravenous drug users homo- and heterosexuals) and controls. An evaluation was also made of differences in dental condition as a function of CD4+ cell number, according to the latest CDC classification (1992). HIV-positive intravenous drug users were found to present poorer DMF, plaque and bleeding point indices than the rest of the patients. No relationship was observed between CD4+ cell numbers in blood and dental condition, thus suggesting that the deteriorated dental health observed is a consequence of factors inherent to the risk groups involved rather than of the altered blood parameters."
9178,0.008,8.0,"This study aimed to determine the prevalence and species of Cryptosporidium among HIV/AIDS patients in southwest of Iran. Two hundred fifty faecal samples from HIV patients were examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts using a conventional coproscopic approach. Such oocysts were detected in 18 (7.2%) out of 250 faecal samples. Genomic DNAs from 250 samples were then subjected to a nested-PCR-RFLP technique targeting different loci of 18S rRNA gene for species identification. Out of 250 samples, 27 (10.8%) were positive for different Cryptosporidium spp; Restriction patterns resulting from the digestion of the nested amplicon with restriction endonucleases VspI and SspI showed that C. parvum (70.38%) was the most prevalent species, followed by C. hominis (25.92%) and C. meleagridis (3.7%), respectively. The mean CD4+ T-cell count was 215 cells/μL. There was a strong association between cryptosporidiosis and CD4+ T-cell count (P = 0.000) with the highest prevalence recorded among patients with CD4+ T-cell count < 200 cells/μL. This confirms that there is a low opportunity for this parasite to get established as the patients CD4+ T-cell count increases. Also HIV infection increased the risk of having Cryptosporidium. Our epidemiological findings are useful for any preventive intervention to control disease diffusion."
952,0.008,8.0,"Studies were conducted to determine if there is a mechanistic basis for reports of suboptimal virologic responses and concerns regarding the safety of regimens containing the combination of tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and didanosine (ddI) by assessing the pharmacokinetic consequences of coadministration of these drugs on intracellular nucleotides. This was a prospective and longitudinal study in HIV-1-infected patients of adding either TDF or ddI to a stable antiretroviral regimen containing the other drug. Intracellular concentrations of the nucleotide analogs TFV diphosphate (TFV-DP) and ddATP and the endogenous purine nucleotides dATP and 2'-dGTP in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured. A total of 16 patients were enrolled into the two study arms and a study extension. Intracellular TFV-DP concentrations (median, 120 fmol/10(6) cells) and ddATP concentrations (range, 1.50 to 7.54 fmol/10(6) cells in two patients) were unaffected following addition of ddI or TDF to a stable regimen containing the other drug. While coadministration of ddI and TDF for 4 weeks did not appear to impact dATP or dGTP concentrations, cross-sectional analysis suggested that extended therapy with ddI-containing regimens, irrespective of TDF coadministration, may decrease dATP and ddATP concentrations. Addition of TDF or ddI to a stable regimen including the other drug, in the context of ddI dose reduction, did not adversely affect the concentration of dATP, dGTP, TFV-DP, or ddATP. The association between longer-term ddI therapy and reduced intracellular nucleotide concentrations and this observation's implication for the efficacy and toxicity of ddI-containing regimens deserve further study."
5380,0.008,8.0,"Although zidovudine (ZDV) is effective in HIV-1-infected patients, the duration of its efficacy may be short when treatment is started in advanced HIV disease. This pilot prospective case-control study was designed to evaluate the combination of ZDV plus didanosine [ddI] compared with ZDV monotherapy as an initial therapeutic strategy. 'Control' patients (ZDV monotherapy) were matched with 'case' patients (ZDV plus ddI combination therapy) according to the presence or absence of AIDS-defining criteria at entry and CD4 cell count. The case patient group consisted of 35 consecutive HIV-1-infected individuals with < or = 300 CD4 cells/mm3, no previous experience of antiretroviral therapy and who accepted treatment with a combination of ZDV plus ddI. The control patient group consisted of 35 consecutive patients with similar characteristics, but who preferred to start treatment with ZDV alone. Control patients received 250 mg ZDV bid and case patients received ZDV at the same dose plus ddI (200 mg bid). Primary study endpoints were virological (serum HIV-1 RNA) and immunological (CD4 cell count) responses. Viral phenotype (syncytium-inducing (SI) or non-syncytium-inducing (NSI)), development of mutations at codons 215, 41 and 74 and clinical progression (new AIDS-defining event or death) were also assessed. Virological and CD4 cell count responses were significantly greater and more sustained in the group treated with ZDV plus ddI than in the control group, with peak responses of -1.2 +/- 0.7 log10 versus -0.3 +/- 0.4 log10 at 1 month (P = 0.0003) and 61 +/- 52 cells/mm3 versus 19 +/- 25 cells/mm3 at 2 months (P = 0.001), respectively. In both groups the percentage of patients developing a mutation at codon 215 was around 80 per cent at 12 months. A mutation at codon 74 was detected in 30 per cent of case patients at 12 months. Five case patients (14 per cent) versus 12 control patients (34 per cent) showed signs of clinical progression (P = 0.09). In a multivariate model, clinical progression was significantly associated with a baseline"
9923,0.008,8.0,"The recent expansion of antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage in middle/low-income countries has been associated with increasing prevalence of HIV pre-ART drug resistance (PDR). We assessed PDR prevalence, patterns, and trends in Guatemala. Blood samples from 1,084 ART-naive individuals, enrolled from October 2010 to December 2013 at the Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala City, were obtained. PDR was evaluated using the WHO mutation list for transmitted drug resistance (TDR) surveillance. An overall PDR prevalence of 7.3% (95% CI 5.8-9.0%) was observed for the whole study period. TDR to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) was the highest (4.9%, p<0.001), followed by nucleoside RT inhibitors (1.8%) and protease inhibitors (1.0%). No significant trends in PDR prevalence were observed during the study period. However, higher NNRTI PDR levels were found in individuals with >500 and 350-500 CD4(+) T cells/μl (7.4% and 8.7%, respectively) compared to individuals with <350 CD4(+) T cells/μl (3.7%; p=0.039 and p=0.007, respectively), as well as a tendency of higher levels of NNRTI transmitted drug resistance (DR) in individuals with recent infection determined by HIV incidence tests (9.7%), suggesting increasing trends in time. Clusters of viruses with NNRTI PDR suggesting complex transmission networks were observed. No associations between PDR and demographic variables were found. PDR in Guatemala remains at an intermediate level. Nevertheless, we have shown evidence suggesting increasing trends in NNRTI PDR, which need to be taken into account in national HIV management policies."

1843,0.008,8.0,"Effectiveness of antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention will require high adherence. Using qualitative data, this paper identifies potential lay social resources for support of PrEP adherence by HIV serodiscordant couples in Uganda, laying the groundwork for incorporation of these resources into adherence support initiatives as part of implementation. The qualitative analysis characterizes support for PrEP adherence provided by HIV-infected spouses, children, extended family members, and the larger community. Results suggest social resources for support of PrEP adherence in Africa are plentiful outside formal health care settings and health systems and that couples will readily use them. The same shortage of health professionals that impeded scale-up of antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS in Africa promises to challenge delivery of PrEP. Building on the treatment scale-up experience, implementers can address this challenge by examining the value of lay social resources for adherence support in developing strategies for delivery of PrEP."
7236,0.008,8.0,"Tetrahydro-imidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one and -thione (TIBO) derivatives were shown to specifically block human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication through a unique interaction with the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Through further modification of the lead compounds and structure-activity relationship analysis several new TIBO derivatives that show high potency, selectivity, and specificity against HIV-1 have been obtained. A new TIBO derivative, R86183, inhibits the replication of HIV-1, but not HIV-2, in a variety of CD4+ T-cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes, at a concentration of 0.3 to 30 nM, which is at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than the 50% cytotoxic concentration. Whereas an HIV-1 strain containing the Leu-100-->Ile mutation in the RT gene is about 400-fold less susceptible, R86183 still inhibits the replication of an HIV-1 strain containing the Tyr-181-->Cys RT mutation by 50% at a concentration of 130 nM. R86183 inhibits the poly(C).oligo(dG)12-18-directed HIV-1 RT reaction by 50% at a concentration of 57 nM. The antiviral activity of 22 TIBO derivatives in cell culture correlated well with their activity against HIV-1 RT. No such correlation was found for their cytotoxicity. The combination of R86183 with either zidovudine or didanosine resulted in a synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 (strain IIIB) replication. Combination of R86183 with the protease inhibitor Ro31-8959 was found to be additive. Also described is a dilution protocol circumventing overestimation and underestimation of antiviral activity due to adherence to plastic surfaces."
3726,0.008,8.0,"Hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV-DNA) was studied by Southern blot analysis in liver biopsy specimens from 75 HBsAg-positive patients with chronic liver disease living in southern Italy. Twenty-seven of the patients were hepatitis delta virus (HDV) superinfected. Intrahepatic HBV-DNA was detected in 54 (72%) patients, 32 (59%) of them with replicative forms. The presence of replicative forms was directly related to liver HBcAg and inversely related to liver HDAg, as shown by multivariate analysis. However, 14 patients with intrahepatic HBV-DNA non-replicative pattern and about half of HDV-infected patients were liver HBcAg and/or serum HBV-DNA positive, mostly in low amounts. Histological inflammatory activity was strongly related to liver HBcAg expression regardless of HDV superinfection, as confirmed by multivariate analysis. Our results confirm previous studies about the concordance between intrahepatic HBV-DNA replicative pattern and liver HBcAg expression and about inhibition by HDV of high-level HBV replication. However, they suggest that low-level HBV replication may have an important role in causing liver damage also among HDV-infected patients, in a population where the spreading of HBV and HDV is a naturally occurring event."
6581,0.008,8.0,"Vitamin D regulates bone metabolism but has also immunoregulatory properties. In HIV-infected patients bone disorders are increasingly observed. Furthermore, low 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) levels have been associated with low CD4(+) counts, immunological hyperactivity, and AIDS progression rates. Few studies have examined the vitamin D status in HIV-infected patients. This study will specifically focus on the effects of antiretroviral agents on vitamin D status. Furthermore, the effect of vitamin D status on CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART will be evaluated. Among 252 included patients the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<35 nmol/liter from April to September and <25 nmol/liter from October to March) was 29%. Female sex, younger age, dark skin, and NNRTI treatment were significant risk factors in univariate analysis, although in multivariate analyses skin pigmentation remained the only independent risk factor. Median 25(OH)D(3) levels were significantly lower in white NNRTI-treated patients [54.5(27.9-73.8) nmol/liter] compared to white PI-treated patients [77.3 (46.6-100.0) nmol/liter, p = 0.007], while among nonwhites no difference was observed. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients had significantly higher blood PTH levels than patients without treatment. Moreover, NNRTI treatment puts patients at risk of elevated PTH levels (>6.5 pmol/liter). Linear regression analysis showed that vitamin D status did not affect CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART. In conclusion, 29% of the HIV-1-infected patients had vitamin D deficiency, with skin color as an independent risk factor. NNRTI treatment may add more risk for vitamin D deficiency. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients showed higher PTH levels and might therefore be at risk of bone problems. Evaluation of 25(OH)D(3) and PTH levels, especially in NNRTI-treated and dark skinned HIV-1-infected patients, is necessary to detect and treat vitamin D deficiency early."
9090,0.008,8.0,"A synthetic peptide, RPI 312, that specifically inhibits the protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) showed a potent inhibition on virus production, maturation, and infectivity. Treatment with this agent prevented the cleavage of Gag protein at the site between p17 and p24 in HIV-1 chronically infected MOLT-4 cells as well as in the released virus. Passage of HIV-1 in the presence of gradually increasing concentrations of this protease inhibitor resulted in emergence of a variant that could evade the drug effects. In the resistant variant the maturation of Gag proteins appeared normal, but its infectivity was reduced compared with that of the parent virus. The nucleotides coding the amino acids at and around the cleavage site between Gag proteins p17 and p24 were not changed. One point mutation (A-->G) at site 2082 of the pol gene that resulted in one amino acid change at site 84 of the protease from isoleucine to valine (I-84-->V) could be detected in the resistant variant. An HIV-1 infectious DNA clone with the I-84-->V mutation also showed reduced sensitivity to this protease inhibitor. The findings that the resistant variant had lower infectivity and was still affected by higher doses of the drug support the speculation that resistance to protease inhibitors may not be as problematic as other drug resistance."

Overall, 69% reported having been vaccinated for HAV and 70% reported having been vaccinated for HBV. Multivariate models were used to identify predictors of HAV and HBV vaccination, and younger men, HIV-positive men, and men who had access to a doctor or clinic were more likely to be vaccinated than older men, HIV-negative men, and men without access to a doctor or clinic. Men with health insurance coverage were more likely to have received HBV vaccination than men without coverage. Findings indicate that there is still a significant proportion of unvaccinated men in our sample."
1150,0.008,8.0,"Substantial changes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related sexual behavior have been reported by virtually every survey of homosexual/bisexual men in the last decade. This paper uses a behavior-based simulation to examine how such changes are likely to affect the long-term future of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic among homosexual men. Data from the Longitudinal AIDS Impact Project in New York City are used to estimate age-specific patterns of unprotected anogenital contact and behavioral change from 1980 to 1991. Model projections are validated using New York City surveillance data on AIDS incidence from 1981 to 1991. The current levels of unsafe sex reported in the Longitudinal AIDS Impact Project are shown to be almost exactly on the epidemic threshold. If this behavior were maintained, HIV prevalence would slowly decline in the population, but with just one additional unsafe sexual partner per year HIV would instead become endemic, with seroprevalence of about 65% in the oldest group and about 25% in the youngest. Transmission dynamics in the youngest group are analyzed in detail. For this group, the assortative age-matching bias in partner selection patterns raises the unsafe behavior threshold slightly in the long run."
4892,0.008,8.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an occupational risk of surgeons especially in developing countries where asymptomatic carrier rate is about 15%. Despite better knowledge about mode of transmission and methods of prevention including use of active immunization, it still remains a threat. In this study, a questionnaire survey of Nigerian surgeons was conducted to ascertain their knowledge, and immunization status against HBV infection. Our study showed a 9.3% incidence of clinical HBV infection, poor perception of risk of infection, poor local availability of vaccines, and low uptake where same was available. Reasons cited for non-immunization are lack of awareness, cost, inertia and non-availability of vaccines. Only 10.2% of our respondents always used barrier methods, and 77.7% of our respondents do not check the immune status of their patients after sustaining an intraoperative sharp injury. The overall level of knowledge about HBV infection was deemed poor. We conclude with recommendations on how to improve knowledge about HBV infection and uptake of vaccines."
4355,0.008,8.0,"We studied barriers to HIV care among HIV-positive Latinos in the US-Mexico border region, where HIV prevalence is increasing. HIV-positive participants receiving HIV care were recruited from clinics in Southern California and underwent structured interviews (n = 157). Logistic regression explored covariates associated with > or =1 barrier to HIV care. HIV-positive patients were mostly male (84.7%), of Mexican-origin (82.8%), and had a mean age of 37.3 years. Among males (n = 133), 67% identified as men who have sex with men. In the prior year, patients received the following care in Mexico: HIV care (33.1%), non-HIV care (43.3%), prescription medications (51.6%), and traditional medications/herbs (17.2%). The most common barriers to HIV care included stigma and medication side effects concerns. Factors independently associated with > or =1 barrier to HIV care were HIV diagnosis >1 year ago; being of Mexican-origin; crossing the US-Mexico border <5 times in the past year; obtaining medications in Mexico; and age. Findings illustrate that bi-national health care utilization is common, which has implications for HIV service delivery in both countries. Additional studies are needed to better understand individual, provider and system level barriers to HIV care in the San Diego/Tijuana border region."
8861,0.008,8.0,"In 1994, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) recommended the use of zidovudine (ZDV) to reduce perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission; in 1995, USPHS recommended universal prenatal HIV counseling and voluntary testing. Widespread implementation of these recommendations, together with increased use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and scheduled cesarean delivery, has resulted in substantial declines in perinatal HIV transmission. However, perinatal HIV transmission continues to occur. To identify missed prevention opportunities, CDC analyzed the incidence of perinatal HIV infection among a cohort of HIV-exposed infants born during 1997-2000 at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta, Georgia. This report describes the results of that analysis and underscores the challenges to universal prevention of infant HIV infections. Efforts to reduce perinatal HIV transmission should focus on increasing prenatal care rates, promoting adherence to recommended treatment regimens during pregnancy, and increasing prenatal HIV testing, particularly in areas where missed opportunities for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission persist."
6426,0.008,8.0,"Europe is currently observing a significant rise in non-B subtypes. Consequently, the effect of genetic variability on therapy response or genotypic resistance interpretation algorithms is an emerging concern. The purpose of this study is to investigate the amino acid substitutions selected under drug pressure in the protease of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes B and G, and determine if there are any significant differences. We investigated therapy-related and subtype-related substitutions in the protease, considering subtype, overall protease inhibitor treatment and individual drug exposure. Many mutations were significantly related to protease inhibitor (PI) therapy, with mutations exclusive to subtype B or subtype G. Some mutations are at positions related to resistance in both subtypes, but the amino acid substitution is different. Other mutations were significantly associated with subtype and PI selective pressure (p<0.05), pointing towards a differential selective pressure in both subtypes. We confirmed previous reports on the subtype-dependent selection of D30N and 89I, and identified a new mutation with such differential selective pressure: 37D was preferentially selected by lopinavir in subtype B. Other novel mutations found under therapy pressure were 13A, 35N, K55R, I66F, I72L/T, T74S, 82M and 89I/V. Our study indicates that even though in general, drug selective pressure and resistance pathways are relatively similar between subtypes B and G, some differences do occur, leading to subtype-dependent substitutions."
1820,0.008,8.0,"One key step of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the integration of its viral cDNA. This process is mediated through complex networks of host-virus interactions that alter several normal cell functions of the host. To study the complexity of disturbances in cell gene expression networks by HIV-1 integration, we constructed a network of human macrophage genes located close to chromatin regions rich in proviruses. To perform the network analysis, we selected 28 genes previously identified as the target of cDNA integration and their transcriptional profiles were obtained from GEO Profiles (NCBI). A total of 2770 interactions among the 28 genes located around the HIV-1 proviruses in human macrophages formed a highly dense main network connected to five sub-networks. The overall network was significantly enriched by genes associated with signal transduction, cellular communication and regulatory processes. To simulate the effects of HIV-1 integration in infected macrophages, five genes with the most number of interaction in the normal network were turned off by putting in zero the correspondent expression values. The HIV-1 infected network showed changes in its topology and alteration in the macrophage functions reflected in a re-programming of biosynthetic and general metabolic process. Understanding the complex virus-host interactions that occur during HIV-1 integration, may provided valuable genomic information to develop new antiviral treatments focusing on the management of some specific gene expression networks associated with viral integration. This is the first gene network which describes the human macrophages genes interactions related with HIV-1 integration."
4899,0.008,8.0,"To investigate the process of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution in vivo, a total of 179 HIV-1 V3 sequences derived from cell-free plasma were determined from serial samples in three epidemiologically linked individuals (one infected blood donor and two transfusion recipients) over a maximum period of 8 years. A systematic analysis of pairwise comparisons of intrapatient sequences, both within and between each sample time point, revealed a preponderance and accumulation of nonsynonymous rather than synonymous substitutions in the V3 loop and flanking regions as they diverged over time. This strongly argues for the dominant role that positive selection for amino acid change plays in governing the pattern and process of HIV-1 env V3 evolution in vivo and nullifies hypotheses of purely neutral or mutation-driven evolution or completely chance events. In addition, different rates of evolution of HIV-1 were observed in these three different individuals infected with the same viral strain, suggesting that the degree of positive pressure for HIV-1 amino acid change is host dependent. Finally, the observed similar rate of accumulation in divergence within and between infected individuals suggests that the process of genetic divergence in the HIV epidemic proceeds regardless of host-to-host transmission events, i.e., that transmission does not reset the evolutionary clock."
4051,0.008,8.0,"The determination of the prevalence of primary resistance to antiretroviral therapy in different places of the world is of extreme importance in molecular epidemiology monitoring, and it can guide the initial patient therapy in a given geographical area. The frequency of drug resistance mutations (DRM) and the genetic variability of HIV-1 isolates from newly diagnosed HIV-infected pregnant women attending the antenatal clinics of the Lucrecia Paim and Augusto N'Gangula maternities, Luanda-Angola, were determined. Thirty five out of 57 samples (61.4%) were sequenced and one mutation associated with resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was detected. Additionally, two mutations associated with resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were also detected. No primary mutations associated with protease inhibitors (PI) were found. Subtypes A1, C, D, F1, G, H, CRF 13, CRF 37, and other mosaics were detected."
1303,0.008,8.0,"Health literacy is known to influence medication adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS. People who experience difficulty reading health information may benefit from asking others to assist them with reading, interpreting, and understanding medical information. We examined medical chart-abstracted HIV viral load, medication adherence assessed by unannounced pill counts, and adherence improvement strategies among 245 individuals with lower-health literacy who do not request assistance, and 229 who do request assistance with reading and understanding health information. Participants were people living with HIV who were taking antiretroviral therapy and scored below 90% correct on a standardized test of functional health literacy. After controlling for health literacy scores, requesting informational assistance was associated with strategies used to improve adherence; individuals who asked for assistance were significantly more likely to use multiple adherence strategies. However, despite requesting informational assistance and using more adherence strategies, participants who requested informational assistance evidenced poorer treatment adherence and poorer suppression of HIV replication. Requesting assistance was more common among those with the poorest health literacy and therefore greatest challenges to adherence. People living with HIV who have poor health literacy skills may benefit from medication adherence programs and requests for assistance afford opportunities for social interventions."
6893,0.008,8.0,"Lamivudine is a major drug approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Emergence of drug-resistant mutants with amino acid substitutions in the YMDD motif is a well-documented problem during long-term lamivudine therapy. Here we report a novel lamivudine-resistant strain of HBV with an intact YMDD motif, which included an amino acid substitution, rtA181T, in the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of HBV polymerase. The substitution also induced a unique amino acid substitution (W172L) in the overlapping hepatitis B surface (HBs) protein. The YMDD mutant strains were not detected even by using the sensitive peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR clamping method. The detected nucleotide substitution was accompanied by the emergence of an additional nucleotide substitution that induced amino acid change (S331C) in the spacer domain. The rtA181T mutant strain displayed a threefold decrease in susceptibility to lamivudine in in vitro experiments in comparison with the wild type. In vivo analysis using human hepatocyte-chimeric mice confirmed the resistance of this mutant strain to lamivudine. We developed a method to detect this novel rtA181T mutation and a previously reported rtA181T mutation with the HBs stop codon using restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR and identified one patient with the latter pattern among 40 patients with lamivudine resistance. In conclusion, although the incidence is not high, we have to be careful regarding the emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutant strains with intact YMDD motif."
4371,0.008,8.0,"Different effective treatments, which are today available for chronic virus hepatitis C and B, reduce the rate of adverse outcomes but HCV and HBV infections are still one of the major health and public medical problems. Screening for HCV and HBV is performed only in high-risk groups with diagnostic tests with high sensitivity and specificity. In HCV antibody positive patients, serum HCV RNA has to be determined by quantitative assay and virus genotype identified. Liver fibrosis is determined by liver biopsy or widely accepted elastography and different serum fibrosis markers. In patients with HCV cirrhosis, HCC has to be detected by expert ultrasound performer or MSCT, MR, and liver transplantation performed according to indications. The current hepatitis B vaccination policy is universal neonatal vaccination. The risk population undergo screening for HBsAg, antiHBc and antiHBs antibodies. The HBsAg, HBeAg and antiHBe positive individuals undergo quantitative testing for HBsAg and HBV DNA. According to the stage of their liver disease, patients are treated with interferon or nucleos(t)ide analogues. The optimal treatment with oral antivirals are entecavir and tenofovir, but the duration of treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues is generally life-long. In HBV cirrhosis and HBsAg inactive carriers, detection of HCC is essential, and liver transplantation is successfully performed in these patients."
3108,0.008,8.0,"The study investigated the impact of xerostomia on oral health and quality of life (QoL) among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who were attending for routine HIV monitoring in Australia. This cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire survey and oral screening (OS) included 100 subjects who were HIV positive. The OS was conducted by a dentist blinded to the subject's survey responses. Xerostomia was determined by asking the subjects a single question. Subjects with xerostomia were found to have increased caries activity and poorer QoL, especially in the psychological dimensions of the oral health impact profile. Age and duration of HIV infection were associated with xerostomia. Early diagnosis of xerostomia and intervention with preventive dental care would potentially reduce caries and improve QoL among patients infected with HIV-1. Ongoing chronic inflammation of salivary glands despite the beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapy may play a role in the etiology of xerostomia in patients infected with HIV and requires further study."
2873,0.007,7.0,"The HAART therapy has improved life expectancy enabling long latency conditions caused by the hepatitis viruses that became the leading cause of death in HIV infected patients. In this study a group of 300 patients aged from 18 to 63 years were selected in order to assess the prevalence and consequences of HIV and the hepatitis B (HBV), C (HCV) and D (HDV) viruses coinfections. Study groups were designed for each coinfection. These groups were in turn divided in case groups formed of coinfected participants and control groups consisting of mono-infected participants. This classification was obtained by testing the participants for the presence of specific infection markers using the ELISA technique. As a result, in regard to the HIV/HBV coinfection the study group consisted of 16 coinfected participants and 114 HBV-infected participants resulting in a prevalence of the coinfection of 14%. In the case of the HIV/HDV coinfection the study group consisted of 5 coinfected participants and 45 HDV-infected participants. The prevalence of the HIV/HCV coinfection was 25% out of the 170 HCV-infected participants. The effect of the coinfections on the expression and levels of the infection markers was analyzed in constrast to those encountered in the case of the mono-infection. The observed changes in the expression of the specific hepatitis markers indicate the impact of the coinfection with HIV on the progression of the hepatitis infections. In addition, the inadequate immune response towards the hepatitis viruses in the case of the coinfected participants leads to the development of cirrhosis and end stage liver disease."
1434,0.007,7.0,"Patients with resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection undergoing chemo- or immunosuppressive therapy are at potential risk for HBV reactivation. To determine whether the host immune response contributes to liver injury, we performed an immunological analysis of a patient with HBV reactivation. Consistent with the detection of HBV DNA in the sera, the number of polyclonal HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) gradually increased; however, the number of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) decreased. The interaction between HBV-specific CTLs and CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg is an important determinant of liver injury during HBV reactivation. Therefore, monitoring the number of these cells might be a useful modality for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis resulting from HBV reactivation. "
6886,0.007,7.0,"Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) represents a valuable tool for genomic engineering due to its single-nucleotide precision, high nuclease activity, and low cytotoxicity. We report here systematic design and characterization of 28 novel TALENs targeting multiple regions of CCR5 gene (CCR5-TALEN) which encodes the co-receptor critical for entry of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1). By systemic characterization of these CCR5-TALENs, we have identified one (CCR5-TALEN-515) with higher nuclease activity, specificity, and lower cytotoxicity compared with zinc-finger nuclease (CCR5-ZFN) currently undergoing clinical trials. Sequence analysis of target cell line GHOST-CCR5-CXCR4 and human primary CD4 T cells showed that the double-strand breaks at the TALEN targeted sites resulted in truncated or nonfunctional CCR5 proteins thereby conferring protection against HIV-1 infection in vitro. None of the CCR5-TALENs had detectable levels of off-target nuclease activity against the homologous region in CCR2 although substantial level was identified for CCR5-ZFN in the primary CD4 T cells. Our results suggest that the CCR5-TALENs identified here are highly functional nucleases that produce protective genetic alterations to human CCR5. Application of these TALENs directly to the primary CD4 T cells and CD34 hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of infected individuals could help to create an immune system resistant to HIV-1 infection, recapitulating the success of ""Berlin patient"" and serving as an essential first step towards a ""functional"" cure of AIDS."
1917,0.007,7.0,"HIV-seropositive, active injection-drug users (IDUs), compared with other HIV populations, continue to have low rates of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use, contributing to disparities in their HIV health outcomes. We sought to identify individual-level, interpersonal, and structural factors associated with HAART use among active IDUs to inform comprehensive, contextually tailored intervention to improve the HAART use of IDUs. Prospective data from three semiannual assessments were combined, and logistic general estimating equations were used to identify variables associated with taking HAART 6 months later. Participants were a community sample of HIV-seropositive, active IDUs enrolled in the INSPIRE study, a U.S. multisite (Baltimore, Miami, New York, San Francisco) prevention intervention. The analytic sample included 1,225 observations, and comprised 62% males, 75% active drug users, 75% non-Hispanic blacks, and 55% with a CD4 count <350; 48% reported HAART use. Adjusted analyses indicated that the later HAART use of IDUs was independently predicted by patient-provider engagement, stable housing, medical coverage, and more HIV primary care visits. Significant individual factors included not currently using drugs and a positive attitude about HAART benefits even if using illicit drugs. Those who reported patient-centered interactions with their HIV primary care provider had a 45% greater odds of later HAART use, and those with stable housing had twofold greater odds. These findings suggest that interventions to improve the HIV treatment of IDUs and to reduce their HIV health disparities should be comprehensive, promoting better patient-provider engagement, stable housing, HAART education with regard to illicit drug use, and integration of drug-abuse treatment with HIV primary care."
5112,0.007,7.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly endemic in the Solomon Islands. However, little is known about the status of occult HBV infection in the Solomon Islands. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of occult HBV infection and its clinical and virological features in the community of Solomon Islands. Blood samples were collected from a total of 564 asymptomatic individuals aged over 18 years in the Western province. The samples used in the present study consisted of 200 samples from 108 males and 92 females (mean age, 37.4 years; range, 18-71 years) that were randomly selected among the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative samples from all the participants enrolled in this study. HBV-DNA was detected by real-time PCR in 25 (12.5%) of the 200 HBsAg-negative samples. Most of the HBV-DNA-positive individuals were infected with wild-type HBV, and only 3 strains demonstrated specific amino acid substitutions (P121X, T123N, C138S, P142S and D144E) in the α determinant region. In conclusion, occult HBV infection was documented in 12.5% of individuals that demonstrated serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection in this study. The prevalence of occult infection was also influenced by ethnicity; it was more prevalent in Melanesians than Micronesians. In addition, occult HBV infection demonstrated a weak association with the S-variants."
6020,0.007,7.0,"Scaling up access to HIV viral load testing for individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy in low-resource settings is a global health priority, as emphasised by research showing the benefits of suppressed viral load for the individual and the whole population. Historically, large-scale diagnostic test implementation has been slow and incomplete because of service delivery and other challenges. Building on lessons from the past, in this Personal View we propose a new framework to accelerate viral load scale-up and ensure equitable access to this essential test. The framework includes the following steps: (1) ensuring adequate financial investment in scaling up this test; (2) achieving pricing agreements and consolidating procurement to lower prices of the test; (3) strengthening functional tiered laboratory networks and systems to expand access to reliable, high-quality testing across countries; (4) strengthening national leadership, with prioritisation of laboratory services; and (5) demand creation and uptake of test results by clinicians, nurses, and patients, which will be vital in ensuring viral load tests are appropriately used to improve the quality of care. The use of dried blood spots to stabilise and ship samples from clinics to laboratories, and the use of point-of-care diagnostic tests, will also be important for ensuring access, especially in settings with reduced laboratory capacity. For countries that have just started to scale up viral load testing, lessons can be learnt from countries such as Botswana, Brazil, South Africa, and Thailand, which have already established viral load programmes. This framework might be useful for guiding the implementation of viral load with the aim of achieving the new global HIV 90-90-90 goals by 2020."

Among the 403 blood donors, 33 (8.2%), 21 (5.2%), and 27 (6.7%) tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or HBV DNA, HCV RNA, and HDV RNA, respectively. Collectively, 55 donors were viremic for one or more of these viruses, and included 54 first-time donors (18.7%) and 1 repeat donor (0.9%) (P < 0.0001). One discrepant case with HBsAg detectable only at MBC was negative for HBsAg, HBV DNA and anti-HBc in this study. Four donors who were HCV-viremic in this study were negative for anti-HCV by the MBC method. Further efforts to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the currently-used tests are urgently required in Mongolia. Three donors who were positive for anti-HBc and anti-HDV but negative for HBsAg, had both HBV DNA and HDV RNA. This suggests that introduction of a new anti-HDV serological test is useful for not only HDV screening but also HBV screening of anti-HBc-positive, HBsAg negative donors, considering a possibility of viral interference by coexisting HDV."
1255,0.007,7.0,"Fluconazole inhibits cytochrome P-450-mediated enzymatic metabolism of several drugs. Since hepatic metabolism is partially responsible for 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (didanosine or ddI) elimination, fluconazole therapy may lead to increased ddI concentrations in serum and subsequent concentration-dependent adverse effects. The purpose of this study was to determine if ddI pharmacokinetics are influenced by a 7-day course of oral fluconazole. Twelve adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had received a constant dosage of ddI for at least 2 weeks were investigated. On study day 1, multiple serum samples for determination of ddI concentrations were obtained over 12 h. Then subjects received a 7-day course of oral fluconazole (200 mg every 12 h for two doses and then 200 mg once daily for 6 days) while ddI therapy continued. Following the last dose of fluconazole, serum samples for determination of ddI concentrations were again obtained over 12 h. ddI concentrations in serum were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. In contrast to previously published data, there was marked between-subject variability in ddI areas under the concentration-time curve, even when the dose was normalized for weight. No significant differences were found between mean ddI areas under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h on study day 1 (1,528 +/- 902 ngx.hr/ml) and following fluconazole treatment (1,486 +/- 649 ngx.hr/ml) . There were no significant differences in other pharmacokinetic parameters, such as ddI peak concentrations in serum (971 +/- 509 and 942 +/- 442 ng/ml) or half-lives (80 +/- 32 and 85 +/- 21 min.) before and after fluconazole treatment, respectively. We conclude that a 7-day course of oral fluconazole does not significantly alter ddI pharmacokinetics in adults that are infected with human immunodeficiency virus."
7469,0.007,7.0,"Molecular mechanisms related to occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, particularly those based on genotype C infection, have rarely been determined thus far in the ongoing efforts to determine infection mechanisms. Therefore, we aim to elucidate the mutation patterns in the surface open reading frame (S ORF) underlying occult infections of HBV genotype C in the present study. Nested PCRs were applied to 624 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negative Korean subjects. Cloning and sequencing of the S ORF gene was applied to 41 occult cases and 40 control chronic carriers. Forty-one (6.6%) of the 624 Korean adults with HBsAg-negative serostatus were found to be positive for DNA according to nested PCR tests. Mutation frequencies in the three regions labeled here as preS1, preS2, and S were significantly higher in the occult subjects compared to the carriers in all cases. A total of two types of deletions, preS1 deletions in the start codon and preS2 deletions as well as nine types of point mutations were significantly implicated in the occult infection cases. Mutations within the ""a"" determinant region in HBsAg were found more frequently in the occult subjects than in the carriers. Mutations leading to premature termination of S ORF were found in 16 occult subjects (39.0%) but only in one subject from among the carriers (2.5%). In conclusion, our data suggest that preS deletions, the premature termination of S ORF, and ""a"" determinant mutations are associated with occult infections of HBV genotype C among a HBsAg-negative population. The novel mutation patterns related to occult infection introduced in the present study can help to broaden our understanding of HBV occult infections."

We examined whether the addition of community-based accompaniment (characterized by daily home visits from a community health worker, directly observed treatment, nutritional support, transportation stipends, and other support as needed) to the Rwanda national model for antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery would improve retention in care, viral load suppression, and change in CD4 count, relative to the national model alone."
9900,0.007,7.0,"Infection with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) always occurs in association with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. We present a case of severe acute HDV infection superimposed on a previously unrecognized HBV infection, in which an interferon-sparing antiviral therapy consisting of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and lamivudine was initiated and subsequently maintained. Evidence of successful suppression of HDV ribonucleic acid (RNA) was obtained after 65 weeks of TDF-based treatment. This was mirrored by a significant reduction in the levels of HBV DNA and HBV surface antigen. HDV RNA subsequently rebounded after our patient stopped antiviral therapy of his own accord. Interferon-sparing TDF-based antiviral therapy was safe and effective in achieving HDV RNA suppression in acute HDV superinfection. Further research into the utility of interferon-sparing TDF-based regimes in the treatment of acute HDV infection is needed."
7719,0.007,7.0,"Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) remains a leading cause of death for African-American women from 25 to 34 years of age. Depressive symptoms are commonly associated with the diagnosis of AIDS. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is needed for optimal treatment; however, African-American women who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and who experience depressive symptoms have low and/or inconsistent use of HAART. Additionally, behaviors associated with untreated depressive symptoms increase the chances for HIV transmission. Clinicians, therefore, need to recognize both the individual and the contextual factors that influence those seeking treatment for depressive symptoms. The purpose of this article is to gain a better understanding of the factors that shape treatment seeking for depressive symptoms among HIV-positive African-American women, an important variable in secondary HIV prevention. Multi-contextual underpinnings shape this phenomenon; therefore, Bronfenbrenner's ecological framework was used to organize this literature review. Knowledge gained from this paper can support the promotion of health and can prevent or manage depressive symptoms among this vulnerable group."
5894,0.007,7.0,"Approximately 1 million people are infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in Malawi. Despite efforts aimed at changing individual risk behaviors, HIV prevalence continues to rise among rural populations. Both previous research and the Political Economy of Health framework suggest that community-based socio-economic factors and accessibility may influence HIV transmission; however, these community factors have received little empirical investigation. To fill this gap, this research uses data from a nationally representative probability sample of rural Malawians combined with small area estimates of community socio-economic and accessibility data in logistic regression models to: 1) reveal relationships between community factors and individual HIV status; 2) determine whether these relationships operate through individual HIV risk behaviors; and 3) explore whether these associations vary by gender. Community socio-economic factors include relative and absolute poverty; community accessibility factors include distance to roads, cities, and public health facilities. Individual HIV risk behaviors include reported condom use, sexually transmitted infections, multiple partnerships, and paid sex. Results show that higher community income inequality, community proximity to a major road, and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV for women. For men, community proximity to a major road and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV infection. These direct relationships between community factors and individual HIV status are not mediated by individual HIV risk behaviors. The Political Economy of Health frames the discussion. This study provides evidence for expanding HIV prevention efforts beyond individual risk behaviors to consideration of community factors that may drive the HIV epidemic in rural Malawi."
2307,0.007,7.0,"Myeloid cells are important reservoirs of HIV-1 infection. In response to pathogenic agents, macrophages secrete inflammatory cytokines that can modulate viral replication and contribute to AIDS pathogenesis. Because HIV replication is dependent on cellular activation, immunosuppressive cytokines that deactivate macrophages and T cells may be important modulators of an antiviral effect. We tested the anti-HIV potential of the immunosuppressive cytokine-transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta 1) alone and in combination with AZT in a new monomyeloblastic model of HIV-1 infection. The PLB-985 cell model was infected with HIV IIIB strain, and the course of HIV-1 infection and replication was monitored by reverse transcriptase assay, p24 immunofluorescence, and northern blot analysis of HIV-1-specific mRNA. TGF-beta 1 as a single agent had no effect on the multiplication of HIV-IIIB in de novo-infected PLB 985 monomyeloblastic cells. However, cotreatment with TGF-beta 1 and AZT synergistically slowed virus multiplication within the first week following infection, as determined by reverse transcriptase measurement, p24 antigen detection, and northern blot analysis of viral RNA. The synergistic actions of TGF-beta 1 and AZT were also observed in PLB 985 cells infected with an AZT-resistant strain of HIV-1 (HIV 1393). Synergism between nucleoside analogs and cytokines may be an important therapeutic approach to HIV-1 infection. Elucidation of the role of cytokines in controlling the degree of HIV multiplication may have an impact on both clinical treatments and understanding the progression to AIDS."

7068,0.007,7.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection continues to represent a global health concern with an estimated 350 - 400 million people infected worldwide. Current treatment options are either of two IFN-based therapies or either of five oral nucleos(t)ide analogs which are used as monotherapy or in combination. Control of viral replication can be achieved basically in all patients today. However, despite the clinical efficacy of antivirals, long-term management remains a clinical challenge mainly due to the slow kinetics of HBsAg clearance. Emergence of viral resistance has been a challenge in the past with some but not all oral therapies. The development of novel therapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action might provide new opportunities to clear HBsAg and achieve HBsAg seroconversion which could be maintained off therapy. The long-term efficacy of combinations of IFN and/or nucleos(t)ide analogs might achieve antiviral synergy, preventing drug resistance and clearing viral covalently close circular DNA and infected cells."
7090,0.007,7.0,"Raltegravir, as the first HIV integrase inhibitor, has been used and prospectively monitored since 2010 in our HIV outpatient centre, where over 1,200 patients are monitored. The aim of our report is to perform an interim assessment of the background, the safety profile and the clinical-laboratory monitoring of all patients treated with a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including raltegravir, for at least 12 months. In all, 109 pretreated patients started a raltegravir-containing cART when aged 44.8 plus or minus 19.2 years, with a history of HIV infection lasting 13.4 plus or minus 9.7 years. All subjects were monitored for at least 12 months (mean 17.2 plus or minus 10.3 months). In the vast majority of cases (93 of 109: 85.3%), multiple (3-16) prior cART changes prompted raltegravir introduction in advanced-salvage lines: 72 of 109 (66.1%) patients had even developed a concurrent triple-class resistance to anti-HIV compounds. The most frequent companion antiretroviral agents were: darunavir/ritonavir (75 cases), maraviroc (47 subjects), and etravirine (38 cases). The most common underlying conditions were: AIDS (46 patients), liver cirrhosis (31 cases), AIDS-related or other malignancies (23 cases), and major cardio-cerebro-vascular events (18 cases). A chronic HCV and HBV hepatitis were of concern in 48 and 23 patients, respectively. The adjunct of raltegravir favourably affected all clinical-laboratory markers of HIV disease progression, and those of the broad spectrum of comorbidities, except for two patients who failed the raltegravir-containing cART due to insufficient adherence. Despite the already compromised clinical situation, a minority of subjects experienced mild-transient clinical-laboratory untoward events possibly attributable to raltegravir, such that no patients discontinued raltegravir during the observation period. Only three AIDS-defining conditions became apparent during raltegravir-based cART; chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy cycles were performed as scheduled in patients suffering from cancer; chronic hepatitis B and C progressed to liver cirrhosis and/or hepatocarcinoma in only 2 and 6 patients. Otherwise, treatment with pegylated interferon-ribavirin became feasible in 25 patients of 48 with chronic HCV. During raltegravir-containing cART, neither autoimmune disorders nor novel malignancies were diagnosed. Only mild-transient gastrointestinal disorders, fatigue, dizziness, insomnia and cutaneous rash were reported, although their relationship with the study drug was difficult to assess due to multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy. Abnormal liver function testings were observed in 57 patients (52.3%), all suffering from concurrent hepato-biliary disorders. Significant increases in serum lipids and/or lipase levels versus baseline values were never registered: serum lipid levels significantly improved after raltegravir introduction. Our experience with raltegravir underlines its excellent efficacy and safety profile, which exploits a novel mechanism of action, and displays no cross-resistance with any other antiretroviral. A progressively extended prescription in naive patients and early cART lines will allow the therapeutic potential of raltegravir to be exploited. "

Our findings indicate that there are differences by ethnicity and birthplace among Asian Americans in terms of follow-up care and treatment. In addition, our study indicates that there were substantial knowledge gaps regarding contracting HBV, transmission, and prevention. We found that HBV-infected respondents had many fears about their infection. Three primary concerns were identified: (a) concerns related to liver cancer and overall health, (b) transmission to loved ones, and (c) stigma. Our findings indicate that Asian Americans chronically infected with HBV need more education to manage HBV including information on the importance of follow-up treatment and care and education on preventing transmission, risk for liver cancer, and HBV impact on overall health.

5413,0.007,7.0,The increasing impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the health care delivery system requires surveillance of current patterns of HIV-related health care utilization to adequately plan for future needs. Most studies to date have concentrated on inpatient care for patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Outpatient utilization has been less well studied and there are few data regarding HIV-infected patients without a diagnosis of AIDS.
1962,0.007,7.0,"Several infectious agents have been associated with development of lymphoproliferative disorders. Among these is hepatitis C virus (HCV), which infects more than 200 million people worldwide. HCV infection has been linked to progression of type II mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) syndrome and has also been suggested to contribute to development of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Mechanisms responsible for development of lymphoproliferative disorders among HCV-positive patients remain unclear. Accumulating evidence supports a model in which chronic stimulation of B-cells by antigens associated with HCV infection causes nonmalignant B-cell expansion that may evolve into B-cell NHL. The course of disease among HCV-positive B-cell NHL patients may be complicated by coinfection with other infectious agents. This possibility has been explored by studies that have investigated potential interactions between HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as well as between HCV and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Further characterization of the mechanisms by which HCV promotes development of lymphoproliferative disorders may improve diagnosis, classification, and treatment of these conditions."

We hypothesized that food insecurity would be associated with poor virologic response among homeless and marginally housed HIV-positive ARV-treated patients."
8106,0.007,7.0,"We report a case of fulminant leptospirosis that was acquired in New York City by a patient with underlying infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Review of the literature on leptospirosis in HIV-infected persons showed that all patients were severely ill but responded well to treatment, which highlights the importance of recognizing this potentially life-threatening illness, especially in unusual settings."
4117,0.007,7.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates of 8 Ethiopian and 8 Swedish untreated AIDS-patients were examined for their sensitivity to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) and leukocyte-derived interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). No significant difference in drug sensitivity was found between Ethiopian and Swedish isolates, which all were sensitive to AZT, ddI and IFN-alpha except for one Swedish isolate. This isolate exhibited a mutation at amino acid position 215. These results suggest that it should be possible to perform clinical trials in Ethiopia using the same dose regimens as in Sweden."
7542,0.007,7.0,"Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is an important public health issue, because it may affect the outcome of antiretroviral treatment. The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with TDR mutations defined according to the list of the World Health Organization was investigated among 53 therapy-naïve persons with confirmed recent HIV-1 infection diagnosed in Poland, in the years 2008-2010. Proviral DNA was amplified, sequenced, and screened for the TDR mutations in the pol gene fragments coding for the whole protease and the initial 256 residues of the reverse transcriptase. The frequency of sequences with at least one TDR mutation was 11.3%. In four (7.5%) sequences at least one resistance mutation related to reverse transcriptase inhibitors was identified, and in further two (3.8%) sequences one mutation related to protease inhibitors' resistance was present. The moderate rate of TDR highlights the need for a continuous surveillance and resistance testing among treatment-naïve individuals to optimize treatment effects within a country. "
5402,0.007,7.0,"Routine military screening identified human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in an asymptomatic dentist who had three prior negative antibody tests. A look-back investigation evaluated the provider and the practice and provided notification, counseling, and HIV testing for patients. Test results were linked to dental procedures categorized by levels of invasiveness. Of 1631 patients tested, all were negative for antibody to HIV. Analysis of 12,164 procedures on 876 patients determined 20.5% of patients had procedures from the highest stratum of invasiveness; 42% had only low-risk exposure. Stratification of the degree of invasive exposure and clinical evaluation of disease stage in the infected health care worker are important in look-back investigations. The early stage of disease in the provider, the adherence to infection control precautions, and the low percentage of invasive procedures may have contributed to the lack of transmission. These results are consistent with current assessment that risk of transmission of HIV during invasive medical procedures is low."
6641,0.007,7.0,"Considering the changes antiretroviral therapy (ART) has brought to the treatment of HIV infection, the current clinical and laboratory profiles of HIV/AIDS individuals referred to oral health centers are crucially important in instructing dentists about the oral health management of these patients. The aim of the present study was to determine the clinical and laboratory profiles of HIV-infected individuals referred to a clinic for patients with special needs between 2005 and 2012 by retrospectively analyzing their dental records. A total of 97 records of HIV patients referred to the School of Dentistry of Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo - USP, were analyzed. The Mann-Whitney test was used to determine the associations between mean CD4+ counts, mean viral load, and the presence of HIV-related oral lesions (HIV-OL). Most of the patients were male, and their mean age was 38.3 years. Eighty-nine (92%) patients were on regular ART, 77 (79.4%) had a CD4+ count higher than 200 cells/mm3, and 63 (64.9%) had an undetectable viral load. Twenty patients (20.6%) presented with some HIV-OL, including pseudomembranous and/or erythematous candidiasis and angular cheilitis, which were correlated with a low CD4+ count and with an undetectable viral load (p < 0.05). Among the branches of dentistry, periodontics, followed by surgery and restorative dentistry, was the most sought-after specialty, and no intercurrent events were observed during the dental treatment. It may be concluded that there are no restrictions on the dental treatment of patients on regular ART, It is important, though, that the treatment be based on local characteristics and on the prevention of oral diseases. "
87,0.007,7.0,"The purpose of this open and multicenter trial was to determine the usefulness of antibody detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in gingival crevicular transudate (GCT), which was collected with an investigational device (Orasure; Epitope, Beaverton, Oreg.), for the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and to compare it with antibody detection in serum. A total of 1,880 individuals were tested, as follows: 354 HIV-1-infected individuals (111 asymptomatics individuals and 243 individuals with AIDS), 46 individuals with autoimmune diseases (AD), 296 individuals with dental diseases, 42 individuals with other chronic diseases, and 1,142 healthy individuals. Sera from 356 individuals and GCT from 354 individuals were positive for HIV-1 antibodies. There were two false-negative gingival samples, one from an HIV-1-positive asymptomatic individual and one from a patient with AIDS. HIV-1 antibodies were unexpectedly detected in both serum and GCT of two individuals, one with dental disease and one with pulmonary tuberculosis. None of the sera or GCTs from healthy subjects or patients with AD were positive. Compared with the serum assay, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the GCT assay were 99.5, 100, 100, and 99.9%, respectively. Of 355 paired serum-GCT samples that were HIV-1 positive by ELISA and that were tested by Western blot (immunoblot), all were positive for HIV-1 by using the U.S. Public Health Service interpretation criteria, while among gingival samples, 301 were positive, 52 were indeterminate, and 2 were negative. Of 82 negative paired samples selected at random, 80 were negative by Western blotting of serum and GCT and 2 were indeterminate by Western blotting of serum and negative by Western blotting of GCT (a healthy blood donor and a patient with dermatopolymyositis). Testing for HIV-1 antibodies in GCT is a simple and reliable screening procedure in populations with high and low prevalences of infection because of the high sensitivity and specificity of the method, and it offers improved safety for hospital personnel."
1278,0.007,7.0,"HLA and other genetic variants, playing an important role in innate and adaptive immunity, are known to influence tuberculosis (TB) development in HIV-1-positive (HIV+) patients. Because inflammasome genes contribute to HIV-1 susceptibility, we investigated the possible association between polymorphisms in inflammasome genes with HIV-1 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis coinfection (HIV+TB+) in a case/control cohort of Brazilian individuals. Nineteen single-nucleotide polymoprhims in 8 inflammasome genes (NLRP1, NLRP3, AIM2, CARD8, CASP1, IL1B, IL1R, and HSP90) were analyzed in HIV+TB+ Brazilian patients (from Recife, Pernambuco). CARD8 rs6509365 polymorphism was associated with HIV+TB+ (P = 5 × 10(-5)), suggesting a predisposing role of this variant in M. tuberculosis susceptibility in HIV+ subjects (odds ratio = 2.45). This effect is even strong when this allele is combined to CARD8 rs2043211 single-nucleotide polymoprhim. The results of this study support the novel association between CARD8 gene and HIV+TB+ coinfection, demonstrating that inflammasome genetics could influence HIV-1 infection and the development of opportunistic infection."
374,0.007,7.0,"This study set out: (1) to describe resource utilization patterns among four groups of HIV-infected patients at different stages of the disease, and (2) to estimate the direct hospital costs of HIV/AIDS care among these patients in Italy. It is a multi-centre, prospective observational study conducted between August 1997 and July 1998. The 483 patients, enrolled in five infectious diseases departments located in different areas of Italy, were stratified into four groups according to their CD4+ lymphocyte cell count and status of AIDS Defining Illness (ADI) at enrolment. Average direct hospital costs (L = Italian Lire, 1997 exchange rate US$ 1 = 1,704 Italian Lire) were L.23,725,584 (US$ 13,923.5), L.15,208,287 (US$ 8,925.1), L.11,942,761 (US$ 7,008.7) and L.7,660,942 (US$ 4,495.9) for the four groups of patients. More than 80% of patients in the first group and about 65% of patients in the second group received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The proportion of patients receiving HAART in the third and fourth group increased from 37.1% to 56.5% and from 15.3% to 31.5%. The number of hospital days observed in this study was much lower than previously published numbers in Italy. These results may indicate a shift of costs from hospitalisation to outpatient care and ARV."
2926,0.007,7.0,"Several noninvasive blood biomarkers have been established for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but their clinical performance remains inconclusive. Here, we compared the diagnostic performance of these biomarkers and developed a novel algorithm for assessing liver fibrosis. Six hundred and sixteen chronically HBV-infected and treatment-naïve patients who underwent liver biopsy were enrolled and randomly divided into training (N=410) and internal validation cohorts (N=206). One hundred and fifty-nine patients from another centre were recruited as an external validation cohort. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyse the performance of the gamma-glutamyltransferase-to-platelet ratio (GPR), red cell volume distribution width-to-platelet ratio (RPR), FIB-4 index, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and HBV DNA level against liver histology, and a novel algorithm was developed using the recursive partitioning and regression tree (RPART) method. In the training cohort, the area under the ROC curve of FIB-4 was significantly higher than that of APRI (P=.038) but was comparable to those of GPR, RPR and HBV DNA; however, the performance of the biomarkers was similar among the validation cohort. The established RPR-HBV DNA algorithm performed better in the training cohort than any individual blood biomarker, and the corresponding sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 63%, 90%, 72% and 80%, respectively. In the internal and external validation cohorts, the performance of the algorithm in assessing liver fibrosis was also superior to that of other biomarkers. These results suggest that the established RPR-HBV DNA algorithm might improve the diagnostic accuracy of liver fibrosis in treatment-naïve patients with chronic HBV infection, although additional studies are warranted to confirm these findings."
5872,0.007,7.0,"Many HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) continue to use illicit substances despite being in substance use treatment. Substance use is associated with non-adherence to HIV medications; however underlying mechanisms regarding this relation are understudied. The current investigation examined the role of substance use coping in terms of the relation between substance use and HIV medication adherence. Participants were 121 HIV-infected IDUs (41 % female, M age = 47, SD = 7.1) in opioid dependence treatment. Participants completed self-report questionnaires, were administered clinical interviews and oral toxicology screens, and used a medication-event-monitoring-system cap to assess 2 week HIV medication adherence. The use of cocaine and multiple substances were significantly related to decreased medication adherence. Substance use coping mediated these associations. Findings highlight the importance of assessing, monitoring, and targeting ongoing substance use, and ways to increase positive coping for HIV-infected IDUs in substance use treatment to aid in HIV medication adherence."
204,0.007,7.0,Clinical trials were conducted to assess the feasibility of using a cell phone text messaging-based system to follow up Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected patients on antiretroviral (ARTs) and assess for improved adherence to their medication. However there is need to evaluate the perceptions of the HIV infected patients towards the use of these cell phones in an effort to better aid in the clinical management of their HIV infection. The objective of this study was therefore to determine the perceptions of HIV infected patients on the use of cell phone text messaging as a tool to support adherence to their ART medication.
3870,0.007,7.0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has proved effective in prolonging survival and improving the quality of life of the people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). For the successful treatment of HIV infection, at least 95% adherence to HAART is required. This study sought to assess adherence to HAART and to identify factors enhancing adherence within the study population. The study was a descriptive cross-sectional survey of 428 patients attending the antiretroviral (ARV) clinic of the Federal Medical Centre, Makurdi. Self-reported adherence and other data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data were analysed using SPSS 11.0 and Epi6; and were exported into Systat 11 for multivariate logistic regression. There were 151 (35.3%) males and 277 (64.7%) females. The mean age was 36.7 +/- 9.6 years. Self-reported adherence rate was 268 (62.6%). The factor most predictive of adherence to HAART was availability of ARVs [OR = 5.2; 95% confidence interval 3.1-8.6; p < 0.001], followed by the ability to afford regular visits to the ARV clinic [OR = 1.7; 95% confidence interval 1.04-2.8; p = 0.034]. A recent diagnosis of HIV made less than 3 years prior to the study period was also significantly associated with adherence to HAART (chi2 = 8.94; p = 0.003). Availability of ARVs and ability to afford to regularly visit the clinic among other factors, positively influenced adherence to HAART among PLWHA. Efforts should be targeted at constant provision of free ARVs and early initiation of therapy for those requiring treatment, as well as ensuring regular adherence-education."
2450,0.007,7.0,"The risk for dental hygienists to contract HIV and hepatitis B infection at work was studied in an international cohort of 167 dental hygienists from 13 countries. A significant proportion of the hygienists had taken care of HIV-positive patients or patients known to be at risk for contracting HIV infection. None of the hygienists had antibodies to HIV. Five hygienists who came from or worked in high-endemic areas for hepatitis B infection had antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen, consistent with previous infection with hepatitis B virus. The study is in agreement with previous reports on blood-borne infections among health care workers, concluding that the risk for dental hygienists of contracting HIV and hepatitis B infection is minimal."
944,0.007,7.0,"For HIV-infected children, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is often assessed by caregiver report but there are few data on their validity. We conducted prospective evaluations with 191 children ages 0-14 years and their caregivers over 6 months in western Kenya to identify questionnaire items that best predicted adherence to ART. Medication Event Monitoring Systems(®) (MEMS, MWV/AARDEX Ltd., Switzerland) electronic dose monitors were used as external criterion for adherence. We employed a novel variable selection tool using the LASSO technique with logistic regression to identify items best correlated with dichotomized MEMS adherence (≥90 or <90 % doses taken). Nine of 48 adherence items were identified as the best predictors of adherence, including missed or late doses in the past 7 days, problems giving the child medicines, and caregiver-level factors like not being present at medication taking. These items could be included in adherence assessment tools for pediatric patients. "
4806,0.007,7.0,"Medication adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is currently a topic of major importance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome care. HAART has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV infection. Many people with HIV now live active and productive lives, with the disease itself having minimal impact on their lifespan. Unlike treatment for other chronic diseases, achieving the full benefit of HAART requires an extremely high level of adherence to potent antiretroviral combinations that is often difficult to achieve given the high pill burdens, drug interactions and adverse events associated with treatment. In this paper, the present knowledge regarding antiretroviral medication adherence is summarized with a focus on understanding the importance of adherence, the relationship between adherence and treatment response, the challenges and barriers facing patients trying to achieve optimal adherence, reasons for nonadherence, and the current directions and issues relevant to future adherence research."
345,0.007,7.0,"Adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is generally high in most resource-limited settings. However, sub-optimal adherence occurs in a sizable proportion of patients, and is independently predictive of detectable viremia. We investigated sub-optimal adherence according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill assessment methods, and their associated factors among HIV-infected adults receiving cART in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Eight-hundred seventy patients who initiated cART between May 2009 and April 2012 were randomly selected, and 664 patients who were alive, had remained in clinical care and were receiving cART for at least six-months were included. Sub-optimal adherence was defined as patients' response of less than ""all-of the time"" to the self-report adherence question, or any clinician-recorded poor adherence during the six most recent clinic visits, or a pharmacy-refill of <95% medication possession ratio (MPR). Logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with sub-optimal adherence. The average adherence level to cART, expressed as MPR, was nearly 97%. However, sub-optimal adherence occurred in 12%, 4%, and 27% of patients according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill measures, respectively. More satisfaction with social support was significantly associated with less sub-optimal adherence according to self-report and clinician-record. Younger age, lower educational level, and lower CD4 cell count at cART initiation were significantly associated with sub-optimal refill-based adherence. Findings from our large multi-center study suggest that sub-optimal adherence was present in up to a quarter of the patients, despite a high degree of average adherence to cART. Interventions aimed at preventing sub-optimal adherence should focus on improving social support, on younger patients, on patients with lower educational level, and on those who started cART at a lower CD4 cell count."
5740,0.007,7.0,"The atherogenic effects of some highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens, especially those including protease inhibitors (PI), may synergistically promote the acceleration of cardiovascular disease and increase the risk of death from cardiovascular events even in young HIV-infected people. Along with the endothelial dysfunction associated with visceral fat accumulation and related metabolic alterations of HIV-lipodystrophy syndrome (eg, insulin resistance), vascular injury has been associated with HIV-1 infection itself, with an autoimmune reaction to viral infection (vasculitis) and with a direct action of drugs included in HAART regimens. Clinical studies suggest that HIV-infected patients under PI-including HAART and with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors, should be considered at risk for developing coronary artery disease, and that this risk increases with the time of exposure to HAART. A careful cardiovascular screening and monitoring of HIV-infected patients receiving HAART is needed according to the most recent clinical guidelines."
5966,0.007,7.0,"Reports of in vitro resistance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to zidovudine (AZT) have raised concerns about the development of resistance to other dideoxynucleosides in clinical use. To address this, we have developed a screening assay which supports the growth of clinical isolates and have applied this to a series of paired isolates from patients entered into a phase I trial of didanosine (DDI). Thirteen patients (10 with AIDS, 3 with AIDS-related complex) who had been exposed to AZT for a mean of 6.5 months (range, 1 to 13 months) were treated with DDI at 750 mg/day. Paired isolates were obtained pretherapy and after a mean of 58 weeks (range, 21 to 90) of DDI therapy by coculture of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBLs) with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor PBLs. Isolates were passaged only one additional time in PBLs and then tested in parallel in a microtiter assay with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor PBLs as targets. PBLs were infected with 10(5) 50% tissue culture infectious doses per 10(7) cells and exposed to DDI (1 to 50 microM) or AZT (0.01 to 100 microM), and supernatants were assayed for the HIV p24 antigen at 7 days postinfection. Control AZT-susceptible and resistant isolates were included. The median pre- and posttherapy DDI susceptibilities of the 13 pairs of isolates were 10.0 microM (range, 1 to 25 microM) and 17.5 microM (range, 2.5 to 50 microM), respectively (P = 0.036; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These studies thus indicated that (i) the susceptibility to DDI tends to mildly decrease with drug exposure; (ii) the susceptibility to AZT improves with time off AZT; (iii) baseline susceptibilities to DDI have a wide range, and the CD4 response may correlate with the initial susceptibility; and (iv) a PBL-based microtiter assay is useful for screening clinical isolated for dideoxynucleoside susceptibility profiles."
3857,0.007,7.0,"The evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) env gp120 region was addressed in HIV-1 infected children showing virological failure to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Sequence analysis of the replicating plasma virus at baseline and after one year of therapy documented evolution of gp120 in all subjects but one. Analysis of the host's selective pressure showed that the values of Ka/Ks ratios were higher in the V3 sequence than in the whole C2-V5 region in 4 of 5 children with improvement of thymic output. Moreover, in 2 of the 4 chidren, the V3 evolution paralleled with a reverse shift of the viral phenotype (from CXCR4-tropic to CCR5-tropic). These results suggest that, under ART, the V3 evolution towards less pathogenic viral variants may be driven by the host's increased selective pressure following restoration of thymic function and immune reconstitution."
9930,0.007,7.0,"Protection of older persons, particularly those with diabetes, against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is of growing concern because of increased reports of outbreaks among long-term care facility residents receiving assisted blood glucose monitoring. We evaluated hepatitis B vaccine immunogenicity among residents immunized in response to two such outbreaks in skilled nursing facilities during June 2009-July 2010. One hundred forty-eight (71%) of 209 residents were found to be susceptible to HBV infection. Of 105 patients who began a vaccination series with Twinrix(®) (0-, 1-, 6-month dosing), 86 (82%) completed the series and postvaccination testing. Of these, most were elderly (median age 79.5 years; range 45-101), female (56%), and African-American (51%). Twenty-nine (34%) vaccinated residents had post-vaccination hepatitis B surface antibody levels ≥10 mIU/ml. There were no significant differences in vaccine response by age, gender, race, diabetes status, body mass index, or current smoking status. Our findings indicate that a low proportion of skilled nursing facility residents achieved a seroprotective response after hepatitis B vaccination."
1355,0.007,7.0,"Non-adherence is one of the major causes of treatment failure which leads to increased morbidity and mortality caused by opportunistic infections. Optimal anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence is essential for maximal suppression of viral replication and long term survival of patients. In order to develop effective public health interventions in the context of scaling ART services to peripheral areas, it is important to evaluate factors associated with non-adherence among HIV-infected individuals in Pwani Region. The purpose of this study was to identify factors related to non-adherence to ART among HIV infected people in Pwani Region eastern of Tanzania. A case-control study was carried out at Tumbi Hospital and Chalinze Health Centre in Pwani Region in eastern Tanzania. A structured questionnaire was used to assess non-adherence and adherence to doses instruction and time schedule. Patients with less than 95% adherence were defined as cases while those with more than 95% adherence became controls. A structured questionnaire containing factors known to be associated with non-adherence to ART in similar settings was administered. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with non-adherence. A total of 79 cases and 237 controls matched by age and sex were studied. A high proportion of cases and controls (77.2% and 84.8%) had good knowledge ofART benefits, adherence and eligibility. Majority of cases (73.3%) and controls (69.2%) used public transport to access ART services. More than half of cases (53.2%) missed clinic appointments due to lack of bus fare or other reasons and was associated with ART non adherence (mOR 4.2, 95%CI, 2.2-8.1 and 2.1,95%CI 1.2-4.2). Disclosure to confidants only and failure to disclose HIV-test positive status were associated with non adherence (mOR 3.3, 95%CI 1.3-8.5 and 2.3, 95%CI 1.2-7.1). Alcohol use was associated with non adherence to ART (mOR 1.9, 95%CI 1.4-3.7). Patients who were not satisfied with providers were more likely to be non adherence to ART (mOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.2-3.8). In conclusion, these findings show that adherence is a process which is depended on local specific adherence factors. Adherence improvement strategies need to consider site specific adherence determinants, patient experiences and concerns."
763,0.007,7.0,"Abnormal kidney function is common in the course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Here, we performed a cross-sectional analysis using 399 patients within the Aquitaine cohort (a hospital-based cohort of HIV-1-infected patients receiving routine clinical management) to estimate the prevalence of proximal renal tubular dysfunction (PRTD) associated with HIV infection. These patients did not differ statistically by sociodemographics, median age, years since HIV diagnosis, AIDS stage, or median CD4 cell count from the entire 3080 patient cohort. Antiretroviral therapy was received by 352 patients, with 256 given tenofovir (TDF); 325 had undetectable HIV plasma viral load, and 26 were diagnosed with PRTD. In multivariate analysis, significant independent associations were found between PRTD and age (odds ratio (OR) 1.28 per 5-year increase), atazanavir (OR 1.28 per year of exposure), and TDF (OR 1.23 per year) treatment. Among patients having received TDF-containing regimens over a 5-year period, PRTD remained significantly associated with TDF exposure when treatment was ongoing (OR 5.22) or had been discontinued (OR 11.49). Thus, cumulative exposure to TDF and/or atazanavir was associated with an increased risk of PRTD, with concern about its reversibility in patients with HIV."
4530,0.007,7.0,"In the United States, 10 million inmates are released every year, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevalence is several-fold greater in criminal justice populations than in the community. Few effective linkage-to-the-community programs are currently available for prisoners infected with HIV. As a result, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is seldom continued after release, and virological and immunological outcomes worsen. Poor HIV treatment outcomes result from a myriad of obstacles that released prisoners face upon reentering the community, including homelessness, lack of medical insurance, relapse to drug and alcohol use, and mental illness. This article will focus on 5 distinct factors that contribute significantly to treatment outcomes for released prisoners infected with HIV and have profound individual and public health implications: (1) adaptation of case management services to facilitate linkage to care; (2) continuity of cART; (3) treatment of substance use disorders; (4) continuity of mental illness treatment; and (5) reducing HIV-associated risk-taking behaviors as part of secondary prevention."
2549,0.007,7.0,"The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection and risk factors associated to it. Three hundred sixty-one HBsAg chronic carriers from southern Italy were studied and 13.8% of them resulted anti-delta positive. 80% of these subjects were less than 50 years old. When anti-delta positive subjects were compared with anti-delta negative ones, a lower number of healthy HDV carriers and a higher frequency of cirrhotics were noted among anti-delta positive. Of lower than 50 years, imprisonment, sexual contacts with drug abusers and male homosexuality were risk factors of HDV infection. No association was found with sex, household contacts with HBV or HDV carriers, number of family members and transfusion of blood products. These data confirm the high prevalence of HDV infection in southern Italy."
3397,0.007,7.0,"Highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has proven remarkably effective for prolonging the life of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, while most HAART agents are safe, many have the potential to cause liver toxicity. Physicians must therefore consider the possibility of drug-induced liver injury in the management of HIV-infected patients, especially those with certain risk factors such as coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), female gender, alcohol abuse, older age, or obesity. Understanding how, when, and why drug-related liver damage occurs is key to managing these patients safely and effectively. Knowledge of HAART-related liver effects will help ensure that patients receive the most benefit with the least toxicity from any given drug regimen. As more information about the mechanisms of drug related liver injury is known, clinicians will be better able to tailor therapies to suit individual situations, resulting in greater patient safety and outcomes."
240,0.007,7.0,"The genetic heterogeneity and transcription activity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) LTR region and tat gene have been examined. Comparison involved the relevant genomic regions of viruses isolated from twenty long-term survivors and from ten typical progressors. No significant differences were observed in mutation frequencies among the two groups, although there was a significant higher proportion of synonymous substitutions in the tat gene of viruses from typical progressors. Four LTR sequences showed an insertion of 20-31 residues at the junction between the LTR Nef-coding and the LTR noncoding region. Neither these insertions nor other genetic changes found in these sequences affected the LTR transcription function, as measured in transient expression assays using transfection of both established cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes with plasmid DNA. The results did not allow the association of structural or functional alterations in LTR or tat with a degree of disease progression. The results reinforce the concepts of complexity of HIV-1 evolution in infected individuals, and the multifactorial nature of progression to AIDS."
9590,0.006,6.0,"Antiretroviral (ARV) drug toxicities pose treatment challenges and contribute to poor adherence. This study was carried out to document the commonly reported adverse reactions caused by ARV drugs in HIV patients in Tanzania. Information on drug induced adverse reactions (ADRs) in patients using ARV drugs was collected from the databases maintained in HIV clinics of Dar es Salaam and Mbeya. A total of 7502 and 1234 records of patients under ARV therapy by December 2006 were analysed in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya, respectively. In May, 2008 a cross-sectional study was conducted in which, the association between nevirapine (NVP) plasma concentrations and skin rashes problems was determined in 50 patients put on NVP based HAART for less than 2 weeks. Determination of NVP plasma concentration was carried out using a validated HPLC method in which patients from Dar es Salaam were involved. The study revealed that, anaemia, liver toxicity, skin rash and peripheral neuropathy were the most reported ADRs. The NVP plasma level determination revealed that there was no difference between those who had experienced skin rashes and those who did not (mean of 6.05 and 5.5 microg/ml respectively). There was a slight increase in reported ADRs between 2005 and 2006. A total of 932 (12.4%) patients changed their regimen in Dar es Salaam between January 2005 and December, 2006. Similarly, a total of 542 (44%) patients in Mbeya changed their regimen during that period. It can be concluded that, in both Dar es Salaam and Mbeya patients developed ARV related ADRs which are similar to those reported elsewhere."
6073,0.006,6.0,"Immune mechanisms that may control Cryptosporidium parvum infection remain unknown. The role of T cell-mediated immunity is suggested by the chronic disease observed in AIDS patients and in athymic or CD4+ T cell-depleted mice. The role of specific antibodies is also unclear. This study sought to determine serum and secretory antibodies to C. parvum in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with or without chronic cryptosporidiosis. C. parvum-specific antibodies and specific secretory antibodies were determined by ELISA in saliva and sera from 50 HIV-1-infected patients, 27 healthy adults, and 21 healthy children. Despite lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts, patients with chronic cryptosporidiosis had increased levels of C. parvum-specific antibodies in saliva and serum and higher specific secretory antibody levels in saliva than did controls. Persistence of protracted diarrhea despite high levels of both serum and secretory antibodies suggests that specific secretory antibodies are not sufficient to control this protozoan parasite infection of intestinal mucosa."
3352,0.006,6.0,"Psychosocial conditions such as depression, intimate partner violence (IPV), and history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) have been associated with poor HIV-related outcomes. In India, which has the third largest HIV epidemic in the world, little is understood about the impact of psychosocial conditions on people living with HIV (PLHIV). We aimed to understand the prevalence and correlates of psychosocial conditions among PLHIV entering into HIV care at the Y.R. Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education in Chennai, India. Thirteen questions were added to the standard voluntary counseling and testing questionnaire, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (a depression scale) and questions assessing for CSA and IPV. We fitted logistic regression models, stratified by gender, with psychosocial condition as the outcome of interest and substance use variables and socio-demographic variables as the correlates of interest. Three hundred and eighty-three persons were enrolled into the study; of these, 253 (66%) tested positive for HIV, including 149 men and 104 women, and were included in the models. More than one-quarter (28%) of the men and 19% of the women reported at least one psychosocial condition (probable depression, CSA, or IPV). In adjusted analysis, current alcohol use was associated with greater than two times higher odds of a psychosocial condition (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 2.24, 95% CI, 1.04-4.85) among men. In conclusion, we estimated the prevalence of probable depression, CSA, and IPV among PLHIV presenting for HIV care in southern India and found that, among male PLHIV, alcohol use was associated with a markedly higher odds of reporting a psychosocial condition. Further study is needed to characterize alcohol use among male PLHIV and the possible deleterious impact of psychosocial conditions and alcohol use on HIV-related outcomes in India."
6306,0.006,6.0,"Risk factors for HIV-1 infection among women were assessed through a population-based cross-sectional study in the Arusha region of northern Tanzania. The study participants were obtained by randomly selecting 10-household clusters from Unga limited, the town of Babati, and the roadside village of Matufa, which are urban, semi-urban, and rural communities, respectively. Informed verbal consent for participation in an interview and in HIV-1 testing was sought from each respondent. Blood samples were collected from each consenting individual for HIV-1 antibody testing using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and all positive sera were confirmed using repeated ELISA tests. Information of risk factors was obtained through the interview process using a structured questionnaire. Of the 567 women who gave blood samples, 48 (8.5%) were HIV-1 positive. The HIV-1 seroprevalence rates among women in the urban area, the semi-urban area, and the rural village were 14.4%, 6.9% and 2.3%, respectively. Factors associated with significantly higher HIV-1 seroprevalence were urban residence; history of having traveled out of the Arusha region within Tanzania, as well as having traveled abroad; having multiple sex partners; and having sexual intercourse under the influence of alcohol. Women who reported ever having used condoms had significantly higher probability of being infected with HIV-1 than those who had never used condoms, suggesting that condom use may be a marker of high-risk sexual behavior and that condom use is probably not adhered to in a way that consistently protects against HIV-1 infection. These results suggest the need for health education interventions aimed at increasing appropriate and consistent condom use and reduction of the number of sexual partners."
6966,0.006,6.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) expresses two structural forms of the nucleoprotein, the intracellular nucleocapsid (hepatitis core antigen [HBcAg]) and the secreted nonparticulate form (hepatitis e antigen [HBeAg]). The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of HBcAg- and HBeAg-specific genetic immunogens to induce HBc/HBeAg-specific CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell immune responses and the potential to induce liver injury in HBV-transgenic (Tg) mice. Both the HBcAg- and HBeAg-specific plasmids primed comparable immune responses. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were important for priming/effector functions of HBc/HBeAg-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses. However, a unique two-step immunization protocol was necessary to elicit maximal CTL priming. Genetic vaccination did not prime CTLs in HBe- or HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice but elicited a weak CTL response in HBcAg-Tg mice. When HBc/HBeAg-specific CTLs were adoptively transferred into HBc-, HBe-, and HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice, the durations of the liver injury and inflammation were significantly greater in HBeAg-Tg recipient mice than in HBcAg-Tg mice. Importantly, liver injury in HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice was similar to the injury observed in HBeAg-Tg mice. Loss of HBeAg synthesis commonly occurs during chronic HBV infection; however, the mechanism of selection of HBeAg-negative variants is unknown. The finding that hepatocytes expressing wild-type HBV (containing both HBcAg and HBeAg) are more susceptible to CTL-mediated clearance than hepatocytes expressing only HBcAg suggest that the HBeAg-negative variant may have a selective advantage over wild-type HBV within the livers of patients with chronic infection during an immune response and may represent a CTL escape mutant."

In Rwanda HIV-infected individuals who are also infected with HBV are supposed to be initiated on ART immediately. HBV is easily transmitted from mother to child during delivery. We sought to estimate the prevalence of chronic HBV infection among pregnant women attending ante-natal clinic (ANC) in Rwanda and to determine factors associated with HBV and HIV co-infection.
9735,0.006,6.0,"Coinfection by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis viruses is a frequent condition in drug addicts. In the present study we report on the case of a patient with a history of drug and alcohol abuse who was sequentially infected with HIV, HCV, HBV and HDV. He died of an overwhelming reactivation of HBV and HDV in spite of a recent interferon treatment. HBV and HDV resumed their active replication after over 20 years of complete latency, that is after long-lasting viral undetectability, when the patient deliberately discontinued his last HAART regimen. HBV and HDV reactivated in spite of a relatively preserved immune system and a recent immune stimulatory treatment with pegylated interferon."
9760,0.006,6.0,"The prevalence of serum markers of delta hepatitis was determined prospectively in 82 intravenous drug abusers at various stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Seventeen were HIV negative, 30 were HIV positive without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 35 had been diagnosed as having AIDS. Antihepatitis D virus (HDV) in serum was measured by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and also by solid phase capture radioimmunoassays (RIAs) for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HDV. HDV antigen and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA were also measured. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HBs were determined by using a commercially available RIA. Anti-HDV (RIA) was only detected in serum that contained HBsAg. These anti-HDV (RIA) positive samples also tested positive with the commercial anti-HDV electroimmunoassay. In addition, the commercial anti-HDV ELISA detected anti-HDV in some serum samples that were negative for HBsAg; these anti HDV-positive HBsAg-negative samples were frequently lipemic or contained rheumatoid factor. The prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBs did not differ significantly with the stage of HIV disease. HBsAg was detected in 3 of 13 (23%) HIV-negative, 5 of 29 (17%) HIV-positive, and 4 of 18 (22%) patients with AIDS. IgG and IgM anti-HDV (RIA) was positive in 2 of 3 HIV-negative and 4 of 5 HIV-positive pre-AIDS HBsAg-positive subjects. However, none of 4 AIDS patients had anti-HDV. The difference between AIDS and non-AIDS patients was statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.03). HDV antigen was detected in serum from one AIDS patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5738,0.006,6.0,"The objective of this study was to estimate the presence of hepatitis delta virus RNA in chronically HBV-infected patients from northern Poland. Three out of 63 studied samples (4.8%) were positive in a qualitative test for total antibodies to HDV antigen. Five samples (7.9%) turned out to be HDV-RNA-positive by RT-PCR, four of them were sequenced in the region of L-HDAg, and phylogenetic analysis was performed. All four examined samples belonged to genotype I. Two RNA-positive/anti-HD-negative samples possessed a few uncommon nucleotide substitution sites within the L-HDAg sequence, which could suggest unique variants in the Polish population of HDV-infected patients."
6718,0.006,6.0,"The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act 1990 (CARE Act) is one of the largest federal programmes funding medical and support services for individuals with HIV disease. Data that report services and gaps in service coverage from the organizational perspective are very limited. The Antiretroviral Treatment and Access Studies included a mail survey of 176 HIV medical care facilities in four US inner cities on clinic characteristics, services and practices, and patient characteristics. Characteristics of 143 (85%) responding Ryan White (RW) funded and non-RW funded facilities are described. RW funded facilities reported offering more services than non-funded facilities including evening/weekend hours (49% vs. 18%), transportation (71% vs. 22%), and on-site risk reduction counselling (88% vs. 55%). More RW funded facilities reported offering on-site adherence support services, such as support groups (44% vs. 12%), formal classes (20% vs. 2%), and pillboxes (83% vs. 43%), and served a larger proportion of uninsured patients (41% vs. 4%) than non-funded facilities. Our analysis showed that the RW funded HIV care facilities offered more clinic, non-clinic, and adherence support services than non-RW funded facilities, indicating that the disparities in services were still related to CARE Act funding, controlling for private-public facility type."
7280,0.006,6.0,"The aim of this study is to detect the possible association of hepatitis B virus (HBV) core mutation, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status and the viral load in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Sixty-six patients with CHB were enrolled. Hepatitis markers and hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV-Ab) were tested using micro particle enzyme immunoassay kits. Viral load was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the mutation was analyzed by nested PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Most of CHB patients were HBeAg (-ve). The HBeAg status did not have an influence on the presence or absence of T1762/A1764 mutation. HBV-DNA serum level was not significantly different in patients with core mutation and patients without core mutation in HBeAg (-ve) group, while in HBeAg (+ve) group HBV-DNA serum level was significantly higher in patients with core mutation. This study reports the predominance of HBeAg (-ve) and HBV core promoter mutation."
5606,0.006,6.0,"Molecular clones of HIV-1 were obtained from isolates cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and directly from uncultured PBMCs from a laboratory worker accidentally infected with the HIV-1 laboratory strain, HIV-1(HTLV-IIIB). Envelope sequences corresponding to the first 752 amino acids of HIV-1(HTLV-IIIB) clone BH10 were obtained from clones of cultured virus and sequenced. Three env clones obtained shortly after infection differed among themselves at only seven nucleotide positions, resulting in one amino acid substitution and one frameshift mutation. These envelope sequences were as similar to the envelope sequences of various IIIB clones as the latter were to each other. env divergence increased over the course of infection. However, the overall diversity in env clones obtained two or more years after infection was still comparable to that among IIIB env clones from the original IIIB culture. Multiple clones of partial env gene sequences containing the V3 loop were also obtained directly from uncultured PBMCs by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The env sequences of these clones were generally similar to those of the cultured viruses. Within the V3 region, the earliest isolates retained the sequence of the HXB2 clone from IIIB. Clones obtained later showed a progressive divergence in V3. An A-to-T substitution within the GPGRAF sequence at the tip of the V3 loop was observed within 1 year after infection, and this mutation predominated in all subsequent isolates. Antibodies against the V3 loops of IIIB and divergent 1987 and 1990 LW isolates appeared simultaneously in laboratory worker serum and persisted with no significant differences in titer. Furthermore, neutralization studies with autologous sequential sera suggested selection for the A-to-T change in V3 was not due to V3-directed antibodies. These results demonstrate a surprising homogeneity among env sequences of HIV-1 from an infected laboratory worker, perhaps because the initial infection originated from a relatively homogeneous population of tissue culture-adapted virus."
118,0.006,6.0,Coinfection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a substantial medical and public health concern due to its increasing prevalence and complex patient management. Alcohol use may worsen HCV-related liver disease and interfere with adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and medical care. We therefore studied the association between HCV infection and markers of HIV disease progression in adults with alcohol problems.
821,0.006,6.0,"Recurring outbreaks of acute hepatitis have been a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among Peruvian military personnel stationed in the Amazon Basin region of Peru. The role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection was investigated as the possible cause of acute hepatitis among 88 military patients stationed at four different jungle outposts during 1992-1993. Analysis of serum markers indicated that 95% (84/88) had evidence of acute HBV infection; 64% (54/84) were also infected with HDV. Genetic analysis of PCR-amplified HDV and HBV fragments showed exclusively HDV genotype III and HBV genotype F. Furthermore, HDV RNA sequences were similar among patients from the same outpost but different from those at other jungle locations. The data suggested focal sources of HDV infection in the jungle environment of the outposts and, further, confirmed the unique association of HDV genotype III with severe cases of human disease in northern South America."
8299,0.006,6.0,"The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of basal core promoter (BCP) and precore gene (PC) mutations in hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolates among the Nicobarese tribe and their relationship with genotypes and HBeAg status. A total of 726 blood samples were collected from two villages of the Car Nicobar Island where mass vaccination was performed in the year 2000. HBV DNA was isolated and the BCP and PC regions were amplified and sequenced directly. The samples positive for HBV DNA were tested for HBsAg, HBeAg and anti-HBe. Among the 211 and 515 samples collected from vaccinated and nonvaccinated persons, 16 and 82 were positive for HBV DNA, respectively. Among the vaccinated individuals, only 1 had a mutation in both the BCP and PC gene. Among the nonvaccinated subjects, 3 (4.5%) had an A1762T mutation, 8 (12.1%) had a G1764A mutation, 11 (16.7%) had a G1896A mutation and 4 (6.1%) had a G1899A mutation. The HBeAg-negative subjects had a significantly higher frequency of BCP and PC mutations than the HBeAg-positive subjects. The prevalence of a PC mutation was higher than that of a BCP mutation. The present study stresses the need for the continuous surveillance of subjects with BCP and PC mutations, as the mutations may contribute to the progression of liver disease."
4552,0.006,6.0,"Patients with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection have more severe hepatitis-related disease than do patients with HCV infection alone. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with protease inhibitor appears to restore pathogen-specific immune responses, especially in patients with persistent undetectable HIV viral load. To evaluate the potent impact of immune restoration induced by HAART on the course of HCV-related disease, HCV viremia and levels of transaminases were compared between two groups of patients: 10 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with persistently undetectable HIV viremia (group A) and 12 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with persistent detectable HIV viremia. No difference was detected in HCV viral load in either group. An increase in transaminases was found only in patients with persistent undetectable HIV viral load, which was correlated with the increase in CD8+ T cells. This may suggest that the restoration of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity could lead to an enhancement of hepatitis C-related disease in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients receiving HAART."
4913,0.006,6.0,"Human immunodeficiency (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses are endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa, but data regarding the prevalence of hepatitis co-infections in HIV-positive individuals residing there are limited. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of HBV, HCV, and occult HBV (presence of HBV-DNA in the absence of HBsAg) in a rural, South African cohort. The results were compared to various ethnic groups in a Dutch cohort of people infected with HIV. Antiretroviral-naïve individuals with HIV from both a rural South African clinic (n = 258), and a Dutch University hospital (n = 782), were included. Both serological (HBV and HCV) and molecular (occult HBV) assays were performed. Logistic regression analysis was used to define independent predictors of a hepatitis co-infection. HBV and HCV prevalence rates in the South African cohort were exceptionally low (0.4%, 1/242 and 0.8%, 2/242, respectively), compared to those observed in Caucasians (HBV 4.4% and HCV 10.9%) and African immigrants (HBV 8.9% and HCV 4.8%). Conversely, occult HBV was observed in a considerable proportion (10%, 6/60) of South African patients who were anti-HBc-positive but HBsAg-negative. Occult infections were less frequent in Caucasians and Africans in the Dutch cohort (3.2% and 1.4%, respectively). Independent predictors for occult HBV were not identified, but a trend towards more occult HBV at lower CD4 counts was observed. Local HBV/HCV prevalence data are needed to optimize vaccination and antiretroviral treatment strategies. Occult HBV in patients with HIV may be missed regularly when molecular analyses are not available."
2192,0.006,6.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are thought to play a major role in the immune response to HIV infection. The HIV-specific CTL response is much stronger than previously documented in an infectious disease, yet estimates of CTL frequency derived from limiting-dilution analysis (LDA) are relatively low and comparable to other viral infections. Here we show that individual CTL clones specific for peptides from HIV gag and pol gene products are present at high levels in the peripheral blood of three infected patients and that individual CTL clones may represent between 0.2% and 1% of T cells. Previous LDA in one donor had shown a frequency of CTL precursors of 1/8000, suggesting that LDA may underestimate CTL effector frequency. In some donors individual CTL clones persisted in vivo for at least 5 years. In contrast, in one patient there was a switch in CTL usage suggesting that different populations of CTLs can be recruited during infection. These data imply strong stimulation of CTLs, potentially leading some clones to exhaustion."

5202,0.006,6.0,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor in the development of chronic hepatitis (CH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The activation‑induced cytidine deaminase (AID)/apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide‑like (APOBEC) family of cytidine deaminases is significant in innate immunity, as it restricts numerous viruses, including HBV, through hypermutation‑dependent and ‑independent mechanisms. It is important to induce covalently closed circular (ccc)DNA degradation by interferon‑α without causing side effects in the infected host cell. Furthermore, organisms possess multiple mechanisms to regulate the expression of AID/APOBECs, control their enzymatic activity and restrict their access to DNA or RNA substrates. Therefore, the AID/APOBECs present promising targets for preventing and treating viral infections. In addition, gene polymorphisms of the AID/APOBEC family may alter host susceptibility to HBV acquisition and CH disease progression. Through G‑to‑A hypermutation, AID/APOBECs also edit HBV DNA and facilitate the mutation of HBV DNA, which may assist the virus to evolve and potentially escape from the immune responses. The AID/APOBEC family and their associated editing patterns may also exert oncogenic activity. Understanding the effects of cytidine deaminases in CH virus-induced hepatocarcinogenesis may aid with developing efficient prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against HCC."
1316,0.006,6.0,"Project HEART, an acronym for Helping Enhance Adherence to Retroviral Therapy, was a prospective, controlled study to develop, implement, and evaluate a clinic-based behavioural intervention to prevent adherence failure among HIV-infected adults beginning their first highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen (N = 227). In this paper, we describe the conceptualisation of the Project HEART adherence intervention, characteristics of the participants, and lessons learned implementing HEART in an inner-city clinic setting. A multi-component intervention, HEART combined enhanced education, reminders, adherence feedback, social support and adherence-focused problem solving in an integrated manner to address common cognitive, motivational, and social barriers to adherence. Unique components of the intervention included use of participant-identified adherence support partners and a standardized adherence barriers assessment to develop and implement individualised adherence plans. Lessons learned regarding the feasibility of using participant-identified support partners were as follows. Few participants eligible for the study had trouble identifying a support partner. Over 90% of support partners attended at least one intervention visit. Support partners were most available and amenable to participate early in the initiation of therapy. Participants' experiences as the 'supported' partner were generally positive. Though many participants faced barriers not easily addressed by this intervention (for example, housing instability), formally integrating support partners into the intervention helped to address many other common adherence barriers. Family and friends are an under-utilised resource in HIV medication adherence. Enlisting the help of support partners is a practical and economical approach to adherence counselling."
3760,0.006,6.0,"Liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver disease is complicated by HBV recurrence and, consequently, poor patient and graft survival. Patients transplanted for hepatitis delta virus (HDV)-related cirrhosis are reported to have a diminished incidence of HBV recurrence and improved graft survival. However, only a few reported HDV-infected patients had active HBV replicative disease before liver transplantation. In our experience, we transplanted two HDV-infected patients, both of whom had active HBV replication before liver transplantation. In one patient, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) recurred four months after transplantation. Two months later, Hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) and HBV-DNA became positive, and the patient died of fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. In the other patient, HBV persisted after transplantation, and 2 months later the patient required retransplantation for fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. With the second graft, the patient remained free of HBV infection for 1 year. Thereafter, the patient experienced HBV recurrence with active replication and died of fulminant hepatitis B and delta recurrence. In the first case and in the second graft of the second case, hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) immunoprophylaxis was administered in an attempt to prevent recurrence of HBV. The literature suggests that an HDV infection inhibits the replication of HBV and therefore plays a role in preventing the recurrence of HBV and improving survival. Our experience with two patients suggests that HDV infection, in the presence of active HBV replication, may not play a protective role."
5564,0.006,6.0,"Adolescent Impact, a developmentally targeted behavioral intervention aimed at decreasing risk behaviors and promoting health care adherence, was delivered to 83 HIV-infected youth, aged 13-21 years, receiving care in five urban HIV centers. Participants completed a patient satisfaction survey following the 12 part intervention consisting of seven groups and five individual sessions. A feedback questionnaire was also completed during each group session to gain more insight on participant experiences. Several indicators suggested high levels of satisfaction. First, overall attendance was relatively high. Second, participants rated their subjective experience and group content favorably. No differences in satisfaction ratings emerged between perinatally infected adolescents and those who acquired HIV through risk behaviors. However, differences emerged regarding perceived intervention utility and content-specific preferences. Findings suggest that Adolescent Impact participants were satisfied with the intervention and that a heterogeneous group of HIV-infected youth could be advantageously integrated into the same secondary prevention program."
7864,0.006,6.0,"The high levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg)-bearing subviral particles in the serum of chronically infected individuals play an important role in suppressing HBV-specific immune response and are only mildly affected by the current small molecule therapies. Thus, a therapy that specifically reduces HBsAg serum levels could be used in combination therapy with nucleos(t)ide drugs or permit therapeutic vaccination for the treatment of HBV infection. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel triazolo-pyrimidine inhibitors (1, 3, and 4) of HBsAg cellular secretion, with activity against drug-resistant HBV variants. Extensive SAR led to substantial improvements in the EC(50) of the parent compound, 5 (HBF-0259), with the best being 3c, with EC(50) = 1.4 ± 0.4 μM, SI ≥ 36. The lead candidates, both 1a (PBHBV-001) and 3c (PBHBV-2-15), were well-tolerated in both normal and HBV-transgenic mice and exhibited acceptable pharmacokinetics and bioavailability in Sprague-Dawley rats."
5923,0.006,6.0,"The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy and remarkable success in the treatment of paediatric HIV infection has changed the face of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic in children from a fatal disease to that of a chronic illness. Many children living with HIV are surviving into adolescence. This sub-population of people living with HIV is emerging as a public health challenge and burden in terms of healthcare management and service utilization than previously anticipated. This article provides an overview of the socio-developmental challenges facing adolescents living with HIV especially in a resource-limited setting like Nigeria. These include concerns about their healthy sexuality, safer sex and transition to adulthood, disclosure of their status and potential stigma, challenges faced with daily living, access and adherence to treatment, access to care and support, and clinic transition. Other issues include reality of death and implications for fertility intentions, mental health concerns and neurocognitive development. Coping strategies and needed support for adolescents living with HIV are also discussed, and the implications for policy formulation and programme design and implementation in Nigeria are highlighted."
2231,0.006,6.0,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been associated with increased rates of single- and multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis in the New York City area. In order to examine the relationship of HIV infection to drug-resistant tuberculosis in other selected regions of the United States, we established a registry of cases of culture-proven tuberculosis. Data were collected from sites participating in an NIH-funded, community-based HIV clinical trials group. All cases of tuberculosis, regardless of HIV status, which occurred between January 1992 and June 1994 were recorded. Overall, 1,373 cases of tuberculosis were evaluated, including 425 from the New York City area, and 948 from seven other metropolitan areas. The overall prevalence of resistance to one or more drugs was 20.4%, and 5.6% of isolates were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin (MDR). In the New York City area, HIV-infected patients were significantly more likely than persons not known to be HIV-infected, to have resistance to at least one drug (37% versus 19%) and MDR (19% versus 6%). In other geographic areas, overall drug resistance was 16%, and only 2.2% of isolates were MDR. In multiple logistic regression analyses, HIV infection was shown to be a risk factor for drug-resistant tuberculosis, independent of geographic location, history of prior therapy, age, and race. We concluded that HIV infection is associated with increased rates of resistance to antituberculosis drugs in both the New York City area and other geographic areas. MDR tuberculosis is occurring predominantly in the New York City area and is highly correlated with HIV infection."

The aim of our study was to (a) determine the prevalence of HDV infection in patients with chronic hepatitis C (b) compare it with the prevalence of HDV infection in HBsAg positive patients with hepatitis B. The study group consisted of 51 chronic hepatitis C patients, 30 HIV infected drug addicts (27 of them were also positive for anti-HCV) and 102 hepatitis B patients. The participants were tested for anti-HDV, anti-HCV and HBsAg. All anti-HCV positive patients were negative for anti-HDV. Four individuals with anti-HDV belonged to hepatitis B group and constituted 3.9% of all HBsAg positive subjects. We conclude that (a) there is currently no evidence of HDV infection among HCV infected patients in our region (b) hepatitis delta infection is rare in north-eastern Poland."
3966,0.006,6.0,"Assiduous measures are taken to prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to infants; it is unclear whether the mothers receive appropriate care for their chronic HBV. We sought to assess the quality of HBV care in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers following pregnancy. HBsAg-positive women (n = 243) who had sought prenatal care at Massachusetts General Hospital were retrospectively identified and charts reviewed. The primary outcome was adherence to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines. Over one-third (37%) of women were first diagnosed with HBV infection at a prenatal visit. One-third (32%) did not undergo timely liver function test measurements. HBV DNA was never measured in 26% and was untimely in 34% of patients. One-third (34%) of the women were at high-risk for HCC based on AASLD criteria, yet only 33% of these women underwent timely imaging. Nearly half (49%) never saw a liver specialist for their HBV care. In multivariate analysis, women were 3.7 times more likely to have a timely ALT and 8.1 times more likely to have a timely HBV DNA if they were followed by a liver specialist (P = 0.001, <0.001). We demonstrate remarkably inadequate and discontinuous HBV care for chronically infected mothers following pregnancy. As HBV infection is already being identified prenatally, quality improvement measures encompassing obstetricians, primary care providers and hepatologists are needed to ensure that HBV-infected women are linked to care postpregnancy."
4228,0.006,6.0,"The present study sought to extend prior work, showing an association between self-reported distress tolerance and self-reported antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence, by conducting a multimethod test of the association between distress tolerance and objective measures of ART adherence among a sample of 140 individuals (23.6% female) with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Findings indicated that, after accounting for negative affectivity and ART side-effect severity, distress tolerance was significantly associated with pill count adherence as well as viral load. Specifically, a differential association was observed whereby self-reported distress tolerance was associated with pill count adherence, whereas behavioral distress tolerance was associated with viral load. Importantly, no associations were observed between either measure of distress tolerance and CD4 count. Findings are discussed in terms of the importance of both behavioral and perceived distress tolerance assessment among patients with HIV as well as potential clinical implications related to the integration of distress tolerance-focused treatments into existing interventions for individuals with HIV."
8238,0.006,6.0,"The care of the HIV-infected patient in the emergency department has changed since the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy. This therapy has resulted in longer life expectancies and increased quality of life for HIV-infected patients, and in cases of treatment compliance and success, virtual elimination of AIDS-associated opportunistic infections. As a result, the emergency clinician is now more often confronted with adverse events related to medication and the diseases associated with aging and chronic disease. This issue focuses on the differences in evaluation of HIV patients on long-term therapy and patients with medication noncompliance and low CD4 counts, as well as recognition of life-threatening and rare opportunistic infections. Disease processes related to the effect of longstanding HIV infection, even with good control, on many organ systems are addressed. "
1123,0.006,6.0,"In the last two decades, HIV-1, the retrovirus associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is globally one of the primary causes of morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, existing approaches for interventions are not able to suppress the progression of infection due to this virus. Of the many obstacles, viral entry into the mono-nuclear phagocyte system encompassing monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is a major concern. Viral infection is also responsible for the subsequent distribution of the virus into various tissues throughout the organism. Tremendous progress has been made during the past few years to diagnose and treat patients with HIV/AIDS infection, yet much remains to be done. Recommended treatment involves long-term and multiple drug therapy that causes severe side effects. With almost 12% of the world population suffering from HIV/AIDS, better management of this global threat is highly desired. Nanostructured delivery systems hold promise for improving the situation. Such systems can facilitate the uptake of antiretroviral drugs, causing a considerable improvement in HIV/AIDS therapy. Nanoscale systems have intriguing potential to drastically improve existing HIV/AIDS diagnosis and treatment platforms. Nanosystems constitute a wide range of systems varying from polymeric nanoparticles, to solid-lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, micro- and nanoemulsions, dendrimers, and self-nanoemulsifying systems. Improved bioavailability, solubility, stability, and biocompatibility make them an ideal choice for delivery of antiretroviral drugs. The present review initially describes an updated bird's-eye view account of the literature. Then, we provide a relatively sententious overview on updated patents of recent nanostructured delivery systems for antiretroviral drugs. Finally, we discuss low-cost therapy (such as antioxidants and immune modulators) for the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS. "
2586,0.006,6.0,"The level of genetic variation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a member of the lentivirus genus of the Retroviridae family, is high relative to that of retroviruses in some other genera. The high error rates of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in cell-free systems suggest an explanation for this high genetic variation. To test whether the in vivo rate of mutation during reverse transcription of HIV-1 is as high as predicted by cell-free studies, and therefore higher than that rates of mutation of retroviruses in other genera, we developed an in vivo assay for detecting forward mutations in HIV-1, using the lacZ alpha peptide gene as a reporter for mutations. This system allows the rates and types of mutations that occur during a single cycle of replication to be studied. We found that the forward mutation rate for HIV-1 was 3.4 x 10(-5) mutations per bp per cycle. Base substitution mutations predominated; G-to-A transition mutations were the most common base substitution. The in vivo mutation rates for HIV-1 are three and seven times higher than those previously reported for two other retroviruses, spleen necrosis virus and bovine leukemia virus, respectively. In contrast, our calculated in vivo mutation rate for HIV-1 is about 20-fold lower than the error rate of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, with the same target sequence. This finding indicates that HIV-1 reverse transcription in vivo is not as error prone as predicted from the fidelity of purified reverse transcriptase in cell-free studies. Our data suggest that the fidelity of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase may not accurately reflect the level of genetic variation in a natural infection."
4427,0.006,6.0,"In recent years, it has become apparent that the lung is an important niche for the proliferation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which may have implications for highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The lung itself is a major site for the opportunistic infections associated with the progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), specifically Pneumocystis carinii, Myobacterium tuberculosis and pyogenic bacteria. These cases of active pulmonary complications are direct indicators of enhanced progression to AIDS-defining illness and increased morbidity and mortality. It is therefore essential that the interaction between the lung and HIV is fully understood. Recent research indicates the lung may be a major sanctuary for the virus, with distinct evolution and replication in contrast to other target organs for HIV. In this review, we will discuss the recent findings of HIV infection, evolution, host factors involved in the control of HIV within the lung and the impact this may have on current therapy."
8417,0.006,6.0,"HIV-positive refugees confront a variety of challenges in accessing and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and attaining durable viral suppression; however, there is little understanding of what these challenges are, how they are navigated, or how they may differ across humanitarian settings. We sought to document and examine accounts of the threats, barriers and facilitators experienced in relation to HIV treatment and care and to conduct comparisons across settings. We conducted semi-structured interviews among a purposive sample of 14 refugees attending a public, urban HIV clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (July-September 2010), and 12 refugees attending a camp-based HIV clinic in Kakuma, Kenya (February-March 2011). We used framework methods and between-case comparison to analyze and interpret the data, identifying social and environmental factors that influenced adherence. The multiple issues that threatened adherence to antiretroviral therapy or precipitated actual adherence lapses clustered into three themes: ""migration"", ""insecurity"", and ""resilience"". The migration theme included issues related to crossing borders and integrating into treatment systems upon arrival in a host country. Challenges related to crossing borders were reported in both settings, but threats pertaining to integration into, and navigation of, a new health system were exclusive to the Malaysian setting. The insecurity theme included food insecurity, which was most commonly reported in the Kenyan setting; health systems insecurity, reported in both settings; and emotional insecurity, which was most common in the Kenyan setting. Resilient processes were reported in both settings. We drew on the concept of ""bounded agency"" to argue that, despite evidence of personal and community resilience, these processes were sometimes insufficient for overcoming social and environmental barriers to adherence. In general, interventions might aim to bolster individuals' range of action with targeted support that bolsters resilient processes. Specific interventions are needed to address locally-based food and health system insecurities. "
330,0.006,6.0,"A total of 105 single fresh stool samples were collected from diarrhoeal patients with (80 HIV-positive and 25 HIV-negative) from the Army and the Police hospitals, Addis Ababa. The stool samples were processed by water-ether sedimentation method; they were stained with Uvitex-2B technique for microscopic detection of intestinal microsporidium. A portion of all samples were preserved in 200microl PBS containing 2% PVPP ((Polyvinylpolypyrolidone) for confirmation with PCR. 18/105(17.2%) of the cases were positive for intestinal microsporidial infection by at least one method. 8/105 (7.6%) positive both by microscopy and PCR and 10/105 (9.5%) were positive only by PCR. All microsporidia positive cases were also HIV positive. Based on PCR analysis, 15 Enterocytozoon bieneusi and 3 Encephalitozoon intestinalis were identified. This study has shown that intestinal microsporidiosis is a common cause of chronic diarrhoea in advanced AIDS patients and this is mainly attributed to Enterocytozoon bieneusi. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of intestinal microsporidiosis in Ethiopia. It has an important implication for the understanding of the aetiology of diarrhoea in HIV/AIDS patients in the country."
9794,0.006,6.0,"Viral liver diseases are frequent comorbidities and major contributors to death in HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Although cure of hepatitis C and control of hepatitis B with antivirals avert liver disease progression in most HIV-coinfected patients, the lack of satisfactory treatment for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection remains a major threat for developing cirrhosis and liver cancer in this population. In the European Union (EU) and North America, sexual contact has replaced injection drug use that has been the major transmission route for HDV in HIV-positive persons. PegIFNα is the only approved HDV therapy; however, sustained HDV-RNA clearance is achieved by less than 25%. The recent discovery of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide as the key hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV cell entry receptor has opened the door to a new therapeutic era. Indeed, promising results have been released using Myrcludex-B, a sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide inhibitor. More encouraging are data with new classes of HDV blockers, such as prenylation inhibitors (i.e. lonafarnib) and nucleic acid polymers. At this time, sustained suppression of HDV replication is the primary goal of HDV therapy, as it is associated with normalization of liver enzymes and histological improvement. Of note, the use of specific antivirals for HDV must be given along with anti-HBV agents to prevent HBV rebounds following removal of viral interference. The lack of persistent forms of HDV-RNA could provide a unique opportunity for curing hepatitis delta, even without eliminating HBV circular covalently closed DNA. Ultimately, suppression of HDV replication along with hepatitis B surface antigen clearance once drugs are off would be the best reflect of hepatitis delta cure."
5087,0.006,6.0,"Live virus vaccines can cause serious adverse reactions when administered to immunocompromised patients. Because children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be immunosuppressed, immunization of these children with live virus vaccines is a potential problem. A retrospective survey was conducted by the New York City Department of Health, with consultation from the Centers for Disease Control, to evaluate the frequency of serious adverse events following receipt of live vaccines among children with HIV infection receiving pediatric care in New York City and New Jersey. Outpatient records of 319 children being cared for by 16 participating physicians were reviewed. Of the 319 charts, 221 (69%) contained vaccination histories. Perinatal transmission of HIV infection was suspected for 208 (94%) of the 221 cases and infection via transfusion for the remaining 13 (6%). Of the 221 for whom immunization histories were available, 180 (81%) had received at least one dose of live oral polio vaccine and 70 (32%) had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. There were 120 children for whom a temporal relationship between immunization and onset of symptoms of immunodeficiency could be seen; 46/120 had received at least one dose of oral polio vaccine and 23/45 had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine after onset of symptoms. Although follow-up of this population has been limited, there were no reports of serious adverse events such as typical or atypical measles, paralytic poliomyelitis, or aseptic meningitis in the month following vaccination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7356,0.006,6.0,"The characteristics of intra-host human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) env evolution were evaluated in untreated HIV-1-infected subjects with different patterns of disease progression, including 2 normal progressor [NP], and 5 Long term non-progressor [LTNP] patients. High-resolution phylogenetic analysis of the C2-C5 env gene sequences of the replicating HIV-1 was performed in sequential samples collected over a 3-5 year period; overall, 301 HIV-1 genomic RNA sequences were amplified from plasma samples, cloned, sequenced and analyzed. Firstly, the evolutionary rate was calculated separately in the 3 codon positions. In all LTNPs, the 3rd codon mutation rate was equal or even lower than that observed at the 1st and 2nd positions (p = 0.016), thus suggesting strong ongoing positive selection. A Bayesian approach and a maximum-likelihood (ML) method were used to estimate the rate of virus evolution within each subject and to detect positively selected sites respectively. A great number of N-linked glycosylation sites under positive selection were identified in both NP and LTNP subjects. Viral sequences from 4 of the 5 LTNPs showed extensive positive selective pressure on the CD4-binding site (CD4bs). In addition, localized pressure in the area of the IgG-b12 epitope, a broad neutralizing human monoclonal antibody targeting the CD4bs, was documented in one LTNP subject, using a graphic colour grade 3-dimensional visualization. Overall, the data shown here documenting high selective pressure on the HIV-1 CD4bs of a group of LTNP subjects offers important insights for planning novel strategies for the immune control of HIV-1 infection."
57,0.006,6.0,"We wished to undertake molecular characterization of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene and overlapping surface (S) gene in lamivudine-treated patients with chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sequencing analyses of the HBV RT/S gene of isolates from 25 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with the YMDD mutation and 30 treatment-naïve CHB patients were undertaken. In patients with the YMDD mutation, rtM2041 was the major type of mutation (20/25, 80%). rtL80I was present in most of the patients with rtM204I (14/20, 70%). rtL180M coexisted with rtM204V (5/5, 100%). Patients with the YMDD mutation had a significantly higher prevalence of mutation of the RT gene than treatment-naïve CHB patients (P < 0.05). Classical primary resistance and secondary/compensatory mutations were detected at only five sites (rtL80, rtV173, rtL180, rtM204, rtM250) in CHB patients with the YMDD mutation. The frequency of nucleos(t)ide analog resistance (NAr) mutation within the RT gene in patients with the YMDD mutation was significantly higher than that in treatment-naïve patients (P < 0.05). Amino-acid mutations within the RT gene were also associated with other types of NAr in patients with the YMDD mutation. The rate of amino-acid variants within the S gene region was significantly higher in patients with the YMDD mutation than that in treatment-naïve patients (P < 0.05). sM133L and sG145R variants were also present in patients with the YMDD mutation. These observations suggest that CHB patients with the YMDD mutation also have NAr mutations related to other NA drugs, which might lead to cross-resistance in CHB patients. Variants present in the S gene region could cause changes in the antigenicity of HBsAg, which could result in a false-negative diagnosis of HBsAg and immune in escape of the HBV."

2416,0.006,6.0,"Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) constitute the main burden of infectious disease in resource-limited countries. In the individual host, the two pathogens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV, potentiate one another, accelerating the deterioration of immunological functions. In high-burden settings, HIV coinfection is the most important risk factor for developing active TB, which increases the susceptibility to primary infection or reinfection and also the risk of TB reactivation for patients with latent TB. M. tuberculosis infection also has a negative impact on the immune response to HIV, accelerating the progression from HIV infection to AIDS. The clinical management of HIV-associated TB includes the integration of effective anti-TB treatment, use of concurrent antiretroviral therapy (ART), prevention of HIV-related comorbidities, management of drug cytotoxicity, and prevention/treatment of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

9637,0.006,6.0,"Since 1996, AIDS has declined in the Italian population, but cases in foreign patients, including both recent immigrants and long-term residents, have increased from 3.9% in 1995-1996 to 15.4% in 2001-2002. This increase can only be partly explained by a higher migratory flow and might reflect a delayed access to health facilities and to antiretroviral therapy in migrants. We performed a survey for the year 2003 of HIV-infected immigrants to Italy from countries outside the European Union to verify which factors might influence a lack of access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Italian centers of infectious diseases were requested to send sociodemographic and clinical data of HIV-infected immigrant patients. A total of 553 HIV-infected immigrants (49.9% women) were evaluated, representing 6.5% of all HIV-infected patients from these centers. The mean duration of residency in Italy was 6.6 +/- 5.0 years. The country of origin was Africa (64.5%), North and South America (24.2%), Eastern Europe (7.0%), and Asia (3.8%). A total of 407 of 553 patients (73.6%) were taking antiretroviral drugs at the time of screening. Females presented a younger age (p = 0.001), a lower frequency of Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stage B/C (p = 0.008) and a more frequent heterosexual exposure to HIV (p < 0.001), while no differences were observed for time of first positive serology (p = 0.7). CD4 cell count (p = 0.9) and log plasma HIV-RNA (p = 0.1). Characteristics of HAART patients were compared to those of nontreated patients, despite a CD4 cell count less than 350 cells/mm(3). No significant difference was found for gender, country of origin, risk factor, and years of Italian residence, while legal immigrants (p = 0.018) and registered in the National Health Service (p = 0.014) were significantly more likely to receive HAART compared to illegal immigrants."
3494,0.006,6.0,"During the period May 1987 to November 1989, the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers was determined by ELISA in serum samples of 7405 (55% male, 45% female) apparently healthy persons 3-19 years of age in Italy. Earlier studies of adults there had shown an intermediate degree of HBV endemicity (hepatitis B surface antigen carrier rate greater than 2%). Persons were selected by systematic cluster sampling in five different geographical areas of Italy. The overall prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was 0.6%. The overall prevalence of at least one marker of HBV was 2.8%; it increased from 1.7% among children 3-5 years of age to 4.5% in teenagers 17-19 years of age (P less than 0.001). The prevalence of any HBV marker was higher in southern then in northern areas (3.5% vs. 1.8%, P less than 0.001). A significant association was found with sociodemographic features. Persons whose fathers had less than 6 years of schooling had a 2.3-fold risk (C.I. 95% = 1.5-3.4) while those belonging to a household of six or more under one roof had a 1.7-fold risk (C.I. 95% = 1.2-2.4) of previous exposure to HBV infection. These findings indicate that, today in Italy, exposure to HBV infection at a young age is very low and suggest a shift towards a low degree of endemicity following improvements in socio-economic conditions, decreased family size and increasing use of disposable syringes during recent years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
1145,0.006,6.0,"Long-term medication regimen adherence is challenging in all populations, but in the HIV-infected adolescent population the frequency of poverty, homelessness, substance abuse, and mental illness make highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence even more challenging. In 2003, we developed a pilot program for HIV-infected adolescents and young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 who were either going to begin a HAART regimen for the first time or begin a new HAART regimen. Participants received a free cell phone with a local service plan for approximately 6 months. Participants received phone call reminders for 12 weeks. Call frequency was tapered at 4-week intervals. Patients were assessed at 4-week intervals to determine the perceived intrusiveness or helpfulness of receiving calls, and missed medication doses. Eight consecutive patients were recruited for the study, and five were able to complete it through the 24 weeks. Most participants found the calls to be helpful and the level of intrusion into their daily lives acceptable. Using cell phone reminders to assist patients does not require an extensive amount of daily staff time. Tapering calls rapidly over 3 months, followed by discontinuation of calls provided inadequate support for subjects, especially those with significant psychosocial issues such as substance abuse. Use of cell phone reminders to assist adolescents adhere with HIV medications was practical and acceptable to pilot study participants. Viral suppression waned for all but two patients after termination of cell phone reminders and suggests that a 12-week intervention was not adequate for most subjects. Larger prospective studies of cell phone observation of therapy will be needed to determine if this intervention can improve long-term adherence and health outcomes."
2034,0.006,6.0,"Due to their shared transmission route, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infections can be observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cases and are associated with more severe clinical courses. The detection of HBV DNA despite HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seronegativity is defined as occult HBV infections. According to the current seroepidemiological data, Turkey is classified as an intermediate HBV, low HIV endemic region. Occult HBV infections have previously been reported from Turkey but has not been investigated previously in HIV infected cohorts. The aim of this study was to identify occult HBV infections in HIV-infected persons. Twenty-eight HIV-positive cases followed-up at Hacettepe University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Unit were included in the study after informed consent. For the detection of HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HCV, commercial ELISA tests (Architect System, Abbott Diagnostics, USA) were employed. Absolute CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined via flow cytometry. HIV viral load was calculated via COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA) and the presence of HBV DNA was evaluated via COBAS TaqMan HBV Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA), in addition to a nested PCR assay targeting HBV S gene. The mean age of the study group was 43.2 (range between 27-65) years, 64.3% (18/28) of them were males and the mean duration of HIV infection was 4.2 (2-11) years. Mean CD4+ ve CD8+ T-cell counts were 414 ± 267 cells/mm3 and 854 ± 293 cells/mm3, respectively. Twenty-six (92.8%) cases were under highly-active anti-retroviral therapy at the time of the study, 88.5% of which included HBV-active drugs (lamivudine or tenofovir). HIV RNA were found negative in 11 (39.3%) patients, of those nine (81.8%) were the cases who treated with HBV-active antiretroviral therapy. HBsAg were negative in all of the 28 patients, while the positivity rates of anti-HBs and anti-HCV were 39.3% (11/28) and 3.6% (1/28), respectively. All samples were negative for HBV DNA via the commercial real-time PCR and in-house nested PCR assays. The absence of occult HBV in the study group may indicate the absence of occult HBV or suppression of viral replication due to the anti-retroviral therapy. In conclusion, further large-scale studies are required to fully understand the impact of occult HBV in HIV-infected patients in Turkey."
8821,0.006,6.0,"Estimates of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection prevalence varies among different studies depending on the prevalence of HBV infection in the study population and on the sensitivity of the assay used to detect HBV DNA. We investigated the prevalence of occult HBV infection in cirrhotic patients undergoing liver transplantation in a Brazilian referral center. Frozen liver samples from 68 adults were analyzed using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay for HBV DNA. The specificity of the amplified HBV sequences was confirmed by direct sequencing of the amplicons. The patient population comprised 49 (72.1%) males and 19 (27.9%) females with a median age of 53 years (range=18-67 years). Occult HBV infection was diagnosed in three (4.4%) patients. The etiologies of the underlying chronic liver disease in these cases were alcohol abuse, HBV infection, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Two of the patients with cryptic HBV infection also presented hepatocellular carcinoma. Markers of previous HBV infection were available in two patients with occult HBV infection and were negative in both. In conclusion, using a sensitive nested polymerase chain reaction assay to detect HBV DNA in frozen liver tissue, we found a low prevalence of occult HBV infection in cirrhotic patients undergoing liver transplant, probably due to the low prevalence of HBV infection in our population.

4418,0.006,6.0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly reduced the risk of early death from opportunistic infections and extended the lifespan of people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Thus, many complications and organic damage in the HIV-infected population emerge. Cardiovascular disease as coronary artery disease has become a matter of particular concern. Its incidence is greatly increased in the HIV-infected population over that of people of the same age in the absence of general cardiovascular risk factors. Despite several clinical and laboratory studies in the association between HIV infection and cardiovascular disease, the pathogenic mechanisms of this significant clinical problem are largely unknown and are now under active investigation. Endothelial dysfunction is possibly the most plausible link between HIV infection and atherosclerosis. Increased expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and endothelial adhesion molecule (E-selectin) and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL-6 has been reported in HIV-positive patients. The effect of HAART on endothelial function in HIV-positive patients is also demonstrated. In this review, we focus on the recent research update of HIV-associated vascular disease and vascular injury. We analyze and discuss the recent clinical and laboratory investigations on the effect of HIV, viral protein, and HAART therapy on endothelial injury and vascular disease; identify the areas of controversy and clinical relevance; and suggest some directions for future research."

In this study, a search was therefore made for nucleotide mutations in the basic core promoter (BCP) and amino-acid substitutions in the precore/core region of HBV infecting patients with CAH or with acute hepatitis. The nucleotide sequences of the BCP and of the precore/core region were determined in virus from ten patients with CAH and ten with acute hepatitis. The precore/core sequences were also analysed in 14 additional patients (6 with CAH, 8 with acute hepatitis). In seven of the ten patients with CAH, five types of mutations were found in the BCP. Deletions in the precore/core region were observed in six patients. In all six patients where only the precore/core region was studied, amino-acid substitutions were present. In contrast, in the ten patients with acute hepatitis studied for BCP, a mutation was found in the BCP of one patient only. Of the 18 patients in whom the precore/core was studied, three had an amino-acid substitution in this region. The results show a clear link between CAH and both HBV BCP and precore/core region mutations, suggesting these mutations may play a role in the persistence of HBV infection."
7287,0.006,6.0,"Human hepatitis delta (delta) virus (HDV) is a form of defective virus, which infects humans only in the presence of a co-infecting hepatitis B virus (HBV). HDV superinfection in a chronic HBV carrier often results in severe chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, whereas acute HDV and HBV co-infection is frequently associated with fulminant hepatitis. HDV consists of a 36-nm particle, which contains an envelope with HBV surface antigen, and a nucleocapsid containing the hepatitis delta-antigen (HDAg) and an RNA genome of 1.75 kilobases (kb). Recently, the genomic RNA from an HDV serially passaged in chimpanzees has been cloned and sequenced in a study which showed that the HDV RNA is a single-stranded circular molecule with properties similar to those of viroid or virusoid. However, it is not known whether serial passages in chimpanzees had altered the properties of human HDV. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of an HDV RNA isolated directly from a patient with acute delta-hepatitis. The sequence showed considerable divergence (11%) from that of the chimpanzee-adapted HDV. Five open reading frames (ORFs) of more than 100 amino acids in both genomic and anti-genomic sense were found. The largest ORF in antigenomic sense, which can code for 214 amino acids, may correspond to the HDAg."
1577,0.006,6.0,"Negative and discriminatory attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are one of the biggest experienced challenges by people suffering from HIV, and these attitudes have been regarded as a serious threat to the fundamental rights of all infected people who are affected or associated with this disease in Iran. This study aimed to determine the relationship between public perception about HIV/AIDS and discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA . The present study was conducted using a descriptive and survey design. Data were collected from 450 patients (236 male and 214 female) in Tehran and Yazd cities. The research instruments were modified HIV-related knowledge/attitude and perception questions about PLWHA, and discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA. The results showed that prevalence of discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA in the studied population was 60.0%. There was a significant negative correlation between citizens' awareness about HIV/AIDS, HIV-related attitudes, negative perception toward people with HIV/AIDS symptoms and their discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA (p < .01). The hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that components of public perception about HIV/AIDS explained for 23.7% of the variance of discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA. Negative public perceptions about HIV/AIDS in Iran associated with discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA and cultural beliefs in Iran tend to stigmatize and discriminate against the LWHA. "
8848,0.006,6.0,"Using the Southern blot technique and cloned hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA as a probe, we studied the state of HBV DNA in the liver of 13 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 17 patients with chronic hepatitis, and 2 patients with acute hepatitis. The hybridization results were compared with the serological and immunohistological data. Integration of HBV DNA in cellular DNA of the liver from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was demonstrated. In two patients from which tumorous and nontumorous liver tissue samples were available the integration patterns were different. In one patient with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive early hepatocellular carcinoma, free viral DNA was present in the liver. In some patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis, without tumor, integration of HBV DNA in cellular DNA was also demonstrated. This suggests that HBV is not the only factor involved in the development of a tumor. In patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis, free viral DNA was detected in the liver. In the two acute hepatitis patients analyzed, the restriction endonuclease patterns strongly suggested HBV DNA integration. Therefore, viral DNA integration seems to occur early in infection. Whatever the form of the disease, discrete bands were observed, suggesting the existence of limited and specific integration sites in host cellular DNA. The presence of integrated or free DNA sequences has implications for antiviral therapy. In addition, detection of HBV DNA in the liver is another sensitive viral marker that could be useful for diagnostic purposes."
3820,0.006,6.0,"Multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains with reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations at codons A62-->V, V75-->I, F77-->L, F116-->Y, and Q151-->M have been reported in patients receiving combination therapy with zidovudine (AZT) and didanosine (ddI). Infectious clones with each mutation alone, all five mutations together, and various combinations of mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation Q151-->M conferred partial resistance to AZT, ddI, zalcitibine, and stavudine, whereas a combination of four mutations conferred increased resistance to AZT, ddI, zalcitibine, and stavudine. The positions of residues 75, 77, and 151 in the three-dimensional crystal structure of HIV-1 RT suggest that these residues may affect the ability of the enzyme to discriminate between deoxynucleoside triphosphates and nucleoside analog RT inhibitors. Replication experiments showed that clones with mutation F77-->L but without V75-->I (HIV-1(77), HIV-1(77,151), and HIV-1(77,116,151) had attenuated growth compared with that of the original HIV-1NL4-3 strain and strains containing mutations at both positions 75 and 77 (HIV-1(75,77,151) and HIV-1(75,77,116,15)). Sequence analysis of viral RNA and proviral DNA from several patients indicated that RT mutations developed in a sequential and cumulative pattern over the course of a 2- to 4-year observation period. The present results suggest that drug resistance and viral replicative capacity both may play a role in selection of HIV-1 RT mutations."
4629,0.006,6.0,"It has been well known that the transmission of HB virus is associated with mass inoculation and other medical procedures. In order to make clear the relation between HBV infection and the mass survey for filariasis on which sera of the examinees were drawn from their earlobes for the detecting of microfilaria with inadequately sterilized instruments, a epidemiological study was conducted in Miyako district. Okinawa prefecture, Japan, in which both HBV infection and filariasis were prevalent. A total of 2,231 inhabitants were investigated for HBV seromarkers. The over all positive rate of HBs antigen was 6.3% with the highest rate of 15.5% in the group of age 25 to 29. On the other hand, the prevalence rate of HBs antibody continued to increase along with age group, and remained to be over 60% after 30 years of age. The positive rates of both HBs antigen and antibody in the subject district were higher than those in other place of Okinawa prefecture or Japan. Comparing yearly attack rates of HBV chronologically, which were calculated from the age-specific HBV exposure rates in the district, the annual incidence of HBV infection was 6.1% (%/year) between 1954 to 1958, 5.2% (%/year) between 1959 to 1963, and then 4.4 (%/year) in the period of 1964 to 1968 in which the proportion of examinees for the survey of filariasis was the highest. In conclusion, the mass survey for filariasis was not the main factor contributing to the high prevalence of HBV infection in Miyako district."

8033,0.006,6.0,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of nevirapine in combination with didanosine and stavudine in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1-infected Chinese patients in routine clinical practice. The study, from April 2003 to May 2005, with follow-up through 24 mo, was conducted at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Second Xiangya Hospital, Central-South University in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. Twenty-seven HIV1-infected patients received didanosine, stavudine, and nevirapine. Information from case notes regarding age, sex, side effects, viral load, naive and memory T cells, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell count at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo was collected and analyzed. Virologic suppression, defined as an HIV RNA concentration of less than 50 copies/mL at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24, was considered the main outcome measure. Of 27 patients, 17 were men with a mean age 33.5 yr. The mean baseline viral load was 5.15 log copies/mL and the mean CD4(+) cell count was 185 cells/dL. Of 27 patients, 3 patients discontinued study medication; treatment was changed, because of side effects, from didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), and nevirapine (NVP) to zidovudine, lamivudine, and NVP for 24 patients who had completed 24 mo of treatment with ddI, d4T, and NVP; and viral load suppression was attained in 17 patients (70.8%) at 12 mo, in 14 patients (58.3%) at 18 mo, and in 13 patients (56.6%) at 24 mo. The CD4 T cell count increased by 114 cells/microL (mean, 299 cells/microL) after 12 mo of treatment and by 132 cells/microL (mean, 317 cells/microL) after 24 mo of treatment. Naive T cells and memory cells also increased in number, but at a slower rate. Activated (CD38(+)) CD8(+) T cells were elevated at baseline (67.7%) and declined by month 24 (49.7%), but did not reach normal levels. We conclude that a regimen of NVP with ddI and d4T provided durable suppression of plasma viral load in HIV-infected patients, with significant improvement in the CD4 cell count, and can be well tolerated by patients with HIV-1 infection."
6657,0.006,6.0,"Sub-Saharan Africa is disproportionately burdened by intestinal helminth and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. Recent evidence suggests detrimental immunologic effects from concomitant infection with the two pathogens. Few studies, however, have assessed the prevalence of and predictors for intestinal helminth infection among HIV-1-infected adults in urban African settings where HIV infection rates are highest. We collected and analyzed sociodemographic and parasitologic data from 297 HIV-1-infected adults (mean age = 31.1 years, 69% female) living in Lusaka, Zambia to assess the prevalence and associated predictors of helminth infection. We found at least one type of intestinal helminth in 24.9% of HIV-infected adults. Thirty-nine (52.7%) were infected with Ascaris lumbricoides, and 29 (39.2%) were infected with hookworm. More than 80% were light-intensity infections. A recent visit to a rural area, food shortage, and prior history of helminth infection were significant predictors of current helminth status. The high helminth prevalence and potential for adverse interactions between helminths and HIV suggests that helminth diagnosis and treatment should be part of routine HIV care."
5836,0.006,6.0,"Since hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural 3 (NS3) protease inhibitor (PI) combined with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (PR) has been approved for chronic HCV genotype (GT) 1b infection, a reliable and clinically useful predictor combining with serum HCV RNA to predict early virologic response, breakthrough, and relapse is important during HCV antiviral treatment. We evaluated the role of HCV NS3 antigen (HCV NS3Ag) on the prediction of virologic response in patients with HCV GT1b during PR or PR/simeprevir (triple) therapy. Three hundred patients were recruited, and HCV RNA and HCV NS3Ag were tested at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72. NS3Ag and HCV RNA were significantly related (r(2) = 0.67) in the whole patient selection. The kinetic pattern of HCV RNA and HCV NS3Ag during triple treatment was similar. HCV NS3Ag levels in the triple group closely followed those of HCV RNA; the r(2) values were 0.756 (baseline), 0.837 (2 weeks), 0.989 (4 weeks), and 0.993 (12 weeks), respectively. For patients treated with PR, the positive and negative predictive values (PPVs and NPVs) for viral response were 96.31 % and 67.19 %, respectively, at week 4 by using the decrease of NS3Ag (dHCV NS3Ag) combined with HCV RNA. At week 12, the PPV was similar at 94.16 %, while the NPV reached 87.26 %. The PPV and NPV for the prediction of relapse and breakthrough were 90.6 % and 76.7 %, respectively. HCV NS3Ag is a valuable marker and could be a supplementary predictor of HCV RNA for the prediction of antiviral response, breakthrough, or relapse during HCV antiviral treatment. "
257,0.006,6.0,"The response to regimens including lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r) in patients who have received multiple protease (PR) inhibitors (PI) can be analyzed in terms of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genotypic and pharmacokinetic (pK) determinants. We studied these factors and the evolution of HIV-1 resistance in response to LPV/r in a prospective study of patients receiving LPV/r under a temporary authorization in Bordeaux, France. HIV-1 PR and reverse transcriptase sequences were determined at baseline LPV/r for all the patients and at month 3 (M3) and M6 in the absence of response to treatment. pK measurements were determined at M1 and M3. Virological failure (VF) was defined as a plasma viral load >or=400 copies/ml at M3. A multivariate analysis of the predictors of VF, including clinical and biological characteristics and the treatment history of the patients, was performed. The PR gene sequence at M0, including individual mutations or a previously defined LPV mutation score (D. J. Kempf, J. D. Isaacson, M. S. King, S. C. Brun, Y. Xu, K. Real, B. M. Bernstein, A. J. Japour, E. Sun, and R. A. Rode, J. Virol. 75:7262-7269, 2001), and the individual exposure to LPV were also included covariates. Sixty-eight patients were enrolled. Thirty-four percent had a virological response at M3. An LPV mutation score of >5 mutations, the presence of the PR I54V mutation at baseline, a high number of previous PIs, prior therapy with ritonavir or indinavir, absence of coprescription of efavirenz, and a lower exposure to LPV or lower LPV trough concentrations were independently associated with VF on LPV/r. Additional PI resistance mutations, including primary mutation I50V, could be selected in patients failing on LPV/r. Genotypic and pK parameters should be used to optimize the virological response to LPV/r in PI-experienced patients and to avoid further viral evolution."
78,0.006,6.0,"Despite the increasing prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease in the population and the increasing likelihood that HIV-positive (HIV+) patients may have an extraction, little is known about the risk of postoperative complications in this group. The goal of this investigation was to assess the risk of postoperative complications in HIV+ patients after tooth extraction. The study was designed as a retrospective cohort study with a sample consisting of 145 males who underwent tooth extraction. The patients' medical and dental records were reviewed to identify HIV serostatus, to document the frequency and type of postoperative complications, and to collect data on potential confounding variables. Forty-four patients were identified as HIV+. The postoperative complication rate in HIV+ patients was 20.9% and for HIV-negative (HIV-) patients 2.9% (relative risk = 7.0, 95% confidence interval = 2.0-25.0, P = 0.001). Furthermore, as the manifestations of the symptoms of HIV infection became more severe, the postextraction complication rate also increased (P = 0.008). The results of this study suggest that HIV+ patients have an increased risk of postextraction complications and as the level of HIV disease increases, the risk of complications also increases. While the findings of this study are consistent with studies based on case series, prospective cohort studies are required to confirm the findings."
9347,0.006,6.0,"Type and prevalence of zidovudine (ZDV) resistance mutations in HIV-1-infected children in clinically stable condition and on ZDV monotherapy were analyzed to evaluate the effect of switching to didanosine (ddI) monotherapy or to ZDV plus ddI on the pattern of mutations and on the clinical outcome. Monthly clinical and laboratory controls for HIV-1 infection status were performed; at enrollment and every 4 to 6 months after treatment randomization mutant proviral sequences were evaluated in all the children, whereas viral burden was performed only in a small subgroup of patients randomly selected in each of the three treatment groups. ZDV resistance-associated proviral DNA mutations were defined as low-level resistance (LLR) mutations or medium/high-level resistance (MHLR) mutations; clinical outcome was considered as stable or deteriorating. Results showed that at entry into the study the duration of ZDV therapy was significantly correlated with the presence of mutations, and that the level of resistance given by mutations was associated with the severity both of symptoms and immunodeficiency. After randomization to treatment, in patients with mutations that confer LLR a better clinical outcome with ddI monotherapy than with ZDV plus ddI and ZDV alone was observed in the subsequent 6 months, whereas in patients with mutations that confer MHLR no significant difference among the three treatment groups was found. Data showed also that levels of viral burden at the time of changing therapy are related to clinical outcome if measured by plasma viral load. These results suggest that genotypic resistance assays, together with viral load, may prove useful for rational treatment decisions both at the start of therapy and with failure."
5487,0.006,6.0,"Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) receive numerous medications from multiple providers. As a result, it is important that medication usage is properly documented in each patient's medical record. Lack of adequate documentation may confound a provider's assessment of drug efficacy, potentially leading to an increased incidence of drug interactions and adverse effects. The objective of this study was to determine if discrepancies exist between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record by healthcare providers. Data were obtained using structured telephone surveys and medical chart review. Study participants were recruited from the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center AIDS Clinic. Results obtained for 41 patients demonstrated discrepancies between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record ranging from 9 to 92 percent, depending on the class of drug. The largest differences were observed with the ""as-needed"" class of drugs: benzodiazepines (92 percent), morphine (60 percent), and codeine (56 percent). Differences were also noted for scheduled medications: ketoconazole (54 percent), clotrimazole (45 percent), acyclovir (38 percent), zidovudine (15 percent), and pentamidine (9 percent). These observed discrepancies reaffirm the need for accurate exchange of information between provider and patient to promote the most effective, rational, and safe drug therapy. Careful reviews of medication usage at each visit and use of pharmacy-based medication profiles are potential mechanisms to improve documentation of medication usage in HIV-infected patients."
3086,0.006,6.0,"To explore demographics, clinical and medication profiles, patients' social support, and perceived health status in HIV/TB coinfected patients in Guangxi, China.We performed a cross-sectional study in the HIV clinic of the Guigang City People's Hospital (N = 150). Health professionals conducted face-to-face interviews and collected data from patients' electronic medical records regarding patients' demographic, clinical, and medication information, as well as their social support and perceived health status. We classified all HIV/AIDS patients into HIV monoinfected and TB coinfected, at a ratio of 2:1.Compared with the HIV monoinfected, patients with HIV/TB coinfection were more likely to be older, male, less educated, unemployed, carrying health insurance, having advanced stage of HIV infection, longer history with HIV, and other opportunistic infections. Patients coinfected with TB were also more likely to hold a negative belief that their HIV treatment could prevent exacerbations, and reported significantly worse emotional/informational support, social interaction, and perceived health status. Better social support and better self-efficacy to the HIV treatment adherence was significantly associated with better perceived health status among patients with HIV and TB coinfection.Having HIV/TB coinfection was associated with poorer perceived general well-being and mental health, particularly in those undergoing TB therapy. Our findings suggest the need for mental health referrals and medication management for coinfected individuals, as well as further efforts and policies to improve coordinated care."
2113,0.006,6.0,"HIV-1 sequences from perinatally infected children were analyzed in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region and nef in order to investigate associations of viral variation and disease progression. Four long-term survivors who reached 10 years of age or older, and four rapid progressors who survived less than 2 years, participated in this study. LTR sequences of multiple independent viral variants from each individual were compared. No sequence pattern within the LTR consistently distinguished long-term survivors from rapid progressors or vice versa. Deletions and insertions within transcription factor binding sites of the LTR and nef ranging from 8 to 341 bp were found in viral variants from the eldest long-term survivor (LTS047). These deletions and duplications may be associated with the survival of LTS047 via an unknown mechanism. Among all children in this study, the sites in the untranslated region (NF-kappaB, SP1, and TATA box) were more conserved than the sites in the nef/LTR overlap region (NFAT, purine-rich region, USF, TCF1alpha), reflecting the importance of the sites in the untranslated region for viral replication. A mutation in the E box motif within the USF site among the sequences from a long-term survivor (LTS113) is predicted to disrupt protein binding and may be associated with slow disease progression. Mutations of the SP1-III site in a rapid progressor (RP056) indicate that this site is not necessary for rapid disease progression."
6774,0.006,6.0,"Occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) is highly prevalent worldwide. In some cases, it is a consequence of infection with variant viruses mutated in the S gene and producing a surface antigen not recognized by diagnostic kits. In most cases, OBI is due to a strong inhibition of hepatitis B virus (HBV) activities exerted by host defense mechanisms. OBI may reactivate in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy with the possibility of a consequent development of acute hepatitis that may lead to hepatic failure. Hematological malignancies and therapeutic schedules including rituximab are the conditions most frequently associated with OBI reactivation. However, this event may occur in a large number of additional clinical and therapeutic settings. Identification of patients prone to undergo reactivation is of great importance for promptly starting a proper antiviral therapy that may stop the HBV reactivation and prevent its clinical sequelae."
4158,0.006,6.0,"Previous studies have implicated CXCL12 in the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection. Proteolysis of CXCL12 generates a neurotoxic molecule, CXCL12(5-67), which engages and activates CXCR3, in addition to exhibiting increased expression in the brains of patients with HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Herein, we investigated CXCR3-mediated neuronal injury, particularly, its contribution to autophagy suppression and the concomitant effects of antiretroviral therapy using human brain samples and models of HIV neuropathogenesis. Neurons in the brains of HAD patients and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected animals, as well as cultured human neurons, expressed CXCR3, which was modulated in a ligand-specific manner. Exposure of human neurons to CXCL12(5-67) caused a reduction in the autophagy-associated molecule LC3 (P<0.05) and neuronal survival (P<0.05), which recapitulated findings in FIV- and HIV-infected brains (P<0.05). Oral didanosine (ddI) treatment of FIV-infected animals reduced neurobehavioral abnormalities in conjunction with diminished plasma viral load (P<0.05). F4/80 transcript abundance and CXCL12(5-67) immunoreactivity were reduced with restored neuronal LC3 expression in the brains of FIV-infected animals after ddI treatment (P<0.05). ddI treatment also prevented microglial activation and depletion of synaptic proteins in the cortex of FIV-infected animals (P<0.05). These findings indicate that the beneficial effects of ddI might be a consequence of a reduced systemic viral burden and concurrent leukocyte activation, leading to diminished neuroinflammation with preservation of neuronal autophagy by regulating CXCR3 activation."
7254,0.006,6.0,"The aim of this study was to assess the degree of implementation of national guidelines for isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and factors affecting the impact of the programme. Twenty-eight infectious disease hospital units in Italy participated in this observational, multicentre, prospective cohort study. A number of HIV-infected subjects, (n=1,705) seen for the first time as outpatients, were included in this analysis. Of the subjects considered, 1,215 out of the 1,705 completed purified protein derivative (PPD) screening. Variables independently associated with offering and completion of PPD screening included having acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), higher educational levels and currently receiving therapy. Overall, 103 subjects were identified as candidates for IPT. Of these subjects, five had tuberculosis and 15 had contraindications to IPT. Forty subjects agreed to start IPT, and 29 completed a full-course regimen. The incidence of tuberculosis among IPT candidates who either did not begin or discontinued IPT was 6.1 per 100 person-yrs, while no cases of tuberculosis were observed in subjects completing IPT. Several factors may limit the implementation of an isoniazid preventive therapy programme for human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons. Physicians fail to offer purified protein derivative screening to patients with high degrees of immunodeficiency, and those with a more intense workload seem to pay less attention to this test. The high number of contraindications among patients and their low level of acceptance further affects the impact of isoniazid preventive therapy."
6755,0.006,6.0,"The study aimed to clarify clinical significance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) rtA181S mutation in Chinese HBV-infected patients. A total of 18 419 patients with chronic HBV infection from Beijing 302 Hospital were investigated. HBV complete reverse transcriptase region of polymerase was screened by direct sequencing, and the results were verified by clonal sequencing. Replication-competent mutant and wild-type HBV genomic amplicons were constructed and transfected into the HepG2 cells and cultured in the presence or absence of serially diluted nucleos(t)ide analogues. Intracellular HBV replicative intermediates were quantitated for calculating the 50% effective concentration of the drug (EC(50)). The rtA181S was detected in 98 patients with 12 kinds of mutational patterns. Genotype C and genotype B HBV infection occupied 91.8% and 8.2% in rtA181S-positive patients, in contrast to 84.6% and 15.4% in rtA181S-negative patients (P < 0.01). All rtA181S-positive patients had received nucleos(t)ide analogues. rtA181S was detected in multiple patients with virologic breakthrough. Phenotypic analysis of patient-derived viral strains showed that rtA181S, rtA181S+N236T, rtN236T and rtA181V strains had 68.5%, 49.9%, 71.4% and 66.2% of natural replication capacity of wild-type strain, and 3.7-fold, 9.8-fold, 7.9-fold and 5.6-fold increased EC(50) to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV). The rtA181S strain remained susceptible to lamivudine, entecavir and tenofovir, and ADV susceptibility was restored after the mutation was eliminated through site-directed mutagenesis. Rescue therapy with entecavir or combination therapy was effective in rtA181S-related ADV-refractory patients. The rtA181S mutation confers moderate resistance to ADV. It could be induced by either lamivudine or ADV and contribute ADV treatment failure."
6240,0.006,6.0,"To evaluate exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV) in dental operators, we surveyed 297 students of the Dental School, University of Milano, and 526 dentists registered at the Italian Dental Association (A.M.D.I.) of Lombardia. Out of 297 students, 10.8% had one or more serologic markers of HBV infection; none was hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. No significant difference in seropositivity was detected among students in relation to sex, age, or possible risk factors investigated. Out of 526 practitioners, 2.3% were positive for HBsAg, and 37.3% were antibody positive. The seropositivity increased progressively with age and years of professional experience, reaching the highest proportion in dentists with 30 years or more of practice (79.3%). Of those who had suffered from clinical hepatitis during their curriculum, 81.1% were seropositive compared with 34.5% observed in dentists without a prior clinical history of viral hepatitis. The proportion of seropositive dentists did not vary significantly with a history of blood transfusion, size of their practice, presence or absence (or unawareness) of subjects at high risk for HBV infection among their patients. The seropositivity was significantly lower in dentists who routinely adopted mask and gloves (21.1%) compared with those who never and/or occasionally used such barriers (46.3%). The result of the study confirmed that hepatitis B does remain a significant hazard for dental professionals, hence immunization with hepatitis B vaccine should be delivered early in their employment."
5219,0.006,6.0,"Important progress has been made in recent years in the development and clinical use of drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Nevertheless, when antiretroviral therapy fails to be fully suppressive, new viral variants emerge, thus allowing HIV-1 to escape from drug pressure by accumulating mutations. Between 50% and 70% of treated patients with virological rebound harbour some form of drug-resistant virus; transmitted drug resistance in drug-naïve populations has reached 5-20% in areas of the world with access to treatment. The emergence of drug-resistant viruses remains the limiting factor in HIV-1 management, being a major cause of treatment failure, and being associated with clinical progression and death. All international guidelines focus on the importance of tailoring antiretroviral therapy to the individual patient, on the basis onf HIV-1 genetic data, integrated with clinical, laboratory and therapeutic information. The aim of this review is to provide useful information to clinicians and virologists about how and when to use genotypic resistance testing in clinical practice, especially in the management of the first stages of HIV-1 patient care and treatment decisions."
7968,0.006,6.0,"We experienced a 24-year-old Japanese man, who was a hepatitis B virus carrier with nephrotic syndrome. Liver biopsy showed that he was suffering from chronic hepatitis (activity 2, fibrosis 2). Renal biopsy revealed membranous nephropathy(MN) with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis(FGS). Immunofluorescentic findings revealed the presence of HBe antigen along the glomerular capillaries as well as HBe antigenemia in circulation. Therefore, we diagnosed this case as HB virus-related membranous nephropathy associated with FGS lesions. He was treated with interferon(IFN) alpha-2b for over a month and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. These therapies reduced urinary protein excretion from 4-6 g/day to 1-2 g/day, in accordance with a decrease in the titer of HBV DNA polymerase. The second renal biopsy revealed that the histological change from MN to membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis Type III after IFN therapy. These results suggest that IFN therapy might be effective for HB virus-related MN associated with FGS."
6514,0.006,6.0,"Alcohol-antiretroviral therapy (ART) interactive toxicity beliefs reflect perceived adverse outcomes of mixing alcohol and ART. Previous research has shown a significant relationship between alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs and ART non-adherence, over and above other correlates of non-adherence such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)symptoms and frequency of alcohol use. Most past studies have collected data over extended periods and have not determined if alcohol use and missed medications occur at the day-level among people holding interactive toxicity beliefs. Previous daily analyses, however, have been limited by self-reported adherence and relatively short periods of observation. To address these gaps in the literature, men and women living with HIV in Atlanta, GA, were enrolled in a 45-day observational cohort study. Daily alcohol use was collected using two-way interactive text message surveys and daily adherence was collected via the Wisepill device. Fifty-seven participants completed a measure of alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs and contributed 2565 days of daily data. Participants who endorsed high levels of interactive toxicity beliefs had significantly more days when they missed doses of medication. Alcohol-antiretroviral toxicity beliefs predicted missing doses of medication on days when participants were drinking and on days when they were not drinking. Multilevel multivariate regressions showed that these toxicity beliefs predicted daily missed doses of medication over and above quantity of alcohol consumed, depression and general medication concerns. This study replicates and extends previous literature and indicates the necessity of addressing alcohol-ART toxicity beliefs within adherence interventions."
6910,0.006,6.0,"HBeAg seropositivity is a marker for active viral replication. In the natural history of chronic hepatitis B infection, HBeAg marks the first two of the four phases, namely the immune tolerant phase and the immune clearance phase, and is associated with highly replicative activity of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Most HBV consensus reports and guidelines recommend antiviral therapy if the immune clearance phase is prolonged and if there is evidence of significant necroinflammation and fibrosis. Two main types of antiviral agents have been approved for treating patients in the immune clearance phase: interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs). The endpoints of therapy are viral suppression with HBeAg seroconversion, undetectable serum HBV DNA, normalization of serum alanine transaminase and improvement in the histological necroinflammatory and fibrosis scores. The ultimate goal of therapy is to obtain clinical benefit for the patient by reducing complications including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The choice between interferon-based immune modulators or NUCs that target the HBV DNA polymerase must be carefully weighed on an individual basis. Therapy with NUCs is often preferred by doctors and patients because it is easy to administer, with predictable efficacy and minimal side-effects. In specific patient subgroups such as those with decompensated disease, poor predictors of response or lack of response to interferon-based therapy and/or significant comorbidities that cannot tolerate interferon-induced side effects, NUCs therapy is the obvious choice. Entecavir and tenofovir are the treatments of choice because their efficacy and safety profile are better than lamivudine, adefovir and telbivudine. More importantly, there is a minimal risk of drug resistance during long-term therapy with these agents."
574,0.006,6.0,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy is essential to treatment success for individuals living with HIV/AIDS. Despite the wealth of studies in examining antiretroviral non-adherence, few have distinguished between intentional and unintentional non-adherence. The present study attempted to identify factors associated with adherence, intentional non-adherence, and unintentional non-adherence among HIV+ individuals using a longitudinal design. Dietary instructions and medication schedule were also included to measure the subtleties of antiretroviral adherence. One hundred and two HIV+ patients who were under antiretroviral therapy were recruited in an outpatient clinic in Hong Kong at baseline with six months follow-up. Using the conventional adherence rate, only 12 (11.8%) of participants reported having missed/ altered medication in the past four days. However, using a more comprehensive assessment, only 27 (26.5%) participants were classified as adherers. Results showed that, adherers were significantly older and had higher adherence self-efficacy than those who were unintentional or intentional non-adherers. Participants classified as unintentional non-adherers had longer length of diagnosis and started medication longer than adherers and intentional non-adherers. Participants classified as intentional non-adherers had worse mental health, higher level of self-stigma, and reported higher score in avoidant coping than adherers and unintentional non-adherers. They also scored higher in physical symptoms than adherers. Findings highlight the importance of a reliable, comprehensive measurement for adherence and extend on previous adherence literature that intentional and unintentional non-adherence are separate entities and are associated with different factors. Future research should understand the intentions behind non-adherence and this would serve as an important guide in the development of interventions aimed at improving antiretroviral adherence for HIV+ patients."
9507,0.006,6.0,"In Belgium, individual laboratory and treatment data of all HIV-infected patients seen in the 9 AIDS Reference Centres and 7 AIDS Reference Laboratories are collected prospectively since 2006. We present here an analysis of patients recorded in the cohort database between 1st of January 2006 and 31st of December 2008. During that period, 11982 patients were under medical follow-up in Belgium. Sixty-one percent of the patients were male and the median age was 39.8 at the time of first recorded viral load. Among the patients whose nationality or probable mode of transmission was recorded, nearly half (48.0%) were Belgian and 38.3% originated from Sub-Saharan Africa; heterosexual contacts were reported in the majority of cases (56.0%) followed by homosexual contacts (35.3%). A total of 145 deaths were reported. Around three quarters of the patients were on ART. The median CD4 cell count rose from 470 cells/mm3 in 2006 to 501 cells/mm3 in 2008. This cohort enabled us to obtain comprehensive information on the numbers and characteristics of HIV-infected patients currently being followed up in Belgium, and on trends in antiretroviral therapy and biological results. This will serve for planning purposes, evaluation of access to care and as a source of information for further studies."

3280,0.006,6.0,"Cryptosporidium spp. is a major cause of diarrhea in developing countries, mainly affecting people with compromised immune systems in general and HIV-infected individuals with low CD4 + T-cell counts in particular. This infection is self-limiting in healthy persons; however, it can be severe, progressive and persistent in those who are immunocompromised. There are few published studies concerning cryptosporidiosis and Cryptosporidium genotypes in Iranian immunocompromised patients and none of them describe risk factors. This study was undertaken to identify prevalence, genotypes and risk factors for cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised patients. Three fecal samples were obtained at two day intervals from each of the 183 patients and processed with modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining methods and 18S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. The overall infection prevalence was 6%. Cryptosporidium parvum was identified in isolates from five HIV-infected patients, one patient who had undergone bone marrow transplantation and one with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cryptosporidium hominis was identified in isolates from two HIV-infected patients and two patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. According to univariate analysis, the statistically significant factors were diarrhea (OR = 21.7, CI = 2.83-78.4, P= 0.003), CD4 + lymphocytes less than 100 cells/mm(3) (OR = 41.3, CI = 13.45-114.8, P < 0.0001), other microbial infections (OR = 7.1321.7, CI = 1.97-25.73, P = 0.006), weight loss (OR = 73.78, CI = 15.5-350, P < 0.0001), abdominal pain (OR = 10.29, CI = 2.81-37.74.4, P= 0.001), dehydration (OR = 72.1, CI = 17.6-341.5, P < 0.0001), vomiting (OR = 4.87, CI = 1.4-16.9, P= 0.015), nausea (OR = 9.4, CI = 2.38-37.2, P < 0.001), highly active antiretroviral therapy (OR = 0.089, CI = 0.01-0.8, P= 0.015) and diarrhea in household members (OR = 7.37, CI = 2.04-26.66, P= 0.001). After multivariate analysis and a backward deletion process, only < 100 CD4 + T-lymphocytes/mm(3) maintained a significant association with infection.

6075,0.006,6.0,"This study assessed cognitive and affective predictors of intention to obtain vaccination against the hepatitis B virus (HBV) among men who have sex with men (MSM), based on leading social cognitive models of health behavior. The key predictors of vaccination intention were perceived risk of contracting HBV, expectancies regarding the outcome of vaccination, and the interaction between risk perception and outcome expectancies. Negative affect increased risk perceptions, which, in turn, positively affected vaccination intention. It is concluded that MSM should feel they are at risk for HBV, and see solutions to this risk."
432,0.006,6.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients with liver failure have a poor prognosis, and no satisfactory biomarkers are available for diagnosis before the end-stage. We explored serum peptide profiling for diagnosis and prediction of progression to liver failure in HBV-infected patients. Serum samples (164) from healthy subjects (n = 20), or subjects with chronic hepatitis B without cirrhosis and liver failure [chronic hepatitis B subjects without cirrhosis and liver failure (CHB); n = 33], with compensated liver cirrhosis (compensated liver cirrhosis (LC); n = 35), with acute-on-chronic liver failure [acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF); n = 38] or with chronic liver failure [chronic liver failure (CLF), n = 38] were applied to ClinProt magnetic beads, and bound peptides/proteins were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Our classification diagnostic models of liver disease were generated based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Quick Classifier Algorithm (QC). Differentially expressed peptides were found among all test groups, with patterns of difference that readily distinguished between healthy and various HBV-associated liver disease samples. The model generated seven characteristic peptide peaks at 4053 m/z, 3506 m/z, 4963 m/z, 9289 m/z, 2628 m/z, 3193 m/z and 6432 m/z, giving overall predictive capability of 54.27%. Two-way comparisons of LC, ACLF or CLF vs CHB had predictive capabilities of 79.8%, 91.41% and 97.99%, respectively. Comparisons of ACLF or CLF vs LC were predictive at 87.72% and 82.18%, respectively and ACLF vs CLF was predictive at 75.05%. These classification diagnostic models generated by different peptide peaks were further validated in blinded tests with 67-100% accuracy. Serum peptide patterns vary during progression of chronic HBV infection to liver failure and may be used to distinguish different stages of the disease."
801,0.006,6.0,"Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is recognised as an important component of collaborative tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activities to reduce the burden of TB in people living with HIV (PLHIV). However, there has been little in the way of IPT implementation at country level. This failure has resulted in a recent call to arms under the banner title of the 'Three I's' (infection control to prevent nosocomial transmission of TB in health care settings, intensified TB case finding and IPT). In this paper, we review the background of IPT. We then discuss the important challenges of IPT in PLHIV, namely responsibility and accountability for the implementation, identification of latent TB infection, exclusion of active TB and prevention of isoniazid resistance, length of treatment and duration of protective efficacy. We also highlight several research questions that currently remain unanswered. We finally offer practical suggestions about how to scale up IPT in the field, including the need to integrate IPT into a package of care for PLHIV, the setting up of operational projects with the philosophy of 'learning while doing', the development of flow charts for eligibility for IPT, the development and implementation of care prior to antiretroviral treatment, and finally issues around procurement, distribution, monitoring and evaluation. We support the implementation of IPT, but only if it is done in a safe and structured way. There is a definite risk that 'sloppy' IPT will be inefficient and, worse, could lead to the development of multidrug-resistant TB, and this must be avoided at all costs."

5316,0.006,6.0,"The prognosis of decompensated cirrhosis of liver resulting from chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection is poor and liver transplantation is the only established mode of treatment. The benefits of treatment with interferon are outweighed by serious side effects and risks of fatal exacerbation of disease activity. Lamivudine rapidly reduces hepatitis B viral DNA in serum to undetectable levels. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effectiveness and safety of Lamivudine treatment in patients with advanced and end stage liver disease caused by Hepatitis B. This was a prospective observational study in which a total of 45 patients, 39 (87.0%) male and 6 (13.0%) female who had viral activity and child pugh score e"" 8 were given Lamivudine 100 mg orally once daily. Among them 30 patients completed at least 6 months of therapy, majority (27 patients) showed improvement in liver function with decrease in serum ALT from mean (+/- SD) 118.8 +/- 106.5 to 50.2 +/- 57.1 U/L (p < 0.001), decrease in serum bilirubin from 73.9 +/- 80.5 to 44.7 +/- 62.9 micromol/l (p = 0.129), increase in serum albumin from 26.2 +/- 4.2 to 33.2 +/- 3.4 g/l (p < 0.05), decrease in prothrombin time from 8.3 +/- 4.0 to 3.9 +/- 2.9 seconds prolonged (p < 0.05) and reduction in child pugh score from 11.0 +/- 1.7 to 7.0 +/- 1.3 (p < 0.001). Seroconversion was found in 5 (11.1%) patients on Intention to treat analysis. Among the seroconverted group, 1 (2.2%) patient also lost HBsAg. Six (13.0%) patient had procore mutant virus, 2 (4.4%) of them showed virological response. Therefore, total 7 (15.5%) patients showed virological response by intention to treat analysis. We conclude that inhibition of viral replication with Lamivudine results in a significant improvement of liver function in patients with decompensated cirrhosis of liver due to HBV infection."
5673,0.006,6.0,"Initiation of efavirenz-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is associated with Vitamin D deficiency, but the risk factors including efavirenz pharmacokinetics for cART-induced severe vitamin D deficiency (SVDD) and the impact of anti-tuberculosis (TB) cotreatment are not explored. We investigated the prevalence of SVDD in HIV and TB-HIV coinfected patients and associated risk factors for treatment-induced SVDD.Treatment-naïve Ethiopian HIV patients with (n = 102) or without (n = 89) TB co-infection were enrolled prospectively and received efavirenz-based cART. In TB-HIV coinfected patients, rifampicin-based anti-TB treatment was initiated 4 or 8 weeks before starting cART. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D), cholesterol and 4-beta hydroxycholesterol concentrations were measured at baseline, 4, 16, and 48 week of cART. Plasma efavirenz concentrations were determined at 4 and 16 weeks of cART.TB-HIV patients had significantly lower plasma 25 (OH)D3 levels than HIV-only patients at baseline. TB co-infection, low Karnofsky score, high viral load, and high CYP3A activity as measured by plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratios were significant predictors of low 25 (OH)D3 levels at baseline. In HIV-only patients, initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVVD from 27% at baseline to 76%, 79%, and 43% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively. The median 25 (OH)D3 levels declined from baseline by -40%, -50%, and -14% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively.In TB-HIV patients, previous anti-TB therapy had no influence on 25 (OH)D3 levels, but the initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVDD from 57% at baseline to 70% and 72% at the 4 and 16 weeks of cART, respectively. Median plasma 25 (OH)D3 declined from baseline by -17% and -21% at week 4 and 16 of cART, respectively.Our results indicate low plasma cholesterol, high CYP3A activity, and high plasma efavirenz concentrations as significant predictors of early efavirenz-based cART-induced vitamin D deficiency. Low plasma 25 (OH)D3 level at baseline is associated with TB co-infection and HIV diseases progression. Initiation of efavirenz-based cART is associated with high incidence of SVDD, whereas rifampicin based anti-TB therapy co-treatment has no significant effect. Supplementary vitamin D during cART initiation may be beneficial for HIV patients regardless of TB coinfection. "
4573,0.006,6.0,"Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) used for the treatment of HIV-1 inhibit the replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which may contribute to severe mitochondrial toxicity including lipodystrophy, through the inhibition of polymerase gamma (POLG). Polymorphisms of POLG could explain the variation in mitochondrial toxicity in HIV-1-infected patients. We explored the relationship between selected polymorphisms of POLG and lipodystrophy related to NRTIs. We studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at three amino acid residues (R1142, E1143 and R1146) and the CAG repeats of POLG in a case-control study including HIV-1 treated patients with lipodystrophy (n=69) and 2 controls (without lipodystrophy) per case matched by age, race and sex (n=138). Compared with matched controls, the polymorphisms in E1143 were significantly more frequent in case patients with lipodystrophy (aOR=4.7; p=0.048), and this was associated with a significant decrease of mtDNA in PBMC. In addition, among the parameters tested, the conditional logistic regression showed that the lipodystrophy has a strong link with E1143 polymorphisms, associated with D4T treatment (aOR=9.29, p=0.002). In conclusion, patients harbouring the changes of E1143 in the catalytic site of POLG exhibit a 4-fold increased risk to develop lipodystrophy than HIV-1 treated patients who do not have changes in E1143 and this risk can increase if the patient presenting the SNP received D4T. These could be due to decreased content of mtDNA in PBMC in these patients. Therefore, the toxicity of NRTIs leading to lipodystrophy in some HIV-1 infected patients could be explained in part by the occurrence of POLG polymorphisms."
9447,0.006,6.0,"Enteroparasites are related to gastrointestinal alterations among patients with HIV/AIDS, some causing severe manifestations in the period before the institution of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The prevalence of enteroparasitoses in patients with HIV/AIDS seen at two hospitals in Ceará , Brazil, was compared in the pre-HAART (Group 1; n = 482) and HAART (Group 2; n = 100) eras. Fecal parasitologic examinations (FPE) were performed using the direct, Lutz, Baermann-Moraes and modified Ziehl-Neelsen methods. The following parasites were detected in Groups 1 and 2, respectively: Strongyloides stercoralis--30.1% and 11% (p<0.0001), Ascaris lumbricoides--15.6% and 2% (p<0.0001), hookworms--3.7% and 2% (p<0.0001), Trichuris trichiura--13.1% and 1% (p<0.0001), Hymenolepis nana--0 and 1% (p = 0.1718), Giardia duodenalis--7.9% and 1% (p = 0.0076), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar--3.3% and 1% (p = 0.3301), Isospora belli--4.8% and 1% (p = 0.0993), Cryptosporidium sp.--8.1% and 0 (p = 0.0007), and non-pathogenic protozoans as well. There was a significant reduction in the prevalence of enteroparasites between the eras (63.9% to 24%; p<0.0001). In the HAART era, the following observations were made: greater frequency of enteroparasites in patients without antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.0575), as in those with AIDS (p = 0.08), and diarrhea (36% of the patients); lack of association with positive FPE (p = 0.626); and non-detection of Cryptosporidium sp. Strongyloides stercoralis showed an elevated prevalence in the two eras and was more frequent in men (32.41%) than women (19.04%) of Group 1 (p = 0.018), a finding suggesting the transmission of the helminth through sodomy. The advent of the HAART modified the profile of opportunistic infections, including parasites, probably due to the reconstitution of cellular immunity and the direct action of HAART on the parasites."
215,0.005,5.0,"We examined the rates of variant population turnover of the V1-V2 and V4-V5 hypervariable domains of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 molecule in longitudinal plasma samples from 14 men with chronic HIV-1 infection using heteroduplex tracking assays (HTA). Six men had high rates of CD4+ T-cell loss, and eight men had low rates of CD4+ T-cell loss over 2.5 to 8 years of infection. We found that V1-V2 and V4-V5 env populations changed dramatically over time in all 14 subjects; the changes in these regions were significantly correlated with each another over time. The subjects with rapid CD4 loss had significantly less change in their env populations than the subjects with slow CD4 loss. The two subjects with rapid CD4 loss and sustained low CD4 counts (<150/microl for at least 2 years) showed stabilization of their V1-V2 and V4-V5 populations as reflected by low levels of total change in HTA pattern and low HTA indices (a novel measure of the emergence of new bands and band distribution); this stabilization was not observed in other subjects. The stabilization of env variant populations at low CD4 counts following periods of rapid viral evolution suggests that selective pressure on env, likely from new immune responses, is minimal when CD4 counts drop dramatically and remain low for extended periods of time."
2175,0.005,5.0,"In India, HSV seroprevalence and its coinfection with HIV among female patients with reproductive tract infections (RTI) are sparse. We aim to ascertain the seroprevalence of HSV and its coinfection with HIV and common sexually transmitted infections attending Obstetrics and Gynaecology outpatient department, RIMS. The study included 92 female patients with RTI. Diagnostic serology was done for HSV-1 and HSV-2 using group specific IgM indirect immunoassay using ELISA, HIV by 3 ELISA/Rapid/Simple (E/R/S) test of different biological antigen. Diagnosis of RTI was made on clinical grounds with appropriate laboratory investigations--microscopy, Gram stain smear etc. Bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed using Nugent's criteria, Syphilis by rapid plasma reagin (RPR) card test and Chlamydia trachomatis by IgG ELISA. Out of 92 sera tested for HSV, 18 (19.6%) were IgM HSV positive and 9 (9.8%) were HIV positive. Co-infection rate of HSV in HIV positive was 16.7%. None of the patients had clinical herpes genitalis, all were subclinical cases. 55.5% of HSV positives belongs to age group 21 to 30 years. Of the HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgM positives 3 (15%) had HIV, 4 (22.2%) bacterial vaginosis, 2 (11.1%) were RPR positive, 4 (22.2%) Chlamydia trachomatis, 3 (15%) were pregnant. 16 (88.8%) were unemployed, 14 (77.7%) had education level below 10 standard. Our study suggest that every case of RTI, be it an ulcerative or nonulcerative must be thoroughly evaluated by laboratory testing for primary subclinical genital HSV coinfection as this has profound implications on their judicious management and aversion of complications. Early diagnosis and treatment of HSV infection together with prophylaxis for recurrent HSV disease will prevent progression and spread of HIV disease."
6319,0.005,5.0,"Hepatocellular injury in hepatitis B virus infection may be produced by an autoaggressive hepatocytotoxic immune response. To test the hypothesis that acquired suppressor cell defects may participate in such a response, we assessed the functional integrity of 2 suppressor cell populations in patients with type B viral hepatitis. Spontaneous suppression of the 1-way mixed lymphocyte response by radiation-resistant, adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells decreases during the acute phase of disease, returns towards normal with clinical recovery, but remains depressed in patients with chronic hepatitis. The degree of spontaneous suppressor cell dysfunction correlates inversely with at least 1 biochemical parameter of hepatocellular injury (SGPT). The functional integrity of this suppressor cell fluctuates during chronic hepatitis and may reflect currently undefined biologic variables in this disease. Mitogen-induced suppression on lymphocyte activation by radiation resistant, nonadherent suppressor cells is also depressed in acute and chronic hepatitis, but it does not correlate with biochemical evidence of hepatocellular injury on an individual-patient basis. Documentation of these generalized defects of nonspecific suppressor cell function establishes a basis for the possible existence of specific anomalies of immuno-regulation that may permit the expression of normally suppressed auoaggressive hepatocytotoxic immune mechanisms in viral hepatitis."
8216,0.005,5.0,"The immigrant population in Spain, whether legal or not, has been entitled to healthcare under the same conditions as the Spanish population since the year 2000. The entry into vigour of the Royal Decree-Law 12/2012 of 20 April has significantly restricted this right, so that unauthorized or non-resident foreigners may now only receive emergency care, if they are under 18 or pregnant women. Out of an estimated 459,909 illegal immigrants in our country, 2,700 to 4,600 are probably infected with HIV; 1,800 to 3,220 know that they are infected, and 80% of the latter could receive antiretroviral treatment. The Royal Decree-Law is likely to cause many undesirable consequences in this population infected with HIV: increasing mortality, promoting the emergence of opportunistic diseases, increasing hospital admissions, increasing infections in the population (by HIV and other pathogens), or contributing to mother to child transmission of HIV. The expected increase in morbidity and mortality will be a greater cost in patient care, a cost which will be significantly higher in the more immunosuppressed patients. Therefore, the enforcement of the Royal Decree-Law will be much less cost-effective in the short term than was expected, and will negatively affect our country's public health, especially for those patients infected with HIV who will not be covered, thus increasing healthcare medium to long term costs, and moving away from the international health goals that were established."

Socio-demographics, substance use and clinical correlates of antiretroviral therapy non-adherence were studied in 100 HIV-1 infected drug users receiving antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months in Hanoi, Vietnam. All study participants were men with a mean age of 29.9 ± 4.9 years. The median duration on antiretroviral therapy was 16.2 ± 12.7 months; 83% reported 'very good' or 'perfect' adherence in the past 30 days on a subjective one-item Likert scale at time of study enrollment; 48% of participants reported drug use within the previous 6 months, with 22% reporting current drug use. Injection drug use with or without non-injection drug use in the past 6 months (95% C.I. 2.19, 1.30-3.69) and years on antiretroviral therapy (95% C.I. 1.43, 1.14-1.78) were correlated with suboptimal adherence. These findings support Vietnam's ongoing scale-up of harm reduction programmes for injection drug users and their integration with antiretroviral therapy delivery. Moreover, results highlight the need to identify and implement new ways to support high levels of antiretroviral therapy adherence as duration on antiretroviral therapy increases. "
80,0.005,5.0,"We estimated prevalence and incidence of liver condition outcomes, and costs to the health service of diagnosed hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Tayside, UK. HBV patients were identified from electronic virology data between 1989 and 2003. The health resource costs of HBV for surface antigen-positive (HBsAg+) patients and HBV (HBsAg+ or immune, i.e. recovered) patients were calculated. A total of 633 patients had HBV (275 HBsAg+), and were more likely to be male (62% vs. 48%), older (mean age 42.6 vs. 39 . 2 years) and deprived than the general population. The prevalence of immune individuals increased steadily. Post-HBV diagnosis, 24% of immune and 13% of HBsAg+ patients were diagnosed with a liver condition. The median cost per immune patient (£3023) was greater than per HBsAg+ patient (£1498) (P=0.02). While increasing prevalence of immune HBV patients highlights an increase in screening and treatment, the costs associated with this group are high."
158,0.005,5.0,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) became more widely available in the Russian Federation in 2006 when the Global Fund made a contribution to purchase ART with a mandate to increase numbers of patients receiving it. Funds were distributed to AIDS Centers and selected hospitals, and numbers quickly increased. Though ART is highly effective for adherent patients, dropout has been a problem; thus understanding characteristics of patients who remain on ART vs. those who leave treatment may provide information to facilitate engagement. We retrospectively assessed depression, hopelessness, substance use, viral load, and CD4+ counts of 120 patients who dropped out of ART for ≥12 months (Lost-to-Care, LTCs) and 120 who continued for ≥12 months (Engaged-in-Care, EICs). As expected, LTCs had higher viral loads and depression, lower CD4+ counts, more alcohol, heroin, and injection drug use in the past 30 days. A binary logistic regression with Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression score, Beck Hopelessness score, whether drugs/alcohol had ever prevented them from taking ART, and past 30 days' alcohol use [χ(2)(4) = 64.27, p = .0.000] correctly classified 74.5% of participants as LTC or EIC, suggesting that integrated treatment for substance use, psychiatric, and HIV could reduce dropout and improve outcomes."
7009,0.005,5.0,"IgM, IgG, and HBsAg containing circulating immune complexes (CIC) were determined, by conglutinin (K) and C1q assays, for assessing the role of CIC in hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in 54 HBsAg-negative controls and 85 HBsAg-positive patients with chronic hepatitis. The prevalence of HDV markers (HDV antigen and anti-HD) was 24.70% (21/85). CIC were a common feature of HDV infection with 95.24% of patients having at least one abnormal test result. The prevalence of elevated IgM-K, IgG-K, IgM-C1q, and IgG-C1q CIC were 85.71, 85.71, 57.14, and 85.71%, respectively. The prevalence of IgM class CIC were statistically higher in patients with HDV infection than in those without (P = .001 for the K assay and P = .023 for the C1q assay). There was no difference in the prevalence of IgG class CIC. Patients with HDV infection also have significantly higher median levels of IgM K-CIC (P = .002), IgG K-CIC (P = .049), and IgG C1q-CIC (P = .008). In patients with HDV infection, there was positive correlation between IgM C1q-CIC and transaminase levels (r = .519, P = .016 for AST; r = .500, P = .021 for ALT). There was no difference in the prevalence of HBsAg containing CIC between patients with HDV infection (76.19%) and those without (74.60%). In conclusion, IgM class CIC are the major CIC and correlate with disease activity in HDV infection. CIC may play a role in the pathogenesis of HDV infection."
531,0.005,5.0,"The authors reviewed the medical records of 194 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients newly diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis and all 3,564 patients with newly diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) at San Francisco General Hospital for the period 1986-1992. The study was designed to address three questions: 1) How do AIDS patients who present with cryptosporidiosis differ from other patients with AIDS? 2) What factors are associated with survival among AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis? 3) Does a diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis impact survival after AIDS diagnosis? A total of 194 cases of cryptosporidiosis among HIV-infected patients were identified during the study period. Of the 194 patients, 109 (56%) had no prior diagnosis of AIDS. These 109 patients represented 3.1% of the 3,564 newly diagnosed cases of AIDS in the same period. Among the 134 patients with CD4 T-lymphocyte counts performed within 3 months of Cryptosporidium diagnosis, 34 (25%) had CD4 counts greater than 209 cells/ml. In a multivariate conditional logistic regression model, the incidence of Cryptosporidium was related to ethnicity (for blacks vs. whites, matched odds ratio (OR) = 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.73), CD4 count (for a CD4 count of < or = 53 cells/ml vs. > 53 cells/ml, matched OR = 12.60, 95% CI 4.01-39.61), and age (for a 10-year increase, matched OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.98). Two factors measured at the time of Cryptosporidium diagnosis were identified as being independently associated with survival (p < 0.001) in the proportional hazards model: CD4 count < or = 53 cells/ml versus > 53 cells/ml (relative hazard = 6.18, 95% CI 2.99-12.76) and hematocrit < or 37% versus > 37% (relative hazard = 2.27, 95% CI 1.22-4.22). The median durations of survival in the four subgroups of Cryptosporidium-infected patients defined by these two variables differed significantly from each other (range, 204-1,119 days). Cryptosporidiosis as an initial AIDS-defining diagnosis was associated with an elevated relative hazard of death in comparison with other AIDS-defining diagnoses (relative hazard = 2.01, 95% CI 1.38-2.93). These data identify the groups of HIV-infected individuals at risk for presentation with symptomatic Cryptosporidium infection; the distinct survival patterns among subgroups of those patients already infected with this parasite; and the survival of AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis relative to patients with other AIDS-defining conditions. Such information is necessary for the design of prospective studies, the development of prophylactic strategies, the evaluation of candidate therapies, and the provision of prognostic information to patients."
1182,0.005,5.0,"Lifelong ART is essential to reducing HIV mortality and ending the epidemic, however the interplay between socioeconomic position and long-term outcomes of HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown. Furthering the understanding of factors related to long-term ART outcomes in this important region will aid the successful scale-up of ART programs. We enrolled 559 HIV-infected Ugandan adults starting ART in 2004-2005 at the Infectious Diseases Institute in Kampala, Uganda and followed them for 10 years. We documented baseline employment status, regular household income, education level, housing description, physical ability, and CD4 count. Viral load was measured every six months. Proportional hazard regression tested for associations between baseline characteristics and 1) mortality, 2) virologic failure, and 3) mortality or virologic failure as a composite outcome. Over ten years 23% (n = 127) of participants died, 6% (n = 31) were lost-to-follow-up and 23% (107/472) experienced virologic treatment failure. In Kaplan-Meier analysis we observed an association between employment and mortality, with the highest cumulative probability of death occurring in unemployed individuals. In univariate analysis unemployment and disease severity were associated with mortality, but in multivariable analysis the only association with mortality was disease severity. We observed an association between higher household income and an increased incidence of both virologic failure and the combined outcome, and an association between self-employment and lower incidence of virologic failure and the combined outcome when compared to unemployment. Formal education level and housing status were unrelated to outcomes. It is feasible to achieve good ten-year survival, retention-in-care, and viral suppression in a socioeconomically diverse population in a resource-limited setting. Unemployment appears to be related to adverse 10-year ART outcomes. A low level of formal education does not appear to be a barrier to successful long-term ART."
3379,0.005,5.0,"Antiretroviral treatment nonadherence is complex, implicating more than a patient's ability and motivation to be compliant. The bulk of the research to date focuses on individual level barriers with less emphasis on the many system level factors that potentially impact patients' adherence behaviors. This study examined the effects of system enabling factors in addition to the frequently studied individual predisposing and enabling factors upon nonadherence to treatment. One hundred eighty-two patients from five community-based clinics were interviewed and their medical charts examined. Patients' self-reported nonadherence was correlated with clinicians' assessments of medication and appointment nonadherence. Seven individual predisposing factors (gender, ethnicity, birthplace, years of education, HIV Overview of Problems-Evaluation System [HOPES] psychosocial, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] anxiety, and HADS depression scores) were found to be significantly associated with treatment adherence/nonadherence. Individual enabling factors (hopefulness and access to health care), as well as treatment by clinic staff, a system enabling factor, were significantly associated with adherence/nonadherence. In a multivariate analysis, six factors - age (younger), gender (female), birth outside the United States, level of hopefulness (lower), access to health care (lower), and treatment by clinic staff (poorer) - accounted for 19.3% of the variance in nonadherence. Results of this study indicated that several individual predisposing and enabling factors were potential predictors of treatment nonadherence; however, system enabling factors, e.g., treatment by clinic staff were also associated with treatment nonadherence. Further studies are needed to examine the complex relationships of individual and system related factors in predicting treatment nonadherence."
8468,0.005,5.0,"Recently, a new hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutant with HBe antigen-negative phenotype has been characterized, in which one TATA box-like motif of the precore/core promoter had degenerated: most frequently by both A-->T and G-->A mutations at positions 1762 and 1764, respectively. The clinical significance of this mutant is as yet unknown. In our present study, the T1762 A1764 mutant was sought in sera from HBV-infected blood donors and chronic liver disease patients by directly sequencing a PCR-amplified region of HBVDNA. Also, because the A1764 mutation generates a Sau3AI cleavage site (GGTC-->GATC), we digested the PCR products with Sau3AI to see if cleavage would occur at this specific site. Our results mostly corroborated the earlier report but we found a higher-than-predicted frequency of HBe antigen-positive blood donors positive for the mutant (22%). The titres of HBe antigen in these mutant-positive sera were slightly decreased compared to the titres in wild-type HBV infection. In addition, these blood donors had relatively high (though within the normal range) serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, suggesting that the T1762 A1764 mutation could be used as a sensitive laboratory marker for insidious hepatitis in these otherwise 'asymptomatic' carriers. The Sau3AI assay, which is much more convenient than sequencing, was shown to be useful for the detection of the T1762 A1764 mutant in an extensive number of clinical samples."
7777,0.005,5.0,"CCR5 is an important chemokine receptor involved in the recruitment of specific anti-viral immune cells (e.g., NK cells and T cytotoxic cells) to the liver. Previous studies indicated that the Δ 32 mutation in CCR5 gene led to inactivation of CCR5. Several conflicting studies have suggested that this mutation may be associated with either recovery or persistence of HBV infection. The main purpose of this study was to compare the frequency of the Δ 32 mutation within the CCR5 gene in a group of patients infected chronically with HBV with healthy individuals from South-East of Iran. Sixty patients with chronic HBV infection as well as 300 age-, and sex-match healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Gap-PCR was applied to determine the frequency of CCR5 Δ 32 mutation in both groups. The results demonstrated that none of the patients infected with HBV carried the CCR5 Δ 32 mutation while, 3 (1%) of the healthy individuals were found to be heterozygotic for this mutation. The CCR5 Δ 32 mutation is not a prevalent mutation in either the patients infected chronically with HBV or their health counterparts in the South-East region of Iran. This may be attributed to either different genetic settings of the investigated population or lack of any significant correlation between this mutation and HBV pathogenicity."
3144,0.005,5.0,"The prisoner population of the penitentiaries presents an elevated prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) infection markers. In the last few years different measures have been developed to prevent infection. This study evaluates whether there have been changes in the prevalence of infection by these virus over the last few years within a penitentiary. A group of prisoners (n = 163) studied in 1985 were therefore compared with another group (n = 750) studied in 1992. Demographic, social, risk and penitentiary factors were included. In each of the subjects studied alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hepatitis B virus (HBsAG, antiHBs and antiHBc) and anti-HIV-1 markers were determined. It was globally observed that following the 7 years between the two studies there was a decrease in the prevalence of HBV (X = 14.63, p = 0.0001, OR = 2; CI 95%: 1.38-2.9), which was mainly observed in the group of prisoners with no drug addiction habits. No differences were observed with regard to the prevalence of anti-HIV-1 which remained similar among the IV drug consumers and not consumers (64% and 66.6% in 1985 and 1992, respectively). In conclusion, from 1985 to 1992 a decrease has been observed in the prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in the penitentiary population while the prevalence of anti-HIV-1 has remained unchanged."
3774,0.005,5.0,"Many hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected individuals do not have any obvious risk factors and one of the putative sources of infection may be inadvertent exposure to infected blood or body fluids in the clinical setting. The aim of this study was to assess the role of medical procedures in transmission of hepatitis C in north-eastern Poland. In total, 194 patients with chronic hepatitis C were eligible for the study. The control group consisted of 275 age- and sex-matched individuals. Patients with a history of intravenous drug use were excluded. On multivariate analysis, transfusions [odds ratio (OR) = 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-6.3], minor surgery (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.5-6.7) and dental care (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.4-4.0) were independently associated with HCV infection. We conclude that apart from transfusion, minor medical procedures and dental care may carry a significant risk of hepatitis C infection. Improvements in basic hygiene routines and strict adherence to universal precautions may be essential to prevent iatrogenic transmission of the infection."
7497,0.005,5.0,"To estimate the prevalence and identify factors associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among men and women in Karachi, Pakistan. We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult men and women in a peri-urban community of Karachi (Jam Kandah). Households were selected through systematic sampling from within all villages in the study area. All available adults within each household were interviewed about potential HCV risk factors. A blood specimen was collected to test for anti-HCV antibodies by enzyme immunoassay. We used generalized estimating equations while accounting for correlation of responses within villages to identify the factors associated with HCV infection. Of 1997 participants, 476 (23.8%) were anti-HCV positive. Overall, HCV infection was significantly associated with increasing age, ethnicity, and having received > or =2 blood transfusions, > or =3 hospitalizations, dental treatment and >5 injections among women. Among women, > or =2 blood transfusions [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.32], >5 injections during the past 6 months (aORs = 1.47), dental treatment (aOR = 1.31) and increasing age(aOR = 1.49), while among men, extramarital sexual intercourse (aOR = 2.77), at least once a week shave from barber (aOR = 5.04), > or =3 hospitalizations (aOR = 2.50) and increasing age (aOR = 1.28) were associated with HCV infection. A very high prevalence of HCV was found in the study population. Among women, unsafe health care practices, while among men extramarital sex, shaving from a barber and hospitalizations were associated with HCV infection. Efforts are needed to improve the safety of medical procedures to reduce the transmission of HCV in Pakistan [Corrections made in Summary after initial online publication.]."
5760,0.005,5.0,"Several of the common viral agents that can cause hepatitis have been detected in body fluids, including saliva and blood, which may both form important routes for transmission of disease. The viruses most commonly implicated include hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus. Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) can be found in persons positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and presumably follows the same routes of transmission as HBV. Herpes simplex and echo viruses can cause hepatitis on rare occasion. Other agents, not yet positively identified but collectively referred to as non-A, non-B are also believed to follow the same routes as HBV and/or HAV. The aim of this reviews is twofold. First, we will discuss hepatotropic viruses other than HBV that may be spread via saliva and blood and, therefore, should be considered along with HBV as a potential health hazard to dental personnel and also to dental patients. The second aim is to highlight the epidemiology and the risk of transmission of these viral infections. The potential hazards are discussed in relation to those associated with HBV and human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), implicated in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)."
4394,0.005,5.0,"Serological detection of isolated anti-hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) can occur in various scenarios, but the most clinically relevant situation is occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and clinical relevance of isolated anti-HBc and of OBI with isolated anti-HBc from an unselected hospital population. A total of 14,253 patients referred for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)/anti-HBs testing were classified into either the Health Promotion Center (HPC) group or the patient group. For patients who were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, an anti-HBc test was additionally performed. An HBV DNA real-time PCR test was performed on isolated anti-HBc patients, and their demographic and clinical data were reviewed. The measured prevalence of isolated anti-HBc and OBI in isolated anti-HBc patients was 5.9 % and 4.7 %, respectively. Prevalence was higher in males, elderly people, and the patient group than in females, the younger, and the HPC group, respectively. In most cases, the levels of HBV DNA load were very low (less than 200 IU/mL), and most cases of OBI presented without liver disease or history of HBV infection. The prevalence of isolated anti-HBc and OBI are affected by the methods of detection, subject population, and constituent factors such as sex and age. Although detection of HBV DNA does not always indicate infectivity, highly sensitive standardized HBV DNA tests are needed in clinical settings to exclude the possibility of OBI, especially in the advanced age group."
2200,0.005,5.0,"Progression of HIV/AIDS is frequently associated with frontal/subcortical dysfunction and mean reaction time (RT) slowing. Beyond group means, within-subject variability of RT has been found to be particularly sensitive to frontal/subcortical dysfunction in other populations. However, the possible relevance of RT variability to HIV/AIDS patients remains unknown. This study evaluated the relationships between RT variability and indicators such as neurocognitive, behavioral, and immunological status. A total of 46 HIV-positive adults on antiretroviral medication regimens were included in this study. Overall performance of this sample was poorer than normative means on measures of RT latency, RT variability, and traditional neurocognitive domains. Results demonstrated that the measures of RT variability were associated with global cognition, medication adherence rates, and peak immunological dysfunction, above and beyond the effects of RT latency. These preliminary findings suggest that measures of RT variability may provide enhanced sensitivity to neurocognitive disease burden in HIV/AIDS relative to more traditional measures of mean RT or cognitive function."

This study analyses the relationship between sexual behaviors among MDQ positive and MDQ negative patients and its influence in HIV infection, and the impact of HIV diagnosis in both groups. Two hundred outpatients from a specialized clinic for HIV-care located in Walter Cantídio's University Hospital in Fortaleza, Brazil answered to a demographic questionnaire, the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and a sexual behavior questionnaire based on WHO's Behavioral Surveillance Surveys (BSS). Fifteen percent (N=30) of all HIV positive patients were MDQ+. The MDQ+ group was more likely to: be or have been married, have offspring, have sex with commercial and non-regular partners, have infrequent condom use with non-regular partners and of not have used condom in their first sex. Despite more sexual practices among MDQ+ patients before HIV diagnosis, these patients had a more significant reduction of all behaviors after HIV diagnosis than the MDQ- group."
8860,0.005,5.0,"Increased access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) by human immunodeficiency virus postive (HIV⁺) individuals has become a reality worldwide. In Brazil, HAART currently reaches over half of HIV-infected subjects. In the context of a remarkable HIV-1 genetic variability, highly related variants, called quasispecies, are generated. HIV quasispecies generated during infection can influence virus persistence and pathogenicity, representing a challenge to treatment. However, the clinical relevance of minority quasispecies is still uncertain. In this study, we have determined the archived proviral sequences, viral subtype and drug resistance mutations from a cohort of HIV⁺ patients with undetectable viral load undergoing HAART as first-line therapy using next-generation sequencing for near full-length virus genome (NFLG) assembly. HIV-1 consensus sequences representing NFLG were obtained for eleven patients, while for another twelve varying genome coverage rates were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis showed the predominance of subtype B (83%; 19/23). Considering the minority variants, 18 patients carried archived virus harboring at least one mutation conferring antiretroviral resistance; for six patients, the mutations correlated with the current ARVs used. These data highlight the importance of monitoring HIV minority drug resistant variants and their clinical impact, to guide future regimen switches and improve HIV treatment success."
5483,0.005,5.0,"The evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection is associated with a shift in the target cell population, driven by variability in coreceptor utilization resulting from diversity in env. To elucidate the potential consequences of these changes for Env-mediated fusion over the course of AIDS, we examined the biological properties of serial viral isolates and determined coreceptor utilization by the products of env cloned from two individuals, followed from the detection of seroconversion throughout the course of their infection. One had a typical course, and the other had an accelerated progression. Early isolates were non-syncytium inducing, and the corresponding Env exclusively utilized CCR5, whereas Env from late phases of infection showed restricted utilization of CXCR4 in both patients. Env from subject SC24, who had a standard progression, demonstrated multitropism, manifested by utilization of CCR3, CXCR4, and CCR5 in the intervening period. In contrast, Env from patient SC51, who experienced early conversion to the syncytium-inducing phenotype, developed dualtropic coreceptor utilization of CCR5 and CXCR4. Genetic analysis of env from each isolate revealed that those with an X4 phenotype formed a distinct subcluster within each subject. Analysis of chimeras constructed from R5 and multispecific env from patient SC24 demonstrated that while the V3 domain played a dominant role in determining coreceptor utilization, sequences in the V4-V5 region also contributed to the latter phenotype. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the hybrid Env proteins were expressed at similar levels. These experiments demonstrate that progression from the R5 to X4 phenotype may occur through a multi- or dual-tropic intermediate and that multiple domains contribute to this process."
4422,0.005,5.0,"Although the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) has become a chronic illness, disease-specific advance care planning has not yet been evaluated for the palliative care needs of adults with HIV/AIDS. This prospective, longitudinal, randomized, two-arm controlled clinical trial aims to test the efficacy of FAmily CEntered advance care planning among adults living with AIDS and/or HIV with co-morbidities on congruence in treatment preferences, healthcare utilization, and quality of life. The FAmily CEntered intervention arm is two face-to-face sessions with a trained, certified facilitator: Session 1) Disease-Specific Advance Care Planning Respecting Choices Interview; Session 2) Completion of advance directive. The Healthy Living Control arm is: Session 1) Developmental/Relationship History; Session 2) Nutrition. Follow-up data will be collected at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-intervention. A total of 288 patient/surrogate dyads will be enrolled from five hospital-based, out-patient clinics in Washington, District of Columbia. Participants will be HIV positive and ≥ 21 years of age; surrogates will be ≥ 18 years of age. Exclusion criteria are homicidality, suicidality, psychosis, and impaired cognitive functioning. We hypothesize that this intervention will enhance patient-centered communication with a surrogate decision-maker about end of life treatment preferences over time, enhance patient quality of life and decrease health care utilization. We further hypothesize that this intervention will decrease health disparities for Blacks in completion of advance directives. If proposed aims are achieved, the benefits of palliative care, particularly increased treatment preferences about end-of-life care and enhanced quality of life, will be extended to people living with AIDS."

476,0.005,5.0,"Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses peak coincident with the decline in acute HIV viremia. Despite two reports of CTL-resistant HIV variants emerging during acute infection, the contribution of acute CTL escape to HIV pathogenesis remains unclear. Difficulties inherent in studying acute HIV infection can be overcome by modeling virus-host interactions in SIV-infected rhesus macaques. We sequenced 21 complete simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)mac239 genomes at four weeks post-infection to determine the extent of acute CTL escape. Here we show that viruses from 19 of 21 macaques escaped from CTLs during acute infection and that these escape-selecting CTLs were responsive to lower concentrations of peptide than other SIV-specific CTLs. Interestingly, CTLs that require low peptide concentrations for stimulation (high 'functional avidity') are particularly effective at controlling other viral infections. Our results suggest that acute viral escape from CTLs is a hallmark of SIV infection and that CTLs with high functional avidity can rapidly select for escape variants."
7837,0.005,5.0,"The effect of macrophage (M)-tropic and T cell line (T)-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection on antigen-specific CD4 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) has been studied using a CD4 CTL line specific for a peptide from influenza B virus hemagglutinin. In the absence of antigen presentation, the production of CC chemokines was low. Both the M-tropic HIV-1 strain (HIV-1AD) and the T-tropic HIV-1 strain (HIV-1LAI) established productive infections in the CD4 CTLs, decreasing antigen-specific cytotoxicity. Peptide presented to the CD4 CTLs increased their secretion of RANTES and MIP-1beta, suppressed M-tropic HIV-1 replication, downmodulated CCR5 expression, and preserved CTL recognition. The suppression of M-tropic HIV-1 replication and downmodulation of the CCR5 receptor likely resulted from CC chemokine secretion since antibodies to CC chemokines restored M-tropic HIV-1 replication. Antigen presentation did not protect CD4 CTLs from T-tropic HIV-1 infection or preserve their CTL recognition. Thus, these CD4 CTLs do not make suppressor factors that inhibit the T-tropic HIV-1LAI isolate. The results indicate that these CD4 CTLs can either harbor or suppress M-tropic HIV-1 infection, depending on whether antigen is present. CD4 CTLs might therefore provide some protection in the early stages of HIV-1 infection when M-tropic isolates are present."
4844,0.005,5.0,"A major barrier to the elimination of HIV-1 infection is the presence of a pool of long-lived, latently infected CD4+ memory T-cells. The search for treatments to re-activate latent HIV to aid in clearance is hindered by the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that lead to transcriptional silencing of viral gene expression in host cells. Here we identify a previously unknown role for RUNX1 in HIV-1 transcriptional latency. The RUNX proteins, in combination with the co-factor CBF-β, are critical transcriptional regulators in T-cells. RUNX1 strongly modulates CD4 expression and contributes to CD4+ T-cell function. We show that RUNX1 can bind DNA sequences within the HIV-1 LTR and that this binding represses transcription. Using patient samples we show a negative correlation between RUNX1 expression and viral load. Furthermore, we find that pharmacologic inhibition of RUNX1 by a small molecule inhibitor, Ro5-3335, synergizes with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA (Vorinostat) to enhance the activation of latent HIV-1 in both cell lines and PBMCs from patients. Our findings indicate that RUNX1 and CBF-β cooperate in cells to modulate HIV-1 replication, identifying for the first time RUNX1 as a cellular factor involved in HIV-1 latency. This work highlights the therapeutic potential of inhibitors of RUNX1 to re-activate virus and aid in clearance of HIV-1. "
2026,0.005,5.0,"We estimate how the effect of antiretroviral treatment depends on the time from HIV-infection to initiation of treatment, using observational data. A major challenge in making inferences from such observational data arises from biases associated with the nonrandom assignment of treatment, for example bias induced by dependence of time of initiation on disease status. To address this concern, we develop a new class of Structural Nested Mean Models (SNMMs) to estimate the impact of time of initiation of treatment after infection on an outcome measured a fixed duration after initiation, compared to the effect of not initiating treatment. This leads to a SNMM that models the effect of multiple dosages of treatment on a time-dependent outcome, in contrast to most existing SNNMs, which focus on the effect of one dosage of treatment on an outcome measured at the end of the study. Our identifying assumption is that there are no unmeasured confounders. We illustrate our methods using the observational Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP) Core01 database on HIV. The current standard of care in HIV-infected patients is Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Treatment (HAART); however, the optimal time to start HAART has not yet been identified. The new class of SNNMs allows estimation of the dependence of the effect of 1 year of HAART on the time between estimated date of infection and treatment initiation, and on patient characteristics. Results of fitting this model imply that early use of HAART substantially improves immune reconstitution in the early and acute phase of HIV-infection."
2578,0.005,5.0,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis prompted the reintroduction of para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) to protect companion anti-tuberculosis drugs from additional acquired resistance. In sub-Saharan Africa, MDR/XDR tuberculosis with HIV coinfection is common, and concurrent treatment of HIV infection and MDR/XDR tuberculosis is required. Out of necessity, patients receive multiple drugs, and PAS therapy is frequent; however, neither potential drug interactions nor the effects of HIV infection are known. Potential drug-drug interaction with PAS and the effect of HIV infection was examined in 73 pulmonary tuberculosis patients; 22 (30.1%) were HIV coinfected. Forty-one pulmonary MDR or XDR tuberculosis patients received 4 g PAS twice daily, and in a second crossover study, another 32 patients were randomized, receiving 4 g PAS twice daily or 8 g PAS once daily. A PAS population pharmacokinetic model in two dosing regimens was developed; potential covariates affecting its pharmacokinetics were examined, and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted evaluating the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic index. The probability of target attainment (PTA) to maintain PAS levels above MIC during the dosing interval was estimated by simulation of once-, twice-, and thrice-daily dosing regimens not exceeding 12 g daily. Concurrent efavirenz (EFV) medication resulted in a 52% increase in PAS clearance and a corresponding >30% reduction in mean PAS area under the concentration curve in 19 of 22 HIV-M. tuberculosis-coinfected patients. Current practice recommends maintenance of PAS concentrations at ≥1 μg/ml (the MIC of M. tuberculosis), but the model predicts that at only a minimum dose of 4 g twice daily can this PTA be achieved in at least 90% of the population, whether or not EFV is concomitantly administered. Once-daily dosing of 12 g PAS will not provide PAS concentrations exceeding the MIC over the entire dosing interval if coadministered with EFV, while 4 g twice daily ensures concentrations exceeding MIC over the entire dosing interval, even in HIV-infected patients who received EFV.

166,0.005,5.0,"To determine whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains in the lungs of infected individuals are derived from proviral forms contemporaneously present in the peripheral blood or whether they evolve independently as an autonomous pool of viral quasispecies, HIV-1 envelope V3 domain structures at these sites were analyzed and compared. The V3 loop proviral nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequences from lung bronchoalveolar lavage, where HIV-1 is primarily found in macrophages, were more homogeneous within individuals than those from unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where virus is predominantly in T cells. Comparison between individuals revealed that strains from bronchoalveolar lavage, but not from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, contained V3 domain nucleotide sequences with a great degree of homogeneity in the C-terminal region and a highly conserved, negatively charged amino acid motif. This V3 loop C-terminal structure could be important in the ability of HIV-1 to infect alveolar macrophages. Phylogenetic analyses of V3 domain nucleotide sequences in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage at both sites revealed the strains in lung macrophages to have evolved further from a presumed ancestral species than those in blood monocytes and to differ considerably in the inferred V3 loop amino acid structures. These results show that, as disease progression occurs, viral strains in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells within the lung and blood microenvironments are not in a state of unrestricted bidirectional traffic but, instead, evolve independently."
2498,0.005,5.0,"The spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has gradually decreased in Italy in the last 5 decades as shown by the steady reduction in the incidence rates of acute hepatitis B, from 10/100000 inhabitants in 1984 to 0.85/100000 in 2012, and by the reduced prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive cases among chronic hepatitis patients with different etiologies, from 60% in 1975 to about 10% in 2001. The prevalence of HBsAg chronic carriers in the general population also decreased from nearly 3% in the 1980s to 1% in 2010. Linked to HBV by its characteristics of defective virus, the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) has shown a similar epidemiological impact on the Italian population over time. The incidence of acute HDV infection decreased from 3.2/100000 inhabitants in 1987 to 0.8/100000 in 2010 and the prevalence of HDV infection in HBsAg chronic carriers decreased from 24% in 1990 to 8.5% in 2006. Before the beneficial effects of HBV mass vaccination introduced in 1991, the decreased endemicity of HBV and HDV infection in Italy paralleled the improvement in screening blood donations, the higher standard of living and impressive reduction in the birth rate associated with a marked reduction in the family size. A further contribution to the decline in HBV and HDV infections most probably came from the media campaigns to prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus infection by focusing the attention of the general population on the same routes of transmission of viral infections such as unsafe sexual intercourse and parenteral exposures of different kinds.

2954,0.005,5.0,"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection treated with alpha interferon and subsequent loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) eliminate HDV. HDV RNA was detected in 26 of 28 patients with chronic delta hepatitis using the polymerase chain reaction. Seventeen patients in whom HDV RNA was detected were treated with alpha interferon; in 65%, HDV RNA remained detectable during treatment or reappeared after stopping therapy whereas in three patients HDV RNA remained absent (17.5%). HDV RNA became and remained undetectable in serum and liver of two of these three patients who lost HBsAg from serum and in one patient who was intermittently HBsAg negative during therapy. After loss of HBsAg, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was still detectable in the liver, but not HBV RNA, indicating absent or very low HBV replication. Three patients were lost to follow up (17.5%). Two nontreated patients with chronic HDV infection also lost HBsAg during follow up; HDV RNA also became undetectable in their serum. Thus, HDV replication does not persist after the loss of HBsAg. Clearance of HBsAg may be a useful guide to when therapy can be stopped."
6449,0.005,5.0,"Epidemiological data on hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in Belgium are lacking. A multicenter questionnaire-based registry on HDV infection was collated between March 1, 2008 and February 28, 2009. It consisted of patients coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV. The data samples were compared to those of a concurrent registry on HBV infection. Prospective data of patients with HBV-HDV coinfection were collected. Active HBV replication is defined as HBeAg positivity or HBV DNA > 2,000 IU/ml. Forty-four patients from 15 centers were registered. A comparison of 29 patients infected with HDV (registered in the concurrent HBV registry) was made against 785 HBV mono-infected patients. The seroprevalence of patients coinfected with HBV and HDV in Belgium is reported to be 3.7% (29/785), consisting solely of the HBV-HDV coinfected patients in the HBV registry. This rises to 5.5% (44/800) if all patients infected with HDV from the two registries combined are included. The patients coinfected with HBV and HDV had higher (P < 0.05) ALT values and more advanced liver disease (Metavir score ≥F2), but had less active HBV replication and lower HBV DNA titers when compared with the patients infected only with HBV. Additionally, the majority of HBV-HDV coinfected patient was male, and 13.6% (6/44) of the patients that were coinfected HBV and HDV were also infected with HCV. In conclusion, this study provided much needed epidemiological data on the current state of HDV infection in Belgium."

Consistent with the reciprocal model of pain and smoking, PLWHA with pain who smoke may use smoking as a means of coping with pain, thus presenting a potential barrier to quitting. The aim of this study is to better understand how pain relates to smoking cessation among 474 HIV-positive adults enrolled in a cell phone-delivered smoking cessation trial."
4038,0.005,5.0,"Pegylated-IFN and ribavirin remains the current treatment for chronic HCV infection in patients co-infected with HIV-1, but this regimen has low efficacy rates, particularly for HCV genotype 1/4 infection, has severe side effects and is extremely costly. Therefore, accurate prediction of treatment response is urgently required. We have recently shown that the NK cell gene, KIR2DS3 and a SNP associated with the IL28B gene synergise to increase the risk of chronic infection in primary HCV mono-infected patients. Identification of SNPs associated with the IL28B gene has also proven very powerful for predicting patient response to treatment. Patients co-infected with HIV-1 are of particular concern given they respond less well to HCV treatment, have more side effects and suffer a more rapid liver disease progression. In this study, we examined both IL28B and KIR2DS3 for their ability to predict treatment response in a cohort of HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients attending two treatment centres in Europe. We found that variation in both host genetic risk factors, IL28B and KIR2DS3, was strongly associated with sustained virological response (SVR) to treatment in our co-infected cohort (n = 149). The majority of patients who achieved a rapid virological response (RVR) achieved a SVR. However, it is currently impossible to predict treatment outcome in patients who fail to achieve an RVR. In our cohort, the presence of host genetic risk factors, IL28B-T and KIR2DS3 alleles, resulted in increased odds of treatment failure in these RVR negative patients (n = 88). Our data suggests that testing for host genetic factors will improve predicting treatment responsiveness in the clinical management of co-infected patients, and provides further evidence of the importance of the innate immune system in the immune response to HCV. "
2318,0.005,5.0,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI) is defined as the presence of HBV DNA in the liver (with or without detectable HBV DNA in serum) for individuals testing HBV surface antigen negative. Until recently, the clinical effect of OBI was unclear on the progression of liver disease; on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma; and on the risk for reactivation or transmission of HBV infection. Several studies suggest a high prevalence of OBI among patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease, but its role in the progression to cirrhosis remains unclear. Although OBI has been well documented in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, especially among those coinfected with hepatitis C virus, further studies are needed to determine its current clinical impact in HIV setting."
6204,0.005,5.0,"Several studies had previously demonstrated the high sensitivity and specificity of JCV DNA detection in CSF by PCR. This paper reported the implementation of a simple PCR procedure to detect JCV in the CSF in a cohort of HIV-1 infected patients from Argentina. Years ago, the confirmatory diagnosis of this disease was made by in-situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry techniques on brain biopsies. The PCR procedure described here improves the diagnosis of PML because it is simple and noninvasive, and allows the differential diagnosis of PML from other neurological syndromes associated with AIDS. Many recent studies report a significant benefit of combined antiretroviral therapy on the survival of HIV patients without clear neurological improvements. A negative correlation has been described between the concentration of JCV in the CSF and survival time in HIV-1 infected patients, and the level of immune depression may influence JCV replication. This suggests that a single CSF JCV viral load determination during the course of PML disease progression may be of prognostic value for managing HIV patients."
2398,0.005,5.0,"In the current study we investigated the prevalence of the TNF-α 238G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the TNF-α gene in the development of lipodystrophy among HIV-1 infected individuals who had been receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the immunodeficiency clinics of the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) at Pune, India. We assessed the association of this SNP with the development of lipoatrophy/dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in these patients and measured carotid intima thickening which is a surrogate marker for chronic cardiac morbidity. Our results show that the incidence of the TNF-α 238G/A SNP is ~ two fold higher in patients with lipodystrophy as compared to those without lipodystrophy. Patients with lipodystrophy demonstrated a higher likelihood of the development of metabolic syndrome as evident by increased insulin sensitivity and increased percentage (%) β cell function. Further, a significant increase in left carotid intima thickness was observed in patients with lipodystrophy. Our study validates the association of the TNF-α 238G/A SNP allelic variant with the development of HIV- lipodystrophy via the modulation of TNF-α production, which contributes to dyslipidemia, increased lipolysis, increased insulin resistance, altered differentiation of adipocytes and increased carotid intima thickness. The contribution of genetic determinants such as the TNF-α 238G/A SNP to lipodystrophy, may provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie this disease condition and may be useful in the future for personalized therapy. Additionally, these findings will be useful in monitoring chronic cardiac morbidities among HIV infected individuals who express this SNP. "
3662,0.005,5.0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can suppress HIV-1 replication and normalize the chronic immune activation associated with infection, but restoration of naïve CD4+ T cell populations is slow and usually incomplete for reasons that have yet to be determined. We tested the hypothesis that damage to the lymphoid tissue (LT) fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) network contributes to naïve T cell loss in HIV-1 infection by restricting access to critical factors required for T cell survival. We show that collagen deposition and progressive loss of the FRC network in LTs prior to treatment restrict both access to and a major source of the survival factor interleukin-7 (IL-7). As a consequence, apoptosis within naïve T cell populations increases significantly, resulting in progressive depletion of both naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. We further show that the extent of loss of the FRC network and collagen deposition predict the extent of restoration of the naïve T cell population after 6 month of HAART, and that restoration of FRC networks correlates with the stage of disease at which the therapy is initiated. Because restoration of the FRC network and reconstitution of naïve T cell populations are only optimal when therapy is initiated in the early/acute stage of infection, our findings strongly suggest that HAART should be initiated as soon as possible. Moreover, our findings also point to the potential use of adjunctive anti-fibrotic therapies to avert or moderate the pathological consequences of LT fibrosis, thereby improving immune reconstitution."
8868,0.005,5.0,"The World Health Organization developed a set of human immunodeficiency virus drug resistance (HIVDR) early warning indicators (EWIs) to assess antiretroviral therapy clinic and program factors associated with HIVDR. EWIs are monitored by abstracting data routinely recorded in clinical records, and the results enable clinics and program managers to identify problems that should be addressed to minimize preventable emergence of HIVDR in clinic populations. As of June 2011, 50 countries monitored EWIs, covering 131 686 patients initiating antiretroviral treatment between 2004 and 2009 at 2107 clinics. HIVDR prevention is associated with patient care (appropriate prescribing and patient monitoring), patient behavior (adherence), and clinic/program management efforts to reduce treatment interruptions (follow up, retention on first-line ART, procurement and supply management of antiretroviral drugs). EWIs measure these factors and the results have been used to optimize patient and population treatment outcomes."
2504,0.005,5.0,"Minority variant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance mutations are associated with an increased risk of virological failure during treatment with NNRTI-containing regimens. To determine whether individuals to whom variants with isolated NNRTI-associated drug resistance were transmitted are at increased risk of virological failure during treatment with a non-NNRTI-containing regimen, we identified minority variant resistance mutations in 33 individuals with isolated NNRTI-associated transmitted drug resistance and 49 matched controls. We found similar proportions of overall and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated minority variant resistance mutations in both groups, suggesting that isolated NNRTI-associated transmitted drug resistance may not be a risk factor for virological failure during treatment with a non-NNRTI-containing regimen."
6919,0.005,5.0,"This consensus document has been prepared by a panel consisting of members of the AIDS Study Group (Gesida) and the Spanish Secretariat for the National Plan on AIDS (SPNS) after reviewing the efficacy and safety results of clinical trials, cohort and pharmacokinetic studies published in medical journals, or presented in medical scientific meetings. Gesida has prepared an objective and structured method to prioritise combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) in naïve patients. Recommendations strength (A, B, C) and the evidence which supports them (I, II, III) are based on a modification of the Infectious Diseases Society of America criteria. The current antiretroviral treatment (ART) of choice for chronic HIV infection is the combination of three drugs. ART is recommended in patients with symptomatic HIV infection, in pregnancy, in serodiscordant couples with high transmission risk, hepatitis B fulfilling treatment criteria, and HIV nephropathy. Guidelines on ART treatment in patients with concurrent diagnosis of HIV infection and an opportunistic type C infection are included. In asymptomatic patients ART is recommended on the basis of CD4 lymphocyte counts, plasma viral load and patient co-morbidities, as follows: 1) therapy should be started in patients with CD4 counts <350 cells/μL; 2) when CD4 counts are between 350 and 500 cells/μL, therapy will be recommended and only delayed if patient is reluctant to take it, the CD4 are stabilised, and the plasma viral load is low; 3) therapy could be deferred when CD4 counts are above 500 cells/μL, but should be considered in cases of cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis C, high cardiovascular risk, plasma viral load >10(5) copies/mL, proportion of CD4 cells <14%, and in people aged >55 years. ART should include 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitors nucleoside analogues and a third drug (non-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor or integrase inhibitor). The panel has consensually selected and given priority to using the Gesida score for some drug combinations, some of them co-formulated. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable viral load. Adherence to therapy plays an essential role in maintaining antiviral response. Therapeutic options are limited after ART failures, but an undetectable viral load may be possible nowadays. Adverse events are a fading problem of ART. Guidelines in acute HIV infection, in women, in pregnancy, and to prevent mother-to-child transmission and pre- and post-exposition prophylaxis are commented upon. Management of hepatitis B or C co-infection, other co-morbidities, and the characteristics of ART in HIV-2 infection are included."
7191,0.005,5.0,"In our HIV outpatient centre where over 1,200 patients are followed, maraviroc as an entry inhibitor was introduced in 2010. We aimed to assess the background, the therapeutic challenges and the prospective monitoring of all patients treated with a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including maraviroc. Sixty-six patients started a maraviroc-containing cART with a history of HIV infection lasting 13.9±10.7 years. This interim analysis presents patients who had at least 12 (mean 16.9±12.8) months of follow-up. One to 17 previous cART changes prompted the introduction of maraviroc in rescue regimens in the great majority of patients considered (53 of 66); in 13 cases, maraviroc was given to patients with advanced HIV disease and no immune recovery after 2-3 years of a virologically-effective cART. The most frequent companion antiretroviral agents were: darunavir/ritonavir (51 cases), raltegravir (49 subjects), and etravirine (36 cases). The most common underlying conditions were: AIDS (41 cases), liver cirrhosis (21), AIDS-related or other malignancies (20 cases), major cardiovascular events (18 cases), osteonecrosis and haemodialysis-treated kidney failure (3 cases each). A chronic HCV and HBV hepatitis were of concern in 25 and 13 patients. The addition of maraviroc added favourably to clinical-laboratory markers of HIV disease progression, and those of comorbid conditions. HIV viraemia became (or remained) undetectable in 55 patients of 66 (83.3%). An improvement in CD4+ count was observed in all 66 patients, based on a mean 24.9±19.2% increase versus baseline, paralleled by an improvement in mean absolute CD4+ count of 134.7±121.1 cells/μL. A tendency towards an increased mean and peak CD4+ count was observed in the subgroup receiving a maraviroc-raltegravir-based cART. As no clinical-laboratory adverse events attributable to maraviroc occurred, nobody discontinued the study drug. Only mild-transient gastrointestinal disturbances, fatigue and anorexia, were reported during maraviroc administration, but their relationship with the study drug was difficult to assess because of the multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy. Our preliminary experience with maraviroc, even considering the limits of the proportionally reduced sample, the patients' salvage stage of advanced disease and the related-unrelated morbidities, underlines its excellent efficacy and safety profile."
7846,0.005,5.0,"The rapidity of HIV-RNA suppression after initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) may impact immune reconstitution in developing countries, where patients initiate cART at low CD4 T cell counts. One hundred and thirty-five HIV-1 Mozambican adults initiating cART were prospectively followed over 16 months within a larger observational study. Plasma HIV-RNA, CD4 counts, and CD8 T cell activation were monitored at the pre-cART visit and at 4, 10, and 16 months during cART. Of the 89 patients with available HIV-RNA data at pre-cART and 4 and 10 months post-cART, 68% (60/89) suppressed HIV-RNA at 4 months and were defined as ""early virological controllers""(EC). Twenty of the 29 remaining patients who did not control HIV-RNA at 4 months did so at 10 months and were classified as ""late virological controllers""(LC). Nine (10%) patients did not control HIV-RNA at either time point. Both initiating an EFV-containing cART regimen and having pre-cART tuberculosis were significantly associated with early HIV-RNA suppression if locked into a multivariate model [EFV OR: 13.6 (95% CI 1.7; 108.1) p = 0.014) tuberculosis OR: 11.0 (95% CI 1.4; 87.9) p = 0.024]. EC demonstrated significantly lower median activated CD8 T cells at 4, 10, and 16 months post-cART than did LC. Approximately 63% (12/19) of LC experienced reappearance of detectable HIV-RNA at 6 months postcontrol as compared to 15% (2/60) of EC (p = 0.001). This study suggests that rapid suppression of HIV-RNA may lead to a lower rate of reappearance of HIV-RNA, which could impact CD8 T cell activation levels in patients initiating cART at low CD4 counts."
5232,0.005,5.0,"India has approximately 5.2 million persons infected with HIV. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is being widely introduced in public clinics, many HIV-infected persons still seek care via the private sector. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2004 at six public and private sites to characterize the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of ART among patients with HIV receiving care in India. Of 1667 persons surveyed, 609 (36%) had heard of ART and 19% of these persons reported that ART could cure HIV. Twenty-four percent reported that they were currently taking ART, with 18% of these patients not actually on ART according to their provider. Major barriers to taking ART were cost (33%), lack of knowledge of ART (41%), and deferral by physician (30%). More than half of all public and private patients had not heard of CD4 (57%) or viral load testing (80%), and even fewer had received these tests (32% and 11%, respectively). Private clinic attendees were almost 4 times more likely to be on ART (35% versus 9%, p < 0.0001), more likely to be male, have a higher education, be partnered, have a higher income, and have had a CD4 or viral load (p < 0.0001). Overall, low levels of ART knowledge and access were observed among HIV infected patients, with access to ART being particularly low among patients attending public clinics. In order to make widespread dissemination of ART effective in India, further educational and programmatic efforts are likely needed to optimize access, treatment awareness, and compliance among patients with HIV."
6983,0.005,5.0,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are prevalent worldwide, and share similar means of transmission. These infections may influence each other in evolution and outcome, including cancer or immunodeficiency. Many studies have reported the influence of genetic markers on the host immune response against different persistent viral infections, such as HTLV-1 infection, pointing to the importance of the individual genetic background on their outcomes. However, despite recent advances on the knowledge of the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infection, gaps in the understanding of the role of the individual genetic background on the progress to disease clinically manifested still remain. In this scenario, much less is known regarding the influence of genetic factors in the context of dual or triple infections or their influence on the underlying mechanisms that lead to outcomes that differ from those observed in monoinfection. This review describes the main factors involved in the virus-host balance, especially for some particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes, and other important genetic markers in the development of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and other persistent viruses, such as HIV and HCV.

Antibody to HIV-2 was found by enzyme immunoassay and was verified by radioimmunoprecipitation. The patient was being treated for pulmonary tuberculosis at the time of her admission to our institution. Further laboratory and clinical evaluation at our facility revealed depressed CD4 lymphocytes, oral candidiasis, and cryptococcal meningitis with indeterminate results on serologic testing for HIV type 1 (HIV-1). The biopsy specimen of a lesion in the right occipital lobe of the brain documented Toxoplasma gondii, indicating a clinical diagnosis of AIDS. To our knowledge, our study presents the first known patient with HIV-2-associated AIDS in the United States. Our patient provides further evidence that HIV-2 causes severe immunodeficiency and opportunistic infection. The condition should be suspected in the face of normal or repeatedly equivocal HIV-1 antibody test results in the presence of clinically documented AIDS."
6797,0.005,5.0,"The immune mechanisms associated with the evolution from latent to clinically active mycobacterial coinfection in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected humans remain poorly understood. Previous work has demonstrated that macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) can develop persistent Mycobacterium bovis BCG coinfection and a fatal SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease by 4 months after BCG inoculation. In the present study, SIVmac-infected monkeys that developed clinically quiescent mycobacterial infection after BCG inoculation were followed prospectively for the reactivation of the BCG and the development of SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease. The development of clinically latent BCG coinfection in these SIVmac-infected monkeys was characterized by a change from high to undetectable levels of bacterial organisms, with or without measurable BCG mRNA expression in lymph node cells. The reactivation of clinically latent BCG coinfection and development of SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease were then observed in these SIVmac-BCG-coinfected monkeys during a 21-month period of follow-up. The reactivation of SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease in these animals coincided with a severe depletion of CD4 T cells and a loss of BCG-specific T-cell responses. Interestingly, bacterial superantigen challenge of the SIVmac-BCG-coinfected monkeys resulted in an up-regulation of clinically latent BCG coinfection, suggesting that infection with superantigen-producing microbes may increase the susceptibility of individuals to the reactivation of AIDS-related mycobacterial coinfection. Thus, reactivation of latent mycobacterial infections in HIV-1-infected individuals may result from a loss of T-cell immunity or from a superimposed further compromise of the immune system."
4864,0.005,5.0,"HIV transmitted drug resistance (TDR) can compromise antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited countries like China where ART has been scaled up and thus leads to an important public health concern. The aim of the study was to elucidate the HIV-1 genetic characteristics and TDR in Hangzhou, China. Two-hundred eleven ART-naive, newly diagnosed individuals were enrolled during January and August 2013. Specimens were classified as recent or chronic infections using the BED capture enzyme immunoassay (BED-CEIA). The pol fragment covering the entire protease and the first 300 codons of the reverse transcriptase gene was amplified by RT-PCR and nested PCR. Genotypic drug resistance (DR) and phylogenetic analysis were performed on the 200 obtained sequences. Multiple genotypes were identified, including CRF01_AE (62.0%), CRF07_BC (31.0%), subtype B (2.0%), CRF08_BC (1.5%), CRF55_01B (1.0%), CRF18_cpx (0.5%), and unique recombinant forms (URFs, 2.0%). All the four URFs were found in men who have sex with men, consisting of a recombination of CRF01_AE with subtype B or CRF07_BC. The prevalence of primary DR in newly diagnosed individuals in Hangzhou was low (4.0%). The proportion of DR mutation to protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was 1.5%, 1.5%, and 1.0%, respectively. BED-CEIA revealed that 21.8% (45/211) of the specimens were associated with recent infections. The prevalence of TDR in recent infections was moderate (6.5%). High HIV diversity and relatively high prevalence of TDR in new infections has been found in Hangzhou, indicating an increasing challenge for future HIV prevention and treatment."

The features of the illness conformed to a syndrome of HDV infection in young males carrying the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); a latent HBsAg state was documented in many patients by a history of prior exposure to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) or by the absence of IgM antibodies to the HB core antigen. Characteristic of the disease were the clinical overture as a severe hepatitis, the lobular involvement by an extensive necroinflammatory reaction, the exuberant expression of intrahepatic hepatitis delta antigen and an atypical HBV profile of inactive infection or accelerated seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe. Superimposed upon HBV infection, HDV may create a rapidly progressive course which resembles very aggressive hepatitis B but is infrequently observed in hepatitis B alone."
2656,0.005,5.0,"Postmortem cesarean sections are rare events, but modern technology is forcing society to explore the definition of viability and the legal rights of both mother and fetus that ultimately will affect the frequency and use of this rare operation. Since the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevalence rate and the number of critically ill obstetrical patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) continues to rise, it is reasonable to assume more patients and physicians may be confronted by issues concerning fetal and maternal rights and other considerations in perimortem delivery. A 33-year-old woman, at 27 weeks' gestation, with fulminant AIDS was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in respiratory distress. As her condition deteriorated the complex problem of caring for both mother and fetus emerged. A patient advisory panel explored the issues with the patient, her family, and her health care team. Eventually a peri/postmortem cesarean section was performed on the mother when she suffered an acute fatal cardiorespiratory arrest. With the prevalence of AIDS increasing and with most women not being tested prior to pregnancy, many obstetricians will be confronted with new medical and legal challenges. Establishing comprehensive medical management for the critically ill obstetrical patient and understanding the legal rights of both patients (mother and fetus) will help avoid conflicts and potentially improve survival."

6487,0.005,5.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and its associated diseases continue to increase despite the progress in our understanding of HIV biology and the availability of a number of antiretroviral drugs. Adherence is a significant factor in the success of HIV therapy and current HIV treatment regimens require a combination of antiviral drugs to be taken at least daily for the remainder of a patient's life. A drug delivery system that allows sustained drug delivery could reduce the medical burden and costs associated with medication nonadherence. Here, we describe a novel supramolecular assembly or matrix that contains an anionic polymer hyaluronic acid, cationic polymer poly-l-lysine, and anionic oligosaccharide sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin. HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors Zidovudine and Lamivudine were successfully encapsulated into the polymer assembly in a noncovalent manner. The physicochemical properties and antiviral activity of the polymer assemblies were studied. The results of this study suggest that the supramolecular assemblies loaded with HIV drugs exert potent antiviral activity and allow sustained drug release. A novel drug delivery formulation such as the one described here could facilitate our efforts to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infections and could be utilized in the design of therapeutic approaches for other diseases."
5025,0.005,5.0,"Exenatide is an incretin mimetic indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, metformin, or metformin plus a sulfonylurea or thiazolidinedione. Exenatide lowers postprandial blood glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and increasing satiety. Therapy with exenatide often results in weight loss, which further assists in decreasing insulin resistance. This feature makes the drug an attractive therapeutic option for obese patients. We report the successful off-label use of exenatide in an obese, 40-year-old man with type 1 diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who had gastrointestinal intolerance to pramlintide. The patient had experienced a dramatic weight gain secondary to his antiretroviral drugs. This weight gain led to insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes; thus he had characteristics of both types 1 and 2 diabetes, or double diabetes. Before the start of exenatide therapy, he weighed 123 kg, had a body mass index of 42.3 kg/m(2), and had a suboptimal hemoglobin A(1c) value of 8.7%. After 11 months of therapy, the patient lost 24 kg (19.5% of his body weight) and achieved a hemoglobin A(1c) value of 7.3%. His basal insulin requirement was reduced by 25%, and his use of short-acting insulin before breakfast and before dinner was discontinued. In addition, the patient's quality of life substantially improved, as he was able to return to work and exercise after being nearly incapacitated by his weight. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report of the use of exenatide in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Given this experience, exenatide may prove to be a useful alternative in selected patients with type 1 diabetes."
8959,0.005,5.0,"Transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne viruses in hospitals is discussed, and the infection control system and worker protection and education plan at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) are described. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic has led to increased concern about occupationally acquired infections in health-care workers. As the number of HIV-infected persons increases, so does the risk of infection. Occupationally acquired HIV infection of health-care workers occurs principally in nurses, phlebotomists, and laboratory technicians through accidental subcutaneous injection of contaminated blood; splashing of blood onto open skin lesions, the eyes, and mucous membranes represents another route of exposure. The risk of infection from a single needle-stick exposure to HIV-infected blood is about 0.4%. Other blood-borne viruses to which employees are vulnerable include hepatitis B virus and human T-cell lymphotropic viruses, which may cause leukemia and lymphoma. SFGH has a comprehensive infection control system. Specimen containers are enclosed in transparent secondary containers, the worker is encouraged to wear protective clothing when necessary, and specific needle-stick precautions are promoted. There is also a health-care worker protection and education plan. The employee health services department provides immunizations, keeps records on accidental exposures, and operates a hot line. The education committee disseminates educational materials and arranges lectures. Infection control and education provide simple but effective measures for protecting hospital employees against HIV and other occupationally acquired infections."
3990,0.005,5.0,"A year ago, the New Jersey case of William H. Behringer, the surgeon with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), caused health experts to focus on health care workers infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and to call for new policies and guidelines to protect patients against infection. After a year of acrimonious debate over the proper approach to the issues discussed in Behringer, no consensus has emerged. The Centers for Disease Control has quietly abandoned its plan to ease its July 1991 guidelines that call for infected professionals to cease performing invasive procedures or disclose their conditions to their patients. It has now decided to let each state set its own rules and regulations in compliance with its guidelines, or risk financial penalties. The issues discussed in Behringer have remained controversial. This case provides an opportunity to identify reasonable actions that may ensure patient safety without inciting public fears, unduly restricting individual freedom, or violating human rights."
720,0.005,5.0,"The scarcity of liver donors requires consideration of grafts from sources not previously used. Allografts from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-carriers without a significant liver disease have been proposed for liver transplant recipients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Combination prophylaxis schemes against HBV post-liver transplantation (LT) recurrence are currently available; the efficacy of those schemes in HBV-related cirrhosis and HCC must be assessed. This report describes the allocation of HBsAg-positive grafts in three HBsAg-positive recipients, with HBV-related cirrhosis and evolving HCC lesions, two of them with hepatitis Delta virus (HDV) coinfection. Patients were administered anti-hepatitis B immunoglobulins (HBIGs) and lamivudine in order to prevent HBV recurrence. In spite of anti-HBV prophylaxis, HBV infection did persist after LT in all patients (no serum clearance of HBsAg). HBV replication assessed by serum HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) presence was detected in the first month after LT in the 3 recipients. A prompt HDV reinfection with a clinical and histological pattern of hepatitis was observed in the 2 HBV / HDV coinfected recipients. In 1 of them, an evolving chronic hepatitis required a second LT. The non-HDV-infected patient showed an uneventful follow-up, but the lack of the neutralizing effect of HBIGs and the high risk of escape mutants forced the addition of adefovir-dipivoxil to lamivudine, in order to prevent viral variants and hepatitis recurrence. In conclusion, allografts from HBsAg-positive donors in HBsAg-positive recipients are associated with the persistence of the HBsAg after LT due to the failure of HBIG prophylaxis, even if lamivudine does inhibit virion production. This condition favors HDV replication and HDV hepatitis recurrence in coinfected patients. The allocation of HBsAg-positive grafts in HBsAg-positive recipients could be justified only in recipients without HDV coinfection and a combined prophylaxis with lamivudine and adefovir-dipivoxil is currently the best way to manage escape mutants in these recipients."
6938,0.005,5.0,"In 1999 a Swedish national expert panel published recommendations for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection. Recently, pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) products have been introduced, and an increased knowledge concerning treatment of acute HCV and HCV-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection has been gained. As a result of this, an update of the Swedish recommendations was developed following an expert meeting in October 2002. The panel now recommends the use of peg-IFN together with ribavirin as the standard treatment. Owing to the excellent response rates in HCV genotype 2 and 3 infections, these patients can be treated for 24 weeks without preceding liver biopsy. For patients with genotype 1 infection (with a slightly below 50% sustained response rate after 48 weeks treatment) and only mild histological disease, treatment can be postponed until future better treatment options become available. In patients who fail to achieve a 99% reduction (2 log drop) in viral titre after 12 weeks of treatment, discontinuation of therapy is recommended. Patients previously treated with IFN monotherapy and not having achieved a sustained virological response are recommended the same combination treatment as treatment-naive patients. IFN monotherapy is recommended in patients with acute hepatitis C. For children with chronic HCV infection, combination treatment is mainly recommended in clinical trials. For HCV-HIV coinfected patients, combination treatment is recommended and preferably given when blood CD4 counts are above 350/ml and before antiretroviral treatment (ART) is needed. Concurrent ART or prominent liver fibrosis requires frequent monitoring because of the increased risk for mitochondrial toxicity and liver failure."

4954,0.005,5.0,"Patients with inherited bleeding disorders who received clotting factor concentrates before 1987 have high rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HCV/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. To determine whether the persistent nature of HIV affects the genetic diversity of HCV by less selective pressure through the immunosuppression of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, both the change of genetic diversity and selective pressure were examined in the HCV envelope genes (E1 and E2) of 325 genotype 1a subclones from eight HIV-positive and five HIV-negative patients with two time points (more than 6 years apart). To infer the genetic diversity of HCV in each patient, we used two approaches. One method was to estimate the difference of total evolutionary distances in the phylogenetic tree between the two time points, and another was to estimate the changes of genetic diversity along the time based on the coalescence theory. The two results indicate that the HIV-positive group has significantly more diverse population structure than the HIV-negative group. A comparative analysis of the synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions found that the HIV-positive group was subject to less selective pressure than the HIV-negative group. In conclusion, HIV-positive patients would have a more diversified HCV population than HIV-negative patients due to less selective pressure from the immune system."
1514,0.005,5.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can evolve by mutations in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) to permit its escape from neutralization by antibodies such as HBV surface antibody (anti-HBs) and from host immune responses. This study investigated the prevalence and pattern of MHR mutations in North China and the clinical correlations of these mutations. The MHRs of 161 HBsAg-positive patients were amplified using nested PCR, and directly sequenced to identify MHR mutations. It was showed that among the 161 patients infected with HBV genotype C in North China, the overall frequency of MHR mutation was 46.6%. Furthermore, MHR mutations were associated with high white blood cell counts (P = 0.025), high bilirubin levels (P = 0.048), and cirrhosis (P = 0.010). The most frequent mutations in patients with both HBsAg-positive and anti-HBs-positive were located in subregion 1 and 3 of MHR, specifically, residue Q101 (29.9%) and I126 (70.6%), which was different from the mutation pattern found in Western Europe and the United States. Taken together, these data indicated important virological and clinical aspects of HBV evolution in terms of the surface gene of genotype C, which might be important for its response to the currently available HBV vaccine."
3843,0.005,5.0,"Pulmonary hypertension is an important cause of dyspnoea in human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) patients. The effect highly active antiretroviral therapy on pulmonary artery pressure has been an area of controversy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of antiretroviral therapy on pulmonary hypertension in HIV patients. This prospective cohort study was performed in a peripheral medical college of West Bengal with 88 patients from October 2008 to September 2011. By echocardiography, pulmonary artery pressure was recorded before initiation of antiretroviral therapy. After one year of antiretroviral therapy repeat echocardiography was done and pulmonary artery pressure was evaluated. The values were analysed. The present study showed that highly active antiretroviral therapy improves pulmonary artery pressure in HIV/AIDS patients if instituted at early stages (WHO classes I and II). However, at more advanced stages of pulmonary artery hypertension, it does not have any significant effect on reduction of the same. The present study documents that early detection of pulmonary artery hypertension in HIV/AIDS patients is essential and prompt institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy should be considered in them even when those patients do not fulfill the conventional criteria for initiation of this treatment."
4489,0.005,5.0,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with a high incidence of lymphoma. Typically, the lymphomas are B-cell in origin, and although they occur in the setting of HIV-1 infection, historical studies have found no evidence for the presence of HIV-1 within the transformed B-cells. We describe a new class of large cell lymphoma wherein HIV p24 expression within the tumor specimens was found to be extremely high. In the first case, HIV was expressed in the tumor-associated transformed T-cells. In three other cases, HIV was found to be highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages. These tumors exhibited a mixed immunophenotype histologically. Analysis by inverse polymerase chain reaction, using HIV long terminal repeat primers, demonstrated monoclonal HIV integration sites for all four tumors. Direct sequencing of the T-cell lymphoma inverse polymerase chain reaction products identified the HIV integration site within the fur gene, just upstream from the c-fes/fps protooncogene. Using segments of the fur gene as a probe, the other three monoclonal integration sites mapped to the same region. Although the integration and up-regulation of c-fes/fps was localized to the tumor cells within the T-cell lymphoma, the cells containing the monoclonal HIV in the other mixed immunophenotype lymphomas are currently unknown. These observations suggest that HIV may contribute directly to lymphomagenesis and identify a common site of HIV integration within a subset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome lymphoma."
4888,0.005,5.0,"Because the time from primary infection to symptoms in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is typically 8-10 years, the use of surrogate markers to monitor disease progression and therapeutic efficacy is of interest. An acid dissociation procedure that disrupts the p24 antigen-antibody complexes found in early HIV-1 infection has greatly increased the sensitivity of p24 detection assays. The utility of p24 antigen after acid treatment as a surrogate marker of disease progression and therapeutic effect in asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects receiving zidovudine (AZT) was determined. After acid treatment, the sensitivity of p24 antigen detection increased fivefold. The proportion of subjects who were antigenemic increased over the 48-week follow-up in the placebo group; approximately 50% of subjects who were p24 antigen-positive at entry and who received AZT showed clearance or a greater than 50% reduction in baseline p24 antigen levels at 16 and 32 weeks. Thus, acid treatment of plasma may allow the use of p24 antigen as a marker of disease progression and therapeutic response."
5890,0.005,5.0,"We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of neopterin, a putative marker of activated macrophages, in 97 subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 who had a spectrum of neurological complications. The highest CSF neopterin concentrations occurred in those with neurological opportunistic infections, primary central nervous systems lymphoma, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex. In general, the CSF concentration of neopterin was independent of CSF cell count and blood-brain barrier disruption to albumin. In the patients with AIDS dementia complex, CSF neopterin concentrations correlated with severity of disease and decreased in conjunction with clinical improvement following treatment with zidovudine. These results suggest that CSF neopterin, although not disease-specific, may be useful as a surrogate marker for the presence of AIDS dementia complex and its response to antiviral therapy."
1983,0.005,5.0,"In Poland, as in many other countries, HIV infection is often detected at a late stage. We conducted this study to determine if Polish medical students possess adequate HIV/AIDS knowledge and diagnostic skills needed to improve HIV detection and care in Poland. Between 2004 and 2006, sixth-year (senior) medical students at the Medical University of Bialystok were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire with questions about HIV transmission route and clinical characteristics. Although more than 50% of student respondents estimated their knowledge of HIV/AIDS as good or very good, HIV/AIDS knowledge assessment results did not support this self-reported level of proficiency. More than 40% of students answered that there are no symptoms associated with HIV infection that would make primary care physicians suspect the diagnosis. A significant majority of students could not name AIDS indicator diseases. To improve public health and quality of care for persons infected with HIV, it is necessary to better educate physicians-in-training about the clinical characteristics and transmission routes for HIV/AIDS, as well as approaches to discuss human sexuality and sexually transmitted infection prevention with patients."
7362,0.005,5.0,"Providers are central to effective implementation of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Primary care providers (PCP) and infectious disease physicians (ID) in the US Air Force (USAF) participated in a cross-sectional survey regarding knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward HIV PrEP. Characteristics associated with PrEP knowledge were assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses.Among 403 (40% of 1015 providers) participants, 9% (PCP 383, ID 20) ever prescribed PrEP. In univariate analysis, years in practice, number of HIV-infected patients treated in the past 12 months, past prescription of antiretrovirals for HIV prevention, frequency of prescribing PrEP in the past 12 months, and ever being questioned by a patient about PrEP were associated with PrEP knowledge (P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, providers who had ever prescribed antiretrovirals to prevent HIV (AOR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.27-4.42) had greater odds of high PrEP knowledge. Despite concerns about medication side effects (overall 67%: PCP 68%, ID 85%) and prescribing PrEP without clear evidence (overall 60%: PCP 65%, ID 62%), 64% (PCP 65%, ID 85%) of participants indicated PrEP should be offered in the Military Health System and 68% (PCP 70%, ID 100%) disagreed with the statement that their patient population was not at risk for HIV infection.Successful PrEP implementation in the USAF will require continued education and training of primary care providers to improve knowledge and mitigate concerns about PrEP.

9326,0.005,5.0,"The majority of vertical infections with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) occur at or near delivery, strongly suggesting a mucosal route of transmission. The frequency and level of intrapartum mucosal exposure to HIV-1 of 22 infants born to infected mothers was investigated. Maternal plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count were measured at delivery. Infant oropharyngeal aspirates obtained at birth were examined for HIV-1 RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and qualitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification. Nine infants (41%) had detectable levels of HIV-1 RNA, 3 of which were quantifiable (mean, 3000 copies/mL). This mucosal exposure to HIV-1 during delivery did not lead to infection of any infant. Cesarian delivery did not reduce mucosal exposure to HIV-1. Mucosal exposure did not correlate with maternal CD4 cell count but did correlate with maternal plasma virus load and was reduced by antiretroviral therapy."
1516,0.005,5.0,"To achieve global targets for universal treatment set forth by the Joint United Nations Programme on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (UNAIDS), viral load monitoring for HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) must become the standard of care in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) (1). CDC and other U.S. government agencies, as part of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, are supporting multiple countries in sub-Saharan Africa to change from the use of CD4 cell counts for monitoring of clinical response to ART to the use of viral load monitoring, which is the standard of care in developed countries. Viral load monitoring is the preferred method for immunologic monitoring because it enables earlier and more accurate detection of treatment failure before immunologic decline. This report highlights the initial successes and challenges of viral load monitoring in seven countries that have chosen to scale up viral load testing as a national monitoring strategy for patients on ART in response to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Countries initiating viral load scale-up in 2014 observed increases in coverage after scale-up, and countries initiating in 2015 are anticipating similar trends. However, in six of the seven countries, viral load testing coverage in 2015 remained below target levels. Inefficient specimen transport, need for training, delays in procurement and distribution, and limited financial resources to support scale-up hindered progress. Country commitment and effective partnerships are essential to address the financial, operational, technical, and policy challenges of the rising demand for viral load monitoring. "
6689,0.005,5.0,"One of the hallmarks of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes which precedes the progression from an asymptomatic state to AIDS. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is one of the mechanisms proposed to mediate this depletion. Infectious and inactivated preparations of HIV-1LAI were compared for their potential to induce apoptosis. Analysis with fluorescence-activated cell sorting using the DNA intercalative compound propidium iodide demonstrated that apoptosis occurred only with infectious HIV-1, implying that cell surface binding and signalling by the virus alone were insufficient to trigger apoptosis. Apoptosis was further confirmed by the presence of characteristic digestion of host cell DNA and morphologically by nuclear condensation observed by transmission electron microscopy. HIV infection of CD4+ T cell lines generated an accumulation of the cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and cells undergoing apoptosis appeared to originate from the pool of cells in the G1 phase. Inhibitors of HIV replication were used to identify the point in the virus replicative cycle at which apoptosis is induced. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ddI, or the HIV protease inhibitor, RO31-8959 (Saquinavir), were added either 2 h before or 6 h after HIV inoculation. Only ddI inhibited HIV-induced apoptosis when added before inoculation; however, neither treatment was effective in preventing HIV-induced apoptosis when applied 6 h after inoculation. These data indicate that apoptosis requires a single round of reverse transcription and the expression of virion proteins, but not the maturation of progeny virions. Two agents which compete with HIV for binding to CD4+ T cells, dextran sulphate and the anti-CD4 MAb Leu3a, were effective at preventing apoptosis when added 6 h after infection, implying that a subsequent gp120-CD4 interaction at the surface of an infected cell was required to complete the apoptotic process."
8192,0.005,5.0,"In a prospective cohort study of 265 laboratory and affiliated workers, one individual with no recognized risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was HIV-1 seropositive at the time of entry into the study. Molecular analyses of two HIV-1 isolates derived in two independent laboratories from a blood sample from this worker showed that the isolates were indistinguishable from a genotypic form of HIV-1 present in the H9/HTLV-IIIB cell line. Exposure to this strain of virus most probably occurred during work with concentrated virus or culture fluids from virus-producing cell lines under standard Biosafety Level 3 containment. Although no specific incident leading to this infection has been identified, undetected skin contact with virus culture supernatant might have occurred. This worker was the only one found to be positive among the subgroup of 99 workers who shared a work environment involving exposure to concentrated virus. The incidence rate of 0.48 per 100 person-years exposure indicates that prolonged laboratory exposure to concentrated virus is associated with some risk of HIV-1 infection, which is comparable to the risk for health care workers experiencing a needle stick exposure. While none of the ten workers with parenteral exposure to HIV-1 in this cohort became infected, a worker in another laboratory did seroconvert following an injury with a potentially contaminated needle. Strict Biosafety Level 3 containment and practices should be followed when working with concentrated HIV-1 preparations, and further refinement of the procedures may be necessary."
1761,0.005,5.0,"The sera from 16 individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at different clinical stages were evaluated for antibody-dependent neutralization and/or enhancement of infectivity by HIV. The HIV isolate from each individual (homotypic) and established laboratory strains showing broad cellular host range and cytopathicity were used. All sera could neutralize one of the laboratory-passaged isolates, whereas only two could neutralize the corresponding homotypic strain. Seven homotypic isolates were enhanced by serum from the respective individual. This activity was primarily observed in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Moreover, the tropism for macrophages of four of these seven viral isolates was found to be enhanced by the homotypic sera. Finally, sequential pairs of HIV and sera obtained from five HIV-infected individuals with different clinical progression were studied over time. The enhancing activity of three of the five sera appeared to increase over time, indicating changes in both the host virus population and the type of antibodies produced. These results suggest that enhancing antibodies contribute to the spread and pathogenesis of HIV in vivo. They emphasize the necessity of studying further the association of enhancing antibodies and disease progression in infected individuals."
3208,0.005,5.0,"While the expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa has reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV/AIDS, it has increased concern about drug resistance. The Microbicide Trials Network 009 study assessed the prevalence of drug-resistance mutations among women at clinical sites in Durban, South Africa who tested seropositive for HIV-1 at screening for the VOICE trial. The objective of this paper was to identify characteristics and behaviors associated with drug resistance. Factors found to be significantly associated with increased resistance were high perceived risk of getting HIV and prior participation in a microbicide trial, a likely proxy for familiarity with the health care system. Two factors were found to be significantly associated with reduced resistance: having a primary sex partner and testing negative for HIV in the past year. Other variables hypothesized to be important in identifying women with resistant virus, including partner or friend on ART who shared with the participant and being given antiretrovirals during pregnancy or labor, or the proxy variable-number of times given birth in a health facility-were not significantly associated. The small number of participants with resistant virus and the probable underreporting of sensitive behaviors likely affected our ability to construct a comprehensive profile of the type of HIV-positive women at greatest risk of developing resistance mutations.

2758,0.005,5.0,"The long-term feasibility of a drug conservation strategy that allows low-level viral replication is unknown. We performed a retrospective study of treated HIV-infected patients with stable detectable viral replication (<10000 copies/mL [low-level viremia]) and compared their clinical, virologic and immunologic courses with those of treated patients with undetectable viremia and viremia (>or=10000 copies/mL [high-level viremia]). Viral reverse transcriptase and protease genotype and HIV-specific CD4 T-cell responses were determined using patient-derived samples. Clinical and immunologic benefits were maintained in patients with partial virologic suppression (<or=10000 copies/mL). Although low-level viral replication under drug pressure led to the accumulation of resistance mutations in most subjects' viruses, most subjects retained susceptibility to drugs in >or=2 classes of antiretroviral medications. HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell immunity was detected in most subjects with low-level and undetectable viremia and may have a role in controlling viremia in the setting of partial suppression."
3126,0.005,5.0,"The aim of immune-based therapies in HIV infection is to enhance numbers and function of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes especially specific anti-HIV cellular immune responses in order to allow immune control of viral replication. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been extensively studied in phase II trials. Intermittent administration of subcutaneous IL-2 results in substantial increases in CD4 cell counts in most HIV-patients. Two large-scale phase III international studies are addressing the key remaining question of the clinical benefit associated with CD4 cell expansions in HIV-infected patients receiving IL-2. Other cytokines including interferon-alpha are currently under investigation in phase II trials. The goal of therapeutic immunizations is to enhance and broaden the immune system's ability to recognize HIV. Several vaccine candidates, also tested as immunogens for preventive vaccines, are currently studied in phase II trials in patients exhibiting viral suppression under highly active antiretroviral therapy. It has been demonstrated in rhesus monkeys'models that therapeutic immunizations can result in the induction of strong CD4 and CD8 responses associated with viral control and prevention of clinical AIDS, following challenge with a highly pathogenic strain of chimeric SIV-HIV. The clinical efficacy of immune-based strategies remains to be demonstrated in randomized controlled clinical trials. Participation of immune system to control of viral replication may allow simplification of antiretroviral treatment which results in long-term adverse effects having impact in life quality of persons living with HIV."
7683,0.005,5.0,"The T-cell-mediated immune response plays a crucial role in defense against hepatotropic viruses as well as in the pathogenesis of viral chronic hepatitides. However, very little is known about the role of specific T cells during hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in humans. In this study, the T-cell response to HDV in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers with HDV superinfection was investigated at different levels. Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation in response to a recombinant form of large hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) revealed that 8 of 30 patients studied (27%) specifically responded to HDAg. By employing synthetic peptides spanning the entire HDAg sequence, we found that T-cell recognition was directed against different antigenic determinants, with patient-to-patient variation in the pattern of response to peptides. Interestingly, all responders had signs of inactive HDV-induced disease, while none of the patients with active disease and none of the control subjects showed any significant proliferation. More accurate information about the specific T-cell response was obtained at the clonal level. A panel of HDAg-specific CD4+ T-cell clones from three HDV-infected individuals and fine-specificity analysis revealed that the clones tested individually recognized four epitopes corresponding to amino acids (aa) 26 to 41, 50 to 65, 66 to 81, or 106 to 121 of HDAg sequence. The study of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction revealed that peptides 50 to 65 and 106 to 121 were presented to specific T cells in association with multiple class II molecules. In addition, peptide 26 to 41 was efficiently generated after processing of HDAg through the endogenous processing pathway. Cytokine secretion analysis showed that all the CD4+ T-cell clones assayed were able to produce high levels of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), belonging either to T helper-1 (Th1) or Th0 subsets and that some of them were cytotoxic in a specific assay. This study provides the first evidence that detection of a specific T-cell response to HDAg in the peripheral blood of individuals with hepatitis delta is related to the decrease of HDV-induced disease activity. The HDAg epitopes identified here and particularly those recognized by CD4+ T cells in association with multiple major histocompatibility complex class II molecules may be potentially exploited for the preparation of a vaccine for prophylaxis and therapy of HDV infection."
6475,0.005,5.0,"Health care workers are exposed daily to blood borne injury and infection with a high risk of hepatitis B or C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. In the 1980s, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a set of protocols and guidelines known as standard precautions (SP) to prevent accidental transmission of pathogens. The SP should be followed for each intervention or delivery of care in order to protect health care workers from risks associated with contact with blood and other biological liquids. A survey was conducted in a Western Algerian university hospital to assess nurses' adherence to SP practices. A questionnaire was administered to 450 nurses in the hospital workplace setting. A field survey was also conducted in order to take into account the means and support available to the nurses in these hospital departments, namely to determine availability of hand washing and drying facilities. A total of 133 nurses, 81 women and 52 men, participated in the survey. Personal and professional data, hand-washing frequency, glove wearing practices were collected as data. A large majority (95%) of nurses reported washing their hands after removing their gloves, and 69% of them reported washing their hands between two patients. Male nurses wear gloves more often than females (respectively 77% and 53%). Sharp instruments were correctly disposed of in a puncture-resistant container more of the time. Recapping needles has been reported by two-thirds of survey respondents. Lack of liquid soap and alcohol-based washing solution were noted as major deficiencies as well as the lack of means to properly dry hands in many health care wards. Lack of SP adherence is primarily due to the lack of awareness and knowledge as well as insufficient supply of equipment and materials for good hand hygiene maintenance. This study highlights the urgent need to implement a programme to improve SP adherence among nurses and to increase the supply of hand washing and drying materials. Greater adherence to SP practices will also reduce the risk of occupational exposure to blood borne injury and infection."

He was admitted to our hospital for acute hepatitis caused by HBV. At that time, HIV-1antibody (Ab) was not detected in his serum. After 6 months, he was readmitted to our hospital for further examination of his liver because of confined liver enzyme abnormalities. Anti-HIV- Ab was detected in his serum by both enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) and particle agglutination (PA). His serum HIV-1 RNA level was 50 x 10(4) copies/ml and serum levels of HBV DNA polymerase (DNA-P) and HBV DNA were 6535cpm and 3 plus (>1000 copies/ml). His clinical course and laboratory data suggested progression from acute to chronic hepatitis related to coinfection with HIV-1. The diagnosis was chronic active hepatitis caused by HBV as an opportunistic infection due to coinfection with HIV-1. We began highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) because interferon (IFN) therapy was ineffective. HAART was started at an initial dosage of 600 mg zidovudine (AZT), 300 mg lamivudine (3TC), and 2400 mg indinavir (IDV) daily. After 4 weeks, the serum level of HBV DNA-polymerase (p) had decreased markedly to 37cpm and that of HIV-1 RNA had decreased to below the sensitivity threshold, indicating considerable suppression of the replication of these viruses by the treatment. But HBV DNA remained at low levels. Although the incidence of HBV infection in patients with HIV-1 infection has been reported to be high in the United States and Europe, simultaneous HBV and HIV-1 infection leading to persistent HBV infection is rare."

A convenience sample of 358 gay men was recruited in two gay bars. Exploratory factor analysis performed on the first split-half sample was used to assess the factor structure from five scales measuring beliefs about HBV vaccination. The scales were based on constructs from the health belief model and the social cognitive theory. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed on the remaining half-sample using structural equation modeling. Multivariable analysis further validated the scales. These findings propose standardized measures that may be useful in assessing the beliefs and attitudes of gay men toward HBV vaccination to guide intervention design and evaluation."
8836,0.005,5.0,"The prevalence of mutations in the precore and core promoter regions of hepatitis B virus DNA and the association with the hepatitis B e antigen-negative phenotype vary in different geographical areas. It is rather high especially in the Far East and Mediterranean countries. The mutations occurring in the precore and the minimal essential region of the core promoter of HBV-DNA were analyzed in the sera of 81 patients (HBeAg-positive, 47 patients; HBeAg-negative, 34 patients) with chronic hepatitis B virus infection by direct sequencing of amplified polymerase chain reaction products. All patients had thymine at nucleotide 1858. Seven of 47 HBeAg-positive patients (15%) and 29 of 34 HBeAg-negative patients (85%) had precore stop codon mutations (G to A change at nucleotide 1896). No nucleotide change was found in the minimal essential region of HBV core promoter in any patient studied. In conclusion, the hepatitis B e antigen-negative phenotype in Turkish patients with chronic hepatitis B is associated with mutations in the precore but not in the minimal essential region of the core promoter. These results representing a part of the eastern Mediterranean support the studies conducted for the other populations of the region."
8992,0.005,5.0,"A sensitive and accurate tuberculosis (TB) serodiagnostic test would aid in the control of TB, but results of current tests are relatively unreliable for persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We evaluated a new prototype immunochromatographic strip test and 5 commercially available serodiagnostic TB tests in a prospective study comprised of 465 consecutively enrolled patients with suspected TB from 2 hospitals in Botswana. Consenting adults underwent HIV testing, >/=2 sputum smears and cultures, and mycobacterial blood culture. Patients were defined as having TB on the basis of any positive smear or culture. Between January and September 2002, 465 of 498 consecutive patients consented to enrollment. A total of 384 patients (83%) were infected with HIV, and 175 (38%) had TB; the mycobacterial blood culture was the sole source of diagnosis for 26 patients (15%) with TB. Among the tests evaluated, the sensitivity was 0%-63%, the specificity was 39%-99%, the positive predictive value was 0%-39%, and the negative predictive value was 63%-65%. We conclude that the serodiagnostic tests evaluated in this study lacked sufficient sensitivity as sole tests for TB in this population."
2754,0.005,5.0,"Population genotyping (PG) can underestimate resistance if resistance-containing low abundance variants go undetected. PG and clonal analysis (CA) results were compared in virologic failures (VFs) from a 48-week clinical trial that evaluated once-daily fosamprenavir/ritonavir (FPV/r) 1400 mg/100 mg or atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) 300 mg/100 mg, each combined with tenofovir/emtricitabine, in antiretroviral-naive patients. VF was defined as confirmed HIV-1 RNA > or =400 copies/ml at > or =24 weeks or viral rebound >400 copies/ml any time following viral suppression. All patients had baseline PG. One hundred and six patients enrolled (53/arm). Baseline resistance mutations were more prevalent in patients receiving FPV/r (10/53) than ATV/r (3/53). Seven patients (7%) were VFs-four on FPV/r and three on ATV/r. In the four FPV/r-treated VFs, baseline HIV TAMs combinations and/or PI mutations were detected in one by PG at VF (RT: L210W + T215C; PR: M46I + L76V) and three others by CA alone (RT: L210W + T215Y; RT: M41L; RT: K65R + K70R; PR: I47V); all four had study drug-associated mutations (CA detecting more HIV-1 resistance mutations than PG). In the three ATV/r VFs, no baseline drug-associated mutations were detected by PG; for one patient CA detected RT: K65R; PR: I84V. Phylogenetic analysis revealed tight clustering for FPV/r-treated VFs with highly related clones, whereas HIV-1 from ATV/r-treated VFs had no outgrowth from baseline of low abundance resistance-containing variants. In conclusion, low-abundance HIV resistance-containing variants were detected in baseline samples from patients with VF. The archived viruses that reemerged under selection pressure and acquired additional mutations were found primarily in patients in the FPV/r arm. Despite this and a baseline resistance imbalance between the two arms, FPV/r and ATV/r provided similar virologic suppression through 48 weeks; however, these findings highlight the necessity for the development of quick and inexpensive methods for detection of minority species to better guide therapy selection."
9162,0.005,5.0,"We present health and demographic surveillance system data to assess associations with health care utilization and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) service receipt in a high HIV prevalence area of western Kenya. Eighty-six percent of 15,302 residents indicated a facility/clinician for routine medical services; 60% reported active (within the past year) attendance. Only 34% reported a previous HIV test, and self-reported HIV prevalence was 6%. Active attendees lived only slightly closer to their reported service site (2.8 versus 3.1 km; P < 0.001) compared with inactive attendees. Multivariate analysis showed that younger respondents (< 30 years of age) and active and inactive attendees were more likely to report an HIV test compared with non-attendees; men were less likely to report HIV testing. Despite traveling farther for HIV services (median distance = 4.4 km), 77% of those disclosing HIV infection reported HIV care enrollment. Men and younger respondents were less likely to enroll in HIV care. Socioeconomic status was not associated with HIV service use. Distance did not appear to be the major barrier to service receipt. The health and demographic surveillance system data identified patterns of service use that are useful for future program planning."
8675,0.005,5.0,"In response to the confirmed transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from a surgeon to several patients in the Netherlands, a 'Committee for Prevention of Iatrogenic Hepatitis B' was established in 2000. During the years 2000-2008, the committee reviewed 99 cases of HBV-infected health care workers. Fifty of them were found to perform exposure prone procedures (EPPs). Because of high levels of HBV DNA (>100,000 copies/ml), a ban on performing EPPs was applied in 11/50 cases; 25/50 low-viremic health care workers were allowed to continue EPPs while their HBV load was being monitored; and 14/50 cases had stopped working or changed profession. In five restricted workers who started oral antiviral treatment, HBV replication was persistently suppressed, enabling the ban on EPPs to be lifted. Throughout the European Union different levels of HBV viremia have been chosen, above which health care workers are not allowed to perform EPPs. It remains unknown how this affects the safety of patients. Application in the Netherlands of a European or a British guideline would have, respectively, doubled or tripled the number of restricted health care workers."
8709,0.005,5.0,"The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with HIV infection among specific population subgroups and complement the HIV surveillance system in Cameroon. Five subgroups (truck drivers, female-sex-workers, university students, health service providers, and residents along Chad-Cameroon petroleum pipeline) were targeted in 2004. Potential participants were approached at their geographically diverse areas and consented to participate in the study. Anonymous blood samples were collected. 4,011 participants were surveyed (35% students, 25% sex-workers, 20% pipeline residents, 12.5% health service providers, 7.5% truck drivers). HIV prevalence was highest among sex-workers [26.4%, (95% CI, 23.6-29.2)], pipeline residents [19.9% (95% CI, 17.1-22.7)] and truck drivers [16.3% (95% CI, 12.3-20.9)] and lowest among health service providers [5.2% (95% CI, 3.4-7.5)] and university students [3.8% (95% CI, 2.9-5.0)]. Risky sexual behaviours were practiced in all subpopulations. Multivariable analysis shows in female-sex-workers that; older age, residing in the grassland region (Northwest and West Provinces) and inconstant condom use were significantly associated with HIV infection. Despite a moderate HIV prevalence in the general Cameroonian population, some subgroups are at much higher risk for HIV transmission and practicing risky sexual behaviours. There is need for expanded prevention and care programs with emphasis on truck drivers, sex-workers and pipeline residents."
2619,0.005,5.0,"The antiretroviral chemotherapy helps to reduce the mortality of HIVs infected patients. However, RNA dependant virus replication has a high mutation rate. Human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 protease plays an essential role in viral replication cycle. This protein is an important target for therapy with viral protein inhibitors. There are few works using normal mode analysis to investigate this problem from the structural changes viewpoint. The investigation of protein flexibility may be important for the study of processes associated with conformational changes and state transitions. The normal mode analysis allowed us to investigate structural changes in the protease (such as flexibility) in a straightforward way and try to associate these changes with the increase of fitness for each positively selected HIV-1 mutant protease of patients treated with several protease inhibitors (saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, fosamprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, and tripanavir) in combination or separately. These positively selected mutations introduce significant flexibility in important regions such as the active site cavity and flaps. These mutations were also able to cause changes in accessible solvent area. This study showed that the majority of HIV-1 protease mutants can be grouped into two main classes of protein flexibility behavior. We presented a new approach to study structural changes caused by positively selected mutations in a pathogen protein, for instance the HIV-1 protease and their relationship with their resistance mechanism against known inhibitors. The method can be applied to any pharmaceutically relevant pathogen proteins and could be very useful to understand the effects of positively selected mutations in the context of structural changes."
5566,0.005,5.0,"Early studies of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use in clinical practice suggested suboptimal rates of viral suppression. HAART regimens and expertise in the use of HAART have since evolved, and we sought to determine how virologic response to HAART has changed in clinical practice. We compared all patients who started a first HAART regimen from 1996 through 2002 in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected patients in care in Baltimore. There were significant improvements in suppressing HIV RNA to < 400 copies/mL, ranging from 43.8% (1996) to 72.4% (2001-2002) by 6 months and from 60.1% (1996) to 79.9% (2001-2002) by 12 months (both P < 0.01 for trend). There were also significant improvements in CD4 cell response. Over time, there was a significant increase in the use of a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimen compared with a single PI as well as an increase in the number of patients who were antiretroviral (ARV) naive. There was also a significant temporal trend from 1996 through 2002 in achieving a suppressed HIV RNA level, adjusting for being ARV naive, specific HAART regimen, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA level, and demographic factors. This suggests that improved virologic response may also be attributable to other factors such as a greater focus on medication adherence, improved ARV tolerability, and ease of dosing."
8438,0.005,5.0,"In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy era, medication adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) have become critical issues for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). The purpose of this study was to test explanatory models of how patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction are related to medication adherence and HRQOL for PLWH. A total of 344 PLWH receiving health-care services from a federally funded clinic in the southwest USA completed a survey questionnaire about their perception of interactions with providers, their satisfaction with services, their medication adherence, and their HRQOL. Comparing four latent variable structural equation models of direct and mediated effects of patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction, the findings illustrate that the best model is one in which patient-provider interaction has a direct and positive effect on patient satisfaction, medication adherence, and HRQOL. These findings suggest that quality patient-provider interaction is a critical element of health-care services for PLWH, while patient satisfaction is an outcome measure and not a mediating factor for medication adherence and HRQOL.

3505,0.005,5.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) is entering into its third decade affecting more than 40 million persons on the plane, with an extraordinary incidence in the underdeveloped world, especially in the African continent where more than 25 million are affected, with more than 3 million new yearly infections and where the life expectancy is at 47 years. Although the vaccination is still far away, the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy in the middle of the 90's was an important advance that contributed to converting an infection that previously had a very high rate of short-term mortality into a chronic disease. The neurological complications of this infection vary enormously. They affect any location of the neuroaxis and can appear at any stage of infection. It is not rare that more than one neurological complication exists. Such complications may be a consequence of the infection itself (primary) or related with immune depression accompanying it (secondary). Among the former, dementia associated to HIV and peripheral polyneuropathy stand out. Among the latter, opportunistic viral and fungal infections and lymphoma of the nervous systems stand out. In recent years different tests that help to establish the diagnoses of these entities have been developed, a necessary step to initiate adequate therapies. The immune state of the patient, reflected by the peripheral count of CD4 lymphocytes and serum viral load, helps us to establish the most likely causes of the neurological problems that appear in the context of this infection. We briefly review the most outstanding characteristics of each one of them in this work."
110,0.005,5.0,"A variant of hepatitis B virus (HBV) having a specific mutation within the S gene has been found to infect vaccinees. To know whether similar variants were involved in Japan, we analyzed two cases of maternal transmission of HBV in infants immunized with hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine. DNA clones of HBV S genes were propagated from patients and family members and sequenced. In one family, the DNA clones from the baby patient had a Gly-to-Arg mutation at the 145th codon of the S gene, whereas those from her mother had no such mutations. In the other family, all the DNA clones obtained from the two infected children had the 145th codon intact, but they had a missense mutation at the 126th codon of the S gene, causing an amino acid substitution of Asn for Thr or Ile. This same mutation was observed in 12 of 17 clones of DNA obtained from their mother. In comparison with the wild type HBV-derived hepatitis B surface antigen, the two types of S gene mutations, either at the 145th or the 126th codon, were associated with a significant decrease in the antigenicity of some determinants on the hepatitis B surface antigen, measured by MAb. Amino acid substitution at these sites, therefore, would have induced the escape from conventional vaccines that were S gene products of wild type HBV and also from hepatitis B immune globulin, whose main components were probably also antibodies against the S gene products expressed by wild type HBV."
6768,0.005,5.0,"Cases of tuberculosis identified during 1992-1994 through an active tuberculosis surveillance network among six hospitals that serve New York City (the TBNetwork) were analyzed according to the occupational status of the patients. Clinical data were obtained by review of medical records, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was performed. No known nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred at these hospitals in the study period. Occupational status was known for 142 of 201 patients whose isolates were available for strain typing. Patients infected by organisms with a clustered strain typing pattern, as determined by RFLP analysis, were presumed to have recently acquired disease. RFLP typing revealed that isolates from 13 (65%) of 20 health care workers and 50 (41%) of 122 non-health care workers had a clustered RFLP pattern. The strains infecting eight (89%) of nine health care workers seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had a clustered RFLP pattern. Multivariate analysis of 75 patients with known HIV and occupational status revealed that HIV status (P = .03) and health care worker status (P = .02; RR = 2.77) were independent risk factors for a clustered RFLP strain. These findings suggest that many of the apparently sporadic cases of tuberculosis among health care workers may be due to unrecognized occupational transmission."
8165,0.005,5.0,"Over the last few years, a relative decline of the morbidity and mortality of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in industrialised countries has been observed due to the use of a potent combined therapy known as high active antiretroviral therapies (HAARTs). It has led to a decrease of viral load and a quantitative and qualitative improvement of immune function in patients, especially CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, having as a consequence a decrease of infectious complications and a global clinical improvement. Besides the positive effects of HAARTs on immune and metabolic alterations during HIV infection, it has been reported that the commonly used drugs AZT, ddI, and ddC are toxic to hepatocytes. Recent reports continue to point to the mitochondria as targets for toxicity. The prevalence of these symptoms is continued during acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The effects of oxidative stress occurring as a consequence of mitochondrial toxicity may amplify some of the pathophysiological and phenotypic events during infection. Mitochondrial stabilisation and antioxidative strategies are possible new therapeutic aims since the antiretroviral treatment is prolonged with increased longevity from AIDS, which has become a more manageable chronic illness. The aim of the present review article is to summarize the current knowledge about mitochondrial dysfunction during HAART and its consequence for patients with chronic treatment. Oxidative stress may serve as one pathway for cellular damage in AIDS and its treatment. One important future goal is to prevent or attenuate the side effects of HAART so that improved disease management can be achieved."
7435,0.005,5.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) share overlapping, large worldwide distribution. The implications of coinfection are being explored because of the importance of these viruses and demographic factors that favor coinfection. The nervous system is affected by HIV in a variety of ways resulting in significant disease of all levels of the nervous system. Emerging evidence that HCV can also impact the nervous system raises concerns that detrimental interactions might occur. Several reports addressing the manifestations of coinfection support independent contributions for both HIV and HCV on central nervous system performance, but not on distal sensory neuropathy. Neuropsychological testing reveals independent contributions resulting in poorer performance in coinfection in several drug-abusing cohorts. Motor physiologic testing substantiates performance deficits from HCV in coinfected subjects as does testing in treatment naive coinfected subjects. Although ongoing deficits attributed to HCV may be seen during HIV treatment, these deficits may be less apparent in advanced HIV disease. Current evidence supports independent contributions of HCV and HIV to neurological impairment. Preliminary evidence suggests that coinfection-related impairment does not appear to accelerate HIV-1-associated cognitive disease."
854,0.005,5.0,"As the incidence of HIV increases, one of the major steps in preventing a widespread epidemic is to make certain that medical students are prepared to recognize and treat HIV infections and their related conditions, and to counsel patients about avoiding risks that might lead to infections. This cross-sectional study assessed the knowledge level of 357 medical students and their attitudes about AIDS and HIV enrolled in a Medical College in Karachi, Pakistan. Only 6% of the students had complete knowledge on symptoms of HIV/AIDS and 7% of the students had complete knowledge on the modes of transmission of HIV. Statistical analysis of demographic factors affecting knowledge was done. Linear regression and Maentel-Haenszel tests showed that older and clinical students were more knowledgeable of symptoms and modes of transmission of HIV/AIDS. Ten attitudes were correlated with knowledge and none of these showed an association. These results on knowledge indicate that education about HIV/AIDS should be incorporated in the curriculum and interventions must be taken by public health professionals to avoid poor treatment outcomes."
7695,0.005,5.0,"Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy is an important intervention to prevent the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV and to promote maternal health. Early initiation of ART is particularly important to achieve viral suppression rapidly before delivery. However, current approaches to start ART in pregnancy may be problematic in many settings, with referrals between antenatal care (ANC) and ART services, and delays for patient preparation before ART initiation. These steps contribute to a sizable proportion of women failing to receive adequate duration of ART before delivery, increasing the risk of MTCT. To address these limitations, we developed the rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy (RAP) programme. The programme featured the use of point-of-care CD4 testing to identify ART-eligible women with CD4 cell counts ≤ 350 cells/µl; immediate ART initiation in women on the same day that eligibility was determined, if possible; and intensive counselling and support for ART initiation during the first few weeks on ART. We implemented RAP in an antenatal clinic setting in Cape Town South Africa. Between February and August 2011, a total of 221 HIV-infected women were referred to the programme for CD4 cell count testing and 101 (46%) were eligible for ART. Of these, 98 women (97%) started therapy during pregnancy, 89 (91%) on the day of referral to the service. In-depth interviews suggested that although there were substantial challenges facing HIV-infected women initiating ART in pregnancy, the availability of immediate services and counselling support played an important role in addressing these. While further research is needed, this evaluation demonstrates that a novel service delivery approach may facilitate rapid ART initiation in pregnancy."
2072,0.005,5.0,"This qualitative, exploratory study investigated knowledge about perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and perceptions of the childbearing role among women at risk for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) through injection drug use. Content analysis was used to analyze the results of 21 face-to-face, semistructured interviews with women who had a personal history of injection drug use or who were the sexual partners of men who injected drugs. Contextual variables influencing women at risk for HIV infection that were identified included fear of HIV antibody testing, a belief that perinatal HIV transmission is inevitable, support for pregnancy termination in the event of HIV-associated pregnancy, a strong desire for children, pride in mothering behavior, and guilt about the possibility of transmitting HIV to unborn children. AIDS education and counseling for these women will be most effective if these variables are considered."
3776,0.005,5.0,"Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) are the main genes that control cell death in the immune system. Indeed, they are crucial for the regulation of T lymphocyte homeostasis because they can influence cell proliferation. A strong debate exists on the importance of Fas/FasL system during HIV infection, which is characterized by the loss of CD4+ T cells directly, or indirectly, caused by the virus. To investigate whether the genetic background of the host plays a role in the immunoreconstitution, we studied the influence of different Fas and FasL polymorphisms on CD4+ T lymphocyte count and plasma viral load following initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in drug-naïve HIV+ patients. We studied 131 individuals, who were compared to 136 healthy donors. Statistical analysis was performed by using Chi2 test, Fischer's Exact Test, and analysis for repeated measurements. The group of HIV+ patients had an unexpected lower frequency of FasLnt169 polymorphism (delT allele) than healthy controls (p = 0.039). We then observed no significant differences in the immune reconstitution, in terms of CD4+ T cell increase, when the influence of single alleles of the gene Fas or FasL was considered. However, the combination of some polymorphisms of Fas or FasL significantly influenced CD4+ T cell production and viral load decrease, showing that these genes can play a role in the immunoreconstitution triggered by antiretroviral therapy."
2794,0.005,5.0,"An increased incidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported among human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients or those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Despite this association, hitherto only a single case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported in an HIV-infected patient during pregnancy. We describe a young multiparous patient with long-standing AIDS who presented with lower abdominal pain. Following findings of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, low-grade fever, and mental status changes, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was diagnosed after initially considering the diagnosis of severe preeclampsia, and the patient was delivered by cesarean section. The patient required multiple plasma exchanges during a protracted postpartum course, and was discharged in good health. This first report of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and AIDS in pregnancy demonstrates that when encountering preeclampsia in patients with AIDS, thrombotic microangiopathy should be strongly considered. In addition, these patients may exhibit an attenuated response to plasma exchange therapy and despite previous reports in nonobstetric patients, a favorable outcome is attainable in these critically ill patients."
1312,0.005,5.0,"As health-care services in Nigeria and other African countries are becoming overstrained with patients, home-based care has increasingly been touted as a possible solution. The faith-based organisation, Gospel Health and Development Services, provides a home-based care programme for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) residing in Plateau State, Nigeria. This paper assesses the challenges that PLWHA in the programme faced while maintaining their health and livelihoods. The frustrations that volunteers endured in performing their work are also described, as well as the benefits and weaknesses of the programme from the perspective of PLWHA and their volunteer caregivers. Focus groups and interviews were done with 30 PLWHA and 22 volunteers to learn about their experiences with the home-based care programme and possible areas for its improvement. From these discussions three major challenges facing PLWHA emerged: discrimination towards PLWHA; the lack of money, food, and transport to health-care centres; and the desire for closer antiretroviral drug access."

9811,0.005,5.0,"Resistance to antiretroviral drugs remains an important limitation to successful human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) therapy. Resistance testing can improve treatment outcomes for infected individuals. The availability of new drugs from various classes, standardization of resistance assays, and the development of viral tropism tests necessitate new guidelines for resistance testing. The International AIDS Society-USA convened a panel of physicians and scientists with expertise in drug-resistant HIV-1, drug management, and patient care to review recently published data and presentations at scientific conferences and to provide updated recommendations. Whenever possible, resistance testing is recommended at the time of HIV infection diagnosis as part of the initial comprehensive patient assessment, as well as in all cases of virologic failure. Tropism testing is recommended whenever the use of chemokine receptor 5 antagonists is contemplated. As the roll out of antiretroviral therapy continues in developing countries, drug resistance monitoring for both subtype B and non-subtype B strains of HIV will become increasingly important."
9004,0.005,5.0,"Hepatitis B infection (HBV) is prevalent worldwide. Overall prevalence is about 3 percent in Bangladesh. Treatments of chronic HBV infection by antiviral drugs are costly and outcome of treatment is also restricted. Therefore risk factors identification is the logical & rational approach to prevent HBV infection. This case control study aimed to find out certain risk factors related to HBV infection in children. It was conducted on patients attending the Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition and Department of Virology of BSMMU and Khidmah Hospital, Dhaka. A total of one hundred cases and one hundred suitably matched controls were studied between October 2007 to May 2009.Variables used for the purpose of the study were younger age,  use of mosquito nets, history of undergoing surgical procedures, history of taking intravenous drug and blood transfusion, maternal infection, dental procedures and abrasion during hair cut in barber shops. Chi-square test   was done to measure the level of significance. Odds ratio was calculated to correlate the disease risk. Backward conditional logistic regression was also done for multivariate analysis. The study result showed that the frequency of HBV infection among the study population was higher (62.0%) among children of 7 to 12 years age group. In younger age group (0-6 years) prevalence was 18.0%. Respondents who did not use mosquito net during sleep on a regular basis had higher risk of developing HBV infection than those who used it regularly (p value 0.028). Children who underwent surgical procedures for any reason were significantly associated with HBV infection (p value 0.005). Intravenous drug use (p value 0.001), mother to child transmission (p value 0.001) and history of abrasion during hair cut in barber shops (p value 0.04) were also identified as significant risk factors. No significant association was observed with blood transfusion (p value 0.138) and dental procedures (p value 0.315). From this study it may be concluded that irregular use of mosquito nets, history of surgical procedures, history of parenteral medication, transmission from infected mothers and abrasion during hair cut in barber shops are the probable important risk factors of HBV infection in children."

3010,0.005,5.0,"Patients coinfected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were studied with regard to nucleotide sequence variability in the E2/NS1 first hypervariable region of the HCV genome. The nucleotide variability within individual patients was compared to patients infected only with HCV. The proportion of predicted synonymous and nonsynonymous amino acid changes, and the relationship to putative high-antigenicity sites, were evaluated in the hypervariable envelope domain. Ninety-one clones from 10 patients with HCV/HIV coinfection were sequenced, following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the hypervariable region. The control HCV group included 53 clones from 7 patients. Sequence analysis encompassed the region coding for amino acids 384 to 414. Consensus sequences from each patient were used as the internal standard for nonsynonymous amino acid codon variability. Cumulative proportional comparison at each amino acid site revealed increased variability in HCV RNA from patients with HCV/HIV coinfection versus HCV alone (P < .05). The greatest variability was observed at amino acids 386, 397, 400, 402, 405, 407, and 414, with >l0 percent clonal variation at these sites. Jameson-Wolf plots were used to predict putative high-antigenicity domains. Nonsynonymous clonal variation resulted in alteration of putative antigenic sites within the hypervariable region. All clones had at least one high-probability site. Clones with unique predicted antigenic domains were observed more frequently in HIV/HCV coinfected patients, and, independent of viral titer, were consistent with increased sequence variability. These data suggest an accumulation of envelope variants in the HCV/HIV coinfected patients, which could be related to ineffective viral clearance, and may help explain prior reports of interferon (IFN) resistance in this patient group."
2120,0.005,5.0,"Mutations in the precore region of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been associated with failure of expression of HBV e-antigen (HBeAg), however, the prevalence of these and other mutations in HBV carriers without overt chronic liver disease remains uncertain. Homosexual or bisexual males (n = 65) with chronic HBV infection attending The Middlesex Hospital, London were studied, of whom two had clinical evidence of chronic liver disease. HBV DNA was amplified from 62 of 65 serum samples using nested and double nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Direct sequencing of the PCR products was employed to investigate sequence variation. HBV-DNA from all available HBeAg-negative (n = 9) and selected HBeAg-positive (n = 33) sera were sequenced in the entire precore gene, the 3' terminal portion of the X gene (aa128-154), and the 5' terminus of the core gene (aa18-73). Sequences were highly conserved in all regions studied. Samples from two anti-HBe-seropositive patients contained mutations in the precore region. In one, a single mutation in the first amino acid resulted in a change to leucine, which would prevent translation of this region and therefore HBeAg expression. Wild type sequences were also detected in this sample. In the other sample from a patient with overt chronic liver disease, a mutation of precore amino acid 28 changed a tryptophan residue to a stop codon which would also prevent HBeAg expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3642,0.005,5.0,"We conducted a large-scale survey to determine the frequency and clinical significance of mutations in the pre-core region of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sera from 263 patients with chronic HBV infection were analyzed by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified HBV DNA. Four major missense/nonsense mutations (M) were found: (M1) C-->T at nucleotide position 1856, Pro-->Ser at codon 15; (M2) G-->A at position 1896, Trp-->stop at codon 28; (M3) G-->A at position 1898, Gly-->Ser at codon 29; and (M4) G-->A at position 1899, Gly-->Asp at codon 29. The commonest conserved mutation was M0: T-->C at position 1858, Pro-->Pro at codon 15. We found that M1 and M2 were mutually exclusive, M3 was only found in association with M1, and M4 was predominantly found in association with M2. All patients with M1 but none of those with M2 had M0. The invariable coexistence of certain mutations in codon 15 and codons 28 and 29 and the mutual exclusion of other mutations in these two noncontiguous regions is related to the stem-loop structure of the pre-genome encapsidation sequence located in the precore/core region. M2 and M4 enhance the stability of the stem by providing two additional paired sites. M1 destroys an existing base pair. However, M1 only occurred in the presence of M0, which provides an extra paired site, and 50% of patients with M1 had M3, a compensatory mutation that restores base pairing at this site. Our data support the proposed secondary structure of the pre-genome encapsidation sequence. The primary function of the mutations in the pre-core region is to enhance stability of this secondary structure to ensure perpetuation of viral replication."
9973,0.005,5.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection affects approximately 375 million people worldwide. Current antiviral treatment effectively controls, but rarely clears chronic HBV infection. In addition, a significant portion of chronic HBV infected patients are not suitable for currently available antiviral therapy, and still face higher risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The poorly understood pathogenesis of HBV infection is the main barrier for developing more effective treatment strategies. HBV has long been viewed as non-cytopathic and the central hypothesis for HBV pathogenesis lies in the belief that hepatitis B is a host specific immunity-mediated liver disease. However, this view has been challenged by the accumulating experimental and clinical data that support a model of cytopathic HBV replication. In this article we systematically review the pathogenic role of HBV replication in hepatitis B and suggest possible HBV replication related mechanisms for HBV-mediated liver injury. We propose that a full understanding of HBV pathogenesis should consider the following elements. I. Liver injury can be caused by high levels of HBV replication and accumulation of viral products in the infected hepatocytes. II. HBV infection can be either directly cytopathic, non-cytopathic, or a mix of both in an individual patient depending upon accumulation levels of viral products that are usually associated with HBV replication activity in individual infected hepatocytes."

Six hundred seventy-nine IDUs were recruited from October 2002 through June 2004. Participants completed questionnaires to elicit demographic, drug and sex risk information, and were tested for hepatitis A, B, C and HIV.A linear regression model predicting the total number of infections (0 to 4 possible) was constructed. Significant associations were found between HAV and HBV infection, HAV and HCV infection, and HBV and HCV infection. Predictors of total co-infections included age of first injection, lifetime years in jail, and Hispanic ethnicity. Latinos had the highest proportion of HAV and HBV co-infection with HCV. The total number of co-infections, especially those co-infected with all three of the hepatitis infections, was unexpectedly high."

The lack of public programs for prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment contribute to the increase in the incidence and prevalence of diseases in general and especially sexually transmitted diseases. This article aims to estimate the prevalence of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and syphilis among inmates at the Women's Penitentiary in the State capital of São Paulo, Brazil. All inmates were invited to participate in the study, which was divided into two stages: 1. STD/AIDS preventive workshops including interviews and 2. laboratory tests. The interview covered knowledge of STD/AIDS, risk behavior, and individual reproductive health history. A total of 262 women, with a mean age of 32.4 years and limited schooling, participated in more than one stage of the study. Prevalence rates were 14.5% for HIV, 16.3% for high-oncogenic-risk HPV probes, 4.8% for low-oncogenic-risk HPV probes, and 5.7% for syphilis. The authors conclude that STD/HIV constitute a serious health problem in the prison system, requiring urgent preventive measures."
9302,0.005,5.0,"Both HCV and HIV are common in haemophiliacs previously treated with non-viral-inactivated clotting factor concentrates. Because of increased bleeding risks, little data are available on the safety of percutaneous outpatient liver biopsy (LBx) and impact of HIV coinfection in this population. This study aims at reporting our experience with percutaneous LBx in a cohort of haemophiliacs infected with HCV and describe the spectrum of disease and impact of HIV coinfection. A retrospective review of consecutive patients with haemophilia and HCV who underwent percutaneous LBx was performed. All patients were positive for HCV RNA by commercial assay and received factor concentrate prior to biopsy. A total of 29 male patients (mean age 36, 24 haemophilia A, five haemophilia B, and 44% coinfected with HIV) underwent successful outpatient percutaneous LBx without bleeding complication. Histologic activity index was 6.44 with advanced fibrosis (bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis) in 31%. When patients were stratified by HIV positive (n = 13) vs. HIV negative (n = 16), coinfected patients had higher fibrosis scores and higher proportion advanced fibrosis (54% vs. 12%; P = 0.0167) with no differences in age, demographic or other laboratory parameters. Multivariate logistic regression found that HIV positivity was independently associated with advanced fibrosis (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.17-11.8; P = 0.026). Outpatient percutaneous LBx can be safely performed in patients with haemophilia. Despite similar age, HIV coinfection was an independent predictor of advanced fibrosis. These data support the hypothesis that HIV accelerates fibrosis progression in those coinfected with HCV and highlights the importance of liver histology in this population."
1140,0.005,5.0,"To better understand patient beliefs, which may influence adherence to HIV care and treatment, we examined three dimensions of beliefs among Ethiopian adults (n = 1177) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). Beliefs about benefits of ART/HIV clinical care were largely accurate, but few patients believed in the ability of ART to prevent sexual transmission and many thought Holy Water could cure HIV. Factors associated with lower odds of accurate beliefs included advanced HIV, lack of formal education, and Muslim religion (benefits of ART/clinical care); secondary or university education and more clinic visits (ART to prevent sexual transmission); and pregnancy and Orthodox Christian religion (Holy Water). Assessment of patient beliefs may help providers identify areas needing reinforcement. In this setting, counselors also need to stress the benefits of ART as prevention and that Holy Water should not be used to the exclusion of HIV care and ART."

Similar to previous reports of hyperthyroidism due to IRD, all of our patients experienced a rapid early recovery in total CD4 count, but developed symptoms of hyperthyroidism on average 3 years (38 months) after beginning cART, which represents a longer time frame than previously reported. Awareness and recognition of this potential complication of cART, which may occur years after treatment initiation, will allow patients with immune restorative hyperthyroidism to receive timely therapy and avoid the long-term complications associated with undiagnosed thyroid disease."
4098,0.005,5.0,"Although highly active antiretroviral therapy has improved survivorship dramatically and decreased the incidence of cytomegalovirus retinitis among patients with AIDS, other ophthalmic complications continue to occur. One complication observed in approximately 12% of HIV-infected patients is a presumed neuroretinal disorder (NRD), manifested as decreased contrast sensitivity and associated with vague subjective complaints of hazy vision. Pathologically, patients with AIDS even without ocular opportunistic infections have loss of optic nerve axons, suggestive of mitochondrial dysfunction. We explored whether variation in mitochondrial DNA was associated with time to NRD in HIV-infected patients in the Longitudinal Study of Ocular Complications of AIDS cohort. Within the Western European, or ""N"", mitochondrial DNA macrohaplogroup, haplogroup J, was associated with 80% decrease in the risk of progression to NRD during the study (hazard ratio = 0.20, P = 0.039) and suggested an independent association with protection against NRD in a cross-section of all patients taken at enrollment (1.5% vs. 8.9% in patients with vs. without haplogroup J, respectively, P = 0.05). These data suggest that mitochondrial genotype may influence propensity to develop HIV-associated NRD in patients with AIDS."
4421,0.005,5.0,"It is estimated that approximately 3% of the world population are chronically infected with HCV, as the annual incidence of HCV infection is approximately 3-4 million people. Despite all efforts made to eradicate the HCV infection, after the standard therapy (PegIFN and ribavirin for 48 weeks) only 40-50% of the HCV infected individuals with genotype 1 achieve sustained virological response (SVR). Since our goal today is the eradication of HCV infection, our prior concern has become the identification of predictor factors concerning treatment response. Recent studies such as GWAS have been concerned with the genetic factors and the response to treatment. Recently all interest has been turned towards the demonstration of the host polymorphism located upstream of the IL-28B gene and which is associated with sustained virological response to treatment with pegylated interferon Alfa in combination with ribavirin. Although 2011 comes with the FDA approval of the new triple therapy associating telaprevir/ boceprevir to the standard therapy, a new ethical concern regarding the high costs of this treatment rises the problem of who is the first in line? This is just the beginning of a new quest to further investigate the relationship between the host's polymorphism of the IL-28 gene and the standard and triple therapy in HCV infected individuals in achieving SVR as well as who should receive standard or triple therapy. Determination of the IL-28 polymorphisms may be used together with clinical assessment in order to evaluate patients and to personalize their treatment. The purpose of this paper is to underline the main concerns regarding the goal and endpoints of the HCV therapy, and the relationship of IL-28 in achieving sustained virological response, as well as in pointing out the importance to determine prior to initiating treatment the polymorphism of IL-28 since it is a strong predictor. This is important because it will increase the chances to achieve SVR, it will be cost-effective and reduces adverse effects."
6050,0.005,5.0,"Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus infection are the most important infections transmitted by the parenteral route in hemodialysis patients. This study is the first report of prevalence of viral hepatitis and hepatitis C virus genotypes in southwest Iran among hemodialysis patients. A cross-sectional study was carried out among 214 hemodialysis patients of the Central hemodialysis unit, from March 2005 to August 2006. Serum samples were tested for HBsAg and anti-HCV using specific enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) kits and confirmed by PCR (HBV) and RT PCR (HCV). HCV genotypes were determined with HCV genotype specific primers using HCV genotype kit. Out of 214 hemodialysis patients, 34 were positive for anti-HCV (7.9%, 95% CI: 4.32-11.56) and 11 for HBsAg (5.1%, 95% CI: 2.18-8.1). The duration of treatment by hemo-dialysis was significantly associated with HBV and HCV positivity (P< 0.001). The predominant HCV genotype in the region was 1a (41.1%, 7/17), whilst genotypes 3a and 1b were found in 35.2% (6/17) and 23.5% (4/17) subjects, respectively. In conclusion although anti-HCV and HBsAg positivity in hemodialysis patients in Khuzestan province are smaller than those found in some other Iranian provinces and neighboring countries, they are still high. Enforcement of universal precautions in infection control, routine testing of patients, and serial determination of hepatic enzymes should be the common practice in dialysis centers in Iran."
9745,0.005,5.0,"We conducted a survey of a random sample of California orthodontists and of general dentists to compare their infection control procedures. Questionnaires were returned by 124 orthodontists (56% response rate) and 126 general dentists (61% response rate). Eighteen questions were asked covering practice profile, perception of risk from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), exposure to blood, barrier protection used, and sterilization and disinfection procedures. Gloves always were worn by 80% of the orthodontists sampled, 63% always wore glasses, and 59% changed gloves between patients. Orthodontists sterilized their instruments 66% of the time and pliers 49% of the time. Compared with general dentists, orthodontists' perception of risk, use of barrier protection, and sterilization and disinfection procedures were lower in all areas. Our data suggest that poorer performance may be because orthodontists: (1) perceive their younger population of patients at less risk for HBV and HIV; (2) treat 2.5 times as many patients, which increases the costs of infection control; (3) do not use invasive procedures; and (4) perceive that glove use decreases dexterity. Orthodontists should follow the American Dental Association/Council on Dental Therapeutics infection control guidelines for universal precautions. To meet these guidelines, orthodontists still need improvement in all aspects of their infection control procedures."
2577,0.005,5.0,"As a result of the potent drug combinations of reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors currently available, it is now possible to achieve extreme reductions in the numbers of viral particles in the peripheral blood of HIV-positive patients undergoing treatment, to the point that they are undetectable. Moreover, the immunological recovery resulting from continued and prolonged use of these drugs significantly reduces both mortality and the incidence of opportunistic infections. However, the strict therapeutic regimens required, the number of pills, adverse events and the stigma of a disease that requires the patient to introduce pill-taking into his/her lifestyle brings into question one aspect of mental health, which is motivation to do that which is being proposed. We investigated the influence of each of the components of the adherence trilogy: information, motivation and behavioral abilities, as risk factors in a population of HIV-positive/AIDS patients undergoing antiretroviral treatment in the city of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil."
8428,0.005,5.0,"As Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is scaled up in low- and middle-income countries, it is important to understand Quality of Life (QOL) correlates including disease severity and person characteristics and to determine the extent of between-country differences among those with HIV. QOL and medical data were collected from 1,563 of the 1,571 participants at entry into a randomized clinical trial of ART conducted in the U.S. (n = 203) and 8 resource-limited countries (n = 1,360) in the Caribbean, South America, Asia, and Africa. Participants were interviewed prior to initiation of ART using a modified version of the ACTG SF-21, a health-related QOL measure including 8 subscales: general health perception, physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, cognitive functioning, pain, mental health, and energy/fatigue. Other measures included demographics, CD4+ lymphocyte count, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load. Higher quality of life in each of the 8 QOL subscales was associated with higher CD4+ lymphocyte category. General health perception, physical functioning, role functioning, and energy/fatigue varied by plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load categories. Each QOL subscale included significant variation by country. Only the social functioning subscale varied by sex, with men having greater impairments than women, and only the physical functioning subscale varied by age category. This was the first large-scale international ART trial to conduct a standardized assessment of QOL in diverse international settings, thus demonstrating that implementation of the behavioral assessment was feasible. QOL indicators at study entry varied with disease severity, demographics, and country. The relationship of these measures to treatment outcomes can and should be examined in clinical trials of ART in resource-limited settings using similar methodologies."
1410,0.005,5.0,"Despite the increased incidence of tuberculosis related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in recent decades, pancreatic tuberculosis has rarely been described. We report a case of pancreatic tuberculosis in a 39-year-old African man who presented with progressive dysphagia, vomiting, weight loss and productive cough, accompanied by localized epigastric pain and one episode of melena. HIV-1 testing was positive and lymphocyte subset profile showed CD(4) count of 9/mm(3). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast revealed a cystic mass in the body of the pancreas, significant portal and retroperitoneal cystic adenopathy, and multiple cystic lesions in the spleen and liver. CT guided cyst aspiration and node biopsy detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient responded well on antituberculosis and antiretroviral therapy. Tuberculosis rarely involves the pancreas, probably due to the presence of pancreatic enzymes which interfere with the seeding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Pancreatic tuberculosis is considered to be the result of dissemination of the infection from nearby lymphatic nodes. Endoscopic ultrasound or CT guided fine needle aspiration for cytology is the recommended diagnostic technique. Although the prognosis is good with anti-tuberculosis treatment, it could be fatal without correct diagnosis and treatment. The clinician's high index of suspicion of pancreatic tuberculosis and application of FNAB to obtain pathological evidence are extremely important to a correct diagnosis, especially in young HIV positive patients."
1237,0.005,5.0,"African green monkeys (AGMs) are naturally infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) at high prevalence levels and do not progress to AIDS. Sexual transmission is the main transmission route in AGM, while mother-to-infant transmission (MTIT) is negligible. We investigated SIV transmission in wild AGMs to assess whether or not high SIV prevalence is due to differences in mucosal permissivity to SIV (i.e., whether the genetic bottleneck of viral transmission reported in humans and macaques is also observed in AGMs in the wild). We tested 121 sabaeus AGMs (Chlorocebus sabaeus) from the Gambia and found that 53 were SIV infected (44%). By combining serology and viral load quantitation, we identified 4 acutely infected AGMs, in which we assessed the diversity of the quasispecies by single-genome amplification (SGA) and documented that a single virus variant established the infections. We thus show that natural SIV transmission in the wild is associated with a genetic bottleneck similar to that described for mucosal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission in humans. Flow cytometry assessment of the immune cell populations did not identify major differences between infected and uninfected AGM. The expression of the SIV coreceptor CCR5 on CD4+ T cells dramatically increased in adults, being higher in infected than in uninfected infant and juvenile AGMs. Thus, the limited SIV MTIT in natural hosts appears to be due to low target cell availability in newborns and infants, which supports HIV MTIT prevention strategies aimed at limiting the target cells at mucosal sites. Combined, (i) the extremely high prevalence in sexually active AGMs, (ii) the very efficient SIV transmission in the wild, and (iii) the existence of a fraction of multiparous females that remain uninfected in spite of massive exposure to SIV identify wild AGMs as an acceptable model of exposed, uninfected individuals."
3186,0.005,5.0,"During infection with the hepatitis A virus (HAV), most patients develop mild or asymptomatic disease. However, a small number of patients develop serious, life-threatening hepatitis. We investigated this variability in disease severity by examining 30 Argentinean patients with HAV-induced acute liver failure in a case-control, cross-sectional, observational study. We found that HAV-induced severe liver disease was associated with a 6-amino-acid insertion in TIM1/HAVCR1 (157insMTTTVP), the gene encoding the HAV receptor. This polymorphism was previously shown to be associated with protection against asthma and allergic diseases and with HIV progression. In binding assays, the TIM-1 protein containing the 157insMTTTVP insertion polymorphism bound HAV more efficiently. When expressed by human natural killer T (NKT) cells, this long form resulted in greater NKT cell cytolytic activity against HAV-infected liver cells, compared with the shorter TIM-1 protein without the polymorphism. To our knowledge, the 157insMTTTVP polymorphism in TIM1 is the first genetic susceptibility factor shown to predispose to HAV-induced acute liver failure. Furthermore, these results suggest that HAV infection has driven the natural selection of shorter forms of the TIM-1 protein, which binds HAV less efficiently, thereby protecting against severe HAV-induced disease, but which may predispose toward inflammation associated with asthma and allergy."
6165,0.005,5.0,"We examined the longitudinal association between alcohol use and liver fibrosis, measured by FIB-4 Score, among HIV-infected individuals by (1) antiretroviral therapy (ART) class, and (2) the presence of hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection. This was a prospective cohort study of 550 individuals in the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort initiating ART between 2000 and 2012. The relationship between alcohol consumption (defined using NIAAA categories of non-, moderate, and hazardous drinkers) and liver fibrosis (FIB-4 score) by ART class was assessed using linear mixed effects models. Additionally, we examined whether the presence of HCV modified and whether viral load mediated the relationship between alcohol use and liver fibrosis. Overall, FIB-4 levels were 15.6% higher in hazardous drinkers compared to moderate drinkers (p = 0.025) after adjusting by age, sex, and race. Hazardous drinkers on PI-based regimens had FIB-4 scores 26.9% higher than moderate drinkers (p = 0.015). However, there was no difference in FIB-4 levels between hazardous drinkers on non-PI-based regimens compared to moderate drinkers (1.83% versus moderate drinkers, p = 0.848). There was no significant difference in FIB-4 between nondrinkers and moderate drinkers, irrespective of ART regimen. These associations were not modified by HCV status or mediated by viral load changes. Individuals with hazardous alcohol consumption and on PI-based regimens had significantly increased liver fibrosis, as measured by the FIB-4. These data suggest that providers should consider level of alcohol consumption when choosing an ART regimen to minimize detrimental effects on the liver."
4564,0.005,5.0,"In HIV-infected individuals, coinfection with HBV and/or HCV is common because of shared modes of transmission. It is known that HIV accelerates progression of liver disease and results in increased morbidity and mortality associated with viral hepatitis, but it is less clear if viral hepatitis has a direct effect on HIV. Treatment of viral hepatitis improves outcomes and should be considered in all HIV-infected patients. Treatment of HBV without concurrent treatment of HIV is risky because resistance can occur in both viruses if regimens are not carefully chosen. "
9482,0.005,5.0,"In the past few years there has been increasing concern about the transmission of drug-resistant HIV. This study aimed to describe the frequency of primary mutations associated with HIV-1 drug resistance and the prevalence of genetic HIV subtypes in a population of vertically infected children before the initiation of HAART. At the time of genotypic testing, the median age was 6.0 years (IQR 25-75%: 3.8-9.2) and the median age at admission was 3.84 years (IQR 25-75%: 1.23-6.11). Antepartum maternal ARV exposure for PMTCT occurred for three (7.3%) mothers. According to the WHO criteria, primary ARV resistance mutations were detected in four out of 41 (9.8%) children. Subtype B was the most prevalent (63.4%). The relatively high prevalence of primary HIV-1 DRMs in this cohort of perinatally infected children in Brazil supports the local recommendation to perform resistance testing in all newly diagnosed children, regardless of age at diagnosis and antenatal ARV exposure."
8382,0.005,5.0,"This study describes and conceptualizes the experiences of stigma in a group of children living with HIV in São Paulo, Brazil, and evaluates the impact of access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) over the social course of AIDS and over the children's experiences of stigma. Through ethnographic research in São Paulo from 1999 to 2001, the life trajectories of 50 children ages 1-15 living with or affected by HIV were studied. Data were collected via participant observation and semi-structured informal interviews and analyzed using social theories on illness experience and social inequality. Our results demonstrate that AIDS-related stigma occurs within complex discrimination processes that change as children reach adolescence. We found that structural violence in the forms of poverty, racism, and inequalities in social status, gender, and age fuels children's experiences of stigma. We also describe how access to HAART changes the lived experience of children, reduces stigma, and brings new challenges in AIDS care such as adolescents' sexuality and treatment adherence. Based on these results, we propose structural violence as the framework to study stigma and argue that interventions to reduce stigma that solely target the perception and attitudes toward people living with HIV are limited. In contrast universal access to HAART in Brazil is a powerful intervention that reduces stigma, in that it transforms AIDS from a debilitating and fatal disease to a chronic and manageable one, belongs to a broader mechanism to assure citizens' rights, and reduces social inequalities in access to health care."
6078,0.005,5.0,"A prospective study was carried out on 200 patients admitted to Fairfield Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, with acute hepatitis A to determine the frequency with which virus could be detected in their feces. Evidence of infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) was obtained by detecting IgM specific for HAV in a single serum sample or by demonstrating a rising titer of antibody in paired sera by solid-phase radioimmunoassay. HAV was detected in the feces of 59 of the 200 patients by solid-phase radioimmunoassay and immune electron microscopy. When patients were admitted within one week of the onset of dark urine, 45% were found to be shedding HAV, whereas only 11% of specimens obtained from patients admitted during the second week contained virus. HAV was not detected in fecal specimens collected more than 14 days after the onset of dark urine. These findings suggest that patients admitted to hospital with hepatitis A may still be infectious and that appropriate precautions against fecal contamination should be maintained."
3995,0.005,5.0,"Despite three decades of dramatic treatment breakthroughs in antiretroviral regimens, clinical outcomes for people living with HIV vary greatly. The HIV treatment cascade models the stages of care that people living with HIV go through toward the goal of viral suppression and demonstrates that <30% of those living with HIV/AIDS in the United States have met this goal. Although some research has focused on the ways that patient characteristics and patient-provider relationships contribute to clinical adherence and treatment success, few studies to date have examined the ways that contextual factors of care and the healthcare environment contribute to patient outcomes. Here, we present qualitative findings from a mixed-methods study to describe contextual and healthcare environment factors in a Ryan White Part C clinic that are associated with patients' abilities to achieve viral suppression. We propose a modification of Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization, and its more recent adaptation developed by Ulett et al., to describe the ways that clinic, system, and provider factors merge to create a system of care in which more than 86% of the patient population is virally suppressed."
8813,0.005,5.0,"A previous study revealed a high prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) RNA among 249 apparently healthy individuals (mean+/-standard deviation age, 48.4+/-13.9 years; 126 males and 123 females) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. To investigate further the prevalence of HDV infection there, the same serum samples obtained from the cohort were tested for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) class antibody to HDV (anti-HDV) by a newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant hepatitis delta antigen protein expressed in the pupae of silkworm as the antigen probe. Anti-HDV was detected in 42 persons (16.9%), among whom 22 (52.4%) were positive for HBsAg and 20 (47.6%) had detectable HDV RNA. Among 170 persons with anti-HBc in the absence of HBsAg, 20 (11.8%) tested positive for anti-HDV, and 1 of the 20 subjects was positive for HDV RNA. Of note, none of 55 anti-HBc-negative persons had anti-HDV, supporting the specificity of the anti-HDV assay. The optical density (OD) value of anti-HDV was significantly higher among HDV RNA-positive subjects (n=21) than among HDV RNA-negative subjects (n=21) (2.513+/-0.514 vs. 0.836+/-0.550, P<0.0001). The present study confirmed the extremely high prevalence of HDV infection in Mongolia, and identified a person who was positive for both anti-HDV and HDV RNA despite negativity for HBsAg and HBV DNA probably due to viral interference. The anti-HDV assay may be useful for further epidemiological studies on HDV infection in larger cohorts in urban and rural areas of Mongolia, where elucidation of the transmission route of HDV is required urgently."
4591,0.005,5.0,"The role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis D virus (HDV) coinfections as determinants of hepatitis C virus (HCV) suppression in the setting of HIV-HCV coinfection are poorly understood. Our aim was to assess whether HCV viral replication may be affected by HBV or HDV coinfection in the setting of immunodeficiency driven by HIV.Among the 138 enrolled patients 28(20.3%) tested HCV RNA negative and 110 (79.7%) tested HCV RNA negative. The HCV RNA negative patients showed an higher rate of HBsAg positivity compared with those tested HCVRNA positive [12/28 (42.9%) and 5/110 (4.6%), respectively]. Patients with HCV-HBV-HDV coinfection had the highest chance of having an undetectable HCV RNA (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 92.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.7-1483.5, p<0.0001). Furthermore, HBV coinfection per se was also found to be independently associated with negative HCV viraemia (AOR: 18.5, 95% CI 2.4-143.5, p<0.0001). HBsAg-positive patients with negative HCV viraemia maintained undetectable levels over time. Our results support a direct role of HBV and HDV coinfections in suppressing HCV viraemia in HIV infected patients. This effect is durable over time, and is not influenced by HAART including anti-HBV drugs."

It can be assumed that every member of the operating dental staff in Tanzania frequently treats HIV-positive patients. The knowledge of AIDS and HIV infection was investigated by Tanzanian dental teams in 1988 and 1989. In both years almost one quarter of the dental officers and half the other operating team members chose incorrect information about the methods of transmission of HIV. Several respondents named health care workers as belonging to a high risk group. Fever and loss of weight were known to be early symptoms of AIDS. In 1989, when asked to identify oral manifestations of HIV, one quarter of all the dental staff could not mention any of them. The findings of the study emphasise the need for urgent further education of dental teams in Tanzania."
2031,0.005,5.0,"Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is more prevalent than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but more public health resources are allocated to HIV than to HCV. Given shared risk factors and epidemiology, we compared accuracy of health beliefs about HIV and HCV in an at-risk community. Between 2002 and 2003, we surveyed a random patient sample at a primary care clinic in New York. The survey was organized as domains of Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation: causes ('sharing needles'), timeline/consequences ('remains in body for life', 'causes cancer') and controllability ('I can avoid this illness', 'medications may cure this illness'). We compared differences in accuracy of beliefs about HIV and HCV and used multivariable linear regression to identify factors associated with relative accuracy of beliefs. One hundred and twenty-two subjects completed the survey (response rate 42%). Mean overall health belief accuracy was 12/15 questions (80%) for HIV vs 9/15 (60%) for HCV (P < 0.001). Belief accuracy was significantly different across all domains. Within the causes domain, 60% accurately believed sharing needles a risk factor for HCV compared to 92% for HIV (P < 0.001). Within the timeline/consequences domain, 42% accurately believed HCV results in lifelong infection compared to 89% for HIV (P < 0.001). Within the controllability domain, 25% accurately believed that there is a potential cure for HCV. Multivariable linear regression revealed female gender as significantly associated with greater health belief accuracy for HIV. Thus, study participants had significantly less accurate health beliefs about HCV than about HIV. Targeting inaccuracies might improve public health interventions to foster healthier behaviours and better hepatitis C outcomes."

Accordingly, we examined if HIV infection was associated with unmet support needs among men living with and without HIV receiving community mental health care. This cross-sectional study examined 215 men (135 living with HIV and 80 without HIV) receiving case management services in urban Ontario. Using the Camberwell Assessment of Need, we ascertained the prevalence of support needs in 13 domains grouped into three clusters: Basic needs (accommodation, food, benefits, and money management); self-care/functional needs (daytime activities, self-care, and looking after the home); and health/safety needs (physical, psychological distress, psychotic symptoms, safety to self, and safety to others). We used generalized estimating equations with a logit link to examine the association between HIV and unmet need in each domain. Compared to HIV-negative men, men with HIV were more likely to have mood and concurrent disorders, and intellectual and developmental disabilities. Following multivariable analyses, men with HIV had greater unmet needs related to food (odds ratio + 95% confidence interval: 9.36 (4.03, 21.75), p < 0.001); money (OR: 1.90 (1.04, 3.47), p = 0.036) [basic need domains]; psychological distress (OR: 2.39 (1.68, 3.41), p < 0.001); drug use (OR: 5.10 (2.16, 12.08) p < 0.001); and safety to self (OR: 3.35 (1.51, 7.52), p < 0.003) [health and safety domains]. Despite living in a setting with universal health insurance, men with HIV receiving community mental health support had greater unmet need in basic and health domains than HIV-negative men receiving such support. Further research is required to develop and evaluate interventions to best support community-dwelling persons with HIV and mental health disorders."
3610,0.005,5.0,"Recent findings suggest bidirectional antagonisms between the K65R mutation and thymidine analogue mutations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected, treatment-experienced patients, yet little is known about HIV-2 in this regard. This study addressed the effects of innate polymorphisms in HIV-2 on emergent resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. Emergent drug resistance profiles in HIV-2 subtypes A (n = 3) and B (n = 1) were compared to those of HIV-1 subtypes B and C. Drug resistance was evaluated with cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) and MT2 cells, using selective pressure with tenofovir (TFV), zidovudine (ZDV), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), abacavir (ABC), lamivudine (3TC), emtricitabine (FTC), or various dual-drug combinations. Resistance was evaluated using conventional and ultrasensitive sequencing approaches. In agreement with our previous findings, dual-drug combinations of TFV, ddI, ABC, d4T, ZDV, and 3TC preferentially selected for K65R in HIV-1 subtype C isolates. In HIV-1 subtype B, TFV-3TC and ZDV-3TC selected for M184I and D67N, respectively. In contrast, selections with all four HIV-2 cultures favored the development of M184I in dual-drug combinations that included either 3TC or FTC. Since HIV-2 cultures did not develop K65R, an ultrasensitive allele-specific real-time PCR assay was developed to distinguish the presence of 65R from wild-type K65 after 16 cycles with a discriminatory ability of 0.1% against a population of wild-type virus. These results underscore potential differences in emergent drug resistance pathways in HIV-1 and HIV-2 and show that polymorphisms may influence the development of the resistance pathways that are likely to emerge."
119,0.005,5.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in HIV-positive individuals. Although HBV vaccination is mandatory for HIV-positive individuals with negative-HBV markers, lower rates of protection are achieved. HIV infection accelerates the course of liver disease caused by chronic HBV infection, leading to end-stage hepatic illness and increasing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Anti-HBV active agents, especially tenofovir, improve outcomes. Lamivudine alone should be limited to patients with low serum HBV-DNA levels, since selection of drug resistance often compromises long-term benefits, leads to cross-resistance with other antivirals, and favors the potential emergence of HBV-vaccine escape mutants.

242,0.005,5.0,"To assess the epidemiology of infection with the delta agent associated with hepatitis B virus, sera from 1314 carriers of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 687 patients with hepatitis B collected in 1978-1981 from different regions of Italy were tested for delta antigen and antibody to the antigen (anti-delta), and the characteristics of delta-positive patients were analyzed. Anti-delta was found in each center participating in the study, indicating that delta infection has spread throughout Italy. Its prevalence was higher in carriers in southern Italy and in those with chronic hepatitis. In northern Italy, delta infection predominated among southern emigrants in industrial towns but also among parenteral drug addicts with hepatitis B virus infection. The prevalence of delta markers was variable and generally low in acute hepatitis B, suggesting that in Italy self-limited forms of delta infection occur sporadically or by limited outbreaks. Delta infection appears to be endemic in southern Italy but a new epidemiologic event in northern Italy, where it was probably introduced by southern emigrants and is presently exceeding its ethnic confinement to spread selectively in communities of drug addicts. Presumably, the endemicity of delta is maintained by transmission of this agent from carrier to carrier of the HBsAg."
7890,0.005,5.0,"Certain human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates are able to productively infect nondividing cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. We have used a molecular genetic approach to construct two different HIV-1 integrase mutants that were studied in the context of an infectious, macrophage-tropic HIV-1 molecular clone. One mutant, HIV-1 delta D(35)E, containing a 37-residue deletion within the central, catalytic domain of integrase, was noninfectious in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte-derived macrophages. The HIV-1 delta D(35)E mutant, however, exhibited defects in the assembly and/or release of progeny virions in transient transfection assays, as well as defects in entry and/or viral DNA synthesis during the early stages of monocyte-derived macrophage infection. The second mutant, HIV-1D116N/8, containing a single Asp-to-Asn substitution at the invariant Asp-116 residue of integrase, was also noninfectious in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte-derived macrophages but, in contrast to HIV-1 delta D(35)E, was indistinguishable from wild-type virus in reverse transcriptase production. PCR analysis indicated that HIV-1D116N/8 entered monocyte-derived macrophages efficiently and reverse transcribed its RNA but was unable to complete its replication cycle because of a presumed block to integration. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that integration is an obligate step in productive HIV-1 infection of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and primary human macrophage cultures."
8329,0.005,5.0,"The duration of HIV infection is usually unknown for most patients entering into HIV care. Data on the frequency at which resistance mutations are detected in these patients are needed to support practical guidance on the use of resistance testing in this clinical situation. Furthermore, little is known about HIV subtype diversity in much of the United States. Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence of drug resistance mutations and nonsubtype B strains of HIV among antiretroviral-naïve individuals presenting for HIV care in New York State between September 2000 and January 2004. Sequences were obtained using a commercial HIV genotyping assay. Seventeen of 151 subjects (11.3%; 95% confidence interval 7.2%-17.3%) had at least one drug-resistance mutation, including 5 subjects with fewer than 200 CD4(+) T cells, indicative of advanced infection. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and protease inhibitor resistance mutations were detected in 6.6%, 5.3%, and 0.7% of subjects, respectively. Subjects from New York City-based clinics were less likely to have resistant virus than subjects from clinics elsewhere in New York State. Nonsubtype B strains of HIV were detected in 9 (6.0%) individuals and were associated with heterosexual contact. Two nonsubtype B strains from this cohort also carried drug-resistance mutations. These data indicate that drug-resistant virus is frequently detected in antiretroviral-naïve individuals entering HIV care in New York State. Furthermore, a diverse set of nonsubtype B strains were identified and evidence suggests that nonsubtype B strains, including those carrying drug-resistance mutations, are being transmitted in New York State."
5650,0.005,5.0,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is increasing in the heterosexual community and people already affected by HIV are living longer. As a result, health visitors will be more involved in caring for people with HIV and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge level of health visitors about HIV infection and AIDS, and to identify some of the attitudes held by them concerning AIDS and the variety of symptoms that can occur in HIV positive individuals (AIDS related complex) before they have actually developed AIDS. The influence of AIDS-related education and the experience of caring for affected patients on health visitors' knowledge of the disease was assessed. The attitudes of carers towards these patients were also ascertained. All heath visitors (n = 88) working in the Merton and Sutton Community Healthcare Trust were invited to participate in a questionnaire survey. Fifty-five health visitors participated. Knowledge relating to HIV and AIDS was good, but the majority of respondents felt they did not have all the information they needed about HIV and AIDS. Almost one-quarter of respondents had cared for a client who was either HIV positive or had AIDS. Overall, the findings were quite encouraging. However, further education, training, and support were identified as necessary. These shortfalls need to be addressed in order to fully assist health visitors in their role of caring for clients and families affected by HIV and AIDS."
4386,0.005,5.0,"Implementation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has deeply changed the landscape of HIV-associated malignancies. Some AIDS-defining tumors, namely Primitive Lymphoma of Central Nervous System, have drastically declined, whereas a steady increase has been observed for non-AIDS-defining tumors, maybe due to longer survival of HIV-infected people. Easier immune restoration, subsequent to availability of a number of drugs targeting HIV at different points, has decreased opportunistic infections which hampered treatment of HIV-associated cancers. As a matter of fact these patients have been assimilated more and more with their negative counterpart, undergoing the same aggressive approach. Consistently, procedures that have been so far precluded to HIV+ subjects, such as transplant of hemopoietic stem cells, either autologous or allogenic, and liver transplant are expected to be performed more and more extensively in this population. Which also would mean a full removal of the stigma which has weighed on it. Hence, it is true-like that malignancies and related problems may in the next future make up a main concern for the HIV specialist. Old and new challenges might be the drug-drug interaction of antiretrovirals or biotherapy-related infections or the debated question of an earlier HAART implementation in the course of HIV disease, with CD4+ cells > 500/μl. In fact, if assimilation of HIV patients with cancer and the general population is a remarkable achieved goal, uniqueness of HIV infection in terms of immune status still makes HIV-associated cancer a unique chapter in the setting of Oncology."
9938,0.005,5.0,"Adult HIV prevalence exceeds 5% among all Kenyans, and 20% among the Luo ethnic group. Recent studies have associated HIV infections in Kenya with several invasive health care and cosmetic procedures. To explore the various blood exposures that could contribute to HIV infections in Kenya, we surveyed 320 adolescents and adults aged 15-29 years from the Luo and Kisii ethnic groups. Survey participants reported a wide range of invasive procedures in health care (including circumcisions, dental care, blood tests, and 1-60 injections or infusions for specific health problems), in cosmetic services (including tattooing and piercing) and around the home (through shaving body hair, fights, sports and other activities). Luo were significantly more likely than Kisii to report some risks (e.g. tattooing by a traditional expert, piercing), but less likely to report others (e.g. blood tests for malaria, anaesthetic injections during circumcision)."
5712,0.005,5.0,"Acute HIV-1 infection is often diagnosed as infectious mononucleosis and the symptoms resolve spontaneously after varying periods of time. After the infection of HIV-1 through the mucosa, the characteristic clinical symptoms and laboratory markers of acute HIV-1 infection appear in each patient through a complicated virus-host interaction. To understand the host responses, we measured two unique proinflammatory cytokines, galectin-9 (Gal-9) and osteopontin (OPN). A β-galactoside-binding mammalian lectin, Gal-9, reduces pro-inflammatory type-1 helper T (Th1) cells and Th17 cells and increases anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells. The plasma level of Gal-9 is known to be associated with HIV-1 viral load in chronic HIV-1 infection. On the contrary, osteopontin induces Th1/Th17 cells and promotes tissue inflammation. OPN is synthesized by variety of cells in the body, and dendritic cells are known to synthesize OPN in HIV-1 infected individuals. It was hypothesized that Gal-9 and/or OPN could be not only immune-modulators but also novel biomarkers of acute HIV-1 infection. We experienced 3 patients with acute HIV-1 and measured the levels of Gal-9 and OPN periodically before and after antiretroviral treatment. The results showed that the plasma levels of Gal-9 were extremely elevated [more than 2,300 pg/ml (normal range < 46 pg/ml)] in all three acute HIV-1 infected individuals and decreased rapidly after treatment. The changes in the OPN levels were less marked. In conclusion, the plasma levels of Gal-9 may be predictive of a severe inflammation status during the acute phase of HIV-1 infection and could be a potential biomarker during acute infection."
3241,0.005,5.0,"The resuscitation of a trauma patient is a very hectic and seemingly chaotic situation. The nature of the situation increases the likelihood that a health care worker will receive an accidental needle stick while caring for the patient. There is also a common belief that there is a higher prevalence of communicable bloodborne diseases in the trauma population, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes the greatest amount of fear. This belief of higher prevalence communicable diseases in the trauma population is supported by the literature. We sent blood from our Code One (life-threatening) trauma population for analysis for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibodies. We found that 0.52% of our trauma population had HIV. We also found that 1.5 per cent had hepatitis B surface antigen, and 13.8 per cent had hepatitis C antibodies. Our prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B is similar to that found in other studies of the trauma populations and higher than the general population. Our hepatitis C prevalence is surprising, considering the very low reported prevalence in the general population. Hepatitis C may be a more significant threat to the health of medical personnel than previously believed."
3926,0.005,5.0,"The objectives of this study were first, to identify psychosocial and medical service utilization factors associated with unprotected sex with HIV-negative or unknown serostatus partners among persons living with HIV/AIDS, and second, to identify risk behaviours associated with HIV medical service use. We assessed 244 HIV-positive participants in an HIV intervention targeting drug users (1997-99). Fifty-seven per cent of HIV-positive participants reported unprotected sex within the past 90 days, 16.4% with serodiscordant partners. Odds of risky sex were lower among those currently receiving HIV medical care (odds ratio (OR)=0.36), and were greater among females (OR=2.6), those having friends with lower norms of condom use (OR=3.3), and those having a main sexual partner (OR=6.2). Lower odds of receiving HIV medical care were associated with current drug use (OR=0.33), sharing drugs with a sex partner (OR=0.27), and exchanging sex for drugs or money (OR=0.24). Findings suggest the importance of community-based HIV prevention intervention targeting HIV-positive drug users not recovery HIV medical care."
2991,0.005,5.0,"HIV-related stigma remains a persistent global health concern among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWA) in developing nations. The literature is lacking in studies about healthcare students' perceptions of PLWA. This study is the first effort to understand stigmatizing attitudes toward HIV-positive patients by healthcare students in Mwanza, Tanzania, not just those who will be directly treating patients but also those who will be indirectly involved through nonclinical roles, such as handling patient specimens and private health information. A total of 208 students were drawn from Clinical Medicine, Laboratory Sciences, Health Records and Information Management, and Community Health classes at the Tandabui Institute of Health Sciences and Technology for a voluntary survey that assessed stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. Students generally obtained high scores on the overall survey instrument, pointing to low stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA and an overall willingness to treat PLWA with the same standard of care as other patients. However, there are gaps in knowledge that exist among students, such as a comprehensive understanding of all routes of HIV infection. The study also suggests that students who interact with patients as part of their training are less likely to exhibit stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. A comprehensive course in HIV infection, one that includes classroom sessions focused on the epidemiology and routes of transmission as well as clinical opportunities to directly interact with PLWA-perhaps through teaching sessions led by PLWA-may allow for significant reductions in stigma toward such patients and improve clinical outcomes for PLWA around the world."
9717,0.005,5.0,"Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can improve immune system function through suppression of HIV-1 replication. However, paradoxical immune response may develop in some patients as a result of effective therapy followed by immune restoration. The phenomena is known as IRS, immune reconstitution syndrome/immune recovery syndrome. IRS can develop within weeks to months after cART is commenced and the time is related to the type of the disease. There are but scant reports concerning IRS-NHL (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) in HIV-1 positive subjects. We observed 4 (33%) cases of IRS-NHL out of 12 patients in whom NHL was diagnosed. As a result of potent cART they reached viral suppression in a mean time of 15 weeks followed by a rise in CD4(+) T cells within 16.5 weeks. The diagnosis of NHL was established at a mean time of 36 weeks after cART was introduced and 20 weeks after the CD4 T cell increase was achieved. This may indicate that the immune reconstitution as a result of cART was a predisposing factor for the development of NHL in our patients. There was prompt progression of the disease and the outcome was fatal in all cases. IRS-NHL should be suspected in any case of lymphadenopathy, generalized or limited to the abdomen or periphery, which develops after immune recovery due to potent cART within a few months."
1987,0.005,5.0,"Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection often develop multiple complications and comorbidities. Opportunistic infections should always be considered in the evaluation of symptomatic patients with advanced HIV/AIDS, although the overall incidence of these infections has decreased. Primary care of HIV infection includes the early detection of some complications through screening at-risk and symptomatic patients with routine laboratory monitoring (e.g., comprehensive metabolic and lipid panels) and validated tools (e.g., the HIV Dementia Scale). Treatment of many chronic complications is similar for patients with HIV infection and those without infection; however, combination antiretroviral therapy has shown benefit for some conditions, such as HIV-associated nephropathy. For other complications, such as cardiovascular disease and lipoatrophy, management may include switching antiretroviral regimens to reduce exposure to HIV medications known to cause toxicity."
4829,0.005,5.0,"We have analyzed the sequences of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients receiving antiretroviral therapy to evaluate the drug resistance-associated mutations. Of 84 HIV-1-infected individuals treated with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 43 (51.2%) have been found to carry amino acid substitutions predicted to acquire drug-resistances. One to 3 mutations at amino acid residues reported to be associated with protease inhibitor-resistance were detected in more than 80% of protease inhibitor-naive patients. However, these pre-existing mutations did not seem to raise a real resistance after the initiation of therapy with protease inhibitors. Phenotypic resistance assay was performed with 6 clinical isolates to compare with genotypic resistance. In most of the cases, phenotype was correlated with genotypic changes, however, two strains which were isolated from patients having no experience of chemotherapy showed a decrease in susceptibility to several drugs without any resistance-related mutations detected in their genes. Taken together, determination of phenotypic resistance is necessary, especially when a newly-infected patients starts antiviral therapy."

The present study describes the HPV prevalence in urine samples of 243 HIV-infected men and a control group of 231 men. HPV DNA was amplified by the SPF10 polymerase chain reaction primer set. The overall HPV prevalence in HIV-infected men was 27.5% compared with 12.6% in controls (P < 0.01). Infections with high-risk and multiple HPV genotypes were present in both groups. Differences were not statistically significant. A multivariate logistic regression model showed a decreased HPV prevalence associated with use of a nucleoside and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor combination (P = 0.03). A trend was observed towards a higher HPV prevalence and a lower CD4 cell count. Further prospective studies are needed to determine the role of HPV DNA testing in urine in future screening programmes for anal cancer in men."
2709,0.004,4.0,"Chronic hepatitis B affects nearly 10% of HIV-infected patients. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a dynamic disease and coinfection with HIV impacts directly on the outcome of HBV infection, considerably complicating its natural history, diagnosis, and management. The aim of this study was to compare two cohorts of HBV monoinfected and HBV/HIV coinfected Iranian patients undergoing long-term lamivudine therapy from the clinical and virological aspects, as well as the frequency of detected mutations in HBV genome. To this end, HBV Pol/S regions from 72 patients were PCR-amplified and directly sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a 40-times higher risk of coinfection with ayw3 subtype of HBV genotype D rather than ayw2 subtype [P<0.001, odd: 40.66, CI: 95 % (4.69-352.23)]. While no resistance mutation was detected in HBV/HIV coinfected cohort, LAM-resistance mutations (rtM204I/V in YMDD and rtL180M in FLLA polymerase motifs) were identified in 30% (9 out of 30) and 16.66% (5 out of 30) of HBV monoinfected patients (P<0.05). Moreover, several mutations (sP105A, sI110S/L, sS136Y and sP127T/L) with significant differences in the frequency were identified in the S region of both cohorts. Finally, this study found strong correlation between the type of infection (mono or coinfection) and characteristics like patient gender, ALT levels, HBV-DNA levels and HBV subtypes. These results pointed to the importance of determination of HBV variants in the management of patients and suggested that in contrary to HBV monoinfections, LAM may be still an appropriate drug for the treatment of HBV in HBV/HIV coinfected patients; however, further studies to clarify the role of HIV in HBV LAM-resistance mutations are required."
5585,0.004,4.0,"The objective of this study was to determine the self-reported prevalence of needlestick injuries among practicing electromyographers. In January 2008, an anonymous electronic survey was sent to all active members of the American Association for Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) who provided e-mail addresses to the Association. Eight hundred and eight members (56% neurologists, 43% physiatrists; 97% practicing physicians, 3% trainees) responded, with a response rate of 22% (808 of 3659). The mean number of years in practice, involving electromyography (EMG) at least 1 day per week, was 16 years. A majority of physicians (64%) reported at least one needlestick injury involving EMG, and 8% reported five or more injuries. Needlestick injuries involving patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), hepatitis B, and/or hepatitis C occurred in 1 of every 11 electromyographers. Nearly half of all respondents (44%) who experienced a needlestick injury stated that they did not report at least one injury event to official centers. Injuries were most likely to occur during a routine procedure (45%) or when a patient moved (26%). The most common preventable reason for injury was a perceived lack of time."
8747,0.004,4.0,"In a previous paper, we determined that treatment of lymphocytes with nonviable preparations of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) results in an impairment of the phosphatidylinositol/protein kinase C pathway, most likely due to an inhibition of the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate into inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, mediated by phospholipase C. Here we show that one consequence of these changes is a reduced phosphorylation of nuclear matrix-associated DNA topoisomerase II, resulting in an inhibition of the activity of this enzyme. Antibodies to the viral proteins suppressed the inhibitory effects caused by the HIV-1 preparation. Furthermore, the phytohemagglutinin A-caused augmentation of nuclear matrix-associated DNA polymerase alpha and beta activities was found to be abolished by coincubation with the HIV preparation or with the HIV-1 gp120. The phytohemagglutinin A-enhanced matrix association and processivity of DNA polymerase alpha was determined to be reduced if the lymphocytes were in contact with HIV-1 preparation. These results suggest that the reduced proliferative response of lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin A in the presence of disrupted HIV-1 preparation is due to inhibition of at least two, perhaps separate, pathways, one involving protein kinase C resulting in a reduced phosphorylation of DNA topoisomerase II and the other changing the state of matrix association of DNA polymerase alpha and beta."
555,0.004,4.0,"The KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa is experiencing an explosive outbreak of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C infections. Understanding the genetic diversity of C viruses and the biological consequences of this diversity is important for the design of effective control strategies. We analyzed the protease gene, the first 935 nucleotides of reverse transcriptase, and the C2V5 envelope region of a representative set of 72 treatment-naïve patients from KwaZulu-Natal and correlated the results with amino acid signature and resistance patterns. Phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple clusters or ""lineages"" of HIV-1 subtype C that segregated with other C viruses from southern Africa. The same pattern was observed for both black and Indian subgroups and for retrospective specimens collected prior to 1990, indicating that multiple sublineages of HIV-1 C have been present in KwaZulu-Natal since the early stages of the epidemic. With the exception of three nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations, no primary resistance mutations were identified. Numerous accessory polymorphisms were present in the protease, but none were located at drug-binding or active sites of the enzyme. One frequent polymorphism, I93L, was located near the protease/reverse transcriptase cleavage site. In the envelope, disruption of the glycosylation motif at the beginning of V3 was associated with the presence of an extra protein kinase C phosphorylation site at codon 11. Many polymorphisms were embedded within cytotoxic T lymphocyte or overlapping cytotoxic T-lymphocyte/T-helper epitopes, as defined for subtype B. This work forms a baseline for future studies aimed at understanding the impact of genetic diversity on vaccine efficacy and on natural susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs."

Transmission risk behavior, HAART-taking, and psychosocial distress of the growing population of Russian people living with HIV (PLH) in the HAART era are understudied. Participants of a systematically-recruited cross-sectional sample of 492 PLH in St. Petersburg completed measures of sexual and drug injection practices, adherence, perceived discrimination, and psychosocial distress. Since learning of their status, 58% of participants had partners of HIV-negative or unknown serostatus (mean = 5.8). About 52% reported unprotected intercourse with such partners, with 30% of acts unprotected. Greater perceived discrimination predicted lower condom use. A 47% of IDU PLH still shared needles, predicted by having no primary partner, lower education, and more frequently-encountered discrimination. Twenty-five percentage of PLH had been refused general health care, 11% refused employment, 7% fired, and 6% forced from family homes. Thirty-nine percentage of participants had probable clinical depression, 37% had anxiety levels comparable to psychiatric inpatients, and social support was low. Of the 54% of PLH who were offered HAART, 16% refused HAART regimens, and 5% of those on the therapy took less than 90% of their doses. Comprehensive community services for Russian PLH are needed to reduce AIDS-related psychosocial distress and continued HIV transmission risk behaviors. Social programs should reduce stigma and discrimination, and promote social integration of affected persons and their families."
7070,0.004,4.0,"For assessing the role of circulating immune complexes (CICs) in acute hepatitis B, CICs containing HBsAg, IgM, and IgG were determined, by C1q and conglutinin (K) assays, in 242 patients with acute hepatitis B and 60 healthy controls. CIC is a common feature of acute hepatitis B with 90.9% of cases having at least one abnormal test result. Patients with shorter interval (< 1 week) between onset of symptoms and patient presentation have significantly higher frequency of abnormal IgM class CIC, HBsAg-specific CIC, and higher frequency of raised alanine aminotransferase activity (> 30-fold upper limit of normal). The prevalence of raised alanine aminotransferase in patients with CIC containing HBsAg and IgM is higher than those without (P = 0.001). There is significant association between HBsAg-CIC and C1q-CIC. In conclusion, HBsAg-CIC and IgM class CIC correlate with disease activity. C1q-binding CIC is the predominant CIC that may play a role in the pathogenesis of acute hepatitis B."
9656,0.004,4.0,"Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACAs) are formed against phospholipids in various clinical conditions such as autoimmune diseases, malignancy, infectious diseases, alcohol-related and hepatic cirrhosis. The aims of this study were to investigate the presence of ACAs in patients with chronic hepatitis B together with positive total anti-delta antibodies, and to investigate the relationship between age, gender, and some laboratory parameters (ALT, AST, albumin, globulin, platelet number) of patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection, who were positive or negative for ACAs. A total of 60 patients (43 male, 17 female) with chronic hepatitis D infection [HBsAg positive, HBeAg negative, anti-HBe positive, anti-HBc IgG positive, anti-HBc IgM negative, total anti-delta positive, anti-HCV negative] and 30 patients (21 male, 9 female) without hepatitis D infection [HBsAg positive, HBeAg negative, anti-HBe positive, anti-HBc IgG positive, anti-HBc IgM negative, total anti-delta negative, anti-HCV negative] as control group were included to the study. ACA IgG and IgM were searched by a commercial microELISA kit (Euroimmun, Germany). The statistical evaluation was performed with Pearson's chi-square test, Student's t-test, and Fisher's exact test. Total ACAs positivity rate of 60 patients with chronic HDV infection, was found as 13.3%, in which four of the patients were positive for only ACA IgM, while four was positive for only IgG. Positivity for both ACA IgG and ACA IgM could not be detected in these patients. No patients in the control group had positivity for ACAs (IgG and/or IgM). A statistically significant difference was observed in terms of ACA positivity between patients with and without HDV infection (p< 0.05). After all, there was no statistically significant correlation between ACAs positivity and the age, sex, and laboratory parameters of the patients with chronic HDV infection, except lower serum albumin levels (p= 0.004). Although the data of this study revealed a statistically significant positive correlation between chronic HDV infection and anticardiolipin antibodies, it is clear that there is a need for further studies on this subject."
9239,0.004,4.0,"The prevalence of hepatitis virus markers in patients with chronic liver diseases from two countries has been studied: 68 patients (38 alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis, 30 chronic HBsAg-positive hepatitis) from Hungary as well as 109 patients (55 alcoholic liver disease, 45 chronic hepatitis or cryptogenic cirrhosis and 9 hepatoma) from Romania were examined for HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, anti-HCV and anti-HDV, using the corresponding Abbott Elisa test systems. In alcoholic liver disease HBsAg occurred in 6/38 patients from Hungary and in 22/55 patients respectively, that is HBV markers occurred with significantly higher frequency in alcoholic patients from Romania (p less than 0.05). In the Hungarian group a total of 36 patients were HBsAg positive and out of them 5 had anti-HDV (13.9%), while out of 21 Romania HBsAg carriers 10 patients had anti-HDV (47.6%). Among 9 hepatoma patients 4 had HBsAg, 6 anti-HBs and 7 anti-HBc and 4 had anti-HCV and 3 had anti-HDV. One patient with hepatoma had both HBsAg and anti-HCV plus anti-HDV as well. Results suggest that the infection with hepatitis viruses in alcoholic liver diseases is more common in Romania than in Hungary, and the prevalence of delta virus infection in HBV carriers is also significantly higher in Romania than in Hungary."
8027,0.004,4.0,"Parasitic infections continue to take their toll on HIV positive patients by influencing the blood qualitatively and quantitatively. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in relation to anaemia and CD4 counts among HIV-infected patients in Benin City, Nigeria. Using a serial sampling method, a total of 2000 HIV-infected patients were recruited on their first visit prior to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital from August 2007 to August 2009. Stool and blood samples were collected from each patient. The stool samples were processed using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique to microscopically identify the oocysts of Cryptosporidium species, Isospora belli, Cyclospora species and spores of Microsporidium species while saline and iodine preparations were used for identifying the ova, cysts and parasites of Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Taenia spp and other parasites. The blood specimens were equally analyzed using the flow cytometry for CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and autoanalyzer - sysmex kx - 21 for haemoglobin concentration. The overall prevalence of anaemia was 93.3% while 18% had parasitic infections. There was a significant relationship between CD4 count <200cells/microL and anaemia (P<0.0001). Cryptosporidium species (P= 0.005), A. lumbricoides (P=0.035), hookworm and Taenia species (P=0.014) were associated with anaemia. Anaemia was associated with CD4 count while Cryptosporidium species, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species were the intestinal parasitic agents associated with anaemia. In conclusion the prevalence of anaemia in HIV-infected patients is high low CD4 count is a significant risk factor of acquiring anaemia. Except for isosporiasis, cryptosporidiosis, A. lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species in HIV infected individuals are parasitic agents associated with anaemia. Routine screening for intestinal parasites and holistic management of anaemia is advocated."

198,0.004,4.0,"Antiviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) through daily drug administration can protect healthy individuals from HIV-1 infection. While PrEP was recently approved by the FDA, the potential long-term consequences of PrEP implementation remain entirely unclear. The aim of this study is to predict the efficacy of different prophylactic strategies with the pro-drug tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate (TDF) and to assess the sensitivity towards timing- and mode of TDF administration (daily- vs. single dose), adherence and the number of transmitted viruses. We developed a pharmacokinetic model for TDF and its active anabolite tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) and validated it with data from 4 different trials, including 4 distinct dosing regimes. Pharmacokinetics were coupled to an HIV model and viral decay following TDF mono-therapy was predicted, consistent with available data. Subsequently, a stochastic approach was used to estimate the % infections prevented by (i) daily TDF-based PrEP, (ii) one week TDF started either shortly before, or -after viral exposure and (iii) a single dose oral TDF before viral challenge (sd-PrEP). Analytical solutions were derived to assess the relation between intracellular TFV-DP concentrations and prophylactic efficacy. The predicted efficacy of TDF was limited by a slow accumulation of active compound (TFV-DP) and variable TFV-DP half-life and decreased with increasing numbers of transmitted viruses. Once daily TDF-based PrEP yielded [Formula: see text]80% protection, if at least 40% of pills were taken. Sd-PrEP with 300 mg or 600 mg TDF could prevent [Formula: see text]50% infections, when given at least before virus exposure. The efficacy dropped to [Formula: see text]10%, when given 1 h before 24 h exposure. Efficacy could not be increased with increasing dosage or prolonged administration. Post-exposure prophylaxis poorly prevented infection. The use of drugs that accumulate more rapidly, or local application of tenofovir gel may overcome the need for drug administration long before virus exposure."
5185,0.004,4.0,"In Taiwan the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier rate is 15% to 20%. Mother infant transmission plays the most important role in the endemy resulting in 20% of the children being HBsAg carrier at 4 years of age. A large proportion of HBV carriers will develop a chronic hepatitis leading to cirrhosis and ultimately to primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Children born to HBsAg +/HBeAg + mothers (7% of neonates) have an estimated risk of 90% to become HBsAg chronic carriers. A plan for control of Hepatitis B in Taiwan will aim to solve the problem of these children, as a priority. A Hepatitis B vaccine trial has been undertaken in Taiwan since October 1981 in a selected population of children born to HBsAg +/HBeAg + mothers. The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of Hepatitis B vaccine alone or in combination with Hepatitis B immunoglobulin in preventing maternal infant transmission of HBV infection. A three way prophylactic regimen comparison was carried out. Subjects consisted of children born to HBsAg +/HBeAg + mothers. Only mature and apparently healthy neonates were included with the parents' formal consent based on real knowledge and understanding. Babies were randomly included in four different groups of study."
4664,0.004,4.0,"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic has become a major global public health problem with rising number of cases and associated deaths. Most of the present activities in developing countries, especially in Africa, are aimed at reducing the transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Care for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is essential not only to mitigate the impacts of HIV/AIDS among PLWHA but is also an important component of prevention of the disease. There is now a general recognition that comprehensive care across the continuum should be provided to PLWHA through all the stages of infection, with a crucial role for community-home based care activities. In addition, AIDS orphans need to be supported Although, documented evidences abound on the utility of comprehensive care and community-home based care approaches outside Africa and in some African countries, there is little information on them in Nigeria. This paper therefore reviews the recent epidemiology of HIV infection, the many currently developed initiatives to deliver comprehensive care for PLWHA in the hospital, community and at home, and the issue of AIDS orphans. In addition, measures to effectively integrate them into the mainstream of societal activities are discussed."
7829,0.004,4.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic continues to grow at an alarming rate, with a further 5 million new infections in 2003. Some 3.5 million of these were in sub-Saharan Africa, where approximately 70% of the world's HIV-positive population resides. In contrast, the spread of HIV in high-income countries has slowed since its discovery in the 1980s, and in regions such as Western Europe prevalence has decreased. Here, we employ coalescent methods to compare the epidemic growth rates of two subtypes of HIV-1 with differing epidemiological profiles: subtype C, which is dominant in sub-Saharan Africa and associated with heterosexual transmission, and subtype B, the main cause of AIDS in Western Europe and North America, and which was primarily transmitted through homosexual sex and injecting drug use. We show that although both subtypes emerged at approximately the same time ( approximately 1960), they have widely differing patterns of exponential population growth. At its current growth rate the epidemic of subtype C in sub-Saharan Africa is doubling every 2.4 years, which is approximately half the rate observed during the early stages of the subtype B epidemic in Western Europe and North America. However, the subtype C growth rate is still 5-10 times greater than that estimated for the blood-borne hepatitis C virus, supporting the hypothesis that sexual transmission has been primarily responsible for the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa."
5575,0.004,4.0,"The effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on progression of hepatic fibrosis in hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection with HIV are not well understood and are difficult to measure because of the need for repeated liver biopsy. We evaluated the evolution of a noninvasive measure of liver fibrosis, the alanine aspartyl transferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), longitudinally and determined its predictive value for hepatic outcomes in HIV-positive patients with and without HCV coinfection. A total of 673 HIV-positive patients without liver complications at baseline (540 with HIV only, 133 with HIV-HCV coinfection) were followed between 1991 and 2004 for a median of 4.6 years (3524 person-years). At baseline, HIV-HCV coinfection had a higher median APRI compared with HIV infection alone (0.59 vs. 0.33; P < 0.0001). The natural logarithm of the APRI [ln(APRI)] changed significantly over time, particularly among patients with HIV-HCV coinfection. The baseline ln(APRI) was predictive of liver complications (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5 to 6.4 per log), as was HCV (HR = 4.5, 95% CI: 1.5 to 14). Cumulative HAART did not protect against liver complications, although it was significantly associated with progression of APRI scores in HIV-HCV coinfection and in HIV alone. In conclusion, the APRI may be a useful marker for longitudinal evaluation of the progression of liver disease in HIV-HCV coinfection."

Low CD4+ cell counts may result in false-negative results on all diagnostic tests except hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA assays, which are the gold standard for viral replication. First-line management of HIV-HCV--coinfected patients should be optimization of HAART, because low CD4+ cell counts have been associated with greater fibrosis. In addition, agents used to treat hepatitis C may lower CD4+ cell counts and hemoglobin levels. Long-acting interferons offer the promise of better sustained HCV response in HIV-HCV coinfection."

407,0.004,4.0,"The interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef with p21-activated kinase 2 (Pak2) has been proposed to play an important role in T-cell activation and disease progression during viral infection. However, the mechanism by which Nef activates Pak2 is poorly understood. Mutations in most Nef motifs previously reported to be required for Pak2 activation (G2, PxxP72, and RR105) also affect other Nef functions, such as CD4 or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) downregulation. To better understand Nef interactions with Pak2, we performed mutational analysis of three primary HIV-1 Nef clones that exhibited similar capacities for downregulation of CD4 and MHC-I but variable abilities to associate with activated Pak2. Our results demonstrate that Nef amino acids at positions 85, 89, 187, 188, and 191 (L, H, S, R, and F in the clade B consensus, respectively) are critical for Pak2 association. Mutation of these Nef residues dramatically altered association with Pak2 without affecting Nef expression levels or CD4 and MHC-I downregulation. Furthermore, compensation occurred at positions 89 and 191 when both amino acids were substituted. Since residues 85, 89, 187, 188, and 191 cluster on the surface of the Nef core domain in a region distinct from the dimerization and SH3-binding domains, we propose that these Nef residues form part of a unique binding surface specifically involved in association with Pak2. This binding surface includes exposed and recessed hydrophobic residues and may participate in an as-yet-unidentified protein-protein interaction to facilitate Pak2 activation."
4466,0.004,4.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health issue worldwide. Several factors including core gene variation are responsible for the development of chronicity of HBV infection. The present study was designed to identify the variations in the core region of the HBV genome in a local population of chronic hepatitis B patients (n = 57) using a PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Fifty subjects were found to be positive for the presence of HBV DNA. For the core region genotyping, the Ava II and Msp I restriction enzymes were used. Mutations at nucleotide (nt) 2147 and nt 2362 in the HBV genome in the core region for Ava II (A4 type, 74%) and nt 2331 for Msp I (M1 type, 66%) were observed as the most common pattern. These results are different from those of previously reported studies on other populations and thus appear to be unique to the Pakistani population. This type of characterization of core mutants may be useful for the design of vaccines based on viral epitopes that are effective for the Pakistani population. Moreover, these unique genotypic patterns for the HBV core gene might be some of the main factors responsible for understanding the underlying mechanism by which HBV chronicity is developed in the Pakistani population."
3809,0.004,4.0,"Occult Hepatitis B Infection (OBI) is a form of chronic HBV infection characterized by low level HBV DNA, without detectable HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). OBI is frequently associated with the presence of anti-HBc and in some cases also with anti-HBs. Patients, who formerly received non-inactivated factor concentrates, can potentially be considered at high risk for OBI, especially since these patients usually are HIV or HCV co-infected. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of occult HBV infection in Greek patients with hereditary bleeding disorders. The study sample comprised of 114 patients from a single haemophilia center. All patients were screened for HBV serum markers and individually tested for HBV DNA using a qualitative PCR. Presence of HBV DNA was further confirmed by quantification of viral load with an ultrasensitive in-house real time PCR. 88 and 21 patients with haemophilia A and B, respectively, 4 patients with von Willebrand Disease and 1 patient with severe factor VII deficiency were screened for the presence of OBI. Anti-HBc were detected in 53 (46.5%) subjects; 18 of them were anti-HBs(-) and 35 anti-HBs(+). Anti-HBe were present in 26 subjects. Two out of 114 patients were HBsAg(+). Of the remaining 112 HBsAg(-) patients tested, two (1.8%) were found HBsAg(-), HBV DNA(+), anti-HBc(+) and anti-HBs(-) and were identified as potential OBI cases. Both cases exhibited very low DNA levels; 38.2IU/mL in patient A and 14.2IU/mL in patient B. Both patients were HBeAg(-), but patient A had HBe antibodies. Patient B was also HIV/HCV co-infected. In conclusion, two cases of OBI with low HBV viraemia were identified among patients with congenital bleeding disorders. Although the incidence in our sample is moderately low (1.8%), close monitoring of these infections is of great clinical significance, especially in patients with co-infections and concomitant immunosuppression."
8986,0.004,4.0,"Characterization of residual plasma virus during antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a high priority to improve understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis and therapy. To understand the evolution of HIV-1 pol and env genes in viremic patients under selective pressure of ART, we performed longitudinal analyses of plasma-derived pol and env sequences from single HIV-1 genomes. We tested the hypotheses that drug resistance in pol was unrelated to changes in coreceptor usage (tropism), and that recombination played a role in evolution of viral strains. Recombinants were identified by using Bayesian and other computational methods. High-level genotypic resistance was seen in approximately 70% of X4 and R5 strains during ART. There was no significant association between resistance and tropism. Each patient displayed at least one recombinant encompassing env and representing a change in predicted tropism. These data suggest that, in addition to mutation, recombination can play a significant role in shaping HIV-1 evolution."

Using the lowest and highest infectious clones of HIV obtained by the plaque-cloning method, a clear consistent synergism of infectivity and cytopathic effects was detected when different cell lines were coinfected with a mixture of the two clones. These data suggest that the emergence of a highly infectious variant of HIV due to mutation may modify the infectivity of a minimally infectious latent variant with the final progression of HIV infection to overt AIDS."

4576,0.004,4.0,"In 2004, Cambodia, a low-income country, undertook a rapid scale-up of free antiretroviral therapy (ART) through the public sector in order to respond to the need for treatment for those living with HIV/AIDS. A cohort of patients initiating ART in a provincial national hospital was set up at the beginning of the program to monitor the impact of treatment on patients. Patients provided information on behaviors through face-to-face interviews. Medical data were obtained from clinical files. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study 21-Items Short Form (MOS SF-21). Patients were interviewed when initiating ART and followed up at 3 months, 6 months, and each consecutive 6 months thereafter. From March 2005 through January 2008, the cohort included 549 patients followed for a total of 645 person-years. The 4.0% of patients lost to follow-up were considered dead in the analysis. Incidence of mortality was 9.1 per 100 person-years, which is comparable to international standards. HRQOL subscale scores increased dramatically in the first year after initiating ART. The mean of overall HRQOL score rose from 63.0 at baseline to 81.1 at 1 year and 89.9 at 30 months of follow-up (chi(2) for trends p < 0.001). Simultaneously, the proportion of patients with full-time employment increased from 48.8% to 95.7%.We conclude that the rapid scaling-up of ART delivery in a resource poor Asian setting dramatically improved the survival and well-being of its beneficiaries, who in turn resumed productive lives within their communities."
258,0.004,4.0,"Several members of the seven-transmembrane chemokine receptor family have been shown to serve, with CD4, as coreceptors for entry by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). While coreceptor usage by HIV-1 primary isolates has been studied by several groups, there is only limited information available concerning coreceptor usage by primary HIV-2 isolates. In this study, we have analyzed coreceptor usage of 15 primary HIV-2 isolates, using lymphocytes from a donor with nonfunctional CCR5 (CCR5 -/-; homozygous 32-bp deletion). Based on the infections of PBMCs, seven of these primary isolates had an absolute requirement for CCR5 expression, whereas the remaining eight exhibited a broader coreceptor usage. All CCR5-requiring isolates were non-syncytium inducing, whereas isolates utilizing multiple coreceptors were syncytium inducing. Blocking experiments using known ligands for chemokine receptors provided indirect evidence for additional coreceptor utilization by primary HIV-2 isolates. Analysis of GHOST4 cell lines expressing various chemokine receptors (CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR4, BONZO, and BOB) further defined specific coreceptor usage of primary HIV-2 isolates. The receptors used included CXCR4, CCR1-5, and the recently described receptors BONZO and BOB. However, the efficiency at which the coreceptors were utilized varied greatly among the various isolates. Analysis of V3 envelope sequences revealed no specific motif that correlated with coreceptor usage. Our data demonstrate that primary HIV-2 isolates are capable of using a broad range of coreceptors for productive infection in vitro. Additionally, our data suggest that expanded coreceptor usage by HIV-2 may correlate with disease progression."

3856,0.004,4.0,"Because milk-borne transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diminishes the benefits of perinatal antiviral drug therapy in developing countries, we have developed a new strategy to prevent postnatal and, possibly, intrapartum virus transmission in a primate model. Eight neonatal rhesus macaques were exposed orally to pathogenic simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV); 4 neonates were then given intramuscular postexposure prophylaxis with 3 anti-HIV human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nMAbs) with potent cross-clade and cross-group neutralization activity. Untreated infants experienced high viral RNA levels and CD4(+) T-cell losses and died (median survival time, 5.5 weeks). In contrast, all 4 nMAb-treated neonates were protected from infection (P=.028); their plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and lymph nodes remained virus negative for >1 year. These data are important for designing clinical trials in human neonates and have general implications for AIDS vaccine development, as the epitopes recognized by the 3 nMAbs are conserved among diverse primary isolates."
4663,0.004,4.0,"Most studies of the medical costs of HIV infection focus on the terminal stage of this chronic illness when the patients have developed AIDS or severe HIV disease and in-patient care dominates. Data are also needed on the medical costs during the prolonged phase of HIV infection preceding severe terminal illness and the effects it may have on the provision of outpatient care. The study population was derived from a cohort study of factory workers and their spouses in Tanzania. Morbidity and outpatient health services utilization are estimated for 1832 adults who on average had been enrolled for two years and utilized the study clinic. Among those who had been enrolled at least 2 years, 50 cases (HIV+ since enrollment) and 150 control (HIV- until last visit) were selected, matched by age, sex and income level to estimate expenditure on drugs by HIV status. There was an increase in morbidity during HIV infection: the incidence of clinical diagnoses was 30% higher among HIV-positive than among HIV-negative adults (p < 0.001). HIV-infected adults also made more frequent use of the outpatient services (23% higher utilization). Estimates of essential drug costs among the subsample showed a 15% increase for HIV infected adults compared to HIV-negative adults, caused by higher use of antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs. The overall increase in morbidity, outpatient care services utilization and essential drug use due to HIV infection was limited, as HIV prevalence in this adult population was 11%. For example, the net proportion of all illness episodes attributable to HIV infection was 3.2%. Possible biases are discussed and suggest that our findings are a minimum estimate of the effect of adult HIV infection on outpatient care costs. There is a need for more studies in different settings to assess the impact of HIV infection on outpatient care in developing countries."
7849,0.004,4.0,"Two hundred and seventy-three serum specimens from hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers were examined for the presence of a characteristic one point mutation at nucleotide (nt) 1896 from the EcoRI site of the HBV genome in the precore region (the preC mutant) using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. This assay approach could detect preC mutants or wild-type sequences when either form constituted more than 10% of the total sample. Overall, 65.5% (76/116) of HBeAg-positive carriers had only the preC wild-type. All HBeAg-positive asymptomatic carriers (n = 14) had only the preC wild-type. In patients with chronic hepatitis B and in anti-HBe-positive asymptomatic carriers, increased prevalence of the preC mutant was associated with the development of anti-HBe antibodies and normalization of the serum alanine aminotransferase concentration. Furthermore, 27 (29.0%) of 93 HBeAg-negative carriers had unexpectedly preC wild-type sequences only. Direct sequencing of the HBV precore region of HBV specimens from 24 patients revealed no mutation at nt 1896, supporting the specificity of the RFLP analysis. These results suggest that RFLP analysis was accurate for the detection of the preC mutation and that the absence of serum HBeAg cannot be explained solely by the dominance of the preC mutant."
9205,0.004,4.0,"This paper examines factors associated with adherence to antiretroviral medications (ARVs) in an HIV-infected population at high risk for non-adherence: individuals living with psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. Data were examined from baseline interviews of a multisite cohort intervention study of 1138 HIV-infected adults with both a psychiatric and substance abuse disorder (based on a structured psychiatric research interview using DSM-IV criteria). The baseline interview documented mental illness and substance use in the past year, mental illness and substance abuse severity, demographics, service utilization in the past three months, general health and HIV-related conditions, self-reported spirituality and self-reported ARV medication use. Among the participants, 62% were prescribed ARVs at baseline (n = 542) and 45% of those on ARVs reported skipping medications in the past three days. Reports of non-adherence were significantly associated with having a detectable viral load (p<.01). The factors associated with non-adherence were current drug and alcohol abuse, increased psychological distress, less attendance at medical appointments, non-adherence to psychiatric medications and lower self-reported spirituality. Increased psychological distress was significantly associated with non-adherence, independent of substance abuse (p<.05). The data suggest that both mental illness and substance use must be addressed in HIV-infected adults living with these co-morbid illnesses to improve adherence to ARVs."
835,0.004,4.0,"Many hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients are also infected with HIV, and undergo antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Due to changes in HIV burden and immunologic status, HIV ARV treatment may have indirect effects on the HCV population, which could impact the effectiveness of subsequent HCV protease inhibitor (PI) treatment. The genetic variability of the protease-encoding HCV NS3 gene was evaluated in 10 co-infected patients initiating ARVs (both before and after ARV initiation), and compared to the genetic variability in 10 patients on stable ARV therapy. After RT-PCR of plasma-derived HCV RNA, a mean of 20 clones per patient time-point were sequenced and analyzed for changes in the HCV quasispecies population. No significant differences in sequence diversity or complexity at the nucleic acid or amino acid levels were seen at baseline between groups or between the two time points in either group. HCV protease diversity in the pre- and post-ARV treatment samples was not significantly different than samples from patients on stable ARV therapy. There was no significant development of amino acid substitutions known to confer HCV PI resistance in either group. Initiation of ARV for HIV infection does not significantly alter the genetic diversity or complexity of the HCV NS3 gene or result in increased number of HCV PI-associated amino acid changes. These results suggest ARV treatment for HIV would not affect the efficacy of HCV PI treatment."

Cumulative incidence of AIDS and standard error were calculated using non parametric life table method. Age, sex, acute infection and splenectomy associations with progression to AIDS were tested using Breslow statistic. The median follow-up period was 4 years 11 months. At the end of the study period, 43 TMP were in CDC stage II, 23 in CDC stage III and 13 in CDC stage IV, including seven AIDS cases, of whom three had died. Four subjects died of other causes. Only two patients were treated with AZT prior to the occurrence of AIDS. Rate of progression to AIDS was not associated with acute infection, splenectomy, age, or sex.

8661,0.004,4.0,"Candida albicans has been shown to vary in its phenotypic expression with the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Isolates of C. albicans were obtained from 45 patients with HIV infection during the progression of their disease and differentiated using two methods. The first utilized the morphological characteristics of colonies, and the second method utilized a small portion of C. albicans DNA as a probe on Southern-transferred, EcoRI-digested C. albicans genomic DNA. In 67% of the patients a single strain of C. albicans, as determined by the DNA analysis, was isolated from each individual. The phenotypic expression of the genetically identical strains varied considerably over the experimental period with one morphotype being predominant. These results showed that the genotype of C. albicans persisted in the majority of HIV-infected individuals, but that the phenotypical expression of this strain changed. A novel finding in this study was that 18 strains of C. albicans had DNA which did not hybridize to the probe used."

Addition of TCC108 cells or CD8(+) reverse transcriptase-specific CTLs to HLA-matched CD4(+) T cells at different times after infection with HIV-1 IIIB showed that infected cells became susceptible to CTL-mediated lysis before peak virus production but after the onset of progeny virus release. When either of these CTLs were added to part of the infected cells immediately after infection, p55 expression and virus production were significantly suppressed. These data support a model in which CTLs, apart from exerting cytolytic activity which may prevent continued virus release, can interfere with viral protein expression during the eclipse phase via noncytolytic mechanisms. TCC108-mediated inhibition of virus replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells caused rapid selection of a virus with a mutation (69E-->K) in the Rev(67-75) CTL epitope which abolished recognition by TCC108 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that both cytolytic and noncytolytic antiviral mechanisms of CTLs can be specifically targeted to HIV-1-infected cells."
6822,0.004,4.0,"Serial determinations of titers of binding antibodies to single stranded DNA were performed over a period of three years in 43 type B hepatitis patients with persisting HBsAg who had either developed chronic hepatitis or were asymptomatic carriers. Patients with histopathological diagnosis of chronic active or chronic persistent hepatitis, with or without clinical symptoms, showed high titers of anti-DNA throughout the course of the disease, whereas in most of these patients the serum alanine transaminase and bilirubin levels fluctuated widely and were often normal; in such cases the elevation of anti-DNA was frequently the only positive sign present. On the other hand anti-DNA titers were within the normal range in chronic asymptomatic HBsAg carriers who showed no histopathological or biochemical changes. Anti-DNA determinations are proposed as a reliable diagnostic aid to supplement current procedures for assessment of the disease status during the course of chronic hepatitis B virus infections."
8318,0.004,4.0,"The relevance of CD4+T-cells, viral load and age in the immunological response to influenza infection and vaccination in HIV-1 infected individuals has previously been pointed out. Our study aimed at assessing, in the setting of 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza vaccination, whether quantification of activation-induced deaminase (AID) expression in blood B-cells may provide additional indications for predicting antibody response to vaccination in HIV-1 infected patients with similar CD4+T-cell counts and age. Forty-seven healthy controls, 37 ART-treated and 17 treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients were enrolled in the study. Blood was collected prior to A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination and at 1, 3 and 6 months after vaccination. Antibody titers to A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine were measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay while the mRNA expression levels of AID were measured by quantitative real time PCR. Upon B-cell activation in vitro, AID increase correlated to antibody response to the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine at 1 month after vaccination in all individuals. In addition, the maximum expression levels of AID were significantly higher in those individuals who still carried protective levels of A(H1N1)pdm09 antibodies after 6 months from vaccination. No correlation was found between CD4+T-cell counts or age at vaccination or HIV-1 viral load and levels of A(H1N1)pdm09 antibodies. Assessing AID expression before vaccination may be an additional useful tool for defining a vaccination strategy in immune-compromised individuals at risk of immunization failure."

2564,0.004,4.0,"The use of gallium scanning in the treatment of patients with AIDS has been well described. In this study, 27 HIV-infected patients (Walter Reed Staging Classification I-V) with normal chest roentgenograms were evaluated to determine the occurrence of thoracic gallium abnormalities in early HIV infection. SPECT was used for gallium scanning. Patients received gallium injection on day 1 and bronchoalveolar lavage on day 2, and scanning was performed on day 3. Twenty-eight scans in 27 patients were performed. Mean nodal SPECT activity was compared with corresponding values for lung parenchyma, bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts, and peripheral blood T4 lymphocyte counts. No relationship between nodal and parenchymal activity and cell counts was observed. Although visual scan interpretation was unaffected, gallium activity was significantly increased in the region of bronchoalveolar lavage compared with uptake in other lung regions. It is concluded that SPECT gallium scanning demonstrates significant gallium avidity in recently lavaged lung areas, although no impact on visual scan interpretation was seen. Further, no correlation was seen between the degree of nodal uptake and the immunologic status of these patients with early HIV infection."
9081,0.004,4.0,"High level adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is required to achieve and maintain suppression of HIV replication. Although directly observed therapy (DOT) has been suggested as an intervention to improve adherence, there is a paucity of data describing the attitudes and beliefs regarding DOT for ART among HIV-infected individuals. This study was designed to evaluate the acceptability and psychometric properties of a survey instrument for use in assessing barriers and facilitators of adherence to ART DOT in prison. From July 1, 1999 to April 1, 2000, we piloted an interviewer-administered questionnaire to assess health beliefs and attitudes regarding HIV treatment among 65 HIV-infected prison inmates receiving one or more of their antiretrovirals via directly observed therapy (DOT). The first 24 participants were administered the questionnaire to determine the feasibility of surveying prisoners in a correctional setting. There were no adherence data collected on these participants. The remaining 41 participants had their adherence measured in addition to receiving the questionnaire. Thirty-one were included in the final analysis because 10 did not complete the study. Multiple antiretroviral adherence measures (electronic device medication monitoring [eDEM] caps, medication administration records [MARs], and pill counts) were assessed among a subset of the participants (n = 31) and correlated to the instrument response items. The median internal consistency reliability coefficient for the multi-item scales was 0.79. The strongest correlation between inmates' beliefs and their adherence was between ""positive beliefs about protease inhibitors"" and the MAR adherence measure (r = 0.72; p < 0.001). This study provides preliminary support for the psychometric properties of the survey in this correctional setting."
7720,0.004,4.0,"This study was conducted in order to help determine the key factors that predict adherence to antiretroviral medications. A total of 115 HIV/AIDS patients who were having trouble adhering to their antiretroviral regimens completed face-to-face interviews in which adherence levels, medication side effects, mental health, social support, patient-provider relationship characteristics, substance use and health anxiety were assessed. Three measures of adherence were used: adherence over the past three days, adherence over the past week, and adherence over the past month. Logistic regression analyses indicated strongest prediction of three-day adherence, with mental health, social support, patient-provider relationship characteristics and side effects contributing to prediction. Past week adherence was associated with age and social support measures, and showed a marginal association with side effects. Past month adherence was less strongly predicted, with social support and alcohol use contributing to prediction. Thus, a variety of factors were found to determine adherence, and implications of the findings for adherence models and interventions are discussed."
3845,0.004,4.0,"Adherence to treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with the successful eradication of infection. However, patients often have difficulty adhering to HCV treatment because of factors such as the psychiatric side effects of regimens and social disadvantage. Commonly, health professionals including specialist physicians, nurses, social workers and psychologists work together under a multidisciplinary model of shared-care to support patients' adherence to HCV treatment. In some HCV treatment clinics, shared-care is not always available, or only partially implemented and this has implications for patient adherence. To explore the facilitators of adherence, an interview-based study was conducted in 2012 with a purposive sample of Australian physicians and nurses (N = 20). The findings reveal that when comprehensive shared-care was limited or unavailable, physicians and nurses filled in the gaps by assuming roles outside of their expertise to help patients adhere to HCV treatment. Physicians and nurses applied instrumental support strategies based on psychosocial interventions, namely patient advocacy, pragmatic problem-solving, treatment engagement and emotional support. These strategies were provided by dedicated physicians and nurses to address shortfalls in multidisciplinary shared-care. Although these interventions were reported to assist adherence, there is an increased risk of complications when physicians and nurses move beyond the bounds of their disciplinary training, for example, to assess and manage patients' psychiatric side effects or advocate on their behalf for social services. Future research should measure the effectiveness of instrumental support strategies on HCV treatment adherence, and explore the costs associated with physicians and nurses providing instrumental support in the absence of comprehensive multidisciplinary shared-care."
5168,0.004,4.0,"The present study examined the comparative efficacy of intervening at the caregiver/care-recipient dyadic level, versus the individual caregiver level, for caregivers and their care-recipients with HIV/AIDS. Participants were randomly assigned to a Dyad Intervention (DI), a Caregiver Intervention (CI) or Wait List Control group (WLC), and assessed by interview and self-administered scales immediately before treatment and eight weeks later. Participants in the intervention groups also completed a four-month follow-up assessment. Dependent variables included global distress, social adjustment, dyadic adjustment, subjective health status, HIV/AIDS knowledge and target problem ratings. Results showed that caregivers in the DI group showed greater improvement from pre- to post-treatment on global distress, dyadic adjustment and target problems than the CI and WLC caregivers. The CI and DI caregivers showed greater improvement than the WLC group on all dependent variables except social adjustment. Care-recipients in the DI group improved significantly from pre- to post-treatment on dyadic adjustment, social adjustment, knowledge, subjective health status and Target Problem 1, whereas the CI and WLC care-recipients failed to improve on any of these measures. The treatment gains made by the DI caregivers and care-recipients on most dependent variables were maintained at a four-month follow-up. Findings support a reciprocal determinism approach to the process of dyadic adjustment and suggest that intervening at the caregiver/care-recipient level may produce better outcomes for both the caregiver and care-recipient than intervening at the individual caregiver level."

Only 13 cases of vesical carcinoma have been reported to date in the setting of HIV infection, but only 3 anecdotal single reports (the last in the y 2001) described clinical, therapeutic, and outcome issues of this rare disease association in some detail. In our patients, micro- or macro-haematuria was the clue for in-depth diagnosis and prompt treatment, which was limited to multiple local interventions in 1 case, but finally required a radical cystectomy in the second patient.

6894,0.004,4.0,"The complexity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) immunopathogenesis has prompted multiple strategic approaches to re-establish normal immune responses. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can control viral replication, but it is unable to restore HIV-specific immunity. Newer approaches for managing HIV infection are focusing on cell-mediated immune responses, including the potential for improved immunologic control over HIV replication. Cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-12, are being evaluated for their ability to enhance cell-mediated immunity, which is thought to be critical for immunologic control. Initial studies with IL-2 have demonstrated an improvement in CD4 cell counts, and large randomized trials are underway to determine the long-term clinical efficacy of IL-2 in combination with antiretroviral therapy, including HAART. Stimulating the immune response against HIV by use of exogenous (therapeutic vaccination) or endogenous (structured treatment interruption) antigens with or without immune adjuvants or cytokines, such as IL-2, is another approach currently being explored."
6955,0.004,4.0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has fundamentally changed the clinical outcome of HIV infection and AIDS. However, the emergence of drug-resistant HIV variants is a barrier to successful use of HAART, with resistance to one drug often resulting in cross-resistance to many, if not all, others in the same class. The rise in the incidence of drug-resistant variants among newly infected patients also represents a formidable challenge for clinicians. Failure of the current HAART regimen due to drug resistance can severely limit second-line, third-line, and salvage treatment options. Although inadequate exposure of the virus to antiretroviral agents is a prime reason for the emergence of HIV drug-resistant variants, poor adherence to complicated regimens and variability in drug pharmacokinetics (PK), both within and between HIV-infected individuals, can also affect the overall efficacy of antiretroviral agents, promoting emergence of resistant HIV variants. Recent strategies to optimize antiretroviral drug regimens, including assessment of HIV genotype and/or phenotype, the use of protease inhibitor regimens that incorporate PK boosting, and scheduled treatment interruptions, have been explored. Additionally, several newer antiretroviral agents that produce rapid and sustained virologic and immunologic responses as well as novel resistance profiles (e.g. atazanavir and tenofovir) have become available. These characteristics thus increase the likelihood of durable viral suppression."
1676,0.004,4.0,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) replicates via an error-prone reverse transcriptase generating potential drug-resistant quasispecies. The degree of HBV variability in liver vs peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients on long-term suppressive antivirals is unclear. We characterized HBV replication, drug resistance and molecular diversity in patients with plasma HBV DNA undetectable by clinical assays. Explant liver (n=9), PBMC (n=6) and plasma (n=7) from nine such patients undergoing liver transplantation were evaluated for HBV genomes by sensitive PCR/nucleic acid hybridization assay. Cases with HBV DNA in liver and PBMC were tested for covalently closed circular DNA (HBV cccDNA). HBV polymerase (P) amplicons were cloned, sequenced and both P and overlapping surface (S) gene sequences were analysed. HBV DNA was detected in 43% (3/7) of plasma, 100% (9/9) of liver and 83% (5/6) of PBMC samples. HBV cccDNA was detected in all liver and one PBMC sample. Four patients had a clinical diagnosis of resistance. HBV P gene sequencing revealed 100% wild type (wt) in plasma (2/2), 83% wt in PBMC (5/6) but livers of 3/9 (33%) contained wt and 6/9 (66%) carried resistance to lamivudine and/or adefovir. The translated S gene revealed no changes affecting HBV antigenicity. Sequences from livers with antiviral resistant mutants revealed greater interpatient quasispecies diversity. Despite apparent HBV suppression, the liver continues to support HBV replication and extrahepatic HBV can be detected. PBMC may be a sanctuary for wt virus during antiviral therapy, while the liver harbours more drug-resistant viruses. Drug resistance correlates with intrahepatic viral diversity."

Among 432 patients failing antiretroviral therapy, five (1.15%) harboured viruses with Q151M mutation into the RT gene and no viruses were identified harbouring insertion at codon 69. Also we have studied the long-term benefit of HIV genotypic testing with the failure to reach a viral load below 50 copies/ml within 1 year of antiretroviral therapy using as the primary end-point. A group of 64 HIV-positive antiretroviral multiexperienced patients were examined, all of them failing the current ART. HIV-RNA changed -0.8 log at month 4 and +0.1 log and -0.5 log at months 8 and 12, respectively. The proportion of patients with viral load below 50 copies/ml was 19.3, 32.8, and 28.1% at months 4, 8, and 12, respectively. In multidrug-experienced patients, genotype-guided therapy is not in fact able to achieve complete viral suppression in more than 30% of patients after 1 year of ART. The development of more precise resistance tests and interpretations are needed for better control of HIV replication. Other metabolic/pharmacokinetics factors of poor drug adherence should also be assessed."
2104,0.004,4.0,"Barriers to retention in HIV care are detrimental to patients' progress along the HIV continuum of care. Previous literature has focused on individual, client-level barriers, and interventions to address them. In contrast, less work has examined the role of system-level barriers on HIV care outcomes. This study seeks to understand how individual and systemic barriers individually are associated with clinic appointment attendance and virologic suppression in HIV-infected patients attending the largest HIV clinic in Miami-Dade, FL. In addition, we examined the synergistic effects of these barriers as potential syndemic factors on these health outcomes. Barriers to clinic attendance were determined in a face-to-face study interview with 444 HIV-infected outpatients (187 regular attenders, 191 irregular attenders, and 66 nonattenders) identified from electronic medical records. Compared with the other attendance groups, nonattenders had higher viral loads, were less likely to be virologically suppressed, had lower CD4 counts, had higher depressive symptoms, life chaos, lower quality of life, and higher rates of food insecurity, and recent drug use. Additionally, nonattenders compared with regular attenders had lower physician relationship ratings, had lower medical information clarity and more often reported transportation as a barrier to clinic attendance. When viewed as a syndemic, compared with patients not reporting any barriers, patients with 3 or more individual-level barriers were more likely to have a detectable viral load (odds ratio = 3.60, 95% CI: 1.71 to 7.61). Our findings suggest that patients presenting to the clinic with multiple barriers should be prioritized for assistance and future interventions to improve retention in care. Interventions should address multiple individual and system-level barriers simultaneously with particular attention to addressing depressive symptoms, organizational skills, relationship with the physician, and HIV-related health education.

8952,0.004,4.0,"We have found that novel pyridine oxide derivatives are inhibitors of a wide range of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 strains in CEM cell cultures. Some of the compounds showed inhibitory activities against recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), whereas others were totally inactive against this viral protein in vitro. Partial retention of anti-HIV-1 activity against virus strains that contain a variety of mutations characteristic of those for resistance to nonnucleoside RT inhibitors and a lack of inhibitory activity against recombinant HIV-2 RT suggested that these pyridine oxide derivatives possess a mode of antiviral action independent from HIV RT inhibition. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that these pyridine oxide derivatives interact at a postintegration step in the replication cycle of HIV. Furthermore, it was shown that these compounds are active not only in acutely HIV-1-infected cells but also in chronically HIV-infected cells. A dose-dependent inhibition of virus particle release and viral protein expression was observed upon exposure to the pyridine oxide derivatives. Finally, inhibition of HIV-1 long terminal repeat-mediated green fluorescence protein expression in quantitative transactivation bioassays indicated that the additional target of action of the pyridine oxide derivatives may be located at the level of HIV gene expression."

A prospective time series design was used to assess the rate, severity, and distress of nausea in a cohort of 75 HIV-positive patients who were beginning or changing a combination of two or more antiretroviral medications. Data were collected via telephone at weekly intervals for 12 weeks. The rate of nausea across regimens was greatest at Week 1 (39%) and declined progressively over time. By Week 12, the rate of nausea was only 5%. Severity of nausea was ranked as moderate or severe by a substantial proportion of patients through Week 10; however, nausea severity and distress were also found to diminish over time. The nausea associated with combination antiretroviral therapy is quite common and may adversely affect medication adherence.

8433,0.004,4.0,"In order to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in Royal Australian Navy personnel and to formulate policies for their education, screening and vaccination, a voluntary survey was undertaken. Seven hundred and forty-eight subjects completed a questionnaire that provided details of age, sex, rank, ethnic origin, service abroad, length of service, history of tattooing, liver disease and blood transfusions. Serum was assayed by radioimmunoassay for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (antiHBs) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (antiHBc). The presence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection was correlated with ""risk factors"" by means of the chi 2 test of independence. Fourteen (74%) of 19 personnel from the Pacific Islands, Asia and Africa who were excluded from analysis showed one-or-more such markers. The prevalence of any marker of hepatitis B virus infection was 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9%-5.9%). The individual markers HBsAg, antiHBs and antiHBc were found in 0.4% (95% CI, 0.1%-1.2%), 3.6% (95% CI, 2.2%-4.9%) and 3.9% (95% CI, 2.5%-5.3%) of subjects, respectively. The annual attack rate was estimated to be less than 1%. Factors which had a significant correlation with an increased prevalence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection included tattooing (especially if this had been performed in Asia), age, the duration of service and service abroad. Based on these data, and given the reduced cost of hepatitis B vaccines, vaccination now is considered worth while. A policy of vaccinating all personnel who may be required for service at sea, and others at risk, now is in effect. Educational programmes that are aimed at minimizing the risk of exposure to hepatitis B and other viral infections have been instituted."

HBsAg was not found in any of patients with alcoholic chronic hepatitis and in only two of 18 patients with other forms of chronic liver disease. No significant difference in the incidence of anti-HBs was observed in all groups of patients. According to previous studies our results confirm the higher prevalence of HBV infection in etiology of chronic persistent and aggressive hepatitis and indicate that this prevalence may be observed especially in Middle and South Italy. The presence of HBsAg in the serum of 37.2% of our patients with cirrhosis compared with 9% of reported cases in North Italy suggest that HBV plays an important role in the etiology of cirrhosis of the liver in our area."

We included 160 consecutive HIV-infected patients with a median age of 46 years (range, 27-77), of whom 92% were male, 74% Caucasian, 11% African American, 9% Hispanic, and 6% Asian. Homosexual contact was the main transmission mode. Seventy percent of patients were using combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). In 83% of patients laboratory markers outside the normal range for a non-HIV-infected population were observed. Significant lower levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF; p = 0.03), factor VIII (p < 0.0001), D-dimer (p = 0.01), and ETP (p = 0.01) were observed in HIV-infected patients on cART compared to patients not on cART. Significant lower levels of protein C (p = 0.05) and free protein S (p < 0.0001), and increased APCsr (p < 0.0001) were found in the HIV-infected patients not on cART.

4331,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) coinfect many individuals in North America and in parts of Africa. Infection with HIV is a leading risk factor for the development of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HIV infection of common or adjacent cells would stimulate replication and spread of KSHV. Infection of a primary effusion lymphoma cell line by vesicular stomatitis virus type G-pseudotyped HIV type 1 led to a rapid induction of lytic-phase KSHV replication. Induction of lytic KSHV replication by HIV required active replication of HIV. The addition of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothymidine or the protease inhibitor indinavir to the culture prevented HIV spread and inhibited the associated induction of KSHV lytic replication. Lytic replication occurred in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected cells within the culture, and could be induced in uninfected cells via a soluble factor released from the HIV-infected cells. Transmission of infectious KSHV to an uninfected target cell was enhanced by HIV replication and was inhibited by antiretroviral drugs. These results may have implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of KS in individuals coinfected with KSHV and HIV."

Regardless of hospital type, nursing care paradigms, or testing model, facilities interested in successfully implementing a similar protocol must formulate policies for testing, notification, and treatment as well as consider dedicating a staff member to the program."
3566,0.004,4.0,"In 1994, the US Public Health Service published guidelines for the use of zidovudine to decrease the risk of perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1995, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the US Public Health Service recommended documented, routine HIV education and testing with consent for all pregnant women in the United States. Widespread incorporation of these guidelines into clinical practice has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the rate of perinatal HIV transmission and has contributed to more than a 75% decrease in reported cases of pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) since 1992. Substantial advances have been made in the treatment and monitoring of HIV infection; combination antiretroviral regimens that maximally suppress virus replication are now available. These regimens are recommended for pregnant and nonpregnant individuals who require treatment. Risk factors associated with perinatal HIV transmission are now better understood, and recent results from trials to decrease the rate of mother-to-child HIV transmission have contributed new strategies with established efficacy. However, perinatal HIV transmission still occurs; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 300 to 400 infected infants are born annually. Full implementation of recommendations for universal, routine prenatal HIV testing and evaluation of missed prevention opportunities will be critical to further decrease the incidence of pediatric HIV infection in the United States. This technical report summarizes recent advances in the prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV relevant to screening of pregnant women and their infants."
1219,0.004,4.0,"Nonadherence with medical treatment is a critical threat to the health of those living with HIV disease. Unfortunately the search for explanatory factors for nonadherence is still not fully developed, particularly in the area of religion and spirituality. Extant literature suggests that church attendance, religious practices and spiritual beliefs may improve health and generally benefit patients. However, religious beliefs may also play a negative role in treatment adherence due to the stigma attached to HIV disease, particularly in geographical areas and in population subgroups where religious practices are strong. In this exploratory study, HIV-positive individuals (n = 306) in a southern state were surveyed as to their attitudes and beliefs surrounding HIV disease and adherence with medical treatment for the disease. The results indicate that multiple factors influence adherence with treatment and that certain religious practices are positively associated with adherence, but certain religious beliefs are negatively related to adherence. The findings of this study reinforce the importance of remembering and addressing a patient's religious beliefs as a part of medical care."

Computed tomography scan showed fungus balls in multiple lung cavities and surrounding infiltrates. The patient showed remarkable improvement with voriconazole suggesting aspergillosis. However, the patient was serologically negative for Aspergillus and other common fungal infections. Because of a persistent air leak, surgical intervention was needed. The histological finding was consistent with invasive mycosis, and cultures were positive for Scedosporium apiospermum. Literature review showed that, among patients with HIV/AIDS, Scedosporium can present from focal localized to systemic disease, is resistant to traditional antifungal agents, and may respond to prompt management with voriconazole."

7675,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug resistance results from the accumulation of mutations in the viral genes targeted by the drugs. These genetic changes, however, are commonly detected and monitored by techniques that only take into account the dominant population of plasma virus. Because HIV-1-infected patients harbor a complex and diverse mixture of virus populations, the mechanisms underlying the emergence and the evolution of resistance are not fully elucidated. Using techniques that allow the quantification of resistance mutations in minority virus species, we have monitored the evolution of resistance in plasma virus populations from patients failing protease inhibitor treatment. Minority populations with distinct resistance genotypes were detected in all patients throughout the evolution of resistance. The emergence of new dominant genotypes followed two possible mechanisms: (i) emergence of a new mutation in a currently dominant genotype and (ii) emergence of a new genotype derived from a minority virus species. In most cases, these population changes were associated with an increase in resistance at the expense of a reduction in replication capacity. Our findings provide a preliminary indication that minority viral species, which evolve independently of the majority virus population, can eventually become dominant populations, thereby serving as a reservoir of diversity and possibly accelerating the development of drug resistance."
6413,0.004,4.0,"A methodology based on micellar liquid chromatography to monitor five antiretroviral drugs (lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, zidovudine and efavirenz) was proposed. Antiretrovirals were studied in sets of three, corresponding to each highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regime, prescribed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-infected patients. Four aqueous micellar mobile phases buffered at pH 7 were optimized to separate these compounds, using sodium dodecyl sulfate as the tensioactive, and 1-propanol or 1-pentanol as the organic modifier. The composition of each mobile phase was optimized for each antiretroviral. The common separation conditions were: C18 apolar column (125 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size), UV detection set at 214 nm, and mobile phase running at 1 mL min(-1) without controlling the temperature. The finally suggested method was validated for five analysed antiretroviral drugs following the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines in terms of: linearity between 0.5 and 50 ppm (r(2) > 0.9995), sensitivity (LOD lower than 0.25 ppm), intra- and inter-day precision (<7.1 and <5.2%, respectively) and accuracy (recovery 88.5-105.3% and 93.5-101.3%, respectively), as well as robustness (<6.5%). The proposed method was used to monitor the level of antiretrovirals in the serum of AIDS patients. The suggested methodology was found to be useful in the routine analysis of antiretrovirals in serum samples."
9214,0.004,4.0,"The development of an effective maternal HIV-1 vaccine that could synergize with antiretroviral therapy (ART) to eliminate pediatric HIV-1 infection will require the characterization of maternal immune responses capable of blocking transmission of autologous HIV to the infant. We previously determined that maternal plasma antibody binding to linear epitopes within the variable loop 3 (V3) region of HIV envelope (Env) and neutralizing responses against easy-to-neutralize tier 1 viruses were associated with reduced risk of peripartum HIV infection in the historic U.S. Woman and Infant Transmission Study (WITS) cohort. Here, we defined the fine specificity and function of the potentially protective maternal V3-specific IgG antibodies associated with reduced peripartum HIV transmission risk in this cohort. The V3-specific IgG binding that predicted low risk of mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) was dependent on the C-terminal flank of the V3 crown and particularly on amino acid position 317, a residue that has also been associated with breakthrough transmission in the RV144 vaccine trial. Remarkably, the fine specificity of potentially protective maternal plasma V3-specific tier 1 virus-neutralizing responses was dependent on the same region in the V3 loop. Our findings suggest that MTCT risk is associated with neutralizing maternal IgG that targets amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of the V3 loop crown, suggesting the importance of the region in immunogen design for maternal vaccines to prevent MTCT."
9540,0.004,4.0,"Evidence of increasing prevalence of drug resistance among recent HIV seroconverters indicates a growing public health concern and warrants an examination of the problem from a prevention perspective. Among 638 HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) completing 2731 visits between December 1996 and February 2000 in an ongoing cohort study in Baltimore, Maryland, factors associated with unprotected sex and needle sharing were determined. Participants were classified as being at higher or lower risk of HIV and of drug-resistant HIV transmission based on viral load, antiretroviral therapy use, and reported high-risk behavior. Stored plasma of those at higher risk of drug-resistant HIV transmission was tested for resistance by VirtualPhenotype (Vircolab, Rockville, MD). Women were nearly twice as likely as men to engage in unprotected sex, and IDUs were more likely to have unprotected sex if their sexual partners were also HIV infected. IDUs were at higher risk of HIV and drug-resistant HIV transmission at 19% and 6% of all visits, respectively. Participants were infected with drug-resistant HIV at 14% of visits when they were at higher risk of HIV transmission. Intensive risk reduction counseling is needed and must be integrated into routine HIV clinical care."
3951,0.004,4.0,"To determine the current risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in multiply transfused thalassemia patients, we tested sera from such patients in New York City for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and its antibody (anti-HBs) using radioimmunoassay techniques. Altogether 48 per cent of the patients had either HBsAg (4.5%) or anti-HBs (43.9%) positive sera. The prevalence of these HBV markers was related to both the number of units transfused and the year blood transfusion therapy was begun, although evidence suggested that the latter factor had the greatest influence. Donor HBsAg screening began in New York in 1969, and only one patient first transfused since that time had HBV marker positive serum. Thus, multiply-transfused thalassemia patients now appear to be at little risk of HBV infection from transfusions. Sera were also tested for antibody to the hepatitis A virus (anti-HA) using immune adherence hemaglutination. Anti-HA prevalence was only 4.9 per cent, no greater than rates reported among nontransfused children, providing evidence against a significant role for blood transfusions in hepatitis A virus transmission."
816,0.004,4.0,"A retrospective cohort study was conducted and 129 patients with a diagnosis of HIV infection for more than 10 years were identified. Half the patients were men and mean (standard deviation, SD) age at HIV diagnosis was 33.2 (9.2) years. One third had a diagnosis of AIDS at cohort entry with median (interquartile range, IQR) CD4 counts of 259 (112-430) cells/mm(3). All received antiretroviral therapy with median (IQR) current CD4 counts of 502 (363-607) cells/mm(3) and 95% had HIV RNA <50 copies/mL. For adverse events, 28% experienced drug resistance, 27% experienced hospitalization, 59% had dyslipidemia, 35% had creatinine >1.0 mg/dL, and 5% had glucose >126 mg/dL. In conclusion, immunological and virological responses can be achieved among patients with a diagnosis of HIV infection for more than 10 years even in a resource-limited setting. Adverse events are common. Preparation for monitoring and management of these adverse events is a crucial part of successful long-term HIV care."

4949,0.004,4.0,"Since the introduction of antiviral compounds such as lamivudine and famciclovir in the treatment schedules of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the accumulation of a variety of mutations in the HBV polymerase gene has been observed. The selection of these mutations is generally considered the cause of viral nonresponsiveness and treatment failure. Therefore, the detection of these mutations is of clinical importance. Previously genotyped HBV strains isolated from treated and untreated patients were amplified with primers specific for the HBV polymerase region from amino acids 465 to 562. Amplified products were cloned into plasmid vectors. The clones were used as reference strains. A set of 38 highly specific oligonucleotide probes covering three different codon positions, L528M, M552V/I, and V/L/M555I, were selected. These probes were applied as 19 different lines on a membrane strip. The strips were then hybridized with PCR fragments from the reference panel, revealing the amino acids at the three codon positions simultaneously for each clone. PCR products generated from two patients infected with HBV genotypes A and C, respectively, and treated with nucleoside analogs were analyzed on these strips. A gradual increase in genetic HBV polymerase complexity was observed in follow-up samples compared to that in pretreatment samples. Additional analysis of HBV polymerase DNA fragments in recombinant plasmid clones demonstrated the existence of (i) clones with double mutations, (ii) clones with single mutations at either codon 528, 552, or 555, and (iii) the simultaneous occurrence of two or more viral populations within one sample. This line probe assay detected the complex quasispecies nature of HBV and provided some insight into the dynamics of resistance mutations."

6570,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation during immunosuppressive therapy is common in patients with solid tumor or hematological malignancies. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to hepatitis flare and/or hepatic decompensation. These consequences arising from HBV reactivation are, however, largely preventable. Routine screening for HBV serologic status is recommended for all cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or biologics. By recognizing different serological patterns (which represent either overt or occult HBV infection) and the types of immunosuppressive therapies prescribed, a risk-adapted approach can be established. Prophylactic therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues (prior to or concomitantly with the commencement of immunosuppressive therapies) is more effective than pre-emptive therapy (starting antiviral when HBV DNA level is rising) in high-risk individuals. Entecavir has been proven to be more effective than lamivudine according to recent studies. Close monitoring of serum HBV level is the preferred strategy in low-risk patients. However, the optimal interval of DNA monitoring and the duration of therapy remain unknown. "
8678,0.004,4.0,"The severe complications of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome represent the final phase of a prolonged course of immune system destruction during the infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Many of these complications can be predicted by measuring the depletion of CD4 positive lymphocytes. The CD4 positive lymphocyte counts are now widely accepted as a surrogate marker to assess the stage of disease and to determine immune response in major clinical trials. Other lymphocyte subsets are candidate surrogate markers for antiretroviral therapy. Our laboratory has utilized flow cytometry to perform lymphocyte subset testing, including CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8 ratio, and others for more than three years on persons with suspected immune deficiency. Results from our laboratory are presented to illustrate the use of these procedures in an urban, predominantly inner city population. The role of flow cytometry in monitoring patients with HIV infection is discussed."

We investigated the existence of opportunistic protozoans that significantly affect the quality of life in HIV-1 infected patients using conventional and molecular methods. The study group comprised 115 HIV-1 positive patients. In the identification of Cyclospora cayetanensis and Cryptosporidium, the formol-ether precipitation method was used and smears were evaluated in optical microscope by staining modified Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN). The primers and probes used for PCR were Heat shock protein 70 for C. cayetanensis and the oocysts wall protein for Cryptosporidium spp.. Cyclospora and Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were detected in one and two patients, respectively, by staining, whereas we detected C. cayetanensis in three patients out of 115 (2.6%) by PCR, and Cryptosporidium spp. in a further three patients (2.6%). C. cayetensis was detected in patients with CD4 counts of 64 cells/μm, 182 cells/μm and 287 cells/μm, respectively. Cryptosporidium spp. was detected in patients with CD4 counts of 176 cells/μm, 241 cells/μm and 669 cells/μm. As conclusion, PCR method is faster and more sensitive than microscopic methods and to screen intestinal pathogens routinely in patients infected with HIV should not be neglected in developing countries like Turkey."
1993,0.004,4.0,"We analyzed hepatitis B virus (HBV) genomes obtained from serum samples and liver biopsy specimen of a chronic HBsAg/anti-HBe carrier with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Before the liver biopsy, performed at the time of HCC diagnosis, the patient had been followed for 2 years; the serum samples collected in that period resulted negative for HBV-DNA dot blot hybridization. The hepatic DNA was at first examined by Southern blot, but no HBV sequence was detected. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification revealed the presence of HBV genomes in DNA extracted from the liver tissue and from two serum samples collected, respectively, 1 and 2 years before the biopsy. Direct sequence of the amplified preC/C and preS regions showed that the viral populations present in serum and liver were identical and that they had a 34 nucleotide deletion in the preS2 region, while the preC region presented two mutations each introducing a translational stop codon, one at the carboxy terminal end and the other at the second codon of the region, both able to prevent HBeAg expression. These results identify a new HBV variant which was selected during a chronic infection, and had very low levels of replication as shown by its detection only after PCR amplification."
4796,0.004,4.0,"Among health professionals, knowledge about the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is often limited, inaccurate, or both. Many health professionals also resist working with AIDS patients. This 1988 survey examined exaggerated risk estimates for HIV contagion in relationship to HIV-AIDS knowledge and resistance to working with AIDS patients among medical and nursing students at a large Northwestern teaching hospital. The results indicate that among the respondents, exaggerated risk estimates were associated both with a lack of HIV-AIDS knowledge and with greater resistance to working with AIDS patients. Results from multiple regression analyses revealed that (1) a lack of clinical experience with AIDS patients and (2) antihomosexual attitudes were significantly associated with the students' lack of HIV-AIDS knowledge, even after controlling for the effects of exaggerated risk estimates. The first two variables also were shown to be significantly predictive of the students' resistance to working with AIDS patients, as was an intolerance of drug use and drug users, beyond the influence of exaggerated risk estimates. Specific approaches of developing effective HIV-AIDS educational programs for health professionals are proposed."

To evaluate factors associated with an undetectable VL near delivery in HIV-infected pregnant women receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and non-HAART regimens, HIV-infected pregnant women with a detectable VL at entry and having used antiretrovirals for ≥4 weeks before delivery were selected. Multivariate analysis was employed using binary logistic unconditional models; the dependent variable was having a VL <400 copies/mL near delivery. VL suppression was achieved in 403/707 women (57%): 65.4% in the HAART group, but only 26% in the non-HAART group P = 0.001. Duration of HAART was correlated with VL suppression, with maximum benefit seen after ≥12 weeks of therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.72-3.65). CD4+ cell count near delivery (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.06-2.20) and baseline VL (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.58-0.94) were also independently associated with VL suppression. Overall MTCT rate was 1.6%.

6558,0.004,4.0,"The identification of various risk factors of vertical human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission resulted in the development of strategies whose aim was to decrease the mother's viral load, to reduce her child's exposure to it during delivery, and to avoid the subsequent viral exposure due to breastfeeding. The administration of antiretroviral treatment during pregnancy, delivery and to the neonate (PACTG 076) proved to be useful. At a first stage, zidovudine was used. A triple combination therapy was then administered. Initially, the viral transmission in mothers who were enrolled in protocols for vertically transmitted HIV prophylaxis was reduced to 9.5%, whereas the last measurement carried out between 1998 and 2005, the initial figure was brought down to 2%. Nevertheless, the delivery of infected children whose mother's HIV status was unknown is still considered likely to happen. The main step to be taken to reduce HIV infection among children is to perform universal HIV tests during pregnancy, so that HIV positive pregnant patients conveniently receive proper prophylaxis. We look forward to achieving this by following the new prevention guidelines of vertically-transmitted HIV infection, developed by the Comisión Nacional del SIDA of the Chilean Health Ministry."

Audit proformas were sent to clinics reporting prisoners to the genitourinary medicine clinic activity dataset in 2011. Thirty-two clinics responded. Data for 151 HIV-positive prisoners were reported by 12 clinics, with the other clinics not reporting any prisoners. Outcomes were compared to a previous audit, British HIV Association (BHIVA) and the National AIDS Trust guidelines. Initial CD4 counts were available for 101 patients, of which 42/101 had CD4 <350 cells/mm(3). At reception, viral load data were available for 95 patients, of which 74 were on antiretroviral therapy. Of these, 50/74 (68%) had VL <40 copies/ml. Fifty-one per cent of those on highly active antiretroviral therapy were seen in a specialist clinic less than four weeks after reception. Urgency of referral to a specialist HIV clinic was not related to CD4 or viral load. Twenty-two per cent had hepatitis C co-infection.

4026,0.004,4.0,"Objectives The longer survival of patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and the introduction of the highly active antiretroviral therapy have increased the number of chronic conditions; among these, cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study is to determine patient, disease, and factors associated with peripheral arterial disease in a population of patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Methods A prospective nested case-control study of a cohort of patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was conducted in a tertiary medical center in Mexico City. A sample size of 206 patients was calculated. Medical history, relevant laboratory data, peripheral arterial exam, and screening ankle-brachial index tests were obtained. Results The prevalence of abnormal ankle-brachial indexes was 20% (42 patients). Patient's mean age was 44 years ±13. The majority (98.5%) were actively receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy; active smoking was reported in 55 (27%), arterial hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus were found in 24 (12%) and 22 (11%) patients. Median time from the human immunodeficiency virus diagnosis was eight years (Interquartile range ±11); the mean CD4 count was 481, with a mean viral load of 13,557 copies (SD ± 69025.27) and 1889.18 (SD ± 9052.77) for patients with normal and abnormal ankle-brachial index and a median of 40 (IQ ± 2). Viral load ( p = 0.04) and number of years with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( p = 0.04) were significantly associated with abnormal ankle-brachial indexes. Conclusions Abnormal ankle-brachial index seems to be more frequent in Mexican patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when compared with the general population at the same age. The most important factors associated with arterial disease were the viral load and the number of years with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."

This study was conducted to determine the response rate of HBV antibody after re-vaccination in HIV-infected children with immune recovery on HAART. Sixty-three successfully HAART-treated HIV-infected children with history of prior HBV vaccination received 10microg doses of recombinant HBV vaccine (Government Pharmaceutical Organization-Merieux Biological Product, Bangkok, Thailand) intramuscularly at 0, 2 and 6 months. The vaccine response rates were 17.4, 82.5, and 92.1% at 2, 6 and 7 months after the first dose of vaccine, respectively. Plasma HIV RNA level below the limit of detection at the time of re-vaccination was associated with successful vaccine response.

7294,0.004,4.0,"In 1989 the prevalence of hepatitis B virus markers was studied by radioimmunoassay in a sample of 1,426 healthy children, 3 to 11 years old, attending kindergarten and the primary schools in a large urban area of the Apulia Region in Southern Italy, where the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence among pregnant women is 5.6%. The overall prevalence of any hepatitis B virus marker was 3.4%, increasing from 1.7% in 3- to 5-year-old children to 5% in 10- to 11-year-old children (P less than 0.002). Prevalence was not associated with the father's years of schooling (odds ratio, 1.98; confidence interval, 95% (0.9 to 4.6] or with the family size (odds ratio, 2.96; confidence interval, (0.7 to 11.8]. The overall HBsAg prevalence was 0.8, a rate that was lower than the 5.6% found in pregnant women. The finding of only 12 HBsAg-positive children of the 1,426 tested, despite 80 of them being born to HBsAg-positive carrier mothers (on the basis of the 5.6% HBsAg prevalence among pregnant women), is probably attributable to the low proportion (5%) of hepatitis B e antigen positivity among the HBsAg-positive carrier mothers in the study area. The observed low HBV infection rate in younger age groups, which confirms recent studies in other areas of Italy, appears to be the result of several factors: improved socioeconomic conditions; decreased family size; and increased use of disposable syringes in the last few years."

This study aims to assess the prevalence of occult HBV infection (OBI) including the identification of HBV-genotypes in a population of immigrants serologically negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Between May 2006 and May 2010, 339 immigrants were tested for markers of HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. HBV-DNA was tested by using nested-PCR assays on three different genetic region. HBV-DNA was detected in plasma samples of 11/339 (3.2 %) patients. Most of them had no serological markers of HBV infection, 3/58 (5.2 %) were anti-HBc-alone, and 4/13 (30.8 %) were anti-HIV positive. HIV positivity was the only factor independently associated with the higher probability of observing OBI (OR = 16.5, p < 0.001). No HCV co-infected patients were found. Genotype D was detected in 9/11 (81.8 %) OBI cases, while the remaining two (18.2 %) were classified as genotype E. Although OBI was found at lower rate than expected among immigrants from highly endemic countries, anti-HBc alone positivity was confirmed as a sentinel marker of occult HBV infection. Nevertheless, a marked heterogeneity of HBV markers was found among HBV-DNA positive subjects. Our finding evidenced the predominance of HBV-genotype D viral strains among OBI cases, also in those from geographical areas where overt HBV infections are mainly sustained by viral genotypes other than D.

The combination of ADV or TDF with other nucleoside analogs is a proposed strategy for managing antiviral drug resistance during the treatment of chronic HBV infection. The antiviral effect of oral ADV or TDF, alone or in combination with 3TC or emtricitabine (FTC), against chronic woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection was evaluated in a placebo-controlled study in the woodchuck, an established and predictive model for antiviral therapy. Once-daily treatment for 48 weeks with ADV plus 3TC or TDF plus FTC significantly reduced serum WHV viremia levels from the pretreatment level by 6.2 log(10) and 6.1 log(10) genome equivalents/ml serum, respectively, followed by TDF plus 3TC (5.6 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), ADV alone (4.8 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), ADV plus FTC (one survivor) (4.4 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), TDF alone (2.9 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), 3TC alone (2.7 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), and FTC alone (2.0 log(10) genome equivalents/ml). Individual woodchucks across all treatment groups also demonstrated pronounced declines in serum WHV surface antigen, characteristically accompanied by declines in hepatic WHV replication and the hepatic expression of WHV antigens. Most woodchucks had prompt recrudescence of WHV replication after drug withdrawal, but individual woodchucks across treatment groups had sustained effects. No signs of toxicity were observed for any of the drugs or drug combinations administered. In conclusion, the oral administration of 3TC, FTC, ADV, and TDF alone and in combination was safe and effective in the woodchuck model of HBV infection."
5080,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and treatment updates include screening recommendations, fourth-generation testing, preexposure prophylaxis, and a paradigm shift; treatment is prevention. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends routine HIV screening in persons 15 to 65 years of age, regardless of risk. Fourth-generation testing is replacing the Western blot and can identify those with acute HIV infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test; however, there are concerns about reduced sensitivity, possible misinterpretation of results, potential for less effective counseling, and possible cost barriers. Preexposure prophylaxis (effective in select high-risk adult populations) is the combination of safer sex practices and continuous primary care prevention services, plus combination antiretroviral therapy. Concerns for preexposure prophylaxis include the necessity of strict medication adherence, limited use among high-risk populations, and community misconceptions of appropriate use. Evidence supports combination antiretroviral therapy as prevention for acute HIV infection, thus lowering community viral loads. Evidence has increased supporting combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment at any CD4 cell count. Resistance testing should guide therapy in all patients on entry into care. Within two weeks of diagnosis of most opportunistic infections, combination antiretroviral therapy should be started; patients with tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis require special considerations."

In combination with other proven HIV-prevention methods, preexposure prophylaxis may be a useful tool for women at the highest risk of HIV acquisition. Obstetrician-gynecologists involved in the care of women using preexposure prophylaxis must reinforce adherence to daily medication. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance for preexposure prophylaxis is likely to evolve in the coming years, and obstetrician-gynecologists should remain aware of new developments in this area. Risk reduction for all women at risk of HIV infection should include counseling about testing, safe-sex practices (including condom use), and other behavioral interventions."
6480,0.004,4.0,"It is estimated that there are millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within human genome and there are likely to explain much of the genetic diversity of individuals. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is etiologically associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 80% of cases, and is the dominant cause of death among HBV carriers. Among patients with chronic HBV infection, family history is a known risk factor for the development of HCC; therefore, genetic factors are likely to modify the risk of HCC. However, the genetic factors that determine progression to HCC remain mostly to be investigated. In this review, we discussed that the natural history of HBV infection and host genetic factors related to HCC, study design and target gene selection for the detection of SNPs related to the occurrence of HCC. Also, we reviewed that several SNPs or haplotypes, which were reportedly associated with increased or reduced risk of HCC occurrence in patients with chronic HBV infection. Screening of these polymorphisms might be useful in clinical practice to stratify the lower or higher risk group for HCC and might modify the design of HCC surveillance programs in patients with chronic HBV infection, if further genetic susceptibilities are identified."
1220,0.004,4.0,"Occult hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a new entity that should be considered when diagnosing patients with abnormal liver functions of unknown origin. This work was carried out to evaluate T-helper 1/T-helper 2 (Th1/Th2) cytokine profiles in patients with occult HCV infection versus chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection, also to investigate any association between theses cytokines and liver histological features in both groups. Serum levels of Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IFN-gamma) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) were measured in 35 patients with occult HCV infection compared to 50 patients with chronic hepatitis C infection and 30 healthy controls. We have found that Th1 cytokines were significantly increased in patients with CHC infection than in both occult HCV infection and control groups (p less than 0.001). On the other hand, serum IL-4 levels were higher in occult HCV infection than in CHC and control groups (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, serum IL-10 levels were higher in both patient groups vs control group (pless than 0.001), with no significant difference between CHC and occult HCV groups. Finally, only serum IL-10 levels were significantly higher among patients with high activity (A2-A3) than those with low activity (A0-A1) in both CHC and occult HCV groups (p=0.038, p=0.025, respectively). Patients with occult HCV infection exhibited a distinct immunoregulatory cytokine pattern that is shifted towards the Th2 arm. "

Two different HBV genotypes were identified in this patient. A search of the medical literature indicated this report is the first to describe a multiple silent HBV infection in an HIV/HCV-coinfected-patient. The elevated incidence of the anti-HBc alone pattern in HIV-positive patients and the increasing number of silent HBV infections detected in those patients demonstrate the need to carefully examine HIV-positive patients for occult HBV infection. In addition, it appears necessary to thoroughly study such patients in order to evaluate the impact of mixed HBV infection and triple HIV/HCV/HBV infection on morbidity."
7297,0.004,4.0,"A 39-year-old man with newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was admitted with right-sided weakness, right-sided vision loss and slurred speech, which worsened over several weeks. Brain imaging revealed bilateral intraparenchymal ring-enhancing lesions and enhancement of the right optic nerve. Serological findings were positive for venereal disease research laboratory test, whereas the cerebrospinal fluid venereal disease research laboratory test was nonreactive. Brain biopsy suggested a diagnosis of syphilitic cerebral gummata, and the patient's improvement with penicillin and dexamethasone further supported this etiology. Syphilitic cerebral gummata have rarely been reported in patients with HIV infection. This patient demonstrates that cerebral gummata should be considered in the differential diagnosis in immunocompromised patients with characteristic brain masses, that HIV and syphilis often coexist with early neurosyphilis appearing more frequently in this patient population and that normal cerebrospinal fluid studies may not represent a true lack of syphilitic activity in HIV patients."
5077,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global problem and the world has 350 million carriers of chronic hepatitis B. Over 50 % of these have acquired their infection vertically from their mothers (mother-to-child transmission [MTCT]). Majority (>90 %) of vertically-acquired infection results into chronic infection, due to induction of an immune-tolerant state. Hence, management of chronic HBV during pregnancy and strategies to prevent MTCT would go a long way in global control of HBV infection and the morbidity and mortality associated with it. However, chronic HBV infection in pregnancy presents a unique challenge, because of existence of a complex relationship between the physiological changes of pregnancy and the pathophysiological response of body to HBV. This relationship may lead to a varied presentation of the patient to the doctor depending on the period of her pregnancy and stage of her liver disease. Each of these modes of presentation raises issues that need to be addressed for successful maternal and fetal outcome, including prevention of MTCT of HBV. This review will try to give a practical approach in addressing these issues."
9328,0.004,4.0,"Chronic infection by Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) causes liver fibrosis, which is accelerated by unknown mechanisms in patients with HIV-1 coinfection. The evolution of HCV quasispecies in this setting of coinfection is not fully understood. To compare HCV quasispecies between HIV-HCV coinfection and HCV monoinfection, we sequenced 340 HCV clones from the HVR-1 and NS3 regions at two different time points in two groups of treatment-naïve patients with HCV-1a infection: (1) HIV-HCV positive (n=6); and (2) HIV negative-HCV positive (n=3). In HCV/HIV coinfection, we found a trend for reduced HCV genetic complexity and diversity, and a trend towards reduced dN/dS ratios in the HVR-1 region, especially in those patients with CD4<200cells/mm(3), who lost positive selective immune pressure in the HVR-1 region. Differences in immune regulation of HCV quasispecies in HIV coinfected individuals deserve further exploration to clarify the different outcomes of chronic hepatitis C noted between the immunocompromised and the immunocompetent host."

Both the first and second isolates from each patient had the same IS (insertion sequence) 6110-based DNA fingerprint patterns. Three of the five patients developed TB that was resistant to rifampin alone; no mutation in the region of the rpoB gene was detected by a line probe assay in two of the isolates from these patients. We discuss several factors presumably associated with acquired drug resistance in HIV-infected patients, including exogenous reinfection, drug interactions, malabsorption of drugs, and the presence of a large organism burden."
2019,0.004,4.0,"The main goal of the present paper was to analyze the molecular diversity of the principal neutralizing domain (V3 loop) of the HIV 1 gp120 in samples from patients of Argentina. The study was carried out on a total of 30 HIV 1 positive blood samples, obtained during 1991-1992, belonging to 15 intravenous drug users (group A), 5 homosexual men (group B), 8 children born to HIV 1 positive mothers (group C) and 2 AIDS patients (group D). By using extracted DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes and from infected cells of the viral isolates in the case of the 2 AIDS patients, the V3 loop region was amplified by means of polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequencing by Sanger methodology was then performed on DNA fragments and nucleotide sequences obtained were translated into the correspondent amino acids. Consensus sequences for each group and a general consensus sequence were established (Table 1). Its alignment with V3 loop amino acid sequences of the major HIV 1 strains isolated worldwide is showed in table 2. Homology analysis between each sequence of the study population and sequence of different HIV 1 isolates showed that most of these samples share high homology with SF2 and BH10 strains. In contrast a low homology was found with JH3 and MN isolated (table 3). The presence of highly conserved amino acid residues as substitutions and insertions was determined in the Argentinian V3 loop sequences giving them a local pattern. The present paper is of great importance for our country, considering that the V3 loop is the main neutralizing domain becoming a major target in the development of HIV 1 vaccine. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the sequencing of the principal neutralizing domain of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 in Latin America."
4018,0.004,4.0,"Although HAART has resulted in improved health outcomes for most HIV-infected individuals, liver failure has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). In HBV mono-infected individuals, core deletion mutants are associated with more aggressive liver disease. As HIV accelerates HBV liver disease progression, we hypothesized that HIV-HBV co-infected individuals have increased frequency of core mutations including deletions. To test this hypothesis, we have analysed genome-length sequences of HBV DNA from patients both prior to and during antiviral therapy."
6463,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral therapies potentially suppress HBV viral load to an undetectable level reducing the risk of progressive liver disease and the development of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Adherence to antiviral therapies is imperative to achieve and maintain viral suppression. To date, there has been limited research on adherence to HBV therapies. Our study aimed to explore factors influencing adherence to antiviral therapy. A total of 29 participants consented to in-depth qualitative interviews at three outpatient clinics in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were initially classified as adherent or nonadherent and thematic analysis was used to identify dominant themes. Adherent behavior was reported by 59% (n = 17) of participants. Several themes influenced adherence including routine, fear of HBV-related disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, and forgetfulness. To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study to explore adherence to HBV antiviral therapy. An interplay of several dominant themes emerged from our data including fear of chronic HBV disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, routine, and forgetfulness. Study findings have the potential to change nursing clinical practice, especially the way nurses and other clinicians target key HBV treatment messages and education, while monitoring adherence."
5597,0.004,4.0,"Little is known of the peptide ligands expressed in vivo on antigen-presenting cells (APC) or of the APC lineages involved. In this study we have addressed this question using HLA-DRbeta1*0101-restricted CD4 T cell clones (TLC) specific for a synthetic peptide based on the HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop consensus sequence for the Clade B isolates predominantly found in European and North American patients. These TLC were found to respond, in a dose-dependent manner, to freshly isolated HIV-infected patient APC in the absence of exogenously added peptides. Further APC purification showed that the naturally expressed peptide ligands were present in both the APC lineages shown to be infected with the virus and were most strongly detectable on purified blood dendritic cells. Peptides based on consensus sequences of viruses isolated from one of the patients over the period when naturally expressed peptide ligands could be detected were all found to stimulate TLC proliferation. These studies, therefore, show that peptide ligands derived from natural infection are detectable on APC lineages, particularly on dendritic cells which play an important role in the immune response to viruses. Even small differences in sequence between the vaccine isolate and the natural infection, if they occur in the key residues of protective T cell epitopes, could therefore have a profound effect on the efficacy of vaccines against viruses with high rates of mutation."

M. kansasii infections in HIV-positive patients are classified as either pulmonary or disseminated.

6669,0.004,4.0,"Potent antiretroviral treatment is associated with dramatic improvements in immune function in many human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. This has led to new US Public Health Service/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines that suggest that in certain circumstances (primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection, and secondary prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus retinitis), antimicrobial prophylaxis can be discontinued for patients whose CD4 T-cell counts rise above threshold levels for at least 3-6 months. The new guidelines are probably too conservative, and effective antiretroviral treatment almost certainly provides protection against all major opportunistic pathogens. Therefore, in the future, specific prophylaxis will be needed only for those patients who do not benefit from or fail to adhere to the current more effective treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection."
8705,0.004,4.0,"A group of conserved hydrophobic residues faces the interior of the coiled-coil-like structure within the N-terminal domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid protein (CA). It has been suggested that these residues are important for maintaining stable structure and functional activity. To investigate this possibility, we constructed two HIV-1 clones, in which Trp23 or Phe40 was changed to Ala. We also constructed a third mutant, D51A, which has a mutation that destroys a salt bridge between Pro1 and Asp51. All three mutants are replication defective but produce virus particles. Mutant virions contain all of the viral proteins, although the amount and stability of CA are decreased and levels of virion-associated integrase are reduced. The mutations do not affect endogenous reverse transcriptase activity; however, the mutants are blocked in their ability to initiate reverse transcription in infected cells and no minus-strand strong-stop DNA is detected. The defect in reverse transcription is associated with striking defects in the morphology of mutant virus cores, as determined by transmission electron microscopy. Our data indicate that the mutations made in this study disrupt CA structure and prevent proper maturation of virus cores. We propose that this results in a defect in core stability or in an early postentry event preceding reverse transcription."
7059,0.004,4.0,"The majority of the HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) testing studies have focused on subtype B virus. The predominance of subtype C in the Indian subcontinent along with greater access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) necessitates studies on HIVDR genotyping. We determined the prevalence of mutations associated with protease inhibitors (PI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) from plasma of 40 antiretroviral drug-naive study participants in Indian HIV-1 pol gene sequences. Of these, 36 sequences belonged to subtype C, two to subtype A1, and two were subtype A1C recombinants. The heterosexual route was the most common route of transmission. Drug resistance-associated mutations were observed in 10% (4/40) of the study participants. The resistance mutation observed in the protease gene was V82A, whereas in the RT gene, M41L, D67N, M184V, and A98G were documented. This is the first study reporting major protease mutations by genotyping in ART-naive individuals from western India."
6725,0.004,4.0,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27-positive subjects are uncommon in their ability to control infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, late viral escape from a narrowly directed immunodominant Gag-specific CD8(+) T-lymphocyte (CTL) response has been linked to AIDS progression in these individuals. Identifying the mechanism of the immune-mediated control may provide critical insights into HIV-1 vaccine development. Here, we illustrate that the CTL escape mutation R(264)K in the HLA-B27-restricted KK10 epitope in the capsid resulted in a significant defect in viral replication in vitro. The R(264)K variant was impaired in generating late reverse transcription products, indicating that replication was blocked at a postentry step. Notably, the R(264)K mutation was associated in vivo with the development of a rare secondary mutation, S(173)A, which restored viral replication in vitro. Furthermore, infectivity of the R(264)K variant was rescued by the addition of cyclosporine A or infection of a cyclophilin A-deficient cell line. These data demonstrate a severe functional defect imposed by the R(264)K mutation during an early step in viral replication that is likely due to the inability of this variant to replicate efficiently in the presence of normal levels of cyclophilin A. We conclude that the impact of the R(264)K substitution on capsid structure constrains viral escape and enables long-term maintenance of the dominant CTL response against B27-KK10, providing an explanation for the protective effect of HLA-B27 during HIV infection."
4972,0.004,4.0,"The surveillance of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) through case reporting only reflects the epidemiologic features of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) transmission a few years earlier and not the prevalence of HIV seropositivity. HIV infection is not a notifiable condition in Quebec. We were asked by the ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux du Québec to perform a pilot project for the surveillance of HIV seropositivity using a network of sentinel physicians. From May 15, 1988, to Sept. 30, 1989, physicians from four collaborating centres collected data on the serologic status, demographic characteristics and risk factors for 4209 patients who underwent HIV antibody testing. Of the 3899 subjects included in the study 7.9% were HIV positive. Through logistic regression analysis the following variables were found to be significantly associated with HIV seropositivity: presence of HIV-related symptoms (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 36.5), origin from an endemic area (POR 9.1), homosexuality or bisexuality (POR 8.4), intravenous drug use (POR 4.2), male sex (POR 2.8), previous HIV antibody testing (POR 2.5) and previous sexually transmitted disease (POR 1.8). Over the study period we found a large increase in HIV seroprevalence among intravenous drug users (4.2% in 1988 to 19.0% in 1989) (p = 0.02). This increase might reflect a recent change in the epidemiologic pattern of HIV transmission in Quebec. Surveillance of HIV seropositivity through a network of sentinel physicians may be a reasonable alternative to mandatory reporting."
1546,0.004,4.0,"Genomic rearrangements in the 5' part of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) have been involved in multidrug resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTI). We carried out a retrospective, multicenter study to investigate the prevalence, variability, and phenotypic consequences of such rearrangements. Data concerning the HIV-1 RT genotype and the biological and clinical characteristics of NRTI-treated patients were collected from 10 virology laboratories. Sensitivities of the different HIV-1 variants to RT inhibitors were analyzed in a single-cycle recombinant virus assay. Fifty-two of 2,152 (2.4%) RT sequences had a rearrangement in the 5' part of the RT, with an extensive molecular variation. The number of codons inserted between positions 68 and 69 ranged from 1 (3 samples) or 2 (41 samples) to 5 and 11 in one case each. In four cases, codon 67 was deleted. High levels of phenotypic resistance to zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T), abacavir (ABC), and didanosine (ddI) were found in 95, 92, 72, 62, and 15% of the 40 samples analyzed, respectively. Resistance to AZT, d4T, and ABC could be found in the absence of the T215Y/F mutations. Resistance to 3TC could develop in the absence of specific mutations. Low-level resistance to ddI was noticed in 40% of the patients. The deletions of codon 67 seemed to have little effect on NRTI sensitivity. Most of the rearrangements were shown to contribute to cross-resistance to NRTI. The results regarding susceptibility to ddI raise the question of the interpretation of the phenotypic data concerning this drug."
9298,0.004,4.0,"Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common because of their shared modes of transmission. HIV infection alters the natural history of HBV infection, leading to more severe liver disease, decreased hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion, and higher HBV DNA levels. Furthermore, end-stage liver disease has emerged as a common cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected persons receiving HAART. For these reasons, it is important to vaccinate susceptible persons against HBV infection and to diagnose and treat chronic hepatitis B in HIV-infected persons. The treatment plan for chronic hepatitis B needs to be individualized based on the stage of both viral infections and the available options. It is anticipated that we are entering a period of combination therapy for chronic hepatitis B, but the ideal combination needs to be elucidated."
2819,0.004,4.0,"In many resource-limited regions with endemic hepatitis B virus (HBV), there is limited infrastructure to collect, process, transport, and store blood samples for identification of persons with chronic HBV infection or with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We describe the application of a simple technique using commercially available kits for detection of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) in dried blood spots (DBS) collected on filter paper. Study participants included subjects with and without chronic HBV infection and subjects with HCC or cirrhosis. Three to five blood drops were dried on filter paper. Dried blood (equivalent to 20 muL) was eluted and tested for HBsAg by Determine(TM) HBsAg and for AFP by counter-current immuno-electrophoresis and radio-immunoassay (RIA). The primary analysis focused on comparison of DBS results to serum testing results as the gold standard. The sensitivity of DBS for detecting chronic HBV infection was 96% (98-98) with specificity of 100% (CI 99-100). Sensitivity of DBS in detecting AFP compared with serum RIA was 73% (60-86) with specificity of 90% (81-98). Both HBsAg and AFP recovery were unaffected when DBS were left at room temperature (30-33 degrees C) and under humid conditions for up to 28 days prior to elution. We conclude that DBS can be reliably used as an economical and logical alternative for detection of HBsAg in chronically infected patients and for AFP-based diagnosis of HCC in clinical situations which preclude adequate collection and processing of blood samples. Both research-oriented field studies and routine clinical care may benefit from application of these techniques in resource-limited settings."

The sample consisted of 272 IDUs enrolled in the AjUDE-Brasil I Project, a cross-sectional multi-center study conducted in five Brazilian cities in 1998. Data were collected with a structured questionnaire using self-reported risk behavior, and HCV and HIV serological status used ELISA on filter paper. IDUs were clustered in four distinct groups: HCV/HIV seronegative; HCV mono-infected; HIV mono-infected; and HCV/HIV co-infected. Active sharing of injecting equipment was associated with HCV infection (p = 0.001). Sexual behavior variables, especially male same-sex sexual relations, were consistently associated with HIV infection. HCV/HIV co-infection was associated with both sexual and drug use variables. It was possible to distinguish different behavioral indicators for HCV and HIV infection and co-infection in this population."

We studied the lung disease features associated with AIDS in children and adolescents, in an era of ineffective antiretroviral therapy, between January 1996 and October 1998. This prospective, descriptive, longitudinal and historical medical chart review included 48 vertically HIV infected patients, receiving mono or double antiretroviral therapy, who had developed pulmonary disease. Those who presented acute pneumonia were classified into group 1; radiological changes for >or=3 months into group 2; those from group 1 and 2 who underwent lung biopsy into group 3. A rapidly progressive clinical course was found in 70.7% of the children and 37.5% younger than 6 months old. Bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed in all patients. High resolution chest computer tomographic scans (HRCT) from 27 patients showed a reticulonodular pattern in 8, ground-glass in 3, reticular in 3, nodular in 3, airspace consolidation in 3, mediastinal adenopathy in 3, pulmonary air cystic in 2 and air-trapping in 1. In five patients the HRCT were normal. Histopathology revealed: lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis in 5 patients, pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia in 9, tuberculosis in 1, interstitial pneumonia in 1, diffuse alveolar damage in 1. Two patients had Cryptococcus neoformans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We conclude that lung diseases were the major risk factor for high morbidity, and an invasive diagnostic procedure may clarify the main cause for similar radiologic images of infectious and non-infectious processes."

We investigated the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and solid-organ transplantation on skin cancer risk. We conducted a population-based case-control study among elderly U.S. adults (non-Hispanic whites, age 67 years or older), using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Medicare linked data. The study comprised 29,926 skin cancer cases (excluding basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas) and 119,704 controls, frequency-matched by gender, age and calendar year (1987-2002). Medicare claims identified solid-organ transplantation or HIV infection before cancer diagnosis/control selection. As negative controls, we evaluated other medical conditions (e.g., hypertension and depression) and cancers (breast, colon and prostate) not linked to immunosuppression. Odds ratios (ORs) compared prevalence in cases and controls, adjusted for matching factors and number of prior physician claims. Risks of Kaposi sarcoma (N = 602) and cutaneous non-Hodgkin lymphoma (N = 1,836) were increased with solid-organ transplantation (OR [95%CI]: 11.06 [5.27-23.23] and 2.27 [1.00-5.15], respectively) and HIV infection (21.58 [11.94-38.99] and 2.41 [1.05-5.52], respectively). Solid-organ transplantation was also associated with increased risks of Merkel cell carcinoma (N = 1,286; OR [95%CI] 4.95 [2.62-9.34]) and other cutaneous sarcomas (N = 972; 4.19 [1.83-9.56]). Solid-organ transplantation was nonsignificantly associated with melanoma (N = 23,974; (OR 1.36 [95%CI 0.98-1.88]). Null or weak associations were observed for negative control medical conditions and cancers. Solid-organ transplantation and HIV infection were followed by increased risk for some skin cancer subtypes among elderly adults. These results highlight the potential role of immunity in development of skin cancers."
8315,0.004,4.0,Prior research has demonstrated that emergency department (ED) patient acceptance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening is partially dependent on patients' self-perceived risk of infection.

8887,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is established by virus variants that use the CCR5 co-receptor for entry (CCR5-tropic or R5 variants), whereas viruses that use CXCR4 as co-receptor (CXCR4-tropic or X4 variants) emerge during disease progression in approximately 50 % of infected subjects. X4 variants may have a higher fitness ex vivo and their detection is usually accompanied by faster T-cell depletion and the onset of AIDS in HIV-1-positive individuals. Here, the relationship between the sequence variation of the HIV-1 env V3-V5 region and positive selective pressure on R5 and X4 variants from infected subjects with CD4 T cell counts below 200 cells microl(-1) was studied. A correlation was found between genetic distance and CD4(+) cell count at late stages of the disease. R5 variants that co-existed with X4 variants were significantly less heterogeneous than R5 variants from subjects without X4 variants (P < 0.0001). Similarly, X4 variants had a significantly higher diversity than R5 variants (P < 0.0001), although residues under positive selection had a similar distribution pattern in both variants. Therefore, both X4 and R5 variants were subjected to high selective pressures from the host. Furthermore, the interaction between X4 and R5 variants within the same subject resulted in a purifying selection on R5 variants, which only survived as a homogeneous virus population. These results indicate that R5 variants from X4 phenotype samples were highly homogeneous and under weakly positive selective pressures. In contrast, R5 variants from R5 phenotype samples were highly heterogeneous and subject to positive selective pressures."
2970,0.004,4.0,"We have constructed a series of retroviral vectors in which the expression of antisense RNA targeted at the full length coding sequence of HIV-1 tat or rev was driven by three different promoters and in the context of double-copy or single-copy vectors. Jurkat cells transduced by these vectors were shown to express the expected tat or rev antisense RNA without alteration in cell proliferation or surface CD4 expression. After challenge with HIV, four patterns of protection were identified, with the degree of protection being determined primarily by the design of the expression system. In those patterns showing long-term complete protection, we could detect no HIV p24 in the culture supernatants or in the cells, and no HIV RNA or HIV proviral DNA (by PCR), during a 23-week follow-up. Experiments designed to rescue any live virus still formed in the culture after 20 weeks' challenge demonstrated that, with some constructs, infectious virus could no longer be isolated, while with other constructs, only a low level of infectious virus was still being formed and providing a continuing virus challenge, although all other markers of infection remained undetectable. Our results demonstrated that antisense RNA expression driven by tRNA promoter in the context of a double-copy vector conferred better long-term protection against HIV infection compared to that driven by HIV LTR or MLV LTR promoters, and that the optimized vectors may be useful in developing a gene therapy against HIV-1 infection and AIDS."
1067,0.004,4.0,The role of placenta in vertical transmission is not yet fully understood. A protective role of the placenta during gestation is suggested by the finding that caesarian sections reduce the risk of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 from mother to child three- to fourfold. Here we investigated whether the immunological milieu of the placenta might be important in HIV-1 transmission. In situ imaging of immunohistochemically stained placenta sections and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a fourfold increase in CCR5:CXCR4 expression ratio in placentae from transmitting women compared to placentae from nontransmitting women. This chemokine receptor repertoire was consistent with an up-regulation of interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 expression in placentae from nontransmitting placentae compared to transmitting placentae. In situ imaging demonstrated that CCR5 and CXCR4 were expressed on placental macrophages and lymphocytes but not in trophoblasts. Simultaneous immunofluorescence/ultrasensitive in situ hybridization for HIV-1 gag-pol mRNA revealed that HIV-1 infects primarily CXCR4-expressing cells in placentae from nontransmitting women whereas predominantly CCR5-expressing cells were infected in placentae from transmitting women. These data are consistent with transmission of a homogeneous population of nonsyncytium-inducing HIV-1 isolates that use CCR5 as co-receptor.
1545,0.004,4.0,"A combination of antiviral therapies that target different sites in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replicative cycle may be necessary for optimal treatment of HIV-1 infections. We evaluated the interactions of a soluble virus receptor (recombinant soluble CD4 or rsT4) and a reverse transcriptase inhibitor (azidothymidine, AZT) against HIV-1 replication in vitro. A variety of cell types was studied including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a CD4-positive T-cell line, and a CD4-positive human monocyte cell line. The combination of rsT4 and AZT inhibited HIV-1 synergistically over a broad range of drug concentrations and multiplicities of infection in several different HIV-1 replication assays. Drug interactions were evaluated by the median-effect principle and the isobologram technique using a computer analysis. In all of the cell types tested, combinations of rsT4 and AZT were synergistic in vitro, without additive cytotoxicity."
6283,0.004,4.0,The recombinant envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1) of Chinese Yunan epidemic strain was expressed in E. coli for confirming the antigenic domains of the protein. The recombinant prokaryotic expressive plasmid pYNenv was constructed by inserting the env DNA fragment which encode the gp120 of HIV-1 Yunnan strain into pBV220. The env DNA fragment was obtained by nested polymerase chain reaction with the HIV-1 infected patients peripheral blood macrophage and monocyte genomes from Yunan HIV-1 epidemic area as template. The recombinant plasmid pYNenv was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. The recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli DH10b by pYNenv after vibration culture at 30 degrees C for 20 hours then at 42 degrees C for 5 hours and confirmed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The protein can specifically react with the serum of HIV-1 infected patient from Yunan epidemic area by Western blot assay. The result showed that the recombinant protein can be used as antigen for detection of HIV-1 membrane glycoprotein antibody as well as for the further study of the role of envelope protein in pathology.
3295,0.004,4.0,"A significant proportion of those initiating antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV infection are lost to follow-up. Causes (including HIV symptoms, quality of life, depression, herbal treatment and alcohol use) for discontinuing ART follow-up in predominantly rural resource-limited settings are not well understood. This is a prospective study of the treatment-naïve patients recruited from three (one urban, one-semi-urban and one rural) public hospitals in Uthukela health district in KwaZulu-Natal from October 2007 to February 2008. The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of loss to follow-up or all caused attrition from an ART programme within a cohort followed up for over 12 months. A total of 735 patients (217 men and 518 women) prior to initiating ART completed a baseline questionnaire and 6- and 12-months' follow-up. At 12-months follow-up 557 (75.9%) individuals continued active ART, 177 (24.1%) were all cause attrition, there were 82 deaths (13.8%), 58 (7.9%) transfers, 7 (1.0%) refused participation, 8 (1.1%) were not yet on ART and 22 (3.0%) could not be traced. Death by 12-months of follow-up was associated with lower CD4 cell counts (risk ratio, RR=2.05, confidence intervals, CI=1.20-3.49) and higher depression levels (RR=1.05, CI=1.01-1.09) at baseline assessment. The high early mortality rates indicate that patients are enrolling into ART programmes with far too advanced immunodeficiency; median CD4 cell counts 119 (IQR=59-163). Causes of late access to the ART programme, such as delays in health care access (delayed health care seeking), health system delays, or inappropriate treatment criteria, need to be addressed. Differences in health status (lower CD4 cell counts and higher depression scores) should be taken into account when initiating patients on ART. Treating depression at ART initiation is recommended to improve treatment outcome."
6590,0.004,4.0,"The introduction of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in resource-poor settings is effective in suppressing HIV-1 replication and prolonging life of infected individuals. This has led to a demand for affordable HIV-1 drug resistance assays, since treatment failure due to development of drug resistance is common. This study developed and evaluated an affordable ""in-house"" genotyping assay to monitor HIV-1 drug resistance in Africa, particularly South Africa. An ""in-house"" assay using automated RNA extraction, and subtype C specific PCR and sequencing primers was developed and successfully evaluated 396 patient samples (viral load ranges 1000-1.6 million RNA copies/ml). The ""in-house"" assay was validated by comparing sequence data and drug resistance profiles from 90 patient and 10 external quality control samples to data from the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping kit. The ""in-house"" assay was more efficient, amplifying all 100 samples, compared to 91 samples using Viroseq. The ""in house"" sequences were 99.2% homologous to the ViroSeq sequences, and identical drug resistance mutation profiles were observed in 96 samples. Furthermore, the ""in-house"" assay genotyped 260 of 295 samples from seven African sites, where 47% were non-subtype C. Overall, the newly validated ""in-house"" drug resistance assay is suited for use in Africa as it overcomes the obstacle of subtype diversity."
5021,0.004,4.0,"The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between the neurological manifestations of HIV infection, CD4+ lymphocyte count and the levels of HIV-1 RNA (viral load) in plasma. A total of 62 adult antiretroviral naïve HIV infected patients were enrolled in the study. Among them 26 had neurological complications of HIV infection (1st group), 16 patients had symptomatic disease without neurological involvements (2nd group) and 20 were asymptomatic patients (control group). Measurement of CD4 count was performed by indirect immunofluorescent assay by using the monoclonal antibodies and viral load (VL) in plasma--by RT PCR method. CD4 count was significantly lower in the 1st and 2nd group compared to the control group. There was correlation between the level of CD4 count and type of neurological manifestation. VL was comparable between the 1st and 2nd groups and was higher than in control group. There is a significant correlation between the level of CD4 count and type of neurological manifestation of HIV infection. Presence of neurological complication as well as other clinical manifestations is associated with decreased CD4 count and increased VL. Level of CD4 count can serve as an indicator for initiation of prophylaxis treatment of certain opportunistic pathogens."
5383,0.004,4.0,"To characterize WHO-defined transmitted HIV drug resistance mutation (TDRM) data from recently HIV-infected African volunteers, we sequenced HIV (pol) and evaluated for TDRM the earliest available specimens from ARV-naive volunteers diagnosed within 1 year of their estimated date of infection at eight research centers in sub-Saharan Africa. TDRMs were detected in 19/408 (5%) volunteers. The prevalence of TDRMs varied by research center, from 5/26 (19%) in Entebbe, 6/78 (8%) in Kigali, 2/49 (4%) in Kilifi, to 3/106 (3%) in Lusaka. One of five volunteers from Cape Town (20%) had TDRMs. Despite small numbers, our data suggest an increase in DRMs by year of infection in Zambia (p = 0.004). The prevalence observed in Entebbe was high across the entire study. ARV history data from 12 (63%) HIV-infected sexual partners were available; 3 reported ARV use prior to transmission. Among four partners with sequence data available, transmission linkage was confirmed and two had the same TDRMs as the newly infected volunteer (both K103N). As ARV therapy continues to increase in availability throughout Africa, monitoring incident virus strains for the presence of TDRMs should be a priority. Early HIV infection cohorts provide an excellent and important platform to monitor the development of TDRMs to inform treatment guidelines, drug choices, and strategies for secondary prevention of TDRM transmission."
3284,0.004,4.0,"Improvements in HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been accompanied by increasing recognition of the importance of adherence to treatment regimens for maximizing patient benefits while minimizing the emergence of drug-resistant virus. Whether clinicians should screen patients for adherence and only administer therapy to those believed likely to adhere has not been resolved. We first examine the implications of data drawn from a recent study reporting physicians' ability to predict whether patients will adhere to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or not. We then extend previously developed mathematical models of ART to include screening for adherence and focus on resulting drug resistance as well as on HIV and AIDS incidence at the population level. We show that although screening for adherence is likely to reduce the level of drug resistance compared with a policy of treating all HIV patients with HAART, rates of new HIV infections and AIDS cases in the population would likely increase unless screening accuracy is extremely (perhaps implausibly) high."
2350,0.004,4.0,"We present a case of renal and, probably, bone mycobacteriosis by M. szulgai in a patient infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). M. szulgai is an atypical skotochromogen mycobacterium rarely described in the literature. Clinically, it is characterized by the predominance of pulmonary manifestations undistinguishables from M. tuberculosis, and rarely affecting other organs. In our environment, such mycobacterium has never been isolated in the main series published in the literature. The evolution of the patient was good, disappearing the clinical signs after the tuberculostatic treatment. The antibiogram showed resistance to rifampicine, piracinamide and ethambutol."
9509,0.004,4.0,"The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a potent trans-activator of transcription from the viral LTR promoter. Previous mutagenesis studies have identified domains within Tat responsible for binding to its TAR RNA target and for transcriptional activation. The minimal Tat activation domain is composed of the N-terminal 48 residues, and mutational analyses identified a cluster of critical cysteines. The importance of four highly conserved aromatic amino acids within the activation domain has not been thoroughly investigated. We have systematically substituted these aromatic residues (Y26, F32, F38, Y47) of the HIV-1 LAI Tat protein with other aromatic residues (conservative mutation) or alanine (nonconservative mutation). The activity of the mutant Tat constructs was measured in different cell lines by transfection with a LTR-CAT reporter plasmid. The range of transcriptional activities measured for this set of Tat mutants allowed careful assessment of the level of Tat activity required for optimal viral replication. To test this, the mutant Tat genes were introduced into the pLAI infectious molecular clone and tested for their effect on virus replication in a T-cell line. We found that a twofold reduction in Tat activity already affects viral replication, and no virus replication was measured for Tat mutants with less than 15% activity. This strict correlation between Tat activity and viral replication demonstrates the importance of the Tat function to viral fitness. Interestingly, a less pronounced replication defect was observed in primary cell types. This finding may correlate with the frequent detection of proviruses with Tat-inactivating mutations in clinical samples."
7311,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus infection is highly endemic in China, especially in rural areas such as Dianjiang County with poor-quality health care and little local HBV information. Therefore, for the first time, the present study was carried out to investigate the molecular epidemiology, phylogeny and population dynamics of HBV based on 146 HBV-infected patients. A 435-bp portion of the HBV S region was sequenced, and the phylogeny was reconstructed, indicating that three genotypes, B, C and D of HBV were distributed in Dianjiang County. The predominant genotype is B (67.12 %), followed by C (32.19 %) and D (0.68 %). Patient demographic information and clinical outcomes were examined by genotypes, and no significant association was found. Population dynamics analysis suggested that both genotype B and C have experienced a tenfold expansion during the last five years for reasons that are unclear. Thus, a thorough molecular epidemiology investigation is strongly recommended in the future. "
1256,0.004,4.0,"Chronic inflammation caused by hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis C virus infection, and/or heavy alcohol use can lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). FIB-4 is an index score calculated from platelet count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and age that predicts fibrosis and cirrhosis. We hypothesized that high FIB-4 would be associated with development of HCC in HIV-infected persons, who are at high risk due to high prevalence of viral hepatitis and alcohol consumption, and possibly due to HIV infection itself."
5347,0.004,4.0,"This study was undertaken to evaluate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the feasibility of routine HIV screening in women undergoing various treatment of cervical neoplasia at Chiang Mai University Hospital between October 2004 and October 2006. Four hundred and ninety five women were recruited for HIV screening with the opt-out approach performed. In this study, thirty-seven (7.47%) women had a previous diagnosis of HIV infection with a mean duration 4.16 years (range: 1-15 years). The remaining 458 women consented to have an HIV test. Six women (1.31%) were newly identified as HIV seropositive, giving an overall prevalence of 8.69%. In conclusion, the prevalence of HIV infection in this study was considerably high and routine HIV screening is feasible because of the high acceptance rate."
7566,0.004,4.0,"Expression of HLA-B57 is associated with restricted replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the mechanism for its protective effect remains unknown. If this advantage depends upon CD8 T-cell recognition of B57-restricted epitopes, mother-to-child transmission of escape mutations within these epitopes could nullify its protective effect. However, if the B57 advantage is largely mediated by selection for fitness-attenuating viral mutations within B57-restricted epitopes, such as T242N in TW10-Gag, then the transmission of such mutations could facilitate viral control in the haploidentical infant. We assessed the consequences of B57-associated mutations on replication capacity, viral control, and clinical outcome after vertical transmission in 13 mother-child pairs. We found that expression of HLA-B57 was associated with exceptional control of HIV during infancy, even when mutations within TW10 and most other B57-restricted epitopes were transmitted, subverting the natural immunodominance of HLA-B57. In contrast, most B57-negative infants born to B57-positive mothers progressed rapidly to AIDS. The presence of T242N led to a reproducible reduction in viral fitness, as demonstrated by in vitro assays using NL4-3 constructs encoding p24 sequences from individual mothers and infants. Associated compensatory mutations within p24-Gag were observed to reverse this impairment and to influence the propensity of T242N to revert after transmission to B57-negative hosts. Moreover, primary failure to control viremia was observed in one infant to whom multiple compensatory mutations were transmitted along with T242N. These parallel in vivo and in vitro data suggest that HLA-B57 confers its advantage primarily by driving and maintaining a fitness-attenuating mutation in p24-Gag."
4932,0.004,4.0,"The objective was to determine the current use of their general practitioner (GP) by patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and whether such patients would be interested in having 'shared care' between a specialist HIV clinic and their GP. A questionnaire was administered to 203 HIV-positive men attending the HIV outpatient clinic of a central London teaching hospital. The main outcome measures were patient characteristics, numbers of patients registered with a GP, numbers of patients with a GP aware of their diagnosis, contacts with the GP in the last year and level of interest and shared care. Eighty-five per cent of patients were registered with a GP of whom 67% knew of the diagnosis. Those diagnosed for more than 2 years were significantly more likely to have an informed GP. A total of 73% of those registered had visited their GP in the previous year although only 27% had visited for an HIV-related problem. Only 19% had a GP actively involved in their HIV care. In all 51% of the patients indicated an interest in having shared care between the clinic and their GP. A high proportion of HIV patients are registered with and attend a GP although they rarely consult for HIV-related problems. A significant proportion of patients expressed interest in having shared care suggesting that there is the potential for increased GP involvement in the care of patients with HIV infection."
8726,0.004,4.0,"We report the first study on prevalence of antiretroviral drug-associated resistance mutations in Venezuela. Protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding regions were analyzed in DNA samples obtained from 100 HIV-1-infected individuals. Primary resistance mutations to RT inhibitors were identified in 26% of patients treated with these drugs. Transmission of HIV-1-resistant strains was detected in a drug-naive patient (3%). Primary resistance mutations to protease inhibitors (PIs) were present in 9% of the 44 PI-treated patients and in 1 PI-naive individual. Phylogenetic analysis of these samples has resulted in the most extensive survey, to date, of HIV-1 genetic forms circulating in Venezuela. Ninety-nine samples clustered with subtype B, and 1 individual harbored the first B/F recombinant virus reported in Venezuela, with protease clustering with subtype F and RT with subtype B. In addition, this isolate had a new insertion (Glu-34 duplication) in the protease gene."
9709,0.004,4.0,"The HIV and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemics are closely linked. In Thailand as part of a sentinel surveillance system, we collected data prospectively about pulmonary TB cases treated in public clinics. A subset of HIV-infected TB patients identified through this system had additional data collected for a research study. We conducted multivariate analysis to identify factors associated with MDR-TB. Of 10,428 TB patients, 2,376 (23%) were HIV-infected; 145 (1%) had MDR-TB. Of the MDR-TB cases, 52 (37%) were HIV-infected. Independent risk factors for MDR-TB included age 18-29 years old, male sex, and previous TB treatment, but not HIV infection. Among new patients, having an injection drug use history was a risk factor for MDR-TB. Of 539 HIV-infected TB patients in the research study, MDR-TB was diagnosed in 19 (4%); the only significant risk factors were previous TB treatment and previous hepatitis. In Thailand, HIV is common among MDR-TB patients, but is not an independent risk factor for MDR-TB. Populations at high risk for HIV-young adults, men, injection drug users - should be prioritized for drug susceptibility testing."
6181,0.004,4.0,"Maraviroc (Pfizer's UK-427857, Selzentry or Celsentri outside the USA) is the first agent in the new class of oral HIV-1 entry inhibitors to acquire approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine Agency. Considering the mechanism of action, it is expected that this drug will be effective only in a subpopulation of HIV-1-infected people, namely those harbouring the R5 virus. The favourable toxicity profile of the drug has been demonstrated in Phase III clinical trials in treatment-naive (MERIT) and treatment-experienced (MOTIVATE) patients. In the latter population, maraviroc showed a superior antiviral efficacy and immunological activity compared with optimized backbone therapy + placebo. However, in MERIT, a prospective double-blind, randomized trial in treatment-naive patients, maraviroc + zidovudine/lamivudine failed to prove non-inferiority to efavirenz + zidovudine/lamivudine as standard of care regimen in the 48 week intention-to-treat analysis. Using an assay with higher sensitivity for minority CXCR4-using (X4) HIV variants (the enhanced Trofile assay-Monogram), non-inferiority was reached for the maraviroc- versus efavirenz-based combination. These data indicate the important impact of the sensitivity of tropism testing on treatment outcome of maraviroc-containing regimens. This paper discusses both the prospective and retrospective analyses of the MERIT data and highlights the impact of these results on daily practice in HIV care."
1647,0.004,4.0,"In this study, we sought to characterize the T lymphocyte recovery in vertically HIV-1-infected children who respond to long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A 3-year longitudinal retrospective study was used to perform a cross-sectional study of 32 children rated according to the time course of CD4(+) T cell percentages in response to antiretroviral therapy and CDC clinical classification: (1) long-term asymptomatic (LTA group): 8 children in A1 during the whole follow-up period; (2) responsive to HAART (Rec group): 13 children in C3 before HAART who achieved CD4(+) T cell counts of > 500 cells/mm(3) after 3 years of HAART; and (3) nonresponsive to HAART (Non-Rec group): 11 children in C3 during the whole follow-up period despite 3 years of HAART. We also studied 17 healthy age-matched uninfected children as controls. Lymphoproliferative responses (LPRs) were evaluated by incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine, identification of T cell subsets by three-color flow cytometry, and determination of thymic production of T cells by quantification of T cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (TRECs). Interestingly, the Rec group showed an increase in percentage of CD4(+) T cells and a decrease in viral load, and recovered LPRs to mitogens and recall antigens, with values similar to those of the LTA group. Moreover, the Rec group produced similar percentages and absolute counts of naive (CD45RA(+)CD62L(+)) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and TRECs similar to those of the LTA group. In particular, the Rec group produced similar percentages of CD8(+)CD28(-)CD57(+) and CD8(+)CD28(-)CD57(-) T cell subsets compared with controls. Our data indicate that among children who have already progressed to AIDS and severe immunodeficiency but who respond to HAART, the immune system can recover and resemble those of nonprogressors or even uninfected children, in quantitative as well as in functional terms."
9053,0.004,4.0,"The impact of antiretroviral drug exposure and associated lipodystrophy and/or insulin resistance (IR) on advanced liver fibrosis in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients is not fully documented. We determined the prevalence of advanced liver fibrosis (defined by hepatic stiffness ≥9.5 kPa) and associated factors, focusing on the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy and its major adverse effects (lipodystrophy and IR), in 671 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients included in the ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort. One hundred ninety patients (28.3%) had advanced liver fibrosis. In univariate analysis, advanced liver fibrosis was significantly associated with male sex, higher body mass index, HCV infection through intravenous drug use, a lower absolute CD4 cell count, a longer history of antiretroviral treatment, longer durations of protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and NRTI exposure, lipodystrophy, diabetes, and a high homeostasis model assessment method (HOMA) value. The only antiretroviral drugs associated with advanced liver fibrosis were efavirenz, stavudine and didanosine. In multivariate analysis, male sex (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.5; P = 0.018), HCV infection through intravenous drug use (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.6; P = 0.018), lipodystrophy (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.3; P = 0.01), median didanosine exposure longer than 5 months (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.8; P = 0.04) and a high HOMA value (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.2; P = 0.005) remained significantly associated with advanced liver fibrosis. Mitochondrial toxicity and IR thus appear to play a key role in liver damage associated with HIV/HCV-coinfection, and this should be taken into account when selecting and optimizing antiretroviral therapy. Antiretroviral drugs with strong mitochondrial toxicity (e.g. didanosine) or a major effect on glucose metabolism should be avoided."
34,0.004,4.0,"This article critically discusses the nursing care and management of a person living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as a long-term condition, requiring highly complex HIV care. Complex HIV care is managed in the secondary care setting. However, recent legislation has motivated shifts in HIV care to the community care setting. This article aims to enhance health professionals' understanding in order to equip practice and district nurses to deliver HIV care provision. Antiretroviral adherence is a prerequisite for disease survival as well as an essential component of complete HIV self-care management. It is therefore imperative that nurses tailor adherence strategies according to each patient's requirements. Case management strategies such as the use of cognitive behavioural therapy to alleviate depressive symptoms will be considered. Furthermore, the use of motivational interviewing for antiretroviral adherence is highlighted as a potential intervention to help patients overcome the physical, psychological and physiological challenges of living with HIV-associated comorbidities. The delivery of integrated HIV care is pivotal for the management of the person living with HIV, as is the facilitation of a self-caring behaviour. "

2115,0.004,4.0,"We retrospectively studied MBP genotypes in patients with malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriage, in clinics and hospitals in The Gambia. Children under 10 years with cerebral malaria and/or severe malarial anaemia, were compared with children with symptomatic, mild malaria, and controls of the same age and ethnicity. Adult TB cases with smear-positive pulmonary TB were compared with healthy blood donors from the same ethnic groups. Malaria cases and controls were tested for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and surface antigen (HBsAg). TB patients were tested for HIV antibodies. Genotyping used sequence-specific oligonucleotide analysis to identify MBP variant alleles. Overall, 46% (944/2041) of patients and controls were homozygous for the wild-type MBP allele, 45% (922/2041) were carriers of a single variant allele and 8.6% (175/2041) had two variant alleles. Neither homozygotes nor heterozygotes for MBP variants were at increased risk of clinical malaria, persistent HBV carriage or TB. The most common mutation in Africans, the codon 57 variant allele, was weakly associated with resistance to TB (221/794 in TB cases and 276/844 in controls, p = 0.037). MBP deficiency is not a significant risk factor for persistent HBV, severe malaria nor pulmonary TB in West Africa."
4197,0.004,4.0,"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections lead to rapid depletion of CD4(+) T cells from gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Although the administration of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been shown to increase CD4(+) T-cell levels in the peripheral blood in both SIV and HIV infections, its efficacy in restoring intestinal mucosal CD4(+) T cells has not been well investigated. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of virally induced disruptions in the mucosal immune system, we have evaluated longitudinal changes in viral burden, T-cell subsets, and mucosal gene expression profiles in SIV-infected rhesus macaques in the absence or presence of ART. Our results demonstrate a dramatic suppression of mucosal viral loads and rapid reconstitution of CD4(+) T cells in GALT in animals receiving ART that were not observed in untreated SIV-infected animals. DNA microarray-based gene expression profiling indicated that CD4(+) T-cell restoration in GALT was associated with up regulation of growth factors and genes involved in repair and regeneration of the mucosal epithelium. In contrast, untreated SIV-infected animals increased expression of lymphocyte activation and inflammatory response-associated genes and did not up regulate mucosal growth and repair associated transcription. In conclusion, these data indicate that initiating ART in primary SIV infection may lead to the restoration of the mucosal immune system through reduction of inflammation and promotion of epithelial repair in the intestinal mucosa."
1574,0.004,4.0,"Medical students may have negative attitudes about persons with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as well as concerns about occupational infection with human immunodeficiency virus. We conducted a brief intervention to assess and modify attitudes of first-year students. The intervention was presented to small groups of students by peers, faculty, and a person with AIDS. Assessments of attitudes and knowledge were conducted one week prior to the intervention (pretest), and one (posttest 1) and 47 weeks (posttest 2) afterwards. Females had more positive attitudes about AIDS on pretest and posttest 1. Attitude scores improved significantly from pretest to posttest 1 but returned close to baseline by posttest 2. Knowledge scores were high on pretest and did not change significantly. Attitude scores were significantly correlated with knowledge, and with students' opinions regarding obligation to care for AIDS patients. Acquaintance with a homosexual was highly correlated with both scores. This intervention may serve as a model in improving students' attitudes about AIDS."
2558,0.004,4.0,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is implicated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related manifestations. Increased PAF synthesis has been recently detected in HIV-infected patients. In this study, we examined in naive HIV-infected patients the in vivo effects of a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen, containing tenofovir-DF/emtricitabine/efavirenz, on PAF metabolism. The specific activities of PAF basic biosynthetic enzymes, PAF-cholinephosphotransferase (PAF-CPT) and lyso-PAF-acetyltransferase (lyso-PAF-AT), but also the ones of PAF-basic catabolic enzymes, PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) in leukocytes and platelets, and lipoprotein-associated-phospholipase-A(2) (LpPLA(2)) in plasma, were measured in blood samples of eight asymptomatic naive male HIV-infected patients just before and after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment. CD4 cell counts, viral load, and several biochemical markers were also measured in the same blood samples of these patients. The repeated measures ANOVA and the Pearson r criterion were used to study statistical differences and correlations-partial correlations, while linear mixed models were conducted in order to estimate association(s) between time-dependent changes in these factors. Before treatment, the activities of PAF-CPT in leukocytes and LpPLA(2) in plasma were found to be inversely correlated with CD4 cell counts and positively correlated with the viral load. After 6 months of treatment, the activities of basic PAF-biosynthetic enzymes, PAF-CPT and lyso-PAF-AT, were both reduced in leukocytes. At 6 months, PAF-AH activity was also reduced in these cells, while LpPLA(2) remained stable. The reduction of PAF-CPT occurred even from the first month, while there is a time-dependent correlation between the increase of CD4 and the decrease of both viral load and PAF-CPT of leukocytes during treatment. Apart from its classical antiretroviral activities the tenofovir-DF/emtricitabine/efavirenz regimen also exhibited favorable effects on PAF metabolism and therefore may also display beneficial effects in some HIV-related conditions, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), in which PAF is implicated."
2521,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide, as well as the leading cause of liver transplantations in the United States. As a result of similar modes of transmission, approximately 30% of HIV-infected individuals are co-infected with HCV. Among intravenous drug users, almost 90% of people infected with HIV are also infected with HCV. Because of treatment with highly active anti-retroviral therapy, HIV-infected individuals have improved survival and are no longer suffering from opportunistic infections and malignancy as in years past. As a result, co-infection with HCV has now become a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Furthermore, liver disease secondary to HCV infection is now the leading cause of hospital deaths in HIV-infected people in the US. HIV infection accelerates the course of HCV-related liver disease and viremia. It is less clear whether HCV infection affects the clinical course of HIV; however, HCV-related liver disease can limit many individuals from receiving anti-HIV therapy. HIV/ HCV co-infection is common, and serious. Physicians caring for HIV-infected patients worldwide must now address hepatitis C virus co-infection."
464,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem, with more than 350 million people chronically infected worldwide. The chronic HBV infection in Poland is also an essential medical and social problem. Starting from 1993, a steady decline of the incidence of HBV has been observed, reaching the estimated rate of 4.5 per 100 000 in 2004. Nothing is known about the genetic variability of HBV in Poland, the occurrence and spreading of genetic variants and mutants of hepatitis B virus in the population of Polish patients during the course of the disease and in relation to antiviral treatment. It is very interesting to study the molecular epidemiology of the Polish population regarding hepatitis B virus infection as Poland is still ethnically a uniform country, with no more than 3-4% of ethnic minorities. The first results regarding distribution of HBV genotypes and serotypes in northern Poland have been published by our group in 2003 and 2004. This work was part of a scientific project supported by the Fifth Framework Programme initiative of the European Union, entitled ""Emerging variants of hepatitis B virus: new tools for epidemiological survey, diagnosis of infection, and monitoring of drug resistance"". In the course of the project more than 200 hepatitis B infected patients from the northern part of Poland have been enrolled, diagnosed and - if the viral load of HBV was suitable for analysis - genotyped by sequencing of the HBV pol/S gene fragment. This review presents the main characteristics and some interesting aspects of the studied cohort of chronically infected patients from northern Poland as well as the molecular epidemiology."

387,0.004,4.0,"A study was conducted in new patients registered with tuberculosis (TB) in a rural district of Malawi to determine (i) the prevalence of malnutrition on admission and (ii) the association between malnutrition and early mortality (defined as death within the first 4 weeks of treatment). There were 1181 patients with TB (576 men and 605 women), whose overall rate of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 80%. 673 TB patients (57%) were malnourished on admission (body mass index [BMI] < 18.5 kg/m2). There were 259 patients (22%) with mild malnutrition (BMI 17.0-18.4 kg/m2), 168 (14%) with moderate malnutrition (BMI 16.0-16.9 kg/m2) and 246 (21%) with severe malnutrition (BMI < 15.9 kg/m2). 95 patients (8%) died during the first 4 weeks. Significant risk factors for early mortality included increasing degrees of malnutrition, age > 35 years, and HIV seropositivity. Among all the 1181 patients, 10.9% of the 414 patients with moderate to severe malnutrition died in the first 4 weeks compared with 6.5% of the 767 patients with normal to mild malnutrition (odds ratio 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.1-2.7). In patients with TB, BMI < 17.0 kg/m2 is associated with an increased risk of early death."
347,0.004,4.0,"The prevalence of end-stage renal disease has increased dramatically in developing countries. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem that represents a significant co-morbidity event that has led to outbreaks of hepatitis B. There are inadequate data concerning occult HBV infection among Egyptian chronic hemodialysis patients. This study aimed to detect occult HBV infection among chronic hemodialysis patients in Alexandria, Egypt. A cross-sectional study was performed on 100 patients with end-stage renal disease that received maintenance hemodialysis and had tested negative for HBV surface antigen. Blood samples were collected before the initiation of hemodialysis. Sera were tested for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B core (HBc) antibodies using ELISA, and HBV DNA was detected by SYBR Green real-time PCR using specific primers for the s and c genes and by nested PCR using pol gene-specific primers. The serum activity of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST) were also measured. Anti-HCV and anti-HBc antibodies were detected in 34% and 48% of patients, respectively, and 70.6% of anti-HCV positive patients were also positive for anti-HBc antibodies. This association was statistically significant (p=0.001). HBV DNA was detected in 32% of the hemodialysis patients. A significant association was determined between the presence of HBV DNA and anti-HCV positivity (p=0.021). Aminotransferases were elevated in 21% of the studied patients, more often in patients with positive anti-HCV profiles than in patients negative for anti-HCV (p<0.05). In conclusion, the serological markers of HBV infection should be verified with molecular tests to investigate possible occult infections, especially among anti-HBc-positive hemodialysis patients, to improve our understanding of their clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological characteristics.

5703,0.004,4.0,"With ongoing earlier enrollment on and rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Cameroon, there are increasing risks of transmitted HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) at population levels. We, therefore, evaluated the threshold of HIVDR in a population initiating ART, to inform on the effectiveness of first-line regimens, considering HIV-1 diversity, plasma viral load (PVL), and CD4-based disease progression. A total of 53 adults [median (interquartile range, IQR) CD4: 162 cell/mm(3) (48-284); median (IQR) PVL: 5.34 log10 RNA (4.17-6.42) copies/ml] initiating ART in 2014 at the Yaoundé Central Hospital were enrolled for HIV-1 protease-reverse transcriptase sequencing. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were interpreted using the 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) list versus the Stanford HIVdb algorithm version 7.0. Level of DRMs was low (3.77%) versus moderate (7.55%), respectively, following the WHO list (T69D, K103N) versus Stanford HIVdb (T69D, A98G, K103N, K238T), respectively. Prevailing clade was CRF02_AG (71.70%). Based on Stanford HIVdb, a slightly higher proportion of patients with DRMs were found among ones infected with CRF02_AG than in those non-CRF02_AG infected (7.89% vs. 6.67%, p = 1.000), with lower PVL (7.69% <5.5 vs. 0% ≥5.5 log10 RNA copies/ml, p = .488) and with higher CD4 counts (9.52% CD4 ≥200 vs. 3.33% CD4 <200 cells/mm(3), p = .749). Thresholds of DRMs suggest that standard first-line regimens currently used in Cameroon may remain effective at population levels, despite scale-up of ART in the country, pending adherence, and closed virological monitoring. With an intent-to-diagnose approach, the discrepant levels of DRMs support using Stanford HIVdb to evaluate initial ART, while revising the WHO list for surveillance."
2029,0.004,4.0,"Occult hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) is characterized by HBV DNA positivity but HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negativity. Occult HBV infection is associated with a risk of HBV transmission through blood transfusion, hemodialysis, and liver transplantation. Furthermore, occult HBV infection contributes to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We recently reported the characteristic molecular features of mutations in the preS/S regions among Korean individuals with occult infections caused by HBV genotype C2; the variants of preS and S related to severe liver diseases among chronically infected patients were also responsible for the majority of HBV occult infections. We also reported that HBsAg variants from occult-infected Korean individuals exhibit lower HBsAg secretion capacity but not reduced HBV DNA levels. In addition, these variants exhibit increased ROS-inducing capacity compared with the wild-type strain, linking HBV occult infections to liver cell damage. Taken together, our previous reports suggest the transmission potential of distinct HBV occult infection-related variants in South Korea. "

There was considerable overlap and transitioning between crack smoking and injecting. Crack users were also significantly more likely to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual than other drug users. In multivariate analysis, HIV infection was independently associated with crack use and with being gay or bisexual. In New York City, HIV prevention for drug users has focused on syringe access, safe injection, and drug user treatment, but further progress in HIV control will require strategies to address sexual health among people who use drugs. The study's limitations are noted."
7365,0.004,4.0,"We evaluated, for the first time in Latin America, the performance of a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Calypte Biomedical Corporation, Berkeley, Calif.) that detects human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific antibodies in urine in comparison to standard serological assays (two commercial EIAs and a commercial Western blot [WB] assay). Paired serum and urine specimens were collected from two different groups of Brazilian patients: 225 drug users with unknown HIV status who attended drug treatment centers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and 135 subjects with known HIV status. Patients showing positive results in the serum EIAs and/or in the urine EIA were serologically confirmed by WB assay. For 135 individuals with known HIV status, the urine EIA showed 100% sensitivity (74 positive samples) and 95.1% specificity (58 of 61 negative specimens). For 225 drug users, the test showed 100% sensitivity (2 positive samples) and 98.7% specificity (220 of 223 negative samples) compared to WB-confirmed serological EIA results. Thus, in a total of 360 samples, the urine EIA correctly identified all 76 HIV-positive samples and 278 of 284 negative samples (100% sensitivity and 97.9% specificity). Detailed analysis of the urine EIA results indicates that an increase of the recommended cutoff value might raise the specificity of the assay without affecting its sensitivity. Our results suggest that the HIV-1 urine EIA is a good screening test suitable for developing countries like Brazil. However, as for all other HIV screening tests on the market, it is not specific enough to be used as a one-step test and therefore requires confirmation."
7666,0.004,4.0,"National programmes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination are recommended by the World Health Organization for all countries. Countries suffering the highest burden of HBV disease are those most needy of universal vaccination, but are frequently of very low income and resources for health care are scarce. The introduction of HBV vaccination would inevitably stretch these resources further even with support of donor agencies. Thus an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of HBV vaccination is desirable to assist in decision making about resource allocation. We describe here a method for estimating the additional costs of introducing HBV vaccination into the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) at a national level. Of fundamental importance is that this method enables costs to be assessed prior to the introduction of vaccination. We illustrate the method using a study carried out at the sub-national level, in the city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, but which can be expanded countrywide. The method, in brief, involved the use of a number of questionnaires which could be used to estimate the costs associated with the EPI programme from a large sample of the static clinics as well as from central sources. Since unit costs were collected along with the quantities of resources used and estimates of the capacity used for certain facilities (such as refrigerators), the additional cost of introducing HBV vaccine could be estimated largely by extrapolation of the resources used in vaccinating against diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus vaccine (which, similar to HBV vaccine, requires three doses). The estimation of costs is only part of the information required to make decisions on resource allocation, and should be used in association with measures of the burden of disease due to the infection in the community and effectiveness of the control programme at reducing this burden. The prediction of the latter, based upon a sound epidemiological understanding of the infection, is the subject of a forthcoming paper."
9409,0.004,4.0,"Ribavirin was administered orally in escalating doses for 2 or 4 weeks to 15 symptom-free, human immunodeficiency virus seropositive homosexual men with generalized lymphadenopathy. Reverse transcriptase activity was inhibited during therapy when steady-state plasma concentrations were greater than 6 mumol/L. These concentrations were achieved with 1200 or 2400 mg/day for 2 weeks or a loading dose of 2400 mg/day for 3 days followed by 600 mg/day for 4 weeks. Drug accumulation occurred at all doses. The elimination half-life appeared to be approximately 2 weeks. Reversible adverse reactions, principally resulting in central nervous system symptoms and anemia, correlated with dose and duration of therapy. Immunologic enhancement of T-lymphocyte-mediated mitogen-induced responses was observed in the majority of patients who had reduction in reverse transcriptase activity. However, specific T4+ lymphocyte-mediated antigen-induced responses increased to within the normal range in only three patients. Significant enhancement appeared to correlate with the severity of baseline antigen-induced functional impairment. These data indicate that oral ribavirin can be given for at least 1 month with acceptable toxicity at doses that appear to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus replication."
9020,0.004,4.0,"There is an increase in the cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity in individuals infected with HIV that may be due to inflammatory lipid modulation not captured by traditional lipid measures. The objective of this study was to perform advanced lipoprotein phenotyping inclusive of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol efflux capacity and lipoprotein particle concentration and size in a well-phenotyped group of 118 patients infected with HIV. We used simple and multivariable analyses to determine the associations between advanced lipoprotein parameters and known cardiometabolic risk factors. Participants were on stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) and had benign traditional lipid panels [median total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides of 178 mg/dl, 108 mg/dl, 44 mg/dl, and 122.5 mg/dl, respectively]. However, advanced lipoprotein phenotyping demonstrated an elevation of LDL particle number (median of 1,233 nmol/liter) and a decrease in LDL size (median of 20.4 nm), along with a decrease in protective, large HDL particles (median of 3.15 μmol/liter) and reduced HDL cholesterol efflux capacity in comparison to controls of other studies. HDL cholesterol efflux capacity was associated with HDL levels (β=0.395, p<0.001), small LDL particle concentration (β=-0.198, p=0.031), insulin sensitivity by the Matsuda index (β=0.218, p=0.029), and the Framingham Risk Score (β=-0.184, p=0.046). We demonstrate an atherogenic lipoprotein profile by NMR spectroscopy and HDL efflux measurement in a group of HIV-infected patients on stable ART with normal lipid panels."
3943,0.004,4.0,"There is evidence that the life expectancy (LE) of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has increased since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, mortality rates in recent years in HIV-positive individuals appear to have remained higher than would be expected based on rates seen in the general population. A low CD4 count, whether due to late HIV diagnosis, late initiation of cART, or incomplete adherence to cART, remains the dominant predictor of LE, and thus the individual's disease stage at initiation of cART (or thereafter) certainly contributes to these higher mortality rates. However, individuals with HIV also tend to exhibit lifestyles and behaviors that place them at increased risk of mortality, particularly from non-AIDS causes. Thus, although mortality rates among the HIV population may indeed remain slightly higher than those seen in the general population, they may be no higher than those seen in a more appropriately matched control group. Thus, further improvements in LE may now only be possible if some of the other underlying issues (for example, modification of lifestyle or behavioral factors) are tackled."

Behavioral changes observed in clinical studies of HIV-infected children suggest alterations in dopaminergic neurotransmission. Findings from our model of choice, the HIV-1 transgenic rat, reveal a significant increase in phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase protein expression and a decrease in dopamine transporter mRNA, without changes in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or dopamine transporter (DAT) protein or in more general markers of protein and gene expression levels in the HIV-1 transgenic rat midbrain. Thus these findings suggest selective vulnerability of the dopamine system in developing brains to HIV-1 infection."
2911,0.004,4.0,"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the elevation of liver enzyme and/or bilirubin levels caused by the use of a medication or drug. In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, some of these events may not be directly caused by medication. Acute viral hepatitis, reactivation of hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and/or alcohol use may play roles. Elevated transaminase levels are a signal of liver injury, but most cases improve despite continuation of drug therapy. Approximately 33% of patients with HIV infection are coinfected with HCV. Patients with HIV or HCV infection are more prone to DILI, possibly because of impaired hepatocyte defense mechanisms. HCV coinfection is associated with a 2-10-fold chance of developing elevated transaminase levels during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Patients with HIV/HCV coinfection should not be denied HAART. Instead, they should be followed-up with monthly liver function tests and referred to specialists if grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme elevations occur."
2102,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive individuals who adhere to their antiretroviral (ARV) regimens are more likely to achieve suppressed HIV viral load and improved immunologic response; however, for most patients, medication adherence remains a challenge. Prior studies have shown that clinical pharmacists contribute to the management of HIV-infected patients; but due to variability in clinical responsibilities and study limitations, their value has not been fully realized. The objective of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes of an HIV clinical pharmacist's interventions at Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, who utilizes medication expertise to provide recommendations for ARV regimen changes. The pharmacist suggests new ARV regimens in order to attain virologic suppression, improve immunologic response, or minimize ARV adverse effects, while aiming to optimize patients' adherence by decreasing pill burden and/or dosing frequency. This retrospective study assessed the effectiveness of the pharmacist's interventions that occurred between 11 September 2006 and 30 September 2008 on pill burden, dosing frequency, and medication adherence. Additionally, CD4+ cell count and HIV viral load pre- and post-intervention were evaluated. Medication adherence was assessed utilizing electronic pharmacy refill records and calculated based on the formula: [(pills dispensed/pills prescribed per day)/days between refills] x 100. From a cohort of 75 patients, mean daily pill quantity and dosing frequency decreased from 7.2 pills/day and 2.0 times/day in the control phase to 5.4 pills/day and 1.5 times/day in the study phase, respectively ( p < 0.001). Medication adherence increased from a mean of 81% in the control phase to 89% in the study phase ( p = 0.003). Clinical outcomes measured by CD4+cell count and CD4% were statistically improved and more individuals achieved undetectable HIV viral loads postintervention ( p < 0.001). In conclusion, HIV clinical pharmacists may play an important role in reducing pill burden and dosing frequency, increasing medication adherence, and improving clinical outcomes."
8451,0.004,4.0,"To determine the influence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CD8+ T cells on the development of drug resistance mutations in the HIV-1 protease, we analyzed protease sequences from viruses from a human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA class I)-typed cohort of 94 HIV-1-positive individuals. In univariate statistical analyses (Fisher's exact test), minor and major drug resistance mutations as well as drug-associated polymorphisms showed associations with HLA class I alleles. All correlations with P values of 0.05 or less were considered to be relevant without corrections for multiple tests. A subset of these observed correlations was experimentally validated by enzyme-linked immunospot assays, allowing the definition of 10 new epitopes recognized by CD8+ T cells from patients with the appropriate HLA class I type. Several drug resistance-associated mutations in the protease acted as escape mutations; however, cells from many patients were still able to generate CD8+ T cells targeting the escape mutants. This result presumably indicates the usage of different T-cell receptors by CD8+ T cells targeting these epitopes in these patients. Our results support a fundamental role for HLA class I-restricted immune responses in shaping the sequence of the HIV-1 protease in vivo. This role may have important clinical implications both for the understanding of drug resistance pathways and for the design of therapeutic vaccines targeting drug-resistant HIV-1."
9387,0.004,4.0,"Measurement of quality of life is crucial to assess the full impact of antiretroviral therapy on patient morbidity. No quality of life instruments have been validated in an Asian HIV-infected patient population, but it is important to do so given the increasing involvement of the region in clinical trials. We set out to validate the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) in HIV infected patients in Singapore. Clinically stable outpatients were asked to complete the 30-item MOS-HIV (English or Chinese translation). Patients were also asked about the frequency of selected disease symptoms, and clinical and demographic data were recorded from the case sheet. 163 patients (90% Chinese, 96% male, mean age 38 years, mean CD4 count 159 cells/mm(3)) participated in the study and completed the questionnaire to a satisfactory standard. The questionnaire showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha >0.7 in all cases). There were significant differences in quality of life scores between Centers for Disease Control disease stages, and significant correlations with CD4 count and symptom score, confirming the discriminant validity of the MOS-HIV. Factor analysis revealed two components corresponding to physical and mental health which were similar to those of studies in Western countries except that pain was more closely related to mental than physical health. Linear regression analysis identified symptom burden as the major predictor of physical and mental health. We concluded that the MOS-HIV is a valid measure of quality of life in this HIV patient population in Singapore, and is therefore likely to be useful in future clinical trials in the region. In the era of chronic HIV disease, close attention to symptoms (disease or drug-related) is warranted due to their major adverse influence on mental and physical aspects of quality of life."
9224,0.004,4.0,"The impact of hepatitis C virus infection (HCI), the most common bloodborne virus infection in the USA, on outcome of active tuberculosis (TB) treatment is largely unknown. We aimed to describe characteristics of TB patients with hepatitis C virus infection (TB-HCI) in King County, Washington, including TB treatment duration and outcome. We reviewed 1510 records of patients treated for active TB at the Public Health - Seattle & King County Tuberculosis Control Program between 2000 and 2010, and identified 53 with HCI. Advanced age, being born in the USA, HIV infection, homelessness and injection drug use were independently associated with HCI in TB cases. Independent factors associated with increased treatment duration included HIV infection, excess alcohol use, extrapulmonary TB, and any drug-resistant TB disease. Our findings suggest that TB-HCI patients can be successfully treated for active TB without extending treatment duration."
2940,0.004,4.0,"Objective To assess the implementation of HIV-related interventions for patients with tuberculosis (TB), as well as TB treatment outcomes in patients coinfected with HIV in Brazil in 2011. Methods This was a cross-sectional, operational research study of HIV-related interventions among TB cases and the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of TB-HIV coinfected patients. It also used a retrospective cohort design to determine the association between antiretroviral therapy (ART) and favorable TB treatment outcomes. The source of data was a linkage of 2011 administrative health databases used by the National TB and HIV/AIDS Programs. Results Of 73 741 new cases of TB reported, 63.6% (46 865 patients) were tested for HIV; 10.3% were positive. Of patients with HIV, 45.9% or 3 502 were on ART. TB favorable outcome was achieved in 63.1% or 2 205 coinfected patients on ART and in only 35.4% or 1 459 of those not on ART. On multivariate analysis, the relative risk for the association between ART and TB treatment success was 1.72 (95% Confidence Interval = 1.64-1.81). Conclusions The linkage between national TB and HIV datasets has created a convenient baseline for ongoing monitoring of HIV testing, ART use, and TB treatment outcomes among coinfected patients. The low rates of HIV screening and ART use in 2011 need to be improved. The association between ART and treatment success adds to the evidence supporting timely initiation of ART for all patients with TB-HIV coinfection."
2199,0.004,4.0,"The study aimed to investigate the association of prevalent genotypes in China (HBV/C and HBV/B) with HBV drug-resistant mutations. A total of 13,847 nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA)-treated patients with chronic HBV infection from North China were enrolled. HBV genotypes and resistant mutations were determined by direct sequencing and confirmed by clonal sequencing if necessary. HBV/B, HBV/C, and HBV/D occupied 14.3%, 84.9%, and 0.8% across the study population, respectively. NA usage had no significant difference between HBV/B- and HBV/C-infected patients. Lamivudine-resistant mutations were more frequently detected in HBV/C-infected patients, compared with HBV/B-infected patients (31.67% vs. 25.26%, p < 0.01). Adefovir- and entecavir-resistant mutation detection rates were similar, but the mutational pattern was different between the two genotypes. For adefovir-resistant mutations, HBV/C-infected patients had a higher detection rate of rtA181 V (HBV/C 5.29% vs. HBV/B 1.36%, p < 0.01) and a lower detection rate of rtN236T (2.70% vs. 6.54%, p < 0.01). For entecavir-resistant mutations, HBV/C-infected patients had a higher detection rate of rtM204 V/I+T184 substitution or S202G/C (3.66% vs. 2.16%, p < 0.01) and a lower detection rate of rtM204 V/I+M250 V/I/L substitution (0.67% vs. 1.46%, p < 0.01). Multidrug-resistant mutations (defined as coexistence of mutation to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues) were detected in 104 patients. HBV/C-infected patients had a higher detection rate of multidrug-resistant mutation than HBV/B-infected patients (0.83% vs. 0.35%, p < 0.05). The study for the first time clarified that HBV/C-infected patients had a higher risk to develop multidrug-resistant mutations, compared with HBV/B-infected patients; and HBV/C- and HBV/B-infected patients had different inclinations in the ETV-resistant mutational pattern."
4469,0.004,4.0,"Hospital infection control measures are crucial to tuberculosis (TB) control strategies within settings caring for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, as these patients are at heightened risk of developing TB. Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a potent drug that effectively sterilizes persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli. However, PZA resistance associated with mutations in the nicotinamidase/pyrazinamidase coding gene, pncA, is increasing. A total of 794 patient isolates obtained from four sites in Lima, Peru, underwent spoligotyping and drug resistance testing. In one of these sites, the HIV unit of Hospital Dos de Mayo (HDM), an isolation ward for HIV/TB coinfected patients opened during the study as an infection control intervention: circulating genotypes and drug resistance pre- and postintervention were compared. All other sites cared for HIV-negative outpatients: genotypes and drug resistance rates from these sites were compared with those from HDM. HDM patients showed high concordance between multidrug resistance, PZA resistance according to the Wayne method, the two most common genotypes (spoligotype international type [SIT] 42 of the Latino American-Mediterranean (LAM)-9 clade and SIT 53 of the T1 clade), and the two most common pncA mutations (G145A and A403C). These associations were absent among community isolates. The infection control intervention was associated with 58-92% reductions in TB caused by SIT 42 or SIT 53 genotypes (odds ratio [OR] = 0.420, P = 0.003); multidrug-resistant TB (OR = 0.349, P < 0.001); and PZA-resistant TB (OR = 0.076, P < 0.001). In conclusion, pncA mutation typing, with resistance testing and spoligotyping, was useful in identifying a nosocomial TB outbreak and demonstrating its resolution after implementation of infection control measures."
6274,0.004,4.0,"The social stigma in patients with hepatitis B virus infection has caused several complications for both the patients and the associated medical system. This study aimed at demonstrating the social stigma experienced by these patients in Iran. This is a qualitative study using a content analysis approach with references to primary and secondary sources. The data were collected through 15 unstructured and in-depth interviews conducted in 2014. By analyzing the data, two main themes were noted: extrinsic concepts of social stigma (causing reprehension, embarrassment, and discrimination) and intrinsic concepts of social stigma (sense of rejection, isolation, and frustration). The analysis of participants' experiences showed that social stigma is a simple lack of knowledge among the patients and society and it is more intense in the first days after the diagnosis. Stigma is prevalent among patients with hepatitis B virus, causes them to hide the disease, and provokes various complications for them as well as society. This study emphasizes the necessity of implementing health education programs about hepatitis B and its associated stigma, especially considering the potential impact of a mass media campaign."

Nevertheless, HBV does not preclude entry into a health care profession, and the risk of transmission from health care worker to patient is not uniform across the spectrum of health care fields. In the present article, the authors present an overview of the literature regarding transmission of HBV from the health care worker to the patient, and the current recommendations that vary from province to province within Canada. The establishment of national guidelines to standardize monitoring of HBV infection among health care workers would improve health care workplace safety and patient care."
9201,0.004,4.0,"Mutations in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) core gene may influence disease activity by altering immune recognition sites or level of virus replication. Sera from 69 Chinese patients with chronic HBV infection were analyzed by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction amplification of HBV DNA to determine the frequency and location of naturally occurring HBV core gene mutations. All but one patient had nucleotide changes, and 44 (64%) patients had at least one amino acid change (mean, 3.7; range, 1-13) when compared with published sequences. Multiple regression analysis showed that the frequency of core gene mutations was significantly associated with precore stop-codon mutation, hepatitis B e antigen negativity, and active liver disease, but not patients' age. The mean number of amino acid changes/patient for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients with elevated versus normal aminotransferase levels were, respectively, 2.8 +/- 0.4 and 0.6 +/- 0.2. The corresponding values for HBeAg-negative patients were, respectively, 5.0 +/- 1.2 and 6.0 +/- 1.5. Thirteen patients were serially studied, the mean rates of amino acid substitution in HBeAg-positive patients who did or did not clear HBeAg during follow-up were 5.7 +/- 0.8 and 0 per codon/yr. Most of the mutations were clustered in the codon/yr. Most of the mutations were clustered in the middle of the core gene that harbor several major B- and helper T-cell epitopes. Very few mutations were found in the C-terminal part of the core gene. In summary, mutations in the core gene can be frequently detected in patients with chronic HBV infection. These mutations occur predominantly around the time of HBeAg clearance when liver disease is most active."
5558,0.004,4.0,"In The Netherlands, in May 1999 an enhanced surveillance of hepatitis B was begun to collect detailed information of patients with acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The objective was to gain insight in transmission routes and source of infection of new HBV cases. Through public health services, patients were interviewed on risk factors. It appeared that the majority (59%) acquired the infection through sexual contact; 52% of these by homosexual and 48% by heterosexual contact. In 60% of the heterosexual cases, the source of infection was a partner originating from a hepatitis B-endemic region. Sexual transmission is the most common route of transmission of acute hepatitis B in The Netherlands and introduction of infections from abroad plays a key role in the current epidemiology of HBV. As well as prevention programmes targeted at sexual high-risk groups, prevention efforts should focus more on the heterosexual transmission from HBV carriers."

3150,0.004,4.0,"In a qualitative study, 20 HIV-infected Australian gay men were interviewed about their decision not to access antiretroviral drug therapy. The main reasons given for the decision were fear of side effects; fear of long-term damage to body organs; the inconvenience of the treatment regimens; belief that the regimen's demands would be a threat to morale; and belief that there was no reason to start therapy in the absence of AIDS-related symptoms. Actions taken by the men to monitor and maintain their health included seeing a doctor regularly; having regular T-cell and viral load tests; and trying to maintain a positive outlook by not letting HIV/AIDS 'take over' their lives. Almost half the men considered they had been subjected to unreasonable pressure to access therapy and there was considerable pride at having resisted this pressure. The findings suggest that the men disagreed with the biomedical model for managing HIV/AIDS only on the question of if and when to access therapy. They also suggest that underlying the men's dissent from the biomedical model was a different mode of thinking than is required by the model: while the model demands thinking that is abstract, the men focused strongly on factors close to the 'here and now' of immediate experience. The practical implications of the findings are explored."
4988,0.004,4.0,"Primary HIV-1 infection induces a virus-specific adaptive/cytolytic immune response that impacts the plasma viral load set point and the rate of progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) suppresses plasma viremia to undetectable levels that rebound upon cART treatment interruption. Following cART withdrawal, the memory component of the virus-specific adaptive immune response may improve viral control compared to primary infection. Here, using primary infection and treatment interruption data from macaques infected with simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), we observe a lower peak viral load but an unchanged viral set point during viral rebound. The addition of an autologous stem cell transplant before cART withdrawal alters viral dynamics: we found a higher rebound set point but similar peak viral loads compared to the primary infection. Mathematical modeling of the data that accounts for fundamental immune parameters achieves excellent fit to heterogeneous viral loads. Analysis of model output suggests that the rapid memory immune response following treatment interruption does not ultimately lead to better viral containment. Transplantation decreases the durability of the adaptive immune response following cART withdrawal and viral rebound. Our model's results highlight the impact of the endogenous adaptive immune response during primary SHIV infection. Moreover, because we capture adaptive immune memory and the impact of transplantation, this model will provide insight into further studies of cure strategies inspired by the Berlin patient."
8085,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) invades the central nervous system (CNS) during acute infection which can result in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in up to 50% of patients, even in the presence of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Within the CNS, productive HIV-1 infection occurs in the perivascular macrophages and microglia. Astrocytes also become infected, although their infection is restricted and does not give rise to new viral particles. The major barrier to the elimination of HIV-1 is the establishment of viral reservoirs in different anatomical sites throughout the body and viral persistence during long-term treatment with cART. While the predominant viral reservoir is believed to be resting CD4(+) T cells in the blood, other anatomical compartments including the CNS, gut-associated lymphoid tissue, bone marrow, and genital tract can also harbour persistently infected cellular reservoirs of HIV-1. Viral latency is predominantly responsible for HIV-1 persistence and is most likely governed at the transcriptional level. Current clinical trials are testing transcriptional activators, in the background of cART, in an attempt to purge these viral reservoirs and reverse viral latency. These strategies aim to activate viral transcription in cells constituting the viral reservoir, so they can be recognised and cleared by the immune system, while new rounds of infection are blocked by co-administration of cART. The CNS has several unique characteristics that may result in differences in viral transcription and in the way latency is established. These include CNS-specific cell types, different transcription factors, altered immune surveillance, and reduced antiretroviral drug bioavailability. A comprehensive understanding of viral transcription and latency in the CNS is required in order to determine treatment outcomes when using transcriptional activators within the CNS."
4792,0.004,4.0,"HIV-1 infection alters expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 on CD4 T cells in adults, although an effect by virus on expression of coreceptor genes in pediatric subjects is unknown. We designed an exploratory study to evaluate surface expression of CXCR4 and CCR5 on CD45RA and CD45RO subsets of CD4 T lymphocytes from 17 HIV-1-infected infants and adolescents and 16 healthy age-matched individuals. While age in the absence of HIV-1 infection was unrelated to coreceptor expression, infection affected coreceptor expression differentially in infants and adolescents. Among infected adolescents, CCR5 and CXCR4 expression was significantly increased on CD4 CD45RO T cells, while CXCR4 was diminished in the CD4 CD45RA subset. Although HIV-1 infection in infants was also associated with increased CXCR4 expression on the CD4 CD45RO subset, in contrast to adolescents, infection in infants had no impact on coreceptor expression within the CD45RA CD4 subset. The proportion of CD4 T cells coexpressing CD45RA and CD45RO was increased by infection in both infants and adolescents. The CD45RA CD45RO subset in culture expressed high levels of CD4, CXCR4, and CD69, an early activation marker, and was highly susceptible to HIV-1 infection and replication. Infection of transitional CD4 T cells coexpressing CD45RA and CD45RO could contribute in part to provirus in either CD45RA or CD45RO subsets. Deleterious effects by HIV-1 infection on CD4 T cell homeostasis were greater in infants then adolescents, indicating that adolescence may be an optimal age group for assessing vaccines to prevent or treat HIV-1 infection."
5114,0.004,4.0,"A wide range of pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, dengue virus, Mycobacterium, Leishmania, and Helicobacter pylori, can interact with dendritic cell (DC)-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), expressed on DCs and a subset of B cells. More specifically, the interaction of the gp120 envelope protein of HIV-1 with DC-SIGN can facilitate the transfer of virus to CD4+ T lymphocytes in trans and enhance infection. We have previously demonstrated that a multimeric LeX component in human milk binds to DC-SIGN, preventing HIV-1 from interacting with this receptor. Biochemical analysis reveals that the compound is heat resistant, trypsin sensitive, and larger than 100 kDa, indicating a specific glycoprotein as the inhibitory compound. By testing human milk from three different mothers, we found the levels of DC-SIGN binding and viral inhibition to vary between samples. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization analysis, we identified bile salt-stimulated lipase (BSSL), a Lewis X (LeX)-containing glycoprotein found in human milk, to be the major variant protein between the samples. BSSL isolated from human milk bound to DC-SIGN and inhibited the transfer of HIV-1 to CD4+ T lymphocytes. Two BSSL isoforms isolated from the same human milk sample showed differences in DC-SIGN binding, illustrating that alterations in the BSSL forms explain the differences observed. These results indicate that variations in BSSL lead to alterations in LeX expression by the protein, which subsequently alters the DC-SIGN binding capacity and the inhibitory effect on HIV-1 transfer. Identifying the specific molecular interaction between the different forms may aid in the future design of antimicrobial agents."

9525,0.004,4.0,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most prevalent AIDS-associated tumour, occurring in 20-30% of HIV-1-infected individuals in the early 1980s. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically reduced the incidence of the disease and might therefore support the concept of 'opportunistic malignancies' requiring immune impairments to occur. The relationship between the immune system and the epidemiology of this virus-induced tumour is of importance in order to identify new therapeutic approaches for treating or preventing its occurrence. As a model of impaired angiogenesis, therapeutic options for treating AIDS patients with KS should therefore target cell division, anti-angiogenic processes, immune modulators, cytokines and potentially antiviral drugs."
7107,0.004,4.0,"Development of drug resistance is the inevitable consequence of incomplete suppression of virus plasma levels in HIV-1-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy. Resistance mutations previously characterized have been found in B subtype viruses of developed countries. Moreover, mutation profiles for non-B and more divergent B subtype viruses found in developing countries shall be analyzed together with their ex vivo phenotyping in order to establish an exact correlation between the genotyping data and the clinical management counseling for those uncommon virus subtypes. In the present study, we evaluated the mutation profile for individuals infected with B subtype and non-B subtype viruses. Viral DNA fragments corresponding to the RT gene were amplified, sequenced, and subtyped. Phenotyping analysis for reverse transcriptase nucleoside (NRTI) and nonnucleoside inhibitor susceptibility was performed using the recombinant virus assay technology. Brazilian non-B subtypes (subtype F, n = 4, and subtype A, n = 1) isolates showed essentially the same B subtype mutation profile, presenting an NRTI drug resistance with similar MIC50% and MIC90% values for all drugs analyzed regardless of their subtypes. A strong cross-resistance phenotype among AZT, 3TC, and abacavir could be seen in all isolates analyzed. A novel result was that some RT sequences not only revealed the presence of G333D/E mutations but also correlated to the presence of mutation T386I that could abrogate the M184V-surpassing effect of L210W or L210W plus G333D/E. These findings suggest that Brazilian non-B subtype HIV-1 strains use an identical RT drug resistance mutation pattern when compared to B isolates and will contribute to the validation of the genotypic and phenotypic tests in these predominant worldwide-spread viral variants."
8220,0.004,4.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are leading causes of death from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States. Because underreporting has complicated the understanding of disease burden, in 2010 the Institute of Medicine requested that CDC perform a comprehensive evaluation of national viral hepatitis surveillance. Hepatitis surveillance data rely on local and state estimates, and a better understanding of reporting at these levels can inform strategies to improve national data quality. As an initial assessment, CDC partnered with the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) and an urban health-care system in southeastern Michigan to evaluate the completeness of reporting (including case status, demographic, and risk factor information) of cases of chronic HBV and HCV infection among persons who were enrolled in a multicenter chronic hepatitis cohort study to the MDCH viral hepatitis registry. This report summarizes the results of that assessment. Among clinically confirmed chronic hepatitis infections, 82% of HBV infections and 65% of HCV infections were reported. Completeness of reporting of chronic HBV and HCV infections was significantly improved for those with more recent clinical diagnoses, but reporting still remained incomplete. The completeness of reporting varied significantly by demographic characteristics of patients with HCV infection. Few reports of either HBV or HCV infection included risk factors. Improving surveillance of chronic hepatitis in Michigan will require exploration of more efficient methods for the transfer of laboratory and clinical data and evaluation of the most appropriate sources for risk factor information to aid in the prevention of viral hepatitis transmission. Similar collaborations with health-care institutions that use electronic International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes and laboratory data can provide local and state health departments with insight into the challenges to case reporting in their jurisdictions."
1437,0.004,4.0,"Chronic hepatitis B is still a major public health problem, aggravated by the growing phenomenon of immigration from areas with a high prevalence of infection with this virus. In the last few years, marked progress has been achieved in diagnostic methods, knowledge of the natural history of the disease and in therapeutic options, including liver transplantation, which has improved survival in these patients. These advances have been accompanied by an increase in the complexity of decision making. Six treatments have currently been approved for hepatitis B, including two interferon formulations--standard and pegylated--and four neucleos(t)ide analogs, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir and telbivudine, as well as two further drugs that are used in patients coinfected with HIV, tenofovir and emtricitabine. However, none of the current treatments is able to eradicate the virus and consequently prolonged treatments are often required with the consequent risk of generating resistance. For this reason, as well as the heterogeneity of the natural history of the disease, there is a lack of consensus on the indications for treatment and the parameters in which treatment should be based, the most suitable drug or drug combination, and the criteria to be used to continue, modify or suspend treatment. Therefore, despite the enormous progress made, numerous questions remain that make the clinical management of these patients a major challenge."

Uni-Gold Recombigen HIV was used as the screening test, followed by HIV-1/2 STAT-PAK for reactive samples. OraQuick HIV-1 testing was performed if the first two test results were discordant. This algorithm was then tested with 5,252 blood donor samples, and the results were compared to those of enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and Western blotting. The unadjusted algorithm sensitivity and specificity were 98.6 and 99.9%, respectively. The adjusted sensitivity and specificity were 100 and 99.96%, respectively.

Briefly boiling diluted plasma releases all complexed antigen, which can then be measured by some commercial assays. In a retrospective pediatric cohort study, the specificity of this procedure in 390 uninfected samples was 96.9% after initial testing and 100% after neutralization. Sensitivity among 125 postnatal infected samples was, at a detection of 2 pg/mL, 96.0% (97% neutralizable) compared with 47.7% for regular antigen (76% neutralizable), 96% for polymerase chain reaction, and 77% for viral culture. The high sensitivity and specificity of heat-denatured antigen was confirmed by prospectively testing 113 additional samples. Quantitative analysis of samples from infected infants showed low levels of p24 antigen in 29% of cord blood sera, a postnatal increase to levels that were during the first 6 months of life inversely associated with survival, and persistence of antigenemia thereafter independent of clinical status. Prevalence and antigen levels were significantly lower in mothers. The persistent antigenemia in children indicates that their immune systems cannot restrict HIV expression as efficiently as those of adults."

However, the relationship between immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and occult HCV, characterized by the presence of HCV-RNA in liver or in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the absence of serological markers, is unknown. We tested this in 113 anti-HCV-negative patients; 87 with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and 26 controls with hereditary glomerular nephropathies. All patients were serum HCV-RNA negative by conventional real-time PCR. Significantly, occult HCV-RNA (detectable viral RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or in serum after ultracentrifugation) was found in 34 of 87 patients with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis versus 1 of 26 control patients. The serum creatinine levels were significantly higher in patients with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis with than in those without occult HCV (1.5 versus 1.1 mg/dl, respectively). A multivariate analysis adjusted for gender showed a significantly increased risk of occult HCV in patients with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis versus the controls (odds ratio of 13.29). Progression to end-stage renal disease tended to be faster in patients with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and occult HCV than in the negative cases. Thus, occult HCV is strongly associated with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and may have a role in the progression of the disease."

This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a Hospital for Tropical Diseases in the state of Goiás, Midwestern Brazil. Patients' medical records were reviewed between January 2008 and December 2009. Sixty-one cases of TB/HIV coinfection were evaluated, and 54 HIV-seronegative TB cases were selected as controls. The prevalence of TB HIV coinfected patients in 2008/2009 was 23%. Coinfection was more prevalent in men (75.4%), with a mean age of 37.1 years. Pulmonary disease (50.8%) was the most frequent clinical form of TB in coinfected patients, followed by disseminated disease (32.8%). Anaemia, malnutrition and low levels of CD4 T lymphocytes were found in about 80% of coinfected patients. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were the most common radiographic finding in coinfected patients (51.8%), and pulmonary cavitation was the rarest event (5.4%). The mortality rate was 2.8 times higher in the TB HIV coinfected group (39.3%) than in TB patients without HIV (18.5%).

Susceptible residents were vaccinated against HBV and their serological response to hepatitis B vaccination determined. From December 2002 to April 2003, five residents with acute hepatitis B infection were identified with an attack rate of 5.5% and a case fatality rate of 40%. Three other residents were identified as HBV surface antigen and e-antigen positive carrier. None of the nursing staff tested positive for acute HBV infection or HBV carriage. Diabetic patients who were exposed to a shared finger-stick device for blood sampling were 10.7 times more likely to contract an acute HBV infection (RR 10.7; 95% CI 1.3-91.3). Other potential risk factors were undergoing podiatric care and being exposed to the shared razor blade of the hairdresser. The transmission of the infection could be controlled by restricting the use of finger-stick capillary sampling devices to individual patients, assigning separate glucometers to individual patients and, implementation of standard infection-control recommendations like wearing gloves and performing hand hygiene by the nursing staff, assigning separate podiatric sets to individual patients. HBV vaccination of the residents with three doses of HBV vaccine has not induced a sufficient degree of protection.

7169,0.004,4.0,"Five hundred ninety students receiving primary care in a university health service were surveyed anonymously in 1985-86 to study their self-reported sexual behavior and knowledge and attitudes about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Most students (75%) were heterosexual; 3% were homosexual, 3% bisexual, and 15% had never been sexually active. Many students (32%) had greater than or equal to 2 sexual partners in the past year, but only 23% of these had changed their sexual practices because of concern about AIDS. Some students with high-risk sexual behavior were not very knowledgeable: among homosexual or bisexual men, those with greater than or equal to 6 recent sexual partners knew less than others (P less than 0.001). Overall, less knowledgeable students had more personal concerns about AIDS, favored limiting the social activities of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and favored screening for HIV-antibody; these associations between knowledge and attitudes were significant even when controlling for demographic characteristics and sexual behavior with multiple linear regression. The authors conclude that many students receiving primary care reported sexual behavior that could spread HIV, and that less knowledgeable students had particular concerns and attitudes about AIDS."

Starting from the HEPT and TIBO derivatives, more than 30 structurally different classes of compounds have been identified as NNRTIs, that is compounds that are specifically inhibitory to HIV-1 replication and targeted at the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Two NNRTIs (nevirapine and delavirdine) have been formally licensed for clinical use and several others are in preclinical or clinical development [thiocarboxanilide UC-781, HEPT derivative MKC-442, quinoxaline HBY 097 and DMP 266 (efavirenz)]. The NNRTIs interact with a specific 'pocket' site of HIV-1 RT that is closely associated with, but distinct from, the NRTI binding site. NNRTIs are notorious for rapidly eliciting resistance due to mutations of the amino acids surrounding the NNRTI-binding site. However, the emergence of resistant HIV strains can be circumvented if the NNRTIs, alone or in combination, are used from the start at sufficiently high concentrations. In vitro, this procedure has proved to 'knock-out' virus replication and to prevent resistance from arising. In vivo, various triple-drug combinations of NNRTIs (nevirapine, delavirdine or efavirenz) with NRTIs (AZT, 3TC, ddI or d4T) and/or PIs (indinavir or nelfinavir) have been shown to afford a durable anti-HIV activity, as reflected by both a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and increased CD4 T-lymphocyte counts."

Although multiple infections with the same or different parasites have been reported, simultaneous infections are rare. We present the case of a 35-year-old man who developed a co-infection with Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Strongyloides, simultaneously, the diagnosis being made after the judicious evaluation of a stool sample.

Nucleos/tide analogues (NUCs) and interferon alpha (IFNα), the current standard of care for chronic infection, aim at preventing progression of the disease to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and death. However, in contrast to the case of hepatitis C virus infection, in which novel antiviral drugs cure the vast majority of treated patients, in regard to HBV, cure is rare due to the unusual persistence of viral DNA in the form of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) within the nucleus of infected cells. Available therapies for HBV require lifelong treatment and surveillance, as reactivation frequently occurs following medication cessation and the occurrence of HCC is decreased but not eliminated, even after years of successful viral suppression. Progress has been made in the development of new therapeutics, and it is likely that only a combination of immune modulators, inhibitors of gene expression and replication and cccDNA-targeting drugs will eradicate chronic infection. This review aims to summarize the state of the art in HBV drug research highlighting those agents with the greatest potential for success based on in vitro as well as on data from clinical studies."
2708,0.004,4.0,"The process of transcriptional activation directed by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) was investigated by in vivo footprinting using ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction in a human epithelial cell line infected with human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6). Infection with both viruses induces a remarkable enhancement in LTR-mediated gene expression that correlates with a change in the pattern of protein binding to the downstream kappa B site of the enhancer region. In HHV-6 infected cells, this change in the genomic footprinting pattern is concomitant with the induction of specific enhancer-binding proteins in the nucleus. The similarity of these events to those detected in other previously investigated experimental systems suggests that the LTR enhancer region is the ultimate target for the induction of the HIV-1 transcriptional response upon stimuli acting through different upstream pathways."
8187,0.004,4.0,"We examined the prevalence and correlates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) risk behaviors in a large sample of severely mentally ill (SMI) patients. Risk levels were correlated with demographic factors, diagnosis, symptom severity, trauma history, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use disorder (SUD), and sexual orientation. SMI clients from urban and rural settings (N = 275) were assessed regarding HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, and hypothesized risk factors. Patients exhibited substantial levels of risky behavior, particularly sexual risk. Correlates of increased risk included SUD, trauma, male homosexual orientation, younger age, and symptom severity. Structural equation modeling identified SUD and sexual orientation as the primary determinants of both drug and sexual risk behavior. We conclude that specific illness related variables appear to have less impact on risk behavior among people with SMI than previously hypothesized. Substance abuse prevention and treatment may be the most effective means of reducing HIV risk in this population."
6473,0.004,4.0,"Starting from the observation that a number of consecutive patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) resulted positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies on routine testing, we set up a survey for HCV contact prevalence in all patients with lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) followed in our institution. We searched for HCV antibodies by a third-generation ELISA technique, followed by a confirmation test (RIBA III); serum viral RNA and HCV genotype were investigated by a RT-PCR technique. We screened a total of 315 patients suffering from B-NHL (91), multiple myeloma (56), MGUS (48), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (57), Waldentrom's macroglobulinemia (13), Hodgkin's disease (HD)(43), and T-NHL (9). While only 1 of 52 patients with a non-B-LPD (HD or T-NHL) had signs of HCV contact (i.e., 1.9%, which is in the range of the normal population in the South of Italy), 59 of 263 patients with a B-LPD (22.4%) had HCV antibodies or RNA, or both, with no major differences among the various types of disorders, except for WM, in which the rate was higher (61.5%). The same prevalence was found for patients tested at diagnosis or during the follow-up, and in transfused or never-transfused patients. Only a few patients were aware of having a liver disease; one-half of HCV-positive patients never had transaminase increase. A review of data from Central and Northern Italy is included, showing similar findings; a report from Japan has confirmed such an association, while limited surveys in England have not revealed any correlation. These findings may have important biological and clinical implications."
9120,0.004,4.0,"Directly observed therapy (DOT) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is commonly used in correctional settings; however, the efficacy of DOT for treating HIV infection has not been determined. We prospectively assessed adherence to antiretroviral therapy regimens among 31 HIV-infected prison inmates who were receiving >or=1 antiretrovirals via DOT. Adherence was measured by self-report, pill count, electronic monitoring caps, and, for DOT only, medication administration records. Overall, median adherence was 90%, as measured by pill count; 86%, by electronic monitoring caps; and 100%, by self-report. Adherence, as measured by electronic monitoring caps, was >90% in 32% of the subjects. In 91% of cases, adherence, as measured by medication administration records, was greater than that recorded by electronic monitoring caps for the same medications administered by DOT. Objective methods of measurement revealed that adherence to antiretroviral regimens administered wholly or in part by DOT was <or=90% in more than one-half of the patients. Different methods used to measure adherence revealed significantly different levels of adherence. These findings suggest that use of DOT does not ensure adherence to antiretroviral therapy."
3054,0.004,4.0,"HIV-1 gp120 is an immunoglobulin superantigen which can bind to preimmune serum Ig. We hypothesize that levels of such preimmune antibodies vary in the population and might affect host resistance or susceptibility to viral transmission. This study tests two predictions: (a) levels of preimmune anti-gpl20 Igs are a polymorphic trait; and, (b) these levels are correlated with resistance or susceptibility to HIV-1 transmission. The first prediction was confirmed in a longitudinal study of a low-risk seronegative population. In this group, levels of both endogenous anti-gpl20 IgM and IgG varied widely, but were characteristic and stable for each individual. The second prediction was addressed in a study of participants of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, in which men ""susceptible"" and ""resistant"" to HIV infection were identified based on numbers of sexual partners and eventual seroconversion. Specimens consisted of archival sera obtained > 2 yr before seroconversion. Men in the susceptible population (low-risk seroconverters) were distinguished by low levels of anti-gpl20 IgG. We conclude that the level of preimmune anti-gpl20 IgG is a polymorphic population trait, and low levels are a potentially specific and significant factor in homosexual transmission of HIV infection."
9061,0.004,4.0,"Evaluation of metabolic factors and elevated γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels as independent predictors of treatment failure in a thoroughly documented cohort of HIV-/HCV-coinfected patients (HIV/HCV). Sixty-four HIV/HCV patients treated with pegylated interferon-α-2a plus ribavirin (PEGIFN + RBV) at the Medical University of Vienna within a prospective trial were included in this study. In addition, 124 patients with HIV/HCV from the AIFA-HIV and AHIVCOS cohorts were included as a validation cohort. Advanced liver fibrosis, GGT elevation, insulin resistance (IR) and low CD4+ nadir were defined as METAVIR F3/F4, GGT levels >1.5× sex-specific upper limit of normal, homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance >2 and CD4+ nadir <350 cells/μL, respectively. HCV-genotype 1/4 (OR26.3; P = 0.006), advanced liver fibrosis (OR20.2; P = 0.009), interleukin 28B rs12979860 non-C/C SNP (OR8.27; P = 0.02) and GGT elevation (OR7.97; P = 0.012) were independent predictors of treatment failure, while both IR (OR3.51; P = 0.106) and low CD4 + nadir (OR2.64; P = 0.263) were not independently associated with treatment failure. A statistically significant correlation between GGT elevation and prior alcohol abuse (r = 0.259; P = 0.039), liver steatosis (r = 0.301; P = 0.034) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (r = -0.256; P = 0.041) was observed. The importance of GGT elevation as an independent predictor of treatment failure was confirmed in a validation cohort (OR2.76; P = 0.026). While GGT elevation emerged as an independent predictor of treatment failure in both the derivation and the validation cohort, no independent associations between metabolic factors and treatment failure were observed. Thus, our findings suggest that GGT elevation is an independent predictor of treatment failure in HIV/HCV that can easily be incorporated into predictive algorithms. "
2383,0.004,4.0,"We review studies examining the quality and quantity of social relationships as potential risk factors for differential progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Several well-conducted prospective studies suggest that the health effects associated with the presence of supportive social relationships vary according to disease stage and mode of transmission. For gay or bisexual males in the early stages of infection, the presence of supportive social relationships appears to be a risk factor for accelerated disease progression. For individuals in the later stages of infection and those who acquire HIV via intravenous drug use or transfusion, supportive social relationships appear to be associated with health protective effects similar to those observed in other disease settings. We consider a variety of potential explanations for accelerated disease progression in gay men with extensive networks of personal relationships."
5360,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major causes of viral hepatitis worldwide. Despite the prevalence of HBV infection in Egypt, few studies have focused on sub-genotyping of the virus. Moreover, no studies are available regarding the mutational analysis of the preS1/preS2 region of the viral genome, or its impact on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in Egypt. In this study, we have analyzed the sub-genotypes and incidence of mutations in the preS1/preS2 region of HBV present in HBV-infected patients, from Mansoura city (located in the center of Nile Delta region of Egypt), via partial sequencing of this specific region. Moreover, we have investigated the impact of these mutations on HCC development by measuring serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level and abdominal ultrasound examination of the HBV-infected patients. According to our results, all samples were genotype D in which sub-genotype D1 was predominant. In addition, the results revealed mutations in the preS1/preS2 region, which could result in either immature preS1 protein or completely inhibit the translation of the preS2 protein. However, there was no incidence of HCC development in patients infected with mutated HBV in the preS1/preS2 region. In summary, for the first time our work has proved the predominance of sub-genotype D1 among HBV-infected Egyptian patients in Mansoura city, Nile Delta region, Egypt, and incidence of mutations in the preS1/preS2 region of HBV genome. This current study opens up research opportunities to discuss the impact of HBV mutations on the development of HCC in Egypt."
4921,0.004,4.0,"The antiretroviral drug combination emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF/FTC) taken as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV infection, yet it also requires adherence and potentially decreases condom use. This study sought to examine these issues among a key population at risk of HIV infection, substance-using men who have sex with men (MSM). We conducted semi-structured interviews with an ethnically diverse sample of 30 young (aged 20-35) MSM prescribed PrEP within a large integrated healthcare system in San Francisco, who had reported recent drug use or hazardous drinking and one or more missed doses of PrEP. We explored participants' risk perception and sexual risk behavior, drug and alcohol use, and PrEP adherence in the context of substance use. Interviews were transcribed and coded using a directed content analysis approach to identify key categories and commonalities, and differences across participants. Salient subcategories included positive psychological effects of being on PrEP (e.g., decreased anxiety, feelings of empowerment), social effects (e.g., reduced HIV stigma), and reduction in overall perceptions of HIV risk. While overall reported use of condoms went down and many reported a brief period of increased condomless sex following PrEP initiation, others continued condom use with most of their sexual partners. Contextual factors influencing their decision to engage in condomless sex included how well they knew the partner and whether the partner was on PrEP or HIV antiretroviral treatment. Factors associated with poor adherence included disruptions in daily routine and use of alcohol and methamphetamine. PrEP-prescribing clinicians should support their patients in making informed decisions about condom use and identifying strategies to maximize adherence in the context of substance use."
1056,0.004,4.0,"An estimated 150-200 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C. Prevalence is higher in some countries in Asia and Africa. Only limited information about the epidemiology of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection especially in females is available. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies and the possible factors for transmission in the female population of a largely urban city Islamabad. A cross sectional study was conducted from May 2006 to August 2006 in Islamabad. We select 252 female households (n=252) following the selection criteria. The primary outcome variables were HCV seropositivity and factors like history of major surgical procedure, blood transfusion, Intravenous drug use etc. The results showed mean age of the sample was 33.21 (±9.95) years and HCV seropositivity was present in 62 (24.6%) females. Final Forward Stepwise multiple logistic regression showed blood transfusion [OR, 10.094 95% CI 1.950-52.257], dental procedure [OR, 5.381 95% CI 2.315-12.507] and dilation and curettage [OR, 3.869 95% 1.867-8.015] were significantly associated with HCV seropositivity in females.

1737,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are major causes of acute and chronic liver disease worldwide. Chronic infection with these viruses often leads to chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis or primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Both HBV and HCV are bloodborne viruses; however, HBV is transmitted efficiently by both percutaneous and mucosal exposures, and HCV is transmitted predominantly by percutaneous exposures. Because the relative importance of various modes of transmission of these viruses differs by country, the choice of specific prevention and control strategies depends primarily on the epidemiology of infection in a particular country. Comprehensive hepatitis B prevention strategies should include (1) prevention of perinatal HBV transmission, (2) hepatitis B vaccination at critical ages to interrupt transmission and (3) prevention of nosocomial HBV transmission. The prevention of hepatitis C is problematic because a vaccine to prevent HCV infection is not expected to be developed in the foreseeable future. From a global perspective, the greatest impact on the disease burden associated with HCV infection will most likely be achieved by focusing efforts on primary prevention strategies to reduce or eliminate the risk for transmission from nosocomial exposures (e.g. blood transfusion, unsafe injection practices) and high-risk practices (e.g. injecting drug use)."
9359,0.004,4.0,"The G-->A mutation of nucleotide (nt) 1896 in the precore region of hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevents production of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) by creating a TAG stop codon. This mutation is often found in anti-HBe-positive patients with productive HBV infection and has been associated with severe chronic and fulminant hepatitis in some geographic areas. Emergence of the TAG mutation during HBe seroconversion was studied as was its relationship with nt 1858, which forms a base pair with nt 1896 in the pregenomic RNA loop. A TAG mutant evolved in 18 (72%) of 25 patients with a T-1858 strain but in only 1 (8%) of 13 with a C-1858 strain. Viremia with C-1858 strains was, despite their limited ability to develop the TAG mutation, as persistent as with T-1858 strains. Generally, T-1858-infected patients in whom a TAG mutant did not emerge were HBV DNA-negative by polymerase chain reaction on follow-up, whereas patients who developed the TAG mutation had prolonged viremia."
8720,0.004,4.0,"One hundred thirty-four homosexual men from a prospective cohort study of AIDS risk from New York City and Washington D.C. and 139 homosexual men from a similar cohort in Copenhagen and Aarhus, Denmark were questioned regarding their sexual practices and knowledge of their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status over the previous 12 months. Seventy percent of Danish men and 63% of U.S. men participated in anal intercourse during the previous 12 months. Knowledge of one's own HIV status by itself did not have any significant effect on participation in anal intercourse, partner number, or condom use. Only 23% of U.S. men and 24% of Danish men always asked potential partners about their HIV status. However, men who did ask were very unlikely to choose a partner of opposite HIV status (p less than 0.006). Danish men were more likely to practice anal intercourse without a condom than were the U.S. men (p less than 0.0001); however, Danes were more likely to be in a concordant monogamous relationship than were the U.S. men (p less than 0.001). Fourteen percent of U.S. men and 21% of Danish men were not aware of their own HIV status and 52% of the U.S. cohort and 31% of the Danes had anal intercourse with a man whose status was unknown to them. Overall, only 32% of American and 53% of Danish homosexual men were practicing completely safe sex. We suggest that education to promote the need for awareness of one's own and one's partner's HIV status should be stressed."
7981,0.004,4.0,"We examined attitudinal and demographic correlates of antiretroviral acceptance and adherence among incarcerated HIV-infected women. Structured interviews were conducted with 102 HIV-infected female prisoners eligible for antiretroviral therapy. Three quarters of the women were currently taking antiretroviral agents, of whom 62% were adherent to therapy. Satisfaction was very high with the HIV care offered at the prison; 67% had been first offered antiretroviral agents while in prison. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed acceptance of the first offer of antiretroviral therapy to be associated with trust in medication safety, lower educational level, and non-black race. Current acceptance of therapy was associated with trust in the medication's efficacy and safety. Medication adherence was correlated with the patient-physician relationship and presence of emotional supports. Nearly one half of these HIV-seropositive women were willing to take experimental HIV medications in prison. This was correlated with satisfaction with existing health care, the presence of HIV-related social supports, and perceived susceptibility to a worsening condition. Acceptance and adherence with antiretroviral agents appear to be significantly associated with trust in medications, trust in the health care system, and interpersonal relationships with physicians and peers. Development of models of care that encourage and support such relationships is essential for improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy, especially for populations that have historically been marginalized from mainstream medical care systems."
9026,0.004,4.0,"Many HIV-infected women are not realizing the benefits of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) despite significant advancements in treatment. Women in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES) are highly marginalized and struggle with multiple morbidities, unstable housing, addiction, survival sex, and elevated risk of sexual and drug-related harms, including HIV infection. Although recent studies have identified the heightened risk of HIV infection among women engaged in sex work and injection drug use, the uptake of HIV care among this population has received little attention. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the needs of women engaged in survival sex work and to assess utilization and acceptance of HAART. During November 2003, a baseline needs assessment was conducted among 159 women through a low-threshold drop-in centre servicing street-level sex workers in Vancouver. Cross-sectional data were used to describe the sociodemographic characteristics, drug use patterns, HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing and status, and attitudes towards HAART. High rates of cocaine injection, heroin injection, and smokeable crack cocaine use reflect the vulnerable and chaotic nature of this population. Although preliminary findings suggest an overall high uptake of health and social services, there was limited attention to HIV care with only 9% of the women on HAART. Self-reported barriers to accessing treatment were largely attributed to misinformation and misconceptions about treatment. Given the acceptability of accessing HAART through community interventions and women specific services, this study highlights the potential to reach this highly marginalized group and provides valuable baseline information on a population that has remained largely outside consistent HIV care."
1796,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has emerged as a sexually transmitted infection among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in high-income countries. Little is reported about HCV awareness among MSM, although this is essential for developing targeted prevention strategies. We, therefore, studied HCV awareness and knowledge among HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS). During two visits, 1 year apart and starting in October 2007, MSM from the ACS answered questions regarding HCV awareness, knowledge of HCV transmission (7 items), complications (8 items) and sexual risk behaviour. We examined the percentage of HCV awareness and correctly answered knowledge items, and whether awareness and knowledge improved significantly over time. Using logistic regression, we studied whether HIV status and sexual risk behaviour were associated with awareness. Seventy percent (312/444) of HIV-negative and 80% (74/92) of HIV-positive MSM reported to have ever heard of HCV on the first visit. Overall, awareness increased with 9% between the first and second visit (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis the association of group sex with HCV awareness was borderline significant (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.97-2.30). Compared with knowledge of transmission routes, knowledge of complications appeared to be limited. In the ACS, awareness of HCV is high, particularly among those reporting group sex, an important risk factor for HCV transmission. The majority of participants had good knowledge of transmission routes, but limited knowledge of complications of chronic HCV infection. HCV prevention messages could be strengthened, therefore, by further addressing the complications of HCV infection. "
2362,0.004,4.0,"New human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) diagnoses are increasing rapidly in Hebei. The aim of this study presents the most extensive HIV-1 molecular epidemiology investigation in Hebei province in China thus far. We have carried out the most extensive systematic cross-sectional study based on newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive individuals in 2013, and characterized the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequences in the whole of Hebei. Nine HIV-1 genotypes based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequence were identified among 610 newly diagnosed naïve individuals. The four main genotypes were circulating recombinant form (CRF)01_AE (53.4%), CRF07_BC (23.4%), subtype B (15.9%), and unique recombinant forms URFs (4.9%). Within 1 year, three new genotypes (subtype A1, CRF55_01B, CRF65_cpx), unknown before in Hebei, were first found among men who have sex with men (MSM). All nine genotypes were identified in the sexually contracted HIV-1 population. Among 30 URFs, six recombinant patterns were revealed, including CRF01_AE/BC (40.0%), CRF01_AE/B (23.3%), B/C (16.7%), CRF01_AE/C (13.3%), CRF01_AE/B/A2 (3.3%) and CRF01_AE/BC/A2 (3.3%), plus two potential CRFs. This study elucidated the complicated characteristics of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology in a low HIV-1 prevalence northern province of China and revealed the high level of HIV-1 genetic diversity. All nine HIV-1 genotypes circulating in Hebei have spread out of their initial risk groups into the general population through sexual contact, especially through MSM. This highlights the urgency of HIV prevention and control in China."

However, whether combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) reverses or exacerbates hepatic fibrosis remains unclear.This was an observational retrospective study. cART-naïve HIV-infected subjects without a history of substance abuse (including alcohol) had liver disease stage determined by aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio indices (APRIs) and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) before and 24 and 48 weeks after cART. All the data were retrieved from previously established cohorts. Values before and after cART were compared using Wilcoxon test for paired samples. Regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with moderate-to-severe liver disease.Of the 1105 HIV-infected subjects, 120 were HBV coinfected and 64 were HCV coinfected. About 20% of HIV monoinfected participants had APRI and FIB-4 scores consistent with moderate-to-significant fibrosis compared to ∼36% of HIV-HBV coinfected and 67% to 77% of HIV-HCV coinfected participants. In adjusted analyses compared with HIV monoinfection, HBV coinfection was associated with 1.18-fold higher APRI (P < 0.001) and a 1.12-fold higher FIB-4 (P = 0.007) prior to cART; while HCV coinfection was associated with 1.94-fold higher APRI (P < 0.001) and a 1.43-fold higher FIB-4 (P < 0.001). After 48 weeks of cART, both fibrosis scores decreased in all subjects; however, HCV coinfection was still associated with higher fibrosis scores at week 48 compared to HIV monoinfection.cART was associated with improvement in hepatic fibrosis scores in the majority of HIV-hepatitis coinfected and HIV-monoinfected Chinese participants."
4120,0.004,4.0,"CD8+ T lymphocytes of HIV-1 infected individuals produce a soluble factor that efficiently suppresses HIV-1 replication at the transcriptional level. We show here that the response of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) to mitogenic or Tat-mediated activation is sensitive to the suppressive action of a Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)-transformed CD8+ T cell clone from an HIV-infected individual and supernatants from CD8+ T cells of HIV-1-infected asymptomatic subjects (CD4+ > 350/microliters). Mutagenesis of NF kappa B or Sp-1 elements within the LTR resulted in no change in the ability of CD8+ T cell supernatants to inhibit Tat- or mitogen-mediated LTR transcription. However, the response to HIV-1 Tat by a LTR in which the interleukin (IL)-2 homology NFAT-1 region was mutated resulted in almost complete elimination of suppression by CD8+ T cells. This was not observed when the NFAT-1 mutant LTR was activated by mitogen. We have previously shown that gene expression directed by the HIV-1 NF kappa B elements is inhibited by CD8+ cell-derived supernatants (Copeland et al., AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses, 1995;11:1321-1326). Taken together, these observations suggest that mitogenic activation, mediated primarily through the NF kappa B enhancer, is susceptible to CD8-mediated inhibition, however, inhibition of Tat-mediated activation may rely upon a different pathway that is NFAT-1 dependent."
3179,0.004,4.0,"The number of hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier babies has decreased markedly since the introduction in Japan of an ""at-risk"" strategy for preventing HBV infection. However, elimination of HBV infection from our country appears difficult. To clarify the limitations of the at-risk strategy for preventing vertical transmission of HBV, causes of vertical transmission in a single hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The following causes were presumed in 17 carrier pediatric cases: five patients had prenatal HBV infection, HBV infection during/after the immunization program was confirmed in five cases, two patients had prenatal infection or infection during the immunization program and three cases were caused by human error (by the patients' guardians). Because their mothers were HBV-negative at screening and only developed acute hepatitis B in the perinatal period, another two cases (Cases 3 and 10) did not undergo immunization because they were not subjects of the at-risk strategy. Sequence analyses in ten patients revealed genotype C (subgenotype, C2/Ce) in nine cases and genotype A (subgenotype, A2/Ae) in one case (Case 3). In Japan, HBV subgenotype Ae has recently been found more frequently among sexually active men with acute hepatitis. There are concerns that horizontal transmission of HBV from these men to their pregnant partners could increase. These data suggest clear limitations to the at-risk strategy in Japan and the possibility that the increase in genotype A may influence vertical transmission of HBV."
5842,0.004,4.0,"Egypt is confronted with the highest hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic. Apoptosis and cellular immune responses are crucial to the clearance or persistence of viral infections. This case-control study was carried out to detect whether apoptosis genes single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) confer risk to HCV in a cohort of Egyptian patients and to explore their association with viral load. One hundred and ninety six blood samples were withdrawn from 96 HCV patients and 100 controls. The Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) -1525G>A and FasL-844T>C SNPs were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Hepatitis C viral load was measured using Real time PCR. Results Genotypes distributions of TRAIL -1525G>A and FasL-844 T>C polymorphisms in controls were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05). The study showed a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the TRAIL -1525G>A polymorphism genotypes and the FasL-844 T>C polymorphism genotypes between the HCV patients and the controls (p=0.001 and 0.02 respectively), with association of the -1525GA genotype and -844 TT genotype with increased risk of HCV infection (OR=2.68, 1.942 respectively, 95% CI=1.482-4.846, 1.1-3.43, respectively). No significant association was detected between TRAIL, FasL and the viral load. Our results suggest that the FasL -844T>C SNP is implicated in the susceptibility to HCV in Egyptian patients and firstly report the involvement of TRAIL gene polymorphism in the risk of the disease. Therefore we recommend national programs to delineate genetic factors that may put individuals at risk for contracting HCV."

A cohort of 424 HIV-1 infected individuals were chosen as study subjects, and 836 HIV-negative healthy subjects from the same area served as the control population. HLA-A, B, and DRB1 allele typing was performed using polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP) and polymerase chain reaction-sequencing based typing (PCR-SBT) techniques. Arlequin ver3.0 was used to analyze the allele and haplotype frequencies of HLA-A, B, and DRB 1, whereas Epi Info 7 and SPSS18.0 was used to analyze the differences in the HLA alleles between the HIV-1 positive and HIV-1 negative groups. A*02:03, DRB1*01:01, and DRB1*15:01 alleles and their haplotypes as well as the HLA_Bw4-Bw6 hybrid showed a protective effect on HIV-1 infection. After adjusting for confounding factors such as age and sex, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that B*15:02G, DRB1*01:01, and DRB1*15:01 subtypes were the resistance genes of HIV-1 infection, while B*13:01 might increase susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. The correlation between A*02:06 and B*15:01G subtypes and HIV-1 susceptibility was independent of the age and sex of the host. This study demonstrated the influence of genetic factors in humans such as HLA polymorphism on individuals to resist HIV-1 infection. Association studies of HLA polymorphism, susceptibility/resistance to HIV-1 infection, and hosts' genetic background are of significant importance for research on HIV-1 pathogenesis and vaccine design."
1115,0.004,4.0,"Integration, an indispensable step for retrovirus replication, is executed by integrase (IN), which is expressed as a part of a Gag-Pol precursor. Although mechanistic detail of the IN-catalyzed integration reaction is well defined, numerous evidence have demonstrated that IN is involved in multiple steps of retrovirus replication other than integration. In this study, Huwe1, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, was identified as a new cellular interactor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IN. The interaction was mediated through the catalytic core domain of IN and a wide-range region of Huwe1. Interestingly, although depletion of Huwe1 in target cells did not affect the early phase of HIV-1 infection in a human T cell line, we found that infectivity of HIV-1 released from the Huwe1 knockdown cells was significantly augmented more than that of virus produced from control cells. The increase in infectivity occurred in proviral DNA synthesis. Further analysis revealed that Huwe1 interacted with HIV-1 Gag-Pol precursor protein through an IN domain. Our results suggest that Huwe1 in HIV-1 producer cells has a negative impact on early post-entry events during the next round of virus infection via association with an IN region of Gag-Pol."
1540,0.004,4.0,"Efficient assembly of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) was achieved by cotransfection of Huh7 cells with two plasmids: one to provide expression of the large, middle, and small envelope proteins of hepatitis B virus (HBV), the natural helper of HDV, and another to initiate replication of the HDV RNA genome. HDV released into the media was assayed for HDV RNA and HBV envelope proteins and characterized by rate-zonal sedimentation, immunoaffinity purification, electron microscopy, and the ability to infect primary human hepatocytes. Among the novel findings were that (i) immunostaining for delta antigen 6 days after infection with 300 genome equivalents (GE) per cell showed only 1% of cells as infected, but this was increased to 16% when 5% polyethylene glycol was present during infection; (ii) uninfected cells did not differ from infected cells in terms of albumin accumulation or the presence of E-cadherin at cell junctions; and (iii) sensitive quantitative real-time PCR assays detected HDV replication even when the multiplicity of infection was 0.2 GE/cell. In the future, this HDV assembly and infection system can be further developed to better understand the mechanisms shared by HBV and HDV for attachment and entry into host cells."
7476,0.004,4.0,"The realization that many persons with HIV/AIDS are subjected to multiple layers of stigmatization because they belong to socially deviant and disenfranchised groups (e.g., injection drug users, racial/ethnic and sexual minorities) accounts for an increasing interest in the phenomenon of stigma layering. The stigma associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) has also been conceptualized as layered. However, researchers have overlooked the fact that HCV adds a layer to the HIV stigma and vice versa. Qualitative interviews with 132 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were analyzed to explore how they experience the two layers of stigma. Most participants hierarchically ordered the stigmas associated with each disease and regarded HIV as the more stigmatizing of the two. A small number perceived HIV and HCV as equally stigmatizing. The impact of the hierarchical and nonhierarchical ordering of the two stigmas on coinfected patients' felt and enacted stigmatization is explored and implications for interventions are discussed."
7996,0.004,4.0,"The validity of self-report of drug use has been found to vary widely. Moreover, previous research has focused on samples of adults. In 1996-1998, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adolescents and high-risk, noninfected adolescents (n = 182) were recruited at 16 locations in 13 US cities into the Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and Health (REACH) project, to the authors' knowledge, the first national study of disease progression among HIV-positive adolescents who were infected through sexual behavior or injection drug use. Self-report of marijuana use was assessed through audio computer-assisted self-administered interviewing (ACASI). Urines were tested for marijuana at a certified laboratory by using the enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique. Conditional kappas for 2-, 5-, and 7-day self-reports were 0.57, 0.71, and 0.69, respectively. Maximum sensitivity was obtained from a combination of ACASI and urine drug testing. Contrary to previous studies, the data suggest that if a single evaluative instrument is to be used for prevalence, ACASI is more sensitive than urine drug testing for marijuana overall, but particularly for HIV-infected adolescents."
7959,0.004,4.0,"Worldwide, there are thousands of new cases of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection per day. The effectiveness of current combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is relative; to prioritize finding vaccines and/or cure-oriented initiatives should be reinforced because there is little room, if any, for procrastination. Basic and clinical findings on HIV-1 reservoirs suggest that disruption of virus latency is feasible. Because the goal is curing HIV-1 infection, we should be aware that the challenge is to eradicate the viruses of every single infected cell and consequently acting upon virus latency is necessary but not sufficient. The large majority of the virus reservoir, CD4(+) T lymphocytes, is readily accessible but other minor reservoirs, where ART does not diffuse, require innovative strategies. The situation closely resembles that currently faced in the treatment of cancer. Exploiting the fact that histone deacetylase inhibitors, mainly vorinostat, may disrupt the latency of HIV-1, we propose to supplement this effect with a programmed interference in the metabolic stress of infected cells. Metformin and chloroquine are cheap and accessible modulators of pro-survival mechanisms to which viruses are constantly confronted to generate alternative energy sources and maximize virus production. Metformin restrains the use of the usurped cellular biosynthetic machinery by viral genes and chloroquine contributes to death of infected cells. We suggest that the combination of vorinostat, chloroquine and metformin should be combined with ART to pursue viral eradication in infected cells."
4758,0.004,4.0,"The effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the treatment of HIV infection is usually measured by survival, CD4 lymphocyte counts, HIV-1 RNA viral load testing, and the occurrence of opportunistic infections. This pilot study sought to measure the impact of HAART treatments on a wide range of clinical outcomes and psychological variables in a sample of patients with advanced HIV infection. Seventy patients with advanced AIDS who were protease inhibitor naïve were started on HAART regimens. Patients were admitted to an AIDS inpatient unit of a long-term care facility that provides treatment and palliative care. All patients were diagnosed with AIDS, had CD4 cell counts below 300/cc(3), and had a projected survival of greater than one month. Patients were started on triple-drug HAART regimens with daily medical supervision and observation. In addition to standard clinical and laboratory markers, a series of observer-rated and self-report instruments were used to measure various physical and psychological factors (e.g., pain and symptom distress, psychological well-being, depression). Data were collected at baseline and after 1 and 3 months of HAART therapy. As expected, the CD4 count increased and viral load levels decreased significantly over the 3-month study period. In addition, patients improved significantly in body weight, and serum albumin and ferritin levels. The only psychosocial measure that improved significantly with treatment was depression. Ratings of pain intensity, physical and psychological symptom distress, and overall quality of life did not change. Of the 70 patients studied, 84.3% were still alive after the 3-month study period. Of these, 6 (8.6%) were discharged to community. However, 17 surviving patients (24.3%) had HAART regimens discontinued due to drug intolerance and 11 patients (15.7%) expired during the study period. While these data are preliminary, HAART regimens appear to have positive effects on CD4 count, HIV viral load, and several other measures of physical well-being in patients with advanced AIDS. Despite these improvements, the benefits of treatment on pain and symptom distress, and psychological well-being were less clear. In addition, treatment failure (mortality and intolerance) were not uncommon in this sample (40%). Further research is clearly necessary to better understand the benefits of HAART therapy in patients with advanced HIV infection."
7580,0.004,4.0,"The present study was designed to assess the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among hospital employees, who often contract the infection before the beginning of their employment, and to suggest a prevention strategy. The study population consisted of 2518 subjects working or studying at the two Hadassah University hospitals, on Mount Scopus and at Ein Kerem in Jerusalem. The total prevalence for anti-HBc positivity as an indicator for past or present HBV infection was 17.6%. Several variables, including country of birth, age, and duration of employment significantly affected the rate of anti-HBc positivity. The highest rates for anti-HBc+ were found in personnel of selected departments such as haemodialysis (31.8%), haematology/oncology (28.3%), and the blood bank (24.0%), after adjustment for country of birth, age, and sex. Specific occupations in the hospital were associated with an increased rate of anti-HBc positivity. Thus the highest rate of HBV infection (after adjustment for country of birth, age, and sex) was shown for housekeepers (32.4%) and departmental secretaries (23.6%), who take care of waste products containing blood, or who transfer vials containing blood to the hospital laboratories. By comparison, anti-HBc was positive in 17.2% of nurses, 15.6% of physicians, and only 7.8% of administrative clerks. Israel is a country of immigration, and anti-HBc rates were four times higher in employees born in countries where HBV is more endemic--for example, in north Africa and Mediterranean countries--than in employees born in western Europe or the United States. However, rate of anti-HBc + increased significantly with age as well as duration of employment in the hospital, irrespective of country of birth. These data indicate that although HBV infection often occurs in Israel before commencement of employment in the hospital, hospital employees are at significant risk for contracting HBV infection during their professional lifetime regardless of where they were born. Moreover, paramedical personnel such as housekeepers and departmental secretaries are in the highest risk group for contracting HBV. Finally, as a result of the high background of anti-HBC positivity in selected ethnic groups, mandatory screening for anti-HBc before employment in medical institutions in Israel is recommended for them, then active vaccination against HBV for employees at risk. Employees who immigrated from western Europe and the United States should be immunised without pre-vaccination screening for HBV."
7231,0.004,4.0,"Recent genome-wide association studies report that the SNP rs8099917, located 8.9 kb upstream of the start codon of IL28B, is associated with both disease chronicity and therapeutic response to pegIFN-α and RBV in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. To determine the effect of rs8099917 variation on the response of HCV to therapy, we genotyped this variant in a cohort of 160 HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients in our clinic unit who received combined peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy. The rs8099917 T/G or G/G genotypes were observed in 56 patients (35%). Treatment failure occurred in 80% of G-allele carriers versus 48% of non-carriers (P<0.0001). This result reveals that the G allele was strongly associated with treatment failure in this patient cohort. Importantly, a highly significant association was found between the G-allele and response to therapy in HCV genotype 1-infected patients (P<0.0001) but not in HCV genotype 3-infected patients. Multivariate analysis (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval; P value) indicated that the rs8099917 TT genotype was a strong predictor of treatment success (5.83; 1.26-26.92; P = 0.021), independent of baseline plasma HCV-RNA load less than 500 000 IU/ml (4.85; 1.18-19.95; P = 0.025) and absence of advanced liver fibrosis (5.24; 1.20-22.91; P = 0.025). These results reveal the high prevalence of the rs8099917 G allele in HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients as well as its strong association with treatment failure in HCV genotype 1-infected patients. rs8099917 SNP genotyping may be a valid pre-treatment predictor of which patients are likely to respond to treatment in this group of difficult-to-treat HCV/HIV-infected patients."
4656,0.004,4.0,"The interaction of viral and host factors is believed to determine not only the risk for initial human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) acquisition but also the course of the infection. Genetic polymorphisms in the chemokine receptors and their ligands were related to the susceptibility and resistance to HIV-1 infection. A polymorphism in the conserved 3' untranslated region of the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF1) gene, which encodes a ligand of the CXCR4 receptor, has been related either to delayed progression to AIDS or to rapid disease progression and death. Global, regional, and ethnic distributions of frequencies of SDF1 genotypes and of the SDF1-3'A allele vary significantly. Although the HIV-1 epidemic is increasing in Brazil, little information about the frequencies of host genetic mutations related to HIV/AIDS resistance in the Brazilian population has been reported. To address this question, this study was carried out in order to determine the frequencies of the SDF1 polymorphism and the SDF1-3'A allele on 1061 genomic DNA samples purified from peripheral blood cells of 136 healthy individuals (group 1), 147 HIV-1-exposed seronegative individuals (group 2), 161 HIV-1-infected asymptomatic individuals and with CD4(+) T-cells count 350 mm(-3) (group 3), and 617 HIV-1-infected individuals with AIDS and/or CD4(+) T-cells count < 350 mm(-3) (group 4). The frequencies of the SDF1-3'A homozygous mutation were 3.7%, 6.1%, 4.3%, and 5.3% among groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (P = 0.5120). The overall frequency of the SDF1-3'A allele was 0. 1984 and did not differ among the four groups (P = 0.2744). The results underscore the global distribution of the SDF1 polymorphism and the hypothesis that the SDF1-3'A allele, itself, may not be sufficient to prevent the risk of HIV-1 infection and may be not related to the progression of the disease in the Brazilian population."
4848,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B vaccination programs have prevented infection in many dialysis patients, although the antibody response to vaccination is still insufficient in approximately 50%. Reinfection or reactivation of latent hepatitis B infection (HBV) has been reported in certain groups of immunosuppressed patients, including those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). We report the reactivation or reinfection of HBV with resurgence of hepatitis B surface antigen in a dialysis patient coinfected with HIV-1. Thus, in dialysis patients with latent HBV infection, with undetectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels, the potential exists to reactivate during immunosuppression associated with HIV-1 infection and/or end-stage renal disease. Reinfection with a different subtype is also possible. The development of hepatitis B surface antigenemia in this patient population creates a potential for transmission in the dialysis setting. This is of special concern since the number of patients infected with HIV-1 and with evidence of prior hepatitis B infection is increasing in urban units."
5998,0.004,4.0,"To define factors predictive of failure to respond to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-infected subjects pretreated with zidovudine (ZDV), three groups of subjects shifted to double therapy with ZDV plus didanosine (ddI, n = 13), zalcitabine (ddC, n = 14), or lamivudine (3TC, n = 12) were retrospectively evaluated, with respect to addition of the second NRTI, at week 0 and week 24. Factors considered included duration of ZDV pretreatment, CD4+ cell counts, plasma HIV-1 RNA load, peripheral blood mononuclear cell HIV-1 DNA load, and HIV-1 DNA genotypic resistance to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. The three groups were well matched for baseline characteristics and did not differ significantly in virological and immunological response to the different combination treatments. Drug-specific resistance mutations were selected in more than half the cases by 3TC, but not by ddI and ddC. Low-level and substantial genotypic resistance to ZDV was detected 13 (33.3%) and in 19 (48.7%) patients at baseline, respectively, and evolved through week 24 in several patients. When subjects were divided into responders and nonresponders to the second nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor on the basis of a decrease of more than 0.5 log10 (n = 15) or less than 0.5 log10 (n = 21) in HIV-1 RNA, respectively, baseline genotypic ZDV resistance was the only independent predictor of failure in a logistic regression model (P = 0.003 or P = 0.024, depending on whether low-level resistance was considered or not, respectively). Thus, selection of ZDV resistance mutations may impair subsequent use of different nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor compounds."
3228,0.004,4.0,"To our knowledge, the epidemiology of hospital-acquired infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients during long-term care has not been reported. For 13 months, we observed HIV-infected patients (50 men and 15 women) in a dedicated 21-bed unit in a long-term-care facility to determine the rate of nosocomial infections. The mean age of the patients was 39 years (range, 22-78 years); 74% of the patients had CD4 cell counts of < 200/mm3. There was a total of 152 infections (24 infections per 1,000 long-term-care days). The factors associated with the occurrence of a nosocomial infection were low CD4 cell counts, poor functional status, and longer duration of stays at the facility. The three most common infections were Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, primary bacteremia, and urinary tract infection. Eighteen hospital-manifested opportunistic infections occurred. More than 50% of the cases of bacteremia were due to multidrug-resistant organisms. Nosocomial infections occur commonly in HIV-infected patients in long-term care and thus are important considerations in patient management."
9292,0.004,4.0,"To investigate the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) among individuals with recent HIV-1 infection between February 2004 and January 2010 in a rural clinical cohort, samples from 72 participants were analyzed. Results from the 72 participants showed no protease inhibitor and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated mutations. One participant (1.4%, 95% CI: 0.04-7.5%) had two nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations (G190E and P225H). HIV-1 subtype frequencies were A 22 (30.6%), D 38 (52.8%), and C 1 (1.4%); 11 (15.3%) were A/D unique recombinant forms. Seven years after the scale up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a rural clinical cohort in Uganda, the prevalence of TDR among recently HIV-1-infected individuals was low at 1.4%. Since our findings from an HIV study cohort may not be generalizable to the general population, routine TDR surveys in specific populations may be necessary to inform policy on the magnitude and prevention strategies of TDR."

More recently, PRT inhibitors have provided new approaches in the treatment of HIV infection and AIDS. Impressive clinical results have been obtained with combination therapies of three ARV drugs, including one PRT inhibitor.

7183,0.004,4.0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been shown to induce a major and durable viral load reduction accompanied by a stable CD4 increase. This process may evolve with adverse clinical phenomena, known as the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). In the HIV population, non-tuberculous mycobacteria are a common cause of IRIS. However, only a few cases of Mycobacterium xenopi associated IRIS have been described. This paper concerns a case of M. xenopi pulmonary infection resulting in self-limited immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in an HIV-1 infected patient."
8691,0.004,4.0,"Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is the main therapeutic management tool for HIV/AIDS. Despite its success in controlling viral load and disease progression, cART is expensive, associated with a range of significant side effects and depends for its efficacy on the patient's life-long commitment to high levels of treatment adherence. Immunotherapeutic agents can provide potential solutions to these shortcomings. Here we describe a Phase Ib trial of HIV-v, a synthetic immunotherapy that elicits T- and B-cell effector responses against HIV infected cells."
8556,0.004,4.0,"In this study, the polymorphisms in the FAS and FASL genes was investigated in a sample of 198 HIV-1-seropositive individuals and 191 seronegative controls to evaluate a possible association between polymorphisms and the infection. The identification of the A and G alleles of the FAS -670 polymorphism was accomplished through polymerase chain reaction assays followed by digestion with the restriction enzyme MvaI. The identification of the A and G alleles of the FAS -124 polymorphism and the T and delT alleles of the FAS -169 polymorphism were performed using the amplification-created restriction site method followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism reactions. The comparative analysis of allelic and genotypic frequencies between the groups did not reveal any significant differences. However, the quantitative analysis of CD4(+) T lymphocytes suggests that the G allele of the FAS -670 A/G polymorphism can be a protective factor against the depletion of these cells in the course of an HIV-1 infection. Polymorphisms in the FAS and FASL genes were not associated with the number of CD8(+) T lymphocytes or the plasma viral load. Our findings suggest that the FAS -670 polymorphism may be associated with apoptosis of CD4(+) T lymphocytes after infection by HIV-1. "

8806,0.004,4.0,"This study focused on dietary glycemic index because insulin resistance can be important in the pathogenesis of fat deposition in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We evaluated differences in past dietary glycemic intake between men with HIV who developed fat deposition and those who did not. This was a nested case-control study consisting of 37 cases and 37 controls from the Nutrition for Healthy Living cohort. Food records from 6 to 24 months prior to development of fat deposition in cases were analyzed and compared with controls. Cases were defined as men with a waist-to-hip ratio >0.95 and body mass index (calculated as kg/m(2)) between 23 and 26. Controls were matched by age, race, body mass index, highly active antiretroviral therapy use, and CD4 count. Food records were analyzed using t tests for normally distributed nutrients and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for nutrients with skewed distributions. Glycemic index was calculated for each meal and day. There was no significant difference in glycemic index for meals and day between participants with or without fat deposition. Both groups had a moderate dietary glycemic index intake. This study showed no association between dietary glycemic index and development of fat deposition in HIV. Instead, results of this study depict the potential benefits associated with eating high-quality diets, primarily adequate fiber and protein intake. Diet can be important in preventing development of fat deposition in patients with HIV."
4732,0.004,4.0,"Coinfections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV are very frequent. Although HBV is a DNA virus, it replicates via reverse transcription like HIV. Structural similarities between the enzymatic pocket of the HBV DNA polymerase and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase are the basis that certain drugs inhibit both enzymes and thus the replication of both viruses. HBV components increase the pathogenic action of HIV and vice versa directly by certain proteins like HBsAg in the case of HBV and HIV-encoded Tat and Vpr and by disturbing the cytokine balance in affected cells. Antiretroviral therapy is highly beneficial for HIV/HBV-coinfected patients, but carries the risk of drug-induced resistance development and hepatotoxicity. Even with restoration of the immune capacity, signs of hepatic inflammation may develop even after 10 years of treatment."
889,0.004,4.0,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ genetic polymorphisms have been associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) outcomes. We aimed to determine impacts of HLA-DQ polymorphisms and their interactions with HBV mutations on the risks of liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). rs2856718 (A>G) and rs9275319 (A>G) were genotyped in 1342 healthy controls, 327 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance subjects, 611 asymptomatic HBsAg carriers (ASCs), 1144 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 734 LC patients, and 1531 HCC patients using quantitative PCR. HBV mutations were detected by direct sequencing. Logistic regression analyses were utilized to assess the factors and/or multiplicative interactions significantly associated with liver diseases. rs9275319 variant genotypes were inversely associated with HBV persistence compared to HBV natural clearance subjects. rs2856718 variant genotypes significantly increased LC risk compared to ASCs plus CHB patients (GG vs. AA: odds ratio [OR], 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.97 and AG+GG vs. AA: OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04-1.54) and decreased HCC risk compared to HCC-free HBV-infected subjects (AG vs. AA: OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.89 and AG+GG vs. AA: OR, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.68-0.90). rs2856718 variant genotypes were significantly associated with an increased frequency of HBV A1726C mutation, a LC-risk, HCC-protective mutation, in genotype C. A rs9275319 variant genotype (GG) was significantly associated with an increased frequency of preS1 start codon mutation, an HCC-risk mutation, in genotype C. The interaction of rs2856718 AG+GG genotype with T1753V, a HCC-risk mutation, significantly reduced LC risk, with an OR of 0.26 (95% CI, 0.09-0.78); whereas the interaction of rs2856718 AG genotype with C1673T, a LC-risk mutation, significantly increased HCC risk, with an OR of 2.80 (95% CI, 1.02-7.66) in genotype C HBV-infected subjects. Conclusively, the HLA-DQ polymorphisms affect the risks of LC and HCC differently in chronic HBV-infected subjects, possibly via interacting with the HBV mutations. "
4288,0.004,4.0,"Clinical and subclinical mastitis increase the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 through breastfeeding. We hypothesized that a field test for mastitis used for bovine milk, the California Mastitis Test, would detect high cell counts in milk of HIV-infected women. We also investigated whether total milk cell count would positively correlate with viral HIV-1 RNA in the milk of 128 HIV-positive Zambian women. Mean cell counts in each California Mastitis Test scoring category were significantly different (p < 0.01, n = 232). In a subset of 4-month postpartum milk samples tested for HIV-1 RNA, viral RNA levels did not significantly correlate with total cell count (r = 0.166, p = .244). The CMT may serve as a screening tool for mastitis in breastmilk, but total cell count does not correlate with HIV-1 RNA levels. Since both cell-free and cell-associated virus are associated with increased risk of MTCT, investigation of the relationship between total milk cell count and HIV-1 proviral DNA is warranted before a conclusive determination is made regarding use of the CMT as a clinical screening tool to detect cases at high risk for breastmilk transmission."
741,0.004,4.0,"Despite disproportionate rates of HIV among transgender women and evidence that medication adherence is necessary for treatment success and increased likelihood of survival, there has been little investigation into antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence issues among transgender women. This study examined rates of self-reported ART adherence among transgender women on ART (n = 35) and well-established correlates of nonadherence, including depression, adherence self-efficacy, patient perceptions of interactions with their providers, and perceived adverse side effects of ART compared to other respondents (n = 2,770). Transgender women on ART were less likely to report 90% adherence rates or higher and reported less confidence in their abilities to integrate treatment regimens into their daily lives. When transgender women were compared to other respondents, regardless of the current medication regimen, they reported significantly fewer positive interactions with their health care providers. Training for providers and integration of hormone therapy into HIV care is recommended."

5563,0.004,4.0,"The progress in treatment against hepatitis B virus (HBV) has substantially improved the outcome of all HBV-infected patients. We systematically reviewed the existing data in the management of HBV transplant patients in order to assess the optimal regimen in the pretransplant setting, for post-transplant prophylaxis and for therapy of HBV recurrent infection. All data suggest that an effective pretransplant anti-HBV therapy prevents post-transplant HBV recurrence. Pretransplant therapy has been based on lamivudine with addition of adefovir upon lamivudine resistance, but the use of newer, potent high-genetic barrier agents is expected to improve long-term efficacy. Moreover, it may lead to improvement of liver function, which sometimes removes the need for transplantation, although more objective criteria for removal from waiting lists are required. After liver transplantation, the combination of HBV immunoglobulin and one nucleos(t)ide analogue, mostly lamivudine, is currently the best approach, almost eliminating the probability of HBV recurrence. Treatment of post-transplant HBV recurrence has been mainly studied with lamivudine, but it will be most effective with entecavir and tenofovir, which have a low risk of resistance. In conclusion, the newer anti-HBV agents improve the treatment of HBV both pretransplant and post-transplant. HBV immunoglobulin is still used in combination with an anti-HBV agent for post-transplant prophylaxis. Monoprophylaxis with one of the new anti-HBV agents might be possible, particularly in patients preselected as having a low risk of HBV recurrence, but further data are needed and strategies to ensure compliance must be used."
5981,0.004,4.0,"Healthcare workers are at risk of occupationally-acquired viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV). HCV is parenterally transmitted and has been found in every part of the world. This cross-sectional study was conducted to establish the awareness and attitude about HCV infections among 210 full-time and part-time nursing students of the Medical College in Bitola, Macedonia from May to June 2009. For this purpose we used a self-administered questionnaire which consisted of three parts. The first included demographic data, the second included questions about causes of infection, mode of transmission, symptoms, acute and chronic hepatitis, and prevention, and the third questions about students' attitude toward patients with suspect or confirmed HCV infection. Full-time students showed higher HCV awareness (84 %) than part-time students (69 %). 58 % of the full-time and 79 % of the part-time students said they would not avoid professional contact with suspect or HCV infected patients. Our study has shown that even though both groups of students have a sufficient knowledge about HCV to face future challenges, they need further education on the subject. Practical recommendations would help to reduce stigmatising behaviour still further."
1511,0.004,4.0,"With the increasing availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy, vertically infected children have a better chance of surviving into adolescence and adulthood. Additionally, sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a problem, and incidence and prevalence among youth remain high. Therefore, HIV-infected adolescents are becoming a more prominent sub-group in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Experience from the developed world indicates that providing effective care and treatment for adolescents poses unique challenges. This study aimed to identify the experiences and needs of adolescents growing up in care or on treatment for HIV in Cape Town, South Africa. Four focus groups interviews were conducted with a total of 26 young people attending an adolescent infectious diseases clinic at a tertiary hospital. Questions explored participant's perceptions on their present and future lives, and their self-identified needs. Focus groups revealed that adolescents viewed their illness negatively, but that social issues such as violence and poverty were also concerns. Despite these stressors, most respondents remained positive about the present and future, and wanted support for achieving their goals. As increasing numbers of HIV-infected children enter adolescence, healthcare providers and communities must find ways to support these young people to transition into adulthood."
1475,0.004,4.0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has considerably improved the prognosis of HIV-infected patients. However, prolonged use of HAART has been related to long-term adverse events that can compromise patient health such as HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There is consistent evidence for a central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in these pathologies. Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) have been described to be mainly responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction in adipose tissue and liver although nonnucleoside transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs) have also showed mitochondrial toxicity, which is a major concern for the selection and the long-term adherence to a particular therapy. Several mechanisms explain these deleterious effects of HAART on mitochondria, and evidence points to other mechanisms beyond the ""Pol- γ hypothesis."" HIV infection has also direct effects on mitochondria. In addition to the negative effects described for HIV itself and/or HAART on mitochondria, HIV-infected patients are more prone to develop a premature aging and, therefore, to present an increased oxidative state that could lead to the development of these metabolic disturbances observed in HIV-infected patients.

The aim of this study was to identify epidemiological patterns and risk factors of HBV and HDV infections in Barcelos, in the basin of the Negro river. A random sample (798 in all) of the total population in the urban area and in 2 rural villages was surveyed. A standardized questionnaire was used and blood samples were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: 1.63% had hepatitis B surface antigen, 12.9% had anti-hepatitis B surface antibody and 21.4% had anti-hepatitis B core antigen. The overall prevalence of HBV infection was 24.6%. Anti-hepatitis D was present in 5 subjects, all of them non-natives, and hepatitis B e antigen in 2. A positive association between history of dental treatment with an unqualified dental surgeon was found (P < 0.05). These results suggest a low prevalence of HVB and HDV infection, in contrast with other parts of the Amazon area."
2611,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis virus coinfections [HBV plus HCV coinfection (HBV/HCV) or HBV plus HDV coinfection (HBV/HDV)] may progress more rapidly to cirrhosis than hepatitis B or C monoinfections in immunocompetent patients. Only limited information is available on the outcome of coinfected patients after liver transplantation. We studied survival rates of 204 patients with viral hepatitis transplanted at our center between 1972 and 1997. HBV/HDV and HBV/HCV coinfections were present in 23 and nine individuals, respectively, while 97 patients had monoinfection by HCV and 75 had HBV monoinfection. Survival of coinfected patients was significantly longer than that of monoinfected patients (14.4 +/- 0.9 vs. 8.5 +/- 0.6 yr; p = 0.0003). The same was true for graft survival (p = 0.0002). In Cox's regression, viral coinfection (p = 0.0001), absence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (p = 0.00001) and no retransplantation (p = 0.02) were independently associated with patient survival. After exclusion of patients with HCC (n = 62), survival of coinfected patients was still significantly longer than that of monoinfected individuals (p = 0.002). The improved outcome was similar for both HBV/HDV and HBV/HCV coinfections. In contrast to immunocompetent patients, individuals with multiple hepatitis virus infections had an improved outcome after liver transplantation. Thus, viral coinfections may be associated with ameliorated courses of diseases under certain conditions."
5464,0.004,4.0,"DNA sequences encoding the C2 to V3 region of envelope glycoprotein gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were amplified by PCR from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 24 of 25 HIV-1-seropositive patients from Cyprus. By using a heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA), all amplified products were studied genetically and compared with 16 previously characterized HIV-1 strains belonging to subtypes A through F. HMA results revealed that HIV-1 gp120 sequences from 15 of our patients were of subtype B of HIV-1, whereas one isolate was of subtype C. However, gp120 sequences from eight patients had no obvious similarities to the known subtypes as defined by HMA. DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of molecular clones confirmed the HMA results and placed the eight undefined HIV-1 isolates into three distinct genetic clusters. On the basis of branch topology and lengths of the phylogenetic tree, we conclude that one group consisting of three clones from two patients represents a new HIV-1 env subtype, which we have termed subtype I. The remaining two sequence clusters, consisting of five sequences from four patients and two sequences from two other patients, are distally related to subtypes A and F. These data demonstrate the extensive heterogeneity of HIV-1 in Cyprus, including the presence of new subtype."
4485,0.004,4.0,"We examined psychiatric correlates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a major risk group for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, men with hemophilia. A central goal was to identify psychosocial factors associated with increased vulnerability to psychiatric distress after infection with HIV. Seventy-five hemophiliacs, 31 of whom were HIV seropositive (HIV+), were studied. The HIV+ men had elevated depression, anxiety, and anger-hostility symptom scores relative to those of men who were seronegative for HIV. There were no additional symptom differences among men according to infection stage or clinical severity of hemophilia. Men with any of eight psychosocial characteristics were particularly susceptible to effects of infection on mental health: a personal history of psychiatric distress before HIV diagnosis; familial psychiatric history; a high school education or less; low social support from one's wife; low family support; low friend support; a poor sense of mastery over one's life; and experiencing recent life events involving loss. The HIV+ men with one or more such characteristics were highly symptomatic; remaining HIV+ men had significantly lower symptom levels, similar to the low levels noted in the men seronegative for HIV. The findings provide initial empiric support for the notion that clinical services to alleviate emotional distress should be targeted to intervene on HIV+ persons' psychosocial assets and liabilities."

We retrospectively evaluated the impact of IL28B SNPs and other factors on SVR in a cohort of 102 HIV-1/HCV-coinfected patients treated with pegylated interferon-? (peg-INF?) and ribavirin. Data on baseline features and virological response at different time-points were collected. Overall, 89/102 patients (87%) were males, 44 (43%) of whom infected with HCV genotype 1; SVR was achieved by 50 patients (49%). A univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that rs129679860 SNP genotype CC (p<0.034), rs8099917 SNP genotype TT (p<0.01), HCV genotype 2 or 3 (p<0.0001), low HCV viral load (p<0.028) and RVR (rapid virological response) (p<0.0001) were associated with a higher likelihood of SVR. Multivariate analysis confirmed only RVR and HCV genotype as independent predictors of SVR. In a real life setting, the importance of RVR and IL28B SNPs was confirmed as predictive of SVR to identify patients with a higher likelihood of SVR to Peg-INF?+RBV, and also to designate a deferred therapy for patients with a low likelihood of SVR for whom it is preferable to wait for more successful options.

9104,0.004,4.0,"Monocytes and brain macrophage-microglial cells are thought to play a crucial role in the neurologic dysfunction associated with HIV-1 disease. Since neopterin is produced by monocytes-macrophages, we asked whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neopterin levels increase before the onset of HIV-1 neurologic disease and whether they correlate with other CSF and peripheral blood immunologic parameters. In this study, CSF neopterin levels from 159 neurologically asymptomatic HIV-positive persons were found to increase as the blood CD4+ T-cell count decreased and as CSF IgG, IgG synthesis, IgG index, and beta 2-microglobulin increased. Neopterin levels in the CSF exceeded those in the serum in 32% of patients, while 25% had CSF levels > 13.5 nmol/liter. CSF neopterin levels vary with immune status, may reflect intrathecal production, and can be elevated in asymptomatic HIV-positive patients with normal neurologic examinations. Long-term follow-up of this patient population should be able to define the clinical correlation between CSF neopterin levels during the asymptomatic phase of HIV-1 disease and the risk of subsequent neurologic disease."
2732,0.004,4.0,"In order to assess the adequacy of learning about the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in vocational training for general practice, a postal questionnaire survey was carried out among trainers and their trainees in seven health regions of England and Scotland. A total of 616 trainers (62%) and 538 trainees (58%) responded to the questionnaire asking about their knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding HIV and AIDS. Trainees' principal difficulties with HIV and AIDS resembled those of general practitioners currently in practice. More than 60% of trainees lacked knowledge about HIV and AIDS in babies, 50% would not accept intravenous drug misusers onto their list, only 12% found it easy to discuss sex with homosexual male patients, and only 37% felt able to offer counselling about HIV and AIDS. Trainees who had had a tutorial on HIV and AIDS as part of vocational training were significantly more knowledgeable than the remainder (P less than 0.01). In addition, trainees who found workshops on HIV and AIDS useful were more willing than others to take on drug misusers (P less than 0.05) and more confident in their ability to counsel patients with HIV infection (P less than 0.01). No significant associations were found between the trainers' own knowledge, attitudes and skills regarding HIV and AIDS and those of their trainees. It is concluded that there is a need to improve teaching about HIV and AIDS in vocational training for general practice. All general practitioner trainees should receive a tutorial to update their knowledge about HIV and AIDS, and attend a suitable workshop to challenge unfavourable attitudes and improve confidence in counselling."
4820,0.004,4.0,"4000 sera were tested for antibodies against hepatitis C virus (HCV) by means of an ELISA using the C100-3 antigen. 38.9% of patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis following blood transfusion (n = 108) had HCV antibodies. Among patients with chronic liver damage of unknown origin (n = 316) 30.4% were anti-HCV positive, and in 2,506 patients with transitional or chronic elevation of transaminases 14.8% showed HCV antibodies. Haemophiliacs (n = 26) with 65.4% anti-HCV positives and drug addicts (n = 46) with 56.5% anti-HCV positives had the highest prevalence among high risk groups. Addicts dying from drug abuse (n = 216) and HIV 1 positives (n = 127) were anti-HCV positive in 37.5% and 26.0%, respectively. Patients on haemodialysis (n = 331) had antibodies against HCV in 12.4%. Health care workers (n = 217) appear to be at a comparably low risk with only 2.8% anti-HCV positives. Up to now we could not find a single case of intrafamilial spread of HCV in 46 examined cases. We suggest that HCV infectivity of contaminated body fluids and blood is lower than that of hepatitis B virus or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 carriers. In suspected non-A, non-B hepatitis negative test results should be confirmed in a second sample because it may take three to six months after infection before HCV antibodies occur. However, about 10% of chronic HCV infections are not detectable with the presently available test. This may change when new tests become available using HCV specific antigens other than C100-3."

4465,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver diseases have contributed to increased morbidity and mortality in HIV-1-infected individuals in the era of effective antiretroviral therapy. HCV transmission patterns have changed among the HIV co-infected population during the last decade, with acute HCV infection emerging worldwide. HIV infection accelerates the progression of HCV-related liver diseases and consequently cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the current standard treatment of HCV infection with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin results in only a limited viral response. Furthermore, cumbersome pill regimens, antiretroviral related hepatotoxicity, and drug interactions of HCV and HIV regimens complicate therapy strategies. Fortunately, in the near future, new direct-acting anti-HCV agents will widen therapeutic options for HCV/HIV co-infection. Liver transplantation is also gradually accepted as a therapeutic option for end stage liver disease of HCV/HIV co-infected patients. "

7086,0.003,3.0,"Hodgkin's lymphoma is the most common non-AIDS-defining tumor diagnosed in HIV-infected patients. Although the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) led to a decreased incidence of several malignancies among HIV-infected patients, the incidence of HIV-associated Hodgkin's lymphoma (HIV-HL) has been persistent in recent years. Its unusually aggressive tumor behavior includes a higher frequency of unfavorable histologic subtypes, high stage and extranodal involvement by the time of presentation and poor therapeutic outcome, in comparison with Hodgkin's lymphoma outside the HIV setting. Treatment of HIV-HL is challenging considering the underlying immunodeficiency caused by HIV itself and may increase the risk of opportunistic infections by inducing further immunosuppression. To address this delicate vulnerability of the HIV-infected host, tailored regimens, which are less aggressive than standard regimens for HIV-negative hosts, have been applied to achieve tumor control. The introduction of HAART has opened a new perspective in the treatment of HIV-associated malignancies. The improved control of HIV infection and the subsequently improved survival rates of HIV-infected patients has changed the goal from tumor control to cure and new treatment approaches with more potent regimens need to be evaluated to improve survival and quality of life in HIV-HL."

8810,0.003,3.0,"Mutations associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) resistance to lamivudine have not been extensively addressed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-HBV coinfection. We have studied the HBV polymerase sequences from nine coinfected patients who experienced HBV recurrence while under lamivudine treatment. In seven of these nine patients, Met(550), belonging to the highly conserved YMDD motif, was mutated to Val and was associated with a substitution of Met for Leu(526) in each case. In the two remaining patients, we found a Met(550)-to-Ile change that was associated in only one case with a Leu(526)-to-Met mutation. No mutation was observed in three control patients not receiving lamivudine. This study demonstrates the emergence of particular genetic profiles in HBV-HIV-coinfected patients experiencing a loss of control of HBV infection despite high doses of lamivudine."
3289,0.003,3.0,"There are sparse epidemiologic data on coinfection of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) in the United States. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of HBV coinfection in a large U.S. population of HCV patients. We used the National Veterans Affairs HCV Clinical Case Registry to identify patients tested for HCV during 1997-2005. Patients were categorized based on HCV exposure (any two +HCV tests or one test with a diagnostic code), HCV infection (+RNA or genotype), HBV exposure (any +HBV test, excluding +HBsAb only), and HBV infection (+HBsAg, HBV DNA, or HBeAg). The prevalence of HBV exposure among patients with HCV exposure and that of HBV infection among patients with HCV infection were determined. Multivariate logistic regression evaluated potential demographic and clinical predictors of HBV coinfection. Among 168,239 patients with HCV exposure, 58,415 patients had HBV exposure for a prevalence of 34.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 34.5-35.0). Among 102,971 patients with HCV infection, 1,431 patients had HBV coinfection for a prevalence of 1.4% (95% CI 1.3-1.5). Independent associations with HBV coinfection compared with HCV monoinfection were age ≤ 50 years, male sex, positive HIV status, history of hemophilia, sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, history of blood transfusion, cocaine and other drug use; there was decreased risk in patients of Hispanic ethnicity."
9870,0.003,3.0,"Human antibody response to Cryptosporidium parvum has been previously shown as involving immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG isotypes. The interest in anti-cryptosporidial IgA antibody response has been recently stimulated by studies on the therapeutic effects of secretory IgA antibodies to Cryptosporidium in animal models and in patients. In the present study, isotypes of serum anti-Cryptosporidium antibodies have been characterized in donors of the following categories: (a) healthy adults, (b) healthy children, (c) immunocompetent children with transient cryptosporidial diarrhea, (d) HIV-infected patients without clinical and parasitological evidence of Cryptosporidium infection and (e) AIDS patients with cryptosporidial diarrhea. Antibodies were detected using C. parvum oocysts purified by density gradient centrifugation from bovine faeces. The IgA antibodies were revealed using alpha-chain specific antibodies. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis with oocysts was used as control. Although high levels of serum antibodies of the IgA class were detected in some donors in the group of healthy adults, elevated values were consistently found in HIV-infected patients. Higher values were found in HIV patients with clinical cryptosporidiosis. The presence of a secretory component in serum IgA antibodies in these patients has been documented. Data indicate that IgA serum antibodies are produced as well as IgM and IgG antibodies upon contact with the parasite, and suggest that elevated IgA serum antibodies to Cryptosporidium are not associated with protection in HIV patients."
5107,0.003,3.0,"Cryptosporidium spp. are a major cause of diarrheal disease in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient individuals. They also cause waterborne disease in both the United States and United Kingdom. Studies on the mechanisms of immunity to cryptosporidiosis indicate the importance of the T-cell response. The spectrum and severity of disease in immunocompromised individuals with cryptosporidiosis reflect this importance since the most severe disease is seen in individuals with defects in the T-cell response. The most commonly studied group is that of patients with AIDS. These patients suffer from more severe and prolonged gastrointestinal disease that can be fatal; in addition, body systems other than the gastrointestinal tract may be affected. The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy does appear to be having a beneficial effect on recovery from cryptosporidiosis and on the frequency of infection in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients. Other diseases that are associated with increased risk of severe cryptosporidiosis, such as primary immunodeficiencies, most notably severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, are also predominantly associated with T-cell defects. Of the remaining groups, children with acute leukemia seem to be most at risk from cryptosporidiosis. There is less evidence of severe complications in patients with other malignant diseases or in those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy."
3355,0.003,3.0,"Evaluation of HIV-induced IL-2 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and HIV-specific T helper and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in health care workers (HCW) occupationally exposed to HIV reveals a high rate of response to HIV among non-seroconverters. IL-10 is also known to interfere with HIV infection in vitro. To evaluate the induction of IL-10 by HIV antigens in HCW occupationally exposed to HIV, 18 HCW with percutaneous injury were enrolled in this study, 9 of them exposed to HIV-contaminated blood, and 9 exposed to HIV-negative blood. PBMC were incubated on plates coated with HIV-1 antigens, and IL-10 was measured in supernatants by ELISA. Five of nine HCW exposed to HIV-contaminated blood presented HIV-induced IL-10. Two of nine HCW exposed to HIV-negative source patients also had detectable levels of HIV-induced IL-10, one of them in the sample obtained on the day of accidental exposure. There was a relationship between the type of device involved in injury and IL-10 production. Individuals exposed to hollow needles or scalpels presented HIV-induced IL-10, whereas those exposed to solid needles and to digital puncture did not, suggesting a relationship between infectious load and IL-10. Although occupational exposure to HIV leads to a low rate of seroconversion, these individuals can develop an antigen-specific immune response characterized in our study by induction of IL-10 in PBMC in vitro."

Apoptotic cell death of microvascular endothelial cells might be a pathogenetic clue to this disease. For defining further the pattern of cellular injury in this model, serial kidney sections of 58 macaques infected with HIV-2 and 7 uninfected controls were studied by routine microscopy, terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, and immunohistochemistry for single-stranded DNA, p53, the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene-1 peptide product, caspase-3, and the proliferation marker Ki67. Selected cases were further evaluated by in situ end labeling and transmission electron microscopy. Kidneys of 13 HIV-2-infected animals contained a pattern of cellular injury, which was characterized by (1) nuclear swelling with an ultrastructural morphology different from apoptotic nuclei, (2) sharply demarcated areas of renal cells with chromatin nicks (TUNEL positive) and single-stranded DNA, (3) absence of an inflammatory or proliferative response, (4) upregulation of p53 and loss of at least one cellular differentiation marker (Wilms' tumor suppressor gene-1), (5) a tight correlation with the diagnosis of renal TMA, and (6) a contrast between profound changes in the renal cellular morphology and the apparently unaffected clinical condition of the host. This pattern of injury, which shares some features of both apoptotic and oncotic necrosis, might be involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated renal TMA in this model."
2154,0.003,3.0,"The pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) associated dementia in adults involves neuronal loss from discrete areas of the neocortex and subcortical regions, but the mechanism for neuronal death is poorly understood. Gene-directed cell death resulting in apoptosis is thought to be a normal feature of neuronal development, but little is known about neuronal apoptosis in disease states. We investigated whether HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system is spatially associated with apoptosis of neurons. Using an in situ technique to identify newly cleaved 3'-OH ends of DNA as a marker for apoptosis, we demonstrate the presence of apoptotic neurons in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia of children that had HIV-1 encephalitis with progressive encephalopathy. Furthermore, an association was observed between the localization of apoptotic neurons and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates containing HIV-1 infected macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. Apoptotic neurons and p24-positive macrophages were observed infrequently in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia in children with HIV-1 infection without encephalitis or clinical encephalopathy. In nine control (HIV-1 negative) brains, ranging from the first post-natal month of life to 16.5 years of age, infrequent neuronal apoptosis was observed in three cases. These findings suggest that neuronal apoptosis is unlikely to be associated with post-natal development except in early post-natal germinal matrix, and that it may instead represent the end result of specific pathological processes, such as HIV-1 encephalitis."
6268,0.003,3.0,"Nine black children aged between 3 months and 30 months of age, with human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) infection are described to draw the attention of health professionals in southern Africa to special clinical characteristics useful for recognising this problem, which has many shared features with common diseases of infancy and childhood in the Third World. The main presenting complaints were chronic cough and persistent diarrhoea and vomiting. These children frequently had diarrhoea (8 of 9 patients), mucocutaneous candidiasis (8), pneumonia (7), hepatosplenomegaly (9), significant lymphadenopathy (5) and wasting (5). All were infected by common bacteria, such as Gram-negative organisms, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Campylobacter jejuni, or by opportunistic infections such as Candida or cytomegalovirus (CMV), or by both bacterial and opportunistic organisms. A raised total serum globulin level, anaemia, lymphopenia and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis were frequent findings. Incomplete data on parental HIV status suggest perinatal transmission. Three of the children were HIV-antigen positive. The diagnosis of full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), using the stringent Centers for Disease Control criteria, is difficult in our situation because of limited diagnostic resources; however, using these criteria, and the clinical case definition for AIDS recommended by World Health Organisation, it is thought that probably 4 of these children could be considered as having AIDS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
1815,0.003,3.0,"An enhanced, refocused research agenda is critical to reducing the burden of tuberculosis (TB) in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic in developing countries. TB threatens HIV-infected patients before and after initiation of antiretroviral therapy, is difficult to diagnose, is rapidly fatal when it is drug resistant, and is being spread in clinics and hospitals. Research priorities include improved and point-of-care TB diagnostics; TB treatment and prevention during HIV infection, drug-resistant TB, and childhood TB; and optimization of TB and HIV program integration. With new TB diagnostics and drugs reaching approval, research must focus on effectively deploying these advancements. Research must include evaluations of individual, household, health care, and community approaches. Studies must apply implementation science to determine how to increase and adapt effective interventions to reduce TB burden in the context of HIV infection. Investment in this research will improve the lives of persons infected with HIV and contribute to efforts to reduce the global TB burden."
3940,0.003,3.0,"Neuronal apoptosis within the central nervous system (CNS) is a characteristic feature of AIDS dementia, and it represents a common mechanism of neuronal death induced by neurotoxins (e.g., glutamate) released from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected macrophages (HIV/macrophage-induced neurotoxicity). Neuronal apoptosis may result from activation of the intrinsic (mitochondrial/bcl-2 regulated) or extrinsic (death receptor) pathways, although which pathway predominates in CNS HIV infection is unknown. Apoptosis initiated by the intrinsic pathway is typically blocked by antiapoptosis Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, but whether these can block HIV/macrophage-induced neuronal apoptosis is unknown. To determine the potential role of the Bcl-2 family in HIV/macrophage-induced neuronal apoptosis, we developed a unique in vitro model, utilizing the NT2 neuronal cell line, primary astrocytes and macrophages, and primary CNS HIV type 1 (HIV-1) isolates. We validated our model by demonstrating that NT2.N neurons are protected against HIV-infected macrophages by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonists, similar to effects seen in primary neurons. We then established stable NT2.N neuronal lines that overexpress Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (NT2.N/bcl-2 and NT2.N/bcl-xL, respectively) and determined their sensitivity to macrophages infected with primary R5, X4, and R5/X4 HIV-1 isolates. We found that NT2.N/bcl-2 and NT2.N/bcl-xL neurons were resistant to apoptosis induced by either R5, X4, or R5/X4 isolates and that resistance was abrogated by a Bcl-2 antagonist. Thus, the NMDA receptor/bcl-2-regulated apoptotic pathway contributes significantly to HIV/macrophage-induced neuronal apoptosis, and Bcl-2 family proteins protect neurons against the spectrum of primary HIV-1 isolates.

Early identification requires the measurement of various body composition parameters, particularly body cell mass (BCM). Anthropometry may provide some useful information. Cost and complexity issues make many body composition techniques unsuitable for the clinical setting. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) may be the best method available to caregivers for monitoring serial changes in BCM over time and for determining the occurrence of wasting. It is not useful, however, for detecting body composition changes in patients with fat redistribution syndromes. Portability, low cost, ease of use, and patient acceptance make anthropometry and BIA ideally suited for the clinical setting."
4843,0.003,3.0,We encountered a patient with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy associated with hepatitis B infection. Immunohistochemical study revealed the deposition of immune complex composed of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) both around the endoneural capillary and in the endoneurium. Neurological signs were significantly improved by immunoadsorption plasmapheresis (IAPP) treatment without incorporating corticosteroid hormone therapy; weekly long-term IAPP has successfully maintained the patient's condition.
876,0.003,3.0,"To assess the association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa, a cross-sectional case-control study was conducted on 301 HAT patients recruited in the main foci of the country. For each HAT patient, 3 controls, matched for sex, age and residence, were selected. Data relating to socio-demographic factors and potential risk factors for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and HIV infections were obtained, and serum samples were collected for HIV-1 and HIV-2 tests. A positive test consisted of enzyme immunoassay reactive to HIV-1, HIV-2 or both and confirmed by a synthetic peptide test or Western blot. Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression with EGRET software. No statistically significant difference was found between the prevalence of HIV infection in HAT patients and controls (4.3% and 3.5% respectively; crude odds ratio (OR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-2.50). In multivariate analysis, allowance for 5 covariates did not change the association between the 2 infections (adjusted OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.64-2.52). Although this study had limited statistical power, no significant association was found between HIV infection and T.b. gambiense infection in rural Côte d'Ivoire. Studies are needed to determine whether HIV infection influences the clinical course of HAT, a question not addressed in the present study."
307,0.003,3.0,"In this observational single-center cohort study outside the clinical trial setting, outcome and predictors of virologic failure of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) containing a protease inhibitor were evaluated in human immunodeficiency (HIV)-infected persons. The study population consisted of 807 protease inhibitor-naive HIV-seropositive patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy with reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors (indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir) between January 1997 and January 1999. Demographic variable, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+ T-cell count, adverse drug reactions, and adherence to HAART were assessed. Virologic treatment response was defined as a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA load from baseline to below 500 copies per milliliter after 12 months of therapy. Levels of HIV-1 RNA were undetectable in 43% of patients at 12 months. Factors associated with failure to suppress viral load included age 40 years or younger, baseline CD4+ T cell count less than 200 x 10(6) per liter baseline viral load greater than 4.3 log(10) per milliliter, and non-adherence to HAART. After adjustment by logistic regression, non-adherence was the only statistically significant variable associated with virologic failure (odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.67). Unselected patients in whom protease inhibitor is started in a usual clinical setting achieve viral suppression less frequently than do patients in controlled clinical trials. Failure to adherence to HAART was the strongest predictor of virologic failure."
9436,0.003,3.0,"The constellation of nephrotic proteinuria, FSGS, and rapid loss of renal function in a patient infected with HIV-1 has been sufficiently widespread and well documented to justify identification as a specific renal syndrome, HIV-associated nephropathy. The position paper of the National Kidney Foundation-National Institutes of Health task force estimated in 1990 that 10,000 to 15,000 persons will develop renal disease in association with AIDS [94]. Management of these patients is complex, and many will reach ESRD and require dialysis treatment, posing additional care problems. Greater understanding of the pathogenesis of the renal disease should lead to treatments which will forestall the development of HIVAN and possibly other forms of fibrotic renal disease. The ultimate eradication of AIDS will consign this renal syndrome to an interesting footnote in the history of nephrology. Since that time is still far in the future, nephrologists will continue to be faced with the need to diagnose and treat HIV-1-infected patients with renal involvement."

919,0.003,3.0,"Antiretroviral therapy is increasingly available in African communities. We set out to gain patient perceptions on factors that facilitate and challenge access and adherence to such therapy. We carried out two semi-structured interviews 12 months apart with 40 HIV-positive people drawn from three economically deprived townships in the Copperbelt, Zambia. We also conducted a focus group of 12 of these interviewees. Availability of medication in health facilities did not automatically ensure access to those in need. A prerequisite for commencing on treatment was a positive documented HIV test result, but too few HIV testing centres, fear of family and community rejection and male domination in sexual and social decision-making prevented a number from coming forward to be tested. Once within the system of care, further barriers, such as rumours of bad side-effects, inconsistent information, high costs of drugs (at the time of the first interviews), ongoing costs of additional medical tests, overcrowded systems and overworked staff, all hindered access to receiving treatment. When taken, therapy brought side-effects, the most common being increased appetite and hunger. Yet, despite these barriers and challenges many of those on treatment reported good adherence. Immediate factors, such as seeing ill people becoming well; being supported by a friend or family member; and having a watch or clock to keep to a regular regime, were important. The increase in the number of people who were expected to die but were now looking well also shifted community attitudes. HIV/AIDS is beginning to move from a hidden terminal disease to a chronic condition that is treatable."
540,0.003,3.0,"Puerto Rico has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS seen for any US state or territory, and antiretroviral therapy has been a mainstay of efforts to mitigate the HIV/AIDS public health burden on the island. We studied the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 mutation and antiretroviral drug resistance in Puerto Rico by monitoring the population frequency of resistance-associated mutations from 2002 to 2011. Whole blood samples from 4,475 patients were analyzed using the TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit and OpenGene DNA Sequencing System in the Immunoretrovirus Research Laboratory at Universidad Central del Caribe. Results show that 64.0% of female and 62.9% of male patients had HIV-1 mutations that confer resistance to at least one antiretroviral medication. L63P and M184V were the dominant mutations observed for the protease (PRO) and reverse transcriptase (RT) encoding genes, respectively. Specific resistance mutations, along with their associated drug resistance profiles, can be seen to form temporal clusters that reveal a steadily changing landscape of resistance trends over time. Both women and men showed resistance mutations for an average of 4.8 drugs over the 10-year period, further underscoring the strong selective pressure exerted by antiretrovirals along with the rapid adaptive response of HIV. Nevertheless, both female and male patients showed a precipitous decrease for overall drug resistance, and for PRO mutations in particular, over the entire course of the study, with the most rapid decrease in frequency seen after 2006. The reduced HIV-1 mutation and drug resistance trends that we observed are consistent with previous reports from multi-year studies conducted around the world. Reduced resistance can be attributed to the use of more efficacious antiretroviral drug therapy, including the introduction of multi-drug combination therapies, which limited the ability of the virus to mount rapid adaptive responses to antiretroviral selection pressure."

We established the use of tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) for detecting IL28B rs8099917 genotype (T>G) in 56 Chinese chronic hepatitis C patients infected with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1. The new assay showed 98.2% specificity, and was confirmed by direct sequencing. Among the 56 samples, TT genotype and TG genotype accounted for 80.4% (45/56) and 19.6% (11/56), respectively. GG genotype was not found. The proportion of responders in TT group was higher than that in TG group (68.9% vs. 27.3%, p=0.029). For HCV clinical decision-making, using the new assay, rs8099917 genotyping could provide similar information to rs12979860 genotyping due to a strong association between the two SNPs in Chinese patients. The assay system in this study can be implemented using basic laboratory equipments, making it convenient for clinical and research purposes."

Among HIV-infected youth, mean age of testing was 18.2 years. One third of the HIV-positive patients were female and four fifths were African-American or Hispanic. No significant differences were found between HIV-positive (n = 50) and HIV-negative (n = 43) patients for age at first intercourse, injecting or other illicit drug use, history of sexually transmitted diseases, or survival sex (exchange of sex for money or drugs). HIV-positive males were more likely than HIV-negative males to have engaged in anal intercourse and to report a history of sexual abuse. Among infected females, 82% acquired HIV through heterosexual intercourse. Almost half (48%) of HIV-positive adolescents had significant immune dysfunction at the time of their initial visit (CD4 < 500/mm3) and were eligible for zidovudine. Many HIV-positive adolescents continued high-risk behaviors such as intercourse without condoms, particularly those with ongoing dependence on drugs or alcohol. With the epidemic of HIV infection increasing nationwide among adolescents, specialized, comprehensive programs are needed to counsel and treat HIV-infected adolescents and youth in high-risk situations."

8485,0.003,3.0,"The recent availability of non-invasive tools to measure liver fibrosis has allowed examination of its extent and determination of predictors in all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. On the other hand, most information on hepatic fibrosis in HCV/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-coinfected patients has been derived from liver biopsies taken before highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was widely available. All consecutive HCV patients with elevated aminotransferases seen during the last 3 years were evaluated and liver fibrosis measured using transient elastography (FibroScan) and biochemical indexes. Patients were split according to their HIV serostatus. A total of 656 (69.6%) HCV-monoinfected and 287 (30.4%) HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were assessed. Mean CD4 count of coinfected patients was 493 cells/muL and 88% were under HAART (mean time, 4.2 +/- 2.4 years). Advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis was recognized in 39% of the coinfected and 18% of the monoinfected patients (P < 0.005). A good correlation was found between FibroScan) and biochemical indexes [AST to platelet ratio index (r = 0.405, P < 0.0001), FIB-4 (r = 0.393, P < 0.0001) and Forns (r = 0.407, P < 0.0001)], regardless of the HIV status. In the multivariate analysis, age >45 years, body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m(2), and HIV infection were independently associated with advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients have more advanced liver fibrosis than HCV-monoinfected patients despite the immunologic benefit of HAART."
7825,0.003,3.0,"Non invasive liver fibrosis scores have been proposed as alternatives to liver biopsy in hepatitis C virus (HCV) -infected patients. We assessed the impact of antiviral treatment on non invasive serological markers of liver fibrosis in HIV-HCV co-infected patients who received 48-weeks of HCV treatment. In HIV-HCV co-infected patients, HCV clearance was associated with a significant reduction in non invasive fibrosis serological markers, which most likely reflect the histological improvement associated with sustained virologic response. We assessed the association between insulin resistance, liver fibrosis, and liver steatosis in HIV-HCV and HCV-infected patients. Insulin resistance was associated with liver fibrosis and steatosis in HCV mono-infected but not in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. Significant liver fibrosis was associated with insulin resistance independent of liver steatosis only in HCV mono-infected patients. We also assessed the impact of insulin resistance on the response to HCV therapy in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. A high HOMA-IR level was frequently found in HIV-HCV co-infected patients and was associated with a reduced sustained virologic response rate. Improving insulin sensitivity may be a useful adjunct to HCV therapy in HIV-HCV co-infected patients."

The CC genotype at rs12979860 of the IL28B is associated with greater rates of spontaneous clearance of HCV and response to antiviral therapy. IL28B acts on the interferon-stimulated genes through the JAK-STAT pathway, which is related to the development of insulin resistance.

Of 209 family practice residents and clinical faculty from the four UCLA-affiliated family practice residency programs surveyed, 110 (53%) responded. Each physician was presented with an identical set of five clinical scenarios and asked to make an HIV screening decision in each case. The physicians were also asked to choose from a list of 11 physician roles the one role that best described why they chose to recommend or not recommend an HIV screening test in each particular scenario. Marked variation was observed among the physicians' HIV screening recommendations. The degree of variation was similar between residents and clinical faculty. The physicians predominantly cited concern for the patient's well-being over concern for the public's well-being in making their HIV screening decisions. Three physician roles, (1) to protect the patient from mental suffering, (2) to protect the unborn from disease, and (3) to optimize the patient's future health care, were the roles most cited when an HIV screening test was recommended. Two physician roles, (1) to protect the patient from mental suffering, and (2) to allocate limited health resources properly, were the roles most cited when an HIV screening test was not recommended."
9655,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat is a potent transcriptional activator of the HIV-1 promoter and also has the ability to modulate a number of cellular regulatory circuits including apoptosis. Tat exerts its effects through interaction with viral as well as cellular proteins. Here, we studied the influence of p73, a protein that is implicated in apoptosis and cell cycle control, on Tat functions in the central nervous system. Protein interaction studies using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated the association of Tat with p73. Tat bound to the N-terminal region of p73 spanning amino acids 1 to 120, and this interaction required the cysteine-rich domain (amino acids 30 to 40) of Tat. Association of p73 with Tat prevented the acetylation of Tat on lysine 28 by PCAF. Functional studies including RNA interference showed that p73 inhibited Tat stimulation of the HIV-1 promoter. Furthermore, p73 prevented the interaction of Tat with cyclin T1 in vitro but not in vivo. These findings suggest possible new therapeutic approaches, using p73, for Tat-mediated AIDS pathogenesis."

We aimed to describe the epidemiological, virological and clinical characteristics of HBV infections newly diagnosed in 2011 in University hospitals of Marseille, the second largest French city. HBV serology was performed for 18,130 sera from 15,744 patients. A total of 167 patients were newly-diagnosed with HBV based upon the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis B core antibodies. Clinico-epidemiological features were analyzed for 78 patients. Patients included a majority of men (59%), women being significantly younger with a mean age of 36 ± 17 versus 43.5 ± 16.2 years (P = 0.009). Country of birth was available for 52 patients and 35% of them originated from sub-Saharan Africa. Levels of the liver biological parameters were significantly lower in women compared to men, in whom mean alanine aminotransferase and gammaglutamyl transferase levels were 24 ± 39 versus 37 ± 36 IU/l (P = 0.0001) and 20 ± 20 versus 51 ± 53 IU/l (P = 0.0001), respectively. Co-infections with hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency viruses were found in 5% and 6% of the patients, respectively. HBV DNA was detectable in 90% of the HBeAg-negative patients. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the HBsAg titer and the HBV DNA level (P = 0.001). Genotype D was the most common HBV genotype and was found in 53% of the patients tested, followed by genotype E (21%). HBV remains a major concern with a slightly greater number of new diagnoses than in 2004. HBV genetic diversity was substantial in the present cohort."

This, combined with effective HIV treatment which has significantly prolonged life expectancy, means that health care professionals working in the UK can expect to see increasing numbers of older people with HIV infection. In this review article, we summarise the epidemiology of HIV amongst older people, including data from our local cohort in the city of Sheffield, UK. We discuss specific and practical issues in older patients including why older people are at risk, how to make a diagnosis and the importance of doing so early, guidelines for HIV testing and an update on anti-retroviral therapy including drug interactions and side effects."

Human placental cord blood (HPCB) is a rich source of CD34+AC133+ cells. Since AC133 antibody is likely to be used as an alternative to CD34 for the selection of stem cells in transplant and gene therapy situations, we examined the susceptibility of HPCB-isolated CD34+AC133+ stem cells to infection with free and cell-associated HIV-1 in vitro. Freshly isolated HPCB CD34+AC133+ stem cells were not susceptible to HIV-1 infection as determined by PCR and reverse transcriptase assays. Inoculation with HIV-1 did not affect the viability and clonogenic ability of HPCB CD34+AC133+ cells. Although the highly purified HPCB CD34+AC133+ stem cells contained mRNA for CD4 and CXCR4 receptors, CD4 and CXCR4 proteins were not expressed on these cells. Similarly, CCR5 protein, the major macrophage-tropic HIV-1 coreceptor, was not expressed in freshly isolated HPCB CD34+AC133+ stem cells, although the transcript for CCR5 was identified in these cells. Expression of CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5 receptor proteins on the progeny derived from HPCB CD34+AC133+ stem cells was detected and correlated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in vitro. These findings suggest that freshly isolated HPCB CD34+AC133+ stem cells are not susceptible to HIV-1 infection and may not be a viral reservoir. These data have important implications for the use of AC133 antibody as a means of enriching for primitive hematopoietic stem cells from placental cord blood and in the design of stem cell or progenitor cell-based gene therapeutic strategies for perinatal HIV-1 infection."
5844,0.003,3.0,"The pathogenesis of cellular immune deficiency following human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection could result from quantitative and/or qualitative dysfunction of the CD4+ lymphocyte population. To better characterize the T-cell response to soluble antigen with HIV infection, we have isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes and purified populations of CD4+ lymphocytes from healthy HIV antibody-positive subjects, patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex (ARC), and healthy HIV antibody-negative controls. T-lymphocyte function was determined by proliferative response to lectin (phytohemagglutinin), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), calcium ionophore, purified recombinant HIV envelope gp120, tetanus toxoid antigen, and tetanus toxoid antigen in the presence of recombinant gp120 or purified recombinant soluble CD4. PBLs and CD4+ lymphocytes from asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects responded equally well to lectin, PMA, and/or calcium ionophore and to tetanus toxoid as cells from uninfected control subjects. The cells that proliferated in response to a soluble antigenic stimulus did not respond to gp120. Cells from subjects with ARC had a selective antigen recognition defect independent of the number of CD4+ lymphocytes. Recombinant gp120 inhibited CD4+ lymphocyte proliferation to antigenic stimulus by 30-40%. Recombinant soluble CD4, a proposed therapeutic for HIV, had no effect on T-cell response to antigen. A selective antigen recognition response was not compromised early in HIV infection but was compromised in subjects with ARC. Inhibition of proliferation to tetanus toxoid by gp120 suggests that HIV may affect major histocompatibility complex II restricted antigen recognition independent of CD4+ cell loss."

Seventy-six participants with HIV who were on follow-up management at three non-governmental care and treatment agencies in south western, Nigeria were asked to complete a questionnaire detailing their demographic characteristics, duration of awareness of HIV status, medication status, membership of a support group, HIV-related knowledge (including number of workshops/seminars attended, reading of literature), and attitude toward their illness and treatment. Compared to those who did not belong to a support group, (34, 45%), those who did (42, 55%) were significantly more knowledgeable about HIV-related (t=4.02, p=0.00) and also reported more favorable attitudes toward the illness and its treatment (t=3.38, p=0.005). A multiple regression analysis indicated that group membership and a longer period of awareness of HIV infection contributed significantly to illness knowledge and attitudes. Age, sex, years of education, medication status, and employment status did not contribute significantly to these outcome variables. Individuals living with HIV/AIDS who belonged to a support group and had availed themselves of relevant literature were more knowledgeable and positive about their illness than those who did not belong to support groups. HIV/AIDS support group membership is an important component of psycho-social care in HIV/AIDS patients in Nigeria and should be encouraged."

4233,0.003,3.0,"In order to assess the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug resistance mutation profiles and evaluate the distribution of the genetic subtypes in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, blood samples from 547 HIV-1 infected patients failing antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, were collected during the years 2002 and 2003 to perform the viral resistance genotyping at the Renageno Laboratory from Rio de Janeiro (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation). Viral resistance genotyping was performed using ViroSeq Genotyping System (Celera Diagnostic-Abbott, US). The HIV-1 subtyping based on polymerase (pol) gene sequences (protease and reverse transcriptase-RT regions) was as follows: subtype B (91.2%), subtype F (4.9%), and B/F viral recombinant forms (3.3%). The subtype C was identified in two patients (0.4%) and the recombinant CRF_02/AG virus was found infecting one patient (0.2%). The HIV-1 genotyping profile associated to the reverse transcriptase inhibitors has shown a high frequency of the M184V mutation followed by the timidine-associated mutations. The K103N mutation was the most prevalent to the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor and the resistance associated to protease inhibitor showed the minor mutations L63P, L10F/R, and A71V as the more prevalent. A large proportion of subtype B was observed in HIV-1 treated patients from Rio de Janeiro. In addition, we have identified the circulation of drug-resistant HIV-1 subtype C and are presenting the first report of the occurrence of an African recombinant CRF_02/AG virus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A clear association between HIV-1 subtypes and protease resistance mutations was observed in this study. The maintenance of resistance genotyping programs for HIV-1 failing patients is important to the management of ARV therapies and to attempt and monitor the HIV-1 subtype prevalence in Brazil."
7359,0.003,3.0,"The effectiveness of antiviral treatments of chronic hepatitis B has been poorly studied in Brazil. Here, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA positivity, drug resistance mutations and their association with HBV genotypes were evaluated in chronically HBV-infected patients under different drug regimens in Brazil. The study involved 129 patients under interferon or nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy for a median treatment time of 12 months. One hundred and five (81%) of these patients were treated with lamivudine (LAM), either in monotherapy or in combination with newer drugs, such as entecavir (ETV) or tenofovir (TDF). High (37.5-100%) rates of HBV DNA positivity were observed with all but one drug regimen (LAM + ETV). However, patients that were treated with ETV alone, TDF alone or with LAM combination therapies had a mean viral load that was 3-4 log lower than patients treated with LAM monotherapy. Of the patients treated with LAM, 47% developed resistance mutations. HBV genotypes A (59.1%), D (30.3%) and F (9.1%) were found. There was no association between the presence of LAM resistance mutations and genotypes, HBeAg status or treatment duration. Nevertheless, the rtM204V mutation was observed more frequently (12/13, 92%) in genotype A than in the others (p = 0.023). Six out of nine isolates that contained the rtM204I mutation belonged to genotype D and half of them displayed a single mutation. Genotype D isolates with the rtM204V variant preferentially displayed a triple mutation, while genotype A preferentially displayed a double mutation (p = 0.04)."

Despite two stop codons in the precore region characteristic of HBV/G, all patients were positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in serum. When 10 HBV clones were propagated from one patient, and sequenced within precore region and a section of the core gene, 6 clones were HBV/G while 2 were genotype A (HBV/A); a recombination between HBV/G and HBV/A occurred in the remaining 2 clones. Mixed infection of HBV/G and HBV/A, as well as the recombination, was demonstrated in the sequence of preS1 and preS2 regions also. Coinfection with HBV/G and HBV/A was demonstrated in the other three patients, and their recombination in two patients. Ten HBV clones were propagated from one patient at two time points separated by 1 year. Clones of HBV/A, HBV/G and their recombination were found in 9 : 1 : 0 when the patient was positive for HBeAg, while the proportion shifted to 0 : 8 : 2 after the patient seroconverted to anti-HBe. In conclusion, HBV/G is frequently found as a coinfection with HBV/A. This coinfection would explain the presence of HBeAg in individuals infected with HBV/G. Along with seroconversion to anti-HBe, HBV/G would be selected accompanied by the recombination with HBV/A. Further studies should be performed to confirm these findings."
3394,0.003,3.0,"Characteristic pathological alterations of the liver in chimpanzees inoculated with non-A, non-B hepatitis sera have been described, but no corresponding findings have been reported in humans. Electron microscopic studies of the liver biopsy specimens of two homosexual patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, one without hepatitis (Patient 1) and one with chronic active hepatitis in remission (Patient 2), revealed the cytoplasmic tubular structures which are characteristic of chimpanzee non-A, non-B hepatitis. A cluster of 23 nm double-shelled particles was also seen in the cytoplasm of a hepatocyte in patient 1 who had received a blood transfusion 8 days before the biopsy. These particles were smaller than the Dane particles, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex virus, and different from hepatitis A virus particles; the antibodies to all of which are found in high concentration in acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients. These observations may reflect the morphologic findings for non-A, non-B hepatitis infection in humans."
3382,0.003,3.0,"To investigate the mechanism by which immune activation augments replication of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in infected T cells, four different classes of T cell mitogens were evaluated for their effects on the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), a mitogenic lectin; phorbol 12-myristic 13-acetate, a tumor promoter; ionomycin, a calcium ionophore; and tat-1, the trans-activator protein from the human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) each stimulated the HIV-1 LTR. Studies of deleted forms of the LTR supported a central role in these responses for the HIV-1 enhancer, which alone was sufficient for mitogen inducibility, but also suggested that other 5' positive and negative regulatory elements contribute to the overall magnitude of the response. Synergistic activation of the HIV-1 LTR (up to several thousandfold) was observed with combinations of these mitogens and the HIV-1--derived tat-III protein. Cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive agent, inhibited PHA-mediated activation of the HIV-1 LTR but was without effect in the presence of other mitogens. Thus, HIV-1 gene expression and replication appear to be regulated, via the HIV-1 LTR, by the same mitogenic signals that induce T cell activation."
906,0.003,3.0,"The surface (HBsAg) and core (HBcAg) antigens of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been searched by optic microscopy in the liver specimens from patients hospitalized for various conditions and from 38 HGsAg chronic carriers. The study was done blindly using Shikata et al.'s orcein staining on fixed and frozen material and direct immunoperoxidase on frozen material with antisera specific for surface (anti-HBs) and core (anti-HBc) antigens of HBV. No liver staining could be found in the 98 HBsAg seronegative patients. Among the 28 HBsAg seropositive patients, only 3 showed positive staining: 1 patient with acute viral hepatitis showed nuclear staining with anti-HBc; 2 patients with postnecrotic cirrhosis showed cytoplasmic staining with anti-HBs and/or orcein, and one of them also showed nuclear staining with anti-HBc. In contrast, among the 38 chronic carriers, 25 showed positive cytoplasmic staining with anti-HBs and/or orcein, while one of them (with chronic aggressive hepatitis) also showed nuclear staining with anti-HBc. Anti-HBs and orcein staining are equally sensitive and specific for the detection of HBsAg in hepatocytes; discrepant results can be attributed to sampling error of distribution of HBsAg in small liver fragments."
7739,0.003,3.0,"The efficacy of oral, intestinal, nasal, and vaginal vaccinations with DNA simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/interleukin-2 (IL-2)/IL-15, SIV Gag/Pol/Env recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA), and AT-2 SIVmac239 inactivated particles was compared in rhesus macaques after low-dose vaginal challenge with SIVmac251. Intestinal immunization provided better protection from infection, as a significantly greater median number of challenges was necessary in this group than in the others. Oral and nasal vaccinations provided the most significant control of disease progression. Fifty percent of the orally and nasally vaccinated animals suppressed viremia to undetectable levels, while this occurred to a significantly lower degree in intestinally and vaginally vaccinated animals and in controls. Viremia remained undetectable after CD8(+) T-cell depletion in seven vaccinated animals that had suppressed viremia after infection, and tissue analysis for SIV DNA and RNA was negative, a result consistent with a significant reduction of viral activity. Regardless of the route of vaccination, mucosal vaccinations prevented loss of CD4(+) central memory and CD4(+)/α4β7(+) T-cell populations and reduced immune activation to different degrees. None of the orally vaccinated animals and only one of the nasally vaccinated animals developed AIDS after 72 to 84 weeks of infection, when the trial was closed. The levels of anti-SIV gamma interferon-positive, CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells at the time of first challenge inversely correlated with viremia and directly correlated with protection from infection and longer survival.

9951,0.003,3.0,"A randomized, controlled, clinical trial was conducted to examine the impact of a semistructured, 10-week, once weekly, 90-min/session bereavement support group intervention on immunological, neuroendocrine, and clinical health status in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-seropositive (HIV-1+) and HIV-1-seronegative (HIV-1-) homosexual men, compared to a standard of care control condition. A total of 119 homosexual men (74 HIV-1+ and 45 HIV-1-) were assessed at baseline, 10 weeks, and 6 months follow-up. At the 6-month follow-up assessment, the intervention groups exhibited significant beneficial effects compared to controls on changes in CD4 cell, total T-lymphocyte, and total lymphocyte counts, when baseline levels, antiretroviral medication use, CDC stage of disease, and other potentially confounding factors were accounted for. There was no statistically significant effect on the CD4/CD8 ratio or on the CD8 cell count. The effect on CD4 cell count was associated with group attendance and with changes in plasma cortisol level. Plasma cortisol levels decreased significantly among intervention subjects, compared to controls. A significantly reduced number of health care visits over the 6-month follow-up period among the intervention subjects supported the clinical relevance of the immunological changes observed for both HIV-1+ and HIV-1- individuals. These results indicate that behavioral interventions may have salutary immunological and clinical health effects following bereavement among HIV-1-infected individuals. The effect in HIV-1- individuals suggests that this bereavement support group intervention might have similar salutary effects in the general population. Potential effects of such interventions on clinical HIV disease progression are of interest and should be studied."
216,0.003,3.0,"The adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-based vaccine developed by Merck failed to either prevent HIV-1 infection or suppress viral load in subsequently infected subjects in the STEP human Phase 2b efficacy trial. Analogous vaccines had previously also failed in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) challenge-rhesus macaque model. In contrast, vaccine protection studies that used challenge with a chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV89.6P) in macaques did not predict the human trial results. Ad5 vector-based vaccines did not protect macaques from infection after SHIV89.6P challenge but did cause a substantial reduction in viral load and a preservation of CD4+ T cell counts after infection, findings that were not reproduced in the human trials. Although the SIV challenge model is incompletely validated, we propose that its expanded use can help facilitate the prioritization of candidate HIV-1 vaccines, ensuring that resources are focused on the most promising candidates. Vaccine designers must now develop T cell vaccine strategies that reduce viral load after heterologous challenge."
6697,0.003,3.0,"Plasmodium falciparum malaria and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 adversely interact in the context of pregnancy, however little is known regarding the influence of co-infection on the risk of congenital malaria. We aimed to determine the prevalence of placental and congenital malaria and impact of HIV co-infection on trans-placental malaria transmission in 157 parturient women and their infants by microscopy and by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in western Kenya. The prevalence of placental and cord blood infections were 17.2% and 0% by microscopy, and 33.1% and 10.8% by PCR. HIV co-infection was associated with a significant increase in placental parasite density (P < 0.05). Cord blood malaria prevalence was increased in co-infected women (odds ratio [OR] = 5.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.90-15.47) and correlated with placental parasite density (OR = 2.57; 95% CI = 1.80-3.67). A 1-log increase in placental monocyte count was associated with increased risk of congenital infection (P = 0.001) (OR = 48.15; 95% CI = 4.59-505.50). The HIV co-infected women have a significantly increased burden of placental malaria that increases the risk of congenital infection."

2343,0.003,3.0,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in chronic hepatitis C patient. However, its significance and consequences are still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of occult HBV among HCV chronic carriers in France and to assess its impact on liver histology and response to antiviral therapy. To this end a cohort of 203 patients with chronic hepatitis C without hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has been examined. Serum HBV-DNA was detected using a highly sensitive PCR with primers located in the S and X genes. HBV viraemia levels were further determined by real-time PCR. Results showed that 47 of 203 (23%) patients had occult HBV infection with a low HBV load (10(2)-10(4) copies/ml) but significantly higher HCV-RNA titers (P < 0.05). No significant difference in age, gender, serum ALT level, HCV genotypes, and the presence of anti-HBc was observed between patients with or without HBV-DNA. When compared histologically, patients with occult HBV infection had higher activity (A2-A3 in 53% vs. 38%, P < 0.01) and more advanced fibrosis (60% vs. 33%, P < 0.001) than HBV-DNA negative cases. Sustained response to combination therapy against Chronic hepatitis C was achieved in 11 (28%) of 40 HBV-DNA positive cases, compared with 65 (45%) of the 144 HBV-DNA negative cases (P < 0.05). Among the 144 HBV-DNA negative HCV patients those with genotype 1 responded less frequently to therapy as compared to other genotypes infected patients (38% vs. 55%, P < 0.05). Surprisingly, when considering all patients studied, irrespective to the HBV-DNA status no significant difference was observed in response to combination therapy regarding HCV genotypes (39% vs. 44%, P > 0.05). In conclusion, HBV-DNA is found in 1/4 of French chronic hepatitis C patients regardless of the presence of anti-HBc. Such an occult HBV co-infection is associated with more severe liver disease, higher HCV viral load and decreased response to antiviral therapy irrespective of HCV genotypes."
8654,0.003,3.0,"Bevirimat [3-O-(3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl)betulinic acid] is the first in a new class of anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drugs that inhibit viral maturation by specifically blocking cleavage of the Gag capsid (CA) precursor, CA-SP1, to mature CA protein, resulting in defective core condensation and release of immature noninfectious virions. Four cohorts of six HIV-infected adults, with CD4 counts of >200 and plasma viral loads of 5,000 to 250,000 transcripts/ml and not currently receiving antiretroviral therapy, were randomized to receive a single oral dose of placebo, 75, 150, or 250 mg of bevirimat. Thirty blood samples for drug concentrations and 20 HIV RNA measures were collected from each subject over a 20-day period. Candidate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models were fit to individual subjects by maximum likelihood followed by Bayesian estimation; model discrimination was by corrected Akaike's Information Criterion. The bevirimat pharmacokinetics was well described by an oral two-compartment linear model (r(2), 0.98), with a mean (percent coefficient of variation) half-life of 60.3 (13.6) h and apparent oral clearance of bevirimat from the plasma compartment of 0.17 (18) liters/h. HIV RNA was modeled as being produced in infected CD4 cells, with bevirimat inhibiting infection of new CD4 cells thru a Hill-type function (r(2), 0.87). Single oral doses of bevirimat were well tolerated and demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in viral load. The average maximum reduction from baseline following the 150- and 250-mg doses was greater than 0.45 log(10), with individual patients having reductions of greater than 0.7 log(10). No bevirimat resistance mutations were detected during the course of the study."

Of the 139 patients screened, 42 patients were included in the prospective intervention group. A total of 27 interventions were made on 15 patients, and 24 recommendations (89%) were accepted by providers.

308,0.003,3.0,"Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials were recorded in 35 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive subjects from the Centers for Disease Control groups III and IV, 24 HIV-negative drug abusers, and 62 normal healthy controls. None of the patients had evidence of neurological complications. History of alcohol consumption was an exclusion criterion. The values of central conduction times I-V and III-V showed significant differences between the HIV-seropositive subjects and normal healthy controls, as well as between the HIV-seropositive subjects and HIV-negative drug abusers. Central conduction times I-III showed no differences between groups, except in the left ear of Centers for Disease Control group IV compared with controls. No statistical differences were found in the central conduction times between HIV-negative drug abusers and normal healthy controls. The results suggest a subclinical involvement of the upper brain stem in HIV infection. It could be produced by direct action of the virus on central nervous system structures."
5500,0.003,3.0,"Significant decrease in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vertical transmission has been observed worldwide in centers where interventions such as antiretroviral therapy (ART), elective cesarean section, and avoidance of breastfeeding have been implemented. This prospective cohort study aimed to assess the determinants of and the temporal trends in HIV-1 vertical transmission in the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte, Brazil from January 1998 to December 2005. The rate of HIV-1 vertical transmission decreased from 20% in 1998 to 3% in 2005. This decline was associated with increased use of more complex ART regimens during pregnancy. Multivariate analysis restricted to clinical variables demonstrated that non ART, neonatal respiratory distress/sepsis and breastfeeding were independently associated with HIV-1 vertical transmission. When laboratory parameters were included in the model, high maternal viral load and non maternal ART were associated with HIV-1 vertical transmission. The results from this study confirm the impact of ART in the reduction of HIV-1 vertical transmission and indicate the need for improvement in the care and monitoring of mother and infant pairs affected by HIV-1."

PBMC from HIV-1-infected persons with low viremia (n=17), exposed uninfected persons (n=23), and HIV-2-infected Senegalese prostitutes (n=9) were significantly resistant to HIV-1BaL and/or HIV-1MN (P<.001). Among 34 HIV vaccine recipients of live canarypox vector expressing multiple HIV-1 gene products with or without rgp120 booster, PBMC from postvaccination samples were significantly resistant to both strains (P<.001), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor-positive samples were significantly more resistant than were precursor-negative samples (P<.03). This is the first evidence of the induction by vaccination of a validated correlate of protection.

9087,0.003,3.0,"CD8+ T cells infiltrate brains with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) encephalitis (HIVE) and related animal models; their perineuronal localization suggests cytotoxic T cell (CTL)-mediated neuronal killing. Because CTLs have not been identified in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) brains, the authors identified their cytotoxic granules in autopsy AIDS brains with HIVE and without HIVE (HIVnE) plus controls (7 to 13 cases/group) and determined gene expression profiles of CTL-associated genes in a separate series of cases. CD3+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly increased (P < .01) in perivascular spaces and inflammatory nodules in HIVE but were rare or absent in brain parenchyma in HIVnE and control brains. Eight HIVE brains contained granzyme B+ T cells and five contained perforin+ T cells. Their T-cell origin was confirmed by colocalization of CD8 and granzyme B in the same cell and the absence of CD56+ natural killer cells. The CTLs directly contacted with neurons, as the authors showed previously for CD3+ and CD8+ T cells. CTLs were rare or absent in HIV nonencephalitis (HIVnE) and controls. Granzyme B and H precursor gene expression was up-regulated and interleukin (IL)-12A precursor, a maturation factor for natural killer cells and CTLs, was down-regulated in HIVE versus HIVnE brain. This study demonstrates, for the first time, CTLs in HIVE and shows that parenchymal T cells and CTLs are sensitive biomarkers for HIVE. Consequently, CD8+ T cells and CTLs could mediate brain injury in HIVE and may represent an important biomarker for productive brain infection by HIV-1."
1010,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) establishes a persistent infection in humans and chimpanzees despite the presence of virus-specific, class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the liver. The data presented here demonstrate that CTLs directed against a conserved epitope in the HCV nonstructural 3 protein persist in the liver of a chronically infected chimpanzee for at least 2 years after infection. However, these CTLs did not recognize the HCV quasi-species present in the plasma of this animal at week 16 postinfection or at later time points. Escape from the CTL response was facilitated by an aspartic acid to glutamic acid (D-->E) substitution at amino acid position 1449 in all HCV genomes that were sequenced. The results of this study strongly support the concept that CTL responses can select for variant viruses with an enhanced ability to persist in a host and have important implications for the design of vaccines against HCV."
6259,0.003,3.0,"A prognostic scoring tool (PST) was created to aid prediction of outcome from HIV-associated Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) using data obtained from 577 episodes of PCP among 540 patients presenting to a specialist HIV treatment centre in London, UK. It used risk factors identifiable at/soon after hospitalization, previously identified as being associated with mortality: repeat episode of PCP, patient's age, haemoglobin (Hb) and oxygen partial pressure (PaO(2)) on admission, presence of medical co-morbidity (Comorb) and of pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma (PKS). The derived PST was 25.5+(age in years/10) + 2 (if a repeat episode of PCP) + 3 (if Comorb present) + 4 (if PKS detected) - PaO(2) (kPa) - Hb (g/dL), and produced scores that ranged between 0 and 19. Patients were divided into five groups according to their prognostic score: 0-3.9 = group 1 (0% mortality), 4-7.9 = group 2 (3% mortality), 8-10.9 = group 3 (9% mortality), 11-14.9 = group 4 (29% mortality) and ≥ 15 = group 5 (52% mortality). This PST facilitates rapid identification of patients early in their hospitalization who have mild or severe HIV-associated PCP and who are at high and low risk of in-hospital death from PCP. The PST may aid assessment of severity of illness and in directing treatment strategies, but requires validation in patient cohorts from other health-care institutions."
7065,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a serious risk as a disease that can be spread through blood transfusion. Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) is defined in a patient with the presence of HBV-DNA but a lack of HBsAg in the serum and hepatocytes. OBI can be considered as a high potential risk factor for inducing post transfusion hepatitis (PTH), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cirrhosis, and reactivation of the HBV. Recently, several investigations from various regions of the world have reported PTH as well as HCC and cirrhosis among blood recipients with diseases such as thalassemia and other disorders requiring regular hemodialysis. This form of hepatitis also causes complications for individuals that are co-infected with other viruses such as HCV and HIV. Because of its extreme disease potential, OBI can be considered a high risk for PTH, HCC, and cirrhosis. Therefore, an understanding of the prevalence of OBI among blood donors is a critical strategy in most transfusion services. This review addresses the recent information regarding the prevalence of OBI worldwide, with an additional focus on Iranian blood donors."

Although studies have shown that individuals with serious mental illness experience less adequate care and worse physical health outcomes than comparable patients without serious mental illness, little is known about HIV care among individuals with serious mental illness who become infected with HIV. In the present study, we describe patterns of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) use and physician monitoring received by 154 patients with serious mental illness infected with HIV. Participants were recruited from mental health agencies in Los Angeles, California. Data from 762 HIV-only patients from a separate Western U.S. probability sample were used for comparison. High proportions of serious mental illness patients with HIV in our sample appeared to be receiving adequate HIV care. Fifty-one percent of all serious mental illness patients with serious mental illness with HIV were taking HAART, and the majority received close monitoring of their CD4 counts (84%) and viral loads (82%) throughout a 1-year period. HAART use and patterns of CD4 count and viral load monitoring did not differ significantly between patients with both serious mental illness and HIV, and patients with HIV only (all p > 0.05). Specialized programs providing assistance to serious mental illness populations with HIV may be helping to narrow health care disparities as a result of having serious mental illness."

2683,0.003,3.0,"The randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III DUET studies enrolled treatment-experienced, HIV-1-infected patients. We examined the genotypic and phenotypic changes at endpoint relative to baseline, including the emergence of individual reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations, in patients who received the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) etravirine and experienced virologic failure by rebound by the time of the Week 96 analysis. Patients received etravirine 200 mg twice-daily in combination with a background regimen containing darunavir/ritonavir, investigator-selected nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and optional enfuvirtide. Virologic failure by rebound occurred in 93 (15.5%) etravirine-treated patients (compared with 170 [28.1%] placebo-treated patients). Patients experiencing virologic failure had more baseline antiretroviral resistance and lower activity of the background regimen relative to those not experiencing failure. Emergence of NNRTI resistance-associated mutations was observed in 55 of 93 patients. The most frequently emerging RT mutations were V179F, V179I, and Y181C, with positions K101 and E138 also showing frequent changes. Mutations usually emerged in a background of multiple other NNRTI mutations and were, in most cases, associated with a decrease in phenotypic sensitivity to etravirine at endpoint. Further analysis is needed to clarify the role of mutations at position 138 as determinants of etravirine resistance."

We quantified the impact of HIV treatment on employment status among HIV patients in rural South Africa who were enrolled in a public-sector HIV treatment program supported by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. We linked clinical data from more than 2,000 patients in the treatment program with ten years of longitudinal socioeconomic data from a complete community-based population cohort of more than 30,000 adults residing in the clinical catchment area. We estimated the employment effects of HIV treatment in fixed-effects regressions. Four years after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, employment among HIV patients had recovered to about 90 percent of baseline rates observed in the same patients three to five years before they started treatment. Many patients initiated treatment early enough that they were able to avoid any loss of employment due to HIV. These results represent the first estimates of employment recovery among HIV patients in a general population, relative to the employment levels that these patients had prior to job-threatening HIV illness and the decision to seek care. There are large economic benefits to HIV treatment. For some patients, further gains could be obtained from initiating antiretroviral therapy earlier, prior to HIV-related job loss."
8555,0.003,3.0,"Recent studies have indicated that the support of close relatives is fundamental in coping with HIV/AIDS and in accessing the emotional and material support necessary for sustained adherence to treatment. Because disclosure to family members is imperative to ensure their support, identifying tools or resources that can minimize the possible risks and maximize the potential benefits of disclosure should be useful in improving the lives of people living with HIV/AIDS. Where health systems require strengthening, engaging the community in HIV/AIDS care could potentially create an environment that encourages disclosure to family members. This study investigated the impact of community support initiatives (community health workers and treatment support groups), patient characteristics (age, gender, and education), and time since first diagnosis on the disclosure of serostatus to family members by a sample of 268 public-sector antiretroviral treatment patients in a province of South Africa between August 2004 and July 2007. Whereas gender, age, and education only weakly influenced disclosure, there was a strong and stable positive association between community support and disclosure to family members. The immediate and long-term impact of community support on the disclosure by seropositive patients to family members indicates that initiatives such as community health workers and HIV support groups run by people living with HIV/AIDS should be strengthened, especially for those patients who cannot disclose their status to immediate family and close friends."

These subjects were 7-17 years old and were found during a survey for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in three elementary schools, a junior high, and a senior high school. None of these carriers had clinical manifestations, although one-third of them had elevated serum alanine aminotransferase levels. All were HBeAg-positive by radioimmunoassay (RIA), and 6 of them had preserved titers of anti-HBe at the same time. Precore mutations were found in 4 subjects (18.2%), with predominance of the wild type. Although 3 of these 4 had preserved titers of HBeAb, the other had no HBeAb titers. In an other 3 subjects with preserved titers of HBeAb, the precore mutation was not detected, even after the subcloning of viral DNA. The remaining 15 subjects with HBeAg showed no precore mutation. Subjects with ALT levels exceeding 100 IU/l were all HBeAg-positive without the mutation. It was clear that the precore mutation itself occurred in the subjects at an early age during the course of infection. However, the chronological relationship between the emergence of the precore mutation and the onset of hepatitis requires further study."

This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of HIV infection among Tuberculosis (TB) confirmed patients on admission at a TB referral centre. The association of HIV prevalence with gender and age as risk factors was also determined. Blood samples were collected by venipuncture from 257 TB patients and their HIV status determined. Viral antibody detection was carried out using ELISA kits which detected both HIV-1 and HIV-2 and confirmed by Western blot. Of the 257 patients screened, 44.20% (106) were HIV positive. The prevalence of co-infection was higher among the female (44.82%) than the male (38.30%) patients and highest among those aged 21-40 years old (45.30%). Co-infection was found to be statistically highly associated with gender and age (p<0.05). A very high prevalence of HIV infection was reported in this study among patients that were on admission on the grounds that they had only TB. It is therefore important to screen for HIV among all TB patients."
7596,0.003,3.0,"National estimates of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and adherence support services utilization are needed to inform efforts to improve the health of HIV-infected persons in the United States. In a nationally representative sample of HIV-infected adults receiving medical care, 86% self-reported taking all ART doses in the past 72 hours. Overall, 20% reported using adherence support services and 2% reported an unmet need for services. If all nonadherent persons not receiving adherence support and all persons with a self-perceived unmet need for adherence support accessed services, resources to support ∼42,673 additional persons would be needed. Factors associated with lower adherence included younger age, female gender, depression, stimulant use, binge alcohol use, greater than once-daily dosing, longer time since HIV diagnosis, and patient beliefs. Predictors of adherence are multifactorial so multiple targeted strategies to improve adherence are warranted. Providing adherence support services to all those in need may require additional resources. "
6168,0.003,3.0,"This study examined the relationship of adherence to antiretroviral treatment with three types of social support (partner, friends, and family) and use of two coping strategies (denial and substance use). Participants were 73 men and women with HIV infection drawn from a larger sample of 186 clinical trial patients. Based on inclusion criteria, parent trial participants taking antiretroviral therapies, and those with complete data on self-reported measures of adherence were considered eligible for the present study. Overall, 26% of participants were found to be nonadherent, which was defined as one or more missed doses of treatment in the prior 4-day period. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine associations of sociodemographic and psychosocial variables with adherence to antiretroviral regimen. Results indicated that heterosexual participants (p < 0.01) and participants of Latino ethnicity (p < 0.05) were significantly more likely to report missed medications. Perceived satisfaction with support from a partner was associated with taking antiretroviral therapy as prescribed, whereas satisfaction with support from friends and from family was not significantly related to adherence. Examination of coping strategies showed that participants reporting drug and alcohol use (p <.05) to cope with HIV-related stress were more likely to be nonadherent. These findings call for adherence interventions designed to address barriers and strengths, such as community norms or traditional cultural values, specific to certain populations. Furthermore, couple-based approaches enlisting partner support may help persons living with HIV to adhere to antiretroviral regimens."

For an interstitial pneumopathy, the sensitivity was the same but the specificity was 100%. During a one year period, the prevalence of PCP in our department was 69%. The positive and negative predictive values of increased LDH levels in HIV-infected patients were, respectively: 92 and 63% for bronchopneumopathy, and 100 and 73% for interstitial pneumopathy. Furthermore, the lowering and then the normalization of the LDH value were observed in all PCP cases with a favorable outcome. This simple yet highly sensitive laboratory analysis should be used for the diagnosis and monitoring of all bronchopneumopathies in HIV-infected patients."

6288,0.003,3.0,"Zidovudine is widely prescribed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Trimethoprim and dapsone are commonly used in the management of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in HIV-infected patients. To examine the pharmacokinetic interactions among these drugs, eight HIV-infected patients (26 to 43 years old) with a mean CD4 count of 524.4 +/- 405.7 cells per mm3 received zidovudine (200 mg), trimethoprim (200 mg), and dapsone (100 mg) as single agents and in two- and three-drug combinations. Blood and urine samples were collected at a specified time and analyzed for zidovudine, zidovudine-glucuronide, trimethoprim, dapsone, and monoacetyl-dapsone concentrations under single-dose and steady-state conditions. Zidovudine did not influence the pharmacokinetic disposition of dapsone or trimethoprim. Dapsone had no effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of zidovudine. Trimethoprim significantly decreased the renal clearance of zidovudine by 58% (5.0 +/- 1.8 versus 2.1 +/- 0.5 ml/min/kg of body weight [P < 0.05]). There was a concurrent 54% decrease in the mean urinary recovery of zidovudine (11.7 +/- 3.5 versus 5.4 +/- 3.0 [P < 0.05]), and the metabolic ratio was decreased by 78% (0.32 +/- 0.4 versus 0.07 +/- 0.05 [P < 0.05]). The mean area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 6 h of the zidovudine-glucuronide/ zidovudine ratio was unchanged. We conclude that zidovudine, trimethoprim, and dapsone can be coadministered to patients with AIDS without significant pharmacokinetic interaction. However, in AIDS patients with liver impairment and impaired glucuronidation, doses of zidovudine may need to be decreased."
9487,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is one of the most prominent health care challenges world wide. In Western industrialized countries where common access to antiretroviral drugs exists, HIV infection is a well treatable disease in the long-term for most patients. However, given the possible evolution of drug-resistance, the right combination of antiretroviral drugs in first-line therapy is crucial for maintaining long-term success. For each individual patient, the ideal time to start antiretroviral therapy must be carefully selected. The individual risk of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) on the one hand, and the risks of long-term toxicity and adherence problems under therapy on the other hand must be taken into account. Each patient should be counseled according to present treatment guidelines on when and how to start HAART, taking into account the surrogate markers CD4-cell count and HIV-RNA as well as clinically apparent HIV-associated disease."

In this study, urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8OH2'dG), a metabolite of oxidized DNA, was measured to determine if antiretroviral therapy leads to oxidative damage to DNA. A cross-sectional study was carried out measuring urinary 8OH2'dG in three groups of HIV-infected patients: (1) antiretroviral medication naïve, (2) patients on antiretroviral medications without lipodystrophy and (3) patients on antiretroviral medications with lipodystrophy. Twenty-five patients were enrolled in each group. The mean spot urinary 8OH2'dG measurements per mg creatinine for the three groups were: antiretroviral naïve 4.27 +/- 0.61 (ng 8OH2'dG/mg creatinine +/- SEM), on antiretroviral medications without lipodystrophy 2.88 +/- 0.26, and on antiretroviral medications with lipodystrophy 3.27 +/- 0.30.

7794,0.003,3.0,"Studies examining the sex differences in morbidity and mortality among HIV/AIDS patients have yielded inconsistent results. We conducted a meta-analysis of sex differences in disease progression and mortality among HIV/AIDS patients. Medical literature databases from inception to August 2014 were searched for published observational studies assessing sex differences in immunologic and virologic response, disease progression and mortality among HIV-infected patients. Random effects meta-analyses of 115 eligible studies were conducted to obtain pooled estimates of outcomes and heterogeneity was explored in sub-group analyses. Pooled estimates showed an increased risk of progression to AIDS (relative risk [RR]=1.11,95% CI=1.02-1.21) and all-cause mortality (RR=1.23, 95% CI=1.17-1.29) among males compared to females. All-cause mortality differed by sex only in low and middle income countries. The risk of AIDS-related mortality (RR=1.03, 95% CI=0.82-1.30), immunologic failure (RR=1.19,95% CI: 0.97-1.47), virologic suppression (RR=0.98, 95% CI=0.84-1.14), virologic failure (RR=1.26, 95% CI=0.99-1.61) and the change in CD4 cell count (Weighted mean difference [WMD] = -5.15, 95% CI= -13.57 to 3.28) did not differ by sex. These findings were modified by disease severity, adherence and use of highly active antiretroviral therapy. We conclude that HIV-related disease progression and survival outcomes are poorer in males. "
6088,0.003,3.0,"Drug toxicity and viral resistance limit the long-term efficacy of antiviral drug treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Thus, alternative therapies need to be explored. We tested the infusion of T lymphocytes transduced with a retroviral vector (M87o) that expresses an HIV entry-inhibitory peptide (maC46). Gene-modified autologous T cells were infused into ten HIV-infected patients with advanced disease and multidrug-resistant virus during anti-retroviral combination therapy. T-cell infusions were tolerated well, with no severe side effects. A significant increase of CD4 counts was observed after infusion. At the end of the 1-year follow-up, the CD4 counts of all patients were still around or above baseline. Gene-modified cells could be detected in peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow throughout the 1-year follow-up, and marking levels correlated with the cell dose. No significant changes of viral load were observed during the first 4 months. Four of the seven patients who changed their antiviral drug regimen thereafter responded with a significant decline in plasma viral load. In conclusion, the transfer of gene-modified cells was safe, led to sustained levels of gene marking, and may improve immune competence in HIV-infected patients with advanced disease and multidrug-resistant virus."
9442,0.003,3.0,"The early successes of highly active anti-retroviral therapies (HAART) for the treatment of HIV-1-infection and AIDS have raised the question as to whether there is a legitimate role for gene therapy in the treatment of this chronic infectious disease. However, in many patients the profound suppression of viral replication is short lived, particularly if patients have been treated with sequential monotherapies in the past, have been infected with a highly drug resistant isolate of HIV-1, or have temporarily discontinued therapy as a ""holiday"" or because of drug intolerance. In addition, life-long adherence to maintenance HAART will probably be required even in responding patients with undetectable viremia because of the reservoirs of latently infected cells that can persist for years. Gene therapy through the introduction of anti-retroviral ""resistance"" genes into CD4(+) T cells is one approach that could give long term protection to these HIV-1 susceptible cells in vivo. We have explored this approach by developing intrabodies to the critical HIV-1 transactivator protein, Tat that is absolutely required for HIV-1 replication. This provocative treatment approach, that will be tested in a clinical gene therapy trial, sets the groundwork for determining if anti-Tat intrabody gene therapy together with HAART can provide a treatment strategy for the immune reconstitution of HIV-1-infected patients with advanced disease."

Existing control strategies are unlikely to curtail these diseases in the absence of efficacious vaccines. Testing of HIV and malaria vaccines candidates start with early phase trials that are increasingly being conducted in developing countries where the burden of the diseases is high. Unique challenges, which affect planning and implementation of vaccine trials according to internationally accepted standards have thus been identified. In this review, we highlight specific challenges encountered during two early phase trials of novel HIV-1 and malaria vectored vaccine candidates conducted in The Gambia and how some of these issues were pragmatically addressed. We hope our experience will be useful for key study personnel involved in day-to-day running of similar clinical trials. It may also guide future design and implementation of vaccine trials in resource-constrained settings."
3214,0.003,3.0,"The prevalence of occult hepatitis B, defined by absence of HBsAg and HBV DNA, ranges widely in patients with hepatitis C. This may influence the treatment of hepatitis C and the severity of liver disease. Sensitive and specific real-time PCR techniques are available commercially and can detect more reliably low HBV DNA levels. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus infection using the COBAS Taqman assay (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) in the serum and liver of HBsAg negative patients with chronic hepatitis C and to evaluate its clinical consequences on liver pathology and its impact on the response to treatment with peg-IFNalpha and Ribavirin. HBV DNA detection was assessed retrospectively on 140 sera and 113 liver biopsies of HCV positive/HBsAg negative patients before treatment. A 4.4% (5/113) prevalence of occult hepatitis B was recorded in liver samples and in none of the sera. Anti-HBc was not detected in one, three of whom were sustained virological responders to treatment, one was relapsed responder and one was non-responder. Furthermore, in this cohort composed of 12% anti-HBs negative/anti-HBc positive and 20% anti-HBs positive/anti-HBc positive patients, anti-HBc was not associated with pre-therapeutic viral load, ALT serum levels, and histological activity or fibrosis. Using a commercial real-time PCR assay, we observed a low prevalence of occult B hepatitis. This, just as anti-HBC status, had no clinical impact in a large cohort of hepatitis C patients. It therefore does not appear useful to screen for occult hepatitis B in these patients with this test before beginning HCV treatment."

Herein, we report the main clinical and virological features of cases reported in Spain. All individuals with HTLV-1 infection recorded at the national registry since 1989 were examined. Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on the long terminal repeat (LTR) region. A total of 229 HTLV-1 cases had been reported up to December 2012. The mean age was 41 years old and 61% were female. Their country of origin was Latin America in 59%, Africa in 15%, and Spain in 20%. Transmission had occurred following sexual contact in 41%, parenteral exposure in 12%, and vertically in 9%. HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) was diagnosed in 27 cases and adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in 17 subjects. HTLV-1 subtype could be obtained for 45 patients; all but one belonged to the Cosmopolitan subtype a. One Nigerian pregnant woman harbored HTLV-1 subtype b. Within the Cosmopolitan subtype a, two individuals (from Bolivia and Peru, respectively) belonged to the Japanese subgroup B, another two (from Senegal and Mauritania) to the North African subgroup D, and 39 to the Transcontinental subgroup A. Of note, one divergent HTLV-1 strain from an Ethiopian branched off from all five known Cosmopolitan subtype 1a subgroups. Divergent HTLV-1 strains have been introduced and currently circulate in Spain. The relatively large proportion of symptomatic cases (19%) suggests that HTLV-1 infection is underdiagnosed in Spain."
7557,0.003,3.0,"To investigate the pathogenic role of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) among human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons, 111 outpatients with and 68 without diarrhea were evaluated. Examination of stool samples included the HeLa cell adherence assay and an EAggEC polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using primers complementary for the plasmid locus CVD432. The pCVD432 genotype, adherence phenotype, and patient characteristics were correlated with occurrence of diarrhea by multivariate analyses. EAggEC PCR and adherence assays were positive in 7 (6%) and 24 (22%) patients with diarrhea and in 1 (1%) and 21 (31%) asymptomatic control patients, respectively. Clinical manifestations associated with EAggEC PCR-positive isolates were nonspecific; EAggEC infections were independent of CD4 lymphocyte counts. Of the pCVD432 genotype, 5 (71%) of 7 were resistant to cotrimoxazole and ampicillin, and 1 strain was resistant to ciprofloxacin. Overall, pCVD432 PCR-positive E. coli was the most prevalent intestinal organism associated with diarrhea. The adherence assay results did not correlate with diarrhea."
1102,0.003,3.0,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in innate immunity against pathogens. Their stimulation induces the activation of NF-κB, an important inducer of HIV-1 replication. In recent years, an increasing number of studies using several cells types from HIV-infected patients indicate that TLRs play a key role in regulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and viral pathogenesis. In the present study, the effect of HIV-1 stimulation of monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subpopulations from healthy donors on the expression and functions of TLR2 and TLR4 was examined. In addition, and to complete the in vitro study, the expression pattern of TLR2 and TLR4 in 49 HIV-1-infected patients, classified according to viral load and the use of HAART, was determined and compared with 25 healthy subjects. An increase of TLR expression and production of proinflammatory cytokines were observed in MDMs and PBMCs infected with HIV-1 in vitro and in response to TLR stimulation, compared to the mock. In addition, an association between TLR expression and up-regulation of CD80 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) was observed. The ex vivo analysis indicated increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), but only of TLR2 in monocytes obtained from HIV-1-infected patients, compared to healthy subjects. Remarkably, the expression was higher in cells from patients who do not use HAART. In monocytes, there was a positive correlation between both TLRs and viral load, but not CD4(+) T cell numbers. Together, our in vitro and ex vivo results suggest that TLR expression and function can be up-regulated in response to HIV-1 infection and could affect the inflammatory response. We propose that modulation of TLRs represents a mechanism to promote HIV-1 replication or AIDS progression in HIV-1-infected patients."
9671,0.003,3.0,"Even though potent antiretrovirals are available against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection, therapy fails in a significant fraction of patients. Among the most relevant reasons for treatment failure are drug toxicity and side effects, but also the development of viral resistance towards the drugs applied. Efflux by ATP-binding cassette (ABC-) transporters represents one major mechanism influencing the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs and particularly their distribution, thus modifiying the concentration within the infected cells, that is, at the site of action. Moreover, drug-drug interactions may occur at the level of these transporters and modulate their activity or expression thus influencing the efficacy and toxicity of the substrate drugs. This review summarizes current knowledge on the interaction of antiretrovirals used for HIV-1 therapy with ABC-transporters and highlights the impact of ABC-transporters for cellular resistance and therapeutic success. Moreover, the suitability of different cell models for studying the interaction of antiretrovirals with ABC-transporters is discussed."
9396,0.003,3.0,"Recent studies have shown that a single-nucleotide polymorphism upstream of the interleukin-28B (IL28B) gene plays a major role in predicting therapeutic response in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin. We sought to investigate the mechanism of the IL28B polymorphism, specifically as it relates to early HCV viral kinetics, IFN pharmacokinetics, IFN pharmacodynamics, and gene expression profiles. Two prospective cohorts (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected) completing treatment with IFN/ribavirin were enrolled. Patients were genotyped at the polymorphic site rs12979860. In the HIV/HCV cohort, frequent serum sampling was completed for HCV RNA and IFN levels. DNA microarray of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and individual expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were quantified on IFN therapy. The IL28B-favorable (CC) genotype was associated with improved therapeutic response compared with unfavorable (CT or TT) genotypes. Patients with a favorable genotype had greater first- and second-phase viral kinetics (P = 0.004 and P = 0.036, respectively), IFN maximum antiviral efficiency (P = 0.007) and infected cell death loss (P = 0.009) compared with unfavorable genotypes. Functional annotation analysis of DNA microarray data was consistent with depressed innate immune function, particularly of natural killer cells, from patients with unfavorable genotypes (P <0.004). Induction of innate immunity genes was also lower in unfavorable genotypes. ISG expression at baseline and induction with IFN was independent of IL28B genotype."
3078,0.003,3.0,"To examine whether recent intravenous use of cocaine might be associated with increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection, the authors studied 2,597 active intravenous drug users: 2,399 with recent cocaine injection and 198 with recent injection of heroin or other drugs but not cocaine. These subjects were adult residents of Baltimore City and the surrounding Maryland counties, recruited via outreach into the community between February 1988 and March 1989. In contrast to the first report on the cocaine-HIV association, the present study sample was not recruited solely from drug treatment programs. In the present study, estimated HIV seroprevalence was 26.4% for recent cocaine injectors as compared with 10.6% among all other recent intravenous drug users; the relative odds estimate was 3.03. In the untreated segment of the sample, HIV seroprevalence was 26.0% for recent cocaine injectors as compared with 8.9% among others (relative odds (RO) = 3.61). The estimated degree of association did not change appreciably when multiple logistic regression was used to hold constant potentially confounding and/or mediating variables such as receptive anal intercourse, number of sex partners, and use of injection equipment obtained at shooting galleries (RO = 2.64). Augmenting these cross-sectional data, preliminary prospective data showed excess risk of HIV seroconversion among recent cocaine injectors (estimated relative risk = 2.11). While other research has examined the cocaine-HIV association, the present study differs in that it has allowed a test for whether the association was a spurious artifact of studying drug users recruited solely from drug treatment programs, a broad array of alternative determinants of HIV infection have been held constant, and the association has been examined with seroconversion data. The results lend support to the abiding concern about the risk of HIV infection among cocaine users."

3101,0.003,3.0,"Reciprocal interactions between HIV and HAV or HBV can increase risk of morbidity and mortality in HIV disease and/or worsened the natural course of the hepatitis viruses. Hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for HIV infected patients at risk for exposure or severe disease: men who have sex with men, injecting drug users, patients with chronic liver disease and patients traveling in high endemic countries. As for healthy adults the scheme of vaccination is two doses 6 or 12 mo apart, nevertheless, seroconversion rates are lower. A third dose could improve the seroconversion rates. Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all HIV infected persons lacking prior immunity. As the immune response to hepatitis B vaccines is impaired in HIV-infected adults, four double doses of hepatitis B vaccine could enhance serological response. To assume a higher immune response, vaccines should be administered in HIV-infected patients with undetectable HIV viral load and high CD4 cell count."
9443,0.003,3.0,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) policy for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has historically been based on clinical indications, such as opportunistic infections and CD4 cell counts. Studies suggest that CD4 counts early in HIV infection do not predict relevant public health outcomes such as disease progression, mortality, and HIV transmission in people living with HIV. CD4 counts also vary widely within individuals and among populations, leading to imprecise measurements and arbitrary ART initiation. To capture the clinical and preventive benefits of treatment, the global HIV response now focuses on increasing HIV diagnosis and ART coverage. CD4 counts for ART initiation were necessary when medications were expensive and had severe side effects, and when the impact of early ART initiation was unclear. However, current evidence suggests that although CD4 counts may still play a role in guiding clinical care to start prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, CD4 counts should cease to be required for ART initiation."
8481,0.003,3.0,"Behaviors associated with transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were measured in a sample of 60 adults with a severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI). Results revealed that 68% had sex in the last year; 13% of men and 30% of women reported two or more male partners, and 24% of men also reported two or more female partners. Condom use was inconsistent. Sex partners were often met in a psychiatric clinic or bar, and a substantial number were injection drug users or known to be non-monogamous. Overall, 48% of men and 37% of women reported at least one risk factor. Hypothesized psychological antecedents of HIV-related risk behavior were also measured, including knowledge, motivation for risk reduction, and self-efficacy regarding risk-reduction. Many participants were misinformed regarding HIV-transmission and risk reduction. Motivational indices indicated that attitudes toward condoms were slightly positive, and that social norms were generally supportive of condom use. However, participants tended to rate themselves at only slight risk for infection, undermining their motivation for condom use. Participants indicated only modest levels of self-efficacy in situations requiring sexual assertiveness. These findings, coupled with the elevated seroprevalence of HIV among persons having a SPMI, point to the need for risk assessment and counseling by mental health care providers."

Bisexuals constituted 24% of the sample; the seroprevalence rate was lower for bisexuals than homosexuals (21 vs. 34%). In logistic regressions, HIV-1 seropositivity was independently related to age, education, pattern of insertive/receptive behavior in anal sex, lifetime number of male sex partners, having sex with someone with AIDS, homosexual versus bisexual behavior, and a history of condyloma. The same logistic regressions were found to fit bisexuals and homosexuals. The rate of HIV-1 was reduced in individuals who indicated always requiring their partners to use a condom when practicing receptive anal sex (1% of the total). The most common practice for both homosexuals and bisexuals was ""mixed"" behavior (i.e., both insertive and receptive anal sex); this was also the practice with the highest risk. Bisexuals practiced both vaginal and anal sex with women and reported little condom use. The substantial seroprevalence among bisexuals, their frequent sexual contact with women, and their low rate of condom use imply a continuing role as a bridge of infection to females. Whether this risk will lead to a sustained heterosexual epidemic remains to be determined."

Specific viral amplicons were identified in the same sample by their distinctive melting temperatures. The analysis of scalar concentrations of the reference samples indicated that this multiplex procedure detects at least 2500 copies/ml of HCV and 400 copies/ml of HIV-1. HIV-1 and HCV viral loads in 20 patients infected with HIV-1 and/or HCV and in 5 healthy blood donors were also tested, confirming the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.

The frequency of these parasites was higher among patients with diarrheic syndrome and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts < 200 cells/mm 3 , demonstrating the opportunistic characteristic of these infections. A significant association was observed between the lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy and the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and/or C. belli. Parasitism with Cryptosporidium spp. was more frequent in February and April, the months following the period of high rainfall. The same was not observed for C. belli. Genetic characterization of two isolates led to the identification of Cryptosporidium parvum, one of the main species associated with the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis."

487,0.003,3.0,"Twenty cases of systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in HIV-infected patients were reviewed over a 10-year-period, divided into Group A, including 13 NHL cases treated before the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, and Group B, including 7 patients who received HAART. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was performed and log-rank was applied to assess statistical differences between the groups. In group A, the median CD4 count was 36 cells/mm3. No complete remission was found. In group B, the median CD4 count was 137 cells/mm3. Four patients (57.0%) are still alive and in complete remission. Group A had a median survival of 5 months and group B 31 months (p = 0.0032). Our results are in agreement with recent reports in that a higher CD4 count and better immune status achieved with HAART is predictive of a better outcome. We found that HAART in combination with chemotherapy improves overall survival of NHL patients without increasing adverse effects."
4579,0.003,3.0,"The development and application of nucleoside (and nucleotide) analogues for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection will transform the management of this condition. For instance, treatment with lamivudine effects a dramatic and measurable reduction of serum virus titre. This is associated with biochemical and histological improvements. Unfortunately, for the majority, replication resumes when treatment is withdrawn. Prolonged lamividine treatment may be associated with the emergence of drug-resistant species with specific polymerase mutations. Compared with the observed rate for the development of drug resistance observed during monotherapy of HIV infection, resistance is slow to emerge during treatment of hepatitis B. The rate of emergence might be dependent on the rate of infected hepatocyte turnover, which is extremely variable in chronic HBV infection (and significantly slower than infected lymphocyte turnover during HIV infection). Preliminary data suggest that pretreatment serum virus titre may be an important predictor of the development of drug resistance, an observation consistent with preexistance of the resistant virus in the hepatitis B virus quasispecies. Akin to developments in antiviral treatment of HIV infection, further progress in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B will depend on the development of drugs for use in combination therapy."
8364,0.003,3.0,"Untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections usually lead to death from AIDS, although the rate of the disease progression varies widely among individuals. The cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, which is restricted by highly polymorphic MHC class I alleles, plays a central role in controlling HIV replication. It is now recognized that the antiviral efficacy of CTLs at the single cell level is dependent on their antigen specificity and is important in determining the quality of host response to viruses so that the individual will remain asymptomatic. However, because of the extreme mutational plasticity of HIV, HIV-specific CTL responses are continuously and dynamically changing. In order to rationally design an effective vaccine, the questions as to what constitutes an effective antiviral CTL response and what characterizes a potent antigenic peptide to induce such responses are becoming highlighted as needing to be answered."
4721,0.003,3.0,"Intestinal microsporidiosis is most commonly associated with persistent diarrhea in advanced AIDS cases. To determine the prevalence and clinical manifestations of this infection in HIV/AIDS patients, a single fresh stool sample and blood were collected from 243 (214 HIV-positive and 29 HIV-negative) diarrheal patients. The presence of intestinal microsporidiosis in the stool was determined by Uvitex-2B staining and a PCR-based detection method. HIV screening was done by using ELISA, and reactive samples were confirmed by Western blotting. The CD4+ cell count was analyzed using FACScan. Out of 243 diarrheal patients, 39 (16.0%) cases were positive for intestinal microsporidial infection by either of the methods used. Of the 39, only 18 cases positive by microscopy were also positive by PCR. Based on PCR and microscopic analyses the microsporidial parasites were identified as Enterocytozoon bieneusi (30), Ecephalitozoon intestinalis (6), and double infections (3). All microsporidia-positive cases were HIV-positive, and 92.3% had diarrhea for over 4 weeks. The diarrhea was watery in 79.5% of the patients. Weight loss >10% was recorded in 37 (94.9%) cases. The CD4+ cell count was <100 cells/mm(3) in 84.4% of subjects, and 59.4% of the patients had a CD4+ cell count of < or =50 cells/mm(3), with a mean of 22.8 cells/mm(3). This study revealed that intestinal microsporidiosis is a common cause of chronic diarrhea and severe weight loss in advanced AIDS patients in Ethiopia. This condition is attributable mainly to E. bieneusi. Thus, early diagnosis of intestinal microsporidiosis in HIV/AIDS patients would certainly be helpful in the understanding and management of diarrheal illness."

Cloning and expression of recombinant HDV antigen (rHDAg) in Escherichiacoli are described. Using purified rHDAg, a cost-effective indirect anti-HDV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was developed. Direct comparison of 15 known HDV-positive sera and 15 HDV-negative sera showed concordance agreement between the new assay kit and the Abbott Murex Anti-Delta (total) kit. In addition, 1,486 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive blood samples collected from various areas of China were tested using this indirect anti-HDV ELISA. It was found that 1.2% (95% CI: 0.7-1.9%) of the samples were anti-HDAg positive. It is suggested that the prevalence of HDV and HBV co-infection in China is relatively low."
1632,0.003,3.0,"The association of viremia, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and hepatocyte inflammatory activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients was studied. Serum samples from 114 HCC patients undergoing surgery were assayed for hepatitis B, C, and D viral nucleic acids by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prior to surgery. Of these patients, 65 had HBV infection alone, 15 had HCV infection alone, 4 had HDV infection, 20 had HBV and HCV superinfection, 1 had triple viral infection, and 9 were negative for HBV and HCV infections. The prevalence of active viral replication was significantly higher in HCV than in HBV (92% versus 70%; P = 0.006) patients, and significantly higher mean serum ALT levels were also noted in the HCV group than in the HBV group (P = 0.02). The incidence of marked ALT elevation (>200 U/l) was highest in the HCV (27%) and the HDV (25%) groups. Patients in the HCV group were 10 years older than those in the HBV group. Viral superinfection did not accelerate the development of HCC. Viral replication persisted in a significant portion of HCC patients and a higher prevalence of hepatic inflammation was noted in patients with HCV- and, possibly, HDV-related HCC."
3847,0.003,3.0,"A Retroviral Coinfection Clinic was established in 1991 at Charity Hospital Medical Center of Louisiana to study patients dually infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I, HTLV-II). Eight patients were evaluated clinically, and by immunological and virological studies. Multiple neuromuscular diseases were observed, including tropical spastic paraparesis, polymyositis, and polyneuropathies. Only one patient developed AIDS. HIV-1 infected patients with HTLV-I, but not HTLV-II, coinfection have maintained stable CD4 counts, despite the fact that quantitative HIV DNA PCR suggests a relatively high copy number. HTLV-I/II antigens were detected in lymphocyte cultures from four patients, and lymphoblastoid cell lines have been established from two. These results support the contention that upregulated HTLV-I/II virus expression and disease manifestations occur during coinfection with HIV, sometimes in association with normal CD4 counts."
4344,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is almost universal; cirrhosis develops in up to 30% of cases. Currently there is interest in the midterm outcomes of HCV patients with concomitant hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among OLT recipients. We therefore retrospectively analyzed our database of patients who underwent OLT for HCV-HBV-related cirrhosis. Between April 1992 and December 2008, 350 patients underwent OLT, including 20 (5.7%) transplanted for HBV-HCV cirrhosis. We assessed patient and graft survivals at 1 and 5 years, as well as the progression of fibrosis. Protocol liver biopsies were available yearly after OLT. The survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier approach and chronic hepatitis evaluated according to the Ishak scoring system. At a median follow-up of 68.4 +/- 53 months, the 1- and 5-year patient and graft survival rates were 80% and 70%, respectively. The 5-year fibrosis progression rate was 0.17 +/- 0.08 units of fibrosis. The only patient who developed histologic cirrhosis within 10 years of follow-up showed a lamivudine-resistant HBV recurrence. Patients transplanted for HBV-HCV coinfection showed a lower fibrosis progression rate compared with HCV monoinfected subjects."

6461,0.003,3.0,"This study was designed to provide a preliminary assessment of the occurrence of tuberculosis exposure, infection and disease within a national sample of infants and children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposure or infection, and to determine the prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates resistant both to isoniazid and rifampin in these patients or their adult source contacts. A retrospective questionnaire survey was conducted of infants and children with HIV exposure or infection evaluated by pediatric HIV referral centers in the United States comprising the pediatric units or subunits of the Pediatric Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Clinical Trials Group (PACTG). Seventy of 72 sites during a mean period of 5 (range, 1 to 12) years participated in this study and had provided care for 14,038 patients. There were 75 cumulative total cases of tuberculosis disease seen since each site was established. Therapy for asymptomatic infection was given to another 40 children and for tuberculosis exposure to 71 children. Annualized case rates were 478/100,000 for sites established in 1990 to 1992, 117/100,000 for 1988 to 1989, 63/100,000 for 1986 to 1987 and 58/100,000 for 1981 to 1985 (P = 0.05, Spearman's p test for trend). By comparison, the 1992 age-specific tuberculosis case rate for all U.S. children < 5 years was 5.5/100,000.

3005,0.003,3.0,"The TT virus (TTV) was isolated recently from the serum of a patient with post-transfusion hepatitis. TTV infection is widespread in the general population, and its prevalence increases continuously with age. The pathogenic role of TTV in liver disease remains controversial, and the source of transmission is still unclear. We investigated the pathogenicity and epidemiology of TTV infection in infants born to TTV DNA-positive mothers. Enrolled in this study were 22 mother-child pairs testing negative for antibodies to hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs). The children were followed for 30 months after birth. Serum TTV DNA was detected by N22-PCR, and the PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The prevalence of TTV infection in children increased with age. Of the 22 children, 13 (59%) became positive for TTV DNA during the follow-up period. Of these 13 children, 6 (46%) had elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), although the elevations were transient and mild. TTV viremia was not associated significantly with the abnormal ALT levels. Children with TTV viremia developed neither severe liver disease nor fulminant hepatitis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that, in 11 (85%) of the 13 pairs, the mother and child had the same genotype at the first PCR-positive time point. Among those 11 mother-child pairs, 6 (55%) had identical TTV nucleotide sequences. However, the genotype of predominant clones changed in 5 (50%) of 10 children who were positive for TTV DNA at two or more time points during the follow-up period. In conclusion, this study did not provide evidence that TTV infection is related to liver disease in children. Although the main source of TTV infection in children is presumed to be their mothers, transmitted via non-parenteral routes in the course of daily contact, intrafamilial carriers may also be sources of TTV infection."

4287,0.003,3.0,"Lamivudine is a nucleoside analog with activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Patients coinfected with HIV and HBV may have hepatitis flares when lamivudine therapy is discontinued or when resistance of HBV to lamivudine emerges. This retrospective, descriptive study conducted in three tertiary care medical centers describes patients coinfected with HIV type 1 and HBV who presented with a spectrum of clinical and subclinical hepatitic responses to lamivudine withdrawal or resistance. One patient had fulminant hepatic failure and a second patient had subclinical hepatitis when lamivudine therapy was discontinued and a more efficacious antiretroviral regimen was substituted. Three patients had flares of hepatitis after 13 to 18 months of lamivudine therapy. Lamivudine withdrawal or emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutants in patients coinfected with HIV and HBV may result in severe hepatitis. Clinicians caring for patients with coinfection with HIV and HBV should be aware of the possibility that a hepatitis B flare may occur in previously asymptomatic carrier patients."

The main characteristics found were: a young patient population (mean age 41 years old in both groups), composed in most part of male individuals (74.3% WPI and 51.4% NPI) with previous risk factors for both infections (WPI 93.2% and NPI 89.2%). The most significant findings included AIDS-defining disease (WPI 18.9% and NPI 13.5% of the cases), elevated hepatic enzyme levels (WPI: SGOT 52.1 and NPI 53.2), absence of liver disease-related symptoms (16.2% for both groups), average CD4 count > 350 for both groups (WPI 362.2 and NPI 378.1), predominantly low-grade fibrosis in both populations (0-2 in 63.6% of WPI patients and in 80% of NPI patients), with necro-inflammatory activity ranging from 5-7 in 51.3% and 42.9% of WPI patients and NPI patients, respectively. It is suggested a sequential biopsy to better evaluate the evolution of the hepatic disease, according to the HAART regimen received."
4153,0.003,3.0,"The Vif protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is important for virion infectivity. Previous studies have shown that vif-defective virions exhibit structural abnormalities in the virus core and are defective in the ability to complete proviral DNA synthesis in acutely infected cells. We developed novel assays to assess the relative stability of the core in HIV-1 virions. Using these assays, we examined the role of Vif in the stability of the HIV-1 core. The integrity of the core was examined following virion permeabilization or removal of the lipid envelope and treatment with various triggers, including S100 cytosol, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, detergents, NaCl, and buffers of different pH to mimic aspects of the uncoating and disassembly process which occurs after virus entry but preceding or during reverse transcription. vif mutant cores were more sensitive to disruption by all triggers tested than wild-type cores, as determined by endogenous reverse transcriptase (RT) assays, biochemical analyses, and electron microscopy. RT and the p7 nucleocapsid protein were released more readily from vif mutant virions than from wild-type virions, suggesting that the internal nucleocapsid is less stably packaged in the absence of Vif. Purified cores could be isolated from wild-type but not vif mutant virions by sedimentation through detergent-treated gradients. These results demonstrate that Vif increases the stability of virion cores. This may permit efficient viral DNA synthesis by preventing premature degradation or disassembly of viral nucleoprotein complexes during early events after virus entry."
4264,0.003,3.0,"Given the enormous advances in the prevention of perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), it is clear that early identification and treatment of all pregnant women with HIV is the best way to prevent neonatal infection and also improve women's health. Furthermore, new evidence suggests that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy in the course of infection is beneficial for individuals infected with HIV and reduces the rate of sexual transmission to partners who are not infected. Screening should be performed after women have been notified that HIV screening is recommended for all pregnant patients and that they will receive an HIV test as part of the routine panel of prenatal tests unless they decline (opt-out screening). Obstetrician-gynecologists or other obstetric providers should follow opt-out prenatal HIV screening where legally possible. Repeat HIV testing in the third trimester is recommended for women in areas with high HIV incidence or prevalence and women known to be at risk of acquiring HIV infection. Women who were not tested earlier in pregnancy or whose HIV status is otherwise undocumented should be offered rapid screening on labor and delivery using the opt-out approach where allowed. If a rapid HIV test result in labor is reactive, antiretroviral prophylaxis should be immediately initiated while waiting for supplemental test results. If the diagnosis of HIV infection is established, the woman should be linked into ongoing care with a specialist in HIV care for comanagement. "

8478,0.003,3.0,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of sociodemographic characteristics, patient perceptions, and patient characteristics including spirituality, self-reported adherence, and highly active antiretroviral therapy. The convenience sample consisted of 120 English-speaking adults (60% male, 35% female, 5% transgendered) with HIV/AIDS from two HIV service agencies in a large metropolitan city in the southeastern United States. The mean self-reported adherence was 83.1% (SD = 15.7%). Adherence was significantly correlated with perceived support and absence of barriers, strong intentions to adhere, perceived effectiveness of the medications, higher levels of perceived general health, fewer years of HIV disease, and fewer years on antiretroviral medications. Existential well-being (e.g., viewing life as positive and having meaning) was a weak significant correlate. Backward regression analysis was conducted to identify a parsimonious model of predictors of adherence. The final model included presence of support and absence of barriers, fewer years of HIV infection, no current alcohol use, perceived severity of HIV, existential well-being, and male gender. This model explained 19.4% of the variance in adherence (observed F[6, 100] = 5.6, p < .0001)."
6653,0.003,3.0,"In South Africa, where it is estimated that more people have HIV than anywhere else in the world, HIV/AIDS and psychological disorder co-morbidity have been shown both to exacerbate the late diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and to affect adherence to ARVs. Targeted, affordable and evidence-based strategies to reach these populations are essential. Against this backdrop, a pilot project and situational assessment aimed at determining the context of psychological care and HIV treatment services in South Africa was undertaken. The situational analysis consisted of individual interviews, a patient survey, and a retrospective medical record data review. Training and mentorship were conducted from 2011 to 2013 by the Foundation for Professional Development (FPD) in five anti-retroviral therapy (ART) clinics in the Tshwane-Metsweding area. Data were both descriptively and inferentially analysed. Outcomes indicate that the general structure of HIV services is well organised and well run in the sampled clinics. However, mental healthcare and HIV services need to be integrated further. There is also a need to develop and pilot-test appropriate materials and models for the delivery of mental healthcare within the parameters of affordability, acceptability and availability further, and to advocate the advancement of mental health and HIV treatment and policy integration."
3456,0.003,3.0,"The natural history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients has never been studied according to the concept of liver fibrosis progression. The aim of this work was to assess the fibrosis progression rate in HIV-HCV coinfected patients and in patients infected by HCV only. A cohort of 122 HIV-HCV coinfected patients was compared with a control group of 122 HIV-negative HCV-infected patients. Groups were matched according to age, sex, daily alcohol consumption, age at HCV infection, and duration and route of HCV infection. The fibrosis progression rate was defined as the ratio between fibrosis stage (METAVIR scoring system) and the HCV duration. The prevalence of extensive liver fibrosis (METAVIR fibrosis scores 2, 3, and 4) and moderate or severe activity were higher in HIV-infected patients (60% and 54%, respectively) than in control patients (47% and 30%, respectively; P <.05 and P <.001, respectively). The median fibrosis progression rate in coinfected patients and in control patients was 0.153 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.117-0.181) and 0.106 (95% CI, 0.084-0.125) fibrosis units per year, respectively (P <.0001). HIV seropositivity (P <.0001), alcohol consumption (>50 g/d, P =.0002), age at HCV infection (<25 years old, P <.0001), and severe immunosuppression (CD4 count </=200 cells/microL, P <.0001) were associated with an increase in the fibrosis progression rate. In coinfected patients, alcohol consumption (>50 g/d), CD4 count (</=200 cells/microL), and age at HCV infection (<25 years old) (P <. 0001, respectively) were associated with a higher fibrosis progression rate. HIV seropositivity accelerates HCV-related liver fibrosis progression. In coinfected patients, a low CD4 count, alcohol consumption rate, and age at HCV infection are associated with a higher liver fibrosis progression rate."

In recent studies using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, investigators found a significant reduction in N-acetyl aspartate, a metabolic marker of neurons, in late stages of dementia. To further understand the relationship between proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy changes and clinical disease and dementia, we compared 20 HIV-infected patients presenting at varying stages of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex and infection to 10 age-matched controls. We found a significant reduction in N-acetyl aspartate/creatine only in patients who had advanced dementia and CD4 counts less that 200/microliter. By contrast, a significant elevation in compounds containing choline was present in patients in the early stages of HIV infection of who had CD4 counts greater than 200/microliter, in patients with normal MRI scans, and in all AIDS dementia complex groups, including subjects with no or minimal cognitive impairment. An elevated choline level also occurred in later stages of HIV infection (CD4 < 200/microliter). Our results suggest that an increase in choline occurs before N-acetyl aspartate decrements, MRI abnormalities, and the onset of dementia, and may therefore provide a useful marker for early detection of brain injury associated with HIV infection."
4070,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease in patients on hemodialysis. As no useful noninvasive predictors of disease activity and fibrosis have been found, liver biopsy is essential in these patients to accurately assess the severity of disease and thus the prognosis and plan management. The present study was undertaken to assess the degree of severity of necroinflammatory changes and fibrosis in liver biopsies of patients on hemodialysis with chronic HCV infection. Liver biopsies obtained from 45 patients on hemodialysis with serological evidence of chronic hepatitis C were studied. The grading of necroinflammatory activity and staging of fibrosis were histologically assessed. The majority of patients (30, i.e. 66.7%) had mild disease with mild inflammatory activity and stage 0, 1 or 2 fibrosis. There was no significant correlation between the degree of fibrosis and the age of the patients (rs = 0.015), the duration of hemodialysis (rs = 0.047) or the presence of steatosis (rs = 0.064). There was a positive correlation between the presence of bile ductular proliferation and the severity of fibrosis (rs = 0.612). It was concluded that chronic HCV infection in hemodialysis patients is relatively mild early in its course. However, serial follow-up liver biopsies are mandatory to plan appropriate intervention strategies."
177,0.003,3.0,"The risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission following a bite injury is important to many groups of people. The first are those who are likely to be bitten as an occupational risk, such as police officers and institutional staff. Another group are represented by the victims and perpetrators of crimes involving biting, both in attack and defense situations. The possibility of these bites transmitting a potentially fatal disease is of interest to the physicians who treat such patients and the legal system which may have to deal with the repercussions of such a transmission. Bite injuries represent 1% of all emergency department admissions in the United States, and human bites are the third most common following those of dogs and cats. The worldwide epidemic of HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) continues, with >5 million new cases last year and affecting 1 in 100 sexually active adults. A review of the literature concerning human bites, HIV and AIDS, HIV in saliva, and case examples was performed to examine the current opinion regarding the transmission of HIV via this route. A bite from an HIV-seropositive individual that breaks the skin or is associated with a previous injury carries a risk of infection for the bitten individual."

The most relevant laboratory parameter is the CD4 cell count. Therapy should be started before the CD4 cells drop below 200/microliter and the immune system becomes compromised. In contrast to past recommendations, viral load should not be used as a single laboratory parameter for initiation of antiretroviral therapy in asymptomatic untreated patients. The determination of genetic factors to assess the prognosis of HIV patients has not yet been incorporated into daily clinical practice.

HCV genotype 1 is the predominant genotype in HCV/HIV-coinfected individuals living in the United States. State-of-the-art treatment with peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin results in lower sustained HCV virologic response rates in patients with genotype 1 infection than in those infected with other genotypes. Data from studies of HCV infection treatment in coinfected patients are discussed, as are prospects for future therapy. This article summarizes a presentation on HIV/HCV coinfection by Robert T.

8221,0.003,3.0,"The RNA genome of the lentivirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is significantly richer in adenine nucleotides than the statistically equal distribution of the four different nucleotides that is expected. This compositional bias may be due to the guanine-to-adenine (G-->A) nucleotide hypermutation of the HIV genome, which has been explained by dCTP pool imbalances during reverse transcription. The adenine nucleotide bias together with the poor fidelity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase markedly enhances the genetic variation of HIV and may be responsible for the rapid emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains. We have now attempted to counteract the normal mutational pattern of HIV-1 in response to anti-HIV-1 drugs by altering the endogenous deoxynucleoside triphosphate pool ratios with antimetabolites in virus-infected cell cultures. We showed that administration of these antimetabolic compounds resulted in an altered drug resistance pattern due to the reversal of the predominant mutational flow of HIV (G-->A) to an adenine-to-guanine (A-->G) nucleotide pattern in the intact HIV-1-infected lymphocyte cultures. Forcing the virus to change its inherent nucleotide bias may lead to better control of viral drug resistance development."

The consequences are often devastating, resulting in enhanced morbidity and mortality. Due to the large number of confounding factors influencing pathogenesis in coinfected people, we sought to develop a nonhuman primate model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-malaria coinfection. In sub-Saharan Africa, Plasmodium falciparum is the most common malaria parasite and is responsible for most malaria-induced deaths. The simian malaria parasite Plasmodium fragile can induce clinical symptoms, including cerebral malaria in rhesus macaques, that resemble those of P. falciparum infection in humans. Thus, based on the well-characterized rhesus macaque model of SIV infection, this study reports the development of a novel rhesus macaque SIV-P. fragile coinfection model to study human HIV-P. falciparum coinfection. Using this model, we show that coinfection is associated with an increased, although transient, risk of both HIV and malaria transmission. Specifically, SIV-P. fragile coinfected macaques experienced an increase in SIV viremia that was temporarily associated with an increase in potential SIV target cells and systemic immune activation during acute parasitemia. Conversely, primary parasitemia in SIV-P. fragile coinfected animals resulted in higher gametocytemia that subsequently translated into higher oocyst development in mosquitoes. To our knowledge, this is the first animal model able to recapitulate the increased transmission risk of both HIV and malaria in coinfected humans. Therefore, this model could serve as an essential tool to elucidate distinct immunological, virological, and/or parasitological parameters underlying disease exacerbation in HIV-malaria coinfected people."
1158,0.003,3.0,"For 89 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and 32 HIV-negative immunocompromised patients who had 121 episodes of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), clinical features and changes over time were compared. HIV-infected patients characteristically had a longer duration of symptoms (23 vs. 13 days; P<.005); were younger (39 vs. 48 years; P<.001); had a higher frequency of sweating, weight loss, and thoracic pain; and had fewer admissions to the intensive care unit (16% vs. 31%; P<.05). In addition, they had significantly higher hemoglobin levels, lower thrombocyte counts, lower C-reactive protein values, and a higher proportion of eosinophils and lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. After 1995, HIV-negative patients' mean length of stay dropped from 34 days to 16 days (P<.005), and their hospital mortality rate dropped from 29% to 7% (P<.001). HIV-positive patients with PCP differed in several aspects from those without HIV infection. Knowledge gained from experience with treatment of opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS has improved the management of PCP in patients with other immunodeficiencies."
1971,0.003,3.0,"Adenoviruses have been described as a cause of diarrhoea in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The prevalence of adenoviruses was studied in all HIV-positive patients presenting with diarrhoea at the Royal Free Hospital in London between 1991 and 1995. In addition, all postmortems carried out in HIV-positive individuals registered at the same centre between 1990 and 1997 were reviewed for evidence of adenovirus infection. Adenovirus was detected in 16.1% of patients presenting with diarrhoea. These individuals had a significantly lower CD4 count and were more likely to have had a diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) than patients with diarrhoea in whom adenovirus was not detected. The median survival was 1 year compared with 2.4 years for those without adenoviruses; this difference remained significant (P = .008) after controlling for differences in CD4 counts between the groups. Gastrointestinal adenovirus excretion occurs at an advanced stage of HIV disease, and is associated with a poor prognosis. We suggest that adenoviruses may contribute to mortality in this population."
6469,0.003,3.0,"Information on bloody diarrhoea in HIV-positives is scarce. A prospective study was therefore performed, in Zimbabwe, to determine and compare the pathogens associated with bloody diarrhoea in 25 antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients and 15 non-HIV-infected patients. Stool cultures and colonic biopsies were performed. Shigella was isolated from 18 (45%) of the subjects, Schistosoma mansoni from eight (16%), Escherichia coli H7:O157 from three (8%) and Campylobacter jejunii from two (5%). There was no evidence of Salmonella, Entamoeba histolytica or cytomegalovirus infection. Shigella dysenteriae type-1 occurred more often in the HIV-negatives than the HIV-positives (P = 0.02). Although HIV-associated bloody diarrhoea in Zimbabwe appears to be most frequently caused by Shigella, it may also be commonly the result of infection with Sc. mansoni or shiga-toxin-producing E. coli. A larger study specifically to examine the role of Sc. mansoni and E. coli O157 is warranted."
6202,0.003,3.0,"Infection with the microsporidian parasite Enterocytozoon bieneusi may be a major cause of prolonged diarrhoea in individuals also infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The parasite has been reported from Europe, Australia and the Americas, with a prevalence of 7-29%. Faecal specimens were obtained from 202 adults and 106 children in Harare, Zimbabwe, all of whom were in hospital and had diarrhoea. HIV serology was available for 119 adults: 106 were HIV seropositive. There were clinical grounds for suspecting HIV infection in 23 of the remaining patients. E. bieneusi was identified in specimens from 13/129 patients (10%) for whom HIV infection was indicated by serology and/or clinical signs, 1/60 patients (2%) of uncertain HIV status, and 0/13 seronegative patients. 18/106 children were HIV seropositive and 12 were not; HIV serology was not available for the remainder, but 19 were strongly suspected of being infected with HIV on clinical criteria. E. bieneusi was not detected in samples from any child. As is common in Zimbabwe, the prevalence of other parasites in faecal specimens was low and, amongst patients with proven or suspected HIV infection, E. bieneusi was the most prevalent parasite identified, particularly in patients with diarrhoea of over 4 weeks duration."

In India, studies during the 1990s showed highly variable anti-HDV prevalence rates among HBV-infected persons; however, data using molecular testing and recent data are not available. We therefore studied the prevalence of HDV infection in HBV-infected patients using tests for anti-HDV and HDV ribonucleic acid (RNA)."
8209,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is dependent on the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) for transmission and replication because of its inability to produce its own coat. It remains unclear whether HDV infection increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Using the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and Outpatient Registry, we identified 9160 patients with chronic HBV infection between 1997 and 2008, of whom 327 had chronic HDV infection and 323 had acute HDV infection. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for these patients compared with the general population. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma was greatly increased in patients with HBV and HDV (SIR = 137.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 62.19 to 261.51). The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma among patients with HBV and HDV was increased (SIR = 6.11, 95% CI = 2.77 to 11.65) when patients with chronic HBV infection alone were used as the reference population. Similar results were observed for patients with chronic HDV infection (SIR = 99.26, 95% CI = 42.39 to 196.55). Our findings indicate that HDV is a strong risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma."

Because sexual contact often includes exposure to cellular material, we hypothesized that repeated mucosal exposure to heterologous cells would induce an immune response that would alter the susceptibility to mucosal infection. Using the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) model of HIV-1 mucosal transmission, the cervicovaginal mucosa was exposed once weekly for 12 weeks to 5,000 heterologous cells or media (control) and then cats were vaginally challenged with cell-associated or cell-free FIV."
6272,0.003,3.0,"Sexual transmission represents the principal mode of transmission for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) worldwide. We examined the HIV-1 seroprevalence and risk factors for infection among 613 female commercial sex workers (FCSW) in Isla Margarita, Venezuela. Recruitment was conducted in street venues and working locations. None of the FCSW tested positive for HIV; this correlated with the low self-reported rates of sexually transmitted infections (6%), drug use (<20%), and alcohol abuse (12%). Condom use and safe-sex practices were found to be practiced regularly (>80% of time) with clients; however, such practices were found to be very uncommon in nonclient relations (<20% of the time). Understanding the sexual risk behaviors, beliefs, and drug use patterns of FCSW is important for future development of effective public prevention policies and educational campaigns aimed at decreasing the risk of infection with HIV-1 and other sexually transmitted infections among FCSW."
2495,0.003,3.0,"To estimate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) among parturients in an area with a high cumulative incidence of AIDS, an HIV seroprevalence study was conducted in 1988 in Los Angeles County. Test results were available from 8485 (86.1%) of the 9860 women delivering at four public hospitals. The test results were linked to demographic and medical information available from routinely collected delivery records. Three specimens were HIV-positive, for a seroprevalence of 3.5 per 10,000. The seropositive women were all Latina. The prevalence of HIV among women delivering at all hospitals in Los Angeles County has been shown to be relatively low compared with that of other metropolitan areas with a high number of AIDS cases, such as New York city, but appears to be even lower among women delivering at public hospitals during this time period. This low prevalence is attributed to the predominance of Latinas, who may have lower levels of infection, among public hospital parturients. The relatively low prevalence of HIV among injection drug users in Los Angeles County may contribute to the overall lower prevalence among women in Los Angeles County compared with those in New York city. This study supplements county-specific data obtained from statewide blinded neonatal testing by providing details on HIV seroprevalence among the catchment populations of public hospitals in Los Angeles County."
9173,0.003,3.0,"The extent to which HIV-1 proviral DNA mutations cause clinically relevant antiretroviral resistance is still controversial. Paired plasma HIV-1 RNA and whole blood DNA were compared in patients failing HAART to investigate if the additional knowledge of archived mutations could improve the selection of potentially active drugs. Seventy-three HIV-1-infected patients with first/second HAART failure were studied before starting a new regimen based on RNA genotyping. Follow-up data after a 12-week therapy were available. DNA genotyping was retrospectively performed on stored whole blood samples and mutational profiles were compared to those from RNA. The mean number of IAS pol mutations was significantly higher in RNA (4.45 +/- 2.76) than in DNA (2.88 +/- 2.47) (P < 0.001). DNA genotyping provided a 6% increase in detection of resistance-associated mutations. Among 64/73 patients showing discordant DNA/RNA profiles, 54 (84%) also differed for predicted active drugs. 16/73 (22%) patients had >or=1 mutation revealed by DNA genotyping alone, probably affecting therapy success in 2/16. However, neither RNA/DNA discordance nor detection of isolated DNA mutations were statistically associated with outcome. In conclusion, plasma RNA remains the elective choice for HIV genotyping in patients with therapy failure, even if the detection of proviral resistance-associated mutations, not simultaneously found in RNA, is a frequent event. Therefore, in some cases DNA plus RNA genotyping might assist in choosing more accurately subsequent antiretroviral regimens."
3093,0.003,3.0,"Individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have an increased incidence of high-grade B-cell lymphoma. In many instances, these lymphomas contain Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) genomes. To investigate the role of EBV in development of HIV-related lymphoma, benign fixed lymph node biopsies from normal individuals and HIV-infected individuals with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) were analyzed for EBV sequences by polymerase chain reaction and in situ DNA hybridization techniques. EBV DNA was not detected in any of 16 benign lymph node biopsies from normal individuals, but could be detected from 13 of 35 PGL biopsies. The EBV-infected cells were present in both follicular and interfollicular areas and in both small and large lymphoid cells. The presence of detectable amounts of EBV DNA in the 13 PGL biopsies was associated with an increased incidence of concurrent lymphoma at another site (n = 3) or development of lymphoma in time (n = 2). In contrast, only 1 of 22 individuals with EBV-negative PGL biopsies developed lymphoma in time (P less than .05). EBV was detected in all five lymphomas in which tissue was available for subsequent analysis, including the lymphoma that developed in the individual without EBV in his previous PGL biopsy. These findings support the hypothesis that EBV plays a role in development of some HIV-related lymphomas. Detectable EBV lymphoproliferations occur in a few PGL biopsies and are associated with a significant risk of EBV DNA-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."
2159,0.003,3.0,"Our previous study demonstrated the anti-apoptosis function of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vpu gene product in normal CD4+ T lymphocytes. In this study, using sequences obtained from the HIV sequence database, we compared vpu sequences from 184 preparations of various subtypes of HIV-1 from diverse geographical regions. Our analysis revealed that CRF01_AE isolates had premature stop codon mutations at the vpu gene at a much higher rate (36%) than other subtypes (0-9%). The premature stop codon mutations in vpu existed mostly at two amino acid residues: the methionine initiation codon and the boundary between the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains. The mutations at the latter site were more often detected in CRF01_AE. The higher mutation rates at vpu in CRF01_AE were confirmed by sequence comparison of polymerase chain reaction products newly obtained directly from the DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but not from the RNA from the plasma, in CRF01_AE- and subtype B-infected individuals. This finding may indicate the possibility that the more abundant population of HIV-1 CRF01_AE is able to induce apoptosis in CD4+ T lymphocytes than the populations of other subtypes."

Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and RANTES (but not MCP-3), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, or interleukin-8 (IL-8) was higher in HAD. MCP-1 correlated with CSF viral load and severity of dementia, and it increased over time in patients who developed dementia."
2016,0.003,3.0,"""Phylodynamic"" analysis combines various statistical procedures that can be used to correlate the epidemiological and evolutionary behavior of viral pathogens with the immune system of the host. We utilized this approach to examine human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 envelope DNA sequences (V1, V2, and V3) isolated from different brain compartments of a T-cell-depleted patient diagnosed with severe HIV-associated dementia at the time of death. In agreement with previous reports, phylogenetic analysis showed distinct virodemes but also revealed a significant amount of viral gene flow among different brain compartments. Local-molecular-clock analysis showed that HIV-1 meninges and temporal lobe subpopulations evolve about 30 and 100 times faster, respectively, than the other viral populations in the brain. However, maximum likelihood codon-based substitution models did not detect any site under significant positive selective pressure, and the main cause of HIV-1 genetic variation appeared to be random genetic drift. Therefore, the higher evolutionary rate in the meninges and temporal lobe could be due to an enhanced infection/expansion rate of macrophages as a consequence of the immune system failure. In conclusion, in this case study, viral infection in the brain progressed with a nonspecific genetic evolution, recurrent migration events, and an expansion of macrophage-tropic sequences. The data suggest that after immune failure newly produced viral variants, which would be rapidly cleared under normal conditions, begin to productively infect macrophages in a ""self-amplifying"" cycle of infection/inflammatory response that could be at the origin of HIV-associated dementia."
9358,0.003,3.0,"Human pluripotential embryonic teratocarcinoma cells differentially expressed gene activity controlled by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) long terminal repeats (LTRs) when differentiation was induced by the morphogen all-trans retinoic acid. The alterations occurred after commitment and before the appearance of the multiple cell types characteristic of these pluripotential cells. After commitment, gene activity controlled by the HIV-1 LTR markedly increased, whereas that controlled by the HTLV-I LTR decreased. Steady-state mRNA levels and nuclear run-on transcription indicated that the increased HIV-1-directed activity during differentiation occurred posttranscriptionally, whereas the decreased HTLV-I activity was at the transcriptional level. Phorbol esters did not cause commitment but strongly enhanced expression by both viral LTRs at the transcriptional level. A specific inhibitor of protein kinase C, 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, indicated that the enhanced activity involved the activation of protein kinase(s) C; altered cyclic nucleotide metabolism was apparently not involved. Differentiating cells gradually lost the ability to respond to phorbol ester stimulation. Experiments with a deletion mutant of the HIV-1 LTR suggested that this was due to imposition of negative regulation during differentiation that was not reversed by phorbol ester induction. Cycloheximide, with or without phorbol ester, slightly stimulated HIV-1-directed activity at the transcriptional level and massively increased the amounts of steady-state mRNA by posttranscriptional superinduction. It appeared, however, that new nuclear protein synthesis was required for maximal transcriptional stimulation by phorbol esters. Thus, changing cellular regulatory mechanisms influenced human retrovirus expression during human embryonic cell differentiation."

4562,0.003,3.0,"Introduction There are several classifications for abdominal hernias, and a non-traumatic lateral wall hernia (LAWH) is a rare type. We report the first case of a patient with LAWH infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Case History A 53-year-old HIV-infected male presented with an abdominal mass. The patient had a history of treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy. A LAWH was diagnosed based on physical examination and findings of computed tomography. Open mesh repair was undertaken successfully. The patient had no evidence of a recurrent hernia during 11 months of follow-up. Conclusions High intra-abdominal pressure and weak connective tissue can lead to LAWHs. Antiretroviral therapy and lipodystrophy can cause LAWHs in HIV-infected patients. "
2964,0.003,3.0,"An important driving force behind the sequence diversity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is viral adaptation to host immune responses. To gain an insight into the impact of host immunity on genetic diversification and properties of HBV, we characterized HBV of genotype D from treatment-naive hepatitis B e antigen-positive (EP) and hepatitis B e antigen-negative (EN) patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), where HBV is under stronger immune pressure, with that of HBV derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV-coinfected individuals, where HIV infection has significantly weakened the immune system. Full-length sequence analysis showed that HBV heterogeneity was most extensive in EN-CHB followed by EP-CHB and HIV/HBV coinfection. The relative magnitude of non-synonymous changes within B-cell epitopes was greater than that in T-cell epitopes of HBV open reading frames (ORFs) in both EP-CHB and EN-CHB. Nine amino acid substitutions were identified in B-cell epitopes and one in a T-cell epitope of HBV in EN-CHB, most of which resulted in altered hydrophobicities, as determined using the Kyte and Doolittle method, relative to wild-type residues found in HBV from the HIV-positive group. Additionally, 19 substitutions occurred at significantly higher frequencies in non-epitope regions of HBV ORF-P in EN-CHB than HIV/HBV-coinfected patients. In vitro replication assay demonstrated that the substitutions, particularly in reverse transcriptase and RNaseH domains of ORF-P, resulted in a decline in replication capacity of HBV. Hence, our results indicate that HBV adapts to increasing immune pressure through preferential mutations in B-cell epitopes and by replicative attenuation. The viral epitopes linked to immune response identified in this study bear important implications for future HBV vaccine studies."
2315,0.003,3.0,"Individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are generally divided into asymptomatic healthy carriers and patients with chronic liver disease. Several studies have suggested that the hepatitis B core antigen could be an immunological target of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). To investigate the possible pressure site from CTL, the entire core region of HBV DNA was sequenced in 30 subjects (10 asymptomatic healthy carriers and 20 patients with chronic liver disease). No significant changes in the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid residue were noted in the 10 healthy carriers. In contrast, a cluster of changes in a small segment of 18 amino acids (codons 84-101 from the start of the core gene) was found in 15 of the 20 chronic liver disease patients. All these 15 patients had advanced liver diseases (chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis), whereas only mild liver disease (chronic persistent hepatitis) was found in the five patients without mutations. These data suggest that the region with mutation clustering is the major target of CTL, and that the mutations evolve under the pressure of immune selection."
8580,0.003,3.0,"Enfuvirtide (ENF) administration by needle/syringe is commonly associated with injection site reactions (ISRs). This study assessed ISRs and participant preference between a needle-free injection device (NFID) and a 27-gauge 1/2-inch needle/syringe (NS). A total of 349 participants with human immunodeficiency virus infection, who had difficulty tolerating long-term administration of ENF by NS, underwent randomization (2:1) to ENF administered twice daily by NFID for 8 weeks, or by NS for 4 weeks followed by NFID for 4 weeks. The objectives of the study were to compare ISRs associated with ENF injection using NFID or NS based on a composite endpoint, ISR incidence/severity, overall ISR scores, and discontinuations. In the NFID group, ISRs improved as the percentage of participants meeting the composite endpoint decreased from baseline (40.1%) to week 4 (25.4%) and remained stable at week 8 (21.2%). In the NS --> NFID group, the percentage meeting the composite endpoint worsened from baseline (36.5%) to week 4 (45.1%), but improved at week 8 (26.1%) after switching. Between-participant comparison showed a statistically significant greater improvement from baseline to week 4 in overall ISR score in the NFID group compared to the NS group. Within-participant comparison of the NS --> NFID group showed a significantly greater decrease in overall ISR score from baseline to week 8. In responses to a questionnaire, 87.2% of the participants surveyed preferred the NFID delivery system over NS. NFID is an alternative injection method that may reduce the incidence and severity of treatment-limiting ISRs associated with ENF administration."
1806,0.003,3.0,"The Patient Knowledge Assessment Study (PKAS) was conducted among 107 male hemophilic patients, aged 15 to 67 years, at 19 hemophilia treatment centers (HTC). Participants were given a 30-item questionnaire concerning the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the groups at risk, and modes of transmission. The questionnaire included questions on the participant's status in regard to antibody to human T-lymphotropic retrovirus, type III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus (HTLV-III/LAV), and the meaning of this test result. HTC health-care providers were asked to complete a separate questionnaire containing 17 questions about information given patients concerning their HTLV-III/LAV antibody status and its meaning. Overall, patients had a good base of knowledge about AIDS; however, there were gaps in this knowledge. Twenty-nine percent of patients did not know that spouses of AIDS patients were at risk for AIDS; 47% did not know that sexual partners of persons with hemophilia were at risk; and 32% did not know that hemophilic children were at risk. Further, only 69% understood that antibody-positive individuals had had contact with the AIDS virus. Identifying these and other areas of misunderstanding will provide the information needed to design educational strategies and psychosocial support programs appropriate for the hemophilic population, and which may serve as a model for other populations."
7523,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected males have poor treatment outcomes after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared to HIV-infected women. Dietary factors might mediate the association between sex and disease progression. However, the gender difference in diet among HIV-infected individuals in sub-Saharan Africa is largely unknown. The objective of this study was to examine differences in dietary intake among HIV-infected men and women. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of dietary questionnaire data from 2038 adults initiating ART in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to assess whether nutrient adequacy differed by sex. We dichotomized participants' nutrient intakes by whether recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) were met and estimated the relative risk (RR) of meeting RDAs in males using binomial regression models. We also estimated the mean difference in intake of foods and food groups by gender. We found poorer dietary practices among men compared to women. Males were less likely to meet the RDAs for micronutrients critical for slowing disease progression among HIV patients: niacin (RR = 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27 to 0.55), riboflavin (RR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.91), vitamin C (RR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.00), and zinc (RR = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.24). Intake of thiamine, pantothenate, vitamins B6, B12, and E did not vary by gender. Males were less likely to eat cereals (mean difference [servings per day] = -0.21, 95% CI: -0.44 to 0.001) and vegetables (mean difference = -0.47, 95% CI: -0.86 to -0.07) in their diet, but more likely to have meat (mean difference = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.21). We conclude that male HIV patients have poorer dietary practices than females, and this may contribute to faster progression of the disease in males. "
9531,0.003,3.0,"We assessed the impact of an efavirenz-containing regimen versus a protease inhibitor-containing regimen on quality of life, emotional status, and adherence of HIV-1-infected patients. In addition, we sought to define the adverse events associated with these treatments, with a special focus on central nervous system disorders in the efavirenz treatment group. This prospective, randomized, two-arm, controlled study included 100 patients for whom initial treatment with a protease inhibitor-containing regimen failed. Patients were randomized to start treatment with two nucleoside retrotranscriptase inhibitors plus efavirenz (group 1; 51 patients) or two nucleoside retrotranscriptase inhibitors plus one or more new protease inhibitors (group 2; 49 patients). Quality of life was assessed by a five-point item adapted from the HIV questionnaire of the Medical Outcomes Study, emotional status was evaluated by the Profile of Mood State questionnaire, and patients self-reported adherence. Data were analyzed by both an as-treated method and an intention-to-treat-last observation carried forward method. Patients in group 1 reported the following findings at week 4: dizziness (66%), abnormal dreaming (48%), light-headedness (37%), and difficulty sleeping (35%). At week 24, dizziness (13%; p <.001), abnormal dreaming (18%; p =.002), light-headedness (13%; p =.01), difficulty sleeping (7%; p =.001), and nervousness (13%; p =.01) decreased in these patients. Irritability, abnormal dreaming, and nervousness persisted at week 48 in 13%, 10%, and 8% of group 1 patients, respectively. Patients in group 2 reported the following findings at week 4: light-headedness (8%), dizziness (5%), difficulty sleeping (4%), nervousness (4%), and headaches (3%). Patients in group 2 reported the following findings at week 48: difficulty sleeping (4%), nervousness (3%), headaches (3%), and light-headedness (2%). In group 1, quality of life (p <.001) and emotional status (week 48; p =.004) improved, both of which were better than those in group 2 (p =.001). Both groups maintained high levels of medication adherence, and no significant differences in the number of patients who had viral loads of <200 copies/mL at week 48 were found (78% of group 1 patients vs. 85% of group 2 patients; p = not significant). At week 48, the mean CD4 cell count +/- SD was 497 +/- 224/mm3 in group 1 and 539 +/- 298/mm3 in group 2 (p = not significant). Despite similar immunologic and virologic outcomes, a second-line efavirenz-containing regimen improved quality of life of HIV-1-infected patients compared with a second-line protease inhibitor-containing regimen. However, close follow-up of patients receiving treatment with efavirenz-based regimens is recommended, especially for those with previous emotional disturbances due to central nervous system disorders in the short term and those with persistence of a low percentage of these disorders in the long term."
2132,0.003,3.0,"Loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is considered to reflect the resolution of a hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Patient characteristics and various seromarkers were evaluated to characterize factors predicting spontaneous HBsAg loss in a cohort of HBeAg-seronegative patients with presumed chronic HBV infection. Relationships between seromarkers and HBsAg loss were assessed annually and after 6 years using binary logistic regression. Among the 634 participants, 117 (18.45%) cleared HBsAg after 6 years, with a 3.08% annual seroclearance rate. Baseline HBsAg levels and platelet (PLT) counts were predictors of HBsAg seroclearance. The HBsAg level predicted HBsAg seroclearance better than the PLT count (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): HBsAg, 0.965 (95%CI, 0.947-0.980) versus PLT count, 0.617 (95%CI, 0.561-0.669); P < 0.001). A cutoff HBsAg level of 10 IU/ml at baseline predicted spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance at 6 years with a diagnostic accuracy of 93.4%, a sensitivity of 87.2%, a specificity of 94.8%, a positive predictive value of 79.1%, and a negative predictive value of 97.0%. HBsAg seroclearance may occur more commonly than expected. A serum HBsAg level <10 IU/ml and PLT count were accurate predictors of clearance."
3986,0.003,3.0,"An integrated HIV-1 genomic DNA leads to an infected cell becoming either an active or a latent virus-producing cell. Upon appropriate activation, a latently infected cell can result in production of progeny viruses that spread the infection to uninfected cells. The host proteins influence several steps of HIV-1 infection including formation of the preintegration complex (PIC), a key nucleoprotein intermediate essential for integration of reverse transcribed viral DNA into the chromosome. Much effort has gone into the identification of host proteins contributing to the assembly of functional PICs. Experimental approaches included the use of yeast two-hybrid system, co-immunoprecipitation, affinity tagged HIV-1 viral proteins and in vitro reconstitution of salt-stripped PIC activity. Several host proteins identified using these approaches have been shown to affect HIV-1 replication in cells and influence catalytic activities of recombinant IN in vitro. However, the comprehensive identification and characterization of host proteins associated with HIV-1 PICs of infected cells have been hindered in part by the technical limitation in acquiring sufficient amount of catalytically active PICs. To efficiently identify additional host factors associated with PICs in infected cells, we have developed the following novel approach. The catalytically active PICs from HIV-1-infected CD4+ cells were isolated using biotinylated target DNA, and the proteins selectively co-purifying with PICs have been analyzed by mass spectrometry. This technology enabled us to reveal at least 19 host proteins that are associated with HIV-1 PICs, of which 18 proteins have not been described previously with respect to HIV-1 integration. Physiological functions of the identified proteins range from chromatin organization to protein transport. A detailed characterization of these host proteins could provide new insights into the mechanism of HIV-1 integration and uncover new antiviral targets to block HIV-1 integration."
9649,0.003,3.0,"Functional retroviral integrase protein is thought to be essential for productive viral replication. Yet, previous studies differed on the extent to which integrase mutant viruses expressed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genes from unintegrated DNA. Although one reason for this difference was that class II integrase mutations pleiotropically affected the viral life cycle, another reason apparently depended on the identity of the infected cell. Here, we analyzed integrase mutant viral infectivities in a variety of cell types. Single-round infectivity of class I integration-specific mutant HIV-1 ranged from <0.03 to 0.3% of that of the wild type (WT) across four different T-cell lines. Based on this approximately 10-fold influence of cell type on mutant gene expression, we examined class I and class II mutant replication kinetics in seven different cell lines and two primary cell types. Unexpectedly, some cell lines supported productive class I mutant viral replication under conditions that restricted class II mutant growth. Cells were defined as permissive, semipermissive, or nonpermissive based on their ability to support the continual passage of class I integration-defective HIV-1. Mutant infectivity in semipermissive and permissive cells as quantified by 50% tissue culture infectious doses, however, was only 0.0006 to 0.005% of that of WT. Since the frequencies of mutant DNA recombination in these lines ranged from 0.023 to <0.093% of the WT, we conclude that productive replication in the absence of integrase function most likely required the illegitimate integration of HIV-1 into host chromosomes by cellular DNA recombination enzymes."
5642,0.003,3.0,"Immune activation is a major characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and a strong prognostic factor for HIV-1 disease progression. The underlying mechanisms leading to immune activation in viremic HIV-1 infection, however, are not fully understood. Here we show that, following the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the immediate decline of immune activation is closely associated with the reduction of HIV-1 viremia, which suggests a direct contribution of HIV-1 itself to immune activation. To propose a mechanism, we demonstrate that the single-stranded RNA of HIV-1 encodes multiple uridine-rich Toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) ligands that induce strong MyD88-dependent plasmacytoid dendritic cell and monocyte activation, as well as accessory cell-dependent T-cell activation. HIV-1-encoded TLR ligands may, therefore, directly contribute to the immune activation observed during viremic HIV-1 infection. These data provide an initial rationale for inhibiting the TLR pathway to directly reduce the chronic immune activation induced by HIV-1 and the associated immune pathogenesis."
406,0.003,3.0,"Increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) associated with HIV-1 infection is primarily attributed to deficient T helper (Th)1 immune responses, but most people with active TB have robust Th1 responses, indicating that these are not sufficient to protect against disease. Recent findings suggest that favourable outcomes following Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection arise from finely balanced inflammatory and regulatory pathways, achieving pathogen control without immunopathology. We hypothesised that HIV-1 and antiretroviral therapy (ART) exert widespread changes to cell mediated immunity, which may compromise the optimal host protective response to TB and provide novel insights into the correlates of immune protection and pathogenesis. We sought to define these effects in patients with active TB by transcriptional profiling of tuberculin skin tests (TST) to make comprehensive molecular level assessments of in vivo human immune responses at the site of a standardised mycobacterial challenge. We showed that the TST transcriptome accurately reflects the molecular pathology at the site of human pulmonary TB, and used this approach to investigate immune dysregulation in HIV-1/TB co-infected patients with distinct clinical phenotypes associated with TST reactivity or anergy and unmasking TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after initiation of ART. HIV-1 infected patients with positive TSTs exhibited preserved Th1 responses but deficient immunoregulatory IL10-inducible responses. Those with clinically negative TSTs revealed profound anergy of innate as well as adaptive immune responses, except for preservation of type 1 interferon activity, implicated in impaired anti-mycobacterial immunity. Patients with unmasking TB IRIS showed recovery of Th1 immunity to normal levels, but exaggerated Th2-associated responses specifically. These mechanisms of immune dysregulation were localised to the tissue microenvironment and not evident in peripheral blood. TST molecular profiling categorised different mechanisms of immunological dysfunction in HIV-1 infection beyond the effects on CD4 T cells, each associated with increased risk of TB disease and amenable to host-directed therapies.

9007,0.003,3.0,"We hypothesized that rapid presentation may be a general feature of tuberculosis (TB) associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that limits the impact of HIV on the point prevalence of TB. To investigate this, we performed a cross-sectional HIV and TB disease survey with retrospective and prospective follow-up. HIV prevalence among 1,773 systematically recruited miners was 27%. TB incidence was much more strongly HIV associated (incidence rate ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-8.6) than the point prevalence of undiagnosed TB disease (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9-3.3). For smear-positive TB, 7 of 9 (78%) prevalent cases were HIV negative, and point prevalence was nonsignificantly lower in miners who were HIV positive (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.1-4.2). The calculated mean duration of smear positivity before diagnosis (point prevalence/incidence) was substantially shorter for HIV-positive than HIV-negative TB patients (0.17 and 1.15 years, respectively; ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.00-0.73). HIV has considerably less impact on the point prevalence of TB disease than on TB incidence, probably because rapid disease progression increases presentation and case-finding rates. The difference in mean duration of smear positivity was particularly marked and, if generalizable, will have major implications for TB control prospects in high HIV prevalence areas."
5752,0.003,3.0,"No data on antiviral response of HBV genotypes E-H are available so far although these HBV genotypes contribute significantly to the global HBV burden. Of 49 patients with HBV genotypes E-H, 23 received interferon (IFN)-alpha, 12 nucleos(t)ide analogues and 14 patients were untreated. HBV genotype was determined by direct sequencing of the HBV S gene. Sustained virological response in IFN-treated patients was defined as normalization of ALT and decrease of HBV-DNA <4,000 IU/ml 6 months after treatment. Virological response with nucleos(t)ide analogues was assumed in patients with a HBV-DNA <200 IU/ml after 48 weeks of treatment. HBV genotype E was found in 61.2% (n = 30), HBV genotype F in 8.2% (n = 4), HBV genotype H in 10.2% (n = 5) of patients. Among patients with HBV genotype G (20.4%; n = 10) there were four HBV genotype G/A and three HBV genotype G/C co-infections. Patients had Caucasian (43%), African (55%), or Asian (2%) background. End of treatment response was 70% (16/23) and sustained virological response was 35% (8/23) for patients treated with IFN-alpha. Sustained virological response was 36% for HBV genotype E (n = 5/14), 50% for HBV genotype F or H (n = 2/4), and 20% for HBV genotype G (n = 1/5). Virus suppression at week 48 was achieved in 67% of patients treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues. According to the present preliminary data HBV genotypes E, F, and H appear to be sensitive to IFN-alpha. Lower rates of response to IFN-alpha in patients with HBV genotype G might be related to the frequent occurrence of double infection."
3031,0.003,3.0,"Anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) therapy leads to the emergence of mutant viral strains during the treatment of chronic hepatitis B with nucleos(t)ides analogues. The existence of HBV variants with primary antiviral resistance may be important for treatment choice. We studied two patients with chronic HBV infection by sequencing the HBV polymerase gene. They had adefovir- and tenofovir-related mutations in the viral polymerase, although they had never been treated. These mutations were rtV214A/rtN238T in one patient and rtA194T in the other. Thus, mutations in untreated patients deserve cautious surveillance. These data indicate that mutations that can theoretically confer adefovir or tenofovir resistance may emerge in treatment-naive patients."
1936,0.003,3.0,"The risk of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is increased in patients infected with HIV-1. We studied the incidence and outcomes of HL, and compared CD4⁺ T-cell trajectories in HL patients and controls matched for duration of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). A total of 40 168 adult HIV-1-infected patients (median age, 36 years; 70% male; median CD4 cell count, 234 cells/μL) from 16 European cohorts were observed during 159 133 person-years; 78 patients developed HL. The incidence was 49.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.3-61.2) per 100,000 person-years, and similar on cART and not on cART (P = .96). The risk of HL declined as the most recent (time-updated) CD4 count increased: the adjusted hazard ratio comparing more than 350 with less than 50 cells/μL was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.08-0.86). Sixty-one HL cases diagnosed on cART were matched to 1652 controls: during the year before diagnosis, cases lost 98 CD4 cells (95% CI, -159 to -36 cells), whereas controls gained 35 cells (95% CI, 24-46 cells; P < .0001). The incidence of HL is not reduced by cART, and patients whose CD4 cell counts decline despite suppression of HIV-1 replication on cART may harbor HL."
3871,0.003,3.0,"As part of a continuous search for surrogate markers of therapeutic efficacy in AIDS, spontaneous in vitro production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of antibody to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was investigated in 50 HIV-1-infected adults. It was independent of CD4+ cell counts, p24 antigenemia, serum beta 2-microglobulin concentration, and clinical status of the patients. The effect of zidovudine on this antibody secretion and the appearance of signs or symptoms of HIV-1 disease progression were evaluated in 20 patients over 24 weeks. Anti-HIV-1 antibody secretion decreased significantly (P = .002) as of the first month of zidovudine treatment only in the 13 HIV-1-infected patients without disease progression. This is earlier than the occurrence of variations in CD4+ cell count and serum beta 2-microglobulin concentration. These results suggest that in vitro antibody production could be a surrogate marker for evaluation of the in vivo antiretroviral efficacy of zidovudine, even in p24 antigen-negative patients."
1489,0.003,3.0,"The detection of infectious immune complexes in plasma after human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may be useful as a surrogate marker of progression of disease and may help in understanding the pathogenesis of AIDS. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitates of plasma were tested for the presence of HIV p24 antigen and infectious virus. Results were compared with data from cell and plasma cultures, plasma p24 antigen, CD4 cell counts, and stage of disease. PEG precipitation increased the detection rate of the p24 antigen assay from 38.3% to 58.7%. There was a significant correlation between precipitable p24 antigen and plasma viremia, changes in CD4 cell counts, and progression of disease. The sensitivity of the PEG-precipitable p24 antigen assay versus traditional p24 antigen testing was 59.0% and the specificity 91.7%. The assay was reproducible and may be a useful determinant of viral load, clinical progression, and antiretroviral efficacy."
7063,0.003,3.0,"The prevalence of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV-1) was determined in 924 outpatients attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic. The overall prevalence of anti-HIV-1 was 9%. Six of 14 intravenous drug addicts and 4 of 34 patients of African origin were anti-HIV-1 positive. In the other 876 patients, the anti-HIV prevalence was 6.6% in 467 heterosexual men, 5% in 261 heterosexual women and 22.3% in 148 homosexual or bisexual men. The prevalence of anti-HIV-1 in the heterosexual subjects was much higher than that expected in the general population and than that observed in patients attending sexually transmitted disease clinics in other developed countries. Intravenous drug abusers, who represent the most important group at risk for AIDS in Italy, could contribute to the spread of HIV infection through heterosexual contacts with persons without other known risk factors."
149,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has infected an estimated 170 million people worldwide, most of whom are chronically infected (60% to 80%). In Italy, the estimate of anti-HCV antibody (Ab) prevalence, in the general population of Northern Italy, is 3.2%; in Central and Southern Italy, it is 8.4% to 22.4%. Highest prevalence of infection (70% to 90%) is found among intravenous drug users. Our purpose is to monitor HCV infection among drug users treated in a Drug Addiction Centre (Ser.T) in Naples and to gain a better understanding of that relationship with the abused substance(s). Epidemiological data are shown for viral coinfections. Finally, the authors investigate access to specific HCV therapy in an Italian Ser.T. The study analyzed a group of 1753 consecutive subjects treated from 1988 to 2008 in the O.U. Ser.T D.S.31 (Gesù e Maria Hospital), ASL Napoli 1 Centre. HCV Abs were detected by enzyme immune assay method and confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay III method. During the entire period, we performed real-time polymerase chain reaction at random for 312 patients. The incidence (per year) of HCV infection showed a rapid spread decrease from 49.5% in 2003 to 14.5% in 2008. The overall prevalence of HCV was 48.1%. We tested 312 randomly selected patients for viral replication. Our study showed active viral replication in 201 (64.4%) patients as follows: 97 of 201 (31.1%) resulted infected by genotype (gt) 1; 3 of 201 (1.0%) gt 2; 84 of 201 (26.9%) gt 3; and 4 of 201 (1.3%) gt 4. Coinfection data showed that HCV Ab prevalence was 58.5% (48 of 82) in hepatitis B virus chronically infected patients. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV coinfection resulted in 95.2% (80 of 84) HIV patients. The prevalence of HIV Abs in HCV-infected patients was 8.99% (80 of 889). Analysis of drug abuse showed high prevalence of opiate addicted, multiabusers, and with high-risk factors. Cocaine abuser prevalence was 14.4%, and incidence, during past 4 years of the study, rose to 42.6%. Alcohol abuser prevalence represented 5.8% of patients and incidence rose to 17.7% in final 4 years of the study. In those opiate addicted, HCV infection was 61.0% (805 of 1320). HCV infection in cocaine-addicted patients was 9.5% (24 of 253). In 78 delta-9-tetra-hydro-cannabinol addicted patients, 5.1% of tests were positive (4 of 78). In alcohol abusers, HCV infection was 9.8% (10 of 102). Access to HCV treatment in our cohort from 2000 to 2008 resulted low (15.4%). Enhancing the Ser.Ts efficiency can result in health and financial benefits."

6567,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has been used for the detection of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Recently, HBV detection using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been shown to be a direct measure of complete virions and to be potentially a very sensitive method. Therefore, we attempted to analyze the relationship between HBsAg detection and HBV DNA assay by PCR. We tested HBV DNA by a modification of the PCR technique in serial sera from five chimpanzees experimentally infected with HBV and 29 human sera. Our new method of PCR analysis is as sensitive as former methods but is more simple and rapid than existing procedures. In chimpanzee studies, HBV DNA was detected 2-3 weeks before the appearance of HBsAg, and continued to be detectable 2 weeks after the production of antibody to HBsAg. Also, 3 of 11 chronic hepatitis B patients who lost HBsAg were positive for HBV DNA in serum, while all of patients who recovered from acute viral infection were negative for HBV DNA in serum. These results indicate that HBV DNA detection by PCR analysis is the most sensitive method currently available to detect the presence of complete virions in serum."
5944,0.003,3.0,We administered a questionnaire pertaining to recent gains in knowledge about HIV/AIDS treatment and natural history in mid-1990 to all physicians and nurses at a 455-bed public teaching hospital. Surveys were returned by 127 physicians (46%) and 541 nurses (77%). Responses indicated that only 37% of physicians and 18% of nurses knew that the risk for an AIDS-related opportunistic infection becomes significant when the T-helper cell count falls below 200 cells per cubic millimeter. One-fourth of physicians (23%) and more than one-half of nurses (55%) were not aware that the HIV enzyme immunoassay test alone is insufficient to properly determine a patient's HIV serostatus. The survey results revealed a broad deficit in knowledge about the natural history and treatment of HIV infection and demonstrated the need for a clinically relevant core HIV/AIDS knowledge curriculum and for strategies to better educate health care providers to improve care given to HIV-infected patients.

This substudy evaluated the emergence of nevirapine-resistance mutations at 6 weeks postpartum in a subgroup of participants. Maternal risk factors for the emergence of nevirapine-resistance mutations were evaluated. Mutations associated with nevirapine resistance were detectable at delivery, prior to receipt of study drug, in 5 (2.3%) of 217 women. Fourteen (15%; 95% confidence interval, 8%-23%) of 95 women who received intrapartum nevirapine developed a nevirapine-resistance mutation 6 weeks postpartum. The most common mutation was K103N, which was present in 10 women. The risk for development of a new nevirapine-resistance mutation did not correlate with CD4 cell count or HIV-1 RNA load at delivery or with type of antepartum antiretroviral therapy. The risk of nevirapine resistance should be considered when determining the risks or benefits of intrapartum nevirapine in women receiving antepartum antiretroviral therapy."

Maternal, umbilical, and neonatal plasma tenofovir concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and analyzed using a population approach. Data were described using a two-compartment model for the mother, an effect compartment linked to maternal circulation for cord, and a neonatal compartment disconnected after delivery. Absorption was greater for women delivering by caesarian section than for those delivering vaginally. The maternal 600 mg TDF administration before delivery produces the same concentrations as 300 mg administration in other adults. If the time elapsed between maternal administration and delivery is >or=12 h, two tablets of TDF-FTC should be readministered. Tenofovir showed good placental transfer (60%). Administering 13 mg/kg of TDF as soon as possible after birth should produce neonatal concentrations comparable with those observed in adults."
4611,0.003,3.0,"In the United States, transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) from health care exposures has been considered uncommon. However, a review of outbreak information revealed 33 outbreaks in nonhospital health care settings in the past decade: 12 in outpatient clinics, 6 in hemodialysis centers, and 15 in long-term care facilities, resulting in 448 persons acquiring HBV or HCV infection. In each setting, the putative mechanism of infection was patient-to-patient transmission through failure of health care personnel to adhere to fundamental principles of infection control and aseptic technique (for example, reuse of syringes or lancing devices). Difficult to detect and investigate, these recognized outbreaks indicate a wider and growing problem as health care is increasingly provided in outpatient settings in which infection control training and oversight may be inadequate. A comprehensive approach involving better viral hepatitis surveillance and case investigation, health care provider education and training, professional oversight, licensing, and public awareness is needed to ensure that patients are always afforded basic levels of protection against viral hepatitis transmission."

Twenty-one percent had a history of injection drug use, 12% were unemployed, and 18% had Medicaid insurance.

Participants answered a sociodemographic questionnaire and were tested by scales assessing sociocognitive variables. Adherence to treatment was assessed by a self-report inventory developed for the study. Clinical information was obtained from the patients' records. Significance tests were conducted using univariate logistic regressions followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 195 patients participated in the study and 56.9% of them reported > or = 95% adherence on the previous two days. In univariate analysis, the odds of adherence increased with self-efficacy (a person's conviction that he/she can successfully execute the behavior required to produce a certain desired outcome) in taking medications as prescribed (OR = 3.50, 95% CI 1.90-6.55), and decreased with perception of negative affect and physical concerns (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.95). The odds were lower for taking antiretroviral medications >4 times a day (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.20-0.94) and higher for patients with 8 years of schooling (OR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.12-4.66). In the multivariate analysis, self-efficacy (OR = 3.33, 95% CI 1.69-6.56) and taking medication >4 times a day (OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.80) were independently associated with adherence. Self-efficacy was the most important predictor of adherence, followed by number of times antiretroviral medication was taken per day.

In 2006, more new AIDS cases among black MSM were diagnosed in the South than in all other U.S. census regions combined. In November 2007, the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) reported to CDC an increase in the number of young black MSM who received diagnoses of HIV infection at a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Jackson, Mississippi. MSDH and CDC conducted a survey of 29 young black MSM in the three-county Jackson area who received diagnoses of HIV infection during January 2006--April 2008 to characterize risk behavior and HIV testing behavior. This report summarizes the results of that survey, which found that, during the 12 months before receiving their HIV infection diagnosis, 20 (69%) of the 29 participants had unprotected anal intercourse, but only three (10%) of the 29 thought they were likely or very likely to acquire HIV infection in their lifetimes. Additional investigations are needed to determine whether this sample is illustrative of other groups of black MSM at high risk for HIV infection, especially in the South. Targeted interventions that decrease HIV risk behaviors among black MSM should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to reduce HIV transmission."
6681,0.003,3.0,"It is still controversial whether viral hepatitis co-infection can influence antiretroviral plasma drug concentrations and whether drug concentrations are correlated with liver enzyme elevations during highly active antiretroviral therapy. An analysis of data from a cohort of 220 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients was conducted. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were performed to identify predictors of plasma drug concentrations. The association of transaminase elevation with higher plasma drug concentrations was explored following stratification of patients into HIV monoinfected and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and/or hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infected groups. Hepatitis co-infections were independently correlated with drug concentrations above the therapeutic cut-offs at Week 1 (P=0.06), Week 4 (P=0.04) and Week 12 (P=0.005). The apparent effect was independent of the possible impact exerted by other variables such as demographics and medication adherence. The incidence of relevant hypertransaminasaemia was low. Patients with hepatitis co-infections had higher rates of transaminase elevation than monoinfected HIV patients; however, risk of transaminase elevation was not associated with drug concentrations. The presence of HCV and/or HBV co-infections correlated with higher plasma drug concentrations, although it did not appear to influence hepatotoxicity risk."

Thirty-two patients (86%; one missing response) still depended on an adult to remember taking their medication, among whom 28 relied on a female relative. Although 18 (47%) patients reported to become ill no more than once a year, only 10 (26%) patients showed an undetectable viral load, and 4 (11%) patients showed no CD4 suppression. Seventeen (45%) patients recalled correctly their medication. During the week prior to the interview, 26 patients (68%) reported that they had missed at least one dose.

HIV, HBV, and HCV markers were tested by commercial assays. Virus genotyping was carried out by sequencing the protease and reverse transcriptase-encoding region (PR-RT region) for HIV and a region encompassing the NS5B gene for HCV and subsequent phylogenetic analysis.Twelve over 14 HIV-subtyped inmates were infected with HIV-1 subtype B strains. The 2 non-B strains belonged to subtype G and CRF02_AG, in an Italian and a Gambian patient, respectively. Variants carrying the K103N and Y181C resistance mutations to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) were found in 2 out of 9 patients naive for combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) (22.2%). Most HIV-positive patients (92.8%) showed evidence of past or present HBV and/or HCV infection. Prevalence of HBV and HCV was 81.2% for both viruses, whereas prevalence of HBV/HCV coinfection was 69.6%. A significantly higher presence of HCV infection was found in Italians [odds ratio (OR) 11.0; interval 1.7-80.9] and in drug users (OR 27.8; interval 4.9-186.0). HCV subtypes were determined in 42 HCV or HBV/HCV-coinfected individuals. HCV subtypes 1a, 3a, 4d, and 1b were found in 42.9%, 40.5%, 14.3%, and 2.4% of inmates, respectively. Low titers of HBV DNA in HBV DNA positive subjects precluded HBV subtyping.The high prevalence of HBV and HCV coinfections in HIV-infected inmates, as well as the heterogeneity of HIV and HCV subtypes suggest the need to adopt systematic controls in prisons to monitor both the burden and the genetic forms of blood-borne viral infections, in order to apply targeted therapeutic interventions."
7265,0.003,3.0,"In the USA, Black males are disproportionately affected by community violence and HIV. The aim of this study was to assess whether exposures to community violence are related to psychological distress, drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and medication adherence among a sample of HIV-positive young Black men who had sex with men (YBMSM). Data are from 98 YBMSM ages 18-29 years recruited from Chicago who completed measures on demographics, exposures to community violence, psychological distress, drug use, condomless anal intercourse, and medication adherence. Rates of exposure to community violence were high and youth reported victimization and witnessing numerous types of violence in their lifetime. In adjusted logistic regression analyses, models indicate that YBMSM reporting higher levels of exposure to community violence had significantly higher rates of condomless anal intercourse in the previous 6 months (AOR: 5.33, 95%CI: 1.38-20.55). Additionally, exposure to community violence was positively associated with psychological distress, hard drug use, and use of marijuana as a sex drug. Adherence to HIV antiretroviral medication was negatively associated with community violence (AOR: 0.36, 95%CI: 0.13-0.97). Rates of exposure to community violence are especially high in urban communities. Overall findings suggest that treatment, intervention, and programmatic approaches that include initiatives to address exposure to community violence might correlate with better health-related outcomes for HIV-positive YBMSM."
524,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) continue to be major health concerns among men who have sex with men (MSM). The Internet both facilitates high-risk sexual encounters and provides opportunities for promoting healthy behaviours. This study compared self-reported HAV and HBV vaccination levels, based on demographics, health characteristics, hepatitis knowledge, attitudes and risk behaviours among MSM using an online survey posted from February through June 2005. Each participant (n = 968) reported whether they were vaccinated, infected or susceptible for hepatitis A and/or for hepatitis B. Men whose health-care provider recommended vaccination were 12.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.11, 20.55) times more likely to be vaccinated against HAV and 17.93 (95% CI 10.82, 29.70) times more likely to be vaccinated against HBV than those at risk of infection, respectively. These data provide essential information for public health professionals to successfully promote vaccination among members of this population."
3158,0.003,3.0,"A case-control study was undertaken to determine risk factors for lactic acidosis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients treated with nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). From May 1996 to June 2000, 9 patients with lactic acidosis (defined as a plasma lactic acid level of >5 mM and plasma pH of <7.38) were identified. Control patients were randomly selected from among a large cohort of patients who initiated a dual NRTI regimen in 1996 or after. Two factors were associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis: first, a creatinine clearance of <70 mL/min before lactic acidosis (OR, 15.8 [range, 3.0-86.5], P<10(-4)), and, second, a low nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count before the inception of NRTI therapy (OR, 8.4 [range, 1.2-infinity], P=.03). The total cumulative exposure to NRTIs was not associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, nor was the cumulative exposure to any of the 4 NRTIs studied. According to these results, monitoring of creatinine clearance, especially in patients with a low nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count, could lead to modifications in antiretroviral therapy in order to diminish the risk of occurrence of lactic acidosis."
7725,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a blood-borne pathogen that has a worldwide distribution and infects millions of people. Care-associated HCV infections represented a huge part of hepatitis C burden in the past via contaminated blood and unsafe injections and continue to be a serious problem of public health. The present review proposes a panorama of health care-associated HCV infections via the three mode of contamination that have been identified: (1) infected patient to non-infected patient; (2) infected patient to non-infected health care worker (HCW); and (3) infected HCW to non infected patient. For each condition, the circumstances of contamination are described together with the means to prevent them. As a whole, the more important risk is represented by unsafe practices regarding injections, notably with the improper use of multidose vials used for multiple patients. The questions of occupational exposures and infected HCWs are also discussed. In terms of prevention and surveillance, the main arm for combating care-associated HCV infections is the implementation of standard precautions in all the fields of cares, with training programs and audits to verify their good application. HCWs must be sensitized to the risk of blood-borne pathogens, notably by the use of safety devices for injections and good hygiene practices in the operating theatre and in all the invasive procedures. The providers performing exposed-prone procedures must monitor their HCV serology regularly in order to detect early any primary infection and to treat it without delay. With the need to stay vigilant because HCV infection is often a hidden risk, it can be hoped that the number of people infected by HCV via health care will decrease very significantly in the next years.

A cross-sectional study of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels was conducted among HIV-1-infected Thai patients to determine the prevalence and associated factors of low vitamin D levels (25[OH]D <30 ng/mL) in tropical setting. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D was measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Of 178 patients, 58% received antiretroviral therapy at median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of 7.4 (5.9-8.5) years. The prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) and insufficiency (20-29.9 ng/mL) was 26.8% and 44.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that receiving efavirenz (EFV) was significantly associated with low vitamin D status (odds ratio = 3.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-12.15, P <.05). The mean (±standard deviation) level of 25(OH)D in patients receiving and not receiving EFV was 22.9 (6.6) and 28.6 (10.7) ng/mL, respectively, (P <.05). Low vitamin D status is common and needs to be assessed among HIV-infected patients including tropical residents especially when EFV is used."
7308,0.003,3.0,"Qualitative and quantitative approaches were used in a rural hospital of Cameroon to assess how much nursing personnel know about and practise in regard to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), and to determine health service factors that influence knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). Participants included 107 nursing and laboratory staff and 62 patients with AIDS. Self-administered questionnaires were used for nurses, and close-ended questionnaires were administered to patients with AIDS (as a verification tool for staff responses). Focus group discussions (FGD) held with nurse supervisors evaluated health service factors that influence KAP. Overall, 70.1% of the nurses who responded scored highly in the knowledge section compared to 50.5% in the attitude and practice section. There were several outstanding misconceptions and malpractices about HIV/AIDS. Knowledge, but not attitude, was significantly influenced by the grade of the staff (P< 0.001 and P = 0.17, respectively). Approximately 15% of 62 patients with AIDS indicated that they were attended to with signs of disgust and/or hatred. The major health service factors thought to influence KAP, confirmed by many in all the FGD, included: the lack of adequate information; the lack of commitment to alter attitudes and practices; the lack of in-service promotions; and the ongoing fear of becoming infected with the virus through caring for patients with AIDS. Low income also seemed to have an influence on KAP. Therefore, it is imperative that ongoing education programmes are provided for nurses to enable them to meet the needs of the increasing HIV prevalence in our community. Information, education and communication, and compliance with international working norms, remain essential tools in the control of HIV/AIDS spread in our hospital settings."

Chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB) is considered as an important potential risk factors for HCC. Different people have diverse responses to HBV infection regarding the likelihood of HCC development, and host factors such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) might account for this. The present study was conducted to evaluate any association between SNP frequencies in two genes, XRCC4 (rs1805377) and ATF6 (rs2070150), and the risk of CHB and HCC development in Thai patients. The study covered 369 subjects including 121 HCC patients, 141 with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB) and 107 healthy controls. With TaqMan real-time PCR, the results showed that no significant association between XRCC4 (rs1805377) and ATF6 (rs2070150) and risk of HCC in the Thai population. From this first study of the 2 polymorphisms and HCC in Thailand it can concluded that rs1805377 and rs2070150 polymorphisms may not be applicable as genetic markers in the Thai population for HCC assessment.

2776,0.003,3.0,"We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of a PCR-based qualitative test for the rapid diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium-M. intracellulare complex (MAC) bacteremia in patients with AIDS disease. Eleven subjects with newly culture-proven MAC bacteremia had the following tests performed at biweekly intervals during the first 8 weeks of therapy: blood culture, Mycobacterium-specific PCR, and quantitative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral-load testing. Mycobacterium genus-specific biotinylated primers were used to amplify a sequence of approximately 582 nucleotides within the 16S rRNA genes of M. avium and M. intracellulare. Detection of the amplified product was performed with an oligonucleotide probe-coated microwell plate combined with an avidin-horseradish peroxidase-tetramethylbenzidine conjugate-substrate system. While not as sensitive as BACTEC culture, PCR detected 17 of 18 specimens which grew >/=40 organisms/ml (94.4% sensitivity) and 9 of 16 specimens which grew </=40 organisms/ml (56.3% sensitivity). No clear change in HIV viremia occurred in response to successful treatment of patients' MAC bacteremia. Use of the PCR test allowed detection of MAC bacteremia in 1 day, with a sensitivity similar to those of quantitative blood culture techniques, and it may prove useful for rapid screening of suspected cases. HIV viremia was unaffected by 8 weeks of MAC therapy."
9450,0.003,3.0,"We assessed the intralaboratory reproducibility of a system for sequencing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) by using replicate subanalyses of 46 plasma samples collected from HIV-1-infected, antiretroviral-experienced patients in order to determine the relative contributions of the different procedural steps to final sequence variability. Complete sequence concordance between duplicates of each sample was 99.4%. Complete and partial mismatches occurred scattered throughout the PR-RT genome segment at >300 positions. Approximately 75% of the discordances involved mixtures, some of which appeared at key resistance sites. Most differences were the result of the first-round RT-PCR procedure. Inter-rater concordance for sequence analysis and assembly was >99.9%. There was no observed correlation between the number or frequency of mismatches and plasma viral loads. A separate longitudinal analysis of a single routine control sample sequenced 103 times over 9 months consistently gave highly reproducible sequences (median percentage of nucleotide discordances, 0.04%; range, 0 to 0.2%). Finally, sequence data from 168 sequential samples collected from 22 patients with long-term, predominantly wild type HIV showed that intrapatient nucleotide concordance with individual index sequences ranged from 96.5 to 100%. Together, these results confirm that sequence-based genotyping can be a precise and reliable tool for monitoring HIV drug resistance, and they suggest that efforts to reduce variability should focus on the first RT-PCR step. Consequently, the data suggest that the composition of external quality assessment panels should be based on clinical HIV isolates rather than DNA clones."
8359,0.003,3.0,"Gene therapeutic strategies for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection could potentially overcome the limitations of standard antiretroviral drug therapy (ART). However, in none of the clinical gene therapy trials published to date, therapeutic levels of genetic protection have been achieved in the target cell population for HIV-1. To improve systemic antiviral efficacy, C peptides, which are efficient inhibitors of HIV-1 entry, were engineered for high-level secretion by genetically modified cells. The size restrictions for efficient peptide export through the secretory pathway were overcome by expressing the C peptides as concatemers, which were processed into monomers by furin protease cleavage. These secreted antiviral entry inhibitory (SAVE) peptides mediated a substantial protective bystander effect on neighboring nonmodified cells, thus suppressing virus replication even if only a small fraction of cells was genetically modified. Accordingly, these SAVE peptides may provide a strong benefit to AIDS patients in future, and, if applied by direct in vivo gene delivery, could present an effective alternative to antiretroviral drug regimen."
6789,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) patient isolates and molecular clones were used to analyze the determinants responsible for human CD4(+) thymocyte depletion in SCID-hu mice. Non-syncytium-inducing, R5 or R3R5 HIV-1 isolates from asymptomatic infected people showed little or no human CD4(+) thymocyte depletion in SCID-hu mice, while syncytium-inducing (SI), R5X4 or R3R5X4 HIV-1 isolates from the same individuals, isolated just prior to the onset of AIDS, rapidly and efficiently eliminated CD4-bearing human thymocytes. We have mapped the ability of one SI HIV-1 isolate to eliminate CD4(+) human cells in SCID-hu mice to a region of the env gene including the three most amino-terminal variable regions (V1 to V3). We find that for all of the HIV-1 isolates that we studied, a nonlinear relationship exists between viral replication and the depletion of CD4(+) cells. This relationship can best be described mathematically with a Hill-type plot indicating that a threshold level of viral replication, at which cytopathic effects begin to be seen, exists for HIV-1 infection of thymus/liver grafts in SCID-hu mice. This threshold level is 1 copy of viral DNA for every 11 cells (95% confidence interval = 1 copy of HIV-1 per 67 cells to 1 copy per 4 cells). Furthermore, while SI viruses more frequently achieve this level of replication, replication above this threshold level correlates best with cytopathic effects in this model system. We used GHOST cells to map the coreceptor specificity and relative entry efficiency of these early- and late-stage patient isolates of HIV-1. Our studies show that coreceptor specificity and entry efficiency are critical determinants of HIV-1 pathogenesis in vivo."
8316,0.003,3.0,"In contrast to HIV-infected humans, naturally SIV-infected sooty mangabeys (SMs) very rarely progress to AIDS. Although the mechanisms underlying this disease resistance are unknown, a consistent feature of natural SIV infection is the absence of the generalized immune activation associated with HIV infection. To define the correlates of preserved CD4(+) T cell counts in SMs, we conducted a cross-sectional immunological study of 110 naturally SIV-infected SMs. The nonpathogenic nature of the infection was confirmed by an average CD4(+) T cell count of 1,076 +/- 589/mm(3) despite chronic infection with a highly replicating virus. No correlation was found between CD4(+) T cell counts and either age (used as a surrogate marker for length of infection) or viremia. The strongest correlates of preserved CD4(+) T cell counts were a low percentage of circulating effector T cells (CD28(-)CD95(+) and/or IL-7R/CD127(-)) and a high percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells. These findings support the hypothesis that the level of immune activation is a key determinant of CD4(+) T cell counts in SIV-infected SMs. Interestingly, we identified 14 animals with CD4(+) T cell counts of <500/mm(3), of which two show severe and persistent CD4(+) T cell depletion (<50/mm(3)). Thus, significant CD4(+) T cell depletion does occasionally follow SIV infection of SMs even in the context of generally low levels of immune activation, lending support to the hypothesis of multifactorial control of CD4(+) T cell homeostasis in this model of infection. The absence of AIDS in these ""CD4(low)"" naturally SIV-infected SMs defines a protective role of the reduced immune activation even in the context of a significant CD4(+) T cell depletion."
5289,0.003,3.0,"More than 500,000 people die each year from the liver diseases that result from chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Therapeutic vaccines, which aim to elicit an immune response capable of controlling the virus, offer a potential new treatment strategy for chronic hepatitis B. Recently, an evolved, high-titer vaccine platform consisting of Semliki Forest virus RNA replicons that express the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) has been described. This platform generates virus-like vesicles (VLVs) that contain VSV G but no other viral structural proteins. We report here that the evolved VLV vector engineered to additionally express the HBV middle surface envelope glycoprotein (MHBs) induces functional CD8 T cell responses in mice. These responses were greater in magnitude and broader in specificity than those obtained with other immunization strategies, including recombinant protein and DNA. Additionally, a single immunization with VLV-MHBs protected mice from HBV hydrodynamic challenge, and this protection correlated with the elicitation of a CD8 T cell recall response. In contrast to MHBs, a VLV expressing HBV core protein (HBcAg) neither induced a CD8 T cell response in mice nor protected against challenge. Finally, combining DNA and VLV-MHBs immunization led to induction of HBV-specific CD8 T cell responses in a transgenic mouse model of chronic HBV infection. The ability of VLV-MHBs to induce a multispecific T cell response capable of controlling HBV replication, and to generate immune responses in a tolerogenic model of chronic infection, indicates that VLV vaccine platforms may offer a unique strategy for HBV therapeutic vaccination."
792,0.003,3.0,"Liver biopsy remains the gold standard in the assessment of severity of liver disease. Noninvasive tests have gained popularity to predict histology in view of the associated risks of biopsy. However, many models include tests not readily available, and there are limited data from patients with HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. We aimed to develop a model using routine tests to predict liver fibrosis in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection. A retrospective analysis of liver histology was performed in 832 patients. Liver fibrosis was assessed via Ishak score; patients were categorized as 0-1, 2-3, or 4-6 and were randomly assigned to training (n = 555) or validation (n = 277) sets. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that platelet count (PLT), age, AST, and INR were significantly associated with fibrosis. Additional analysis revealed PLT, age, AST, and ALT as an alternative model. Based on this, a simple index (FIB-4) was developed: age ([yr] x AST [U/L]) / ((PLT [10(9)/L]) x (ALT [U/L])(1/2)). The AUROC of the index was 0.765 for differentiation between Ishak stage 0-3 and 4-6. At a cutoff of <1.45 in the validation set, the negative predictive value to exclude advanced fibrosis (stage 4-6) was 90% with a sensitivity of 70%. A cutoff of >3.25 had a positive predictive value of 65% and a specificity of 97%. Using these cutoffs, 87% of the 198 patients with FIB-4 values outside 1.45-3.25 would be correctly classified, and liver biopsy could be avoided in 71% of the validation group. In conclusion, noninvasive tests can accurately predict hepatic fibrosis and may reduce the need for liver biopsy in the majority of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients."
1096,0.003,3.0,"U.S. AIDS rates have declined among same population groups; however, African-Americans and other ethnic minorities have experienced the least amount of decline. As a result medical and public health authorities are tasked with developing strategies to help eliminate the disparity in HIV/AIDS incidence rate and clinical outcomes. Thus, in 1999, the National Minority AIDS Education and Training Center (NMAETC) was developed to facilitate training, clinical consultation and technical assistance to clinicians that provide care to HIV-infected minority patients. Its initial activities were designed solely to increase providers' clinical capacity to use state-of-art anti-retroviral therapies to treat and manage the disease. However, through focused discussions with target providers and a survey of medical care service sites, the NMAETC confirms that provider' training and assistance needs extend into non-medical domains."

To understand the distribution of baseline CD4 and factors associated with late antiretroviral therapy (ART) access, the National Free ART Database was retrospectively reviewed and a total of 49,321 HIV/AIDS patients were identified in this study based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) age ≥18; (2) initiated HAART between 1 July, 2006 and 31 December, 2009; (3) have recorded baseline CD4 cell count. This study showed that although both the median and mean baseline CD4 increased consistently over the study period, there were still about 30% of HIV/AIDS patients accessing ART at a very late stage (CD4 ≤ 50 µl) in 2009. Risk factors for late ART access included being male, single, having a short time interval between HIV diagnosis and treatment, and being infected through heterosexual contact. Being infected through injection drug use and homosexual contact were protective. Transmission route and marriage status showed different effects in a gender stratified analysis. A strengthened HIV testing and screening program is the key to improving the accessibility of ART and populations that are vulnerable to sexual transmission of HIV should be the primary target of the program."
2623,0.003,3.0,"Reports of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in seronegative individuals prompted the authors to investigate subjects who are at very high risk of acquisition of HIV in San Francisco. Nine HIV seronegative subjects were evaluated extensively, eight of whom were drawn from a well-characterized cohort of seropositive and seronegative homosexual men who have been followed prospectively since 1983-1984. These men have calculated probabilities of infection based on a fitted model of between 0.22 and 0.94. One additional subject is an intravenous drug user who has shared needles with HIV-infected individuals extensively. Peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes were separately cultured from each subject and evidence of HIV infection was sought by a reverse transcriptase assay, enzyme immunoassay, and immunocytofluorographic analysis for HIV antigens, in situ hybridization, RNA slot blot analysis, and polymerase chain reaction amplification of HIV cDNA. Uncultured monocytes and lymphocytes from each donor were also examined by these techniques. Evidence of HIV infection was not found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of these high risk individuals."

In this study, the aim was to evaluate the vaccination coverage and immunity against HBV among HIV-infected individuals in South Brazil, and identify factors that are associated with compliance patterns and antibody reactivity. Three hundred HIV-infected men and women were included in this survey. The patients answered a standardized questionnaire, and vaccination cards were checked in order to assess hepatitis B vaccine status. A blood sample was collected for quantitative determination of antibody to hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBs). Participants were also evaluated for their CD4 cell count and HIV viral load. The overall vaccination coverage of HBV vaccination found in this study (57.4%) was lower than that was previously reported in South Brazil. Anti-HBs levels >10IU/L were observed in 47.0% of the studied population. A significant inequality in the coverage rates and antibody reactivity was found in favor of patients with better economic status. In conclusion, the results indicate the need for improvement in the HBV vaccination coverage among HIV carriers, in particular focusing on low-income individuals. "
8561,0.003,3.0,"In the United States, most reported cases of hepatitis B occur in adults as a result of behavioural, lifestyle, or occupational exposures, but a significant number of children also become infected in well defined settings. Although only 1-3% of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections occur in children under 5 years of age, they account for 20-30% of all chronic infections. A new strategy for HBV prevention in the USA includes integration of HBV vaccine into childhood immunisation schedules. Vaccination strategies that target high risk groups have not been effective. To determine the frequency and severity of community acquired chronic hepatitis C, patients with acute non-A, non-B hepatitis identified in four sentinel counties in the United States were followed prospectively. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was found in 106 (82%) of 130 patients. Ninety three per cent of the HCV positive patients had a risk factor for their infection: 59% parenteral, 6% sexual or household, and 28% low socioeconomic level. Chronic hepatitis developed in 62%, independently of the risk factor for infection. HCV-RNA persisted in most patients, including those with biochemical resolution of their hepatitis. This study suggests that HCV may be a major cause of liver disease and persistent viraemia in the United States."

There were 210 subjects (10.1%) who had antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV), 76 (3.7%) to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), and 9 (0.4%) to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). By multivariate analysis, anti-HAV seropositivity was independently associated with age, non-white racial/ethnic groups, birth outside of the United States, and prior Caribbean deployment for less than 1 year. Anti-HBc seropositivity was independently associated with black and Filipino race/ethnicity, foreign birth, a history of a sexually transmitted disease, South Pacific/Indian Ocean deployment (less than 12 months), and South Pacific or Mediterranean duty for (greater than 1 year). No geographic risk factors were associated with anti-HCV positivity. These data indicate that military personnel deployed outside the United States are at increased risk of viral hepatitis infection and should be considered for vaccination."
4240,0.003,3.0,"Highly active antiretroviral treatment is compromised by viral resistance mutations. Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is therefore monitored closely, but follow-up studies of these patients are limited. Virus from 1405 individuals diagnosed with HIV-1 in Denmark between 2001 and 2009 was analyzed for TDR, and molecular-epidemiological links and progression of the infection were described based on data from standardized questionnaires, the prospective Danish HIV Cohort Study, and by phylogenetic analysis. Eighty-five individuals were found to be infected with virus harboring mutations resulting in a prevalence of 6.1%, with no changes over time. The main resistance mutations were nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation 215 revertants, as well as nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation 103N/S and protease inhibitor (PI) mutations 90M and 85V. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed 12 transmission chains involving 37 TDR individuals. Of these 21 were also documented epidemiologically. The virus included in the transmission chain carried similar resistance mutations to the TDR index case, whereas controls chains from index cases without TDR were generally without resistance mutations. We observed no difference in progression of the infection between individuals infected with TDR and individuals infected with wild-type HIV-1. The prevalence of TDR is low in Denmark and transmission of dual-drug-resistant HIV-1 is infrequent. The TDR isolates were shown to originate from local patients failing therapy."
2043,0.003,3.0,"In an effort to understand the contribution of the primer-binding site (PBS) region to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication, we have constructed a mutant HIV proviral DNA with an alteration in the 5' end of the PBS. The PBS mutant proviral DNA was characterized by transfection of the viral DNA into CD4+ and non-CD4+ target cells. The results indicate that mutation in the PBS reduced the level of viral particles released into the medium of transfected cells in comparison to wild-type proviral DNA. The viral particles were noninfectious upon transmission to established CD4+ cell lines and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Electron microscopic analysis of the transfected cells revealed no abnormalities in the structure of the virion directed by the mutant proviral DNA. Also, the protein and RNA contents of the mutant virions were similar to the wild type. The quantitation of intracellular viral structural protein in the transfected cells, however, indicated that the PBS mutation may have an effect on the assembly of viral particles in addition to completely abolishing reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA. These results provide evidence that the PBS region of the viral genome has multiple functions in HIV-1 replication."
8603,0.003,3.0,"Treatment with lamivudine of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) results in a high rate of drug resistance, which is primarily associated with the rtM204I/V substitution in the HBV reverse transcriptase domain. Here we show that the rtM204I/V substitution, although essential, is insufficient for establishing resistance against lamivudine. The analysis of 639 HBV whole-genome sequences obtained from 11 patients shows that rtM204I/V is independently acquired by more than one intra-host HBV variant, indicating the convergent nature of lamivudine resistance. The differential capacity of HBV variants to develop drug resistance suggests that fitness effects of drug-resistance mutations depend on the genetic structure of the HBV genome. An analysis of Bayesian networks that connect rtM204I/V to many sites of HBV proteins confirms that lamivudine resistance is a complex trait encoded by the entire HBV genome rather than by a single mutation. These findings have implications for public health and offer a more general framework for understanding drug resistance."
4936,0.003,3.0,"The roles of nucleoside analogues and protease inhibitors (PIs) in the development of metabolic complications and fat-distribution abnormalities associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are not well known. We performed an observational study in which efavirenz was substituted for a PI for 41 patients receiving HAART who had prolonged virus suppression, clinical signs of severe lipoatrophy, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. Clinical follow-up was performed for 1 year. Virus suppression was maintained in most of the patients, and a significant increase in CD4(+) lymphocyte count was observed, but no change in lipid profile or insulin resistance was observed. Abdominal fat content did not change, and subcutaneous fat depletion was even more pronounced >1 year after the switch. We conclude that, for PI-treated patients who present with lipoatrophy, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance, substituting efavirenz for PIs can maintain virus suppression and immunologic response to HAART, but it does not improve the lipid profile or resolve insulin resistance or lipoatrophy."

Between June 2000 and September 2002, 1,480 participants (1,183 HIV-infected persons and 297 controls) were enrolled in FRAM. Measurements taken included whole-body magnetic resonance imaging for quantification of regional fat, anthropometric measurements, central laboratory analysis of metabolites, and assessment of symptoms, sociodemographic factors, and lifestyle. Similar measurements were repeated among FRAM participants 4 years later (FRAM 2) for investigation of the progression of fat distribution changes, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. In FRAM 2, which is ongoing, investigators are also determining the associations of subclinical cardiovascular disease, as measured by carotid intimal-medial wall thickness, with HIV infection, fat distribution changes, insulin resistance, and other proatherogenic changes in serum lipid levels. The demographic characteristics of HIV-infected FRAM men and women were comparable to those reported from a national random sampling of HIV-infected men and women receiving medical care in the United States. The representativeness of the FRAM sample increases its value as a resource for studies on fat distribution, metabolic changes, and atherosclerosis in HIV infection."
8912,0.003,3.0,"The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in the mid-1990s led to a dramatic reduction in mortality and progression to AIDS, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)infection has now turned into a chronic disease with improved survival and prognosis. Hence, patients with well-controlled HIV infection are no longer prevented from receiving transplants, but treatment must be based on knowledge of pharmacokinetics for the drugs involved. The common approach measuring the cyclosporine level after 2 h or trough level is misleading and it was necessary to determine the area under the curve."

33,0.003,3.0,"We report on the frequency of genetic mutations associated with drug resistance in antiretroviral treatment-naive patients from Martinique (French West Indies), where zidovudine (ZDV) has been available since 1987 and where combination therapy developed simultaneously with its use in continental France. Genotypic resistance was studied in plasma HIV RNA from samples collected between 1988 and 1998 from 70 antiretroviral-naive study subjects, half presenting with either primary infection or documented seroconversion. A line probe assay (LIPA) was used to detect substitutions on the reverse transcriptase (RT) codons 41, 69, 70, 74, 184, and 215. Direct sequencing was used to complete the data for RT codons which were uninterpretable by LIPA. Of these patients, 17 harbored mutated viruses with one or more mutations in the RT gene codons analyzed. ZDV resistance mutations T215Y/F, M41L, and K70R were found in 2, 5, and 12 individuals, respectively. Mutant strains L74V (didanosine [ddI] and dideoxycytidine [ddC]) were detected in 3 patients and M184V (lamivudine/ddI/ddC) in 4 patients. However, pure mutant results at one or more codons of interest were observed in only 5 (7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1%-13%) patients, all involving ZDV resistance. One carried both mutations T215Y and M41L known to confer a high degree of phenotypic resistance to ZDV. Among a subgroup of 28 patients with a timepoint of infection after 1995, 24 [86%; approximately 95% CI, 73%-99%) presented with a wild-type pattern. The significance of the high prevalence of mixed patterns observed in drug-naive patients remains unclear. However, the frequency of primary mutant genotypes associated with high levels of drug resistance is low in Martinique and in this study we did not observe any currently increased tendency in this frequency."
7925,0.003,3.0,"An international group of experienced hepatologists and virologists conducted a single-day workshop to review the management of patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving treatment with oral nucleosides or nucleotides. Guidelines regarding on-treatment management and available published data on the importance of serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA as a marker of outcomes were reviewed. On-treatment monitoring strategies to define early virologic responses that might be predictive of better outcomes and a reduced risk of viral resistance were proposed for further study. This treatment plan, labeled the roadmap concept, recommends monitoring of serum HBV DNA levels to identify outcomes of therapy. Primary treatment failure was defined as a reduction of serum HBV DNA levels by less than 1 log10 IU/mL from baseline at week 12. Measurement of the HBV DNA level at week 24 was considered essential to characterize virologic responses as complete, partial, or inadequate. Complete virologic response was defined as negative HBV DNA by a sensitive assay (<60 IU/mL or <300 copies/mL); partial virologic response was defined as HBV DNA levels less than 2000 IU/mL (4 log10 copies/mL), and inadequate virologic response was defined as HBV DNA levels of 2000 IU/mL or greater (4 log10 copies/mL). Strategies are proposed for managing patients in each of these categories, depending in part on the rapidity with which HBV DNA suppression is achieved and the emergence of genotypic mutations that reduce the effectiveness of a specific drug. Future studies of the use of the roadmap concept in improving outcomes of chronic hepatitis B are warranted."
6666,0.003,3.0,"Mother-to-child transmission of HIV accounts for 90% of paediatric HIV. The objective of this paper is to assess the outcome of preventing mother-to-child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), using highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). All pregnant women booking for antenatal care at the university of Maiduguri teaching hospital received voluntary counselling and testing for HIV. All HIV-positive mothers were placed on HAART for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. All exposed babies received single dose nevirapine within 72 h of birth and zidovudine syrup for 6 weeks. The babies were then tested for viral DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at 6 and 12 weeks of age. Among 5,461 mothers screened for HIV during the study period, 695 (12.7%) were confirmed HIV-positive. Out of 446 mother-baby pairs followed up to a minimum period of 6 months postpartum, only five (1.1%) babies were HIV-positive."
365,0.003,3.0,"Previous studies of risk factors for hepatitis B virus infection among hospital employees have been based on surveys in single institutions or have been analyzed with univariate techniques. From November 1980 through August 1981, the authors performed a multi-institutional seroepidemiologic survey of hospital employees screened for entrance into a hepatitis B vaccine trial who represented groups at high risk for hepatitis B infection. Using a logistic regression model for the analysis of risk factors, the investigators determined the relative odds and 95% confidence intervals for risk of hepatitis B infection to be as follows: race (nonwhite/white: 3.4; 2.4-4.8) (p less than 0.001); history of acute viral hepatitis of an unspecified type (3.6; 2.2-5.9) (p less than 0.001); and employment at hospitals 1 through 5 as compared with hospital 6 (1.8; 1.1-2.9) (p = 0.015). In addition, certain job categories and the duration of employment within some of these categories were associated with increasing risk for hepatitis B infection over time. Laboratory workers (1.4; 1.2-1.7), surgical staff (1.2; 1.1-1.4), and medical staff (1.3; 1.1-1.5) had significant (p less than 0.05) increased risk of prior infection with longer duration of employment. Such time-job interaction was not demonstrable for nursing staff, anesthesiology staff, dental personnel, pathology staff, or ancillary personnel. The logistic regression model also shows that the highest gradient of risk for laboratory workers, surgeons, and medical staff occurs during the first five years of employment. An effective preventive strategy, such as the use of hepatitis B vaccine, should be targeted for these groups at the time of initial employment."
6842,0.003,3.0,"Two cross-sectional surveys on hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were carried out among 1,033 volunteer first-time blood donors in five blood banks (3 private, 2 public) and among 201 prisoners in the Penitentiary Center of Industrial Activity, in Goiania, Central Brazil, between June 1988 and February 1989. Those surveys were part of a major study designed to estimate seroprevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBsAg markers by ELISA test, and to study risk factors associated with seropositivity. The presence of any serum marker was considered as previous exposure to HBV. A standard questionnaire was applied to both populations to evaluate previous blood transfusion, number of sexual partners, homo/bisexual activity, history of sexually transmitted diseases, drug abusers, use of parenteral medicine, acupuncture, tattooing and VDRL seropositivity. Seroprevalence varied from 12.8% to 26.4% in blood donors and prisoners, respectively, (p less than 0.05) and increased with age (X2 trend=14.0 p less than 0.05%). Prisoners had higher percentages of all risk factors investigated than blood donors, with the exception of number of sexual partners. Among all risk factors studied, age, imprisonment and tattooing were statistically associated with seropositivity, even after multivariate analysis controlling for age and reclusion. The paper discusses the methodologic issues related to this epidemiologic investigation."
633,0.003,3.0,"We report the case of two patients in whom acute hepatitis A was associated with a marked and prolonged increase in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral load. Although in one patient the rise in HIV-1 RNA might also have been related to the interruption of antiretroviral therapy, we also observed a similar pattern in the other patient who had a stable undetectable plasma viraemia prior to acute hepatitis and never received treatment with anti-retrovirals. Our observation supports the hypothesis that immune activation that is induced by acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection may trigger HIV-1 replication. This highlights the importance of maintaining antiretroviral therapy throughout the acute phase of hepatitis A and of preventing HAV infection through active immunization."
3384,0.003,3.0,"An unusual hepatitis B virus (HBV) variant, assigned provisionally to genotype I, was recently reported, characterized by an anomalous genotyping pattern and putative recombination; however, the natural history of this unusual strain is unknown. This study analyzed longitudinal sera collected over a 9-year period from a patient infected with this variant to investigate the clinical profile and intrahost viral evolution over time. The patient, who had immigrated to Canada in 1998 from Vietnam, was treated with lamivudine in 2000. Approximately 4-5 years following the withdrawal of lamivudine therapy, a genomic ""shift"" occurred coincident with ALT flares and increasing HBV viral load, resulting in numerous stable nucleotide substitutions within the core coding region, suggesting altered immune control that may provide a selective advantage to the virus. Analysis of quasispecies diversity over time demonstrated further this shift, with two sequence clusters associated with time points either prior to or following relapse observed, including increased diversity among quasispecies prior to relapse. In keeping with the complex nature of genotype I strains, majority population genomes had a mean genetic distance from genotype C of 7.6 +/- 0.1%, although large genomic segments lacked significant homology with any HBV genotype. Further study is needed to understand the evolutionary origin and natural history of infection with this unique HBV variant."
9485,0.003,3.0,"CD4 + lymphocyte counts are routinely ordered during the early phases of antiretroviral therapy and for prophylaxis of opportunistic infections in HIV-positive patients. Flow cytometry is the standard methodology for CD4 counts in Brazilian reference laboratories. However, these laboratories are located in large cities, frequently distant from patients, thus limiting patient access and delaying results. We compared a point-of-care test with flow cytometry determination of CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts in HIV patients. We analysed 107 consecutive samples by both methods. Overall, the point-of-care test performed well, with excellent agreement between it and the standard method. Test results were concordant for patients with CD4(+) T lymphocyte values above and below 200 cells/mm (3). The performance characteristics obtained were sensitivity 94% (95% CI 89.5-98.5%), specificity 93% (95% CI 88.2-97.8%), positive predictive value 86% (95% CI 79.4-92.6%), and negative predictive value 97% (95% CI 94-100%). The high sensitivity and specificity of the point-of-care test methodology suggest its utility as an alternative method for rapid measurement of CD4(+) T lymphocytes in patients with limited access to reference laboratories, enabling prompt therapeutic intervention for patients at risk of progression to AIDS.

2127,0.003,3.0,"The Beckman Coulter LH 750 with VCS technology can determine intrinsic biophysical properties of peripheral leukocytes in their ""near native state."" We investigated the possibility of the LH 750 to detect morphologic changes in lymphocytes/monocytes in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The VCS data from 37 active HBV patients, 140 HBV carriers, and 655 controls were analyzed. We observed significant increases in lymphocyte volume (LV) and the lymphocyte volume SD (LV-SD), and a significant decrease in lymphocyte conductivity (LC) in HBV infection, compared with controls. Similar changes in monocyte volume and conductivity were also observed. A simplified parameter, the Lymph-Index (calculated as [LV LV-SD]/LC]) is proposed. The Lymph-Index was significantly increased in HBV carriers compared with controls (13.86 ± 2.73 versus 11.83 ± 1.36; P < .001). The increase was more pronounced in patients with active HBV infection (18.84 ± 3.88 versus 11.83 ± 1.36; P < .0001). With a cutoff value of 18.2 for the Lymph-Index, a 91.7% sensitivity and a 95.7% specificity were achieved in diagnosing active HBV infection. This overall sensitivity and specificity were superior to those of the individual lymphocyte/monocyte VCS parameters. In conclusion, VCS parameters can reflect the morphologic changes of lymphocytes/monocytes in HBV infection and may be useful clinically to aid in identifying HBV infection in a population with a high HBV prevalence."
9964,0.003,3.0,"We developed a recombinant virus technique to determine the coreceptor usage of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from plasma samples, the source expected to represent the most actively replicating virus population in infected subjects. This method is not subject to selective bias associated with virus isolation in culture, a step required for conventional tropism determination procedures. The addition of a simple subcloning step allowed semiquantitative evaluation of virus populations with a different coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) usage specificity present in each plasma sample. This procedure detected mixtures of CCR5- and CXCR4-exclusive virus populations as well as dualtropic viral variants, in variable proportions. Sequence analysis of dualtropic clones indicated that changes in the V3 loop are necessary for the use of CXCR4 as a coreceptor, but the overall context of the V1-V3 region is important to preserve the capacity to use CCR5. This convenient technique can greatly assist the study of virus evolution and compartmentalization in infected individuals."
676,0.003,3.0,"Constructs were generated in which expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (PR) was placed under control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat, thus requiring the HIV-1 Tat protein for expression of PR. The activity of PR was assessed by cotransfection with a construct producing a Gag substrate. Expression of PR as an intramolecular multimer resulted in a large increase in PR activity in comparison with the level obtained with the expression of PR as a monomer. A cytotoxic effect of PR expression was also exhibited by the constructs expressing PR multimers. CD4+ T-cell lines were generated with a construct producing PR as a linked tetramer and screened for PR activity and inducibility. The replication of HIV-1 in these cell lines was several orders of magnitude reduced in comparison with that in cell lines not expressing PR. Infection in these cell lines could be detected early after infection but disappeared over time. Infection of the PR-expressing cell lines could be increased several orders of magnitude by the addition of a specific inhibitor of PR, U75875 (Upjohn), after infection of the cells, demonstrating that the potent inhibition of HIV-1 replication in these cells was directly due to the expression of PR."
8609,0.003,3.0,"An intracellularly expressed defective human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) protease (PR) monomer could function as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the enzyme that requires dimerization for activity. Based on in silico studies, two mutant PRs harboring hydrophilic mutations, capable of forming favorable inter- and intra-subunit interactions, were selected: PR(RE) containing Asp25Arg and Gly49Glu mutations, and PR(RER) containing an additional Ile50Arg mutation. The mutants were expressed and tested by PR assays, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and cell culture experiments. The mutant PRs showed dose-dependent inhibition of the wild-type PR in a fluorescent microtiter plate PR assay. Furthermore, both mutants were retained by hexahistidine-tagged wild-type HIV-1 PR immobilized on nickel-chelate affinity resin. For the first time, heterodimerization between wild-type and dominant-negative mutant PRs were also demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy. (1)H-(15)N Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence NMR spectra showed that although PR(RE) has a high tendency to aggregate, PR(RER) exists mainly as a folded monomer at 25-35 microM concentration, but in the presence of wild-type PR in a ratio of 1:1, heterodimerization occurs with both mutants. While the recombinant virus containing the PR(RE) sequence showed only very low level of expression, expression of the viral proteins of the virus with the PR(RER) sequence was comparable with that of the wild-type. In cell culture experiments, infectivity of viral particles containing PR(RER) protein was reduced by 82%, at mutant to wild-type infective DNA ratio of 2:1."
3305,0.003,3.0,"To establish a baseline for monitoring resistance to protease inhibitors (PIs) and examining the efficacy of their use among persons in Cameroon infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), we analyzed genetic variability and PI resistance-associated substitutions in PCR-amplified protease (PR) sequences in strains isolated from 110 HIV-1-infected, drug-naïve Cameroonians. Of the 110 strains, 85 were classified into six HIV-1 PR subtypes, A (n = 1), B (n = 1), F (n = 4), G (n = 7), H (n = 1), and J (n = 7), and a circulating recombinant form, CRF02-AG (n = 64). PR genes from the remaining 25 (23%) specimens were unclassifiable, whereas 2% (7 of 301) unclassifiable PR sequences were reported for a global collection. Two major PI resistance-associated mutations, 20M and 24I, were detected in strains from only two specimens, whereas secondary mutations were found in strains from all samples except one strain of subtype B and two strains of CRF02-AG. The secondary mutations showed the typical PI resistance-associated pattern for non-subtype B viruses in both classifiable and unclassifiable PR genes, with 36I being the predominant (99%) mutation, followed by 63P (18%), 20R (15%), 77I (13%), and 10I or 10V (11%). Of these mutations, dual and triple PI resistance-associated substitutions were found in 38% of all the Cameroonian strains. Compared with classifiable PR sequences, unclassifiable sequences had significantly more dual and triple substitutions (64% versus 30%; P = 0.004). Phenotypic and clinical evaluations are needed to estimate whether PI resistance during antiretroviral drug treatment occurs more rapidly in individuals infected with HIV-1 strains harboring multiple PI resistance-associated substitutions. This information may be important for determination of appropriate drug therapies for HIV-1-infected persons in Cameroon, where more than one-third of HIV-1 strains were found to carry dual and triple minor PI resistance-associated mutations."
8111,0.003,3.0,"Simian immunodeficiency virus protease (SIV-PR) was produced in Escherichia coli with a recombinant expression system in which the mature enzyme autoprocessed from a precursor form. Recombinant SIV and HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus, type 1) proteases were purified from bacterial cell lysates by use of sequential steps of ammonium sulfate precipitation and size-exclusion and ion-exchange chromatography. The amino acid composition, amino-terminal sequence, and molecular weight (monomer) of the recombinant SIV-PR were in accord with that of the 99 amino acid polypeptide predicted from the SIVMac-PR nucleotide sequence. The active form of SIV-PR was shown to be dimeric by gel filtration chromatography. Inhibition by pepstatin A, time-dependent inactivation by 1,2-epoxy-3-(4-nitrophenoxy)propane, and pH rate profiles using oligopeptide substrates demonstrated that SIV-PR behaves as an aspartic protease. Recombinant HIV-1 Pr55gag precursor was processed in vitro by SIV-PR and HIV-1 PR with indistinguishable proteolytic patterns upon NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Oligopeptide substrates for HIV-1 PR were found to be suitable substrates for recombinant SIV-PR with the exception of a peptide containing the site identified for p66/p51 cleavage (Phe*Tyr) within HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Several synthetic peptide analogue inhibitors of HIV-1 PR were also potent inhibitors of SIV-PR, indicating that SIV infection in macaques and rhesus monkeys should be useful models for the preclinical evaluation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) therapeutics targeted towards the virally encoded HIV-1 protease."
3278,0.003,3.0,"The complex interplay between the host immune response and HIV has been the subject of intense research over the last 25 years. HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) CD8 T cells have been of particular interest since they were demonstrated to be temporally associated with reduction in virus load shortly following transmission. Here, we briefly review the phenotypic and functional properties of HIV-specific and SIV-specific CD8 T-cell subsets during HIV infection and consider the influence of viral variation with specific responses that are associated with disease progression or control. The development of an effective HIV/AIDS vaccine combined with existing successful prevention and treatment strategies is essential for preventing new infections. In the context of previous clinical HIV/AIDS vaccine trials, we consider the challenges faced by therapeutic and vaccine strategies designed to elicit effective HIV-specific CD8 T cells."
3148,0.003,3.0,"Fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis is a severe form of post-liver transplantation HCV recurrence. Fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis is characterized by its early onset and severe prognosis in HIV-infected patients. We report the case of an HIV-HCV genotype-4 coinfected patient successfully treated with a combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin. After 4 weeks of treatment we observed a resolution of HCV recurrence related symptoms associated with a normalization of liver biochemistry and dramatic decrease of HCV viral load. This case illustrates the efficiency and tolerance of a sofosbuvir-based anti-HCV interferon-free regimen in post-liver HCV recurrence. Because of the absence of drug interactions between sofosbuvir and antiretroviral treatment or calcineurin inhibitors, its administration in HIV-HCV-coinfected liver transplanted patients is very promising.

6857,0.003,3.0,"The magnitude of intestinal parasitic infection in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients requires careful consideration in the developing world where poor nutrition is associated with poor hygiene and several tropical diseases. However, there have been very few studies addressing this issue in Cameroon. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitosis in HIV/AIDS patients in Dschang -Cameroon. Stool and blood specimens from HIV/AIDS patients and control group were screened respectively for intestinal parasites and for HIV antibodies. Intestinal parasites were identified using direct microscopy, formalin-ether concentration and Ziehl Neelsen methods. Out of 396 participants recruited among patients consulting at hospital, 42 (10.6%) were HIV positive, thirty of them treatment naïve. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasites was 14.64%. Out of 42 HIV/AIDS patients, 59.5% (25/42) were infected with intestinal parasites, while only 9.32% (33/354) of the HIV negative patients were infected with intestinal parasites. The parasites detected in our study population included Crystosporidium parvum (2.53%), Entamoeba histolytica (7.52%), Entamoeba coli (4.04%), Giardia lamblia (0.25%), Trichuris trichura (0.25%), Strongyloides stercoralis (0.25%) and Taenia spp. (0.25%). In the HIV infected group, Crystosporidium parvum (19.04%), Entamoeba histolytica (19.04%), Entamoeba coli (21.42%), Giardia lamblia (2.38%), Strongyloides stercoralis (0.25%) and Taenia spp. (0.25%) were found. Crystosporidium parvum was found to be significantly higher in HIV/AIDS patients than in controls (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the HIV status and the quality of water were the major risk factors for intestinal parasitosis. Routine examinations of stool samples for parasites would significantly benefit the HIV patients by contributing in reducing morbidity and improving the efficiency of antiretroviral treatment. Even after the introduction of free anti-retroviral drugs, opportunistic intestinal infections are still a threat. HIV patients should be screened routinely for intestinal parasites and treated for their overall well being."
1594,0.003,3.0,"Most studies of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have been confined to the evaluation of these effector cells in the peripheral blood. What has not been clear is the extent to which CTL activity in the blood actually reflects this effector cell function in the lymph nodes, the major sites of HIV-1 replication. To determine the concordance between CTL activity in lymph nodes and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), CTL specific for simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac) have been characterized in lymph nodes of infected, genetically selected rhesus monkeys by using both Gag peptide-specific functional CTL assays and tetrameric peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule complex staining techniques. In studies of six chronically SIVmac-infected rhesus monkeys, Gag epitope-specific functional lytic activity and specific tetrameric peptide-MHC class I staining were readily demonstrated in lymph node T lymphocytes. Although the numbers of tetramer-binding cells in some animals differed from those documented in their PBL, the numbers of tetramer-binding cells from these two different compartments were not statistically different. Phenotypic characterization of the tetramer-binding CD8(+) lymph node T lymphocytes of the infected monkeys demonstrated a high level of expression of the activation-associated adhesion molecules CD11a and CD49d, the Fas molecule CD95, and MHC class II-DR. These studies documented a low expression of the naive T-cell marker CD45RA and the adhesion molecule CD62L. This phenotypic profile of the tetramer-binding lymph node CD8(+) T cells was similar to that of tetramer-binding CD8(+) T cells from PBL. These observations suggest that characterization of AIDS virus-specific CTL activity by sampling of cells in the peripheral blood should provide a reasonable estimation of CTL in an individual's secondary lymphoid tissue."
1368,0.003,3.0,"HIV-infected individuals have an increased risk of malignancy, especially non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. Recently, several workers have noted a raised prevalence of lung cancer in HIV-positive subjects. We describe the diagnosis and clinical course for four HIV-seropositive patients who presented with lung cancer. All of the patients were young and were heavy smokers. They were all on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), although the adherence varied from poor to excellent. The CD4 cell counts of these patients ranged from 200 to 686 cells/microL and their viral loads ranged from undetectable to 29,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. After initial diagnosis of HIV infection between 5 and 13 years previously, they all presented with advanced lung cancer, with a very short clinical course, and all four died within 2-9 months of diagnosis. A comparison of the incidence of lung cancer in patients with HIV infection at our centre with that in the general population suggests that there is an increased prevalence in the HIV-infected patients. We review the literature and discuss whether lung cancer in HIV infection is coincidental or related to the primary disease."
7129,0.003,3.0,"In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-positive individuals are increasingly presenting with non-AIDS-defining cancers such as lung carcinoma. These neoplasms tend to exhibit aggressive clinical behavior and often present with metastatic disease. We present 2 cases of lung carcinoma that manifested initially with cutaneous metastases. Both patients were men (37 and 43 years old) with known AIDS that presented with multiple skin nodules mainly on the trunk (back and shoulder). These cases demonstrate that cutaneous metastases might represent the first sign of an internal HIV-related malignancy. Recognition of skin metastases is important for prompt diagnosis and initiation of proper therapy. With the growing problem of non-AIDS-defining cancers in the current era of HAART, clinicians should be aware that skin lesions in the HIV-infected individual might represent metastatic disease."

9850,0.003,3.0,"The pathogenic role of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection for glomerulonephritis (GN) is not clear. The frequency of HBsAg has been studied in sera of 732 consecutive patients who have glomerular diseases by using radioimmunoassay. The frequency of HBs antigenemia was 11.9%, which was not different from that in the general population of South Korea. Of the 87 HBsAg seropositive patients with GN, 29 cases with membranoproliferative GN (MPGN) and eighteen with membranous nephropathy (MN) were diagnosed as having HBV-associated nephropathy. Eighty-seven and one-half percent of the adults with MPGN and 80% of the children with MN were HBsAg carries. The morphologic findings and laboratory data in cases with HBV-associated MPGN and MN did not differ significantly from those observed in patients with MPGN and MN without circulating HBsAg. Yet mesangial deposits were more frequently noted in patients with HBV-associated MN when compared to others with idiopathic MN. Glomerular deposits of HBsAg were not detected using indirect immunofluorescence technique. Even though HBsAg was not demonstrable within the glomeruli, HBV infection seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of MPGN in Korean adults and MN in children."
2985,0.003,3.0,"Serological screening assays have greatly reduced, but not eliminated, the risk of transmission of viral infections by transfusion of blood and blood products. In addition, the 1999 regulation of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products requiring all plasma for fractionation to have tested negative for hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA (CPMP/BWP/390/97, 1998) led many blood transfusion services to introduce nucleic acid amplification technology (NAT) to screen blood donations for HCV, and in some services for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). BioMérieux's second-generation system, the NucliSENS easyMAG, was evaluated as a suitable platform for the automated extraction of nucleic acids for use with the existing SNBTS NAT assays. Two nucleic acid extraction protocols were examined, either lysis on the easyMAG (on board) or a 30-min pre-incubation of the sample with lysis buffer at 37 °C (off board). Off board lysis was found to extract nucleic acid more efficiently for both HCV and HIV NAT assays although the improvement was more marked with HIV. The 95% limit of detections (LODs) were 10.11 IU/ml (on board) and 7.21 IU/ml (off board) for HCV and 55.11 IU/ml (on board) and 34.13 (off board) for HIV. Using the more sensitive off board lysis, nucleic acid extraction specificity, robustness and reliability of the easyMAG were examined and over 10,000 Scottish blood donations (in 107 pools of 95 donations) were tested for HCV and HIV in parallel with the existing assay. The results indicate that the easyMAG is a suitable and flexible nucleic acid extraction system, providing high quality nucleic acids and a rapid response alternative to commercial, fully automated, approved blood screening platforms."
8479,0.003,3.0,"The low concentration and complex sample matrix of many clinical and environmental viral samples presents a significant challenge in the development of low cost, point-of-care viral assays. To address this problem, we investigated the use of a microfluidic passive magnetic separator combined with on-chip mixer to both purify and concentrate whole-particle human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions. Virus-containing plasma samples are first mixed to allow specific binding of the viral particles with antibody-conjugated superparamagnetic nanoparticles, and several passive mixer geometries were assessed for their mixing efficiencies. The virus-nanoparticle complexes are then separated from the plasma in a novel magnetic separation chamber, where packed micrometer-sized ferromagnetic particles serve as high magnetic gradient concentrators for an externally applied magnetic field. Thereafter, a viral lysis buffer was flowed through the chip and the released HIV proteins were assayed off-chip. Viral protein extraction efficiencies of 62% and 45% were achieved at 10 and 30 muL/min throughputs, respectively. More importantly, an 80-fold concentration was observed for an initial sample volume of 1 mL and a 44-fold concentration for an initial sample volume of 0.5 mL. The system is broadly applicable to microscale sample preparation of any viral sample and can be used for nucleic acid extraction as well as 40-80-fold enrichment of target viruses."
3365,0.003,3.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif protein plays a critical role in the production of infectious virions. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of small amounts of Vif in virus particles. However, Vif packaging was assumed to be nonspecific, and its functional significance has been questioned. We now report that packaging of Vif is dependent on the packaging of viral genomic RNA in both permissive and restrictive HIV-1 target cells. Mutations in the nucleocapsid zinc finger domains that abrogate packaging of viral genomic RNA abolished packaging of Vif. Additionally, an RNA packaging-defective virus exhibited significantly reduced packaging of Vif. Finally, deletion of a putative RNA-interacting domain in Vif abolished packaging of Vif into virions. Virion-associated Vif was resistant to detergent extraction and copurified with components of the viral nucleoprotein complex and functional reverse transcription complexes. Thus, Vif is specifically packaged into virions as a component of the viral nucleoprotein complex. Our data suggest that the specific association of Vif with the viral nucleoprotein complex might be functionally significant and could be a critical requirement for infectivity of viruses produced from restrictive host cells."
2143,0.003,3.0,The underlying mechanism of HBsAg-negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is notoriously difficult to elucidate because of the extremely low DNA levels which define the condition. We used a highly efficient amplification method to overcome this obstacle and achieved our aim which was to identify specific mutations or sequence variations associated with this entity.
1441,0.003,3.0,"Telaprevir and boceprevir, the two first hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitors (PIs), considerably increase rates of sustained virologic response in association with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in chronic HCV genotype 1 infections. The 30 first patients treated by telaprevir or boceprevir including anti-HCV therapies since 2011 in Marseille University hospitals, France, were monitored. HCV loads and plasmatic concentrations of telaprevir and boceprevir were determined on sequential blood samples. HCV NS3 protease gene population sequencing was performed at baseline of treatment and in case of treatment failure. Fifteen patients (including 7 co-infected with HIV) received telaprevir and the other 15 patients (including 4 co-infected with HIV) received boceprevir. At baseline, HCV NS3 protease from six patients harbored amino acid substitutions associated with PI-resistance. Treatment failure occurred at week 12 for 7 patients. Amino acid substitutions associated with PI-resistance were observed in six of these cases. HCV NS3 R155K and T54A/S mutants, all of genotype 1a, were found from four patients. Median (interquartile range) plasma concentrations were 3,092 ng/ml (2,320-3,525) for telaprevir and 486 ng/ml (265-619) for boceprevir. For HIV-HCV co-infected patients, median concentrations were 3,162 ng/ml (2,270-4,232) for telaprevir and 374 ng/ml (229-519) for boceprevir. Plasma drug concentration monitoring revealed undetectable concentrations for two patients at week 4, and probable non-adherence to therapy for another patient. These findings indicate that routine HCV NS3 protease sequencing and plasma PI concentration monitoring might be helpful to characterize cases of therapy failure, at a cost dramatically low compared to that of anti-HCV therapy."
5484,0.003,3.0,"Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a known complication during and after anti-cancer therapy. This condition can affect two patient populations: it is most commonly seen in patients who are seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), but it is also being increasingly reported among patients who are HBsAg-negative but who have prior infection, as evident by seropositive status for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), irrespective of their anti-HBs (antibody to HBsAg) status. The clinical course can vary from asymptomatic hepatitis to fulminant hepatic failure that can be potentially fatal. With the increasing use of biological agents in addition to potent cytotoxic chemotherapy in the armamentarium of anti-cancer treatments, reactivation of hepatitis B has become a common clinical situation that is faced by both oncologists and hepatologists especially in HBV endemic areas. In this review, we discuss the clinical course of reactivation in the two HBV-infected sub-populations, and the role of anti-virals in the prevention and management of HBV reactivation in association with cytotoxic chemotherapy and biological therapies."
9755,0.003,3.0,"Four hundred and fifty-nine Ethiopian volunteer blood donors were prospectively studied for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Delta agent infections. The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was 11%, anti-HBs and only anti-HBc 66% and 2%, respectively. Thus, the total HBV infection rate was 79%. There was a single donor with antibody against Delta antigen. The rarity of HBeAg among HBsAg carriers, the lack of occurrence of factors favouring transmission and risk calculations using the available data indicate that post-transfusion hepatitis due to HBV is unlikely to be common in this highly endemic country with very limited financial resources allocated for health services. Thus, we question the validity of indiscriminate screening of all donated blood and we suggest that health policies should emphasize the need for preventive measures."
8751,0.003,3.0,Unexpected cases of severe liver disease in HIV-infected patients have been reported and an association with didanosine (ddI) has been suggested. Transient elastography (TE) might detect patients harbouring such a condition. Our objective was to search for the presence of abnormal liver stiffness (LS) in a cohort of HIV-infected patients without HBV or HCV coinfection and to assess the related factors.
9306,0.003,3.0,"The treatment costs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients continue to rise as patients survive longer because of advances in antiretroviral therapy and effective chemoprophylaxis. Medication costs per patient increase in proportion to progressive immunodeficiency. We retrospectively studied medication costs for 196 HIV-infected patients with stratification by CD4-lymphocyte count. Medication costs per patient-month were correlated with CD4-lymphocyte count (linear regression, r = -.53, P < 0.01), with higher costs associated with lower CD4 counts. The medication cost for patients with CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm3 averaged $1043 per month. Medication costs per patient increase with the development of each new opportunistic infection or other AIDS-associated condition. Costs can be expected to increase as new therapeutic agents are introduced, as treatment is initiated at earlier stages of HIV infection, and as more patients survive to the point of severe CD4-lymphocyte depletion."
4172,0.003,3.0,"Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is believed to be associated with reduced hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity and risk factors such as alcohol abuse and medication with oral contraceptives and certain other drugs. Recently it has been suggested that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may also be associated with PCT. We have therefore reviewed the prevalence of HCV infection in a series of patients with PCT in the Lothian region of Scotland. We identified 12 patients with PCT, all of whom had abnormal liver function tests. Liver histology revealed chronic active hepatitis in six patients, micronodular cirrhosis in four patients, hepatocellular carcinoma in one patient and normal findings in one HIV positive patient. Out of 12 patients tested, 11 were positive for anti-HCV antibodies by second generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA 2), and by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA 2); positive serology was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In a second group of 14 patients with chronic HCV infection matched for age and sex with the PCT patients, all had normal urinary uroporphyrin excretion. We have thus confirmed in Scotland early reports from Spain and Italy that PCT is strongly associated with HCV infection. This could explain the development of inflammatory changes in the liver and progression of liver disease in patients with PCT. Porphyrin metabolism, however, appears normal in patients with chronic HCV infection without PCT."
5793,0.003,3.0,"A cross-sectional analysis was carried out to describe adverse reactions to antiretroviral therapy (ART) reported by HIV-infected patients initiating treatment at two public health AIDS referral centers in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2001-2003 and to verify their association with selected variables. Adverse reactions were obtained through interview at the first follow-up visit (first month) after the antiretroviral prescription. Socio-demographic and behavioral variables related to ART were obtained from baseline and follow-up interviews and clinical variables from medical charts. Patients with four or more reactions were compared to those with less than four. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval were estimated using logistic regression model for both univariate and multivariate analyses. At least one adverse reaction was reported by 92.2% of the participants while 56.2% reported four or more different reactions. Antiretroviral regimens including indinavir/ritonavir, irregular use of antiretrovirals and switch in regimens were independently associated with four or more adverse reactions (OR=7.92, 5.73 and 2.03, respectively). The initial period of ARV treatment is crucial and patients' perception of adverse reactions should be carefully taken into account. Strategies for monitoring and management of adverse reactions including the choice of regimens and the prevention of irregular ART should be developed in AIDS/HIV referral centers in Brazil to promote better adherence to antiretroviral therapy."
7143,0.003,3.0,"A new class of membrane-active ether lipid (EL) analogs of platelet-activating factor were studied for in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity. Human T-cell (CEM-ss) monolayers or suspension cultures were used to determine effects of structural modifications of Type A phosphorus-containing and Type B nonphosphorus EL analogs on (a) the inhibitory concentration50 (IC50) for HIV-1 syncytial plaque formation and cell growth, and, (b) virus budding at the cell plasma membrane. Results indicate that representative Type A and Type B EL inhibit HIV-1 but not herpes simplex virus type 2 plaque formation when added before or up to 2 days after viral infection. Anti-HIV-1 activity does not involve direct inactivation of virus infectivity. Type A EL (IC50 range = 0.2-1.4 microM) with alkyoxy, alkylthio, or alkyamido substitution at glycerol position 1 and ethoxy or methoxy substitution at position 2, and Type B compounds (IC50 range = 0.33-0.63 microM) with an inverse choline or nitrogen heterocyclic substitution at position 3 have selective activity against HIV-1-infected T-cells. EL treatment of HIV-1-infected cells is associated with subsequent release of reverse transcriptase activity, but infectious virus production is inhibited with time after infection. Electron microscopic examination of HIV-1-infected and EL-treated cells revealed absence of detectable budding virus at the plasma membrane but presence of intracytoplasmic vacuolar virus particles. In summary, these data suggest that EL analogs are a novel class of agents that induce defective intracytoplasmic vacuolar HIV-1 formation in T-cells. Being membrane interactive, EL are ideally suited for combination chemotherapy with DNA-interactive anti-HIV nucleoside analogs."
9021,0.003,3.0,"The production of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) has been reported as being significantly associated with the gene polymorphism in the leader sequence at positions +29. The current study aimed to evaluate the associations between the polymorphism and the clinical characteristics of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). A total of 422 (252 men; mean age: 49.7 +/- 11.2 years) Taiwanese CHC patients with liver biopsies were enrolled. The TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism at position +29 (T or C), hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA genotypes, and serum HCV RNA levels of these patients were determined. Of the 422 patients, the frequency of the T allele was 45.4%. Based on univariate analyses, a significantly lesser proportion of patients with allele T had high viral loads than those who were without allele T (P = 0.026). The lesser HCV RNA levels and HCV genotype 1b infection were significantly associated with the inheritance of the T allele in female patients based on univariate (P = 0.012 and 0.007, respectively) and multivariate regression (odds ratio/95% confidence interval: 0.434/0.219-0.859 and 0.468/0.237-0.927, respectively) analyses. In male patients with or without inheritance of the T allele, the clinical characteristics were similar. In conclusion, the association between TGF-beta1 polymorphism and virologic characteristics of chronic HCV infection implicated a significant role of host genetic factors on the clinical features of CHC. Female patients who carry T allele at position +29 were predisposed to be associated with HCV genotype non-1b infection and lesser HCV viral load, which revealed the gender effect."
6451,0.003,3.0,"To investigate the dynamics of the K103N mutation following the withdrawal of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), we selected the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected patients with the mutation at the time or after the failure of an NNRTI-containing regimen from an observational database. Of 62 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 39 continued antiretroviral treatment without NNRTIs (group A), whereas 23 discontinued all antiretrovirals after NNRTI failure (group B). A total of 149 tests were analysed, with a median (IQR) of two (2-3) tests/patient. The overgrowth of wild-type virus at position 103 was observed in 14 subjects in group A (36%) and nine in group B (39%). No significant trend was found in relation to the disappearance of K103N variants in either group, but patients tested while receiving antiretrovirals had a significantly higher probability of retaining the K103N mutation over 24 months than those tested during treatment interruption (P = 0.007). In conclusion, following NNRTI discontinuation, HIV variants carrying the K103N mutation are not overgrown for long by wild-type quasispecies at this position in the majority of patients, although treatment interruption favours their disappearance. This suggests that the K103N mutation per se has little impact on viral fitness in vivo."
5113,0.003,3.0,"This study explores whether MHC genes affect manifestations of opportunistic infections in HIV patients not treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and immunopathologic responses to pre-existing infections in patients who achieved immune reconstitution following HAART (i.e., ""immune restoration diseases"" or IRD). HLA-B27 and B17 were relatively rare in all HIV patients, but no HLA-B alleles significantly affected cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease in patients who had not received HAART. However coexpression of alleles previously defined as the 44.1 ancestral haplotype (HLA-A2, -B44, and -DR4) was more common in the MAC and CMV patients. After HAART, HLA-B44 and (HLA-A2, -B44, -DR4) were found in 66% and 33%, respectively, of patients who experienced an IRD manifested as CMV retinitis and/or encephalomyelitis. This was confirmed by examination of microsatellite alleles, where the C1_2_5 locus in the class I region was most concordant with the 44.1 haplotype in the patients. HLA-B44 was not associated with IRD initiated by Mycobacterium sp, cutaneous VZV or HSV, or HCV infections, suggesting distinct pathologic mechanisms are responsible. CMV retinitis/encephalomyelitis IRD patients had marginally lower pretreatment CD4 T-cell counts, but indices of immune reconstitution were similar in all groups and independent of HLA-B44."

5090,0.003,3.0,"We carried out a 1-year trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of lamivudine, an oral nucleoside analogue, in a small group of children with vertically acquired chronic hepatitis B. Patients were assessed for serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter, and for hepatitis B s antigen, hepatitis B e antigen and their antibodies every 12 weeks. Analysis of HBV mutation was undertaken at entry and on the occasion of the last positive control of HBV DNA. Lamivudine suppressed serum HBV DNA to undetectable levels in all treated patients within 24 weeks. Serum ALT levels returned to normal values within 36 weeks. Therapy was well tolerated, and although nausea and vomiting were reported in one child, it was not necessary to stop treatment. A new observation was that, contrary to previous data, seroconversion appeared to occur earlier in children with lower ALT levels at baseline."
3257,0.003,3.0,"Numerous host and viral factors likely participate in the onset and progression of HIV-1-associated dementia (HIVD). Previous studies have suggested that viral gene expression in resident central nervous system (CNS) cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage play a central role in the production of neurotoxic viral proteins and infectious virus, deregulation of cellular gene expression, and/or dysfunction of glial and neuronal cell populations. HIV-1 replication is regulated, in part, by interactions between cellular transcription factors and the viral trans-activators, Tat and viral protein R (Vpr), with cis-acting promoter elements within the LTR. We have previously demonstrated that Vpr binds with high affinity to selected sequence configurations within CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site I and downstream sequences immediately adjacent to this site. Studies reported herein establish a correlation between the diagnosis of HIVD and the increased prevalence of HIV-1 LTRs containing a C/EBP binding site I that exhibits high affinity for Vpr. To this end, the interaction of Vpr with C/EBP site I variants in 47 LTRs from three nondemented patients and 96 LTRs from seven demented patients was examined. Competition electrophoretic mobility shift (EMS) analyses were utilized to examine Vpr binding to oligonucleotide probes containing C/EBP site I variants. We demonstrated that 89% of LTRs derived from patients exhibiting clinical dementia contained C/EBP site I configurations that displayed a high relative affinity for Vpr, while only 11% of LTRs contained C/EBP site I configurations that exhibited a low relative affinity Vpr binding phenotype. In contrast, examination of LTRs derived from patients lacking clinically evident dementia revealed that only 53% of brain-derived LTRs contained C/EBP site I configurations that displayed a high relative affinity for Vpr, while 47% of LTRs contained C/EBP site I configurations that exhibited a low relative affinity Vpr binding phenotype. We propose that sequence-specific interactions between cis-acting elements in the LTR, members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors, and the virion-associated trans-activator protein Vpr play important roles in the pathogenesis of HIVD."

4554,0.003,3.0,"Analysis of the preS1 gene of hepatitis B virus was used to define two nosocomial outbreaks of HBV infection. In an outbreak in an oncology unit we had previously shown by single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of a 189 bp fragment of the preS1 gene, that 52 children were infected with HBV strains that displayed only 5 different SSCP profiles. Sequencing of a 383 bp fragment encompassing the entire preS1 gene, revealed that isolates with same SSCP profile were identical in sequence across the entire preS1 gene, confirming that those patients with the same SSCP pattern had epidemiologically linked infections. A second outbreak involved 8 liver transplant patients from two different hospitals, 5 of whom were from the same hospital at which the oncology outbreak had occurred. Two of these 5 patients had HBV strains that were identical to strains from the oncology unit and nosocomial transmission probably accounted for the infections in these two, while diversity of both SSCP profiles and sequence data of remaining 6 patients supported the conclusion that they had not been infected from a common source. The donor liver is believed to be the most likely source of infection in these patients. HBV isolates from patients infected in the community were used as a standard for the general degree of preS1 sequence variation of local HBV strains. Phylogenetic analysis and comparison with reference HBV clones revealed that of 27 local HBV strains, genotypes A and D occurred most frequently and were identified in 14 and 12 patients respectively, while genotype C was detected in one patient."
8053,0.003,3.0,"We conducted a case-control study to investigate the role of three common single nucleotide polymorphisms of IL-10 (-592G/A, -819T/C, and -1082A/C) in the development of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study included 173 HBV-related HCC patients and 182 healthy controls. A polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was applied to assess the sequence variants of interest. Compared with control subjects, HCC patients were more likely to be older (t = 1.94, P = 0.03), have a family history of cancer (chi square = 17.86, P < 0.001), and exhibit higher alanine transaminase (t = 13.32, P < 0.001) and aspartate transaminase (t = 12.63, P < 0.001) levels. Using unconditional logistic regression analyses, we found that the GG genotype of -592G/A was associated with increased risk of HCC [odds ratio (OR) = 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.12-4.38], compared to the AA genotype. Under a dominant model, the AG+GG genotype correlated with HBV-related HCC susceptibility compared to the AA genotype, with an OR (95%CI) of 1.56 (1.02-2.48). Moreover, a recessive model showed the GG genotype to be associated with elevated risk of HCC compared to the AA+AG genotype (OR = 1.85, 95%CI = 1.01-3.47). However, no significant association between the -819T/C and -1082A/C variants and development of HBV-related HCC was observed under codominant, dominant, and recessive models. We conclude that the IL-10 -592G/A polymorphism does play a role in susceptibility to HBV-related HCC under codominant, dominant, and recessive models. "
5180,0.003,3.0,Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HBV) infections accounts for substantial proportions of the world wide liver disease. The two hepatotropic virus share common modes of transmission and their co-infection are common.

This study was aimed to assess the prevalence of HBV and HCV among patients attending serology laboratory of Gondar University Teaching Hospital.
590,0.003,3.0,"Pentoxifylline (Trental), used routinely for the treatment of intermittent claudication, has been shown previously to decrease the levels of tumor necrosis factors-alpha (TNF-alpha) RNA in cancer patients and to lead to a general improvement of well being. Increased TNF-alpha levels have been observed not only in cancer patients but also in cachectic patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and TNF-alpha is known to increase the expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) via activating its long terminal repeat (LTR). Moreover, TNF-alpha decreases the therapeutic efficacy of zidovudine (AZT). Here we show a significant decrease in HIV-1 replication by pentoxifylline in infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The reduction was proportional to the downregulation of expression of a reporter gene, the bacterial gene for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, linked to the HIV-1 LTR in human monocytoid cells. We conclude that patients with AIDS may benefit from pentoxifylline treatment because of its blockage of TNF-alpha-mediated HIV-1 upregulation, from increased efficacy of AZT, and also from improvement in TNF-alpha-induced cachexia."
3152,0.003,3.0,"Infection of T cell lines by the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is associated with downregulation of the CD4 receptor and resistance to further HIV-1 infection, the phenomenon of viral interference. The ACH2 cell line, a model for chronic HIV-1 infection, possesses a single integrated copy of the HIV-1 strain LAI, is essentially CD4 negative, and can be induced to make virus by a variety of stimuli. We utilized the known sequence differences between HIVLAI and HIVRF to devise a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategy that permits reliable and quantitative discrimination between the two strains. We demonstrate that ACH2 cells can be superinfected by HIVRF at a frequency of 60-300 HIVRF genomes/10(4) ACH2 cells and that the frequency of superinfection appears to increase with time. Reverse transcription of ACH2 mRNA from days 13, 27, and 38 postinfection allowed a similar PCR strategy (RT-PCR) to be used to analyze full-length HIVRF- and HIVLAI-specific transcripts. These data suggested that superinfection of ACH2 with HIVRF results in an increase in expression of both HIVRF and HIVLAI mRNA. From day 13 to day 38 postinfection there was an increase in the relative expression of HIVRF compared with HIVLAI. By day 38, when only 1.1% of HIV DNA sequences were HIVRF derived, roughly 80% of the HIV-specific full-length mRNA was HIVRF in origin, with a concomitant decrease in HIVLAI transcription."
7094,0.003,3.0,"Our study assessed the influence of HIV-related stigma on treatment adherence among people living with HIV in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and whether social support had a moderating effect on this relationship. We recruited 128 patients living with HIV from Sansai Hospital, a community hospital in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and collected data through structured interviews. All forms of HIV-related stigma considered in this study (personalized experience, disclosure, negative self-image, and public attitudes) were negatively correlated with adherence to anti-retroviral regimens. Multiple linear regression indicated that total HIV-related stigma was more predictive of treatment adherence than any individual stigma type, after adjusting for socio-demographic and health characteristics. Tests of interaction showed that social support did not appear to moderate the association between HIV stigma and treatment adherence. Our findings suggest that community and government efforts to improve public perceptions about people living with HIV might promote treatment adherence behaviors among HIV-positive patients. "
1153,0.003,3.0,"Current guidelines recommend commencing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected patients when CD4 T-cell counts reach 350 cells/microL. However, late-presenting HIV-infected patients with CD4 T-cell counts<50 cells/microL are still common. The ability of long-term HAART to normalize immune dysregulation in severely immunodeficient HIV-infected patients remains unclear. Here we address indices of immune dysregulation in previously severely immunocompromised HIV-infected patients treated with long-term HAART who had achieved increased CD4 T-cell counts and complete suppression of HIV viraemia."
132,0.003,3.0,"Over the past 6 to 7 years an increasing incidence of acute hepatitis C virus (AHCV) has been fuelled by two different changing epidemics: (1) a new resurgence of AHCV amongst intravenous drug users (IVDU); and (2) presumed sexually transmitted AHCV amongst predominantly HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Increasing incidence amongst IVDUs is likely to be a consequence of changing injecting behaviour, possibly related to changes in perception of HIV as well as HCV risk and consequences. Increasing incidence amongst MSM is likely to be a consequence of changing sexual practices, for example number of sexual partners and type of sexual behaviour, as well as increasing availability of recreational drugs associated with sexual risk-taking, and wider availability of casual sexual partners via the internet or sex-on-premises venues. It remains unclear whether the current outbreaks in MSM, predominantly seen in HIV-positive individuals, reflect a predisposition to AHCV secondary to HIV status per se, or whether this reflects differences in behaviour amongst HIV-positive versus HIV-negative MSM, or potentially increased screening (either routine or secondary to abnormal liver function tests) in HIV-positive MSM. The majority of individuals with AHCV are asymptomatic and therefore routine screening of individuals in at-risk groups with abnormal liver function tests should be considered. Previous historical studies suggest that individuals with concomitant HIV infection are far less likely than those without to spontaneously clear HCV. It is currently recommended that such individuals acutely infected with HCV should undergo monitoring of HCV viral load levels to determine whether spontaneous clearance is likely or whether the opportunity for early treatment should be considered."
8317,0.003,3.0,"Humoral response to vaccination has been found to be inadequate in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We retrospectively assessed antibody responses to three routinely recommended vaccines, against hepatitis B, hepatitis A and S. pneumoniae, in HIV-infected individuals. Data regarding age at HIV diagnosis, years of infection, sex, nationality, HIV mode of transmission, CD4 cell count, nadir CD4 count, plasma viral load, HIV stage, insurance status, educational level and treatment with Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) were collected. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed in order to detect factors associated with response to vaccination. 437 patients were assessed for hepatitis B, 627 patients for hepatitis A and 66 patients for S. pneumoniae serologic vaccine responsiveness. Regarding hepatitis B and hepatitis A, education level and insurance status were the only predictors of response. As for S. pneumoniae vaccination HAART and control of viremia were correlated with better response to vaccination."
5026,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is still the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis world wide. Recently, however, there has been quite dramatic improvement in the understanding of HBV associated liver disease and its treatment. It has become clear that high viral replication is a major risk factor for the development of both cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Early studies have shown lamivudine lowers the risk of HBV associated complications. There are currently three nucleos(t)ides licensed, in addition to interferon, and there are more drugs coming to the market soon. Interferon or its pegylated counterpart are still the only options for treatment with defined end points, while nucleos(t)ides therapy is used mostly for long term treatment. Combination therapies have not been shown to be superior to monotherapy in naive patients, however, the outcome depends on how the end point is defined. Interferon plus lamivudine achieves a higher viral suppression than either treatment alone, even though Hbe-seroconversion was not different after a one year treatment. HBV-genotypes emerge as relevant factors, with genotypes ""A"" and ""B"" responding relatively well to interferon, achieving up to 20% HBsAg clearance in the case of genotype ""A"". In addition to having a defined treatment duration, interferon has the advantage of lacking resistance selection, which is a major drawback for lamivudine and the other nucleos(t)ides. The emergence of resistance against adefovir and entecavir is somewhat slower in naive compared to lamivudine resistant patients. Adefovir has a low resistance profile with 3%, 9%, 18%, and 28% after 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, while entecavir has rarely produced resistance in naive patients for up to 3 years."
2848,0.003,3.0,"A novel technology combining replication- and integration-defective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vectors with genetically modified dendritic cells was developed in order to induce T-cell immunity. We introduced the vector into dendritic cells as a plasmid DNA using polyethylenimine as the gene delivery system, thereby circumventing the problem of obtaining viral vector expression in the absence of integration. Genetically modified dendritic cells (GMDC) presented viral epitopes efficiently, secreted interleukin 12, and primed both CD4(+) and CD8(+) HIV-specific T cells capable of producing gamma interferon and exerting potent HIV-1-specific cytotoxicity in vitro. In nonhuman primates, subcutaneously injected GMDC migrated into the draining lymph node at an unprecedentedly high rate and expressed the plasmid DNA. The animals presented a vigorous HIV-specific effector cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte (CTL) response as early as 3 weeks after a single immunization, which later developed into a memory CTL response. Interestingly, antibodies did not accompany these CTL responses, indicating that GMDC can induce a pure Th1 type of immune response. Successful induction of a broad and long-lasting HIV-specific cellular immunity is expected to control virus replication in infected individuals."
2687,0.003,3.0,"Both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and viral hepatitis constitute major disease burden globally. As with other parts of the world, the HIV epidemic in Asia impacts mainly on men who have sex with men, one of the at-risk populations for sexually transmitted viral hepatitis. With the increasing availability of effective antiretroviral therapy, HIV-related mortality of people living with HIV has markedly reduced. Liver disease has become an important cause of mortality and morbidity in the HIV-infected population. With the improvement of socioeconomic conditions and availability of healthcare in Asian countries in recent years, the epidemiology of sexually transmitted viral hepatitis among HIV-positive men who have sex with men has also evolved. This review updates the epidemiology of different types of sexually transmitted viral hepatitis in this defined population in Asia. "

Many orphans in UNM report symptoms of psychological trauma. The primary study objective was to evaluate a multidisciplinary program integrating HIV prevention with an existing package of mental health services. We randomly selected 120 orphans between ages 15-25 years served by UNM and evaluated sexually-transmitted infections, HIV risk-taking behaviors and knowledge, and mental health at baseline, 5, 9, and 12 months. Increased trauma symptoms at baseline were associated with poorer coping skills and social functioning, and increased psychological distress and HIV risk-taking behavior. Following the 12-month intervention, trauma symptoms declined significantly, with those accessing counseling services showing greatest improvement. Orphans with the highest trauma scores benefited most from the intervention. In this at-risk population, addressing mental health issues in the context of HIV prevention is critical."

An empowerment focused intervention is a procedure by which HIV infected people obtain combined possession of programs to attain mainly cost-effective HIV outcomes and deal with social and structural difficulties related to their universal health access and human rights. Empowerment is a key approach for addressing HIV related issues that focuses on addressing a broader context. However, the practices of empowerment based approaches are sparse. We assessed the effect of an intervention to empower HIV infected people receiving ART."

8326,0.003,3.0,"Prevalence and risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were studied in 2,587 pregnant women from three rural Egyptian villages in the Nile Delta being admitted to a prospective cohort study of maternal-infant transmission; 408 (15.8%) had antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) and 279 (10.8%) also had HCV-RNA. Fewer than 1% gave a history of jaundice or liver disease. Risk factors for anti-HCV included increasing age, low socioeconomic status and a history of blood transfusion or injection therapy for schistosomiasis. Sub-analyses after stratification of subjects by village revealed risks associated with specific venues for medical care, having a previous delivery attended by a traditional birth assistant (TBA), receiving medical care in a temporary clinic located in a mosque, overnight admission to a private doctor's clinic, and circumcision by a TBA or a 'health barber'. Our results suggest HCV causes very little detected illness in young adult Egyptian women and some sources of HCV transmission in rural Egypt in the past were associated with the provision of medical care and varied by location. Prevention should be focused on providing appropriate resources and health education should be given to formal and informal health care providers and should be sufficiently broad to adjust for local variations in exposures."

5064,0.003,3.0,"The clinical symptoms of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection include severe liver damage, which is associated with the elimination of the HBV‑infected cells by the immune system. It has been suggested that suppression of HBV replication is not sufficient for patients with hepatitis B and the damaged liver function requires restoration. In the present study, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were combined with short hairpin (sh)RNA to treat liver injury and suppress HBV replication in a mouse model. Lx‑shRNA157‑1694 (an shRNA expression plasmid containing two shRNA expression cassettes) and mouse immortal (mi)MSCs stably expressing shRNA (miMSC‑shRNA) were constructed and their suppressive effects on HBV expression were investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR), ELISA and immunofluorescence. Hepatogenic differentiation of miMSC‑shRNA was induced in vitro and confirmed by morphology, reverse transcription‑semi‑quantitative and ‑quantitative PCR, urea production and Periodic acid‑Schiff staining analyses. miMSCs and the shRNA expression plasmid alone or combined with miMSCs stably expressing shRNA were injected into mice. The former therapeutic regimen successfully suppressed HBV expression in sera and liver tissue, whereas the latter only suppressed HBV expression in liver tissue. Analyses of serum alanine aminotransferase levels, aspartate aminotransferase levels, liver weight/body weight ratio percentage and sirius red staining demonstrated marked amelioration of liver injury in mice treated with both therapeutic regimens. The results of the present study suggest that miMSCs combined with shRNA treatment may alleviate liver injury and suppress HBV expression, thus providing a novel potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of liver injury induced by HBV infection."
5939,0.003,3.0,"Although highly active antiretroviral therapy has enabled constant progress in reducing HIV-1 replication, in some patients who are ""aviremic"" during treatment, the problem of insufficient immune restoration remains, and this exposes them to the risk of immune deficiency-associated pathologies. Various mechanisms may combine and account for this impaired immunologic response to treatment. A first possible mechanism is immune activation, which may be because of residual HIV production, microbial translocation, co-infections, immunosenescence, or lymphopenia per se. A second mechanism is ongoing HIV replication. Finally, deficient thymus output, sex, and genetic polymorphism influencing apoptosis may impair immune reconstitution. In this review we will discuss the tools at our disposal to identify the various mechanisms at work in a given patient and the specific therapeutic strategies we could propose based on this etiologic diagnosis."

Referral rate for HIV testing was 4.4% (30/684) in 2007, 15.4% (116/751) in 2008, and 30.1% (283/940) in 2009, with a significant upward trend over the period of time (P = .009). The main barriers perceived by health providers were poor knowledge about TB/HIV, lack of communication skills, absence of any target plan for TB patient referral for HIV testing, and fear associated with informing positive test results to the TB patients and the associated stigma. Strategies to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS/TB among TB patients and their providers may improve the current state of low referral and its barriers in Cambodia. "
8906,0.003,3.0,"It has been estimated that, to date, about 48% of all HIV-infected people in the world carry HIV-1 subtype C virus. Therefore, it is of great importance to gain better knowledge about the genetic and biological characteristics of this virus subtype. In the present study, the biological properties of HIV-1 isolates obtained from nine Ethiopian patients with AIDS were studied. DNA sequencing of the V3 loop of gp120 classified the isolates as subtype C. In primary isolation cultures, virus infection was accompanied by syncytium formation and cell lysis. Interestingly, when examining the growth in primary monocyte-macrophage cultures, initial low-level virus replication was followed by a nonproductive state, from which virus could be rescued by cocultivation with Jurkat(tat) cells. Furthermore, none of the isolates replicated in T cell lines (CEM, MT-2, HuT-78, and H9) or in the promonocytic cell line U937 clone 2. All isolates could use CCR5 as coreceptor, whereas no isolates could use CCR2b, CCR3, CCR5, CXCR4, Bonzo/STRL33, or BOB/GPR15. The genotype of the V3 region correlated with the MT-2 negative/non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) phenotype. Comparative studies revealed that the scarcity of CXCR4 usage as well as other phenotypic characteristics of subtype C isolates distinguish this subtype. On the basis of these data, we suggest that in addition, factors other than viral phenotype may govern the pathogenic potential of subtype C isolates."

We tested the effects of HLA-DP SNPs for all major HBV outcomes in Han Chinese (n = 1742): HBV resistance, clearance, chronic infection, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HLA - DPA1 rs3077 T was strongly associated with decreased risk of chronic HBV infection (odds ratio, .62; P = .001), consistent with the previous report. We showed for the first time to our knowledge that it is a predictor for HBV clearance (odds ratio, 2.41; P < .001). However, rs3077 was not associated with the development of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma."
8416,0.003,3.0,Sera from 65 patients with primary liver carcinoma (PLC) and 69 sex- and age-matched controls were examined for Hepatitis B virus markers. Forty two of the patients (65%) and 25 controls (36%) were HBsAg positive. Anti-HBc was demonstrated in over 80% and in 84% of the study groups respectively. Over 70% of hepatitis B infection was anicteric and traditional surgical intervention correlated with prevalence of PLC. The data provide support for the etiological role of HBV in Nigerian patients with PLC; this is the first report that the incidence of PLC is highest in the northern Savannah region of Nigeria.

Longitudinal data were collected on 202 HIV-infected women without AIDS who were receiving care at Kings County Hospital or SUNY Health Sciences Center, Brooklyn, New York. Internal consistency results showed acceptable reliability for the four multi-item MOS scales (role function, physical function, general health perceptions and mental health). Symptomatic patients and patients with lower Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ratings reported lower HRQOL than those who were asymptomatic or who had higher KPS scores. Patients who were older, unemployed or who had a history of injection drug use (IDU) also reported lower HRQOL than those who were younger, employed or who had no drug use history. Adjusted mean scores on the MOS role and physical functioning scales proved sensitive to differences in clinical status over time. The MOS SF-20 is a reliable and valid instrument of HRQOL for women with HIV infection. Its sensitivity to differences in clinical status over time suggest that it may be useful as an HRQOL indicator for HIV/AIDS clinical trials."
4542,0.003,3.0,"One hundred sequences of HIV-1 protease with the two flanking cleavage sites from 10 antiretroviral drug-treated Thai patients were examined for residue variability and for mutations at positions associated with the resistance to protease inhibitors. Seven patients were infected with CRF01_AE, two with subtype B, and one with a strain that did not belong to any of the currently identified subtypes or recombinant forms. A total of 46 out of the 99 positions (46%) in HIV-1 protease showed at least one amino acid change as compared with the HXB2 subtype B protease. Interestingly, 35% of these mutations were at positions associated with resistance to the PIs. The observation indicated that the viral protease is flexible in tolerating some degree of amino acid substitutions even in the critical regions under the selective pressure driven by antiretroviral drugs. The PR/RT cleavage site revealed conservation of the HXB2 sequence. Nevertheless, the p6*/PR cleavage site displayed variability, notably in the p6* region."
325,0.003,3.0,"The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with tuberculosis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons living in Switzerland, a country with low prevalence of tuberculous infection. We performed a nested case-control study and logistic regression. Cases (n = 239) were patients participating in the Swiss-HIV Cohort study (n = 7,103), diagnosed with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis. The rest of the cohort population was used as control. Patients from industrialized countries had a risk of tuberculosis similar to those from Switzerland (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.7-1.5); whereas the risk among patients from Eastern Europe (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.9-3.7), Brazil (OR 10.6; 95% CI 9.6-11.5), and Africa (OR 3.0; 95% CI 2.4-3.6) was markedly higher. Immune suppression, as indicated by low CD4 + cell count, was an independent risk factor for tuberculosis (OR 7.8; 95% CI 7.3-8.3 for patients with CD4 + < 50 cells.mm-3 compared to those with CD4 + > 500 cells.mm-3). Age, sex and HIV-transmission category did not appear to increase the risk of tuberculosis after adjustment for other patient characteristics. In conclusion, in countries of low prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, to originate from a country with high prevalence of tuberculosis infection and to have advanced immunodeficiency are significant risk factors for tuberculosis. They may be used to complement the tuberculin skin test in targeting patients for preventive chemotherapy."
7302,0.003,3.0,"The prevalence and associated factors of erectile dysfunction (ED) in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected men remain controversial. The authors evaluated ED, clinical, and emotional variables in a group of 501 HIV-infected men in a cross-sectional 4-month observational study. ED was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function-5 and emotional status using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire. Median age (interquartile range) was 42 (35, 48) years. Time since HIV diagnosis was 6.3 (2.6, 17.1) years, 92% were taking antiretroviral treatment and 81.8% had an HIV-RNA viral load <50 copies. The prevalence of ED was 58.5%. ED was mild in 30.1%, mild to moderate in 19.5%, moderate in 6.1%, and severe in 2.5%. ED medications were used by 19% of men. In the univariate analysis, the variables associated with all degrees of ED were older age, longer time since HIV diagnosis, higher scores in HAD, not taking efavirenz, taking etravirine, taking ritonavir, HIV/Hepatitis C Virus coinfection, and taking a protease inhibitor-containing regimen. For mild to moderate, moderate, and severe ED, the same variables were significant, as were lower nadir CD4 cell count, lower social support, taking atazanavir, concomitant conditions, and concomitant treatments. The variables that remained significant in the multivariate analyses, considering all degrees of ED or excluding mild ED were the following: older age and higher scores in HAD total. In summary, ED affected more than half of this cohort of well controlled HIV-infected men. Age and emotional status seemed to play a fundamental role in its presence."
2430,0.003,3.0,"As thymocyte infection may represent one of the mechanisms responsible for CD4+ T lymphocyte depletion in HIV-1-infected individuals, we studied the occurrence of HIV-1 infection in the thymus in vivo. Thymus (THYPD) and peripheral blood (PBLPD) primary viral isolates were obtained from an HIV-1-infected patient; restriction pattern analysis revealed the presence of a viral variant (THY) in the thymus isolate, from which biological viral clones containing this variant were obtained by limiting dilution infection of Molt-3 cells. The biological phenotype of the viral isolates and THY clones was studied in different cell lines and primary cultures. PBLPD, THYPD, and THY clones could efficiently infect T cell lines; the thymic variant showed a higher cytopathic activity in T cell lines, and a higher replication capacity in both unfractionated and CD4+CD8(+)-enriched primary thymocytes. Sequence analysis of the viral population patterns in vivo confirmed the presence of the THY variant in the thymic compartment, and revealed that the degree of V3 loop heterogeneity was higher in the thymocytes of the patient than in the peripheral blood lymphocytes. In addition to confirming thymocyte infection in vivo, our data also indicate that a differential distribution of viral variants may occur among different body compartments in a single individual; the emergence of cytopathic and tissue-specific variants in the thymus may play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease."

The association of HPV16 and 18 variant lineages with race, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, CD4+ T-cell count, HIV-RNA level, time-to-clearance of HPV infection and presence of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) among women in the Women's Interagency HIV Study was studied. Subjects were followed semi-annually with Pap smear and cervicovaginal lavage (CVL). HPV DNA was detected in CVLs using MY09/11 L1 PCR assay. Specimens positive for HPV16/18 underwent E6 PCR and sequencing to determine the variant present. Specimens from 195 HPV16- and 162 HPV18-positive women were classified into variant lineages based on sequencing results. African variants of HPV16 and HPV18 were significantly more prevalent among African-Americans than among Caucasians [42 versus 14 % (P=0.001) and 60 versus 13 % (P<0.001), respectively]. However, it was not possible to detect associations between the HPV16 or 18 variant lineages and other factors studied. African variants of HPV16/18 were more common in women of African descent living outside Africa, which could reflect mixing behaviours and/or immunogenetic factors. However, in a large population of HIV-infected women, the variant of HPV16 or 18 was unrelated to persistence of infection or presence of SIL. If non-European variants are more oncogenic, the effect may involve a late stage in cervical tumorigenesis."
9519,0.003,3.0,"Aging with HIV poses unique and complex challenges, including avoidance of neurocognitive disorder. Our objective here is to identify the prevalence and predictors of successful cognitive aging (SCA) in a sample of older adults with HIV. One hundred three HIV-infected individuals aged 50 and older were recruited from the Modena HIV Metabolic Clinic in Italy. Participants were treated with combination antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 year and had suppressed plasma HIV viral load. SCA was defined as the absence of neurocognitive impairment (as defined by deficits in tasks of episodic learning, information processing speed, executive function, and motor skills) depression, and functional impairment (instrumental activities of daily living). In cross-sectional analyses, odds of SCA were assessed in relation to HIV-related clinical data, HIV-Associated Non-AIDS (HANA) conditions, multimorbidity (≥2HANA conditions), and frailty. A frailty index was calculated as the number of deficits present out of 37 health variables. SCA was identified in 38.8% of participants. Despite no differences in average chronologic age between groups, SCA participants had significantly fewer HANA conditions, a lower frailty index, and were less likely to have hypertension. In addition, hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 0.40, p = .04), multimorbidity (OR = 0.35, p = .05), and frailty (OR = 0.64, p = .04) were significantly associated with odds of SCA. Frailty is associated with the likelihood of SCA in people living with HIV. This defines an opportunity to apply knowledge from geriatric population research to people aging with HIV to better appreciate the complexity of their health status."
3664,0.003,3.0,"Individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are generally divided into asymptomatic healthy carriers and patients with chronic liver disease. Several studies have suggested that the core antigen (HBcAg) could be an immunological target of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). To investigate the possible pressure site from CTL, the entire core region of HBV DNA was sequenced in 30 subjects (10 asymptomatic healthy carriers and 20 patients with chronic liver disease). No significant changes in the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid residue were noted in the 10 healthy carriers. In contrast, a cluster of changes in small segment of 18 amino acids (codon 84 to 101 from the start of the core gene) was found in 15 of the 20 chronic liver disease patients. All these 15 patients had advanced liver diseases (chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis), whereas only mild liver disease (chronic persistent hepatitis) was found in the 5 patients without mutation. These data suggest that this region with clustering mutations may play an important role in the pathogenesis of B viral liver disease, and the mutations in the region may be related to progressive liver disease."

We conducted a retrospective study in 300 PLHIV attending an HIV care clinic in Ethiopia to assess ICF performance during a 12-month period. Between 80% and 95% of patients were screened for TB at enrolment and at each 3-month follow-up visit. Thirty-four (11%) patients were diagnosed with TB, of whom 27 (79%) were identified in the first 6 months.

5222,0.003,3.0,"There are limited data on the efficacy of T cell-based assays to detect tuberculosis (TB) antigen-specific responses in immune-deficient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. The aim of this study is to determine whether TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in patients with HIV-1 infection, especially in those with advanced disease (CD4 T cell count < 300 cells/microl). An enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, which detects interferon (IFN)-gamma secreted by T cells exposed to TB antigens, was used to assess specific immune responses in a prospective study of 201 HIV-1-infected patients with risk factors for TB infection, attending a single HIV unit. The performance of the ELISPOT assay to detect TB antigen-specific immune responses is independent of CD4 T cell counts in HIV-1 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis does not differ significantly from values obtained in immunocompetent subjects. The negative predictive value of the TB ELISPOT test is 98.2%. A positive predictive value of 86% for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis was found when the combined number of early secretory antigen target-6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein-10 (CFP-10) IFN-gamma spots to CD4 T cell count ratio was > 1.5. TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in HIV patients with low CD4 T cell counts using ELISPOT technology in a routine diagnostic laboratory and is a useful test to exclude TB infection in immune-deficient HIV-1 patients. A combination of TB antigen-specific IFN-gamma responses and CD4 T cell counts has the potential to distinguish active tuberculosis from latent infection."

5150,0.003,3.0,"People with HIV and AIDS are living much longer today, thanks to a better understanding of the disease process and the development of effective antiviral drugs and multidrug therapies. Consequently, HIV is now considered a chronic disease, one that affects nearly 40 million people worldwide. Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), first instituted in 1996, has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of perinatally infected children; however, in 2004, there were still 640,000 children under the age of 15 living with HIV worldwide.1 This population of patients faces more mature health issues compared to most children their age. For example, rampant dental decay is common among children with HIV and requires advanced treatment planning that needs to be closely coordinated with members of the medical team. Maintaining good oral health in combination with medication compliance leads to sustained overall health in HIV-infected children; however, many of the medications these children take have severe adverse effects on their oral health. Furthermore, these medications may interfere with other medications that are prescribed or administered in connection with oral health care. Lastly, the systemic and oral manifestations of HIV and AIDS are different for children than they are for adults; as a result, the prognosis and treatment options for these manifestations vary, depending on the patient's age. This article will address factors that affect the oral health of HIV-infected children and adults, as well as common oral manifestations of HIV and AIDS. Key differences in treatment planning for HIV-infected children and HIV-infected adults will be outlined."
8650,0.003,3.0,"Characterization of virus-specific immune responses to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is important to understanding the early virus-host interactions that may determine the course of virus infection and disease. Using a comprehensive panel of serological assays, we have previously demonstrated a complex and lengthy maturation of virus-specific antibody responses elicited by attenuated strains of SIV that was closely associated with the development of protective immunity. In the present study, we expand these analyses to address several questions regarding the nature of the virus-specific antibody responses to pathogenic SIV, SIV/HIV-1 (SHIV), and HIV-1 infections. The results demonstrate for the first time a common theme of antibody maturation to SIV, SHIV, and HIV-1 infections that is characterized by ongoing changes in antibody titer, conformational dependence, and antibody avidity during the first 6 to 10 months following virus infection. We demonstrate that this gradual evolution of virus-specific antibody responses is independent of the levels of virus replication and the pathogenicity of the infection viral strain. While the serological assays used in these studies were useful in discriminating between protective and nonprotective antibody responses during evaluation of vaccine efficacy with attenuated SIV, these same assays do not distinguish the clinical outcome of infection in pathogenic SIV, SHIV, or HIV-1 infections. These results likely reflect differences in the immune mechanisms involved in mediating protection from virus challenge compared to those that control an established viral infection, and they suggest that additional characteristics of both humoral and cellular responses evolve during this early immune maturation."
7696,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global public health concern. HBV causes chronic infection in patients and can lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and other severe liver diseases. Thus, understanding HBV-related pathogenesis is of particular importance for prevention and clinical intervention. HBV surface antigens are indispensable for HBV virion formation and are useful viral markers for diagnosis and clinical assessment. During chronic HBV infection, HBV genomes may acquire and accumulate mutations and deletions, leading to the expression of defective HBV surface antigens. These defective HBV surface antigens have been found to play important roles in the progression of HBV-associated liver diseases. In this review, we focus our discussion on the nature of defective HBV surface antigen mutations and their contribution to the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis B. The relationship between defective surface antigens and occult HBV infection are also discussed."

The authors aimed to elucidate the relation by using a large community-based sample with a wide range of liver conditions. Between October 1997 and February 1998, 2,327 consecutive subjects (aged > or =35 years) were enrolled at the public health facility in Taiwan. Blood sugar, hepatitis B surface antigen, and antibody for HCV (anti-HCV) were tested. Abdominal sonography was performed on viral-hepatitis-positive subjects. In univariate analysis, older age, lower educational levels, sedentary work, body mass index of > or 25 kg/m2, and anti-HCV positivity were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (p<0.05), but smoking, alcohol consumption, gender, and hepatitis B surface antigen status were not. In multivariate logistic regression, anti-HCV positivity was strongly associated with type 2 diabetes in subjects aged 35-49 years (odds ratio (OR)=3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4, 8.0) and 50-64-years (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.5). Sonographic evidence of fatty liver (OR=2.4, 95% CI: 1.2, 4.8) and chronic liver disease (OR=2.0, 95% CI: 1.0, 4.2) in anti-HCV-positive subjects was moderately associated with type 2 diabetes after age and gender adjustment.

The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of previous or occult HBV infection in a cohort of hepatitis B surface antigen-negative patients with histologically advanced chronic hepatitis C in the United States who did or did not develop HCC. Stored sera from 91 patients with HCC and 182 matched controls who participated in the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial were tested for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), hepatitis B surface antibody, and HBV DNA. Frozen liver samples from 28 HCC cases and 55 controls were tested for HBV DNA by way of real-time polymerase chain reaction. Anti-HBc (as a marker of previous HBV infection) was present in the serum of 41.8% HCC cases and 45.6% controls (P=0.54); anti-HBc alone was present in 16.5% of HCC cases and 24.7% of controls. HBV DNA was detected in the serum of only one control subject and no patients with HCC.

5461,0.003,3.0,"HIV-infected persons entering the criminal justice system (CJS) often experience suboptimal healthcare system engagement and social instability, including homelessness. We evaluated surveys from a multisite study of 743 HIV-infected jail detainees prescribed or eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART) to understand correlates of healthcare engagement prior to incarceration, focusing on differences by housing status. Dependent variables of healthcare engagement were: (1) having an HIV provider, (2) taking ART, and (3) being adherent (≥95% of prescribed doses) to ART during the week before incarceration. Homeless subjects, compared to their housed counterparts, were significantly less likely to be engaged in healthcare using any measure. Despite Ryan White funding availability, insurance coverage remains insufficient among those entering jails, and having health insurance was the most significant factor correlated with having an HIV provider and taking ART.

A retrospective analysis of 28 children treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy and monthly paclitaxel showed unexpected results with 19 children in complete and sustainable remission, including those with the most severe form. Tolerance and feasibility were good, despite a lack of skilled staff in a low-resource setting."
2321,0.003,3.0,"Pediatric HIV-1 infection presents remarkable features that are distinct from those observed in adult infection. In vertically HIV-1-infected children, the viral load declines more slowly, and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response emerges late, only after the sixth month of life. This response generally tends to be narrow and less intense than that seen in adults. While the nuances of immune response at the cellular level during pediatric HIV-1 infection have been addressed, there is a lack of studies focusing on the consequences of this delayed and narrowed immune response at the population level. To better explore these features, we evaluated the selection regimen in gag, pol and env gene fragments of HIV-1 during pediatric infection. We estimated the number of nonsynonymous substitutions (d(N)) and synonymous substitutions (d(S)) codon-by-codon, using the maximum likelihood method and a modified counting method. Notably, both methods indicated a similar intensity of selection (measure by mean d(N)/d(S) ratio) between children and adults. Additionally, sites under positive selection were equally distributed along HIV genes and the location of these sites was analogous between children and adults. Therefore, the selective regimen in HIV during pediatric infection is equally broad and intense likewise the observed in adults. Unexpectedly, our phylogenetic-based analysis enabled us to identify two regions in the env gene of HIV with distinct adaptive functions. The first region, located in the vicinity of V3 loop, contains sites that might increase viral fitness within-host during antibody attack and virus-cell interaction. The second region, restricted to amino acids 334-368 of Gp160, contains sites that might increase viral fitness during interhost transmission at the population level."

The patients were enrolled in the Lyon section of the French Hospital Database on HIV between 1992 and 2002. Baseline characteristics were analysed. The detection of HCV-antibodies (Ab) was used for diagnosis. The HCV-Ab prevalence rate was 5.7 and 12.89% for individuals infected by HIV after homosexual intercourse or heterosexual intercourse, respectively. HCV-Ab was three times more frequently found among patients infected with HIV after heterosexual intercourse compared with patients infected with HIV after homosexual intercourse (adjusted OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 2.28-4.62, multiple logistic regression). The risk of HCV infection among HIV-infected individuals differed according to sexual behaviour. The determinants associated with HCV transmission through the sexual route needs to be explored further."
1336,0.003,3.0,"Combination therapy can successfully suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in patients but selects for drug resistance, requiring subsequent resistance-guided therapeutic changes. This report describes the development and validation of a novel assay that offers a uniform method to measure susceptibility to all clinically approved HIV type 1 (HIV-1) drugs targeting reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR), integrase (IN), and viral entry. It is an assay in which the antiviral effect on infection within a single replication cycle is measured in triply transfected U87.CD4.CXCR4.CCR5 cells, based on homologous recombination between patient-derived amplicons and molecular proviral clones tagged with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene and from which certain viral genomic regions are removed. The deletions stretch from p17 codon 7 to PR codon 98 in pNL4.3-DeltagagPR-EGFP, from PR codons 1 to 99 in pNL4.3-DeltaPR-EGFP, from RT codons 1 to 560 in pNL4.3-DeltaRT-EGFP, from IN codons 1 to 288 in pNL4.3-DeltaIN-EGFP, and from gp120 codon 34 to gp41 codon 237 in pNL4.3-Deltaenv-EGFP. The optimized experimental conditions enable the investigation of patient samples regardless of viral subtype or coreceptor use. The extraction and amplification success rate for a set of clinical samples belonging to a broad range of HIV-1 group M genetic forms (A-J, CRF01-03, CRF05, and CRF12-13) and displaying a viral load range of 200 to >500,000 RNA copies/ml was 97%. The drug susceptibility measurements, based on discrimination between infected and noninfected cells on a single-cell level by flow cytometry, were reproducible, with coefficients of variation for resistance ranging from 7% to 31%, and were consistent with scientific literature in terms of magnitude and specificity."
2224,0.003,3.0,"CXCR4 is the major co-receptor used by X4 strains of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1). In HIV-1-infected patients, the appearance of X4 strains (T cell line-tropic) correlates with disease progression. Since its discovery, the CXCR4 co-receptor has been a major target for different agents which block its function, such as stromal-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) and the anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody, 12G5. In the present studies, the 12G5 hybridoma was used to construct a single-chain variable antibody fragment (SFv). Murine leukemia virus (MLV) and simian virus 40 (SV(40)) were utilized as delivery vehicles for the anti-CXCR4 SFv. Intracellular expression of the anti-CXCR4 SFv led to down-regulation of this critical co-receptor, as demonstrated by immunostaining. This effect significantly and specifically protected transduced cells from challenge with HIV-1, as measured by HIV-1 p24 antigen expression. Inhibition of HIV-1 replication was specific for X4 HIV-1 strains as demonstrated by MAGI assays. HeLa-CD4/betagal-CCR5 cells expressing the anti-CXCR4 SFv showed significant inhibition of infectivity by the X4 HIV-1 strain NL4-3, but not with the R5 HIV-1 strain Bal. Thus, this anti-HIV-1 molecular therapy has the potential to inhibit HIV-1 replication and virion spread. Targeting CXCR4 by intracellular immunization could be of additional benefit to certain HIV-1-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)."
9435,0.003,3.0,"Approximately 5% of people with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection remain free of disease for 10 or more years. These long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs) exhibit lower viral loads and stable CD4+ lymphocyte counts. The immunologic basis for this disease-free condition is not known. Because cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) constitute a major immune defense mechanism for sustained recovery from viral infections, we analyzed HIV-specific CTL responses in three asymptomatic LTNPs. We observed the presence of HIV-1 envelope-specific CTL responses mediated by HLA class I C-restricted CD8+ cells in these individuals. Using autologous target cells and a panel of HLA-matching and -mismatching B-cell lines as targets, we determined that HLA-Cw7 is the restricting element for the observed CTL activity. Additionally, we identified three peptides, one previously not reported, from conserved regions in the envelope protein as CTL epitopes. We previously reported these peptides to be efficient in inducing HIV-specific cellular immune responses in murine and nonhuman primate models. Our results support the role of the HLA-C locus in generating CTL responses and constitute the first report of an HLA-Cw7-restricted HIV-1 envelope-specific CTL response in HIV+ LTNPs, which may be important in the control of HIV replication in vivo."
4807,0.003,3.0,"The treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin leads to a sustained virologic response in around 50% of patients with HCV genotype 1, 65% with HCV genotype 4, 75% with HCV genotype 3 and around 80% with HCV genotype 2. A better understanding of the HCV life-cycle recently resulted in the development of several potential direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) targeting viral proteins (NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5B nucleos(t)idic and non nucleos(t)idic polymerase inhibitors, NS5A replication complex inhibitors). A lot of data have been reported with the combinations of pegylated interferon-alfa/ribavirin and the first generation oral DAAs, Telaprevir and Boceprevir. These regimens have demonstrated a high level of antiviral efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in treatment-naïve patients and in prior non-responders to pegylated interferon-alfa/ribavirin. After this first major step, the combination of the second generation DAAs with pegylated interferon-alfa/ribavirin will impact antiviral potency and tolerance and will reduce the duration of therapies and the pill burden. The next step will be the oral combination of new DAAs which is likely to become the standard of care for chronic HCV after 2015. Most studies are conducted in small numbers of ""easy-to-treat"" patients with short post-treatment period for concluding to a sustained virologic response: extension of both the numbers of treated patients and post-treatment follow-up, inclusion of more difficult-to-treat patients (experienced genotype 3-infected or genotype 1-infected patients who failed to first generation protease inhibitors, cirrhotic, HIV co-infected patients, allograft recipients or candidates to transplantation) will probably reduce the overall rate of cure.

8189,0.003,3.0,"The purpose of this report is to determine the influence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic on medical students' training and career plans through a prospective, anonymous self-administered survey of 10 Likert-scaled (1 strongly agree to 5 strongly disagree) responses to statements assessing attitude toward patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adequacy of knowledge and experience with HIV, and influence of HIV on career choices. The study was done at a major AIDS referral university teaching hospital. The participants were first- through fourth-year medical students in spring 1990. A 72% (of 451 students) response revealed that both surgery and emergency medicine were perceived as high risk of exposure specialties. Students indicated an overall willingness to care for HIV-positive patients (mean, 2.54) and a general adequacy of knowledge and experience (mean 2.54). The AIDS epidemic has had little influence for training, future career, and practice locations (mean, 4.06). Responses differed by class year. The later class years were more willing to care for HIV patients (P < .001) and indicated more knowledge and experience with HIV (P < .001). Influence on career, training and practice location choices were without class trend. In contrast to some studies, this group of medical students had relatively positive attitudes toward patients with HIV and were not particularly influenced by the AIDS epidemic regarding career choices."

A systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis was conduct to evaluate how ARV adverse drug reactions may influence ARV adherence. Thirty-nine articles were identified, and 33 reported that ARV adverse drug reactions decreased adherence and six studies found no influence. Visually noticeable adverse drug reactions and psychological adverse reactions were reported as more likely to cause non-adherence compared to other adverse drug reactions. Six studies reported a range of adverse reactions associated with EFV-containing regimens contributing to decreased adherence. Informing HIV-infected individuals about ARV adverse drug reactions prior to initiation, counselling about coping mechanisms, and experiencing the effectiveness of ARVs on wellbeing may improve ARV adherence."
5802,0.003,3.0,"In the era of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) in which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection affected children can expect a better prognosis, the importance of careful follow up of pediatric HIV-1 cases for neurological complications has been growing. We present a case of hemorrhagic Moyamoya syndrome in a child with congenital HIV-1 infection. A 10-year-old girl was referred to our hospital for the treatment of Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP: Pneumocystis pneumonia). Her HIV-1 control was poor and Moyamoya syndrome was found during the opportunistic infection screening at admission. Despite subsequent successful treatment of PCP and HIV-1 infection, we could not save her life due to the intracranial hemorrhage caused by Moyamoya syndrome. A few reported cases of Moyamoya syndrome associated with HIV-1 infection have shown negative outcomes when the control of HIV-1 infection is unsuccessful. Recently ""HIV-associated vasculopathy"" has been used to describe the cerebrovascular disorder related to HIV-1 infection that is caused by the endothelial dysfunction induced from chronic inflammation and cytokine imbalances due to HIV-1 infection. We assumed that ""HIV-associated vasculopathy"" may have contributed to the development of collateral vessels impairment related to the bleeding, although the mechanism of vascular damage with HIV-1 infection is not yet well defined. Therefore proper management of the HIV-1 infection is crucial for Moyamoya syndrome with HIV-1 cases. Furthermore it is better to take into account the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage when considering the indication and timing of the revascularization surgery, although generally hemorrhaging is rare in Moyamoya disease in children."

A genotype A2 strain emerged with 2 major mutations in the S gene, sK122R and sD144E. Molecular and biological analyses strongly suggested reactivation of a latent HBV infection. The importance and the molecular basis of these 2 epitopes in immune-escape mechanisms and host-virus interactions are discussed."
311,0.003,3.0,"Atazanavir is the first once-daily protease inhibitor for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection and should be used only in combination therapy, as part of a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen. In addition to being the most potent protease inhibitor in vitro, atazanavir has a distinct cross-resistance profile that does not confer resistance to other protease inhibitors. However, resistance to other protease inhibitors often confers clinically relevant resistance to atazanavir. Currently, atazanavir is not a preferred protease inhibitor for initial HAART regimens. In treatment-naive patients, atazanavir can be given as 400 mg/day. However, atazanavir should be pharmacologically boosted with ritonavir in treatment-experienced patients or when coadministered with either tenofovir or efavirenz. Patients who receive atazanavir experience similar rates of adverse events compared with patients receiving comparator regimens. An exception is an increased risk of asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia, which is due to competitive inhibition of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. Although hyperbilirubinemia is a common adverse drug reaction of atazanavir therapy (22-47%), fewer than 2% of patients discontinue atazanavir therapy because of this adverse effect. Common adverse effects reported with atazanavir include infection, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, peripheral neuropathy, and rash. Of significance, fewer abnormalities have been observed in plasma lipid profiles in patients treated with atazanavir compared with other protease inhibitor-containing regimens. As with other protease inhibitors, atazanavir is also a substrate and moderate inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, in particular CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Clinically significant drug interactions include (but are not limited to) antacids, proton pump inhibitors, histamine type 2 receptor antagonists, tenofovir, diltiazem, irinotecan, simvastatin, lovastatin, St. John's wort, and warfarin. We conclude that atazanavir is a distinctively characteristic protease inhibitor owing to its in vitro potency, once-daily dosing, distinct initial resistance pattern, and infrequent association with metabolic abnormalities."
7652,0.003,3.0,"AL 721, a lipid mixture with reported in vitro activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) via cell membrane or virion cholesterol depletion, was evaluated in a multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging trial. Forty men with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy or AIDS-related complex were treated with doses of 20, 30, 40, or 50 g orally twice daily for 8 weeks, and monitored for toxicity, disease progression, and with immunologic, virologic, and serum lipid profiles. The compound was found to be well tolerated over the broad range of doses examined; adverse reactions were confined to the gastrointestinal tract, of mild to moderate severity, and self-limited in duration. Modest weight gains observed on treatment were reversed within 4 weeks following cessation of therapy. While disease progression was not observed in this short-term study, we could find no indication of an immunorestorative or antiviral effect of AL 721, as determined by T-lymphocyte subset quantitation or HIV culture. All three patients who were HIV p24 antigenemic at entry retained positive antigen levels throughout treatment. As a consequence of therapy, however, significant increases in serum lipids were observed, including elevations in both triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. In conclusion, our experience on the largest group of HIV-infected patients treated with the highest doses of AL 721 provides no support for the use of this compound as an antiretroviral agent."

Ninety-nine patients received zidovudine, of whom 75% were males, 92% were minorities, and 59% had a history of intravenous drug use. Of the 99 patients, 72 had AIDS and 27 had ARC with T-helper (CD4) lymphocytes less than or equal to 500 mm3. Eighty-seven of the 99 patients (88%) were compliant with zidovudine therapy. Fifty-seven percent of these had at least one adverse drug reaction requiring dose reduction (44%) or cessation (13%). Adverse reactions were similar to those reported in other populations with HIV-related illness, although headache and nausea were less common. Twenty opportunistic infections (OIs) or HIV-related malignancies occurred in 15 of 82 (18%) patients who were on zidovudine for at least 4 weeks (7.6 OIs/1,000 patient weeks). Seven of the 82 died (9%), compared to 9 of the 17 patients (53%) who did not complete 4 weeks of zidovudine therapy (p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in any of these measures when intravenous drug users were compared with other risk groups. We conclude that zidovudine can be administered to intravenous drug users and others in an inner city clinic with acceptable compliance and tolerance."
3672,0.003,3.0,"The effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 on human mononuclear phagocyte effector functions in response to infection with bacteria of the Mycobacterium avium-intracellular complex (MAC) was investigated. The results showed that interaction of HIV-1 or its constituents with CD4 expressed in the monocyte membrane led to substantial impairment of monocyte capacity to restrict the intracellular growth of MAC. This was accompanied by substantially decreased production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha by HIV-1-exposed and MAC-infected monocytes. However, productive HIV-1 infection of monocytes was not required to induce the observed effects. These studies suggest that HIV-1 may interfere with innate mononuclear phagocyte function. This may be of physiologic importance in the late stages of AIDS, when an impaired T cell immunity can no longer provide proper immune-activating signals, and may help to explain the undue susceptibility to MAC infections in these patients."
359,0.003,3.0,"To prevent transmission of bloodborne pathogens, it is important that health care providers adhere to standard precautions, follow fundamental infection-control principles, and use appropriate procedural techniques. All obstetrician-gynecologists who provide clinical care should receive the hepatitis B virus vaccine series. The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America has established guidelines for the management of health care providers who are infected with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The guidelines categorize representative obstetric and gynecologic procedures according to level of risk of bloodborne pathogen transmission and include recommendations for health care provider clinical activities, based on these categories and viral burden. It is important to note that when no restrictions are recommended, careful supervision should be carried out as highlighted. These recommendations provide a framework within which to consider such cases; however, each case should be independently considered in context by the expert review panel. "
7572,0.003,3.0,"Psychiatric disorders are common among people living with HIV in Nigeria. Adherence is necessary to optimise the outcome of antiretroviral therapy. In this study, we aimed to identify associations between antiretroviral adherence, measured by one-week and one-month self-reported missed doses, and psychiatric illness in a cohort previously assessed for psychiatric disorders using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The study participants comprised 151 adults with major depression, anxiety or suicidal symptoms, and 302 matched-control participants. Two controls were randomly selected for each case within the same gender and education level. We compared participants with psychiatric disorders (WPDs) and no psychiatric disorders (NPDs) on selected demographic and clinical variables, in addition to adherence. Participants with one or more missed doses in the preceding month had twice the odds of having a major depressive episode as those with no missed doses during this period (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.03, 4.79). This association remained significant after adjusting for selected risk factors. There was no statistically significant difference between WPD and NPD groups on either one-week or one-month adherence, or on age, marital status, occupational class, HIV viral load at enrolment or current CD4 cell count. Among Nigerian adults with HIV, suboptimal antiretroviral adherence is associated with, and could be a sign of, depression. Routine self-report adherence assessments may potentially be utilised in identifying individuals at risk among this population."

This field adds value to more traditional health research by contributing to the design and testing of complex integrated models of change, to examine health system performance and patient outcomes. Using selected milestones in HIV care management to frame our simulation research, we created a SD model to examine three patient subgroups of women of color (WOC) represented in our multi-site cohort, classified by their health care seeking status at baseline. Asked to reflect on their circumstance 6 months prior to enrollment in the MSE cohort, 53% noted they were receiving some care (In Care, n = 341), 31% that they had been seeking care (Seeking Care, n = 201), and 16% that they were undecided about seeking care (i.e., answered that they may or may not look for care) for treatment of their HIV (May or May Not Seek Care, n = 103). Our SD model compared simulated patterns of patient retention over 24 months in relation to: (1) access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), (2) adherence to ART, and (3) viral suppression. Assessed patterns yielded insights about system capacities and constraints in the context of the SPNS initiative under evaluation."

We investigated a 1996 outbreak of infection with influenza A at a residential facility for persons with AIDS. We interviewed 118 residents and employees, reviewed 65 resident medical records, and collected serum samples for measurement of influenza antibody titers. After controlling for history of smoking, influenza vaccination, and resident or employee status, in a multivariate model, HIV infection was not statistically associated with influenza-like illness (ILI). Symptoms and duration of ILI were similar for most HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected persons. However, 8 (21.1%) of 38 HIV-infected persons with ILI (vs. none of 15 HIV-uninfected persons) were either hospitalized, evaluated in an emergency room, or had ILI lasting > or = 14 days (P=.06). Vaccination effectiveness (VE) was similar for HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected persons. Vaccination was most effective among HIV-infected persons with CD4 cell counts of >100 cells/microL (VE, 65%; 95% CI, 36%--81%) or HIV type 1 virus load of <30,000 copies/mL (VE, 52%; 95% CI, 11%--75%).

Median age at presentation was 67 years, and five were female. Nine were asymptomatic at presentation, six presented with varices, five with malaise, three with abdominal pain, one with pruritus and one with oedema. Risk factors identified were: transfusion (7), haemodialysis (1), health care worker (dentist) (1), and tattoos (2). There was no recognized risk factor for infection in 14, but five of these had done military service in areas of high HCV prevalence. Liver biopsy in 20 showed chronic hepatitis in two, cirrhosis in 12, and cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in six. Three additional patients also developed hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV genotyping was done in 19 and all were type 1 (1a, 4; 1b, 14; 1 untypable, 1).

8052,0.003,3.0,"Recent studies using laboratory clones have demonstrated that several antiretroviral protease inhibitors (PIs) inhibit the growth of Plasmodium falciparum at concentrations that may be of clinical significance, especially during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and malaria coinfection. Using clinical isolates, we now demonstrate the in vitro effectiveness of two HIV-1 aspartic PIs, saquinavir (SQV) and ritonavir (RTV), against P. vivax (n = 30) and P. falciparum (n = 20) from populations subjected to high levels of mefloquine and artesunate pressure on the Thailand-Myanmar border. The median 50% inhibitory concentration values of P. vivax to RTV and SQV were 2,233 nM (range, 732 to 7,738 nM) and 4,230 nM (range, 1,326 to 8,452 nM), respectively, both within the therapeutic concentration range commonly found for patients treated with these PIs. RTV was fourfold more effective at inhibiting P. vivax than it was at inhibiting P. falciparum, compared to a twofold difference in SQV sensitivity. An increased P. falciparum mdr1 copy number was present in 33% (3/9) of isolates and that of P. vivax mdr1 was present in 9% of isolates (2/22), but neither was associated with PI sensitivity. The inter-Plasmodium sp. variations in PI sensitivity indicate key differences between P. vivax and P. falciparum. PI-containing antiretroviral regimens may demonstrate prophylactic activity against both vivax and falciparum malaria in HIV-infected patients who reside in areas where multidrug-resistant P. vivax or P. falciparum is found."
36,0.003,3.0,"There is increasing evidence that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection of an immunosuppressed host is associated with the appearance of virus mutants. To characterize the virus circulating in patients in detail, eleven full-length HBV genomes, isolated from the serum of five highly viraemic renal transplant recipients with liver disease, were cloned and sequenced. The genomes contained deletions in the C gene, deletions in the pre-S1/2 region frequently removing the pre-S2 initiation codon, premature termination codons in the pre-S1 or S region, and/or deletions/insertions in the X gene/core promoter. The mutations occurred at different positions and in various combinations; even mutant genomes circulating within a patient differed strikingly. It is concluded that long-term immunosuppression is associated with the occurrence of heterogeneous populations of partially defective HBV characterized by a specific mutation pattern. Efficient intracellular trans-complementation probably enables high virus replication in vivo."
9097,0.003,3.0,"Mutants of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the pre-core/core gene exist in patients chronically infected with HBV. The core gene of HBV DNA is preceded by the pre-core region which takes a role of synthesis and secretion of HBe antigen (HBeAg). Previous studies have suggested that products of the core gene could be immunological targets of cytotoxic T lymphocytes as well as those of variant pre-core genes and subsequently, that the clinical courses of HBV carriers might be influenced due to infected HBV variants. In this study, we therefore examined mutations in the core gene of HBV DNA on strains with or without a translational stop codon at the 28th codon of the pre-core region, using allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes and PCR-direct sequencing. The analysis of nucleotide sequences (codon 27-100) of HBV DNA in anti-HBe positive sera showed that there were two hypervariable segments of codon 31-49 and codon 87-97, where amino acid substitutions of L31I, S49T, S87G/N, K96N and I87F/1 frequently occurred regardless of the presence or absence of the mutation in the pre-core region. Meanwhile, less mutations were detected in the core gene of HBV DNA in HBeAg positive sera. Furthermore, we could identify the mutations at codon 87, 96 and 97 by using nonradioactive probes in a good coincidence with results by PCR-direct sequencing. The ASO probe method is useful for detection of mutations in the core gene in many specimens."
5592,0.003,3.0,"After initial infection with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), patients may remain asymptomatic for years before the onset of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This non-aggressive or latent phase may be manifested by functional abnormalities of both T and B cells, even in the absence of critical reductions in lymphocyte numbers. At present, it is not clear whether the immune abnormalities in either the asymptomatic phase or in clinical AIDS are due solely to direct effects of HIV-1 or whether they also reflect host immunoregulatory mechanisms. In this article, by Charles Via, Herbert Morse and Gene Shearer, the immune abnormalities associated with early HIV-1 infection are compared with immune abnormalities found in three murine models of autoimmunity and immunodeficiency, and it is suggested that host mechanisms contribute to defective helper T (TH)-cell function early in the course of HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, two murine models appear relevant to the study of late HIV-1 infection and suggest a role for CD8+ T cells in the prevention of symptomatic AIDS."

An 18-year-old Japanese man with HIV and HBV co-infection presented to our hospital. His CD4 count was decreased, and TDF-based HARRT was started. At 30 months after initiation of therapy, HBsAg was not detected. At 36 months after initiation of therapy, HBsAb was detected. We conclude that TDF-based therapy is useful for the management of patients with HBV and HIV co-infection. "
1267,0.003,3.0,"The study objectives were to determine the early effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection on both phenotypic and functional immunologic markers in healthy homosexual men, to ascertain the relationships of these markers to each other, and to discover which markers were affected by enrollment in an AIDS study in which HIV-1 serostatus would be determined. The major findings were as follows. (i) The CD4/CD8 ratio and lymphocyte proliferative response to pokeweed mitogen were the characteristics most affected by early HIV-1 infection. (ii) The loss in CD4 cells observed in the HIV-1-positive homosexual men was entirely due to diminished numbers of the memory subset. CD4+ CD29+. The reciprocal subset of CD4, CD4+ CD45RA+, did not differ in the two groups of homosexual men at either time point or in the controls. (iii) Prior to learning their HIV-1 serostatus, HIV-1 antibody-negative risk-group males had lower phytohemagglutinin (PHA) responses than the controls did. In the assays following notification of their seronegativity, however, these men had PHA values which were not different from those of the controls. In the HIV-1-positive group, the responses to both PHA and pokeweed mitogen were below those of both HIV-1-negative groups and did not change after serostatus notification. (iv) The activity of natural killer cells was lower in the risk-group men than in the controls at both pre- and postdiagnosis but was not related to HIV-1 serostatus. (v) In this cohort of homosexual men, the CD4/CD8 ratio correlated significantly with the functional measures of immunologic status in the HIV-1-positive men, but not in the HIV-1-negative men."
5675,0.003,3.0,"Arginase I (Arg I) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are important in regulating immune functions through their metabolites. Previous studies have revealed that the expression of Arg I is increased and the expression of iNOS is reduced in the serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)‑infected patients. As one of the most important immune organs and HIV replication sites, whether similar changes are present in the lymph nodes following HIV infection remains to be elucidated. To investigate this, the present study collected lymph node and blood specimens from 52 HIV‑infected patients to measure the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS by immunohistochemistry and fluoresence‑based flow cytometry. Compared with control subjects without HIV infection, the patients with HIV had significantly higher expression levels of Arg I in the lymph nodes and higher frequencies of Arg I+ CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the blood and lymph nodes, and these results were contrary the those of iNOS in the corresponding compartments. The expression levels of Arg I in the lymph nodes and blood were negatively associated with peripheral CD4+ T cell count and positively associated with viral load. However, the expression levels of iNOS in the lymph nodes and blood were positively associated with peripheral CD4+ T cell count and negatively associated with viral load. These results showed that alterations in the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in the peripheral T cells and peripheral nodes of HIV infected patients are associated with disease progression in these patients. These results indicate a potential to therapeutic strategy for delaying disease progression through regulating and manipulating the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in patients infected with HIV."
4964,0.003,3.0,"The Tat-responsive region (TAR) element is a critical RNA regulatory element in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat, which is required for activation of gene expression by the transactivator protein Tat. Recently, we demonstrated by gel-retardation analysis that RNA polymerase II binds to TAR RNA and that Tat prevents this binding even when Tat does not bind to TAR RNA. These results suggested that direct interactions between Tat and RNA polymerase II may prevent RNA polymerase II pausing and lead to Tat-mediated increases in transcriptional elongation. To test this possibility, we performed protein interaction studies with RNA polymerase II and both the HIV-1 and the closely related HIV-2 Tat protein. These studies indicated that both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat proteins could specifically interact with RNA polymerase II. Mutagenesis of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat demonstrated that the basic domains of both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat proteins were required for this interaction. Furthermore, ""far Western"" analysis suggested that the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II was the site for interaction with Tat. The interactions between Tat and RNA polymerase II were of similar magnitude to those detected between RNA polymerase II and the cellular transcription factor RAP30, which stably associates with RNA polymerase II during transcriptional elongation. These studies are consistent with the model that RNA polymerase II is a cellular target for Tat resulting in Tat-mediated increases in transcriptional elongation from the HIV long terminal repeat."
8643,0.003,3.0,"Nelfinavir mesylate (formerly AG1343) is a potent and selective, nonpeptidic inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease that was discovered by protein structure-based design methodologies. We evaluated the antiviral and cytotoxic effects of two-drug combinations of nelfinavir with the clinically approved antiretroviral therapeutics zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), dideoxycytidine (ddC; zalcitabine), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), indinavir, saquinavir, and ritonavir and a three-drug combination of nelfinavir with ZDV and 3TC against an acute HIV-1 strain RF infection of CEM-SS cells in vitro. Quantitative assessment of drug interaction was evaluated by a universal response surface approach (W. R. Greco, G. Bravo, and J. C. Parsons, Pharm. Rev. 47:331-385, 1995) and by the method of M. N. Prichard and C. Shipman (Antiviral Res. 14:181-206, 1990). Both analytical methods yielded similar results and showed that the two-drug combinations of nelfinavir with the reverse transcriptase inhibitors ZDV, 3TC, ddI, d4T, and ddC and the three-drug combination with ZDV and 3TC resulted in additive to statistically significant synergistic interactions. In a similar manner, the combination of nelfinavir with the three protease inhibitors resulted in additive (ritonavir and saquinavir) to slightly antagonistic (indinavir) interactions. In all combinations, minimal cellular cytotoxicity was observed with any drug alone and in combination. These results suggest that administration of combinations of the appropriate doses of nelfinavir with other currently approved antiretroviral therapeutic agents in vivo may result in enhanced antiviral activity with no associated increase in cellular cytotoxicity."
4437,0.003,3.0,"Evaluation of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-specific T-helper immunity could contribute in optimizing anti-HCMV therapy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Testin the lymphoproliferative response (LPR) is the standard technique used to evaluate T-helper response, but its use in the routine diagnostic laboratory setting can be problematic. The most promising new alternative technique is the determination of HCMV-specific CD4(+) T-cell frequency by flow cytometry detection of intracellular cytokine production after short-term antigen-specific activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. HCMV-specific LPR and CD4(+) T-cell frequency were compared in a group of 78 blood samples from 65 HIV-infected patients. The results showed concordance in 80.7% of samples. In addition, comparative analysis of sequential blood samples from 13 HIV-infected patients showed that while in about half of patients the T-helper HCMV-specific immune response remained stable during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), in the other half declining levels of the HCMV-specific CD4(+)-mediated immune response were determined by either one or both assays. In conclusion, our data suggest that the determination of HCMV-specific CD4(+) T-cell frequency can be considered a valuable alternative to the LPR test for the detection of HCMV-specific T-helper response in HIV-infected patients. It could facilitate wider screening of anti-HCMV T-helper activity in HIV-infected patients, with potential benefits for clinicians in deciding strategies of discontinuation or maintenance of anti-HCMV therapy."
9472,0.003,3.0,"Mycobacterial infection remains as a frequent complication associated to HIV infection. Although the widespread use of HAART has intensely decreased incidence of disseminated Mycobacterium avium (MAC) infection, it does not seem that it has affected tuberculosis occurrence so intensely. In spite of the intense search of new methods of rapid diagnosis, in the clinical practice the diagnosis of the mycobacterial illnesses continues based on culture, although the appearance of new media has allowed to shorten the time of growth. The combination of isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF) and pirazinamide (PZ) (with ethambutol [ETB] when primary resistance to INH is higher than 4%), remains as the elective treatment for tuberculosis in HIV infected patients. Due to the interaction between RIF and some antiretovirals drugs, such as proteasa inhibitors, a change in the usual regimens could be necessary. Combinations without RIF or antiretroviral therapy with drugs not interacting with RIF (nucleosides, ritonavir or nevirapin) have been suggested. The emergence of strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to the antituberculosis drugs, the lack of adherence to treatment, and the frequency of adverse events hinders even more the control of the tuberculosis and they demand a narrow follow up of these patients. The treatment of the disseminated infection by MAC has improved in the last years with the generalization of the combinations including macrolides as claritromicin or azitromicin with ETB. The doubt persists about what combination is more effective, although like in other opportunists infections associated with a severe immunodeficiency, using antiretrovirals combinations that enhance the immune system could be a fundamental therapeutic approach."
7267,0.003,3.0,"Nosocomial transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is a recognized risk in health care settings, and is a particular concern in settings where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons receive care. TB control guidelines have been effective in prevention of nosocomial TB outbreaks and protection of patients and health care workers. In 1993 a South Florida academic medical center noted an increase in TB cases, particularly in HIV-infected persons who had been inpatients. A multidisciplinary team developed an HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway as an intervention to deter nosocomial transmission of TB. The pathway was implemented in 1995 on the Special Immunology/Infectious Disease (SI/ID) inpatient unit. This paper describes an evaluation study conducted to determine the effectiveness of the pathway as an intervention to deter nosocomial TB in relation to two areas: (1) early identification of HIV-infected patients with potential TB, followed by immediate placement in respiratory isolation and (2) protection of SI/ID unit personnel from occupational TB exposure. A retrospective review was conducted in June 1999 on the medical records of all patients who had been placed on the HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway from 1995-1998. A review was also done of the medical center's confirmed TB cases, and employee health records for tuberculin skin testing (TST) of employees during this time period. The review demonstrated that all HIV-infected patients with confirmed TB had been identified, placed on the pathway and admitted to respiratory isolation at the onset of hospital admission, deterring the potential for a nosocomial TB outbreak. However, in 1998 two SI/ID staff converted from a nonreactive to a reactive TST. Although the pathway was only partially successful in TB protection for staff members, other factors may have caused the TST conversions. A study recommendation is that institutions develop an HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway, along with a Rule Out TB Pathway for patients who are not HIV-infected but present with symptoms that may be indicative of TB infection."
6658,0.003,3.0,"The public sector scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa commenced in 2004. We aimed to describe the hospital-level disease burden and factors contributing to morbidity and mortality among hospitalized HIV-positive patients in the era of widespread ART availability. Between June 2012 and October 2013, unselected patients admitted to medical wards at a public sector district hospital in Cape Town were enrolled in this cross-sectional study with prospective follow-up. HIV testing was systematically offered and HIV-infected patients were systematically screened for TB. The spectrum of admission diagnoses among HIV-positive patients was documented, vital status at 90 and 180 days ascertained and factors independently associated with death determined. Among 1018 medical admissions, HIV status was ascertained in 99.5%: 60.1% (n = 609) were HIV-positive and 96.1% (n = 585) were enrolled. Of these, 84.4% were aware of their HIV-positive status before admission. ART status was naive in 35.7%, current in 45.0%, and interrupted in 19.3%. The most frequent primary clinical diagnoses were newly diagnosed TB (n = 196, 33.5%), other bacterial infection (n = 100, 17.1%), and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illnesses other than TB (n = 64, 10.9%). By 90 days follow-up, 175 (29.9%) required readmission and 78 (13.3%) died. Commonest causes of death were TB (37.2%) and other AIDS-defining illnesses (24.4%). Independent predictors of mortality were AIDS-defining illnesses other than TB, low hemoglobin, and impaired renal function. HIV still accounts for nearly two-thirds of medical admissions in this South African hospital and is associated with high mortality. Strategies to improve linkage to care, ART adherence/retention and TB prevention are key to reducing HIV-related hospitalizations in this setting."
6533,0.003,3.0,"The complex interaction between HIV-1 infection and Mycobacterium avium was studied. Viral burden was assessed, as well as immune response to HIV-1 in the context of Myco. avium infections. We also examined serum cytokine levels and cytokine release by blood mononuclear cells in HIV-1-infected subjects, infected or not with Myco. avium. Undetectable serum levels of IL-1, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-6 were found in normal controls and in groups I, II and III of HIV-1-infected subjects. Moderate levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6 were found in the sera of group IV patients. When group IV was subdivided into subjects with and without Myco. avium infections, subjects with Myco, avium infections were shown to have higher serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 than those with other infections. Blood mononuclear cells from controls and HIV subjects were stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and cytokine levels assessed. Cells from group II patients were shown to secrete normal levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6, and lower levels of IL-1 beta; group III subjects released higher levels of IL-6. Patients in group IV had blood cells that released elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, and lower levels of IL-1 beta. Group IV subjects with Myco. avium infections had blood cells that released higher levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 than group IV subjects with other infections. Assessment of viral burden in cells of HIV-1-infected subjects revealed that Myco. avium-infected subjects had a higher level of virus burden and a lower level of lymphoproliferative response to an inactivated gp120-depleted HIV-1 antigen than AIDS subjects with other infections. These data suggest that Myco. avium infections in HIV-1-infected subjects hasten the progression of viral disease, enhance cytokine release and contribute to the anergy to viral antigens."
1548,0.003,3.0,"We sought to determine tuberculosis (TB) prevalence including multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB among a cohort of high risk patients at two directly observed treatment short course (DOTS) clinics in Delhi, India. We also aimed to compare the sensitivity of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear tests for patients with HIV using sputum cultures as the gold standard. A cross-section study was conducted among adult patients (> or = 18 years old) with prolonged cough (greater than two weeks), night sweats, fever, and/or weight loss suspected of pulmonary TB between February and March 2006. Sputum samples were obtained and processed for 165 patients; 53 (32.1%) were culture positive for TB. Patients with TB were predominantly male (92.1%), young (median age of 32 years), and the HIV-seroprevalence was high (41.5%). In the multivariable analysis adjusted for age, HIV infection was significantly associated (POR = 2.0, p < 0.05) with the presence of TB disease. Among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates recovered from 53 cases, 25 (47.2%) were resistant to > or = 1 first line anti-TB drugs and 7 (13.2%) were MDR-TB. The sensitivity of AFB smears among HIV negative and positive participants was 35.5% and 18.0%, respectively. Our findings demonstrated that the sensitivity of AFB smears to detect TB among HIV positive patients was low. Additionally, we found that even in regions where population drug resistance estimates are low, sentinel surveillance of MDR-TB in high-risk populations is useful to prioritize target groups in need of additional prevention, monitoring and health outreach."
7166,0.003,3.0,"The aim of this study is to examine whether internalized AIDS stigma among HIV patients one year after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation is associated with sociodemographic characteristics, health status, social support, quality of life (QoL), and ARV adherence. This is a prospective study of all treatment-naive patients (N=735) recruited from all three public hospitals in Uthukela health district in KwaZulu-Natal and followed up at 6 and 12 months being on ART. Results indicated that despite a decrease in stigma seen in this study (may be due to ART) the level of stigma and discrimination remains high, and stigma reduction interventions are urgently needed in this population. CD4 cell counts significantly increased and HIV symptoms reduced significantly but depression symptoms remained high and even increased after 12 months on treatment. In multivariate analysis lower CD4 cell counts (odds ratio 0.5, 0.3-0.9), severe depression (5.6, 2.5-12.5) and low QoL (0.6, 0.5-0.8) were associated with internalized AIDS stigma. These findings may suggest that HIV care should include counseling and support that includes stigma concerns, depression, and QoL prior to and during the first year following diagnosis."
9665,0.003,3.0,"To estimate the prevalence and predictors of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among inmates, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in 1994 among inmates entering six reception centers of the California Department of Corrections. Discarded serum samples were tested for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HCV, hepatitis B core, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Of 4,513 inmates in this study, 87.0% were men and 13.0% were women. Among male inmates, 39.4% were anti-HCV-positive; by race/ethnicity, prevalences were highest among whites (49.1%). Among female inmates, 53.5% were anti-HCV-positive; the prevalence was highest among Latinas (69.7%). In addition, rates for HIV were 2.5% for men and 3.1% for women; and for HBsAg, 2.2% (men) and 1.2% (women). These data indicate that HCV infection is common among both men and women entering prison. The high seroprevalence of anti-HCV-positive inmates may reflect an increased prevalence of high-risk behaviors and should be of concern to the communities to which these inmates will be released."

Sixty stored placentas were examined for PM and other placental pathology, comparing 20 HIV-infected mother-infant (perinatal transmitter) pairs, 20 HIV-uninfected pairs, and 20 HIV-infected mothers who did not transmit to their infant perinatally. Of 60 placentas examined, 45% showed evidence of PM. Placental malaria was associated with increased risk of MTCT of HIV-1 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 6.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-29.1), especially among primigravidae (aOR = 12.0; 95% CI = 1.0-150; P < 0.05). Before antiretroviral therapy or prophylaxis, PM was associated with early infant HIV infection among rural Rwandan women living in a hyper-endemic malaria region. Primigravidae, among whom malaria tends to be most severe, may be at higher risk."
1085,0.003,3.0,"Perinatal or mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains the major risk factor for chronic HBV infection worldwide. In addition to hepatitis B immune globulin and vaccination, oral antiviral therapies in highly viremic mothers can further decrease MTCT of HBV. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the evidence on the efficacy and maternal and fetal safety of antiviral therapy during pregnancy. A protocol was developed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guideline writing committee. We searched multiple databases for controlled studies that enrolled pregnant women with chronic HBV infection treated with antiviral therapy. Outcomes of interest were reduction of MTCT and adverse outcomes to mothers and newborns. Study selection and data extraction were done by pairs of independent reviewers. We included 26 studies that enrolled 3622 pregnant women. Antiviral therapy reduced MTCT, as defined by infant hepatitis B surface antigen seropositivity (risk ratio = 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.4) or infant HBV DNA seropositivity (risk ratio = 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.5) at 6-12 months. No significant differences were found in the congenital malformation rate, prematurity rate, and Apgar scores. Compared to control, lamivudine or telbivudine improved maternal HBV DNA suppression at delivery and during 4-8 weeks' postpartum follow-up. Tenofovir showed improvement in HBV DNA suppression at delivery. No significant differences were found in postpartum hemorrhage, cesarean section, and elevated creatinine kinase rates."

These data were compared with information in medical and pharmacy records. There was no evidence of bias in the patient report of date of diagnosis of HIV infection or date or result of most recent CD4 count, although there was considerable imprecision. Past and current prescription of AZT were recalled accurately by patients compared with medical records (kappa = 0.89 and 0.86, respectively), but previous HIV-related illnesses and enrollment in clinical studies or trials were generally recalled poorly (kappa < 0.4 in some cases). Data collected prospectively on prescription of drugs and use of health care services were reasonably accurately reported by patients. This analysis supports the need for routine assessment of the validity of patient-reported exposure and outcome data in epidemiological studies in order to minimize the possible biases that can result from inaccurate information."

5240,0.003,3.0,"Monocytotropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infect mononuclear phagocytes as well as activated T cells, but do not usually infect immature human myeloid cell lines in vitro. The HL-60 promyelocytic/myeloblastic cell line and the promonocytic line, U937, were susceptible to productive infection by monocytotropic HIV-1 isolates (HIV-1JR-FL and HTLV-IIIBa-L) after treatment with retinoic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, dibutyryl cAMP, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), or 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Virus production was only detected when these compounds were added before virus infection. Virus replication did not correlate with CD4 receptor expression because undifferentiated HL-60 cells express CD4 and the level of CD4 expression did not increase after differentiation in the presence of retinoic acid, 1,25(OH)2D3, or TPA. A mature monocytic cell line (THP-1) was capable of infection without pretreatment, and treatment with differentiating agents enhanced virus production. A chronically infected cell line (J-HL-60) was isolated after HIV-1JR-FL infection of HL-60 cells treated with retinoic acid. Virus production in this cell line was enhanced more than 10-fold after differentiation in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 or TPA. The majority of virus production by 1,25(OH)2D3-treated J-HL-60 cells was associated with the mature, adherent population. Molecular analysis of a cloned line of J-HL-60 showed integration of a single DNA provirus. These results suggest that cellular factors associated with precursor cell differentiation along the myelomonocytic pathway are required for optimal replication of monocytotropic HIV-1 strains in vitro."
7586,0.003,3.0,"The aim of the study was to identify high-risk groups and the determinants of late HIV diagnosis in France in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), from January 1996 to June 2005. Informations were collected from an electronic medical record of all HIV- 1-infected patients who sought care in six HIV reference centers in France, constituting a prospective multicentric cohort. Patients were defined as ""late testers"" if they had presented with either symptoms of clinical AIDS or a CD4 cell count less than 200/mm(3) during the year of diagnosis, as ""nonlate"" if their CD4 count was above 200, and as ""unknown"" if CD4 cell count in the year at the time of diagnosis was not documented. Among the 4516 patients available for analysis, the percentage of late testing was 38% (n = 1718) and decreased after 2003 (31.5% in 2004-2005). This percentage was higher in heterosexual men (48.2%) than in homosexual men (31.7%) or heterosexual women (32.6%) and was higher for patients older than 30. Heterosexual men living in a couple with children had a higher risk of late testing (odds ratio [OR] = 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 2.66), while heterosexual women in a couple without children had a lower risk (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.83). Among homosexual men, unemployment was associated with late testing (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.14 to 4.36). The proportion of late testing was still high. Groups classically identified as low risk for HIV infection, particularly heterosexual men in a couple with children, were found to be at high risk for late testing. It seems necessary to improve HIV testing policy in the heterosexual population."
7248,0.003,3.0,"A cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-discordant couples was established to evaluate risk factors associated with heterosexual viral transmission. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to document the HIV-uninfected status among members of discordant heterosexual couples and to rule out immunosilent infection. HIV DNA PCR specific for a gag gene region was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 203 HIV antibody-negative adults who have long-term heterosexual relationships with HIV-infected partners. The results were negative for 200 but consistently positive in three individuals. More extensive evaluation of these three individuals with an additional primer pair specific for the envelope gene, quantitative DNA PCR, multiple additional time points, and variable nucleotide tandem repeat analyses revealed specimen processing problems in two cases but an apparent true positive PCR assay in the third case. This subject remains antibody and PCR negative for a 32-month follow-up period. These results confirm previous studies that document a negligible incidence of occult HIV infection as delineated by PCR in antibody negative heterosexual partners of HIV-infected individuals. Specimen processing errors occur at a low rate (1% in this study) and require careful evaluation. The possibility of transient, aborted infection versus successful infection with a long immunosilent period was observed in a single individual. Definitive resolution of infection status will require long-term evaluation."
2324,0.003,3.0,"To study the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performance in detecting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, we tested 53 HIV-1 seropositive patients and 29 HIV-1 seronegative subjects for four different HIV-1 DNA regions. Fifty-one seropositive patients were found positive by PCR with at least one primer pair, but two were repeatedly negative for all primers. Weekly blood samples from 12 seropositive subjects all detected positive for at least one primer pair, but for three patients an irregular primer detection pattern was found. One additional HIV-1 seropositive sample, found negative for HIV DNA, was also negative for the beta-globin PCR control. The 29 seronegative specimens were HIV-1 DNA negative, as was a HIV-2 seropositive patient. This study demonstrates that PCR is almost as good as serological tests for detecting HIV infections, with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 96% and that resampling the patients may improve detection performance."

7158,0.003,3.0,"HIV-1 infection frequently causes HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) despite combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Evidence is accumulating that components of cART can themselves be neurotoxic upon long-term exposure. In addition, abuse of psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine, seems to aggravate HAND and compromise antiretroviral therapy. However, the combined effect of virus and recreational and therapeutic drugs on the brain is poorly understood. Therefore, we exposed mixed neuronal-glial cerebrocortical cells to antiretrovirals (ARVs) (zidovudine [AZT], nevirapine [NVP], saquinavir [SQV], and 118-D-24) of four different pharmacological categories and to methamphetamine and, in some experiments, the HIV-1 gp120 protein for 24 h and 7 days. Subsequently, we assessed neuronal injury by fluorescence microscopy, using specific markers for neuronal dendrites and presynaptic terminals. We also analyzed the disturbance of neuronal ATP levels and assessed the involvement of autophagy by using immunofluorescence and Western blotting. ARVs caused alterations of neurites and presynaptic terminals primarily during the 7-day incubation and depending on the specific compounds and their combinations with and without methamphetamine. Similarly, the loss of neuronal ATP was context specific for each of the drugs or combinations thereof, with and without methamphetamine or viral gp120. Loss of ATP was associated with activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and autophagy, which, however, failed to restore normal levels of neuronal ATP. In contrast, boosting autophagy with rapamycin prevented the long-term drop of ATP during exposure to cART in combination with methamphetamine or gp120. Our findings indicate that the overall positive effect of cART on HIV infection is accompanied by detectable neurotoxicity, which in turn may be aggravated by methamphetamine."
610,0.003,3.0,"The variability of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is very high. To date, three distinct lineages of HIVs, type 1 group M, type 1 group O and type 2 are described, suggesting at least three different zoonotic infections. HIV-1 group M is responsible for the global epidemic of AIDS. At least ten subtypes of HIV-1 group M, labelled A through J, have been discovered. Viral sequences from both the gag and the env gene, particularly a part of gp 120 referred to as the V3 region have been used to identify subtypes of HIV-1 group M. The nucleotide distance between viruses of different subtypes is on average 30% for the env gene. The various subtypes are geographically distributed throughout the world. Some of the subtypes were identified as recombinant or mosaic viruses. The existence of different subtypes of HIV-1 have major implication for vaccination. They may also influence the diagnosis of HIV infection. To date, it is unclear whether subtypes of HIV-1 differ with respect to transmissibility or pathogenicity."
5032,0.003,3.0,"Increasing evidence has suggested that HIV infection severely damages the Vγ2Vδ2 (Vδ2) T cells that play an important role in the first-line host response to infectious disease. However, little is known about Vδ2 T cell-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in HIV disease. We found that although the CD16(+) Vδ2 T cell subset hardly participated in phosphoantigen responses dominated by the CD16(-) Vδ2 T cell subset, the potency of the ADCC function of Vδ2 T cells was correlated with the frequency of the CD16(+) subset. Thus, two distinct and complementary Vδ2 T cell subsets discriminated by CD16 were characterized to explore the respective impacts of HIV-1 infection on them. HIV-1 disease progression was not only associated with the phosphoantigen responsiveness of the CD16(-) Vδ2 subset, but also with the ability of the CD16(+) Vδ2 subset to kill antibody-coated target cells. Furthermore, both of the two Vδ2 functional subsets could be partially restored in HIV-infected patients with antiretroviral therapy. Notably, in the context of an overall HIV-mediated Vδ2 T cell depletion, despite the decline of phosphoantigen-responsive CD16(-) Vδ2 cells, CD16(+) Vδ2 cell-mediated ADCC was not compromised but exhibited a functional switch with dramatic promotion of degranulation in the early phase of HIV infection and chronic infection with slower disease progression. Our study reveals functional characterizations of the two Vδ2 T cell subsets with different activation pathways during HIV-1 infection and provides a rational direction for activating the CD16(+) Vδ2 T cells capable of mediating ADCC as a means to control HIV-1 disease."
3095,0.003,3.0,"Abstract We report the presence of drug resistance mutations in 7.4% (2/27) of the treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected children in Pune, India, who had HIV-1 RNA levels >1,000 copies/ml. Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations, namely A98G and K103N, were observed in two separate sequences. In addition, three study sequences displayed three separate HIV-1 protease minor resistance mutations-L10I, A71T, and T74S. These preliminary data from Pune, India, reporting the presence of HIVDR in treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected children, reinforces the need to conduct large-scale studies to assess the prevalence of primary HIVDR in the pediatric population, which in turn will aid in planning protocols and policies related to antiretroviral treatment for the pediatric population.

3188,0.003,3.0,"A cross-sectional study of stable monogamous couples, recruited from 16 clinical and surveillance centers in Italy between 1987 and 1992, was carried out to investigate the risk factors of woman-to-man sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The male partners of all HIV-infected women attending the centers were invited to participate in the study. Of the 275 male partners who were tested for HIV and interviewed with use of a structured questionnaire, 51 were excluded because they had other possible risk factor for HIV infection, no established risk factor was found in the index case, or they had stopped engaging in sexual intercourse. Fourteen of the 224 men (6.3%) were seropositive for HIV. At logistic regression, the highest risks of transmission were for men practicing peno-anal intercourse [odds ratio (OR), 4.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-22.2] and for men whose partner had acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or a CD4+ lymphocyte count of < or = 400/mm3. No seropositive men were observed among those who were aware of the woman's HIV seropositivity since the beginning of the relationship or were partners of a zidovudine-treated woman. The results suggest that the risk factors described in man-to-woman and man-to-man HIV sexual transmission also operate in woman-to-man transmission."
2276,0.003,3.0,"Prevalence and determinants of HIV infection were assessed in 127 homosexual and bisexual men in the northeastern part of Italy. The overall prevalence of HIV seropositivity was still rather low: 20% (95% confidence interval -CI- 13-27%). The most important risk factor for acquiring HIV infection turned out to be having has sexual intercourses in high-risk areas. Relative risks (RRs) for those who have travelled and had sex in North Europe and in the U.S., were, respectively, 2.7 (95% CI: 1.0-7.3) and 5.6 (95% CI: 1.2-25.9). A significantly increased risk was also seen for having a steady sexual partner (RR = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.3-7.5). Use of nitrite inhalants, high number of occasional sexual partners and habitual receptive anal intercourses were also associated with elevation of risk, whereas prostitution was not. The present study confirms the patterns of HIV spread among homosexual and bisexual men from high-risk areas to low-risk areas and prompts urgent educational intervention, in order to prevent the epidemics of AIDS among Italian homosexuals from reaching the size documented in other countries."
4488,0.003,3.0,"A case of a false-positive result of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) confirmatory immunoblot-based assay is described. Repeatedly borderline reactive anti-HIV screening enzyme immunoassay result obtained in a local hospital resulted in directing the sample to the Slovenian HIV/AIDS Reference Laboratory. In the Reference Laboratory, both anti-HIV screening assays and confirmatory Western blot were negative, while a confirmatory test INNO-LIA HIV I/II Score (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) was anti-HIV-1 positive due to sgp120 and gp41 reactivity. The results of serological testing of the second sample obtained three weeks later were completely identical, while in the third sample obtained 5 months later, seroreversion was observed. Due to a negative dynamics in anti-HIV serological profile and repeatedly negative results of the molecular tests for HIV-1 and HIV-2, HIV infection was excluded and the results of test INNO-LIA HIV I/II Score were finally interpreted as false positive."
4306,0.003,3.0,"Studies of the immune response to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been hampered by the antigenic diversity of the HIV envelope protein. In an effort to predict the efficacy of vaccination we have compared the systemic anti-envelope antibody response in seronegative volunteers immunized with recombinant gp160 (either in vaccinia or as soluble protein produced in baculovirus) derived from the HTLV-IIIB strain of HIV-1 and in two laboratory workers accidentally infected with the same strain. 11 of 14 vaccinees responded to immunization by producing anti-gp160 of similar titer and the same isotype as that seen in the laboratory workers. Four vaccinees also had antibody to the principal neutralizing domain (V3 loop) that was comparable in titer with that seen in the laboratory workers, but the fine specificity of anti-V3 antibody was qualitatively different in the two groups. Antibody that can block the interaction between CD4 and gp120 was present at comparable levels in three vaccines and the lab workers. Neutralizing antibody titers were markedly lower in the vaccinees than in the laboratory workers. In seven of the vaccinees, an immunodominant epitope was at amino acid 720-740. Analyses of monoclonal antibodies to this region indicate that they do not neutralize, bind to infected cells, nor function as immunotoxins. Although the anti-gp160 antibody response was of similar magnitude in both infected and vaccinated individuals, there were important qualitative differences."
3526,0.003,3.0,"In Brazil, current trends of the AIDS epidemic include an increase in transmission through heterosexual contact, predominantly from men to women, with more cases of AIDS in women and more children contaminated by vertical transmission. There is also a high proportion of cases in poor people or people living in small towns. HIV-infected patients with high levels of immunodeficiency are frequently hospitalized after their first visit to the clinic due to opportunistic infections, characteristic of advanced disease. This study characterized the clinical and laboratory pattern of AIDS in a sample of patients attended for the first time in the AIDS clinic of the Federal University of Bahia Hospital (HUPES) in Salvador, Brazil. We revised medical charts of cases of subjects registered at the outpatient AIDS clinic from January 1997 to December 2003. The demographics, clinical data, and laboratory characteristics were analyzed to determine the degree of immunodeficiency at the time of admission. A total of 377 patients were evaluated (58.6% were male, with a mean sample age of 33.4 years). The most frequent clinical manifestations were asthenia, weight loss, fever, anemia, dermatitis, oral thrush and diarrhea. CDC criteria were not adequate to define the initial cases. After admission to the outpatient clinic, nearly 25% of the patients were hospitalized immediately, indicating delay in the diagnosis. In Bahia, the initial presentation of HIV-infected patients to health care assistance is occurring at a late stage of the disease, when signs and symptoms of immunodeficiency are already established. Efforts are necessary to construct strategies to make an early diagnosis of these patients, improve the quality of care, and guarantee the benefits of antiretroviral therapy, when it is indicated."
5151,0.003,3.0,Data evaluating the biological events and determinants of early human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection are limited in sub-Saharan Africa. We examined plasma viral levels and trends during early and established HIV-1 infection among reproductive-age women who participated in a randomized trial to treat genital tract infection in Malawi. We also assessed the association of injectable hormonal contraceptive use with HIV-1 infection.
4515,0.003,3.0,"We present a case of a clinical manifest hepatitis B virus infection and a potentially misleading HBV serological profile in an HIV-1 positive patient despite previous HBV vaccination. The patient presented with an acute hepatitis B and there was no indication of chronic HBV infection or the presence of a mutation in the 'a' determinant. Remarkably, simultaneously with high HBV surface antigen and HBV viral load, high anti-HBs antibodies were present. If, due to previous HBV vaccination only anti-HBs was tested in this patient, the result of the high anti-HBs antibodies could be very misleading and offering a false sense of security. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on how to assess HBV specific immunological memory and determining the role of HBV booster vaccinations in immunocompromised individuals."
1903,0.003,3.0,"Substance abuse and addiction are highly prevalent in HIV-infected individuals. Substance abuse is an important comorbidity that affects the delivery and outcomes of HIV medical management. In this paper I will review data examining the associations between substance abuse and HIV treatment and potential strategies to improve outcomes in this population that warrant further investigation. Current - but not past - substance abuse adversely affects engagement in care, acceptance of antiretroviral therapy, adherence with therapy, and long-term persistence in care. Substance abuse treatment appears to facilitate engagement in HIV care, and access to evidence-based treatment for substance abuse is central to addressing the HIV epidemic. Strategies that show promise for HIV-infected substance abusers include integrated treatment models, directly observed therapy, and incentive-based interventions."
8714,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the infectious agent of both acute and chronic hepatitis. HBV exists in multiple genotypic variants that differ in their capacity to become persistent chronic infections and in their clinical manifestations, including hepatocellular carcinoma. The 8 genotypes (A-H) of HBV show a specific worldwide geographic distribution and are correlated with different disease course, severity, and response to therapy. We isolated DNA from 75 HBV-positive blood donors, chosen randomly from the database of the National Blood Bank in Tirana, to specifically analyze the UGT1A1 polymorphism to determine its correlations with bilirubin levels and liver function. The large number of subjects who were HBV-positive carriers of heterozygosis or homozygosis for the UGT1A1*28 (TA)7 polymorphism suggests that these individuals may be more susceptible to cancer and should follow a strict regime of prevention.

6947,0.003,3.0,"The importance of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in the progression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a subject of debate. This study sought to identify independent risk factors involved in development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly in patients with chronic HBV infection who have normal ALT values. Data from 381 consecutive hepatitis B patients were analyzed with average ALT integration values < or = 40 IU/L and follow-up periods of > 3 years. Integration values were calculated from biochemical tests, and serological markers associated with the cumulative incidence of HCC were analyzed. HCC developed in 17 of the 381 patients (4.5%) during the follow-up period. Male sex (hazard ratio, 6.011 [95% confidence interval: 1.353-26.710], P = 0.018), high HBV-DNA levels (> or = 5.0 log copies/ml; 5.125 [1.880-13.973], P = 0.001), low platelet counts (< 15.0 x 10(4)/mm(3); 4.803 [1.690-13.647], P = 0.003), and low total cholesterol levels (< 130 mg/dl; 5.983 [1.558-22.979], P = 0.009) were significantly associated with greater incidence of HCC development. High HBV-DNA levels and low platelet counts are associated with the development of HCC in patients infected with hepatitis B who have normal ALT values. Therefore, maintenance of low HBV-DNA levels is important for the prevention of HCC in patients with low platelet counts, particularly in patients whose ALT values fall within the current normal range."
2271,0.003,3.0,"HIV infection has now been consistently identified as the major cause of death in young Africans in both urban and rural areas. In Africa, several studies have defined the clinical presentation of HIV disease but there have only been a limited number of autopsy studies. Because of the scarcity of autopsy data and the possibility of differing type and frequency of opportunistic infections between different geographic locations we set out to study consecutive new adult medical admissions to a tertiary referral hospital in Nairobi and perform autopsies on a sample of HIV-1-positive and HIV-1-negative patients who died in the hospital ward. Basic demographic data were collected on all patients admitted to two acute medical wards over an 11-month period. Final outcome and final clinical diagnoses were recorded at discharge or death. An autopsy examination was requested if the patient died in the ward. Autopsy examination was performed in 75 HIV-1-positive (40 men, 35 women) and 47 HIV-1-negative (28 men, 19 women) adults who died in the hospital. This represented 48.4% of all HIV-1-positive deaths and 33.3% of all HIV-1-negative deaths. Tuberculosis (TB) and bacterial and interstitial bronchopneumonia accounted for 96% of the major pathology in patients found to be HIV-1-positive at autopsy. TB was present in half the HIV-1-positive autopsy patients and was disseminated in over 80% of cases. Meningeal involvement was present in 26% of those with disseminated TB. By contrast, TB was much less common in the HIV-1-negative patients at autopsy in whom bacterial bronchopneumonia and malignancies were the most common pathologies. The type pathology found in the HIV-1-positive autopsy patients was not different than that found in other areas in Africa so far studied."
1199,0.003,3.0,"Telbivudine is an orally bioavailable L-nucleoside with potent and specific anti-hepatitis B virus activity. The higher rate of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion during telbivudine treatment than other potent anti-HBV agents suggests a potential immunomodulatory effect. We sought to determine the effects of telbivudine on the immune system, particularly on cytokine production and T-cell response, using an animal model with mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3)-induced hepatitis. The effects of telbivudine on virus replication and cytokine production were investigated in vitro using MHV-3-infected macrophages, and the effects on T-cell response were investigated in vivo in an MHV-3-induced viral hepatitis model. Telbivudine had no effect on MHV-3 replication in macrophages. However, the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-12 was increased significantly in MHV-3-induced macrophages treated with telbivudine. In vivo survival was enhanced in telbivudine-treated mice, with marked normalization in clinical conditions and histological lesions. Serum levels of interferon-gamma were elevated significantly after telbivudine treatment in MHV-3-infected C3H mice. In contrast, serum interleukin-4 levels were decreased significantly. Furthermore, telbivudine treatment enhanced the ability of T cells to undergo proliferation and secrete cytokines but did not affect cytotoxicity of infected hepatocytes. Of note, we found that telbivudine treatment suppressed programmed death ligand 1 expression on T cells. The results demonstrate the immunomodulatory properties of telbivudine, independent of its antiviral activity, in a mouse model of MHV-3-induced hepatitis."
7852,0.003,3.0,"3'-Azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) is extensively used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Currently, it is debated whether AZT should be offered to symptomless HIV-infected individuals in the hope of delaying or even preventing progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, before the chronic use of AZT, it is essential to establish whether this drug alters the differentiation and functions of T cells particularly because HIV infects CD4+ T cells, as well as investigate whether AZT would alter the T cell response to HIV-encoded antigens. In the current study, therefore, we investigated the effect of administration of AZT into mice for 7-14 days on T cell differentiation in the thymus and the ability of T cells to respond to HIV antigens in the periphery. Our data demonstrated that AZT, when administered orally at 500 mg/kg body wt or higher concentrations for 14 days, caused marked thymic involution with significant decrease in the percentage of CD4+CD8+ T cells and increase in the percentage of CD4-CD8-, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells. AZT treatment did not affect the cellularity of the spleen or the ratios of T cells in the periphery. Also, splenic T cells from AZT-treated mice did not demonstrate marked decrease in their ability to respond to mitogens in vitro. However, when AZT-treated mice were immunized with foreign antigens, such as gp120 of HIV or conalbumin, the T cells demonstrated significant decrease in their ability to respond to these antigens. When AZT was added to cultures, it was found to inhibit the proliferation of T cells to mitogens as well as the differentiation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Interestingly, addition of exogenous IL-2 to CTL cultures reconstituted the decreased CTL response. Furthermore, administration of IL-2 into AZT-treated mice could also reconstitute the decrease in thymic cellularity induced by AZT. These data indicate that AZT, when present at the time of T cell differentiation or responsiveness to antigens in vivo, can mediate significant inhibition of such functions thereby suggesting that AZT may affect the immune response to HIV antigens."

4569,0.003,3.0,"CD4-positive membrane vesicles (MV) were isolated under isotonic conditions from human T lymphoblastoid cells MT-2 and CEM and tested for their ability to support reverse transcription of viral RNA upon exposure to human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1). MV contained cytoplasms as confirmed by the presence of mitochondrial DNA but were devoid of chromosomal DNA. Virus binding and vesicle lysis assays revealed that 4-19% (depending upon virus dose) of MV-bound HIV-1 entered the vesicles. HIV-1 internalized in MV was able to initiate and complete viral DNA synthesis as determined by the detection of products of reverse transcription using polymerase chain reaction amplification of viral DNA using regions present in early (strong stop) transcripts and full-length double-stranded molecules. Viral DNA was undetectable in MV exposed to HIV-1 at 0 degrees C, in MV exposed to UV-inactivated virus at 37 degrees C, or after exposure to intact virus at 37 degrees C in the presence of reverse transcriptase inhibitors 2',3'-dideoxycytidine and a tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk](1,4)-benzodiazepin-2-(1H)-thione derivative, indicating that viral DNA detected in HIV-1-exposed MV was synthesized de novo. Kinetic studies revealed that HIV-1 DNA synthesis in MV was very rapid; full-length viral DNA was detected within 15 min of exposure at 37 degrees C, and the DNA levels increased 90-fold after 1 h and declined thereafter. Strong stop viral DNA was 10-fold more abundant than full-length DNA after 1 h at 37 degrees C, indicating that 10% of input viral genomes are fully transcribed in MV within this time frame. This system preserves the critical features of intact CD4-bearing cells to permit studies of HIV-1 entry, uncoating, and reverse transcription of viral RNA."
1477,0.003,3.0,"Few studies have surveyed HIV-infected patients to determine how adequately medical, legal, psychological, social service, and financial needs are being met through current treatment services. Fifty HIV-infected men seen at a county medical facility were surveyed to determine which of 17 needs were being met and the importance rating attributed to those needs. Five needs were reported by more than 30% of the sample as not being met: 1) being able to talk about fears of the future, illness, or death; 2) being occupied and having things to do; 3) having up-to-date information about HIV; 4) having someone to help them with their feelings of depression, helplessness, anxiety, or anger; and 5) help for the patient's family. Three of these five needs involve better access to psychological services. Although patients felt they had knowledgeable medical staff and good health care, they wanted more up-to-date information on HIV treatment."
193,0.003,3.0,"To determine the types and rates of tumors which may be associated with HIV infection in women, we used cancer incidence data from New York and northern New Jersey. We examined changes in incidence of selected cancers in women aged 20-49 years and compared groups differing in incidence of AIDS. Black women were compared to white women in New York City and in the remainder of New York State; for cervical cancer, rates were also compared for Blacks and Whites in northern New Jersey. The incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in women increased in New York City, beginning in 1982 for Blacks and in 1984 for Whites, but remained stable in the remainder of New York State. The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in New York women doubled in Blacks after 1982 whereas incidence trends in Whites were unchanged. No consistent variation was seen in the incidence of Hodgkin's disease. Cervical cancer in New York and northern New Jersey Blacks declined over the same period by approximately 40% for invasive tumors and 50% for in situ lesions. The HIV epidemic is associated with substantial excesses of Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in women. The absence of Kaposi's sarcoma in upstate New York women suggests the existence of a geographically restricted co-factor(s) for Kaposi's sarcoma in addition to HIV. If HIV affected cervical cancer incidence through 1988, its impact was small compared to the striking decreases which followed widespread adoption of Papanicolaou screening."
1822,0.003,3.0,"This cross-sectional study of 341 entrants to drug abuse treatment in four Connecticut cities in 1986-1987 evaluated whether demographic, behavioral, viral serologic, or economic differences explained the disproportionate risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection among black and Hispanic intravenous drug users (IVDUs), relative to non-Hispanic white IVDUs. Blacks [odds ratio (OR) = 9.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.1-15.9] and Hispanics (OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.9-8.8) were at increased risk of HIV-1 infection, relative to non-Hispanic whites. Those who lived closer to New York City, injected drugs more frequently, used intravenous drugs for a longer duration, used shooting galleries, had greater numbers of sexual partners, had human cytomegalovirus (CMV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies, and had the lowest annual incomes were also at increased risk. However, none of these other factors accounted for the black and Hispanic HIV-1 risk in stratified analysis. Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, proximity to New York City, and number of drug injections in the past year each also remained significant, independent risk factors in a multivariate analysis. The increased HIV-1 risk of nonwhite IVDUs remained unexplained. Behavioral, sociologic, and/or biologic factors not identified in this study may modulate HIV-1 transmission dynamics in IVDUs."

1583,0.003,3.0,"Neuronal damage in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in the brain is thought to occur at least in part through NMDA receptor (NMDAR) excitation initiated by soluble neurotoxins from HIV-infected brain macrophages. Furthermore, brain regions enriched in NMDAR-2A (NR2A) and NMDAR-2B (NR2B) subunits, such as the hippocampus, are particularly vulnerable. Using cultured rat hippocampal cells and HIV-1-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (HIV/MDM), we examined the role of NR2A and NR2B in HIV/MDM-induced hippocampal neuronal death. We used the primary HIV-1 strain Jago derived from the CSF of an individual with HIV-associated dementia and that robustly replicates in MDM. We found the following: (1) hippocampal neuronal susceptibility to HIV/MDM excitotoxins varies according to the developmental expression patterns of NR2A and NR2B; (2) NMDAR activation by HIV/MDM results in neuronal calpain activation, which results in neuronal death; and (3) selective antagonists of homomeric NR2B/NR2B- and heteromeric NR2A/NR2B-containing NMDARs, as well as an inhibitor of calpain activity, afford neuroprotection against HIV/MDM. These studies establish a clear link between macrophage HIV infection, neuronal NR2A and NR2B activation, and calpain-mediated hippocampal neuronal death. They further suggest a dominant role for NR2A and NR2B in determining neuronal susceptibility in HIV-infected brain. Antagonists of NR2A and NR2B subunits as well as inhibitors of calpain activation offer attractive neuroprotective approaches against HIV in both developing and mature brain."
5827,0.003,3.0,"A patient with HIV infection who experienced immune reconstitution after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [increase in CD4 T cell count from <1/microl to >600/microl] presented with severe Graves' disease 32 months after commencing HAART. A comprehensive clinical and laboratory study demonstrated pronounced regional lymphadenopathy and thymic enlargement at presentation, and that the onset of thyrotropin receptor antibody production was associated with increased production of soluble CD30 (a marker of type 2 immune responses). Blood naive CD8 T cell counts and TREC levels in both CD4 and CD8 T cells were increased at multiple time points compared with carefully selected controls. We conclude that the Graves' disease in this patient was associated with abnormally high blood counts of thymus-derived T cells, and propose that Graves' disease after HAART in this and other HIV patients may result from failure to delete autoreactive T cell clones in the regenerating thymus."
5781,0.003,3.0,"This paper examines utilization of paid and unpaid home health care using data from a nationally representative sample of HIV-positive persons receiving medical care in early 1996 (N = 2,864). Overall, 21.0% used any home care, 12.2% used paid care and 13.6% used unpaid care. Most (70.0%) users of home care received care from only one type of provider. Substantially more hours of unpaid than paid care were used. We also found evidence of a strong association between type of service used and type of care provider: 62.4% of persons who used nursing services only received paid care only; conversely, 55.5% of persons who used personal care services only received care only from unpaid caregivers. Use of home care overall was concentrated among persons with AIDS: 39.5% of persons with AIDS received any home health care, compared to 9.5% of those at earlier disease stages. In addition to having an AIDS diagnosis, logistic regression analyses indicated that other need variables significantly increased utilization; a higher number of HIV-related symptoms, lower physical functioning, less energy, a diagnosis of CMV and a recent hospitalization each independently increased the odds of overall home care utilization. Sociodemographic variables had generally weak relationships with overall home care utilization. Among users of home care, non-need variables had more influence on use of paid than unpaid care. Both paid and unpaid home health care is a key component of community-based systems of care for people with HIV infection. The results presented in this paper are the first nationally representative estimates of home care utilization by persons with HIV/AIDS and are discussed with reference to policy and future research."
8118,0.003,3.0,"Invasive pneumococcal disease (PD) occurs frequently among HIV-infected patients, but it is unclear whether its manifestations and outcome are different compared to those observed among patients without HIV-1 infection. Because the immune reconstitution that accompanies antiretroviral therapy may change some of these features and because most cases of HIV- 1 infection occur in resource-poor settings of the world where access to antiretroviral agents is limited, we compared PD among patients with and without HIV-1 infection in a North American population before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The records of all pneumococcal cultures processed at this medical center over a period of 20 months were used to identify patients with invasive PD. Hospital records were reviewed for 103 of these patients (52 with and 51 without HIV-1 infection) and demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and microbiologic information was abstracted and subsequently analyzed. Despite similarities in presenting signs and symptoms, we found a higher incidence of bacteremia but a more favorable outcome with less frequent requirements for intubation and admission to intensive care units and better survival among individuals with HIV infection. Factors such as less advanced age, the presence of fewer comorbid conditions, or a less florid inflammatory response among HIV-infected individuals may account for differences in outcome of invasive PD."
3023,0.003,3.0,"We report a patient with Japanese minor β thalassemia and HIV-1 infection. The patient showed prolonged anemia, which was originally attributed to chronic parvovirus B19 infection. Twelve years later, the patient presented with exacerbation of microcytic anemia following cessation of anti-retroviral therapy; the exacerbation resolved when anti-retroviral therapy was resumed. Sequencing of the β globin gene revealed heterozygosity for a four-nucleotides deletion at codon 41/42 and minor β thalassemia was confirmed. Because HIV-1-infected patients frequently show anemia due to nutritional deficiencies, opportunistic infections, AIDS-related malignancies, drug treatment and a direct effect of HIV-1 on the bone marrow, it is likely to overlook other causes of anemia. Thalassemia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of anemia even in HIV-1 infected patients, when microcytic anemia without iron deficiency is observed. Our case suggested that active HIV infection may have worsened β thalassemia, and early introduction of anti-retroviral therapy is beneficial for the recovery of anemia."
4756,0.003,3.0,"A number of hematologic abnormalities, including cytopenias, have been observed in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. To elucidate their mechanisms, primitive cells from bone marrow aspirates of 21 patients with HIV-1 infection were quantitated by flow cytometry. The mean percentage of CD34+ cells is not significantly altered in HIV-1-infected patients in comparison with HIV-1-seronegative controls. In contrast, two- and three-color immunofluorescence analysis showed that in all HIV-1 samples, most CD34+ cells coexpressed the CD38 antigen. The proportion of HIV-1-derived CD34+ cells that did not express the CD38 antigen was significantly lower (HIV-1+: mean, 1.73%; controls: mean, 14%; P < .0005) than in controls. Moreover, of Thy-1+ cells, the proportion of CD34+ cells was twofold lower in HIV-1-infected patients (HIV-1+: mean, 12%; controls, 25%, P < .0005), which suggests that phenotypically primitive cells are depleted in HIV-1 infection. In vitro functional analysis in long-term cultures of sorted CD34+ cells from seven HIV-1 patients showed that CD34+ cells from HIV-1 patients generated much fewer colonies both in the nonadherent and adherent layers than CD34+ cells from controls after 5 weeks of culture (10-fold and four-fold less, respectively). Precise long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC) frequency in the CD34+ cell population was determined in three patients by limiting dilution and was markedly decreased in comparison to that of normal controls (from twofold to > sevenfold decreased). To determine if primitive cells were infected by HIV-1, both methylcellulose colonies generated from long-term culture of CD34+ cells and various CD34+ cell fractions purified by flow cytometry were evaluated for the presence of HIV-1 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Progeny from long-term culture was HIV-1-negative in three samples. In addition, using a sensitive PCR technique, the HIV-1 genome could not be detected in CD34+, CD34+/CD38-, and CD34+/CD4+ cells. These data show that hematologic disorders in HIV disease may be the consequence of a deficit of primitive cells. However, direct infection of these cells by HIV-1 does not seem to be responsible for this defect."
3338,0.003,3.0,"We assessed the factors that influenced improvement or progression in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who were receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). This was a retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected patients receiving cART in Taizhou, Zhejiang, China, 2009-2015. Liver fibrosis was assessed by Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score. Improvement of liver fibrosis was defined as having > 30% decrease in FIB-4 from baseline, whereas progression of liver fibrosis was defined as having > 30% increase in FIB-4 score from baseline. A total of 955 HIV-infected patients were included. Of these, 808 (84.6%) were HIV-monoinfection, 125 (13.1%) were HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection and 29 (3.0%) were HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. The median duration of treatment was 15 months. After treatment, 37.1% participants had > 30% decreases in FIB-4 index, 14.8% had > 30% increases in FIB-4 index, while the remaining 48.2% had stabilized FIB-4 index. In multivariate analysis, improvement of liver fibrosis was negatively associated with an older age, but was positively associated with baseline FIB-4 index and > 30% increases in CD4 cell count after ART. Progression of liver fibrosis was positively associated with an older age, but was negatively associated with gender and HIV transmission mode (male homosexual vs. male heterosexual, female heterosexual vs. male heterosexual), and baseline FIB-4 index. Our findings indicate that improvement of liver fibrosis could be achieved by early initiation of ART through better CD4 cell recovery. Liver fibrosis and hepatotoxicity associated with ART should be monitored as early as possible and throughout till the end of treatment, with special attention to the elderly and heterosexual men."
8789,0.003,3.0,"Because of neurocognitive impairments in perinatally human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children and adolescents, this study aimed to demonstrate the effect of plasma viral loads and early initiation of sufficient combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) on neurocognitive development.In total, 14 perinatally infected HIV-positive children (median age 8.24 years [range: 6.0-16.74]) receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based ART underwent neurocognitive testing using the Wechsler Intelligence Score for Children, 4th Edition (WISC-IV). All 14 patients participated in a pharmacokinetic study in which they were hospitalized for an entire day. As a child's ability to concentrate varies over the course of the day, all tests were performed in the morning.The patients' neurocognitive development did not significantly differ from the normative collective pattern for any of the following composite scores that were examined: full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) (mean: 106.5, P = .1060), verbal comprehension index (mean: 106.0, P = .1356), perceptual reasoning index (mean: 106.0, P = .1357), working memory index (mean: 106.3, P = .1171), and processing speed index (mean: 98.1, P = .6313). The overall full-scale IQ scores were significantly higher in children who began ART within the first year of life (P = .0379), whereas low lopinavir/r plasma levels (P = .0070) and high viral load area under the curves (AUCs) in the first 3 years of life, but not later, significantly correlated with reduced neurocognitive performance (Spearman r = -0.64, P = .0278).In this cohort of cART treated HIV-positive children and adolescents, neurocognitive performance correlated with early and sufficient viral load suppression within the first 3 years of life."
1663,0.003,3.0,"The performance characteristics of an enhanced-sensitivity branched-DNA assay (bDNA) (Quantiplex HIV-1 version 2.0; Chiron Corp., Emeryville, Calif.) and a reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay (AMPLICOR HIV-1 Monitor; Roche Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Branchburg, N.J.) were compared in a molecular diagnostic laboratory. Samples used in this evaluation included linearity and reproducibility panels made by dilution of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) stock culture of known virus particle count in HIV-1-negative plasma, a subtype panel consisting of HIV-1 subtypes A through F at a standardized level, and 64 baseline plasma specimens from HIV-1-infected individuals. Plots of log10 HIV RNA copies per milliliter versus log10 nominal virus particles per milliliter demonstrated that both assays were linear over the stated dynamic ranges (bDNA, r = 0.98; RT-PCR, r = 0.99), but comparison of the slopes of the regression lines (bDNA, m = 0.96; RT-PCR, m = 0.83) suggested that RT-PCR had greater proportional systematic error. The between-run coefficients of variation for bDNA and RT-PCR were 24.3 and 34.3%, respectively, for a sample containing 1,650 nominal virus particles/ml and 44.0 and 42.7%, respectively, for a sample containing 165 nominal virus particles/ml. Subtypes B, C, and D were quantitated with similar efficiencies by bDNA and RT-PCR; however, RT-PCR was less efficient in quantitating subtypes A, E, and F. One non-B subtype was recognized in our clinical specimens based on the ratio of values obtained with the two methods. HIV-1 RNA was quantitated in 53 (83%) baseline plasma specimens by bDNA and in 55 (86%) specimens by RT-PCR. RT-PCR values were consistently greater than bDNA values, with population means of 142,419 and 67,580 copies/ml, respectively (P < 0.01). The results were highly correlated (r = 0.91), but the agreement was poor (mean difference in log10 copies per milliliter +/- 2 standard deviations, 0.45 +/- 0.61) for the 50 clinical specimens that gave discrete values with both methods."
3808,0.003,3.0,"Where men have had access to successful treatment for HIV (highly active antiretroviral therapy), expectations of both patients and physicians alike have changed significantly over the past decade. Such men, living with HIV, expect to lead fully functional lives including a normal sex life. Sexual dysfunction is well described among men with HIV. We retrospectively analysed details of 190 consecutive men attending a dedicated sexual dysfunction service in our HIV unit over an 18-month period. We took note of the specifics of their HIV disease, illnesses other than HIV, as well as other risk factors associated with sexual dysfunction. Men with sexual dysfunction all commonly reported recreational drug use, hepatitis B and C co-infection, anxiety and depressive illnesses, peripheral neuropathy and lipodystrophy. There was a significant relationship between men complaining of retarded ejaculation and peripheral neuropathy. Sexual dysfunction in non-HIV settings is known to lead to poor adherence to prescribed medications, e.g. antihypertensive agents. Iatrogenic sexual dysfunction in patients may similarly have a potential to lead to poor antiretroviral compliance if not addressed."
458,0.003,3.0,"Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is known to increase the risk of death from severe liver disease and, because HCV status is strongly associated with a history of injecting drug use, the effect of a key disease progression cofactor, infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is of interest. We examined all-cause, liver-related and drug-related mortality and excess risk of death from these causes in a large cohort of HCV-monoinfected and HIV-coinfected persons in Scotland. The study population consisted of 20,163 persons confirmed to be infected with hepatitis C through laboratory testing in Scotland between 1991 and 2005. Records with sufficient identifiers were linked to the General Register Office for Scotland death register to retrieve associated mortality data, and were further linked to a national database of HIV-positive individuals to determine coinfection status. A total of 1715 HCV monoinfected and 305 HIV coinfected persons died of any cause during the follow-up period (mean of 5.4 and 6.4 years, respectively). Significant excess mortality was observed in both HCV monoinfected and HIV coinfected populations from liver-related underlying causes (standardised mortality ratios of 25, 95% CI = 23-27; and 37, 95% CI = 26-52 for the two groups, respectively) and drug-related causes (25, 95% CI = 23-27; 39, 95% CI = 28-53. The risk of death from hepatocellular carcinoma, alcoholic or non-alcoholic liver disease, or from a drug-related cause, was greatly increased compared with the general Scottish population, with the highest standardised mortality ratio observed for hepatocellular carcinoma in the monoinfected group (70, 95% CI = 57-85). This study has revealed considerable excess mortality from liver- and drug-related causes in the Scottish HCV-diagnosed population; these data are crucial to inform on the clinical management, and projected future public health burden, of HCV infection."
5876,0.003,3.0,"Many physicians, dentists, and allied health personnel sustain occupational exposures to blood and other body fluids that increase their risk of contracting type B viral hepatitis. Overall, the risk of hepatitis B among persons employed in health-related fields is estimated to be approximately four times that in the general adult population. Studies on the incidence of infection and the prevalence of hepatitis B serologic markers have further defined risk in specific occupational categories and work activities. Physicians and dentists are five to ten times more likely than the general adult population to experience hepatitis B infection. Infection rates ten or more times above the average have often been characteristic of surgeons, patient care personnel in dialysis units and institutions for the mentally handicapped, and clinical laboratory workers having frequent contact with blood samples."
8913,0.003,3.0,"To assess the prevalence of major drug resistance mutations in antiretroviral (ARV)-treated patients with detectable viral load (VL) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, genotypic resistance testing was performed among treated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) patients attending the University Malaya Medical Center between July 2003 and November 2004. The reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes from 36 plasma samples with detectable VL were examined for major mutations associated with ARV resistance as reported by the International AIDS Society-USA Drug Resistance Mutations Group. The prevalence of patients with at least one major mutation conferring drug resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), non-NRTIs (NNRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs) was 77.8%. In the RT gene, the frequency of mutations associated with NRTIs and NNRTIs resistance was 52.8 and 63.9%, respectively, with M184V and K103N mutations being selected most frequently by these drugs. A patient with Q151M mutation complex was also detected. Twenty-two percent of the patients had mutations associated with PIs. The following pattern of prevalence of ARV-resistant HIV-1 variants was observed: NNRTI-resistant > NRTI-resistant > PI-resistant. The prevalence of major drug resistance mutations among ARV-treated patients with detectable VL is high in Kuala Lumpur. Genotypic drug resistance testing is therefore important for monitoring patients experiencing ARV regimen failure."
6991,0.003,3.0,"The spectrum of complications emerging in successfully treated HIV-infected patients has dramatically changed since the advent of HAART. Typical AIDS-defining illnesses have been substituted by new comorbid conditions that threaten even those patients who maintain virologic suppression. Proper management of cardiovascular risk, and early diagnosis of AIDS-related and, particularly, non-AIDS-related malignancies (including papilomavirus-related neoplasms) must be introduced into the routine of care. Hot areas of investigation include HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, hepatitis B and C coinfection, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and tuberculosis. Bone and kidney long-term toxicities and lipoatrophy remain as issues of paramount importance. The identification and early treatment of immune reconstitution disease is also of major interest, specially in those patients starting their antiretroviral treatment with severe CD4 cell depletion. The present review focuses on these twelve areas of increasing interest for physicians currently facing successfully treated HIV+ patients."
6815,0.003,3.0,"This study aims to determine the relationship among cerebral metabolite concentrations (on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy or (1)H MRS), cognitive function, and clinical variables (CD4, plasma and CSF viral loads, and lipids) in antiretroviral medication-nai;ve HIV patients. We hypothesized that the probable glial markers myo-inositol [MI] and choline compounds [CHO] would correlate with cognitive function, CD4 count, and viral loads, but not with serum lipids. Forty-five antiretroviral-drug-nai;ve HIV patients and 25 control subjects were evaluated. Frontal lobe [MI], [CHO], and total creatine [CR] were elevated, while basal ganglia [CR] were decreased, with increasing dementia severity. As a group, HIV patients showed slowing on fine motor (Grooved Pegboard) and psychomotor function (Trails A & B), and deficits on executive function (Stroop tasks). Lower CD4 counts and elevated plasma viral loads were associated with elevated frontal white matter [MI], which in turn correlated with the Stroop tasks. These findings suggest that systemic factors (resulting from suppressed immune function and higher plasma viral load) may lead to glial proliferation (elevated [MI], [CHO], and [CR]) in the frontal white matter, which in turn may contribute to deficits on executive function in HIV. Studying antiretroviral-nai;ve patients minimized the confounding effects of antiretroviral treatment on the clinical, MRS, and neuropsychological variables, and allowed for a more accurate assessment of the relationships among these measurements. Metabolite concentrations, rather than metabolite ratios, should be measured since [CR], a commonly used reference for metabolite ratios, varies with disease severity in both frontal lobe and basal ganglia."
7565,0.003,3.0,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most dangerous malignancies with an increasing incidence and a high mortality rate, represents a major international health problem. HCC progression is known to involve genome-wide alteration of epigenetic modifications, leading to aberrant gene expression patterns. The activity of CYP2C19, an important member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, was reported to be compromised in HCC, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To understand whether epigenetic modification in HCC is associated with a change in CYP2C19 activity, we evaluated the expression levels of CYP2C19 and its transcription factors by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using mRNA extracted from both primary hepatocytes and paired tumor versus nontumor liver tissues of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). DNA methylation was examined by bisulfite sequencing and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Our results indicated that CYP2C19 could be regulated by e-box methylation of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Decreased CYP2C19 expression in tumorous tissues of HBV-infected patients with HCC was highly correlated with suppressed expression and promoter hypermethylation of CAR. Our study demonstrates that aberrant CAR methylation is involved in CYP2C19 regulation in HBV-related HCC and may play a role in liver tumorigenesis."
8668,0.003,3.0,"To compare the seroprevalence of and risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) among patients attending a public sexually transmitted disease clinic, the authors conducted both voluntary and blinded seroprevalence surveys between June 1989 and August 1990. For the voluntary survey, every twenty-fifth patient attending the clinic for a new problem was invited to receive anonymous testing for HIV antibody. For the blinded survey, sera obtained for syphilis serologies from 2,297 (86%) of the 2,682 patients attending the clinic for a new problem were tested for HIV antibody after all personal identifiers were removed. Of the 946 eligible patients, 631 (66.7%) agreed to participate in the voluntary survey. Black men were significantly less likely to participate than other men and women (p < 0.0001). The prevalence of HIV antibody was 25% greater in the blinded survey than in the voluntary survey (15.2% and 11.4%, respectively, p < 0.05). This difference was due primarily to black homosexual/bisexual men, who had a 12.7-fold greater risk of HIV infection in the blinded survey than in the voluntary survey. These results suggest that blinded seroprevalence surveys may provide a better prevalence estimate of HIV infection than voluntary surveys. The greater risk for HIV infection observed among homosexual and bisexual black men, who were tested only in the blinded serosurvey, suggests that efforts to increase voluntary testing for HIV infection in this group should be developed."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the Health Enlightenment, Awareness and Living Intervention, designed to decrease HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and related risky behaviors. The thirteen-session intervention was implemented among homeless and formerly incarcerated low-income African American women, ages 18 to 55, in Atlanta, Georgia from 2006 to 2010. A single group repeated measures study design was employed and consisted of a pre-test (n = 355) group, an immediate post-test (n = 228) group with a response rate of 64%, and a six-month follow up (n = 110) group with response rate of 48%, completing a 135-item survey. Paired-sample t-tests, McNemar tests, and repeated measures ANOVA were applied to compare survey results. Participants demonstrated statistically significant increases in hepatitis B and C knowledge over time (p < 0.001). Statistically significant decreases were also reported for unprotected sex in exchange for money, drugs or shelter (p = 0.008), and sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol (p < 0.001). Reported substance use decreased with statistical significance for alcohol (p = 0.011), marijuana (p = 0.011), illegal drugs (p = 0.002), and crack/cocaine (p = 0.003). Findings broaden the evidence base related to the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis risk reduction interventions designed for homeless and previously incarcerated African American women."
4380,0.003,3.0,"Data from a continuing multiyear seroprevalence survey of human T-lymphotropic virus types I or II (HTLV-I/II) among intravenous drug users in seven U.S. locations were analyzed to detect demographic patterns of seropositivity and coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Seropositivity for HTLV-I/II and HIV-1 was detected by whole-virus enzyme immunoassay, with Western blot confirmation. Of 1,800 subjects recruited from methadone maintenance and detoxification clinics, 207 (11.5%) were infected with HTLV-I/II. Seropositivity for HTLV-I/II varied by racial group, age, sex, and geographic location. Blacks had a higher (age- and location-adjusted) infection rate (17.1%) than Hispanics (8.7%) or whites (5.6%), and seropositivity showed a strong gradient with increasing age. Females had a slightly higher rate (14.0%) than males (10.0%), after adjustment for age and location. Among the seven locations, the rate varied from approximately 1% (Miami and Baltimore) to 20% (Los Angeles), although the former rates were based on relatively few subjects (47 and 65, respectively). Overall, the occurrence of coinfection by HIV-1 and HTLV-I/II did not occur more frequently than expected by chance."
1680,0.003,3.0,"We analyzed serum 25(OH) cholecalciferol [25(OH)D] levels and factors related to deficiency (<20 ng/ml) or insufficiency (<30 ng/ml) in a cohort of Spanish HIV-infected patients and compared them with an age- and latitude-matched population from another study. We prospectively assessed 25(OH)D deficiency/insufficiency in a cohort of 352 HIV patients during 2009-2010. Predisposing factors were recorded and their relationship to low levels was assessed by logistic regression; a nutritional survey examined intake, nutritional status, and sunlight exposure in a subgroup of 92 patients. We studied the correlation of 25(OH)D with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-adjusted vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml) was 44.0% (95% CI, 38.8-49.4%) and insufficiency (<30 ng/ml) was 71.6% (95% CI, 66.9-76.3). Deficiency was 16.4% more prevalent in our sample than in non-HIV-infected Spaniards. Lower sunlight exposure was the only factor related to lower levels in the lifestyle and nutritional survey (p=0.045). In multiple logistic regression, higher body mass index (BMI), black race/ethnicity, lower seasonal sunlight exposure, men who have sex with men (MSM), and heterosexual transmission categories, efavirenz exposure and lack of HIV viral suppression were independently associated with deficiency/insufficiency. These variables predicted 79% of cases [AUC=0.872 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91)]. Patients receiving protease inhibitors (PIs) [OR 4.0 (95% CI, 1.3-12.3); p=0.014] or NNRTI [OR 3.6 (95% CI, 1.7-11.2); p=0.025] had higher odds of increased PTH levels; this was significant only in 25(OH)D-deficient patients (p=0.004). As in less insolated areas, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was high in HIV-infected patients in Spain; among treated patients, levels were higher with PIs than with efavirenz."
3523,0.003,3.0,"Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) has infected human beings for thousands of years, but knowledge about the infection and its pathogenesis is only recently emerging. The virus can be transmitted from mother to child, through sexual contact, and through contaminated blood products. There are areas in Japan, sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and South America where more than 1% of the general population is infected. Although the majority of HTLV-1 carriers remain asymptomatic, the virus is associated with severe diseases that can be subdivided into three categories: neoplastic diseases (adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma), inflammatory syndromes (HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and uveitis among others), and opportunistic infections (including Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection and others). The understanding of the interaction between virus and host response has improved markedly, but there are still no clear surrogate markers for prognosis and there are few treatment options."
2217,0.003,3.0,"A variety of HIV-induced lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) have been described, including HIV encephalitis, HIV leukoencephalopathy, axonal damage, and diffuse poliodystrophy with neuronal loss of variable severity resulting, at least partly, from an apoptotic process. However, no correlation could be established between these changes and HIV dementia (HIVD). From our study of HIV infected patients, it appeared that neuronal apoptosis is probably not related to a single cause. Microglial and glial activation, directly or indirectly related to HIV infection, plays a major role in neuronal apoptosis possibly through the mediation of oxidative stress. In our patients with full-blown AIDS, this mechanism predominated in the basal ganglia and correlated well with HIVD. Axonal damage, either secondary to microglial activation, or to systemic factors also contributes to neuronal apoptosis. Although massive neuronal loss may be responsible for HIVD in occasional cases, we conclude that neuronal apoptosis is a late event and does not represent the main pathological substrate of HIVD. The dementia more likely reflects a specific neuronal dysfunction resulting from the combined effects of several mechanisms, some of which may be reversible. Introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy dramatically improved patient survival, however, its impact on the incidence and course of HIVD remains debatable. In our series, the incidence of HIVE has dramatically decreased since the introduction of multitherapies, but a number of cases remain whose cognitive disorders persist, despite HAART. The poor CNS penetration of many antiretroviral agents is a possible explanation, but irreversible ""burnt out"" HIV-induced CNS changes may also be responsible."
7202,0.003,3.0,"Directly addressing HIV medication adherence and substance use together is ideal in light of the research on the complex connections between these two behaviors. This paper describes the development of a pilot program in which a combined motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy intervention was used to increase adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and reduce substance use in HIV-infected adults. The main goals of the pilot study were (1) to confirm the ability to recruit HIV-positive substance users taking HAART; (2) to demonstrate the ability to retain participants over the course of an eight-session intervention; and (3) to examine changes in substance use and HAART adherence from pretreatment to posttreatment. Twelve HIV-positive adults with a substance use disorder participated in an 8-week intervention, which consisted of weekly individual sessions with a trained therapist. Results showed that despite the small sample size, there was a significant reduction in substance use from pretreatment to posttreatment. No statistically significant differences were found for changes in HIV medication adherence, but the trends suggest the potential for positive results with a larger sample. Retention for all eight sessions of the treatment was 73.3%. Eighty percent completed the 3-month follow-up assessment. Participants reported high therapeutic alliance reflecting comfort with their therapists and in the treatment. Overall, the pilot demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the treatment. Furthermore, results suggest that this may, in fact, be an effective intervention to reduce substance use and improve HIV medication adherence."

Additionally, it aimed to evaluate the correlation among densities of these cells with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and viral load levels in HIV+ subjects, all using Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). The samples were allocated into four groups: 1) 15 subjects with moderate chronic periodontitis (MCP), HIV+; 2) 15 subjects with MCP, HIV-; 3) 10 subjects with gingivitis (G), HIV+; and 4) 10 subjects with G, HIV-. The S100+ cells were assessed in the pocket epithelium, gingival epithelium, and lamina propria. A statistically significant increase of total S100+ cells in HIV+ periodontitis subjects was observed in relation to HIV- periodontitis subjects. No increase of S100+ cells with increased inflammation was observed. No statistically significant correlation among S100+ cells and blood levels of CD4, CD8, and viral load was observed. In conclusion, the use of HAART can aid in achieving viral loads, and it is suggested that it may prevent the destruction of the LC."
9382,0.003,3.0,"Several reports have recently shown that drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is often isolated from treatment-naïve patients. We phenotypically analyzed HIV-1 strains isolated from 44 treatment-naïve individuals and found two strains highly resistant (69- and >310-fold) against nevirapine (NVP). Direct sequencing showed these two isolates had a novel mutation, K238S, in reverse transcriptase (RT), but did not have any reported NVP resistance-associated mutation. A 48-h culture in the presence of NVP, however, selected HIV-1 carrying NVP resistance-associated mutations, V106A, V108I, or both, suggesting that minor viral populations of these two isolates had harbored these mutations. Replication kinetic studies of recombinant HIV-1 clones suggested that K238S conferred a significant resistance against NVP, especially when accompanied with V106A (530-fold) or V108I (56-fold). Our study identified a novel NVP resistance-associated mutation, K238S, which could be persistently detected by genotypic assay longer than V106A and V108I during off-treatment period."

No evidence of liver enzyme elevations were seen, even in 66 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection. Given that TDF is an adenosine analogue, like didanosine, exposure to ribavirin might increase intracellular phosphorylated TDF metabolites, which could result in a higher risk of nephrotoxicity. Signs of tubular dysfunction in blood or urine were not recognized in 17 HCV-HIV co-infected patients exposed to TDF during interferon plus ribavirin therapy."

A prospective study on active targeted HTC and linkage to care among MSM (≥18 years old) was conducted at a gay sauna in Thailand from November 2013 to October 2015. HIV risks and risk perception were evaluated through an anonymous survey. HIV testing with result notification and care appointment arrangement were provided on-site. Of the 358 participants; median age was 30 years; 206/358(58%) were at high risk for HIV acquisition; 148/358(41%) accepted HTC, all of whom either had prior negative HIV tests [98/148 (66%)] or had not known their HIV status [50/148 (34%)]. The three most common reasons for declining HTC were prior HIV testing within 6 months (48%), not ready (19%) and perceiving self as no risk (11%). Of the 262 moderate- and high-risk participants, 172 (66%) had false perception of low HIV risk which was significantly associated with declining HTC. Among the 148 participants undergoing HTC, 25 (17%) were HIV-infected. Having false perception of low risk (P = 0.004) and age <30 years (P = 0.02) were independently associated with HIV positivity. Only 14 of the 25 HIV-infected participants (56%) could be contacted after the result notification, of whom 12 (86%) had established HIV care and received immediate antiretroviral therapy. The active targeted HTC and facilitating care establishment was feasible among MSM attending the gay sauna but required strategies to improve accuracy of HIV-risk perception and linkage to care."

Questionnaires using face-to-face interviews were employed to collect data on sexual risk behaviors and HIV testing. Five hundred eleven MSM were recruited, of which 459 (89.8%) had anal intercourse in the past 6 months. Of these 459 participants, 457 (99.6%) answered whether they had taken an HIV test in the recent year, so only their data were analyzed. Weighted data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. The CAI rate with male partners in the past 6 months was 43.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.0-51.5%), while the rate of condomless vaginal intercourse (CVI) was 21.6% (95% CI, 15.6-32.3%). The prevalence of recent HIV testing was 56.8% (95% CI, 48.7-66.5%), while the prevalence of HIV and syphilis were 8.8% and 6.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that CAI was associated with earlier homosexual debut, suicidal inclinations, childhood sexual abuse, HIV testing in the recent year, and lower estimate of HIV prevalence. Recent HIV testing was associated with homosexual debut age, engaging in CAI with male partners in the past 6 months, having oral sex in the past 6 months, self-perceived higher likelihood of HIV infection, knowing about antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS, receiving AIDS/sexually transmitted infection (STI) interventions in the past year, and syphilis infection. Given high prevalence of HIV and syphilis, high levels of CAI and CVI, and low HIV testing rate, the results indicated high risk of HIV infection and transmission among MSM. HIV prevention interventions should target MSM with early homosexual debut and psychosocial health problems, while HIV/AIDS education among MSM should focus on increasing knowledge of HIV risk, estimated HIV prevalence and antiretroviral therapy, and improving risk perception of HIV acquisition."
2163,0.003,3.0,"We prospectively studied 1310 women with or at risk for HIV-1 infection to assess subsequent tuberculin reactions in those with > or = 10 mm induration. Forty-seven HIV-positive and 57 negative women had tuberculin reactions > or = 10 mm induration; reversions to reactions < 10 mm occurred in 44% and 46% of those retested, respectively (P = NS). Among seropositives, reversions were associated with lower CD4+ lymphocyte count (P = 0.02). Of a total of 45 subsequent tuberculin tests in seropositive women, only two (4%) resulted in 5-9 mm induration, both at CD4+ counts < 500/mm3. Three (30%) of an additional 10 seropositive women with maximal reactions of 5-9 mm induration reported prior tuberculosis exposure, a significantly lower proportion than the 36/47 (77%) with reactions > or = 10 mm induration (P < 0.01), but not different than women with maximal reaction sizes < 5 mm (219/814, 27%). This study suggests that reversions of > or = 10 mm tuberculin reactions to 5-9 mm are rare. In HIV-positive persons, especially those with CD4+ lymphocyte counts > or = 500/mm3, reaction sizes of 5-9 mm often may not indicate Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection."
7965,0.003,3.0,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are virulent intracellular pathogens that invade and multiply within macrophages. The effect of M. tuberculosis on HIV-1 infection and replication was analyzed in vitro using human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation. Preinfection of MDM with M. tuberculosis followed by HIV-1 infection resulted in an increase in p24 release, reverse transcriptase activity, and infective virus production. In contrast, no increase in HIV-1 production was observed when MDM were infected with Mycobacterium avium complex or heat-killed M. tuberculosis. Coinfected MDM were potent stimulators of T cell proliferation, while HIV-1-infected MDM failed to present exogenous tuberculin to T cells. Furthermore, coinfected MDM showed an increased capacity to transmit HIV-1 to activated T cells. These results suggest that M. tuberculosis infection can both up-regulate HIV-1 infection and replication within MDM and increase the efficiency of virus transmission from infected MDM to T cells."
7682,0.003,3.0,"Attempts to address the significant impact of HAART on medical variables on the Malaysian HIV/AIDS population have yet to be evaluated. This study aims to analyze the proportions of AIDS-defining illnesses (ADIs) before and after HAART. A retrospective study was carried out on 128 new cases of HIV infected patients who first commenced HAART in 2004 at the national HIV reference center. Before commencement of HAART, 76 clinical episodes of ADIs were recorded in 52 patients. Most common being pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (28.9%), PCP (27.6%) and disseminated and extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (11.8%). During HAART, 8 clinical episodes of ADIs were documented in 7 patients with a median time of onset of 10 weeks after initiation of HAART (range, 4-36 weeks). The median CD4 count at the time of the commencement of HAART for these patients was 11 cells/mm(3). ADIs reported include PCP (2 episodes), disseminated and extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (2 episodes), extrapulmonary cryptococcosis (1 episode), esophageal candidiasis (1 episode), recurrent pneumonia (1 episode) and disseminated or extrapulmonary histoplasmosis (1 episode). Three (37.5%) of these occurred despite a reduction of viral load by at least 2 log(10) and an increased in the CD4 cell count. In conclusion, ADIs can still present after the initiation of successful HAART especially in those with CD4 counts below 100 cells/mm(3). In Malaysia, ADIs are the major causes of HIV/AIDS associated morbidity and mortality, thus increased awareness on the management of these illnesses is warranted especially in the months following HAART."
6525,0.003,3.0,"During the routine care of patients, pulmonary and critical care specialist may have significant exposure to respiratory infections and potentially infectious body fluids such as blood and pleural fluid. Bronchoscopy and intensive care services often require close contact with patients and the use of sharp devices required for intravascular catheterization. Rendering such care places physicians at risk for acquiring agents such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis viruses, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As of December 1998, 188 cases of occupational transmission of HIV to health care workers (HCWs) in the United States have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control. Most documented cases of seroconversion involve percutaneous injury involving blood, with the greatest risks being associated with injury from a hollow-bore needle that has been in an infected patient's vein or artery. Because thousands of HIV-infected persons are unaware of their infection, HCWs must consider all patients to be infected with HIV and improve work practices accordingly. Nevertheless, elimination of all exposures is impossible, and postexposure prophylaxis with combination antiretroviral therapy is recommended for persons deemed a high risk of contracting HIV. Pulmonary specialists are at high risk of exposure to tuberculosis; proper precautions include isolation of patients with suspected tuberculosis and the use of DMF-HEPA respirator masks, especially while performing procedures like bronchoscopy. Contaminated bronchoscopes have been implicated in transmission and ""pseudoinfection"" of tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria, underscoring the need for rigorous cleaning and disinfection practices."

Asymptomatic HIV infection, 1 and 5 yr prior to the onset of lymphoma, was documented in 2 cases. 1 patient became infected by Factor VIII treatment, 2 were male homosexuals. 2 patients had an uncommon tumour presentation in the oral cavity, 1 patient presented with an abdominal mass. The histologic subtypes were immunoblastic (2), and small noncleaved cell, Burkitt's (1). Helper/suppressor T-cell ratio was decreased at onset of lymphoma in 2 cases. All 3 patients have died, 4, 6, and 24 months after diagnosis of NHL. Only 1 patient died of NHL, 1 died of an unclassified pneumonia and the third developed progressing supranuclear HIV-associated polyneuropathy without evidence of CNS lymphoma. Thus, high grade malignant B-cell NHL is a regular initial manifestation of AIDS, and may develop after years of asymptomatic HIV infection."
4094,0.003,3.0,"The objectives of this study were to build a population pharmacokinetic model that describe plasma concentrations of indinavir in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with sustained virological response under a stable antiretroviral combination, and to characterize the effect of covariates and co-medications on indinavir pharmacokinetics. Data were obtained from 45 patients who received different dosages of indinavir: either indinavir alone t.i.d. (mostly 800 mg), either indinavir b.i.d. (mostly 800 mg) with a booster dose of 100 mg of ritonavir. Patients were required to have a baseline plasma HIV RNA <200 copies/mL and to have unchanged antiretroviral treatment for 6 months. Indinavir concentrations were measured at a first visit (one sample before drug administration and five after) and at a second visit 3 months later (before and 1 or 3 h after drug administration). A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination best described indinavir pharmacokinetics. For patients treated with indinavir alone, absorption rate constant was estimated to be 0.43/h, and oral clearance Cl/F was 33 L/h. For patients treated with indinavir plus ritonavir these estimates were 0.25/h and 19 L/h, respectively. Cl/F was found to increase by 1.45-fold in men and by 1.18-fold in patients also receiving zidovudine. Oral volume of distribution (V/F) was 24 L. The inter-individual and intra-individual variability were 117 and 205% for V/F, 42 and 58% for Cl/F, respectively. This population analysis in patients with sustained virological response, quantified the effect of ritonavir on the absorption rate constant and on the clearance of indinavir, showed an increase of Cl/F in men and can be used to draw reference curve for therapeutic drug monitoring."

6023,0.003,3.0,"The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has considerably improved the quality of life and has increased the survival of HIV-infected individuals. Although HAART can successfully suppress viral replication in the long term, it is not without significant toxicity, which can seriously compromise treatment effectiveness. Moreover, the rapid rate of virus mutation and subsequent emergence of drug-resistant HIV variants threaten the longer-term efficacy of HIV treatment. The most common adverse effects caused by HAART include a metabolic syndrome with lipodystrophy, hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance, deterioration in the clinical status due to various exaggerated local and systemic inflammatory reactions during the immunerestoration disease, and various hepatic, peripheral and cardiac muscle, kidney, bone, bone marrow, retinal, ear, and skin toxicities. The heterogeneity in the organs affected by the different drugs and the morphological features observed in tissues in HAART-treated patients raise possible explanations including differential distribution or activation of these agents. Antiretroviral drugs from new classes, as well as new drugs from existing classes with favorable resistance and side effect profiles are in various stages of development. However, new tissue disorders will be certainly described in the future in patients treated with these drugs. The different pathophysiology of the main adverse effects and the less common known side effects of antiretroviral therapy against HIV are described here, with special emphasis on the histological features induced by HAART."
8750,0.003,3.0,"Organ transplantation is an acceptable option for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with end-stage kidney or liver disease. With worse outcomes on the waitlist, HIV-infected patients may actually be disproportionately affected by the organ shortage in the United States. One potential solution is the use of HIV-infected deceased donors (HIVDD), recently legalized by the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act. This is the first analysis of patient-specific data from potential HIVDD, retrospectively examining charts of HIV-infected patients dying in care at six HIV clinics in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2014. Our data suggest that there are four to five potential HIVDD dying in Philadelphia annually who might yield two to three kidneys and three to five livers for transplant. Extrapolated nationally, this would approximate 356 potential HIVDD yielding 192 kidneys and 247 livers annually. However, several donor risk indices raise concerns about the quality of kidneys that could be recovered from HIVDD as a result of older donor age and comorbidities. On the other hand, livers from these potential HIVDD are of similar quality to HIV-negative donors dying locally, although there is a high prevalence of positive hepatitis C antibody. "

7536,0.003,3.0,"We employed an RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 DNA editing system to precisely remove the entire HIV-1 genome spanning between 5' and 3' LTRs of integrated HIV-1 proviral DNA copies from latently infected human CD4+ T-cells. Comprehensive assessment of whole-genome sequencing of HIV-1 eradicated cells ruled out any off-target effects by our CRISPR/Cas9 technology that might compromise the integrity of the host genome and further showed no effect on several cell health indices including viability, cell cycle and apoptosis. Persistent co-expression of Cas9 and the specific targeting guide RNAs in HIV-1-eradicated T-cells protected them against new infection by HIV-1. Lentivirus-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 significantly diminished HIV-1 replication in infected primary CD4+ T-cell cultures and drastically reduced viral load in ex vivo culture of CD4+ T-cells obtained from HIV-1 infected patients. Thus, gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 may provide a new therapeutic path for eliminating HIV-1 DNA from CD4+ T-cells and potentially serve as a novel and effective platform toward curing AIDS. "

This was revealed through second generation surveillance conducted by HIV/AIDS Surveillance Project (HASP). While injection drug users (IDUs) were driving the epidemic, subsequent surveys showed that Hijra (transgender) sex workers (HSWs) were emerging as the second most vulnerable group with an average national prevalence of 6.4%. An exceptionally high prevalence (27.6%) was found in Larkana, which is a small town on the right bank of river Indus near the ruins of Mohenjo-Daro in the province of Sindh.

6304,0.003,3.0,"In Italy, although the most recent guidelines stress the importance of screening for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) those subjects considered to be at high risk (e.g., injecting drug users), not all drug users being treated at public drug dependency centres are regularly tested for these infections. The results of the present study show that 7.2%, 13.0%, and 7.4% of injecting drug users seeking treatment at public drug dependency centres are not tested for, respectively, HIV, HBV and HCV infections and while corresponding figures for drug users who do not inject drugs are 20.3%, 25.1% and 16.2%. The failure to undergo testing among injectors was associated with a shorter history of drug use and with drug centres in central or southern Italy; these associations were also found among non-injectors, with the addition of low level of education. The results stress the importance of facilitating access to testing, of providing the drug dependency centres with the necessary resources for taking blood samples at the centres themselves, of making access to (and performance of) testing uniform throughout the country, and of removing obstacles that can lead to the drug user's refusal to undergo testing."
4417,0.003,3.0,"Reverse transcriptase (RT) is a multifunctional enzyme in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 life cycle and represents a primary target for drug discovery efforts against HIV-1 infection. Two classes of RT inhibitors, the nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs) and the nonnucleoside transcriptase inhibitors are prominently used in the highly active antiretroviral therapy in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. However, the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viral strains has limited the successful rate of the anti-HIV agents. Computational methods are a significant part of the drug design process and indispensable to study drug resistance. In this review, recent advances in computer-aided drug design for the rational design of new compounds against HIV-1 RT using methods such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics, free energy calculations, quantitative structure-activity relationships, pharmacophore modelling and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity prediction are discussed. Successful applications of these methodologies are also highlighted. "
7128,0.003,3.0,"To investigate its use as a marker of disease severity, serum soluble CD4 (sCD4) was measured by ELISA in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Levels of sCD4 were higher in patients than in controls (P less than .001) but did not increase with disease severity. sCD4 release per CD4 lymphocyte showed a linear increase with disease severity and performed as well as beta 2-microglobulin, a widely used marker. To study the role of sCD4 in the pathogenesis of HIV infection, an ELISA to detect sCD4 complexed with glycoprotein 120 (gp120) HIV envelope protein was developed. Preformed sCD4-gp120 complexes were not detectable in patient serum, but addition of recombinant gp120 showed that circulating sCD4 is capable of binding HIV envelope proteins. This study indicates that the sCD4-to-CD4 lymphocyte ratio increases linearly with disease severity and may be a useful marker of CD4 lymphocyte damage. In addition, serum sCD4 can bind viral particles, which may have implications for the use of recombinant sCD4 as a therapy in HIV infection."
7023,0.003,3.0,"At least one-third of the 34 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide are infected with latent tuberculosis (TB). The aim of this study was to determine the rate of HIV infection in TB patients and its determinants in Wuxi City, China. TB patients attending health institutions (12 selected sites) for TB diagnosis and treatment were enrolled in this study. TB diagnosis, treatment and HIV testing were done according to the national guidelines. Blood samples were collected for anonymous HIV testing. Among the TB patients, the HIV prevalence was 13.66% (1493/10,926). Multivariate analysis showed that gender, age, education, marital status, per capita monthly income, patient residence, family size, distance from a health institution, knowledge of HIV-TB co-infection, and knowledge of HIV may be risk factors for HIV-TB co-infection (all: odds ratio > 1, p < 0.05). The prevalence of TB in those with HIV was higher among the study participants. Improving public awareness of HIV-TB co-infection, regularly screening and improving follow-up can reduce the occurrence of HIV-TB co-infection."

This study was conducted to determine hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence in a sample of beauticians from Rio de Janeiro (Southeast Brazil) and to assess the knowledge and attitudes of these professionals regarding viral hepatitis and their practices during their activities. One hundred nineteen beauticians were recruited in September 2010. Serum samples were tested for total anti-HAV, total anti-HBc, HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HCV reactivity. A questionnaire was administered to identify socio-demographic risk factors and to determine knowledge and attitudes regarding viral hepatitis. Prevalence was 73.9% for total anti-HAV, 0% for HBsAg, 5.9% for anti-HBc, 23.6% for anti-HBs, and 0.8% for anti-HCV. Most professionals (81.5%) were well informed (4-7 correct answers) and reported the use of disposable sandpaper and nail sticks and sterilized pliers, but only 40% of them reported adequate processes of disinfection/sterilization. In conclusion, a high prevalence of HAV infection and a low prevalence of HBV and HCV infection were observed among beauticians. In addition, most of these individuals were not immune to HBV, indicating the need for vaccination campaigns targeting these professionals. Most of these professionals were well informed regarding viral hepatitis, although there was a gap in knowledge regarding disinfection and sterilization procedures. Public health prevention strategies should be adopted to improve education about disinfection/sterilization procedures for manicures and pedicures."

A cross-sectional study was performed from September 2014 to February 2015 in 67 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive (HIV+) and 37 HIV-seronegative (HIV-) patients. Blood collected from these patients was used to perform cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) lymphocyte blood counts and a white blood cell count, as well as to measure C-reactive protein (CRP) blood by flow cytometry and perform optical and immuno-turbidimetric detection. Enteric bacteria were isolated from the stool of patients, and their antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined using agar diffusion methods. The results showed that Escherichia coli was the main pathogenic bacteria in the digestive tracts of HIV+ (85.3%) and HIV- (81.1%) patients, and infections with Klebsiella sp. were also predominant among HIV- patients (29.4%). Resistance of Klebsiella sp. to ceftriaxone (CRO; P=0.001), gentamicin (GEN; P=0.005), chloramphenicol (CHL; P=0.0004), ciprofloxacin (CIP; P=0.005) and doxycycline (DOX; P<0.0001) was significantly higher in HIV+ patients than in HIV- patients. Enterobacter sp. showed high resistance to GEN (P=0.009) and CIP (P=0.001) in HIV+ patients compared to HIV- patients. Citrobacter sp. was resistant to GEN (P=0.009) in HIV+ patients compared to HIV- patients. Salmonella sp. showed high resistance to CHL (P<0.0001) and DOX (P<0.0001) in HIV+ patients compared to HIV- patients. Resistance of Serratia sp. to AMO (P=0.005), AMC (P=0.005) and CHL (P=0.005) was significantly higher in HIV+ patients than in HIV- patients. Lymphopenia was higher in HIV+ patients (36.8%) than in HIV- patients (2.7%). In 45.9% of the HIV- patients, the CRP rate was higher than 6mg/L compared to 16.2% in HIV+ patients. In general, bacterial multi-drug resistance in HIV+ patients (79.4%) was significantly higher (P<0.0001) than in HIV- patients (29.7%).

When this process was preceded by 18 h of incubation of HIV with patient serum samples, neutralizing antibody titers between 1:10 and 1:5,000 could be accurately determined in patient serum samples. In addition to the determination of neutralizing antibody titers (with the use of various serum dilutions and a constant virus concentration), neutralization indices could also be determined with different virus dilutions and a single dilution of patient serum."
1330,0.003,3.0,"Tenofovir is a nucleotide acting both as an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency (HIV) reverse transcriptase and as a competitor for hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA-directed DNA polymerase. Approved worldwide in 2001, tenofovir is used as a component of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients with HIV infection. Since 2008, it has also been indicated for treatment of chronic HBV infection or HIV/HBV co-infection. The aim of the treatment consists in suppressing viral replication, thus reducing hepatic complications and improving patient survival. Furthermore, tenofovir could represent an effective therapeutic option in lamivudine-resistant HBV patients. Tenofovir is eliminated unchanged through urine via glomerular filtration (80%) and proximal tubular secretion (20%). Thus, alterations in renal clearance may interfere with tenofovir pharmacokinetics and systemic drug concentrations, modifying the therapeutic response. Hence, a renal overload of tenofovir in patients with a pre-existing kidney impairment could result in a worsening of renal function. Following a brief introduction on HBV infection and its therapeutic options, we review the latest evidence, to our knowledge, on renal toxicity of tenofovir in HBV patients and on drug management."
3733,0.003,3.0,"Despite China's free antiretroviral therapy (ART) program, there are high rates of treatment failure, large sociodemographic disparities in care outcomes and emerging medication resistance. Understanding patient medication adherence behaviors and challenges could inform adherence interventions to maximize the individual and prevention benefits of ART. This study assessed recent nonadherence and treatment interruption among 813 HIV-infected adult outpatients in Guangzhou, China. Participants completed a behavioral survey, underwent chart review, and were tested for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Factors associated with suboptimal adherence were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Among 721 HIV-infected adults receiving ART, 18.9% reported recent nonadherence (any missed ART in the past four weeks) and 6.8% reported treatment interruption (four or more weeks of missed ART in the past year). Lower education, living alone, alcohol use, and being on ART one to three years were associated with recent nonadherence. Male gender, lower education, and being on ART one to three years were associated with treatment interruption. ART medication adherence interventions are needed in China that include individualized, long-term adherence plans sensitive to patients' educational and economic situations. These interventions should also consider possible gender disparities in treatment outcomes and address the use of alcohol during ART. Successful ART medication adherence interventions in China can inform other international settings that face similar adherence challenges and disparities."
4250,0.003,3.0,"Although there is discordance between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) blood plasma and seminal plasma viral loads (VL), little is known about the dynamics of VL rebound in these compartments upon discontinuation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Therefore, we sought to examine the relationship between blood and semen VL rebound after discontinuation of HAART. Participants in this substudy were men enrolled from two centers of a multicenter, placebo-controlled randomized trial of HIV therapeutic vaccination using ALVAC with or without Remune. With at least 2 years of sustained virologic suppression and following a 20-week vaccination course, subjects underwent structured HAART interruption. Fourteen men provided semen samples. Seven to 12 weeks after HAART interruption, all 14 men had detectable blood VLs whereas 8 of 14 had detectable seminal VLs. There was a significant correlation between blood and seminal VLs (Spearman r=0.58, p=0.03) at the time of semen collection. An earlier time to detectable blood VL after HAART interruption was associated with higher seminal VL (Spearman r=-0.64, p=0.02). These findings support the compartmentalization of HIV and underscore the importance of understanding the genital tract as an HIV reservoir in the quest to minimize HIV transmission."
3705,0.003,3.0,"This report presents results concerning the potential role of negative regulators in hematopoietic suppression observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected long-term cultures (LTC) of human bone marrow cells. Confluent stromal cell layers established from human bone marrow cells were exposed to HIV-1ADA, a monocytotropic strain of HIV-1. A progressive increase in the concentration of HIV-1 p24 antigen in cultures exposed to HIV-1ADA demonstrated that there was a productive infection. Cells from both noninfected and HIV-infected stromal cell layers produced factors that stimulated the proliferation of colony-forming units for granulocytes and macrophages (CFU-GM) from non-infected CD34+ cells. In contrast, when noninfected CD34+ cells were directly cocultured on intact stromal cell layers fewer CFU-GM and burst-forming units for erythroid cells (BFU-E) were detected in HIV-infected LTC than in noninfected LTC. One week after the addition of CD34+ cells, the number of CFU-GM in HIV-infected LTC in six of nine experiments was reduced compared to noninfected control LTC. In those six experiments, the number of CFU-GM was only 53 +/- 5% (SEM) of the number in noninfected LTC. The number of BFU-E in HIV-1-infected LTC was only 46 +/- 5% of the number in noninfected LTC (n = 5). There were fewer BFU-E in HIV-1-infected LTC, whether or not there was a reduced number of CFU-GM. Neutralizing antibody to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) had no effect on the number of BFU-E in HIV-infected LTC. The number of BFU-E, however, was 2.1 +/- 0.2-fold greater (n = 3) in HIV-infected LTC incubated with neutralizing antibody to interferon-alpha. In HIV-infected LTC with decreased numbers of CFU-GM, the number of CFU-GM was approximately 2-fold greater after incubation of HIV-infected LTC with anti-interleukin-4 (IL-4). The effect of anti-TNF-alpha was variable, and anti-transforming growth factor-beta had no effect on the number of CFU-GM in HIV-infected LTC. After 2 weeks, the number of CFU-GM in HIV-infected LTC incubated with anti-IL-4 and anti-TNF-alpha was 2- to 4-fold greater than in untreated HIV-infected LTC. Antibody treatment did not promote an increase in the number of CFU-GM in noninfected LTC or in LTC in which CFU-GM numbers were not reduced after HIV infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

9552,0.003,3.0,"The discovery of hepatitis C was the direct result of the landmark discoveries of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) and their serologies. Screening tests for HAV and HBV made it possible in the mid-1970s to examine cases of transfusion-associated hepatitis (TAH) and to demonstrate that only approximately 25% resulted from HBV and that none were related to HAV. Consequently, approximately 75% of TAH became classified as non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH). Subsequently, chimpanzee studies demonstrated that NANBH was a result of a transmissible agent Although it has been difficult to convince clinicians that NANBH was a serious disease because the overt manifestations are generally mild, it gradually became apparent that the NANBH agent often resulted in chronic hepatitis and sometimes evolved into cirrhosis. The NANBH agent remained a virologic enigma for the next decade until researchers at the Chiron Corporation used an ambitious molecular approach on large volumes of high-titer infectious chimpanzee plasma from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They extracted RNA, cloned it into an expression vector, and screened the expressed product with presumed immune sera. A single positive clone was found in the millions screened, and, within a year, the entire genome was sequenced and the agent was identified as a novel flavivirus--the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Retrospective analysis of pedigreed samples at the National Institute of Health (NIH) showed that 70% to 90% of NANBH cases were HCV related. The impact of HCV blood donor screening has been enormous. The single-antigen first-generation enzyme immunoassay (EIA-1) prevented 40,000 HCV infections within the first year, and the second-generation assay (EIA-2) has actually reduced new transfusion-related HCV infections to almost zero."
5968,0.003,3.0,"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques causes immune depletion and disease closely resembling human AIDS and is well recognized as the most relevant animal model for the human disease. Experimental investigations of viral pathogenesis and vaccine protection primarily involve a limited set of related viruses originating in sooty mangabeys (SIVsmm). The diversity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has evolved in humans in about a century; in contrast, SIV isolates used in the macaque model evolved in sooty mangabeys over millennia. To investigate the possible consequences of such different evolutionary histories for selection pressures and observed diversity in SIVsmm and HIV-1, we isolated, sequenced, and analyzed 20 independent isolates of SIVsmm, including representatives of 7 distinct clades of viruses isolated from natural infection. We found SIVsmm diversity to be lower overall than HIV-1 M group diversity. Reduced positive selection (i.e., less diversifying evolution) was evident in extended regions of SIVsmm proteins, most notably in Gag p27 and Env gp120. In addition, the relative diversities of proteins in the two lineages were distinct: SIVsmm Env and Gag were much less diverse than their HIV-1 counterparts. This may be explained by lower SIV-directed immune activity in mangabeys relative to HIV-1-directed immunity in humans. These findings add an additional layer of complexity to the interpretation and, potentially, to the predictive utility of the SIV/macaque model, and they highlight the unique features of human and simian lentiviral evolution that inform studies of pathogenesis and strategies for AIDS vaccine design."
9724,0.003,3.0,"There is limited knowledge about how to treat and interpret results from genotypic resistance assays in HIV-2 infection. Here, genetic variation in HIV-2 pol gene was studied in 20 of 23 known HIV-2 cases in Sweden. Five patients with signs of virological treatment failure were longitudinally studied. Clinical, virological and immunological data were collected and the protease (PR) and first half of the reverse transcriptase (RT) was amplified and directly sequenced from plasma samples. Moderate to extensive genetic evolution was observed in four of the five patients who failed treatment. Some mutations occurred at positions known to confer resistance in HIV-1, but many occurred at other positions in PR and RT. All patients had been treated with zidovudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, but none displayed a mutation at position 215, which is the primary zidovudine resistance site in HIV-1. Instead, a E219D mutation evolved in virus from two patients and a Q151M mutation evolved in two other patients. A M184V mutation indicative of lamivudine resistance was detected in three patients. The virus of one patient who had been treated with ritonavir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir successively acquired nine unusual mutations in the protease gene, most of which are not considered primary or secondary resistance mutations in HIV-1. Our data indicate that the evolutionary pathways that lead to antiretroviral resistance in HIV-2 and HIV-1 exhibit both similarities and differences. Genotypic HIV-2 resistance assays cannot be interpreted using algorithms developed for HIV-1, instead new algorithms specific for HIV-2 have to be developed."
1679,0.003,3.0,"The epidemic of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) poses a major ethical question: How can we control the epidemic and the harm that it causes without unjustly discriminating against particular social groups and without unnecessarily infringing on the freedom of individuals? This question pertains to three spheres of public policy in the United States: public health, the delivery of health care, and research. In the public health sphere, vigorous educational efforts will be required, as will modified approaches to intravenous drug use, prostitution, and homosexual and bisexual sexual activity. Carefully targeted, voluntary testing and screening programs should be coupled with counseling and with guarantees of confidentiality and nondiscrimination where these are appropriate. Both health care workers and the health care system have a moral obligation to provide care to people with HIV infection, but heroic self-sacrifice should not be required provided that infection control precautions are observed. Patients with neurological involvement and terminally ill patients will benefit from statutes allowing recognition of advance directives about preferred modes of care or nontreatment. There is a moral imperative to perform intensive research directed toward the understanding, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection and AIDS. The research process will raise challenging ethical questions."

Eight patients were infected by blood or blood products from graft-related transfusions and one by the graft itself; the remaining two patients were infected after transplantation and had independent risk factors. All patients received a triple-drug immunosuppressive regimen including cyclosporine. The mean duration of follow-up after liver transplantation was 52 months (standard error, +/- 32 months). Chronic graft rejection was documented in four cases. The cumulative incidences of HIV-related complications and HIV-related deaths were 82% and 27%, respectively. Three patients died rapidly of HIV disease. The survival rate 7 years after transplantation was 36% among the 11 HIV-infected patients, whereas it was approximately 70% among HIV-negative liver transplant recipients during the same period. The course of HIV infection in the four survivors did not appear to differ from that in other patients infected by blood transfusion."

4642,0.003,3.0,"A nationwide hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination program for neonates was launched in Iran in 1993. Despite the success of this program, concern about its long-term success still remains, because breakthrough infections due to emergence of surface mutants have been reported in immunized children. We aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of HBV and vaccine escape mutants among individuals born after the initiation of the nationwide vaccination program in Iran. This study included 1115 participants younger than 23 years old, with 223 in each age cohort. The presence of HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc was evaluated using an ELISA kit. HBV-DNA levels were measured in anti-HBc and/or HBsAg-positive subjects. PCR products were sequenced and mutations were identified. The overall HBsAg prevalence was 0.27 %. Anti-HBs and anti-HBc positive rates were 48 % and 0.18 %, respectively. Two individuals were positive for anti-HBc, one of whom was also positive for HBsAg, and the other was positive for anti-HBc only. HBV DNA was detected in three out of four anti-HBc-and /or HBsAg-positive subjects. An I195M mutation within the S gene was detected in two of the three HBV-DNA-positive cases. A very low prevalence of HBsAg and isolated anti-HBc were found in this study. The I195M mutation found in the surface gene could have been induced by immune pressure. Although the number of ''vaccine escape'' mutants found in this cohort was low, ongoing surveillance of breakthrough infections and escape mutants is still needed."
6713,0.003,3.0,"There is increasing evidence that cytokines contribute to the immunopathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It may be, therefore, that compensatory rises in circulating cytokine antagonists also occur in HIV infection and that such changes mark disease progression. To test this idea, plasma concentrations of the cytokine antagonists alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNFr) were measured in patients of different Centers for Disease Control (CDC) categories of HIV infection and in seronegative controls. Plasma levels of all these cytokine antagonists were higher in HIV-infected patients. IL-1ra and sTNFr concentrations were correlated with indicators of disease activity: positively with plasma neopterin and negatively with CD4+ T lymphocyte counts. alpha-MSH and sTNF r were greater in CDC groups III and IV, whereas IL-1ra was elevated only in the latter group. Because cytokines activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and adrenal steroids inhibit cytokine production, we measured circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol in HIV-infected patients and investigated relations among these hormones, cytokine antagonists, and markers of disease progression. It appears that these physiological modulators of cytokine activity are not closely linked to sTNFr, IL-1ra and alpha-MSH: there were no significant correlations between plasma concentrations of ACTH or cortisol and those of cytokine antagonists, nor were there correlations between hormones and markers of disease progression such as neopterin or CD4+ T cell counts. It is notable that severe adrenal insufficiency was extremely rare (3%) in HIV-infected patients; it was confined to the AIDS group and was consistently secondary to ACTH deficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

3731,0.003,3.0,"Many AIDS patients retain a high CD4+ T cell count despite a significant increase in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-determined viral load after various periods of treatment by combination therapy. Our study involved 10 such AIDS patients who showed this discordance. In this study, we characterized changes in the gag gene of HIV-1 isolated from the plasma of such patients. Viral RNA was extracted from plasma samples and the gag gene was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR. The PCR product was cloned and three clones from each patient were sequenced. All the sequences were aligned and compared with similar HIV-1 isolated from nontreated AIDS patients. Several kinds of changes were observed in the sequences including substitutions, frameshifts, and deletions. One patient showed a frameshift due to a missing G residue in the capsid-encoding region of the gene whereas another patient had virus with two different deletions. Such changes are probably due to combination therapy."
4169,0.003,3.0,"We have examined both the sequence changes in the LTR, gag, vif, vpr, vpx, tat, rev, vpu, env, and nef genes and the cell tropism of a cell-free stock of chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a pig-tailed macaque (PNb) that developed AIDS. This virus (SHIVKU-1) is highly pathogenic when inoculated into other macaques. DNA sequence analysis of PCR-amplified products revealed a total of 5 nucleotide changes in the LTR while vif had 2 consensus amino acid changes. The gag, vif, and vpx had no consensus amino acid substitutions, whereas vpr had 1 consensus substitution. The tat and rev genes of the HXB2 region of SHIVKU-1 had 2 and 1 consensus amino acid changes, respectively. The vpu gene of the HXB2 region of SHIV, which originally had an ACG at the beginning of the gene, reverted to an initiation ATG codon and in addition contained a consensus amino acid substitution at position 69 of this protein. As expected, the majority of the nucleotide substitutions were found in the env and nef genes. Thirteen and 5 amino acid changes were predicted for the corresponding Env and Nef proteins, respectively. In addition, one-third of the env gene clones isolated from the SHIVKU-1 stock had a 5-amino-acid deletion in the V4 region. Using three independent assays, we determined that the changes in the SHIVKU-1 were associated with an increase in the efficiency of replication in macrophages. The strikingly few consensus changes in the virus suggest that conversion of this virus to one capable of causing AIDS in pig-tailed macaques was associated with relatively few changes in the viral envelope and/or accessory genes. These results will provide the basis for the development of a pathogenic, molecular clone of SHIV capable of causing AIDS in pig-tailed macaques."

A cohort of 141 homosexual or bisexual men were assessed semiannually for CD4 count, HIV RNA viral load, medical and depressive symptoms, and a neuropsychological test battery, including psychomotor speed, verbal memory, and executive function. In a mixed-effects model, increasingly potent antiretroviral therapy was associated with improvement in tests of psychomotor processing speed. This study contributes to the growing literature documenting the longitudinal benefit provided by potent antiretroviral therapy for neuropsychological function, particularly psychomotor processing speed, in patients with HIV illness."
1551,0.003,3.0,"This exploratory analyses characterizes patterns of lymphocyte recovery in HIV-1-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and investigates their relationship with baseline indices and virologic responses. We modeled kinetics of total CD4+ lymphocytes, as well as naive (CD45RA+ CD62L+), and memory (CD45RA- CD45RO+) subsets in 48 patients treated with AZT/3TC/Ritonavir for 48 weeks in ACTG protocol 315. Cell kinetic indices were estimated by nonlinear regression methods and were correlated with baseline factors and virologic responses. Five different kinetic patterns were identified, including biphasic growth, growth-plateau, growth-depletion, decay-recovery, and biphasic decay. Although overall mean lymphocyte responses showed a biphasic increase in cell number, a careful investigation reveals that only one-third of patients actually followed the biphasic growth pattern in CD4+ cell response, while 44% of 48 patients from this study followed the growth-depletion pattern. CD4+ cell recovery during the first phase and the 48-week study period were negatively correlated with baseline CD4+ cell counts, and positively correlated with baseline viral load. Memory CD4+ cell recovery during the first phase was also negatively correlated with baseline memory CD4+ and total CD4+ cell number, but the recovery rate of memory CD4+ cells during the second phase was positively correlated with baseline CD4+ cell number. Patients with a decay in CD4+ cell count during treatment were more likely to have experienced virological rebound (58%) than patients with nondecay patterns (24%). The rate and magnitude of the absolute increase in total CD4+ and memory CD4+ cell number (but not naive CD4+ cells) during the second phase were lower in patients with viral rebound compared with patients with persistent viral suppression. These results show that the kinetics of lymphocyte reconstitution in response to potent antiretroviral therapy in individual patients vary considerably from the ""classic"" biphasic increase that characterizes the mean or median response pattern. Pattern analysis of lymphocyte kinetics may be useful for testing relationships among factors that modulate the response to treatment."
1004,0.003,3.0,"Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) results in gradual immunosuppression due to the loss of CD4+ T cells. In the wake of immune system breakdown, infected individuals may acquire multiple opportunistic infections and develop certain malignancies which ultimately account for the vast majority of deaths in these persons. A limited number of malignancies are directly associated with HIV infection and suggest a common tie between these tumors. Inappropriate immune surveillance resulting in insufficient inhibition of virus replication and inadequate control of the growth of transformed cells may contribute to the development of malignancies in HIV-infected individuals. Alternatively, malignancies in HIV infection may be the consequence of immune dysregulation. Cellular immune responses mediated by antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are of particular importance for immunologic control of viral infections and substantial information has been gathered about theses cells in HIV infection. The goal of this review is therefore to summarize recent findings regarding the cellular immune response to HIV with a particular focus on cytokines released by HIV-specific CTL."
7693,0.003,3.0,"Antiretroviral medications are becoming available for HIV-infected children in resource-limited settings. Maryknoll, an international Catholic charity, provided directly observed antiretroviral therapy to HIV-infected children in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Child care workers administered generic antiretroviral drugs twice daily to children, ensuring adherence. Treatment began with 117 late-stage HIV-infected children; 22 died of AIDS during the first 6 months. The rest were treated for at least 6 months and showed CD4 count increases comparable to those achieved in US and European children. Staffing cost for this program was approximately US $5 per child per month, or 15% more than the price of the medications. Drug toxicities were uncommon and easily managed. Directly observed antiretroviral therapy appears to be a promising, low-cost strategy for ensuring adherent treatment for HIV-infected children in a resource-limited setting."
5716,0.003,3.0,"It is generally agreed that hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication is reduced by hepatitis delta virus infection (HDV) and augmented by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, the precise nature of the interactions between HBV, HDV and HIV is controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of HIV infection on HBV and HDV replication, and on histological scores during delta virus superinfection in HDV-positive, chronic carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). We studied 38 men and six women, 15 of whom were HIV-positive and all of whom had at least one marker of HDV infection. Serum hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), HBV DNA, HDV RNA, anti-delta antigen antibodies (anti-HD) IgM, anti-HD IgG and hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) were tested for in the serum and liver, respectively; anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies were detected using a second-generation recombinant immunoblot assay. Histological specimens were scored blindly according to Knodell's classification for periportal and intralobular necrosis, portal inflammation and fibrosis. HBV DNA was detected more frequently in the HIV-positive patients than in those who were HIV-negative (25 vs 0%; P = 0.01), while markers of HDV replication (serum anti-HD IgM, serum HDV RNA and liver HDAg) were as frequent in the HIV-positive patients (69%, 40% and 50%, respectively) as in those who were HIV-negative (75%, 52% and 30%, respectively; P > 0.05). By contrast, 31% of the HIV-positive patients were serum HDAg-positive compared to only 6% of the HIV-negative patients (P = 0.001). HDV antigenaemia and anti-HD antibodies usually fluctuated in the HIV-positive patients during follow-up. The mean Knodell score was similar in the HIV-positive (11.5 +/- 3.2) and HIV-negative (10.7 +/- 2) subgroups, as was the mean semi-quantitative index of hepatic necrosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Our results provide evidence that in HDV-positive patients: (1) HIV infection counters the inhibitory effect of HDV superinfection on HBV replication; (2) serum anti-HD IgM. HDV RNA and liver HDAg are not more frequent in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative patients, suggesting that HIV infection has no effect on HDV replication (although the significance of the increased frequency of HD antigenaemia remains unclear); (3) the histological severity of liver disease is not influenced by HIV status."

Data were analyzed to assess associations between study variables and whether participants returned for care following an initial mental health assessment. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the extent to which the addition of measures of health beliefs and HIV-related stigma would enhance the predictive capacity of a dropout model that included demographics and health status measures. As health beliefs and HIV-related stigma were added to the model, the predictive capacity increased significantly (R(2)=0.29 to R(2)=0.63, p<0.05). Those who did not return for care had higher levels of perceived barriers to mental health care, higher levels of HIV-related stigma, were more likely to be of non-white ethnicity and had lower T-cell counts. These findings indicate that mental health providers may need to ensure care systems are responsive to the social and cultural characteristics of clients, and the HIV epidemic itself, in order to effectively engage clients into care."

HIV-induced lung disease continues to represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality, although the spectrum of pulmonary diseases has changed. HIV significantly affects the lung, causing acute and chronic cellular changes in the alveolar space. The impact of ART on lung immunology still needs to be fully elucidated. Similar to the periphery, ART affects HIV viral load and reconstitutes CD4(+) T cells in the lung. ART has been associated with significant decreases in bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocytes and increases in B-cell numbers and functionality, resulting in improved immune responses to vaccinations. There are substantial clinical implications of these ART-induced alterations, including the emergence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and the increased incidences of noninfectious lung diseases, such as lung cancer and chronic obstructive lung disease. There continues to be many unanswered questions regarding the effects of ART on lung health and, in particular, the immune system. Growing knowledge in this area will hopefully diminish the incidence of these noninfectious lung diseases and further improve the health of individuals living with HIV. "

The latest projections from the International Diabetes Federation suggest that 190 million people worldwide currently have type 2 diabetes. In addition, > or = 300 million people worldwide have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). These statistics represent an epidemic of major proportions--possibly the largest epidemic in human history--in terms of glucose intolerance and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk because individuals with IGT are at substantially higher risk for diabetes and CVD than are members of the general population. Along with IGT, the metabolic syndrome comprises other major CVD risk factors, including insulin resistance, central obesity, and dyslipidemia; insulin resistance has been implicated as the single most common cause of the syndrome. Although the exact prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is unknown, the syndrome is widespread among adults in developed nations, becoming more prevalent with age. Epidemiologic data suggest that in patients with schizophrenia or affective disorders, both diabetes and obesity are 1.5 to 2.0 times more prevalent than in the general population. Furthermore, because adverse effects of certain therapies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and psychiatric disorders increase the risk for developing diabetes, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome, such therapies should be carefully chosen, particularly considering CVD risk. Appropriate therapy may be determined via screening of patients for levels of fasting blood glucose and lipids, as well as other CVD risk factors, before initiating use of second-generation antipsychotic agents or highly active antiretroviral therapy."

All patients naïve to antiretrovirals who had > or =1 genotypic resistance testing at the Institute of Infectious Diseases (Brescia, Northern Italy) between 2001 and 2006 were analyzed. Primary resistance mutations were defined using epidemiological and clinical criteria. Mutations were interpreted using the Stanford University Algorithm. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess possible predictors of primary resistance mutations. Among 569 patients, 11% presented > or =1 mutation. Prevalence of primary resistance mutations to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), and protease inhibitors (PI) was 6.3%, 6%, and 1.6%, respectively. The most frequent mutations to NRTI were substitutions at position 215 (215Y in 3 patients, and 215 revertants in 16), 41L (13), 219Q (12), and 210W (10). Among mutations to NNRTI, 103N was found in 21 patients, while 181C, 188L, and 190A/S in 8, 3, and 4 patients, respectively. Fifty-one patients (9%) had high-to-intermediate resistance to > or =1 antiretroviral drug before starting the treatment. Regarding the new generation drugs, nine patients had intermediate resistance to etravirine, five patients had intermediate resistance to tipranavir, while five, one, and seven patients had low resistance to etravirine, tipranavir, and darunavir. Homosexuals were more likely to harbor a virus with primary resistance mutations (OR:2.68; 95% CI:1.44-5.00; P = 0.002) while non-Italian nationality was protective (OR:0.38; 95% CI:0.17-0.86; P = 0.020).

The aim of this study was to verify whether, in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, immunologic pulmonary abnormalities set the stage for the lung complications. For this purpose, a phenotypic and functional characterization of lymphocytes recovered from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of 24 patients with clinical symptoms and signs of HIV infections was performed (six patients with constitutional disease, five patients with neurologic manifestations, and 13 patients with full-blown AIDS). Our data showed that (1) in patients with HIV, the percentage and absolute number of pulmonary CD8 cells were significantly increased over those in control subjects (in 25% of these patients, mostly with full-blown AIDS, CD8 cells sustained an alveolitis); (2) lung CD4 cells were reduced in percentage but not in absolute number, with the exception of patients with AIDS in whom a significant decrease of the absolute number of BAL CD4 cells has been found (further phenotypic analysis of CD4 lymphocytes showed a reduction of the expression of T4A, B, and E with respect to the T4, T4C, T4D, and T4F epitopes); (3) although the number of BAL cells bearing NK-related determinants was increased, we were unable to demonstrate any in vitro natural killer cell activity. We suggest that the impairment of a proper NK activity in the lungs of these patients might be central to the mechanisms leading to the in situ immunodeficiency state and to the pulmonary complications characterizing AIDS."

Insight in the predictors or correlates of poor HRQoL may be helpful to identify patients most in need of additional support and to design appropriate interventions. A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2012 and April 2013 in 10 healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Patients who were at least 6 months on cART were randomly selected and individual patient data were retrieved from medical records. HRQoL was measured by the WHOQoL-HIVBREF, depressive-symptoms by the Kessler-6 scale, and stigma by the Kalichman internalized AIDS-related stigma scale. Multivariate linear regression analysis was carried-out to examine associations between HRQoL and the other variables. A total of 664 patients (response-rate 95%) participated in the study. A higher level of depressive-symptoms was most strongly and consistently associated with a lower HRQoL, both in terms of the magnitude of the relationship and in the number of HRQoL domains associated with it. Also, a higher level of HIV-stigma was associated with a lower HRQoL except for the physical domain, while obtaining sufficient nutritious food and job opportunity were associated with a better HRQoL except for the spiritual and social domains, respectively. Demographics, clinical, and treatment characteristics yielded few significant associations with HRQoL. Our study findings suggest that interventions to improve HRQoL should focus on reducing depressive-symptoms and HIV-stigma, and on enhancing food security and job opportunity. "
7640,0.003,3.0,"Dementia was a frequent consequence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in developed countries before antiretroviral therapy (ART) became available and remains a common neurologic complication of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among patients receiving appropriate therapy. The epidemiology of HIV dementia (HIV-D) in Africa remains unclear 20+ years into the AIDS epidemic. Early studies of cognitive impairment in HIV-positive populations in Africa were limited by vaguely defined criteria for cognitive impairment, inadequate assessment tools lacking ecologic validation, and the absence of normative population data. More recent studies have clarified definitions of impairment, utilized more sophisticated measures, and included normative comparisons. Unfortunately, these detailed neuropsychiatric assessments are not feasible for population-based studies or routine clinical implementation. Therefore, the prevalence data available for HIV-D in Africa represents rates found in people presenting to tertiary care centers and are unlikely to reflect HIV-D rates in the general population. As ART becomes available in Africa, future research efforts must provide a better understanding of the epidemiology of HIV-D, the effects of available ART regimens on HIV-D in this population, and the impact of HIV-D on ART adherence. Universally accepted terminology and criteria for HIV-D are needed. Population-based studies will require the development of neuropsychiatric batteries that can be adapted across a range of African environments. Ideally, these measures will be viable for nonphysician care providers to use as screening tools in the first stage of epidemiologic studies. Such screening tools could also serve as clinical indicators of possible HIV-related cognitive impairment facilitate implementation of ART adherence."

All the three patients were treated with co-trimoxazole. One patient recovered and was discharged; another patient improved with treatment but died after jugular vein cannulation and the third patient succumbed to cryptosporidial diarrhoea.

Thus, being HCV-free while having acquired HIV-1 via intravenous drug use is a rare situation. Claudin-1 is a protein involved in intracellular tight-junctions and has been identified as a major cellular co-receptor for HCV infection. Our objective was to determine whether Claudin-1 gene (CLDN1) mutations might be involved in natural resistance to HCV infection. We conducted a case-control study. All recruited patients acquired HIV-1 infection via intravenous drug use route before 1995. The case study patients remained free from HCV infection (negative anti-HCV antibodies and HCV-RNA). The control study patients was co-infected with HCV (positive anti-HCV antibodies). Direct genomic sequencing of the CLDN1 gene coding region and adjacent intron/exons junctions was performed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A total of 138 Caucasian patients were enrolled. Twenty-two patients (cases) were free from HCV infection and 116 (controls) were co-infected with HCV. We found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) described previously with no significant differences in allele frequencies between cases and controls. In conclusion, despite being a major cellular co-receptor for HCV entry in vitro, we did not identify any specific substitution in CLDN1 gene coding region in our study patients highly exposed but resistant to HCV infection in vivo. Other cellular co-factors involved in HCV infection should be investigated in this highly-exposed intravenous drug users patients."
4996,0.003,3.0,"Depression is associated with poor antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS. This relationship may be moderated by an individual's social network characteristics. Our study sought to examine social network correlates of treatment adherence among HIV-positive men recruited from social service agencies throughout Los Angeles County (N = 150) to inform technology-driven social support interventions for this population. We administered egocentric social network and computer-assisted survey interviews focused on demographic characteristics, health history, depressive symptoms, and ART adherence, where adherence was assessed by the number of reasons participants missed taking their medication, if ever. Significant univariate correlates of adherence were included in a multivariable regression analysis, where the moderating effect of having a network member who reminds participants to take their HIV medication on the relationship between depression and adherence was tested. Over 60% of participants reported clinically significant depressive symptoms; this was significantly associated with lower adherence among those without someone in their social network to remind them about taking their HIV medication, even after adjusting for covariates in an ordinary least squares regression (adjusted mean difference b = -1.61, SE = 0.42, p = 0.0003). Having a network member who reminds participants to take their ART medication significantly ameliorated the negative association between depression and treatment adherence, especially for those reporting greater depressive symptoms (p = 0.0394). Additionally, participants demonstrated high rates of technology use to communicate with social network members. In order to achieve the aims of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, innovative interventions addressing mental health to improve ART adherence are needed. Network strategies that leverage technology may be helpful for improving ART adherence among HIV-positive men with comorbid depressive symptoms."
2226,0.003,3.0,"In this study, we investigated the causes of death and the factors associated with mortality in a cohort of patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in Burkina Faso, an African country with limited resources. This retrospective cohort study included patients aged 15 years and older who started HAART for the first time between January 2003 and December 2008 in 14 health districts. We used survival analyses, including the Kaplan-Meier method, to examine potential predictors of death and two Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios for death, first from baseline covariates and then from time-dependent covariates. A total of 6641 patients initiated HAART during this period; of these, 5608 were included in the analysis. By the end of the study period, 4310 of those patients were still receiving HAART, 690 had died, 207 had been transferred and 401 were lost to follow-up. The median duration of follow-up was 23.2 months [interquartile range (IQR): 12.4-36.9], and the overall incidence of mortality was 6 per 100 person-years. The clinical stage, CD4 count, body mass index (BMI), haemoglobin level, HAART regimen, gender, age, profession and year of initiation were the primary risk factors associated with death. In the multivariate analysis, BMI, clinical stage, treatment regimen and CD4 count remained significantly associated with death. The most frequent causes of death were wasting syndrome, tuberculosis and anaemia. This result highlights the already advanced stage of immunodeficiency among patients in Burkina Faso when they start HAART. Testing patients for HIV and starting antiretroviral therapy earlier are necessary to further reduce the mortality of patients living with HIV. This study provides a solid evidence base with which future evaluations of HAART in Burkina Faso can be compared."
4697,0.003,3.0,"Body composition in HIV-infected individuals is subject to many influences. We conducted a pilot 6-month randomized trial of 68 women living with AIDS (WLA) from rural India. High protein intervention combined with education and supportive care delivered by HIV-trained village women (activated social health activist [Asha] life [AL]) was compared to standard protein with usual care delivered by village community assistants (usual care [UC]). Measurements included CD4 counts, ART adherence, socio-demographics, disease characteristics (questionnaires); and anthropometry (bioimpedance analyzer). Repeated measures analysis of variance modeled associations. AL significantly gained in BMI, muscle mass, fat mass, ART adherence, and CD4 counts compared to UC, with higher weight and muscle mass gains among ART adherent (≥66%) participants who had healthier immunity (CD4 ≥450). BMI of WLA improved through high protein supplementation combined with education and supportive care. Future research is needed to determine which intervention aspect was most responsible."
7859,0.003,3.0,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has set a target of treating 3 million people with antiretroviral treatment (ART) by 2005. In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-positive tuberculosis (TB) patients could significantly contribute to this target. ART (stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine) was initiated in Thyolo district, Malawi, in April 2003, and all HIV-positive TB patients were considered eligible and offered ART. Despite this, only 44 (13%) of 352 TB patients were eventually started on ART by the end of November 2003. Most TB patients leave hospital after 2 weeks to complete the initial phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment (rifampicin-based) in the community, and ART is offered to HIV-positive TB patients after they have started the continuation phase of treatment (isoniazid/ ethambutol). ART is only offered at hospital, while the majority of TB patients take their continuation phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment from health centres. HIV-positive TB patients therefore find it difficult to access ART. In this paper, we discuss a series of options to increase the uptake of ART among HIV-positive TB patients. The main options are: 1) to hospitalise HIV-positive TB patients with a view to starting ART in the continuation phase in hospital; 2) to decentralise ART delivery so ART can be delivered at health centres; 3) to replace nevirapine with efavirenz so ART can be started earlier in the initial phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Decentralisation of ART from hospitals to health centres would greatly improve ART access."
5662,0.003,3.0,"In 2005, it was estimated that 2.3 million children below 15 years of age were living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS and 570,000 children below 15 years died. Maternal-infant or vertical transmission is the most common mode of HIV infection in children. As transplacental passage of maternal anti-HIV antibodies, diagnosis of HIV infection in young infants relies on virologic assays. Infants older than 18 months of age can be diagnosed by serology alone. Pediatric HIV infections are classified according to Center for Disease Control and Prevention 1994 revised classification system. The understanding of viral pathogenesis, the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy, and the ability to quantitate viral burden have led to significant reduction in disease progression and morbidity in HIV-infected children. As survival improves, these children will require anesthesia care and pain treatment during the course of their illness. Considerations for the anesthesiologist include: possible involvement of multiple organ systems, adverse reactions and drug interactions of antiretroviral agents and adequate infection control to prevent HIV transmission in hospital and other infections to the immunocompromised patients. Finally, care should be taken not to violate confidentiality."
6790,0.003,3.0,"There is little information on infections caused by larval cestodes in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in developed countries. Two infections by larval cestodes were found in 714 HIV-infected patients studied from 1998 to 2004 at the Hospital General Universitario de Elche in Spain (Mediterranean Coast). The first patient was a Colombian immigrant diagnosed as having neurocysticercosis, and subsequently found to have HIV infection. The second case was an HIV-infected Spanish patient who developed hydatid disease of the liver, lung and peritoneum. Both patients died. Although infrequent, infections by larval cestodes constitute a cause of disease in HIV-infected patients in developed countries, and might be linked with a more severe presentation."

9362,0.003,3.0,"Chronic hepatitis C can be associated with extrahepatic manifestations; thus, we explored the association of this viral infection with dilated cardiomyopathy in a group of sixty-three patients with a cardiac ejection fraction of less than 40% determined by an echocardiogram in a prospective study. Two of the forty-one patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (4.8%) had serum antibodies to the hepatitis C virus and one of those had hepatitis C virus RNA (2.4%) in serum, consistent with chronic hepatitis C. One of the 22 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (4.5%) had serum antibodies to the hepatitis C virus but the hepatitis C virus RNA was not detected in their serum, consistent with prior infection but not chronic hepatitis C. In this study, chronic hepatitis C was not prevalent in the group of patients, although the only patient with chronic hepatitis C had non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. As a genetic predisposition to develop cardiomyopathy secondary to chronic hepatitis C has been suggested to be relevant in this type of complication, studies that include different racial and ethnic groups are warranted, as treatment of the hepatitis may lead to resolution of the cardiomyopathy."

We asked whether phosphorylation could affect Vpr activity. Vpr was found to be phosphorylated on serine residues in transiently transfected and infected cells. Residues 79, 94, and 96 were all found to be phosphorylated, as assessed by alanine mutations. Mutation of Ser-79 to Ala abrogated effects of Vpr on cell cycle progression, whereas mutation of Ser-94 and Ser-96 had no effect. Simultaneous mutation of all three Vpr serine residues attenuated HIV-1 replication in macrophages, whereas single and double Ser mutations had no effect."
6194,0.003,3.0,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is thought to be involved in the pathogenic and metabolic events associated with HIV-1 infection. We assessed whether carriage of the TNF-α gene promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with lipodystrophy and metabolic derangements in HIV-1-infected patients treated with cART. We also assessed variations in TNF-α receptor plasma levels. The study group comprised 286 HIV-1-infected patients (133 with and 153 without lipodystrophy) and 203 uninfected controls (UC). TNF-α -238G > A, -308G > A, and -863 C > A SNP were assessed using PCR-RFLPs on white cell DNA. Plasma sTNF-α R1 and R2 levels were measured by ELISA. Student's t test, the χ(2) test, Pearson correlations, and the logistic regression test were performed for statistical analysis. The TNF-α -308G > A SNP was significantly associated with lipodystrophy in the univariate analysis (p = 0.04). This association, however, was no longer significant in the multivariate analysis. A meta-analysis of the published literature and our own data, which included 284 patients with lipodystrophy and 338 without lipodystrophy, showed that there was no relationship between the TNF-α -238G > A and -308G > A SNP and lipodystrophy (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). HIV-1-infected patients had greater sTNF-α R2 plasma levels than UC (p = 0.001) whereas sTNF-α R1 and R2 levels were not significantly different in both the HIV-1-infected cohorts, lipodystrophy vs. nonlipodystrophy (p = NS). In our cohort of white Spaniards the TNF-α -238G > A, -308G > A, and -863C > A SNP were not associated with lipodystrophy in HIV-1-infected patients treated with cART. This finding was replicated in a meta-analysis of the published data, which showed no associations between the TNF-α -238G > A and -308G > A SNP and lipodystrophy. In HIV-1-infected patients under cART there is a systemic overproduction of sTNF-α R2, which is unrelated to the presence of lipodystrophy."
5491,0.003,3.0,"Virus load based on levels of functional reverse transcriptase (RT) was measured in plasma from 50 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected persons, in 87 samples from 10 HIV-1 seroconversion panels, and in 100 uninfected persons by use of Amp-RT, an ultrasensitive RT assay. Of the 50 clinical samples, 38 (76%) were Amp-RT positive, while all uninfected controls were negative. Pearson's correlation coefficient of RNA and RT levels was .73 for all samples, .86 for seroconversion samples, and .49 for clinical samples. Calculated ratios of RT activity to virion RNA varied widely during both early and late stages of infection. Mean RT:RNA ratios in 8 seroconversion panels and in 12 (34.3%) of 35 individual clinical samples were significantly lower than the ratio for a reference virus. However, ratios were stable in individual seroconversions over time. These data demonstrate that RT activity can be used to quantitate plasma virus load and provide evidence of different levels of virion-associated RT among HIV-1-infected persons."
2608,0.003,3.0,"Both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are important global public health problems with shared transmission routes. Although HIV/HCV coinfection is not uncommon, the prevalence rates vary significantly across different studies and regions. In Taiwan, injection drug users have become the major contributors to the HIV/AIDS epidemic since 2005. Because the prevalence of HCV infection is high in injection drug users, this HIV epidemic is also associated with a significant increase of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan. To control Taiwan's HIV epidemic, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) launched a harm-reduction program in 2006. The HIV epidemic, the percentage attributed to injection drug users, and the prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection gradually declined thereafter. In this article, we aimed to thoroughly examine the current literatures of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan and hope to provide a better understanding of the needs for the management of this coinfection. We conducted a narrative review and searched for literature from PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library database untill August 2015. Studies relevant to the epidemiology and associated risk factors of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan were examined and discussed."

857,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the central nervous system is associated with characteristic virological, clinical, and neuropathological findings in adults and children. Productive infection in the brain and spinal cord occurs in blood-derived macrophages, resident microglia, and multinucleated giant cells. Previous work implicated indirect mechanisms for neurotoxicity by HIV-1 gene products or by factors secreted from HIV-1--infected macrophages. However, this cannot explain the paradox between the small numbers of infected cells and the widespread tissue pathology. Based on recent studies from our laboratories, we suggest that HIV-1--infected macrophages can initiate neurotoxicity, which is then amplified through cell-to-cell interactions with astrocytes. Macrophage-astrocyte interactions produce cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta and arachidonic metabolites that cause astroglial proliferation and neuronal injury. Inevitably, the astrogliosis serves to amplify these cellular processes while brain infection maintains itself in macrophage and microglia and possibly in astrocytes (by restricted infection). These findings, taken together, provide fresh insights into how low numbers of productively infected cells could elicit progressive and devastating neurological impairment during HIV-1 disease, and suggest therapeutic strategies to interrupt the pathological process."
1636,0.003,3.0,"CD4+ T cells are thought to contribute to antiviral immune responses by secretion of cytokines thereby providing help to CD8+ T and B cells. However, perforin-positive cytotoxic CD4+ T cells have been described in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients suggesting a role not only of CD8+ but also of CD4+ T cells for killing virus-infected cells. We investigated 76 patients with viral hepatitis [15 hepatitis B virus (HBV), 22 HBV/hepatitis D virus and 17 hepatitis C virus (HCV)] for cytotoxic CD4+ T cells. The frequency of perforin-positive CD4+ T cells in viral hepatitis was highly variable ranging from < 1% to more than 25%. Perforin-positive CD4+ T cells displayed the phenotype of terminally differentiated effector cells (CD28-, CD27-). The highest frequencies of CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were found in patients with delta hepatitis (P = 0.04 vs HBV and HCV patients), and the presence of CD4+ CTLs was associated with elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels (P = 0.01) and decreased platelet counts (P = 0.03). Perforin-positive CD4+ T cells decreased in two individuals during spontaneous clearance of acute hepatitis C. Significant associations were found between the frequency of perforin-expressing CD4+ cells and age (P = 0.04), perforin-positive CD8+ cells (P < 0.001) and perforin-positive CD4-/CD8- lymphoid cells (P = 0.002). Differentiated CD27- effector CD4+ CTLs can be detected in patients with viral hepatitis. In particular in patients with more advanced liver disease, the accumulation of perforin-positive T cells with age could be one correlate for the more severe course of viral hepatitis in elderly individuals."
4323,0.003,3.0,"Fitness disadvantage of the transitional intermediates compared to the initial R5 viruses has been suggested to constitute one of the blockades to coreceptor switching, explaining the late appearance of X4 viruses. Using a simian model for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor switching, we demonstrate in this study that similar molecular evolutionary pathways to coreceptor switch occur in more than one R5 simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)(SF162P3N)-infected macaque. In infected animals where multiple pathways for expansion or switch to CXCR4 coexist, fitness of the transitional intermediates in coreceptor usage efficiency influences their outgrowth and representation in the infecting virus population. Dualtropic and X4 viruses appear at different disease stages, but they have lower entry efficiency than the coexisting R5 strains, which may explain why they do not outcompete the R5 viruses. Similar observations were made in two infected macaques with coreceptor switch, providing in vivo evidence that fitness disadvantage is an obstacle to X4 emergence and expansion."

2791,0.003,3.0,"Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection often develop complications related directly to the infection, as well as to treatment. Aging, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities increase the risk of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. HIV-associated neurologic complications encompass a wide spectrum of pathophysiology and symptomatology. Cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions are common among persons with HIV infection. Although some specific antiretroviral medications have been linked to disease development, traditional risk factors (e.g., smoking) have major roles. Prevention and management of viral hepatitis coinfection are important to reduce morbidity and mortality, and new anti-hepatitis C agents produce high rates of sustained virologic response. Antiretroviral-associated metabolic complications include dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and loss of bone mineral density. Newer options generally pose less risk of significant systemic toxicity and are better tolerated. Family physicians who care for patients with HIV infection have a key role in identifying and managing many of these chronic complications."
2679,0.003,3.0,"Since expression of both interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2-receptor-alpha (IL-2R-alpha) by lymphocytes is inhibited by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro, we hypothesized that HIV-co-infection among persons with tuberculosis (TB) might impair T-lymphocyte responses to TB via this mechanism. We measured soluble IL-2R-alpha (sIL-2R-alpha), a surrogate marker of T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation, and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor I (sTNF-RI) in sera from West African patients categorized into 4 groups: those with TB alone (TB+ HIV-, n = 55), CD4-matched groups with TB and HIV co-infection (TB+ HIV+, n = 50) or HIV infection alone (TB- HIV+, n = 35), and patients with neither disease (TB- HIV-, n = 35). The median level of sIL-2R-alpha was markedly greater in the TB+ HIV- group (1580 U/mL) compared to the TB- HIV- (670 U/mL; P < 0.001) and TB- HIV+ (880 U/mL; P < 0.01) groups. More importantly, the median concentration of sIL-2R-alpha was much lower in the TB+ HIV+ group (855 U/mL) compared to the TB+ HIV- group (1580 U/mL; P < 0.01) despite similar levels of sTNF-RI. These results suggest that T-lymphocyte activation in TB patients is impaired by HIV co-infection and, furthermore, this suppressive effect was independent of numerical depletion of CD4 lymphocytes. Impairment to IL-2-signalling might contribute to the profound impact that HIV has had on both the incidence and the clinicopathological manifestations of TB."

9217,0.003,3.0,"Indinavir is a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of patients with HIV infection. Combination antiretroviral therapy with indinavir plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is associated with greater reductions in viral load, greater increases in CD4+ cell counts, and reduced morbidity and mortality when compared with 2 NRTIs alone. In the landmark clinical trial ACTG 320, the rate of progression to AIDS or death (primary end-point) among zidovudine-experienced patients treated with indinavir, zidovudine and lamivudine was approximately half that of patients who received only zidovudine plus lamivudine (6 vs 11%; p < 0.001). The durability of an indinavir-containing regimen was demonstrated in Merck protocol 035, an ongoing trial in which a significant proportion of patients had sustained viral suppression for up to 3 years. Merck protocol 039, also an ongoing trial, showed a greater effect on surrogate markers of HIV disease progression with indinavir-based triple therapy than with zidovudine plus lamivudine or indinavir monotherapy in patients with advanced disease (median baseline CD4+ count 15 cells/microL). Numerous additional clinical trials have established the beneficial antiviral and immunological effects of indinavir in both antiretroviral-naive and -experienced patients with HIV infection. Indinavir is associated with various drug class-related adverse events, including gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g. nausea, diarrhoea), headache and asthenia/fatigue. A lipodystrophy syndrome has been commonly reported with indinavir and other protease inhibitors combined with NRTIs, but it has also been reported in many protease inhibitor-naive patients, and a definitive causal link has not been established between the syndrome and protease inhibitors. Nephrolithiasis may develop in about 9% of patients receiving indinavir but does not appear to be associated with other protease inhibitors; <0.5% of patients receiving indinavir discontinue the drug because of nephrolithiasis, which may be the extreme end of a continuum of crystal-related renal syndromes. Additional renal problems (e.g. nephropathy) have been reported in small numbers of patients receiving indinavir. In summary, indinavir is a protease inhibitor with well documented efficacy when used as part of combined therapy in patients with HIV infection. Both US and UK treatment guidelines continue to recommend protease inhibitor-based regimens including indinavir as a first-line option. Indinavir is being studied as a twice daily and once daily regimen with a low dosage of ritonavir as a way to alleviate tolerability, drug interaction and patient compliance/adherence issues. Indinavir-containing triple therapy has demonstrated positive effects not only on surrogate markers of disease progression, but also on clinical end-points of mortality and morbidity in patients with HIV disease. Protease inhibitors are a significant advance in the care of patients with HIV infection, and, in an era of evidence-based medicine, indinavir represents an important component of antiretroviral treatment strategies."

Delivery of attenuated lentiviruses as proviral DNA would be a simple means of immunization, but the efficiency of this method of delivery is not known. In this study, macaques were readily infected following inoculation of plasmid DNA encoding proviral simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac239), whether given i.m. (300 microg) or epidermally (15 microg), with all four animals succumbing to AIDS at a mean of 26 weeks following inoculation. Using a human skin explant model, we found that the 50% infectious dose (ID50) of proviral SIV or HIV-1 plasmid may be as low as 1 microg when delivered to skin by gold particle bombardment using a gene gun. An infectious proviral clone of SIV mac239 with a 105 bp deletion in the 3' nef/LTR overlap region was engineered (SIVsbbc delta3), analogous to the initial common nef/LTR deletion in HIV-1 strains isolated from an Australian cohort of long-term slow-progressors. Two further macaques were also readily infected with SIVsbbc delta3 after i.m. injection of 300 microg of highly purified plasmid DNA. Unexpectedly, in one macaque inoculated with SIVsbbc delta3 DNA, SIV strains isolated three to six weeks after infection had completely repaired the nef/LTR deletion with wild-type sequence, and eventually progressed to AIDS. The mechanism used to rebuild this deletion with wild-type sequence, presumably derived from an intact 5' LTR, is unclear, but possibilities include RNA read-through errors from the plasmid DNA and recombination with residual plasmid DNA at the inoculation site."

Specific prophylaxis regimens exist for several opportunistic infections, and effective antiretroviral therapy reduces the risk of most others. Other AIDS-defining conditions include wasting syndrome and HIV encephalopathy. AIDS-defining malignancies include Kaposi sarcoma, systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and invasive cervical cancer. Although not an AIDS-defining condition, anal cancer is common in patients with HIV infection.

8600,0.003,3.0,"Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at risk for a variety of liver diseases. We undertook a retrospective study of 501 HIV-seropositive patients to assess the yield of percutaneous liver biopsy. The most common indications for liver biopsy were liver test abnormalities (89.5%), fever for 2 weeks (71.9%), and hepatomegaly (52.0%). The most common biopsy-derived diagnosis was Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), seen in 87 (17.4%) biopsies. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found in 13 biopsies (2.6%). In 28 biopsies (5.6%) mycobacteria was seen, but speciation of the organism was not possible. Chronic active viral hepatitis was seen in 60 biopsies (12.0%). Opportunistic hepatic infection from other organisms was found in 14 biopsies (2.8%). The most common neoplasm was lymphoma, which was seen in 12 biopsies (2.4%). MAC infection of the liver was associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.01). Among patients with fever for 2 weeks after an extensive negative workup including bone marrow biopsy, 58.2% had a diagnosis by liver biopsy. Overall, 64.3% of liver biopsies yielded a histopathological diagnosis, 45.7% of which were potentially treatable. We could not evaluate whether liver biopsy had a positive effect on patient outcome and survival, nor did we attempt to prove that liver biopsy resulted in a change in treatment or a change in preprocedure clinical diagnosis. Thus, questions about the efficacy of liver biopsy cannot be answered. Liver biopsy may be a helpful diagnostic tool in HIV-positive patients with fever, liver test abnormalities or hepatomegaly."
5540,0.003,3.0,"Investigation by polymerase chain reaction of HBV-DNA in serum from chronic hepatitis B virus carriers is not widely used for routine diagnosis because polymerase chain reaction assays are complex and may be too sensitive. We investigated the sensitivity, the specificity and the possible value for clinical use of a simplified polymerase chain reaction method in which a single, 30 cycles round of polymerase chain reaction is performed using only 10 microliters of serum treated with microwaves. The efficiency of the polymerase chain reaction in amplifying HBV-DNA was greater after microwave irradiation of serum than after alkaline extraction, but lower than after protein digestion and phenol chloroform precipitation. Despite its simplicity and high sensitivity, the assay was very specific. Studies in anti-HBe positive chronic hepatitis B virus carriers demonstrated HBV-DNA sequences in 1/15 (7%) healthy carriers, in 4/20 (20%) patients with slight alanine aminotransferase elevation, in 16/18 (89%) with marked alanine aminotransferase elevation and in all 20 with fluctuating alanine aminotransferase levels. In the latter, HBV-DNA was detected either at exacerbation (two cases), during remission (one case) or both (17 cases). HBV-DNA was detected by classical dot-blot hybridization in only 24/58 (41%) samples that were positive by the simplified polymerase chain reaction method. Although extremely high sensitivity is not achieved, microwave irradiation of serum simplifies considerably the detection of small amounts of HBV-DNA and makes polymerase chain reaction suitable for monitoring patients in whom weak hepatitis B virus replication is associated with ongoing liver disease."
5458,0.003,3.0,"The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and aetiology of fever of unknown origin (FUO) in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), to assess the value of the tests used in its diagnosis, and to evaluate possible models of diagnosis for the causes found most frequently. One hundred twenty-eight (3.5%) of 3603 hospitalised HIV-positive patients evaluated from October 1992 to December 1993 had FUO, defined by established criteria. Eighty-six percent of patients with FUO had previously progressed to AIDS. The median CD4+ cell count was 46/mm3. A definite diagnosis was made in 96 (75%) of the 128 patients and a possible diagnosis in 24 (18.7%). whilst no diagnosis was made in eight cases (6.2%). Tuberculosis (48.3%), visceral leishmaniasis (16%), and infection by Mycobacterium avium complex (6.9%) were the diseases found most frequently. The most useful diagnostic tests were liver biopsy (68.9%) and bone marrow aspirate/biopsy (39.7%). It is not possible to predict clinically the cases of FUO due to tuberculosis, whilst thrombocytopaenia < 100,000 cells/mm3 alone is useful for differentiating the cases of visceral leishmaniasis, with a negative predictive value of 95.2%."
1259,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus(HBV) infection is one of the major global public health problems. Based on the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II), it is estimated that 1.25 million people are HBV infected in the United States. However, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans (APIAs) were underrepresented in this survey, and studies on the community HBV screening reported 6-15% of HBV infection in this special population. This article systematically reviews recent research advances in the possible barriers of hepatitis B care in APIAs that can be classified into three major categories, i.e., provider-, patient-, and resource-related barriers. The article also provides an overview of multiple approaches to effectively reduce these barriers so that we can evolve better strategy and deliver appropriate care to this special population and eventually reduce health disparity of CHB in APIAs."
4989,0.003,3.0,"The reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is a leading target in current antiretroviral therapy. Unfortunately, drug-resistant RT mutants evolve under the pressure of these drugs, and therefore, new anti-RT inhibitors are constantly required for HIV-1/AIDS treatment. We virtually screened a large chemical library of compounds against two crystal structures of HIV-1 RT to identify novel inhibitors. Top-scoring compounds were tested experimentally; 71 inhibited the RT-associated DNA polymerase, while several also inhibited HIV-1 pseudovirus infection in a cell-based assay. A combination of substituents from two structurally related inhibitors in a single molecule improved the inhibition efficacy. This compound strongly suppressed the RT-associated activity also protecting human lymphocytes from HIV-1 infection. RT inhibition by this compound was reversible and noncompetitive. This molecule and another structurally unrelated potent compound inhibited a known drug-resistant mutant of HIV-1 RT and affected moderately the HIV-2 RT-associated DNA polymerase. These inhibitors may serve as promising anti-HIV lead compounds."

3886,0.003,3.0,"Low-level viremia due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) was demonstrated in the sera of two patients diagnosed previously as having non-B, non-C chronic hepatitis. Both patients had a ""silent"" HBV infection, because they were negative for both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis B core antibody. The TaqMan chemistry polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified the HBV DNA, enabling quantitation of the virus in their sera. Their serum HBV DNA concentrations were low: the amount of each HBV S or X gene amplified showed there were approximately 10(3) copies/ml and HBV DNA was detected occasionally during clinical follow-up. Positive HBsAg staining in liver tissues was demonstrated by an immunoperoxidase technique. Vertical transmission of silent HBV from one patient to her daughter was confirmed. Direct nucleotide sequencing of the amplified HBV X region revealed several mutations, suggesting reduced viral replication. One patient had a T-to-C mutation at the extreme 5'-terminus of the direct repeat 2 region and the other exhibited a coexisting X region with a 155-nucleotide deletion. These findings suggest that HBV replication is suppressed considerably in patients with silent hepatitis B."
7205,0.003,3.0,"Previous studies have proved the presence of several distinct types of mutations in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections, which are related to the progression of liver disease. However, few reports have detailed the mutation frequencies and mutation patterns in the precore/core (preC/C) region, which are based on the clinical status and HBeAg serostatus. Our aim in this study is to investigate the relationships between the preC/C mutations and clinical severity or HBeAg serostatus from patients chronically infected with HBV genotype C. A total of 70 Korean chronic patients, including 35 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), participated in this study. HBV genotyping and precore/core mutations were analyzed by direct sequencing. All patients were confirmed to have genotype C infections. Mutations in the C region were distributed in a non-random manner. In particular, mutations in the MHC class II restricted region were found to be significantly related to HCC. Six (preC-W28*, C-P5H/L/T, C-E83D, C-I97F/L, C-L100I and C-Q182K/*) and seven types (preC-W28*, preC-G29D, C-D32N/H, C-E43K, C-P50A/H/Y, C-A131G/N/P and C-S181H/P) of mutations in the preC/C region were found to be related to HCC and to affect the HBeAg serostatus, respectively. In conclusion, our data indicated that HBV variants in the C region, particularly in the MHC class II restricted region, may contribute to the progress of HCC in chronic patients infected with genotype C. In addition, we found several distinct preC/C mutations in the Korean chronic cohort, which affect the clinical status of HCC and HBeAg serostatus of patients infected with genotype C."
9288,0.003,3.0,"Hepatocarcinogenesis is heavily influenced by chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) infection. Elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (SERPINE1/PAI-1) have been reported in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with viral infection. The gene encoding SERPINE1 is highly polymorphic and the frequently associated 4/5 guanosine (4G/5G) polymorphism in the gene promoter may influence its expression. Here, we investigated the distribution of genotypes and the frequency of alleles of the 4G/5G polymorphism in patients with HCC, the influence of the 4G/5G polymorphism on plasma SERPINE1 levels and its association with viral infection. A total of 75 patients with HCC were enrolled: 32 (42.6%) were HBV(+)/HCV(+), 11 (14.6%) were only HCV(+), and 32 (42.6%) were negative for both viruses. A control group of healthy donors was also enrolled (n=50). SERPINE1 plasma concentrations were determined by ELISA and the detection of the promoter 4G/5G polymorphism was performed by an allele-specific PCR analysis. We found that the frequency of both the 4G/4G genotype (p=0.02) and the 4G allele (p=0.006) were significantly higher in patients with HCC compared to the control group, and particularly higher in patients with HCC co-infected with HBV(+)/HCV(+) than in those with no viral infection. We also found that patients with the 4G/4G genotype had significantly higher plasma SERPINE1 protein levels when compared with patients with the 4G/5G or 5G/5G genotype (p<0.001). Differences in frequency of 4G allele and genetic variability of 4G/5G SERPINE1 polymorphism with a higher level of SERPINE1 protein in patients with HCC with HBV(+)/HCV(+) than those without infection, suggest the presence of two distinct pathogenic mechanisms in hepatocarcinogenesis, depending on the etiology."

7388,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection and biological sex may each affect response to antiretroviral therapy (ART), yet no studies have examined HIV-associated outcomes by both HCV status and sex. We conducted a cohort study of HIV-infected adults initiating ART in Kaiser Permanente California during 1996-2011. We used piecewise linear regression to assess CD4 changes by sex and HCV status over 5 years. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) by sex and HCV status for HIV RNA <500 copies/mL over 1 year, and for AIDS and death over the follow-up period. Among 12,865 subjects, there were 154 HIV/HCV-co-infected women, 1000 HIV/HCV-co-infected men, 1088 HIV-mono-infected women, and 10,623 HIV-mono-infected men. CD4 increases were slower in the first year for HIV/HCV-co-infected women (75 cells/μL) and men (70 cells/μL) compared with HIV-mono-infected women (145 cells/μL) and men (120 cells/μL; p<0.001). After 5 years, women had higher CD4 than men in both HIV-mono-infected (598 vs. 562 cells/μL, p=0.003) and HIV/HCV-co-infected individuals (567 vs. 509 cells/μL, p=0.003). Regardless of sex, HIV/HCV co-infection was associated with 40% higher mortality [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-1.6] compared with HIV mono-infection, but was not associated with AIDS (HR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.9-1.3) or achieving HIV RNA <500 copies/mL (HR 1.0, 95% CI: 0.9-1.1). HIV/HCV-co-infected men and women have slower CD4 recovery after starting ART and have increased mortality compared with HIV-mono-infected men and women. HCV should be aggressively treated in HIV/HCV-co-infected adults, regardless of sex."
4010,0.003,3.0,"Neurologic complications associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection vary geographically. To understand the pattern of HIV-associated neurologic complications in Mexico, 120 AIDS patients from Mexico City, Mexico, and 500 AIDS patients from Houston, Texas, were studied cross-sectionally and retrospectively. Neurologic, laboratory, imaging, and pathologic examinations identified 40 Mexican patients and 130 U.S. patients with neurologic complications. Whereas AIDS dementia complex was the most common neurologic manifestation in both groups, intracranial tuberculoma was present only in the Mexican population (10%). Primary brain lymphoma was more prevalent in the U.S. population (8.4%). The different findings in the Mexican population likely reflect afflictions common to developing countries--a high prevalence of tuberculosis and a high mortality rate. These conditions preclude complications such as lymphoma, which develop later in the natural course of HIV infection."
8792,0.003,3.0,"Infection due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 2 is believed to cause a clinical picture similar to that of HIV-1, although extensive data are not available. In 2 patients with West African exposure and neurologic symptoms, HIV-2 was detected in the central nervous system using DNA and RNA polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, and immunohistology. In the first patient, the neurologic disease was most likely due to productive infection with HIV-2. In the second, a combination of neuropathologic abnormalities (including the presence of HIV-2) explained the clinical features. Thus HIV-2, like HIV-1, can be readily detected in brain tissue in patients with neurologic abnormalities, although the exact role of HIV-2 in pathogenesis of AIDS-associated neurologic disease requires further study."
5840,0.003,3.0,"To determine the effects of hemophilia and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the nervous system, the authors examined the relationship of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings to immunologic function and neurologic examination findings. Baseline examinations included physical and neurologic examination, immunologic and virologic testing, and MRI of the brain. On neurologic examination, muscle atrophy was considered to be related to hemophilia if adjacent joints had arthropathy due to bleeding. Muscle atrophy was considered non-hemophilia-related if unrelated to arthropathy or if muscle atrophy was diffuse. Subjects were boys aged 6 to 19 years, enrolled in a multicenter study of the effects of hemophilia and HIV infection on growth and development, all with congenital coagulopathies requiring factor infusions. Three hundred ten subjects had complete data including neurologic examination, T-cell subsets, HIV antibodies, and MRI. Subjects with HIV infection whose CD4+ counts were < 200/microL were compared with subjects with HIV infection and CD4+ counts > or = 200/microL and with HIV-negative subjects, all of whom had CD4+ counts > 200/microL. MRI studies were normal in 230. Abnormal MRI studies were more frequent in HIV-positive subjects with CD4+ counts < 200 (29.4% abnormal compared with 17% in HIV-positive subjects with CD4+ counts > or = 200 and 15.3% in HIV-negative subjects). Diffuse atrophy accounted for most of the excess abnormalities in HIV-positive subjects with CD4+ counts < 200 (77.3% of abnormal scans). Diffuse atrophy on MRI was associated with decreased muscle bulk on neurologic examination, but not with abnormal tendon reflexes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3666,0.003,3.0,"Active TB in HIV-1-infected subjects is associated with increased HIV-1-related immunodeficiency and mortality. We assessed plasma viral load in HIV-1-infected patients with pulmonary TB (HIV/TB) and non-TB symptomatic HIV-1-infected patients (HIV). HIV-1 load was higher in HIV/TB compared with HIV at higher CD4 counts (> 500/microl) (P < 0.01), but not at lower CD4 counts (< 500/microl). We also evaluated the status of HIV-1 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum from HIV/TB and CD4-matched healthy HIV-infected patients (HIV/C) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction over a range of CD4 (> 900/microl to < 200/microl). HIV-1 RNA in serum and PBMC correlated to one another, and both were markedly higher in HIV/TB compared with HIV/C with higher CD4 counts. Also, during a longitudinal study of anti-tuberculous chemoprophylaxis in HIV-1-infected patients, 10 subjects who developed TB had serologies before, at the time, and after the diagnosis of TB. These HIV/TB patients had an increase in viral load (average 2.5-fold) at the time of diagnosis of TB (P < 0.05). Overall, these data indicate that the transcriptional activity of HIV-1 is enhanced in HIV-1-infected patients with active TB, especially during early HIV-1 disease. As TB often is an early HIV-1 opportunistic infection, it may particularly favour early viral replication and dissemination, and therefore contribute to progression of HIV-1 disease."
7668,0.003,3.0,"Tuberculosis (TB) enhances human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) activity in patients with dual HIV-1/TB infection. Therapies that control augmentations of HIV-1 activity at sites of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection may be useful in inhibition of viral expansion. Regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) analogues (AOP and NNY) are potent in inhibiting the entry of primary HIV-1 isolates into host mononuclear cells. These analogues were used to inhibit MTB-induced HIV-1 entry in blood monunuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with pulmonary TB, and pleural fluid mononuclear cells (PFMC) from patients with pleural TB. PBMC or PFMC were cultured with and without MTB in presence and absence of RANTES analogues. HIV-1 strong stop DNA was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a measure of infection. CCR5 mRNA was assessed by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and by immunostaining and FACS analysis. HIV-1 infection was induced by MTB in vitro in PBMC from the majority (14 of 20) of HIV-1/TB subjects, and new infection was inhibited by AOP- or NNY-RANTES. HIV-1 infection was also inhibited by these reagents in MTB-induced PFMC from three of three patients with pleural TB. Expression of CCR5 mRNA was significantly induced by MTB in PBMC from patients with pulmonary TB. Further, expression of CCR5 was higher in PFMC compared to PBMC from patients with pleural TB. Also, CCR5 was fourfold higher on CD14(+) pleural mononuclear cells than on CD4(+) lymphocytes. Blocking new HIV-1 infection of mononuclear cells may be useful in control of HIV-1 during dual HIV-1/TB infection."
3846,0.003,3.0,"Compromised oral health holds significant implications for the general health of medically vulnerable, HIV infected individuals. Past studies have reported that these individuals frequently suffer from oral opportunistic infections and have a tendency to develop severe periodontal disease. This study extends past research by examining the prevalence of oral infections according to patient characteristics and by reporting, for the first time, the level of perceived dental need in a large, multi-site sample of individuals with symptomatic HIV disease. Data for this study come from a survey of 857 clients of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's AIDS Health Services Program in 9 U.S. cities. More respondents (52%) reported a need for dental care than for any other service need. Multivariate analysis showed that clients who were white, in low-income groups, used intravenous drugs, or had a past history of oral opportunistic infections were more likely to report dental need. Relations between age, gender, insurance status, or disease status and perceived need were statistically nonsignificant. Forty-seven percent of the clients reported they had an oral opportunistic infection, the second outcome variable examined in this study. Statistically significant differences (P less than 0.05) were found in the prevalence of oral opportunistic infections among race and disease severity groups. Whites and the more severely ill were more likely to report an infection than their respective counterparts."
8178,0.003,3.0,"In the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART), liver disease has emerged as an important cause of death among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. The objective of this study was to estimate the burden of liver disease and evaluate determinants of liver fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity among HIV/HCV coinfected patients receiving ART. We studied 112 randomly selected and 98 referred HCV-infected patients undergoing care in the Johns Hopkins University HIV clinic. Liver disease was characterized clinically and histologically. Of the 210 individuals studied--64% of whom had received ART within 2 years of liver disease assessment--33% had no fibrosis (F0), and 26% had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (> or =F3). The median necroinflammatory activity score was 3 (range, 0-9 of 18). ART was not associated with fibrosis; however, significantly less hepatic necroinflammatory activity was observed among persons who had received highly active antiretroviral therapy longer (P = .02) and more effectively (defined by HIV RNA suppression; P < .01). Twelve percent of individuals had previous ART-associated liver enzyme elevations (grades 3-4), but liver fibrosis was not more severe if the liver enzyme elevation resolved. On the other hand, liver fibrosis was more severe in persons with persistent liver enzyme elevations (grades 1-4). In conclusion, despite widespread exposure to ART and documented instances of ART-related hepatitis, we found no evidence that ART caused serious histological liver disease. Recognition of bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis in some but not most patients underscores the importance of identifying and treating liver disease in HIV/HCV coinfected persons."

2353,0.003,3.0,"Although the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in a significant decrease of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) morbidity and mortality, the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia (HAD) has actually risen, due to the increasing life expectancy of the infected subjects. To date, several aspects of the HAD pathogenesis remain to be dissected. In particular, the viral-cellular protein interplay is still under investigation. Given their specific features, two viral proteins, Tat and Nef, have been mainly hypothesized to play a role in HIV neuropathology. Here we show that HIV-1 Nef has an effect on the transcriptional levels of a cellular protein, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), that is preferentially expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system at late embryonic stages. By its overexpression along with Nef, the authors demonstrate ALK ability to influence, at least in the U87MG astrocytic glioma cells, the mytogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-K)-dependent pathway. Moreover, although in the absence of a physical direct interaction, Nef and ALK activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are likely to contribute to blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage in HAD. Finally, in the in vitro model of glioblastoma cells adopted, Nef and ALK show similar effects by increasing different cytochines/chemokines that may be relevant for HAD pathogenesis. If confirmed in vivo, these data may indicate that, thanks to its ability to interfere with specific cellular pathways involved in BBB damage and in central nervous system (CNS) integrity, Nef, along with specific cellular counterparts, could be one of the viral players implicated in HAD development."

The burden of these viral infections in sub-Saharan Africa including Nigeria rely on estimates based on small population studies in some select populations. We present the report of a population survey in Nigeria during the period 2010-2012. A total of 5,558 adults participated in the screening exercise. The minimum age recorded was 18 years, while the maximum age was 75 years. The mean ± S.D. was 36.07 ± 8.76 years. The prevalence of hepatitis B (HBsAg) among the adults screened was determined to be 6.7% while that of hepatitis C (HCV) was 0.9%. The peak prevalence for HBsAg carriage was in the third to fourth decade in keeping with childhood acquisition while of HCV antibody was in the sixth to seventh decade. Male gender was significantly associated with HBsAg carriage while we noted a higher prevalence in those within the lower socioeconomic status. Overall our findings suggest that hepatitis B is endemic in Nigeria, much less than previously reported, while the prevalence for HCV is low although reports of pockets of high prevalence exist in select populations (hospital patients including those living with HIV)."

4809,0.003,3.0,"Mutations in the core protein (HBc) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are associated with aggressive hepatitis and advanced liver diseases in chronic hepatitis B (CHB). In this study, we identified the L60V variation in HBc that generates a new HLA-A2-restricted CD8(+) T cell epitope by screening an overlapping 9-mer peptide pool covering HBc and its variants. The nonameric epitope V60 was determined by structural and immunogenic analysis. The HBc L60V variation is correlated with hepatic necroinflammation and higher viral levels, and it may be associated with a poor prognosis in CHB patients. Immunization with the defined HBV epitope V60 peptide elicited specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-induced liver injury in HLA-A2(+) HBV transgenic mice. In addition, in vitro and in vivo experiments both demonstrated that the HBc L60V variation facilitates viral capsid assembly and increases HBV replication. These data suggest that the HBc L60V variation can impact both HBV replication and HBV-specific T cell responses. Therefore, our work provides further dissection of the impact of the HBc L60V variation, which orchestrates HBV replication, viral persistence, and immunopathogenesis during chronic viral infection.

9644,0.003,3.0,"Children born to women known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) before delivery were followed prospectively from birth in nineteen European centres. This analysis, encompassing the period end-December, 1984, to beginning-August, 1991, focuses on risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 infection. Rate of vertical transmission, based on 721 children born to 701 mothers more than 18 months before the time of analysis, was 14.4% (95% Cl 12.0-17.1%). Transmission was associated with maternal p24-antigenaemia and a CD4 count of less than 700/microliters. In a multivariate analysis, odds ratios of transmission were: 2.25 (95% Cl 0.97-5.23) in breastfed children vs never-breastfed children; 3.80 (1.62-8.91) in children born before 34 weeks' gestation; and 0.56 (0.30-1.04) in children delivered by caesarean section. Transmission was higher with vaginal deliveries in which episiotomy, scalp electrodes, forceps, or vacuum extractors were used, but only in centres where these procedures were not routine. On the basis of these results, HIV-infected women contemplating pregnancy should be counselled according to their immunological findings and, if they have p24-antigenaemia or a low CD4 count, warned of an increased risk of viral transmission. Caesarean deliveries may have a protective effect, although it is premature to recommend routine operative delivery. The mechanism for the higher infection rate in children born before 34 weeks' gestation is unclear, but could reflect inadequate passive or active immunity at that age, combined with substantial transmission during labour or delivery. The balance of evidence suggests that mothers with established infection can transmit HIV infection through breastmilk, although the relative importance of this route remains to be defined."
1401,0.003,3.0,"A prospective, case-control study was undertaken to characterise seizures occurring in the context of human immunodeficiency type-1 (HIV-1) infection. Fifty consecutive patients with a documented seizure were enrolled along with fifty control patients. Among cases the median CD4 cell count was 8/mm3 and 84% had a prior AIDS defining illness; 14/mm3 and 80% among the control group. Generalised seizures were seen in 84%, partial with secondary generalisation in 10% and partial in 6%. Associated conditions included cerebral toxoplasmosis (22%), cryptococcal meningitis (8%), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (6%), cytomegalovirus encephalitis (6%), central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (2%), and other causes (14%) including pre-HIV epilepsy. No associated condition was identified in 42% of patients of whom 18% were receiving foscarnet therapy at the time of seizure, compared with 4% of control patients (p < 0.001). Concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid â2-microglobulin and neopterin, markers that have been associated with HIV-1 involvement of the CNS, were elevated in 12/12 and 13/13 patients, respectively, of the group with no identifiable cause for their seizure. We conclude that seizures occur principally in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease, with opportunistic infections of the CNS the predominant underlying condition. In the group with no identifiable cause foscarnet therapy and subclinical HIV-1 involvement of the CNS may be factors responsible for seizure activity."
5073,0.003,3.0,"Despite the ability of current combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) to limit the progression of HIV-1 to AIDS, HIV-positive individuals continue to experience neuroHIV in the form of HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND), which can range from subtle to substantial neurocognitive impairment. NeuroHIV may also influence substance use, abuse, and dependence in HIV-positive individuals. Because of the nature of the virus, variables such as mental health co-morbidities make it difficult to study the interaction between HIV and substance abuse in human populations. Several rodent models have been developed in an attempt to study the transmission and pathogenesis of the HIV-1 virus. The HIV-1 transgenic (HIV-1Tg) rat is a reliable model of neuroHIV because it mimics the condition of HIV-infected patients on cART. Research using this model supports the hypothesis that the presence of HIV-1 viral proteins in the central nervous system increases the sensitivity and susceptibility of HIV-positive individuals to substance abuse.

7444,0.003,3.0,"The objective of this study was to assess the performance of 4 biologic tests designed to detect recent HIV-1 infections in estimating incidence in West Africa (BED, Vironostika, Avidity, and IDE-V3). These tests were assessed on a panel of 135 samples from 79 HIV-1-positive regular blood donors from Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, whose date of seroconversion was known (Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA et les Hépatites Virales 1220 cohort). The 135 samples included 26 from recently infected patients (< or =180 days), 94 from AIDS-free subjects with long-standing infection (>180 days), and 15 from patients with clinical AIDS. The performance of each assay in estimating HIV incidence was assessed through simulations. The modified commercial assays gave the best results for sensitivity (100% for both), and the IDE-V3 technique gave the best result for specificity (96.3%). In a context like Abidjan, with a 10% HIV-1 prevalence associated with a 1% annual incidence, the estimated test-specific annual incidence rates would be 1.2% (IDE-V3), 5.5% (Vironostika), 6.2% (BED), and 11.2% (Avidity). Most of the specimens falsely classified as incident cases were from patients infected for >180 days but <1 year. The authors conclude that none of the 4 methods could currently be used to estimate HIV-1 incidence routinely in Côte d'Ivoire but that further adaptations might enhance their accuracy."
5217,0.003,3.0,"Denmark is a country with low prevalence and incidence of blood borne viral infections. Among health care workers (HCWs) vaccination for hepatitis B is only offered to high-risk groups. The aims of this cross sectional survey were to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B, -C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among the staff at a Danish University hospital and to correlate this with risk factors for transmission. Additionally, we wanted to examine the current frequency of blood exposure, reporting habits and hepatitis B vaccination status in the staff. Of 1439 eligible hospital staffs included, 960 (67%) were HCWs. The overall human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-, hepatitis C Virus (HCV)- and hepatitis B Virus (HBV)-prevalence was 0% (0/1439), 0.14% (2/1439) and 1.6% (23/1439), respectively. Twenty-three percent of HCWs were vaccinated against HBV. Age, blood transfusion and stay in endemic areas were associated independently to HBV infection as opposed to job-category, duration of employment, HBV vaccination status and blood exposure. Based on a 4-week recall period, the incidence of percutaneous blood exposure was 1.5/person-year. In conclusion the HIV and hepatitis prevalence was low despite frequent blood exposure and the principal risk factors were unrelated to work. Danish HCWs do not seem to be at increased risk of hepatitis B even though universal HBV vaccination has not been implemented."
5794,0.003,3.0,"Despite advances in the treatment of HIV disease, the incidence and mortality of invasive cryptococcal disease remain significant. A matched, case-control study was performed to examine the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and azole use on the incidence of invasive cryptococcal disease in HIV-infected patients. The study was performed at a metropolitan hospital with a large indigent population and an incidence of seven cases of cryptococcal disease per 1000 persons with AIDS. Bivariate analysis, matched on CD4 count, revealed that both HAART use [odds ratio (OR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-0.99] and azole use (OR 0.14; 95% CI 0.06-0.34) had a protective effect. Conditional logistic regression stratified on CD4 lymphocyte count revealed a protective role for azole use (OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.06-0.40) but not for HAART use (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.18-1.26). Of note, the prevalence of HAART use was low in both cases and controls, with only 12% of cases and 23% of controls on HAART. The results of this study support previous evidence that azole use prevents invasive cryptococcal disease. Although current guidelines for the prophylaxis of opportunistic infections do not suggest routine prophylaxis for cryptococcal infection, this issue should be reconsidered, especially in populations that have a low prevalence of HAART use."
1433,0.003,3.0,"Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a possible treatment for acute or chronic liver failure due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but reinfection of the graft can be a serious complication. The aim of this study was to monitor HBV markers, to analyse pre-core-/core-mutations as well as to identify the viral population causing reinfection after OLT, and to investigate the emergence or disappearance of these mutants in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment. Fifty-four pre-and posttransplant serum samples of 17 patients were analysed. All patients underwent OLT for HBV-related liver disease and had HBV-DNA before and after OLT. Total DNA was extracted from all sera and a 240 bp fragment comprising the pre-core region of HBV was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Pre-core mutants of HBV were determined by direct sequencing of these PCR products and by sequencing of PCR clones. Eight of 17 patients were infected with pre-core wildtype HBV before OLT (group A). Seven of eight patients of group A were reinfected by pre-core wildtype HBV after OLT. In one of eight patients in addition to wildtype HBV a mutant strain (nt. 1899 G-->A) was detected. Nine of 17 patients were infected with pre-core mutant HBV before OLT (group B). Six of nine patients of group B were reinfected with the same mutant population; in one, an additional pre-core mutation emerged; two patients lost pre-core mutant HBV (nt. 1896 and 1899 G-->A). In one of the latter two, a pre-core start-codon mutant (nt. 1816 G-->T), not detectable before OLT, emerged, in the other a nt. 1897 G-->A stop-codon mutant persisted. Five patients of each group were followed-up for more than 24 (25 to 58) months on immunosuppressive therapy. In all five patients of group A, pre-core wildtype of HBV persisted during long-term follow up. Two of five patients of group B were infected stably with a stop-codon HBV-mutant nt. 1896. In three patients, the nt. 1896 stop-codon mutant disappeared during immunosuppressive therapy. However, in one of the latter three, an HBV stop-codon mutant nt. 1897 persisted. In conclusion, most patients who underwent OLT for HBV-related disease were reinfected with the same virus population that existed before OLT. In rare cases, new mutants emerged after OLT or preexisting mutants were lost. During long-term follow-up on immunosuppressive therapy, in the majority of patients pre-core mutants disappeared and wildtype HBV became the predominant virus strain."
1931,0.003,3.0,"The factors that predispose patients undergoing liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus (HBV) disease to severe recurrence of infection are unclear. In this study we examined the effect of pretransplantation infection with HBV and precore variant strains of HBV on posttransplantation outcome and allograft histology in 24 patients who survived more than 3 months after liver transplantation. Based on pretransplantation serum HBV DNA status as detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing, the 24 patients could be assigned to three groups. In group 1 there were 4 patients HBV DNA-negative before transplantation and none of these patients suffered recurrence of infection posttransplantation. In group 2, of 10 patients with pretransplantation infection with wild-type virus, 7 became reinfected, and 1 of these developed HBV-related graft failure. In group 3, 9 of 10 patients infected with precore mutant HBV strains became reinfected. However, in contrast to the patients in group 2, 7 patients in group 3 developed HBV-related graft loss, and 5 of these patients had fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (FCH). These results indicate that infection with precore mutant strains of HBV predisposes a patient to early graft loss following transplantation."
1028,0.003,3.0,"The purpose of the audit was to assess the implementation of the protocols developed by Lothian University National Health Service Trust for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) against blood-borne virus infections. Patients at risk of infection after an injury were referred to the Department of Genitourinary Medicine (GUM) Edinburgh Royal Infirmary for assessment. A brief description of the incident, the time of the incident, the time of referral and the decision made was documented. The notes of these patients were reviewed 12 months later for the results of prospective HIV test after each incident. There were 76 referrals to the GUM Department in year 2001. Occupational Health (OH) and the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Departments each made 35 referrals. The latter cases were exposures in community settings. Amongst A&E referrals the time interval between the incident and assessment was significantly longer than for OH referrals (P=0.001). Female health workers reported exposure incidents sooner than their male counterparts (P=0.01). Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV was offered to 22 (29%) of 76 referred individuals, and was accepted by 13 (59%) persons. The course of PEP drugs was discontinued by five (38%) of the 13 individuals after consented post-incident HIV testing of the source patients showed that they were HIV-seronegative. Five of eight individuals completed the course of PEP medication. Only 11 (14%) persons attended for serological testing for blood-borne virus infection three or more months after exposure. None of these 11 persons, one of whom had been given PEP medication, had become infected. Further training and emphasis on the necessity of immediate reporting of occupational incidents and consented post-incident HIV testing of the source patient is needed. The current guidelines appear to work fairly well, but further counselling of those with significant injuries to undertake HIV serological testing after appropriate time interval is required."
197,0.003,3.0,"Clarifying the relationship between illicit drug use and HIV-1 virologic suppression requires characterization of both illicit drug use activity and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We developed a rapid clinical questionnaire to assess prior 7-day illicit drug use and ART adherence in a cross-sectional study among 1777 HIV-infected persons in care. Of these, 76% were male, 35% were African-American, and 8% reported injection drug use as their probable route of HIV-1 infection. Questionnaire-reported frequencies of cocaine and marijuana use within the previous 7 days were 3.3% and 12.1%, respectively. Over three quarters (77.8%) of participants were on ART, of whom 69.7% had HIV-1 virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA<48 copies/mL). Univariate analyses revealed that compared to no use, cocaine and marijuana use were both associated with missed ART doses (P<0.01). Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for nonadherence demonstrated that cocaine use was independently associated with failing to achieve virologic suppression (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.46; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.22-0.98) but marijuana use was not (aOR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.72-1.62). This result strengthens the evidence of a direct effect of cocaine on virologic control, independent of nonadherence to ART."
4089,0.003,3.0,"In transient gene expression assays we observed an increase in expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) gene, under the transcriptional control of the HIV-1 LTR (pLTR-CAT), when this plasmid was cotransfected into Vero or MRC-5 cells with a plasmid containing either the HCMV immediate early 1 and 2 (E1, IE2) genes (pRL43a) or just the IE2 gene (pMP18). When the HCMV IE1 gene (pMP12) was cotransfected with pLTR-CAT into Vero cells the level of measurable CAT gene activity was below the level observed when pLTR-CAT was cotransfected with a nonspecific carrier plasmid (pGEM3). The negative influence of the HCMV IE1 gene product on the HIV-1 LTR in Vero cells was also observed when the HIV-1 tat gene (pLTR-TAT) was contransfected into Vero cells with pLTR-CAT and pMP12. However, when the HCMV IE1 gene was cotransfected into rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells with proviral HIV-1 DNA, an increase in viral production, as monitored by measurement of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity, was observed. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, nuclear extracts obtained 15 hr post-HCMV infection (hpi) were found to contain a lower level of interaction with an oligonucleotide which corresponded to the HIV-1 LTR Sp-1 binding motif. Nuclear extracts obtained 40 hpi of MRC-5 cells had a greater level of interaction with, and changed the mobility of, the Sp-1 oligonucleotide relative to the uninfected nuclear extracts. HCMV-infected MRC-5 cell nuclear extracts also contain a factor(s) which interacted with the HIV-1 LTR between nucleotide positions -15 to -2 relative to the HIV-1 mRNA start site."
237,0.003,3.0,"Here, we found that a 6-mer peptide, Poly6, derived from the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which overlaps with a polymerase corresponding to a preS1 deletion reported to contribute to liver disease progression, can elicit an antiviral effect against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 by inhibiting HIV-1 integrase (IN) activity of infected cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that the anti-HIV-1 effects of Poly6 occurred via the inhibition of integration, which resulted from the inhibition of acetylation of HIV-1 IN possibly by downregulation of p300 histone acetyltransferase. Our data suggest the potential therapeutic use of a 6-mer HBV-derived peptide, Poly6, as an anti-HIV-1 agent to suppress HIV-1 infection via inhibiting integrase activity."
7220,0.003,3.0,"The development of multidrug-resistant viruses compromises the efficacy of anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) therapy and limits treatment options. Therefore, new targets that can be used to develop novel antiviral agents need to be identified. One such target is the interaction between Vpr, one of the accessory gene products of HIV-1 and Importin alpha, which is crucial, not only for the nuclear import of Vpr, but also for HIV-1 replication in macrophages. We have identified a potential parent compound, hematoxylin, which suppresses Vpr-Importin alpha interaction, thereby inhibiting HIV-1 replication in a Vpr-dependent manner. Analysis by real-time PCR demonstrated that hematoxylin specifically inhibited nuclear import step of pre-integration complex. Thus, hematoxylin is a new anti-HIV-1 inhibitor that targets the nuclear import of HIV-1 via the Vpr-Importin alpha interaction, suggesting that a specific inhibitor of the interaction between viral protein and the cellular factor may provide a new strategy for HIV-1 therapy."

Over the past decade, new information on the clinical manifestation, natural history, treatment options, and related toxicity have been reported, mostly notably the integration of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The following is a concise review summarizing the current state-of-the-art for GI tract malignancies in the HIV-positive patient and is designed to assist the clinical oncology team in developing a rationale plan when caring for these patients."
2003,0.003,3.0,"The ability of HIV-1 to evolve resistance to antiretroviral drugs leads to treatment failure. By nucleotide sequencing of HIV-1 subtype B isolates, amino acids responsible for drug resistance have been identified. Less information is available, however, on the extent and distribution of these amino acids in HIV-1 nonsubtype B viruses circulating mainly in developing countries. More HIV-infected patients in the developing world are now using antiretroviral drugs, and hence there is a need to monitor drug resistance mutations in HIV-1 non-subtype B viruses. This study examines the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in 28 antiretroviral drug-naive HIV-1-infected Zambians. HIV-1 proviral DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The region encompassing gag p17 to env C2-V3-C3 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing. Sequence analyses for drug resistance-associated mutations in th e protease and reverse transcriptase genes, and HIV-1 subtyping, were done. Overall, 92.8% of the generated sequences were HIV-1 subtype C. The generated sequences revealed only secondary associated, but no primary, drug-resistance mutations The most frequent secondary mutations in the protease and RT genes were, respectively, I93L(91.7%), L89M (79.2%), M3611V (79%, 4.2%), and R211K (70.8%), S48T (62.5%). The atypical residues M41N (3.6%) and D67A (3.6%) were detected in the RT gene. This study reveals many naturally occurring polymorphisms in HIV-1 subtype C isolates from antiretroviral drug-naive individuals. Such polymorphisms could lead to rapid treatment failure and development of drug-resistant HIV-1 mutants in individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy."
1839,0.003,3.0,"The membrane-spanning domain (MSD) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 glycoprotein is critical for its biological activity. Previous C-terminal truncation studies have predicted an almost invariant core structure of 12 amino acid residues flanked by basic amino acids in the HIV-1 MSD that function to anchor the glycoprotein in the lipid bilayer. To further understand the role of specific amino acids within the MSD core, we initially replaced the core region with 12 leucine residues and then constructed recovery-of-function mutants in which specific amino acid residues (including a GGXXG motif) were reintroduced. We show here that conservation of the MSD core sequence is not required for normal expression, processing, intracellular transport, and incorporation into virions of the envelope glycoprotein (Env). However, the amino acid composition of the MSD core does influence the ability of Env to mediate cell-cell fusion and plays a critical role in the infectivity of HIV-1. Replacement of conserved amino acid residues with leucine blocked virus-to-cell fusion and subsequent viral entry into target cells. This restriction could not be released by C-terminal truncation of the gp41 glycoprotein. These studies imply that the highly conserved core residues of the HIV Env MSD, in addition to serving as a membrane anchor, play an important role in mediating membrane fusion during viral entry."
9592,0.003,3.0,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have been identified as cofactors of HIV transmission. Greater understanding of local STI burdens can assist in the development of more effective STI and HIV prevention strategies. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and incidence of STIs among South Indian men and women identified to be at increased risk for HIV infection. Individuals at increased risk for HIV infection were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal study in Chennai, India (n = 480) between August 2002 and December 2003. Participants were enrolled from patients seeking services at an sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic and a confidential HIV testing and counseling program. The most common prevalent STIs were herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 (50% of women, 29% of men), syphilis (11% of women, 8% of men), and Trichomonas vaginalis (6% of women). At enrollment, women, participants with no schooling, participants with greater than four sex partners, and single participants were found to be at increased risk for HSV-2 infection (p < 0.05). The two most common incident STIs at 12 months were HSV-2 with 12% of men and 8% of women testing positive and hepatitis B with 2% of men and 5% of women testing hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. In this cohort of South Indian men and women with a high background prevalence of HSV-2, suppressive therapy against herpes replication may have a substantial impact in reducing both HSV-2 transmission and HIV acquisition. With the high incidence of STIs, targeted prevention and clinical management strategies among individuals practicing high risk behaviors may help to slow the continued spread of HIV in India."
5865,0.003,3.0,"Haemophilic patients exposed to unsterilized clotting factor concentrates prior to 1985 have become infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). We have studied the sequence evolution of the 5'UTR and a region of NS4 over 12 years in one human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive haemophilic patient and 14 years for one HIV negative haemophilic patient. One sample each year from the date of HCV infection to 1994 was analysed for genotype, virus load and nucleotide sequence of the two genetic loci. Both patients were infected with HCV genotype 1 throughout the study period. The virus load profiles were similar except that the profile for the HIV infected patient was displaced 4 years earlier relative to the other patient. Mean divergence of the quasispecies at both the 5'UTR and NS4 loci was higher in the HIV coinfected patient. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that evolution of the 5'UTR was host independent, whereas the NS4 region containing a CD8 restricted CTL epitope evolved in a host specific fashion."

113,0.003,3.0,"Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) may lead to subclinical, acute or chronic hepatitis. In the prevaccination era, HBV infections were endemic due to frequent mother to child transmission in large regions of the world. However, there are still estimated 240 million chronic HBV carriers today and ca. 620,000 patients die per year due to HBV-related liver diseases. Recommended treatment of chronic hepatitis B with interferon-α and/or nucleos(t)ide analogues does not lead to satisfactory results. Induction of HBV-specific T cells by therapeutic vaccination or immunomodulation may be an innovative strategy to overcome virus persistence. Vaccination with commercially available HBV vaccines in patients with or without therapeutic reduction of viral load did not result in effective immune control of HBV infection, suggesting that combination of antiviral treatment with new formulations of therapeutic vaccines is needed. The woodchuck (Marmota monax) and its HBV-like woodchuck hepatitis virus are a useful preclinical animal model for developing new therapeutic approaches in chronic hepadnaviral infections. Several innovative approaches combining antiviral treatments using nucleos(t)ide analogues, with prime-boost vaccination using DNA vaccines, new hepadnaviral antigens or recombinant adenoviral vectors were tested in the woodchuck model. In this review, we summarize these encouraging results obtained with these therapeutic vaccines. In addition, we present potential innovations in immunostimulatory strategies by blocking the interaction of the inhibitory programmed death receptor 1 with its ligand in this animal model. "
7773,0.003,3.0,"Fever of unknown origin (FUO) poses a major diagnostic challenge in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this retrospective study, we sought to assess the clinical utility of percutaneous liver biopsy as a diagnostic aid for FUO in HIV-infected patients and identify the factors associated with a greater likelihood of a positive diagnostic yield form this procedure. A total of 101 HIV-infected patients with FUO, who had undergone percutaneous liver biopsy in an HIV care hospital, served as the study population. The results obtained from percutaneous liver biopsy were categorized into three groups: (i) diagnostic, (ii) helpful, and (iii) not helpful. Diagnostic and helpful results were classified as useful. The mean (SD) age of patients was 37.6 (6.9) years, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) CD4 count was 18 (3-62) cells/mm(3). The median (IQR) duration of fever was 20 (8-30) days. Percutaneous liver biopsy was diagnostic in 51 patients (50.5%), helpful in 12 (11.9%) and not helpful in 38 (37.6%) patients. On multivariate analyses, elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase level (OR 1.27 per one time elevation from the upper normal range; 95% CI, 1.03-1.57; P = 0.023), and fever duration of less than 3 weeks (OR 3.82; 95% CI, 1.03-14.18; P = 0.046) was significantly associated with the likelihood of the biopsy findings being classified as useful. Our study supports the case for percutaneous liver biopsy as a useful diagnostic aid in HIV-infected patients with FUO. "
2441,0.003,3.0,"The association between risk behaviors and hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been extensively studied. It is also proved that impulsivity is associated with risk behaviors. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the association between HCV and impulsivity, a characteristic that can contribute directly to these risk behaviors. This study aimed to investigate HCV-infected individuals' impulsivity and whether this feature mediates risk behavior. Adult patients with liver diseases (n=269) were divided into two groups: viral group (n=157) - patients with HCV and nonviral group (n=112). Risk behaviors were evaluated by a sociodemographic questionnaire. Impulsivity was assessed through Barratt Impulsiveness Scale - BIS-11. Psychiatric comorbidities were investigated by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0.0. The viral group patients had higher impulsivity than the nonviral group in all domains: attentional impulsivity, motor impulsivity, and nonplanning. Risk behaviors were also shown to be associated with impulsivity levels. Our results suggest that HCV-infected patients are more impulsive than individuals with other liver diseases, even when analyses are controlled for the presence of comorbid mental disorders. In addition, at-risk behavior was significantly mediated by impulsivity."
6536,0.003,3.0,"The prospective, multisite human immunodeficiency (HIV) Epidemiology Research Study was established to define the biologic, psychologic, and social effects of HIV infection on the health of US women. From 1993 to 1995, a total of 871 HIV-infected women and 439 demographically matched, uninfected women aged 16-55 years, half of whom reported injection drug use and half of whom reported only sexual risk behaviors, were recruited in four US cities. Two sites recruited primarily from medical/drug therapy care settings, and two recruited from community sources. Women consented to biannual interviews; physical examination; blood, urine, and cervicovaginal specimen collection and repository; laboratory assays; and abstraction of outpatient and inpatient medical records to document HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related diagnoses. Retention was greater than 88% at the third 6-month follow-up. Lower retention was associated with currently injecting drugs, not having dependent children, and not being infected with HIV at enrollment. In addition to the core study, a variety of nested studies are under way, some in collaboration with other HIV cohorts and various Public Health Service agencies. This cohort is distinct from other HIV longitudinal cohorts in the diversity of its participants and the comprehensive range of measures to study prospectively the biomedical, social, and emotional effects of the HIV epidemic on infected women and those whose behavior puts them at high risk of infection."
2567,0.003,3.0,"In an attempt to understand the structural reasons for differences in specificity and activity of proteinases from two retroviruses encoded by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and myeloblastosis associated virus (MAV), we mutated five key residues predicted to form part of the enzyme subsites S1, S2 and S3 in the substrate binding cleft of the wild-type MAV proteinase wMAV PR. These were changed to the residues occupying a similar or identical position in the HIV-1 enzyme. The resultant mutated MAV proteinase (mMAV PR) exhibits increased enzymatic activity, altered substrate specificity, a substantially changed pH activity profile and a higher pH stability close to that observed in the HIV-1 PR. This dramatic alteration of MAV PR activity achieved by site-directed mutagenesis suggests that we have identified the amino acid residues contributing substantially to the differences between MAV and HIV-1 proteinases."
4620,0.003,3.0,"We studied human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection incidence over time in a 16-center cohort of hemophiliacs in the United States and Europe and estimated the most likely date of seroconversion for all seropositive subjects. Five U.S. centers enrolled subjects independent of HIV-1 status, whereas 11 centers preferentially included seropositive subjects. We obtained unbiased estimates of HIV-1 infection incidence rates from the five centers and estimated dates of seroconversion from the distribution seen among seropositives from all centers. In the five-center cohort, infection incidence began in 1978, peaked in October 1982 at 22 infections per 100 person-years at risk, and declined to 4 per 100 person-years by July 1984. Few infections occurred after 1987, and by that time, 50% of the cohort had become infected. Median seroconversion dates for subgroups of all seropositives ranged from July 1980 to December 1983, depending on the dose and type of factor concentrate. Median dates in Europe ranged from September 1981 to March 1983 and reflected the use of products manufactured from American plasma. Infection incidence apparently peaked about the same time that public health interventions were introduced to reduce transmission. These interventions, including heat treatment of factor concentrates and deferral of high-risk donors, have prevented HIV-1 infection from becoming endemic among younger birth cohorts of persons with hemophilia."
7310,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) encodes a gene product, Vpr, that facilitates the nuclear uptake of the viral pre-integration complex in non-dividing cells and causes infected cells to arrest in the G(2) phase of the cell cycle. Vpr was also shown to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in human cells and budding yeasts, an effect that was proposed to lead to growth arrest and cell killing in budding yeasts and apoptosis in human cells. In this study, we used a genetic selection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify hexameric peptides that suppress the growth arrest phenotype mediated by Vpr. Fifteen selected glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused peptides were found to overcome to different extents Vpr-mediated growth arrest. Amino acid analysis of the inhibitory peptide sequences revealed the conservation of a di-tryptophan (diW) motif. DiW-containing GST-peptides interacted with Vpr in GST pull-down assays, and their level of interaction correlated with their ability to overcome Vpr-mediated growth arrest. Importantly, Vpr-binding GST-peptides were also found to alleviate Vpr-mediated apoptosis and G(2) arrest in HIV-1-producing CD4(+) T cell lines. Furthermore, they co-localized with Vpr and interfered with its nuclear translocation. Overall, this study defines a class of diW-containing peptides that inhibit HIV-1 Vpr biological activities most likely by interacting with Vpr and interfering with critical protein interactions."
9181,0.003,3.0,"A total of 390 parenteral drug abusers (PDAs) at the Kaohsiung Municipal Narcotics Abstention Institute were examined for markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). All sera were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), surface antibody (anti-HBs), and core antibody (anti-HBc) by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and for antibody to HIV (anti-HIV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and antibody to HDV (anti-HDV) were also tested for HBsAg-positive serum samples. Although the HBsAg-positive rate (22.1%) among PDAs was similar to that of the general population in southern Taiwan, the HBV infection rate (99.2%) and the anti-HDV-positive rate (78.5%) among HBsAg-positive subjects were significantly higher than those of the general population in southern Taiwan (P less than 0.0001). None of the PDAs studied were positive for anti-HIV. The levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) among PDAs were significantly higher than those of the general population in southern Taiwan (P less than 0.0001). The more frequent the institutionalisation, the higher the infection rates with HBV and HDV and elevated levels of SGOT and SGPT. Horizontal transmission through parenteral drug abuse may be considered a possible reason for the significantly higher rates of HBV and HDV among parenteral drug abusers."
5235,0.003,3.0,"Few patients with osteonecrosis that complicates human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been reported. We describe 5 patients whose symptoms of osteonecrosis developed with viral suppression and improvement in CD4 lymphocyte counts as a result of antiretroviral therapy. In addition, we review previously reported cases. The mean patient age was 35 years, and HIV was the sole risk factor in only 33%. Eighteen patients (55%) were receiving antiretroviral treatment when osteonecrosis was diagnosed. For 16 patients whose CD4 lymphocyte counts were reported, the mean CD4 count was 350 cells/mm(3). In 10 of these patients, the occurrence or worsening of symptoms of osteonecrosis appeared to be related to successful antiretroviral therapy. We conclude that osteonecrosis is an emerging manifestation of HIV infection and that it may be either a consequence of immunologic and virologic improvement resulting from antiretroviral therapy or a complication caused by the drugs themselves."

Epidemiological and clinical data for 158 patients with acute HBV infection from 22 medical centres in the period February 2001 to February 2002 were collected prospectively. HBV genotyping was based on analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms and nested PCR. There were 59 female and 99 male patients, with a mean age of 34.2 +/- 15.6 years. The most common probable transmission route was blood contact in 63 (41.1%) cases, but was unknown in 78 (49.4%) cases. The mean alanine aminotransferase level was 1718 +/- 1089 IU/L. Four of the 158 patients (2.5%) died because of fulminant hepatitis. One year after discharge, 11 (10.6%) of 103 cases were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 80 (77.7%) were positive for anti-HBsAg. Genotype determination was unsuccessful in 11 cases because of a negative PCR; genotype D was found in the remaining 147 cases. The results suggested that acute HBV infection constitutes a significant health problem in Turkey and that genotype D is predominant."
5710,0.003,3.0,Clinical measures of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 activity in vivo are limited and hinder the assessment of antiretroviral therapies. Reported here is a method for quantitating HIV-1 RNA in human plasma using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This method uses an internal cRNA standard generated from a cloned 113-bp deletion mutation of a highly conserved HIV-1 gag region sequence. The mutant cRNA (K4) was shown to amplify with efficiency equivalent to that of wild-type HIV-1. Known quantities of K4 cRNA added to wild-type HIV-1 in a competitive PCR strategy using a radiolabeled primer permitted quantitation of wild-type HIV-1 RNA over four orders of magnitude (10(3)-10(6) RNA copies). RNA isolated from plasma from AIDS patients yielded 10(3) to 8 x 10(4) HIV-1 RNA copies/ml of plasma with an average intrasample coefficient of variation of .26. This method offers a sensitive assay with a broad dynamic range for monitoring HIV-1 activity in the plasma of AIDS patients. It may provide a useful tool for assessing the effects of antiretroviral therapy.
6136,0.003,3.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. In type 2 diabetes (T2D), use of insulin and statins was associated with reduced cancer risk while co-presence of low LDL cholesterol (LDLC <2.8 mmol/l) plus low triglyceride (TG; <1.7 mmol/l) increased cancer risk. There is experimental evidence showing that insulin insufficiency might promote HCC. In this study, we examined whether this lipid subphenotype and use of insulin or statins might modify the promoting effect of chronic HBV infection (indicated by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen) on HCC. We analyzed data of 1319 T2D patients enrolled into the Hong Kong Diabetes Registry from December 1996 to January 2005 and followed up to 2005. Additive interaction was estimated using relative excess risk due to interaction and attributable proportion due to interaction. During 5782 person-years of follow-up, 1.74% (n=23) of patients developed HCC (incidence, 3.98; 95% confidence interval, 2.36-5.60/1000 person-years). HbA1c ≥7.0% and the lipid phenotype (LDLC <2.8 mmol/l plus TG <1.7 mmol/l) increased the hazard ratios (HRs) of chronic HBV infection for HCC from 3.74 to 74.96 and from 11.01 to 89.82 respectively with significant interactions. Use of insulin or statins decreased the HRs from 37.51 to 5.87 and from 64.94 to 16.99 respectively with significant interactions (all P values <0.05). These findings support our hypothesis that hyperglycemia and co-presence of low LDLC plus low TG might enhance, while insulin or statin usage might attenuate the promoting effect of chronic HBV infection on HCC in T2D."
4941,0.003,3.0,"Outcomes of chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) are varied, with increased morbidity reported in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. The factors driving different outcomes are not well understood, but there is increasing interest in an HLA class I effect. We therefore studied the influence of HLA class I on HBV in an African HIV-positive cohort. We demonstrated that virologic markers of HBV disease activity (hepatitis B e antigen status or HBV DNA level) are associated with HLA-A genotype. This finding supports the role of the CD8(+) T-cell response in HBV control, and potentially informs future therapeutic T-cell vaccine strategies. "
671,0.003,3.0,"To evaluate whether frank or subtle disorders of adrenal steroidogenesis exist in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children, the adrenal steroid response to an iv bolus of ACTH-(1-24) (0.25 mg Cortrosyn) was determined. Ten children (six males and four females, aged 7 months to 7.5 yr) were studied. Five underwent repeat testing 3-5 months after initial assessment. Nine patients were classified as P2 or symptomatic according to the Center for Disease Control criteria for HIV infection in children. Eight had failure to thrive, six had opportunistic infections and neurological deficits, and two were receiving ketoconazole at the time of ACTH testing. Only one patient had a neonatally acquired transfusion-related HIV infection. Three of the children died 2-5 months after ACTH testing. All patients had normal or slightly elevated baseline and stimulated cortisol levels compared to the control population. The mean post-ACTH cortisol level was significantly higher than the mean post-ACTH level in the control population. No patient demonstrated an impaired aldosterone response to ACTH. The basal and ACTH-stimulated dehydroepiandrosterone levels were normal. Although individual deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone levels were variable, the mean stimulated deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone levels in the patients were suggestive of a selective defect of the 17-desoxy pathway in the adrenal fasciculata. No changes were noted in the patients' cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, and aldosterone responses on repeat ACTH testing. In HIV-infected children we have demonstrated that cortisol and aldosterone synthesis is intact. Thus, the chronic debilitation observed cannot be explained on the basis of adrenal insufficiency. However, a selective deficiency of 17-desoxysteroid hormone production from the adrenal fasciculata may be present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5119,0.003,3.0,"Liver transplantation has evolved as the therapy of choice in end-stage liver disease. However, liver transplantation for viral liver disease is associated with recurrence of viral hepatitis in the graft. In this paper we discuss the mechanisms of liver cell damage, the clinical impact of recurrent infection and the use of hepatitis-B-specific immunoglobulin (HBIg) to prevent recurrent infection in the allograft. In addition, we propose an HBIg schedule tailored to each individual patient. Based on the excellent survival results published for acute hepatic failure and chronic liver failure with latent hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis delta infection, we think that no contraindication exists for liver transplantation in these cases. For patients with active viral replication, liver transplantation should only be considered within a scientific frame to prevent reinfection of the allograft."
2021,0.003,3.0,"The effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy on cytokine imbalances associated with HIV-1 infection have not been characterized. Using single cell analysis by flow cytometry, we show that a significant recovery in the frequency of IL-2-producing cells was only observed in patients with a sustained control of viral replication and that the overexpanded CD8 T cell population of CD28- IFN-gamma + cells was not significantly reduced after 1 yr of effective therapy. Moreover, a detrimental role of IL-4 is suggested by the association between an enhanced proportion of IL-4-producing cells within the CD4 and particularly the CD8 subset and viral load rebound. Finally, the kinetics of changes of cell subsets assessed for simultaneous production of different cytokines supports the view that cell reconstitution during highly active antiretroviral therapy is initially due to redistribution of terminally differentiated cells, followed by peripheral expansion of less differentiated ones and a late progressive increase of the proportion of functionally defined naive/memory precursor lymphocytes. These data bring new support for the role of cytokine imbalances in AIDS pathogenesis and may be relevant for the definition of immunointervention targets."
6143,0.003,3.0,"The effectiveness of isolation measures to prevent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in hemodialysis units is a controversial issue. Strict adherence to the universal infection control precautions has been deemed adequate to prevent nosocomial transmission of HCV. Subsequently, however, select isolation measures, such as the clustering of HCV positive patients in a defined sector of the unit, have been adopted, specially for those units with a high HCV prevalence and when the personnel-patient ratio was such that it could involuntary favor the break of the universal precautions. In this Multicenter Spanish Study on HCV in Dialysis, the importance of both time and isolation measures led to a decrease of HCV prevalence. Time was the most important factor (although interacting with the isolation measures) and was independent of the initial HCV prevalence."

The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the anti retroviral therapy 157 patients receiving antiretroviral treatment for at least a twelve month-period and presenting AIDS symptoms based on revised CDC criteria were included. The average number of initial T4 lymphocytes is 133/mm3 (extremes 1 and 385) and the initial plasmatic average viral load, quantified in 96 patients is 214,000 copies (extreme 30,000 et 999,000) The initial antiretroviral combinations were as follows: ZDV or D4T + LMV + NVP (59.2%); ZDV or D4T + LMV + EFV (28.7%), ZDV or D4T + LMV + IDNV (8.9%); ZDV or D4T + DDI + NVP (3.2%). The results of the study are: observance rate during the first 12 months (84%), antiretroviral therapy taken irregularly (10.8%), early submission of therapy (5.2%), weight gain after 24 months: +18 kgs, clinical response globally positive. The immune response is characterised by an average increase of 353/mm3 of CD4 after 24 months. Among 96 patients tested, the plasmatic viral load was undetectable in 71% of cases after a 12 month-follow up. Mild adverse drug effects have been noticed, represented by cutaneous and nervous toxicity anaemia and digestive disorders due to indinavir These therapeutic results confirm the importance of the antiretroviral therapy in the improvement of the quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients but a concern remains on the possible drug resistance still not documented."

5014,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 drug-resistance testing is quickly moving from the research laboratory to the clinic as data defining its utility as a prognostic indicator of response to therapy become available. In July 1998, a panel of the International AIDS Society-USA did not recommend the widespread application of resistance testing, but by May 2000 this panel endorsed and recommended the incorporation of resistance testing in patient-care management. Considerable data supporting the use of drug-resistance testing have now been published or presented at international conferences. These data strongly suggest that drug-resistance testing is of considerable value in many clinical settings. Prospective trials of resistance testing as a clinical management tool are still ongoing, and the long-term benefits still need to be evaluated. Nevertheless, early results from several studies showed a significantly better virological response when treatment regimens were based on resistance-testing data, rather than on the standard of care. HIV drug-resistance testing is also useful as a tool for new antiretroviral drug design and development, as well as for monitoring the spread of primary HIV drug resistance."
5414,0.003,3.0,"Exposure to childhood religious affiliations where the majority of members discourage homosexuality may have negative psychological impacts for Black men who have sex with men. This study tested the hypothesis that exposures to these environments during childhood were associated with adulthood human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/sexually transmitted infection (STI) behavioral risk and HIV infection, because these exposures influenced HIV/STI risk by undermining race/sexual identity congruence and increasing internalized homophobia and interpersonal anxiety. Structural equation modeling as well as logistic and Poisson regressions were performed using baseline data from HIV Prevention Trials Network 061 ( N = 1,553). Childhood religion affiliations that were more discouraging of homosexuality were associated with increased likelihood of HIV infection; however, the association was no longer significant after adjusting for age, income, and education. Having a childhood religion affiliation with high prevalence of beliefs discouraging homosexuality was associated with increased numbers of sexual partners (adjusted odds ratio = 4.31; 95% confidence interval [3.76, 4.94], p < .01). The hypothesized path model was largely supported and accounted for 37% of the variance in HIV infection; however, interpersonal anxiety was not associated with HIV/STI risk behaviors. Structural interventions are needed that focus on developing affirming theologies in religious institutions with Black men who have sex with men congregants."
8275,0.003,3.0,"Using lookback procedures and other methods, we identified and then prospectively followed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected transfusion recipients and their sex partners to determine AIDS incidence and risks of heterosexual transmission of HIV-1. At enrollment, 7 of 32 (21.9%) female partners of male recipients were themselves infected with HIV-1, as compared with none of 14 male partners of female recipients (p = 0.08). No additional episodes of transmission were observed. The prevalence of advanced immunodeficiency at enrollment was similar in male and female recipients. Male recipients with advanced immunodeficiency (CD4+ lymphocyte count < or = 0.20 x 10(9)/L or a history of clinical AIDS) at enrollment were more likely to have infected their female partners (odds ratio = 7.9; p = 0.03) than men with neither condition. Similarly, AIDS-free survival, as estimated by the product-limit method, was lower among male transmitters than among male nontransmitters (p = 0.01). Transmission was not associated with frequency of unprotected vaginal intercourse. Our data suggest that HIV-1-infected men who develop immunodeficiency rapidly are more likely to infect their sex partners and that the greater efficiency of male-to-female HIV-1 transmission is not explained by a greater number of sexual contacts or more advanced immunodeficiency in index subjects."
3224,0.003,3.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection could cause severe liver disease including cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver failure in HIV-positive individuals. The available data from clinical studies suggest that HIV infection modulates the HBV-specific T cell response. However, the virological and molecular aspects of HIV-HBV coinfection are currently poorly understood due to the lack of appropriate model systems. In this study, the effect of HIV infection on the life cycle of HBV was explored using an in vitro model system. The present data show that the extracellular and intracellular hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and e antigen (HBeAg) decrease significantly in HepG2 cells cotransfected with HIV NL4-3 and pHBV1.3 as compared to those cells transfected only with pHBV1.3. Moreover, a significant decrease in HBV DNA and mRNA expression was also observed in the cotransfected cells. HIV Rev protein, an RNA-bound regulatory protein, could significantly decrease the expression levels of extracellular and intracellular HBsAg and HBeAg by mediating the expression of HBV mRNA in cells cotransfected with plasmids containing HIV-1 Rev and pHBV1.3. Further experiments demonstrate that HIV Rev manipulated neither the promoters of HBV nor the nuclear export of HBV mRNA. These results from the in vitro model system might provide clues to further understand the rapid progression of liver disease in HIV-HBV-coinfected patients."

5227,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is capable of infiltrating the brain and infecting brain cells. In the years following HIV infection, patients show signs of various levels of neurocognitive problems termed HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Although the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has reduced the incidence of HIV-dementia, which is the most severe form of HAND, the milder forms have become more prevalent today due to the increased life expectancy of infected individuals. Pre-HAART era markers such as HIV RNA level, CD4+ count, TNF-α, MCP-1 and M-CSF are not able to clearly distinguish mild from advanced HAND. One promising approach for new biomarker discovery is the identification and quantitation of proteins that are post-translationally modified by oxidative and nitrosative species. The occurrence of oxidative and nitrosative stress in HIV-infected brain, both through the early direct and indirect effects of viral proteins and through the later effect on mitochondrial integrity during apoptosis, is well-established. This review will focus on how the reactive species are produced in the brain after HIV infection, the specific oxidative and nitrosative species that are involved in the post-translational modification of the brain proteome, and the methods that are currently used for the detection of such modified proteins. This review also provides an overview of related research pertaining to oxidative stress-related HAND using cerebrospinal fluid and human brain tissue. "

2057,0.003,3.0,"After the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), several studies have shown a decrease in the prevalence of HIV-associated oral lesions. The goal of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of oral manifestations of HIV in Brazil. A retrospective epidemiologic analysis was performed of medical records of HIV-positive patients who attended Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital and the Stomatology Clinic of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro from 1988 to 2004. Gender, age, mode of HIV transmission, level of education, history of opportunistic infections, smoking, CD4 counts, viral load, antiretroviral therapy, and presence and site of oral lesions were assessed. One thousand twelve medical records were reviewed, resulting in 1230 entries in the study's database: 920 men and 310 women. There was a positive correlation between the prevalence of women, patients older than 40 years of age, and patients with 11 years or less of education. HAART was associated with a lower prevalence of oral manifestations. The prevalence of oral manifestations decreased throughout the years, while an increase occurred in the prevalence of oral warts and HIV-associated salivary gland disease (SGD). This study implies a social trend of AIDS in Brazil with an increase in the number of females, people 40 years of age and older, and with lower educational background. In Brazil, it can also be observed a reduction in the prevalence of oral manifestations reported worldwide and an increase in the prevalence of oral warts and SGD. To our knowledge, no study of this time frame has been done in a Brazilian population."

Screening of the most prevalent tropical diseases (intestinal parasitosis, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, malaria, schistosomiasis, and strongyloidiasis) was performed according to geographic origin. A total of 190 patients were included: 141 (74.2%) from Latin America, 41 (21.6%) from sub-Saharan Africa, and 8 (4.2%) from northern Africa. Overall, 36.8% (70 of 190) of the patients had at least one positive result for any parasitic disease: 5 patients with positive Trypanosoma cruzi serology, 11 patients with positive Schistosoma mansoni serology, 35 patients with positive Strongyloides stercoralis serology, 7 patients with positive Leishmania infantum serology, intestinal parasitosis were detected in 37 patients, malaria was diagnosed in one symptomatic patient.

3763,0.003,3.0,"The objective of this study was to assess the analytical and clinical relevance of minority variants using a new pyrosequencing (PSQ) assay and to detect minor variants with frequencies below the current 20% clinical setting limit. A PSQ approach for detecting and quantifying mutations was developed for the analysis of 14 codons of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) gene below the limit of conventional sequencing. Ten patients who experienced virological failure (VF) after a first-line regimen of lamivudine, tenofovir, and either efavirenz, nevirapine, or etravirine, as well as 10 controls patients without VF, were included in this retrospective study. Baseline plasma and plasma from the time of VF were assessed using Sanger sequencing and PSQ methods. The analytical sensitivity for the detection of minor sequence variants is 5%. At baseline, no minority variant was detected in 10/10 patient controls using both the Sanger sequencing and PSQ assays, whereas, two patients who failed therapy had baseline non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations that were not detected by the standard genotyping. At the time of VF, standard genotyping detected mutations in four out of the 10 VF patients, whereas, PSQ detected mutations in five out of the 10 VF patients. Clinically, minority mutations at a 10% level of detection can be assessed efficiently by pyrosequencing and used as a suitable predictor of the evolution of viral populations. These traits allow for a better interpretation of data analysis, which can help clinicians in providing a suitable treatment for HIV."

In this study, the genotype frequency of two IL28B SNPs (rs129679860 and rs8099917) in a cohort of chronic HCV-monoinfected patients in Brazil was evaluated and the SNP sufficient to predict the treatment response outcome was determined. A total of 66 naïve genotype-1 chronic HCV-infected patients were genotyped and the associated viral kinetics and SVR were assessed. The overall SVR was 38%. Both the viral kinetics and SVR were associated with rs129679860 genotypes (CC = 62% vs. CT = 33% vs. TT = 18%, p = 0.016). However, rs8099917 genotypes were only associated with SVR (TT = 53% vs. TG = 33% vs. GG = 18%; p = 0.032).

8919,0.003,3.0,"A subset of HIV-1-infected patients undergoing antiretroviral treatment develops a lipodystrophy syndrome. It is characterized by loss of peripheral subcutaneous adipose tissue (face, limbs, buttocks), visceral fat accumulation, and, in some cases, lipomatosis, especially in the dorsocervical area. In addition, these patients show metabolic alterations reminiscent of the metabolic syndrome, particularly dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. These alterations lead to enhanced cardiovascular risk in patients and favor the development of diabetes. Although a complex combination of HIV-1 infection and drug treatment-related events triggers the syndrome, lipotoxicity appears to contribute to the development of the syndrome. Active lipolysis in subcutaneous fat, combined with impaired fat storage capacity in the subcutaneous depot, drive ectopic deposition of lipids, either in the visceral depot or in nonadipose sites. Both hepatic steatosis and increased lipid content in skeletal muscle take place and surely contribute to systemic metabolic alterations, especially insulin resistance. Pancreatic function may also be affected by the exposure to high levels of fatty acids; together with direct effects of antiretroviral drugs, this may contribute to impaired insulin release and a prodiabetic state in the patients. Addressing lipotoxicity as a pathogenic actor in the lipodystrophy syndrome should be considered in strategies for treating and/or preventing the morphological alterations and systemic metabolic disturbances associated with lipodystrophy."

For 3,175 persons followed > or = 6 months after AIDS, we also examined the change between the year before AIDS diagnosis and the 6 months afterward in the predominant provider who was seen most frequently and at least twice. Approximately 75% of the population had a predominant provider identified. Of this group, 43% of the patients had a generalist as their predominant provider before AIDS diagnosis, falling to only 25% after diagnosis. The proportion with an AIDS specialist predominant provider increased from 22% before AIDS diagnosis to 39% afterward (P < 0.001). Patients with a generalist predominant provider before AIDS diagnosis had higher odds of switching providers and of hospitalization after AIDS diagnosis than patients with an AIDS specialist predominant provider.

This occurred in the context of a new diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The initiation of anti-retroviral therapy and subsequent restoration of CD4 counts was associated with an increase in the number of lesions. Histopathologic examination of representative tumors showed basal-cell carcinomas, which lead to the diagnosis of eruptive basal-cell carcinomas in the setting of HIV-related immunosuppression.

Two matched HIV-1-positive/HTLV-2-negative controls for each coinfected individual were also enrolled in the study. HTLV-2 infection was found in 95 (8.2%) of the HIV-1-positive patients, 30 of whom were followed up for a median of 28.5 months. No significant differences were observed between them and the patients infected with HIV-1 alone in terms of the rate of decline in CD4 cell counts, progression to AIDS, or AIDS mortality, but they had an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (hazard ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-8.0; p =.009). One coinfected patient developed myelopathy during the follow-up. In the second part of the study, aimed at preliminarily assessing the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the incidence of peripheral neuropathy, we extended our observations to two groups of coinfected and singly infected individuals receiving HAART. An 80% decrease in incidence of peripheral neuropathy was observed among both groups without any significant difference between them. These results support the hypothesis that HTLV-2 plays a role in the development of neurologic abnormalities in HIV-1-infected patients and suggest that the immune reconstitution due to HAART may limit the activity of HTLV-2 as an opportunistic agent."

The aims of this study were to determine adherence to NUCs and factors associated with NUC adherence and to correlate NUC adherence with the occurrence of virological breakthroughs in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving NUC were asked to complete a survey every 3 months. Adherence was also assessed by healthcare providers in the clinic. Adherence rate was defined as the per cent of days the patients took their hepatitis B virus medications during the last 30 days. A total of 111 patients were studied. The mean age was 47.7 years, 73.9% were men, 57.7% were Asian, 42.3% had postgraduate education and 80% had private insurance. Sixty-nine (74.1%) patients reported 100% adherence in the survey, while 78 (83.9%) reported 100% adherence to their healthcare providers. Patients with 100% adherence based on the survey were older (P = 0.02), more likely to be men (P = 0.006), and had higher annual household income (P = 0.04) than those with <100% adherence. In the 80 patients who completed three surveys, viral breakthrough was observed in 1/46 (2.2%) with 100% adherence on all three surveys, 1/18 (5.6%) with <100% adherence on one survey and 3/16 (18.8%) with <100% adherence on ≥2 surveys, (P = 0.06). In conclusion, adherence to NUC therapy in our patients with chronic hepatitis B was high but self-reporting of adherence to healthcare providers may be inflated. Patients with chronic hepatitis B with better adherence to NUC therapy had a trend towards a lower rate of viral breakthroughs."

We describe the case of a 45-year-old woman with HIV/HCV coinfection, irritable bowel syndrome, and accelerated progression of coronary atherosclerosis after execution of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this case, the rapidity of progression of atherosclerosis seems linked principally to chronic inflammation and excess immune activation that can depend by a concourse of factors (chronic C hepatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, PCI execution) not directly associated with traditional risk factors. Caregivers following HIV-infected patients should be aware of the increased risk of accelerated atherogenesis in these subjects, principally in case of presence of causes of intense immune activation."
5157,0.003,3.0,"Most studies on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication kinetics or fitness must rely on a particular assay to initially standardize inocula from virus stocks. The most accurate measure of infectious HIV-1 titers involves a limiting dilution-infection assay and a calculation of the dose required for 50% infectivity of susceptible cells in tissue culture (TCID(50)). Surrogate assays are now commonly used to measure the amount of p24 capsid, the endogenous reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, or the amount of viral genomic RNA in virus particles. However, a direct comparison of these surrogate assays and actual infectious HIV-1 titers from TCID(50) assays has not been performed with even the most conserved laboratory strains, let alone the highly divergent primary HIV-1 isolates of different subtypes. This study indicates that endogenous RT activity, not p24 content or viral RNA load, is the best surrogate measure of infectious HIV-1 titer in both cell-free supernatants and viruses purified on sucrose cushions. Sequence variation between HIV-1 subtypes did not appear to affect the function or activity of the RT enzyme in this endogenous assay but did affect the detection of p24 capsid by both enzyme immunoassays and Western blots. Clear groupings of non-syncytium-inducing (NSI), CCR5-tropic (R5), and SI/CXCR4-tropic (X4) HIV-1 isolates were observed when we compared the slopes derived from correlations of RT activity with infectious titers. Finally, the replication efficiency or fitness of both the NSI/R5 and SI/X4 HIV-1 isolates was not linked to the titers of the virus stocks."

Outcomes in the current management era are unknown. This is a prospective series of liver or kidney transplant recipients with stable HIV disease. Eleven liver and 18 kidney transplant recipients were followed for a median of 3.4 years (IQR [interquartile range] 2.9-4.9). One- and 3-year liver recipients' survival was 91% and 64%, respectively; kidney recipients' survival was 94%. One- and 3-year liver graft survival was 82% and 64%, respectively; kidney graft survival was 83%. Kidney patient and graft survival were similar to the general transplant population, while liver survival was similar to the older population, based on 1999-2004 transplants in the national database. CD4+ T-cell counts and HIV RNA levels were stable; and there were two opportunistic infections (OI). The 1- and 3-year cumulative incidence (95% confidence intervals [CI]) of rejection episodes for kidney recipients was 52% (28-75%) and 70% (48-92%), respectively. Two-thirds of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients, but no patient with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, recurred. Good transplant and HIV-related outcomes among kidney transplant recipients, and reasonable outcomes among liver recipients suggest that transplantation is an option for selected HIV-infected patients cared for at centers with adequate expertise."

However, some contrasting evidence exists in the literature with regard to commonly reported risk factors. In this study, we investigated whether the known risk factors for FIV and FeLV infections have a stronger effect for either infection. This retrospective study included samples from 696 cats seropositive for FIV and 593 cats seropositive for FeLV from the United States and Canada. Data were collected during two cross sectional studies, where cats were tested using IDEXX FIV/FeLV ELISA kits. To compare the effect of known risk factors for FIV infection compared to FeLV, using a case-case study design, random intercept logistic regression models were fit including cats' age, sex, neuter status, outdoor exposure, health status and type of testing facility as independent variables. A random intercept for testing facility was included to account for clustering expected in testing practices at the individual clinics and shelters."

HBe antigen and HBV DNA, during the last trimester of their pregnancy. The patients included in this study were French (n = 1,295 (67.3 per cent] and immigrant women (n = 628 (32.7 per cent] attending consultation in four public Parisian suburb hospitals. The immigrant population was composed of natives of the Mediterranean area or Portugal (64 per cent), West Africa (23 per cent), and South-East Asia (13 per cent). Serum HBsAg was tested by conventional radioimmunoassay. When present, HBeAg and antiHBe were tested by radioimmunoassay, and HBV DNA by the hybridization procedure. The overall HBsAg prevalence was 1.56 per cent. This high prevalence was in part explained by the large proportion of immigrants in whom it varied from 0.8 to 7.5 per cent according to their origin. Prevalence was 0.85 per cent in French women, higher than that usually admitted in France. Serological markers of viral replication (HBeAg and/or HBV-DNA) were more often present in the immigrants (4 out of 19) than in the French women (1 out of 11). Discrepancies between HBe status and HBV DNA were present in 4 out of the 30 HBs antigen positive women. Due to the possible high prevalence of HBV carriage in pregnant women, routine antenatal HBs antigen screening should be recommended in France. Such screening, associated with immunoprophylaxis of newborns at risk of contamination, can help in the prevention of perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus."

Anti-HIV was negative in all the cases, that obtained from our results compared with the general adult population from peruvian coast are high. In relation to the information obtained, the transmission route would be diverse, considering an important one the sexual route. 44 drug addicts were seen in 1988 at this Hospital, 36 cases could be a representative number, although we think we need to extend this study to a bigger population to establish the actual prevalence of this infection among these particular patients.

8259,0.003,3.0,"Our study objective was to determine the current use of liver biopsy in chronic viral hepatitis and how patient management is affected by the procedure. Members of the Italian Association of Hospital Gastroenterologists were asked to complete a questionnaire for patients submitted to biopsy. Their clinical diagnosis was compared with the histological diagnosis. Of 660 patients evaluated, we selected 535 cases with viral infection. Concordance of clinical vs histologic diagnosis amounted to 84.3%, with 92.7% sensitivity and 32.4% specificity rates for diagnosing chronic hepatitis; the clinical diagnosis was correct in only 24 of 57 cases with cirrhosis. In 20 cases (3.7%) additional diagnoses were provided. The biopsy was rated avoidable in 36.8% of cases. Knowledge about grading and staging was considered of value in 59.6 and 66.4% of cases, respectively; however, when it became available, the scheduled treatment with interferon was not changed in 81.7 and 80.9% of cases. In the majority of patients with abnormal ALT and infection with HCV and/or HBV, histology documents mild/moderate inflammation with minimal fibrosis and liver biopsy neither increases the accuracy of clinical diagnosis nor affects the choice of therapy. The data from this study support the view that liver biopsies are less helpful than conventionally understood."
3901,0.003,3.0,"Infants born to HIV-1-infected mothers in resource-limited areas where replacement feeding is unsafe and impractical are repeatedly exposed to HIV-1 throughout breastfeeding. Despite this, the majority of infants do not contract HIV-1 postnatally, even in the absence of maternal antiretroviral therapy. This suggests that immune factors in breast milk of HIV-1-infected mothers help to limit vertical transmission. We compared the HIV-1 envelope-specific breast milk and plasma antibody responses of clade C HIV-1-infected postnatally transmitting and nontransmitting mothers in the control arm of the Malawi-based Breastfeeding Antiretrovirals and Nutrition Study using multivariable logistic regression modeling. We found no association between milk or plasma neutralization activity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or HIV-1 envelope-specific IgG responses and postnatal transmission risk. While the envelope-specific breast milk and plasma IgA responses also did not reach significance in predicting postnatal transmission risk in the primary model after correction for multiple comparisons, subsequent exploratory analysis using two distinct assay methodologies demonstrated that the magnitudes of breast milk total and secretory IgA responses against a consensus HIV-1 envelope gp140 (B.con env03) were associated with reduced postnatal transmission risk. These results suggest a protective role for mucosal HIV-1 envelope-specific IgA responses in the context of postnatal virus transmission. This finding supports further investigations into the mechanisms by which mucosal IgA reduces risk of HIV-1 transmission via breast milk and into immune interventions aimed at enhancing this response."
5143,0.003,3.0,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) nearby the IL28B gene have been associated with spontaneous hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance and response to interferon-based therapies in both monoinfected and HIV-coinfected patients. However, its impact on spontaneous clearance of HBV (the pathogenesis of which is also related to interferon) is less known. A case-control study was performed. Cases were 49 HIV(+) patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBsAg(+) for more than 6 months) who had been genotyped for the rs12979860 SNP (protective CC genotype). One control for each case was chosen among HIV patients with anti-HBs and anti-HBc. Controls were matched for gender and coinfection with HCV. Most patients were male (90%) and the median (IQR) age was 42.6 (39-46.7) years. Eighteen (36.7%) were also coinfected by HCV. Among HBsAg(+) patients, 19 (41.3%) were HBeAg(+) and 13 (26.5%) were also infected with hepatitis delta (HDV). No differences were found in the distribution of the CC genotype between patients with chronic hepatitis B and those who spontaneously cured hepatitis B: 59.2% vs. 44.9%; p=0.3. Thus, the interleukin-28B (IL-28B) genotype does not seem to have a role in the development of chronic hepatitis B among HIV-infected patients."
1916,0.003,3.0,"Entecavir (ETV) is a potent antiviral nucleoside analogue that is used to treat hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that ETV is also active against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Unlike all approved nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase RT) inhibitors (NRTIs), ETV contains a 3'-hydroxyl group that allows further nucleotide incorporation events to occur. Thus, the mechanism of inhibition probably differs from classic chain termination. Here, we show that the incorporated ETV-monophosphate (MP) can interfere with three distinct stages of DNA synthesis. First, incorporation of the next nucleotide at position n + 1 following ETV-MP is compromised, although DNA synthesis eventually continues. Second, strong pausing at position n + 3 suggests a long range effect, referred to as ""delayed chain-termination."" Third, the incorporated ETV-MP can also act as a ""base pair confounder"" during synthesis of the second DNA strand, when the RT enzyme needs to pass the inhibitor in the template. Enzyme kinetics revealed that delayed chain termination is the dominant mechanism of action. High resolution foot-printing experiments suggest that the incorporated ETV-MP ""repels"" the 3'-end of the primer from the active site of HIV-1 RT, which, in turn, diminishes incorporation of the natural nucleotide substrate at position n + 4. Most importantly, delayed chain termination protects ETV-MP from phosphorolytic excision, which represents a major resistance mechanism for approved NRTIs. Collectively, these findings provide a rationale and important tools for the development of novel, more potent delayed chain terminators as anti-HIV agents."

Despite calls to address childbearing for PLHA there has been limited attention to developing safe conception programs. This research sought to assess the childbearing desires of PLHA and the experiences of health care providers serving this population. Research entailed a brief cross-sectional client survey given to HIV-infected men and women over age 18 at two Los Angeles County clinics administered over an 8-week period. Focus group discussions were conducted with providers at each clinic site. Although 39% of the 93 clients surveyed reported a desire to have children, two-thirds of clients had not discussed their desires, or methods of safe conception, with providers. Providers reported challenges in providing safe conception services in resource poor settings where clients cannot afford assisted fertility services and in the absence of national, state, or county guidelines for safe conception. They noted complex and varied client circumstances and a critical need for provider training in safe conception. Guidelines that focus on safe conception and harm reduction strategies as well as the legal ramifications of counseling on these practices are needed. HIV providers need training and patients need educational tools and workshops informing them of the risks, challenges, and options available to them and their partners to safely conceive and bear an HIV-negative child."

7765,0.003,3.0,"Primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes, supporting in vitro human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication, are destined to die by apoptosis. We explored the initial molecular events that act upstream from mitochondrial dysfunction in CD4(+) T lymphocytes exposed to the HIV-1(LAI) strain. We tracked by immunofluorescence the cells expressing the p24 viral antigen and used Percoll density gradients to isolate a nonapoptotic CD4(+) T-cell subset with a high inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) but no outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) rupture. In most p24(+) (but not bystander p24(-)) cells of this subset, the lysosomes were undergoing limited membrane permeabilization, allowing the lysosomal efflux of cathepsins (Cat) to the cytosol. This was also induced by HIV-1 isolates from infected patients. Using pepstatin A to inhibit Cat-D enzymatic activity and Cat-D small interfering RNA to silence the Cat-D gene, we demonstrate that once released into the cytosol, Cat-D induces the conformational change of Bax and its insertion into the OMM. Inhibition of Cat-D activity/expression also conferred a transient survival advantage upon productively HIV-1-infected cells, indicating that Cat-D is an early death factor. The transfection of activated CD4(+) T lymphocytes with a Nef expression vector rapidly induced the permeabilization of lysosomes and the release of Cat-D, with these two events preceding OMM rupture. These results reveal a previously undocumented mechanism in which Nef acts as an internal cytopathic factor and strongly suggest that this viral protein may behave similarly in the context of productive HIV-1 infection in CD4(+) T lymphocytes."

Treatment failure with this regimen has become more common. A second regimen needs to be prepared for the Thai national program. Genotypic resistance testing was conducted among HIV-1 infected children who experienced virological failure with antiretroviral therapy (ART) using NNRTI-based regimens. Patterns of resistance mutations were studied and options for a second regimen were determined. There were 21 patients with a median (IQR) age of 4.1 (1.9-7.7) years. Sixteen patients were males. The median CD4 cell count and HIV-1 RNA at the time of virological failure were 647 cells/mm3 and 5.3 log copies/ml, respectively. The prevalences of patients with > or =1 major mutation conferring resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs were 52% and 43%, respectively. Thymidine analoque mutations, M184V/I, and Q151M were observed in 38%, 33%, and 5%. The patterns of resistance mutations suggest that 48% of patients need a protease inhibitor-based regimen for the second regimen and didanosine+lamivudine is the most required nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone."
4660,0.003,3.0,Hepatitis C virus-related liver disease and its associated complications are steadily emerging health concerns in persons co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The increasing number of liver-related deaths in human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis C virus co-infected individuals supports the compelling argument for more aggressive treatment in these patients. The safety and efficacy of interferon/ribavirin in human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus co-infected patients is currently under evaluation. Despite well-documented concern over highly active antiretroviral therapy-associated hepatotoxicity human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus co-infected patients should be offered antiretroviral therapy. Since management of co-infected patients is complex a multidisciplinary approach is needed in order to facilitate care and help patients to achieve a positive outcome.

The male homosexual population constituted some 7% (8,175) of the total, 94% of whom were white; however, this probably represented a substantial underestimation of the size of this population. A total of 1,475,223 carriers of HBV virus was calculated for South Africa from data obtained from 1986 to 1990. Of these, 88% (1,302,741) came from the rural black population and 8% (114,118) from the urban black population. Extrapolations from small sample numbers and often with broad assumptions are subject to considerable error.

436,0.003,3.0,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a naturally occurring free radical with many functions. The oxidized form of NO, the nitrosonium ion, reacts with the thiol group of cysteine residues resulting in their modification to S-nitrosothiols. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (HIV-PR) has two cysteine residues that are conserved amongst different viral isolates found in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In an active dimer, these residues are located near the surface of the protease. We have found that treatment of HIV-PR with different NO congeners results in loss of its proteolytic activity and simultaneous formation of S-nitrosothiols. Sodium nitroprusside inhibited HIV-PR up to 70% and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine completely inhibited the protease within 5 min of treatment. The pattern of inhibition by NO donors is comparable to its inhibition by N-acetyl pepstatin. Using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, we identified the modification of HIV-PR by NO as that of S-nitrosation. Our findings point towards a possible role of NO in mediating resistance to HIV-1 infection."

Five hundred sixty-six of 1315 trauma patients (43%) were tested. Two of the 566 patients (0.35%) were HIV positive. A review of aggregate data for HIV infection among rural trauma patients in the United States show that 28 of the 4639 patients (0.60%) are HIV positive. We conclude that there was a low HIV incidence among our trauma patients from September 1994 to November 1995, and the cost-effectiveness of HIV testing for rural trauma patients is questionable with incidences between 0.5 and 1.0 per cent."
3183,0.003,3.0,"In 2004, KwaZulu-Natal initiated one of the world's largest HIV/AIDS treatment programs. Studies in South Africa have shown that patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) develop rapidly and transmit drug resistant mutations. Since resistance testing is not widely available in Kwazulu-Natal, the Department of Health conducted the first HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) threshold survey in 2005, which did not identify any mutations associated with HIVDR. The objective of this study was to conduct a follow-up threshold survey to update the information on HIVDR. This study was conducted in 2009 in five antenatal care sites in Kwazulu-Natal using the HIVDR threshold survey method developed by WHO. Two hundred and thirteen newly-diagnosed HIV positive, drug-naïve primigravidae, less than 22 years of age were included in the survey. Of the 82 HIV positive specimens, 17 had insufficient volume for genotyping and, of the remaining 65, 47 were genotyped sequentially. Drug resistance was identified by sequencing the HIV-1 pol gene, using the ViroSeq® HIV-1 genotyping system v2.0. Of the 47 samples that were genotyped, only one presented with a K103N mutation, which equates to a prevalence of transmitted HIVDR of <5%. The low prevalence of transmitted HIVDR is in keeping with statistical models of the early stages of ART rollout. As ART coverage is increasing continuously, there is a need to ensure that vigilance of HIVDR continues so that the emergence and spread of HIVDR is minimized."
139,0.003,3.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virulence factor Nef enhances viral infectivity in single-cycle infection assays and accelerates HIV-1 replication in vitro. It has been reported that the effects of Nef are mediated early after viral entry and before the completion of reverse transcription, as viral DNA synthesis is strongly attenuated during infection by Nef-defective virions. Our previous work has demonstrated that Nef is associated with mature HIV-1 cores, implicating Nef in the regulation of HIV-1 core stability. Here we report a comparative analysis of HIV-1 cores isolated from wild-type and Nef-defective particles. We observed no effect of Nef on HIV-1 core structure or stability; however, Nef cosedimented with a subviral ribonucleoprotein complex following dissociation of CA. These results indicate that Nef interacts tightly with an internal component of the HIV-1 core. They further suggest that virion-associated Nef may facilitate an early step in HIV-1 infection following dissociation of the viral capsid in the target cell."

The authors conducted a national survey using online social media to examine cell phone and Internet use, self-reported HIV viral load (detectable vs. undetectable), and antiretroviral adherence rating (excellent vs. less than excellent). Participants (N = 1,494) were asked about their Internet use for health care engagement purposes (including e-mailing health care providers, refilling medications online, and making medical appointments online). Approximately 95% of participants accessed the Internet nearly daily or daily in the past month (mean hours on Internet use per day = 5.2) and 55.5% used the Internet for health care engagement purposes. Those who used the Internet for any health care engagement purposes had a 1.52-fold odds of reporting an undetectable viral load (p = .009) and a 1.49-fold odds of reporting excellent adherence (p = .001). Although Internet access and use were similar across racial/ethnic, educational, and socioeconomic groups, disparities existed with the use of the Internet for health care engagement purposes among racial/ethnic minorities, those with low to moderate financial stability, lower education, and history of incarceration. The authors' data reveal that among HIV-positive users of online social media, use of the Internet for health care engagement purposes is associated with better self-reported virologic and adherence outcomes."

Transferring human CD4(+) T cells containing the IFN-beta retroviral vector drastically reduced the preexisting HIV infection and enhanced CD4(+) T-cell survival and Th1 cytokine expression. Furthermore, in 40% of the Hu-PBL-SCID mice engrafted with IFN-beta-transduced CD4(+) T cells, HIV-1 was undetectable in vivo as well as after cocultivation of mouse tissues with human phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphoblasts. These results indicate that a therapeutic strategy based upon IFN-beta transduction of CD4(+) T cells may be an approach to controlling a preexisting HIV infection and allowing immune restoration."

HIV seroprevalence in STD clinics ranged from 0 to 38.5% (median, 2.3%), with the highest rates found in the Mid-Atlantic states, Florida, and Puerto Rico. The highest median rates were found in men who have sex with men (36.1%) and heterosexual intravenous (IV) drug users (4.1%). For heterosexual persons who do not report IV drug use, median rates were highest in the 35- to 39-year-old age group for men (6.4%) and the 30- to 34-year-old age group for women (0.9%). Among persons who do not report risk behaviors for HIV infection, men had substantially higher median rates of HIV infection than women (P less than 0.001, Wilcoxon Signed Rank test), and rates were positively correlated with HIV infection rates in IV drug users in the same clinic (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] = 0.8; P less than 0.001). Among heterosexual STD clinic patients who do not report IV drug use, the median HIV infection rate for blacks (1.8%) was at least 2 times higher than the median infection rates for hispanics (0.9%) and whites (0.7%).

9220,0.003,3.0,"Enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) is the first self-injectable antiretroviral (ARV) therapy approved for the treatment of HIV. This study was undertaken to explore the perceptions of injectable ARVs among physicians and treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients and identify potential motivators or barriers to the initiation of injectable ARV therapies. This empirical study was conducted based on qualitative field research conducted in multiple centres in five European countries and the US. A purposive sampling strategy was employed and structured interviews carried out with physicians and patients. Discussion guides for these interviews focused on attitudinal responses to a range of key areas. For physicians, these areas included HIV treatment, treatment-experienced patients and their relationships with them and injectable therapy usage, while for patients - some of whom were receiving enfuvirtide therapy - the focus included relationships with their physicians and attitudes towards injectable ARV therapy. Sixty-eight physicians and 43 patients were interviewed. Qualitative analysis of the interview responses revealed a number of recurring themes among physician and patient perceptions of HIV and its treatment. Physicians tended to view injectable ARVs as a last resort, with only limited suitability among treatment-experienced patients and a low level of patient acceptability. In contrast, patients generally perceived the potential value of effective injectable ARV therapy, if recommended to them by their physicians, indicating that its benefits could outweigh the drawbacks associated with its administration. This study identified some potential disconnects between physician and patient perceptions of injectable therapy. Our findings emphasize the need for patients to discuss their treatment goals with their physicians so that they can work together to find the regimen that is most likely to achieve these goals."
3524,0.003,3.0,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified host genetic variation to be critical for predicting treatment response and spontaneous clearance in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). These important new studies are reviewed and their future clinical implications discussed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the region of the IL28B gene on chromosome 19, coding for the interferon (IFN)-λ-3 or IL28B gene, are strongly associated with treatment response to pegylated IFN and ribavirin in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. The good response variant is associated with a twofold increase in the rate of cure. Allele frequencies differ between ethnic groups, largely explaining the observed differences in response rates between Caucasians, African Americans and Asians. IL28B polymorphism is also strongly associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV. The biological mechanisms responsible for these genetic associations remain unknown and are the focus of ongoing research. Knowledge of a patient's IL28B genotype is likely to aid in clinical decision making with standard of care regimens. Future studies will investigate the possibility of individualizing treatment duration and novel regimens according to IL28B type."
1908,0.002,2.0,"The goal of the study was to improve the methodology of HIV genotyping for analysis of HIV drug resistance and HIV clustering. Using the protocol of Gall et al. (A. Gall, B. Ferns, C. Morris, S. Watson, M. Cotten, M. Robinson, N. Berry, D. Pillay, and P. Kellam, J Clin Microbiol 50:3838-3844, 2012, doi:10.1128/JCM.01516-12), we developed a robust methodology for amplification of two large fragments of viral genome covering about 80% of the unique HIV-1 genome sequence. Importantly, this method can be applied to both viral RNA and proviral DNA amplification templates, allowing genotyping in HIV-infected subjects with suppressed viral loads (e.g., subjects on antiretroviral therapy [ART]). The two amplicons cover critical regions across the HIV-1 genome (including pol and env), allowing analysis of mutations associated with resistance to protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTIs]), integrase strand transfer inhibitors, and virus entry inhibitors. The two amplicons generated span 7,124 bp, providing substantial sequence length and numbers of informative sites for comprehensive phylogenic analysis and greater refinement of viral linkage analyses in HIV prevention studies. The long-range HIV genotyping from proviral DNA was successful in about 90% of 212 targeted blood specimens collected in a cohort where the majority of patients had suppressed viral loads, including 65% of patients with undetectable levels of HIV-1 RNA loads. The generated amplicons could be sequenced by different methods, such as population Sanger sequencing, single-genome sequencing, or next-generation ultradeep sequencing. The developed method is cost-effective-the cost of the long-range HIV genotyping is under $140 per subject (by Sanger sequencing)-and has the potential to enable the scale up of public health HIV prevention interventions.

8685,0.002,2.0,Simian-human immunodeficiency virus encoding both reverse transcriptase (RT) and envelope genes of HIV-1 (RT Env SHIV) is important for evaluating biomedical prevention modalities for HIV/AIDS. We describe virological characterization of a clade B RT Env SHIV following infection of macaques via multiple routes. In vivo passage of the RT Env SHIV through Indian rhesus macaque enhanced infectivity. Expanded virus had minimal envelope heterogeneity and was inhibited by NNRTIs and CCR5 antagonists. Infection of macaques with RT Env SHIV via mucosal or intravenous routes resulted in stable infection accompanied by peak plasma viremia of approximately 5×10(6) copies/ml that was controlled beyond set point. Molecular homogeneity of the virus was maintained following in vivo passage. Inhibition of RT Env SHIV by RT and entry inhibitors and ease of in vivo transmission make it a useful model for testing the efficacy of combinations of entry and RT inhibitors in nonhuman primates.

In this study semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is compared with a new branched DNA signal amplification methodology. Samples from HCV-infected patients as well as from human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients were evaluated. Reverse transcriptase PCR correlated well with the branched DNA assay (r = 0.7036, P < 0.05). HCV RNA was found to occur at significantly higher titers (P < 0.05) in patients coinfected with the human immunodeficiency virus compared with titers in those infected with HCV alone. Immune status as defined by the CD4+ count was not associated with the observed difference in viral titer."
8540,0.002,2.0,"Crofelemer (Fulyzaq) is a botanical drug substance (oligomeric proanthocyanidin) extracted from the stem bark latex of the Croton lechleri tree. Crofelemer undergoes minimal systemic absorption following oral administration; it acts locally within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract by inhibiting the two principal chloride ion channels in the luminal membrane of enterocytes. Crofelemer is the first (and so far only) agent to be approved by the US FDA specifically for the symptomatic relief of non-infectious (i.e. secretory) diarrhoea in adult patients with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy (ART). This approval was based on findings from the ADVENT study, a large (n = 376 randomized patients), multicentre, phase III trial in which the recommended dosage of oral crofelemer (125 mg twice daily) significantly reduced secretory diarrhoea in HIV-positive individuals on ART compared with placebo, as assessed over a 4-week period. Crofelemer was generally well tolerated in ADVENT (which included a 5-month placebo-free extension phase) and a 48-week, open-label, phase III safety study; infections and GI disorders were the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in patients receiving the drug. Of note, the overall incidence of TEAEs was similar in the crofelemer and placebo groups during the 4-week placebo-controlled phase of ADVENT. Treatment with crofelemer had no appreciable effect on immune parameters, such as HIV viral load and CD4+ cell counts."
9975,0.002,2.0,"Since routine testing began, 677,463 members of the Reserve Components of the US Army have been tested for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Of these, 1063 were positive, for a crude prevalence of 1.57/1000 tested. Prevalence varied greatly among different groups as defined by sex, ethnicity, marital status, age, and geographic location. Multivariate analysis indicated that prevalence was higher among men, blacks, and unmarried men and peaked at ages 30-34. The crude incidence density was 0.20/1000 person-years, and multivariate analysis of incidence revealed patterns similar to those for prevalence. Comparison of prevalence and incidence data provides evidence that an increasing proportion of infection is occurring among women and in nonmetropolitan and small urban areas."
3804,0.002,2.0,"In summary, HIV is a retrovirus with devastating consequences for those infected. Primary modes of transmission are through sexual contact and parenteral exposure to infected blood and body fluids. Prevalence of the virus among trauma patients, risk of exposure, and infection of health care workers are variable and to a large extent not known. Existing HIV infection and AIDS have both direct and indirect effects on care and outcome of trauma patients. Caring for these patients presents many challenges. Manifestations and complications of each condition may mask, mimic, or compound the other. Optimal care and outcome depend on knowledge of both diseases, and the specific nuances of their management. As with all trauma patients, a team approach coordinated by an identified team leader is indicated. Finally, to protect both the patient and the care giver, policies that effectively reduce exposure must be formulated, promulgated, and practiced."

We also determined the risk factors for this coinfection. Demographic and behavioural data were obtained using a standard questionnaire. The prevalence of HIV-HCV coinfection was 78.4% (95% CI: 76.3-80.5). Intravenous drug use (OR = 7.2; 95% CI: 4.9-10.6), imprisonment (OR = 6.9; 95% CI: 4.6-10.4), tattooing in prison (OR = 2.61; 95% CI: 1.4-4.8), tattooing out of prison (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.3-3.1) and age (OR = 1.02 with increasing each year of life; 95% CI: 1.0-1.04) were significantly associated with HCV-HIV coinfection. Prevalence of HCV-HIV coinfection is high in Shiraz. Intravenous drug use and imprisonment are the main risk factors for this coinfection. Therefore, serious implementation of HIV and HCV testing, education, prevention, care and treatment programmes and evaluation of harm reduction programmes in prisons are very important."

Usually, the diagnosis of such viruses employs serological assays; however, some difficulties in confirming HTLV-2 infection have been reported in high-risk populations in Brazil. We present data of an unusual case of coinfection with HIV-1, HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HCV in a male IDU in which HTLV-2 was detected only by molecular assays. Comparative analysis of retroviruses from 2002 and 2012 showed identical HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 sequences (LTR, env, and tax), and a change in HIV-1 tropism from CXCR4 to CCR5. No mutation was detected in the hot points of the env region of the HTLV-2 isolate that justified the lack of rgp46-II-specific antibodies. These data emphasize the need for molecular assays to diagnose HTLV-2 in high-risk populations in Brazil."

2703,0.002,2.0,"Dual HIV infection has been found in regions with high HIV prevalence and in populations infected with diverse strains of HIV. The prevalence of dual infection in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), where there is a high prevalence of HIV and an influx of immigrants who may be infected with different HIV subtypes, is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of dual infection in KZN. Eighty-three samples were obtained from chronically infected patients on ARV treatment from sites throughout KZN. Subtyping of the samples was performed using the heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA). Twelve samples that had possible dual infection by HMA were cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that there was no dual infection in these samples. Contrary to a previous study, we did not find dual infection in this region. The patients in our study may be different from those in the previous study in terms of transmission risk factors, treatment, and stage of infection (acute vs. chronic). This study may have important implications for vaccine development and for the pathogenesis and treatment of dual HIV infection."
5144,0.002,2.0,"This study examined the relationship between the severity of acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) illness and disease progression and death. The population included 218 patients with acute HIV-1 illness and 41 asymptomatic patients who underwent HIV-1 seroconversion; the patients were followed up prospectively. We analyzed progression to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clinical categories B and C (AIDS-defining conditions) and death according to an additive clinical score (CS) based on six predictive clinical features at the time of acute HIV-1 infection. Compared with patients with a CS of 0 (asymptomatic patients), those with a CS of 3-4 and 5-6 had faster progression to category B disease (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.92; and HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.34-2.40; respectively); those with a CS of 5-6 had faster progression to category C disease (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01-1.89) and death (HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.27-3.32). Thus, the number of symptoms and signs at the time of acute HIV-1 illness affects disease progression and survival, even in symptomatic patients who have undergone seroconversion."
4533,0.002,2.0,"The demographic, social and clinical presentation of 100 HIV positive patients hospitalized in Tikur Anbessa Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, between 1986 and 1989 are described. The mean age is 38.2 years with a range of 16 to 58. Over 75% of the patients are under 40 years. They came from ten different regions of Ethiopia. Only 82% of the patients fulfil the provisional World Health Organization clinical case definition of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Tuberculosis is the commonest infection, presenting in unusual and aggressive ways. However, response to chemotherapy is similar to that in HIV-negative patients. It is recommended that all patients with unusual and aggressive tuberculosis should be screened for HIV and Mantoux-positive HIV carriers should receive INH prophylaxis. Also, all non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases should be tested for HIV. Kaposi's sarcoma was not seen (see Addendum). As HIV infection is spreading rapidly and diagnostic facilities are limited, physicians and other health workers must develop a high index of suspicion to test for HIV among high risk groups, such as prostitutes, individuals having contacts with prostitutes, single, divorced and unemployed women living in towns and truck drivers, when they present with significant weight loss, unexplained and prolonged fever and diarrhoea, lymphadenopathy and oral thrush. Also, facilities and expertise for diagnosing opportunistic infections should be available in hospitals to prolong the lives of patients with AIDS."
7323,0.002,2.0,"Over a period of 3 months a human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-infected patient showed a sequence of positive-negative-positive anti-HIV screening test results. During this period the level of HIV p24 antigen declined and the HIV antibody pattern by Western blot gradually became complete, suggesting recent HIV infection. However the patient's weight loss, esophageal candidiasis, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, together with the severely and persistently lowered CD4 cell counts and the absence of an IgM anti-HIV response, suggest late-stage HIV infection. Despite additional and follow-up testing, it was impossible to determine whether the patient suffered from acute, primary HIV infection with severe immunodepression or from advanced HIV infection (AIDS) with hampered HIV antibody production leading to false-negative test results by the anti-HIV enzyme immunoassay and Western blot. This case illustrates that HIV serology does not always follow the rules. The presence of HIV infection should be considered in a patient showing clinical signs of acute or late-stage HIV infection, even if the anti-HIV assay is negative."
9192,0.002,2.0,"Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is a distinct variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma initially described in HIV-positive patients. Several studies have reported the occurrence of PBL in HIV-negative patients, but comparative data are lacking. The goal of this study was to compare the characteristics of HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with PBL. A MEDLINE search was undertaken through August 2009 for cases of PBL in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. Cases were identified and clinicopathological data were gathered. χ(2) was used to compare categorical and t-test to compare continuous variables between groups. Calculated Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were compared using the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazard regression was used for multivariate analysis. From 228 identified cases of PBL, 157 were HIV-positive and 71 HIV-negative. HIV-positive patients were younger, and more likely to be men, present with oral involvement, respond to chemotherapy, and express CD20, CD56, and EBV-encoded RNA than HIV-negative patients. In univariate analysis, age ≥60, advanced stage, bone marrow involvement, no chemotherapy, Ki-67 expression >80%, and HIV-negative status were associated with worse overall survival. In multivariate analysis, advanced stage and no chemotherapy were independent adverse prognostic factors. In conclusion, HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with PBL have different clinicopathological characteristics, including a better response to chemotherapy and longer survival in HIV-positive patients."

This study compares the level of satisfaction of physicians reporting their experience with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) testing with the satisfaction levels of those physicians reporting their experience with hepatitis B virus (HBV) testing. By mail, 6,570 licensed San Diego County physicians were surveyed. Among those who tested for HIV-1 or HBV, their satisfaction with four different HIV-1 or HBV testing parameters was assessed: 1) specimen submission process, 2) test accuracy, 3) clarity of test report, and 4) turnaround time. Overall, physician satisfaction with both HIV-1 and HBV testing was high, particularly for test accuracy (means of 2.79 and 2.84, respectively on a 3-point scale), although slightly lower for turnaround time (means of 2.40 and 2.43, respectively). Mean satisfaction with the specimen submission process and test accuracy were higher for physicians who ordered HBV tests than for those who ordered HIV-1 tests. Satisfaction with the four HIV-1 testing process parameters varied significantly by physician specialty, practice type, and type of laboratory used. For HBV testing, significant differences were observed only for turnaround time. For both HIV-1 and HBV testing, those who received a final interpretation of laboratory results were more satisfied with test report clarity than those who did not. Although physician satisfaction with HIV-1 and HBV testing is high, this study identifies the least satisfied groups and specific areas in the testing process than may need improvement."

Assessments included patient-reported Medication Adherence Self-Report Inventory, SF-12v2 Quality of Life assessment, HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, and HIV Symptom Index Questionnaire through Week 48. Additional evaluations included study drug discontinuations due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). A total of 786 participants (n=394 RPV/FTC/TDF, n=392 EFV/FTC/TDF) were included. Fewer RPV/FTC/TDF-treated than EFV/FTC/TDF-treated participants discontinued study drug due to TEAEs (2.5% vs. 8.7%), with 41% (14/34) TEAE-related discontinuations in the EFV/FTC/TDF group occurring within the first four weeks of treatment. Treatment adherence and satisfaction remained high through Week 48 and quality of life improved from baseline in both groups. There were no significant between-group differences in virologic success (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) regardless of adherence (<95% or ≥95%). Significant between-group differences favouring RPV/FTC/TDF were observed for the HIV SIQ symptoms of difficulty falling or staying asleep (p = .022) and diarrhea or loose bowel movements (p = .002). In conclusion, 48-week treatment with RPV/FTC/TDF or EFV/FTC/TDF was associated with high adherence, high treatment satisfaction, and improved quality of life. TEAE-related discontinuations and patient-reported symptoms indicate that RPV/FTC/TDF may be somewhat better tolerated than EFV/FTC/TDF. "
9895,0.002,2.0,"Previous studies have suggested that hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants may account for the presence of HBV DNA in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative patients (occult HBV infection). However, it is not known how widespread these variants are and how they influence the course of liver disease. To determine the prevalence of variants within the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBsAg, we investigated 2,565 subjects, including subjects with chronic hepatitis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hemodialysis patients, and blood donors. Fifty-one of them had occult HBV infection. The entire S gene from 46 of these patients was sequenced from amplified serum HBV DNA. Forty-three percent (20 of 46) had mutations in the MHR of HBsAg. Thirty-two amino acid substitutions between positions 100-160 of the MHR of HBsAg were detected in 18 patients, and these ranged from 1 to 4 per patient. These changes involved 11 positions inside and 5 outside of the historical first and second loops of the ""a"" determinant, and included the following: Q101K, T115A, K122N, T123A, T126N, Q129N, G130R, T131I, M133T, F134L, C138Y, K141E, P142S, G145R, N146S, and C147F/R. Combinations of mutations were detected in 9 patients, and 7 of these have not been described before. Two further patients had insertion mutations immediately before the ""a"" determinant. Monoclonal antibody binding tests with the Royal Free hepatitis B surface (RFHBs) panel of antibodies revealed decreased immunoreactivity in 6 novel variants of HBsAg. The existence of patients with occult HBV infection caused by HBsAg variants, therefore, has implications for their possible transmission through sexual contact and by blood transfusion."

8334,0.002,2.0,"Medication adherence is a complex behaviour with multiple determinants. Understanding the barriers and facilitators of adherence is invaluable for programme improvement, which assists the foundation of adherence intervention strategies. A qualitative study was conducted in six selected hospitals of Addis Ababa in 2008, to explore barriers and facilitators to antiretroviral medication adherence among HIV-infected paediatric patients. Twelve caregivers of adherent and non-adherent children and 14 key informants in five hospitals were included in the study. The findings revealed that over-dosage (heavy pill burden), fear of stigma and discrimination, cost and access to transportation, lack of understanding of the benefit of taking the medication, economic problems in the household, and lack of nutritional support were the barriers to adherence to HAART. The presence of mobile/wall alarm, the presence of follow-up counselling, improved health of the child, ART clinic setups, and disclosure of HIV serostatus were among the facilitators. This study indicated that paediatric adherence to antiretroviral therapy faces a huge challenge.

We aimed to monitor the HBV status of breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy with preemptive lamivudine over time. Six breast cancer patients carrying hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were monitored during chemotherapy, five in the adjuvant setting and one with metastatic disease. Preemptive lamivudine was given throughout the chemotherapy course. HBsAg, HBV envelope antigen (HBeAg), anti-HBV envelope antibody (HBe Ab), serial serum alanine transaminase (ALT), quantitative HBV viral DNA analysis, and HBV DNA precore promoter and precore sequence were monitored. One patient carried wild type and the other five precore mutant strain of HBV by examination of HBV sequence in precore promoter and precore region. No evident HBV reactivation developed, and all patients tolerated lamivudine well. During the 6-to-8-month follow-up after cessation of cytotoxic therapy and withdrawal of lamivudine, serum ALT remained unchanged, although an increase of HBV DNA levels in four patients was found. No emergence of the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) lamivudine-selective resistant strain was observed in the six patients. Preemptive use of lamivudine can effectively prevent reactivation of HBV in breast cancer patients receiving postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Lamivudine can be discontinued safely without emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV strain or rebound HBV flare-up.

4356,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis C virus genotype 4 (HCV-G4) is prevalent in the Middle East and Africa and has spread to several regions in Europe. HCV-G4 represents a major health problem in Egypt, with a prevalence rate of 13%. Recently, HCV-G4 has been spreading in Europe particularly among intravenous drug users (IDU) populations, who represent the main reservoir for HCV in Europe. This article reviews the current therapeutic strategies for HCV-G4 infections in different populations. HCV-G4 has been considered a difficult-to-treat genotype because of the poor sustained virological response (SVR) rates reported with a conventional interferon (IFN)-based regimen. Pegylated IFN and ribavirin combination therapy was associated with significant improvements in SVR rates that currently exceed 60%, particularly with individualized therapy. Lower response rates have been reported in specific situations, namely chronic HCV-G4 infection in IDUs and patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Rapid and early virological responses have been useful tools for determination of the duration of therapy."

Therefore, we evaluated the associations between the use of different antiretroviral drug classes and HAART combinations, and liver fibrosis in HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C. Six hundred and eighty-three HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, who underwent a liver biopsy and who had not received anti-HCV treatment were included. Age at HCV infection < 23years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.7, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.3-0.9, P = 0.05) and protease inhibitor (PI)-based HAART versus no use of HAART (AOR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3-0.9, P = 0.01) were negatively associated with advanced fibrosis (> or = F3). PI-based HAART versus no use of HAART (AOR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.7, P = 0.001) was negatively associated with fibrosis progression rate > or = 0.2 units/year and independently of age at HCV infection and CD4+ T-cell counts. Fifteen (17%) patients treated only with PIs and zidovudine plus lamivudine showed > or = F3, compared with 65 (37%) patients without HAART (P = 0.001). Forty (31%) patients on PI and stavudine plus lamivudine showed > or = F3 (P = 0.3, when compared with patients with no HAART). The use of PI-based HAART in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients is associated with less severe fibrosis and slower progression of fibrosis. The nucleoside analogue backbone in a HAART regimen may influence this association."
7664,0.002,2.0,"In hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections, detection of only anti-HBc in the absence of HBsAg and anti-HBs is known as 'anti-HBc only' situation. In this study we investigated the rate of HBV-DNA positivity in anti-HBc only-positive 45 patients (29 male, 16 female; mean age: 39.2 +/- 12.3 years) who were followed in the outpatient clinics of a University Hospital in Düzce (located at northern west part of Turkey). HBV markers were investigated by 3rd generation ELISA (MEIA Axsym-Abbott), and HBV-DNA were searched by real-time PCR [extraction: Minielute (Qiagen, Germany); PCR kits: Florion HBV (lontek, Turkey); detection: i-cycler IQ5 (BioRad, USA)] methods. As a result, 24.4% (11/45) of the patients were found HBV-DNA positive (> 10(3) copies/ml). There was no statistically significant difference of HBV-DNA positivity rates between males (9/29; 31%) and females (2/16; 12.5%), (p= 0.15). It was concluded that there may be a serious risk of HBV transmission from anti-HBc only-positive patients since the rate of HBV-DNA positivity was found high in our study. Thus HBV-DNA screening should be performed in 'anti-HBc only' patient groups."
615,0.002,2.0,"Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a key molecule of the innate immune system and a competent to bind carbohydrates of a variety of microorganisms, resulting in complement activation and opsonophagocytosis against various pathogens. However, there is no systemic investigation on the MBL's role in innate immune responses against HIV-1 infection among northern Han Chinese. This study investigated the association between MBL and HIV-1 infection susceptibility among northern Han Chinese. A total of 91 HIV-1 infected patients and 91 HIV-1 seronegative healthy individuals were recruited. Six polymorphisms of MBL2 gene were genotyped by pyrosequencing. The quantitative measurement of serum MBL concentration and MBL complex activity were performed by ELISA. The CD4+ T-cell counts were determined by flow cytometry. The plasma viral loads of 91 HIV-1 infected patients were determined by bDNA method. The results show that there is an association between MBL and HIV-1 infection susceptibility among northern Han Chinese. The individuals with B variant, low serum MBL concentration and low MBL complex activity are more susceptible to HIV-1 infection."

Considering that HBV infection is linked to hepatocellular carcinoma and H pylori to gastric cancer, we investigated the incidence in this kind of patients in the northern Jiangsu Province, China. Rational management of these patients was also discussed."

3364,0.002,2.0,"Neurodegeneration and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-associated dementia (HAD) are the major disease manifestations of HIV-1 colonization of the central nervous system (CNS). In the brain, HIV-1 replicates in microglial cells and infiltrating macrophages and it persists in a low-productive, noncytolytic state in astrocytes. Astrocytes play critical roles in the maintenance of the brain microenvironment, responses to injury, and in neuronal signal transmission, and disruption of these functions by HIV-1 could contribute to HAD. To better understand the potential effects of HIV-1 on astrocyte biology, the authors investigated changes in gene expression using an efficient and sensitive rapid subtraction hybridization approach, RaSH. Primary human astrocytes were isolated from abortus brain tissue, low-passage cells were infected with HIV-1 or mock infected, and total cellular RNAs were isolated at multiple time points over a period of 1 week. This approach is designed to identify gene products modulated early and late after HIV-1 infection and limits the cloning of genes displaying normal cell-cycle fluctuations in astrocytes. By subtracting temporal cDNAs derived from HIV-1-infected astrocytes from temporal cDNAs made from uninfected cells, 10 genes displaying reduced expression in infected cells, termed astrocyte suppressed genes (ASGs), were identified and their suppression was confirmed by Northern blot hybridization. Both known and novel ASGs, not reported in current DNA databases, that are down-regulated by HIV-1 infection are described. Northern blotting confirms suppression of the same panel of ASGs by treatment of astrocytes with recombinant HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp120. These results extend our previous analysis of astrocyte genes induced or enhanced by HIV-1 infection and together they suggest that HIV-1 and viral proteins have profound effects on astrocyte physiology, which may influence their function in the CNS."
2087,0.002,2.0,"Human interleukin-6 has been shown to promote hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, it is not clear whether this influence is the result of a direct interaction between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the HBV envelope proteins or of a rather indirect mechanism. A direct interaction of IL-6 and the preS region of the large envelope protein (L-protein) of HBV has been reported. In this study we assessed the binding of IL-6 and of the IL-6 receptor subunits to the preS region of the L-protein of HBV. Binding of IL-6 and IL-6 receptor subunits sIL-6R and gp130 to preS was assessed by immunoprecipitation with recombinant preS proteins. In patient sera IL-6 and sIL-6R concentrations were analysed with respect to the course of hepatitis B infection during and after interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy. The IL-6 and IL-6 receptor subunits could not be precipitated with recombinant preS proteins. In sera of patients who responded to IFN-alpha therapy by virus elimination, a significant increase in sIL-6R concentration was measured. No increase in sIL-6R levels was seen in patients who did not respond to IFN-alpha. Hence, IL-6 and IL-6 receptor subunits do not bind to preS directly. A possible role for sIL-6R in the elimination of HBV infection is discussed."
7608,0.002,2.0,"The fourth conserved region (C4) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) surface glycoprotein has been shown to participate in CD4 binding and to influence viral tropism (A. Cordonnier, L. Montagnier, and M. Emerman, Nature [London] 340:571-574, 1989). To define the role of the corresponding region of HIV-2, we introduce single amino acid changes into the C4 sequence of HIV-2ROD. The effects of these mutations on glycoprotein function and on virus infectivity have been examined. We have shown that the tryptophan residue at position 428 is necessary primarily for CD4 binding. The isoleucine residue at position 421 is necessary for the establishment of productive infection in the promonocytic cell line U937, while it is dispensable to some extent for infection of primary T lymphocytes or the lymphocytic cell line SUP-T1. This replication defect correlated with the failure of the Ile-421-to-Thr (Ile-421-->Thr) mutant glycoprotein to form syncytia in U937 cells. DNA analysis of revertant viruses revealed that a strong selective pressure was exerted on residue 421 of the surface glycoprotein to allow HIV-2 infection of U937 cells. These results demonstrate that this region of HIV-2 plays an important role in determining fusion efficiency in a cell-dependent manner and consequently can influence viral tropism."
305,0.002,2.0,"Besides mediating the viral entry process, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope protein gp41 can bind to many host cell components and regulate cell functions. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we screened a human bone marrow cDNA library and identified a novel gp41-binding protein, CD74 (the MHC class II-associated invariant chain). Here, we report possible biological effects mediated by interaction between gp41 and CD74. We found that HIV-1 gp41 could bind directly to host CD74 in HIV-1-infected cells, and the peptide 6358 derived from gp41 loop region (aa 597-611) could effectively block the gp41-CD74 interaction. As a result of this binding, recombinant soluble gp41 and gp41 peptide 6358 activated the CD74-mediated ERK/MAPK pathway and significantly enhanced HIV-1 infection in vitro. Conversely, the enhancing effect could be suppressed by the recombinant CD74 extracellular domain. These results reveal a novel mechanism underlying gp41 mediation of HIV-1 infection and replication."
3311,0.002,2.0,"From viral binding to the hepatocyte surface to extracellular virion release, the replication cycle of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) intersects at various levels with lipid metabolism; this leads to a derangement of the lipid profile and to increased viral infectivity. Accumulating evidence supports the crucial regulatory role of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in lipoprotein metabolism. Notably, a complex interaction between HCV and PCSK9 has been documented. Indeed, either increased or reduced circulating PCSK9 levels have been observed in HCV patients; this discrepancy might be related to several confounders, including HCV genotype, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection and the ambiguous HCV-mediated influence on PCSK9 transcription factors. On the other hand, PCSK9 may itself influence HCV infectivity, inasmuch as the expression of different hepatocyte surface entry proteins and receptors is regulated by PCSK9. The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence about the complex interaction between HCV and liver lipoprotein metabolism, with a specific focus on PCSK9. The underlying assumption of this review is that the interconnections between HCV and PCSK9 may be central to explain viral infectivity."
6989,0.002,2.0,"Isolated antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) is frequent in HIV-infected patients, and it may be a marker of occult hepatitis B.

3201,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) has recently been recognized as a paradoxical (surrogate) marker for non-A, non-B hepatitis agents in donated blood. We studied prospectively the hepatitis B virus antigen and antibody status and liver functions in 63 uremic patients admitted consecutively to our dialysis program. Nineteen percent of uremic patients, negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B virus surface antibody (anti-HBs), hepatitis B virus DNA, and antibody to delta agents, had anti-HBc in their sera at the time of admission to maintenance dialysis. This prevalence was significantly higher than that of the medical personnel working in the dialysis unit (P = 0.043) and healthy controls (P = 0.027). The prevalence of persistent presence of isolated anti-HBc increased to 31% in these uremic patients on long-term maintenance dialysis. Four patients had developed anti-HBc alone during their course of maintenance dialysis, and the appearance of anti-HBc was preceded by blood transfusion within 4 to 8 weeks. Transient or recurrent hepatic dysfunction occurred in three of these four patients. Patients with isolated anti-HBc were characterized by a higher incidence of repeated liver dysfunction (P less than 0.005), elevated alanine transaminase levels (P less than 0.005), and a higher transfusion requirement (P less than 0.01). Our data strongly suggest that these patients with isolated anti-HBc may have acquired either hepatitis B virus infection or non-A, non-B hepatitis through repeated blood transfusions despite careful screening of the donated blood to exclude transmission of hepatitis B virus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8830,0.002,2.0,"In East Africa, bacteremia is more common in hospitalized human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-positive than -negative patients. In 1991, blood cultures and clinical and laboratory data were obtained from 319 patients in Ivory Coast, where both HIV-1 and -2 infections occur. Forty-three bacterial, 10 mycobacterial, and 8 fungal pathogens were isolated from blood of 54 patients (17%). Pathogens isolated significantly (P < or = .05) more frequently from HIV-positive than -negative patients were nonmycobacterial bacteria, particularly Salmonella enteritidis; mycobacteria, particularly Mycobacterium tuberculosis-Mycobacterium bovis; and yeast or fungus. HIV-1 or -2 positivity was associated with a 3-fold increased risk for septicemia (P < .02). HIV-positive patients with fever or with lymphocyte counts < 1000 were more likely to be septicemic than those without these characteristics. Mortality increased significantly with HIV positivity (40% vs. 14%, P < .001) and, among HIV-positive patients, with having pathogens isolated from blood (63% vs. 33%, P < .001)."
4364,0.002,2.0,"Virologic failure on continuous antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with variable changes in CD4 T-cell counts: peripheral CD4 T-cell counts decrease in conjunction with a resurgence of plasma virus (nonresponders) or remain stable or continue to increase despite ongoing virus replication (discordant responders). This study found that HIV-1 isolated from nonresponders had significantly greater replicative capacity in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as an enhanced ability to induce apoptosis in both HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected CD4 T cells compared with virus isolated from discordant responders. Enhanced replicative capacity in PBMCs of virus isolated from nonresponders was inhibited by AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist. Virus quasispecies isolated from PBMCs from nonresponders used both CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CX chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) for entry, in contrast to virus isolated from PBMCs from discordant responders, which predominantly used CCR5. In contrast, virus isolated from plasma from both groups predominantly used CCR5. In summary, although drug resistance may lead to impaired viral fitness, the capacity of virus quasispecies from PBMCs to use CXCR4 may have significant consequences on viral replicative capacity and potentially on clinical outcome."
2323,0.002,2.0,"A defect in specific T cell immunity has long been assumed to be the central mechanism of persistent Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Recent studies on HBV transgenic mice have suggested, however, that functional deficit of dendritic cells (DC) was an underlying cause for the T cell dysfunction. The functions of monocyte-derived DC were determined by studying 75 subjects that included chronic hepatitis B patients with low or high HBV load; antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) positive individuals who had recovered completely from previous acute HBV infection; healthy donors who had received hepatitis B vaccination and were anti-HBs positive; and immunologically naïve to HBV or the vaccine individual. Impaired interactions between monocyte-derived DC and T cells were shown in chronic HBV infection patients, especially in those with active virus replication. The dysfunctions included: (i) failure of DC to increase human leukocyte antigen (HLA-II), B7 expression and interleukin-12 secretion in responses to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), (ii) defective induction of T cell proliferative response to HBsAg, (iii) failure to activate T cells to produce cytokines and (iv) deficit in the induction of antigen specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In vitro treatment of DC with tumour necrosis factor-alpha improved HLA-II and B7 expression, as well as Th cell and CTL responses. It is concluded that defective DC-T cell interactions may account for the specific T cell immune defects in chronic HBV infection. Immunotherapy that aims at restoring DC functions could offer a new opportunity for effectively managing persistent HBV infections."
2643,0.002,2.0,"In humans infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), clinical disease due to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is one of the AIDS-defining diseases; HCMV is the most common opportunistic infection found postmortem. Histologically, the typical lesions are characterized by ""owl's eye cells."" In rhesus monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), comparable lesions are caused by an infection with the rhesus CMV (RhCMV). The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of productive and latent RhCMV infection in monkeys infected with SIV macaques (SIVmac). Eleven SIVmac-infected rhesus monkeys, which were euthanatized after developing AIDS-like disease, and 11 clinically healthy and uninfected animals comprised the study. The monkeys were screened serologically for RhCMV by western-blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed by an indirect immunoperoxidase technique with a polyclonal rabbit RhCMV-antiserum. Lesions characteristic of RhCMV-associated diseases were detected histologically. All animals were latently RhCMV-infected. Seven of eleven (63.6%) SIV-infected macaques were productively RhCMV infected according to immunohistochemistry. RhCMV antigen was identified in the gastrointestinal tract, the hepatobiliary system, the lungs, and the testicles. Two of these seven animals showed characteristic inflammatory lesions associated with productive infection. Consequently, the CMV prevalence in SIVmac-infected rhesus monkeys and human AIDS patients is comparable."
916,0.002,2.0,"Multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) were detected in cell lines established from peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with: (a) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and lymphadenopathy syndrome (LAS), (b) chronic active hepatitis (CAH), (c) papular acrodermatitis (PA) negative for hepatitis B virus antigens but positive for EBV, and (d) epidermolysis bullosa acquisita positive for EBV. All the cell lines established, including those established from AIDS and LAS patients, were examined for the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies directed against the HIV antigens p17 and p24 and for the presence of reverse transcriptase. All the cell lines were found to be negative for HIV. While the cell lines obtained from AIDS patients still express MGCs after more than two years in culture, their supernatants are negative for reverse transcriptase activity and carry phenotypic markers characteristic of B cells. From the LAS and chronic active hepatitis patients we obtained a monolayer of adherent cells almost completely represented by MGCs that lasted for six and four months, respectively. After this period of time a proliferation process took place. Both the cell lines obtained carry B cell phenotypic markers, but MGCs are still a characteristic only for the LAS-derived cell culture. Non infected patients or normal subjects express MGCs only during the early stage of the cultue. The correlation between the presence of MGCs and a retrovirus infection is discussed in the light of the role of MGCs in the pathogenesis of AIDS."
1809,0.002,2.0,"Human T-cell lymphotropic viruses type 1 and 2 are retroviruses that share the same routes of transmission as HIV-1. Since these agents are prevalent simultaneously in different parts of the world, coinfection is a frequently reported event. However, prevalence rates of coinfection differ for distinct populations and regions of the world or for each virus, with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 being more prevalent among HIV-1-infected individuals in the Southern hemisphere, while type 2 is more frequently found in the Northern hemisphere. In common, they share the tropism for T-lymphocytes, although human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 and HIV-1 are predominantly CD4+ T-cell tropic and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 2 preferentially infects CD8+ cells. The biological properties of HIV-1 are distinct of those found in human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1/2. This fact makes possible an in vivo interaction between these agents, when coinfecting the same patients, with potentially relevant clinical implications. The available evidence suggests a protective role for coinfection by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 2 on AIDS progression. This hypothesis is supported by several laboratory evidences, as well as by a number of clinical studies that found no significant interaction between human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 2 and HIV-1, or even detected a protective effect on HIV-1 disease. On the other hand, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 seems to be a significant cofactor, with a potentially important role in HIV-1 infection. Although the clinical evidence is still controversial with regard to the real impact that coinfection exerts on clinical evolution, the majority of studies suggest it is associated with a modification of the natural history of HIV-1 infection, with a faster clinical progression and a shorter survival time. The main limitation of the available data is due to methodological problems in the majority of studies, which weaken the validity of their conclusions. A common finding in coinfection by both human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 and 2 is the increase in CD4+ cell count, but without any additional immune benefit for patients. Due to the limited available data, we need more, larger studies, designed to respond to the pending questions on the real significance of coinfection by these retroviruses."
7597,0.002,2.0,"The polymerase chain amplification reaction (PCR) is a sensitive, specific, and quantitative assay of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The assay was performed with polymerases from Escherichia coli or Thermus aquaticus (Taq). A single pair of oligonucleotide primers within the long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences were used to detect HIV-1 sequences in infected cell cultures and fresh tissues of the large majority of infected individuals. The amplified product was a faithful copy of this LTR sequence. Utilization of a subsaturating number of cycles of amplification allowed quantitation of HIV-1 DNA sequences."
2221,0.002,2.0,"Sequences from the nef/LTR overlap region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) genome were amplified from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 40 HIV-2-infected individuals in The Gambia, West Africa. Additional sequences from the plasma of three blood donors were also derived. Analysis of HIV-2 U3 LTR transcription factor elements (PuB-1, p-ets, PuB-2, peri-kappa B, and NF-kappa B sites) indicated a relatively high level of conservation in vivo. The region immediately 3' of the nef termination codon, which exhibits clade-dependent specificity, was targeted by PCR to differentiate HIV-2 subtype A from subtype B infections, the two principal clinical HIV-2 subtypes. All clinical samples analyzed (n = 43) from The Gambia were identified as HIV-2 subtype A by a combination of LTR sequence analysis and subtype-specific amplification of subtypes A and B. Differential PCR amplification of the HIV-2 U3 LTR region represents a rapid means of differentiating subtype A from subtype B infections, the two dominant HIV-2 subtypes that are important in human disease."
8686,0.002,2.0,"Isolates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) derived from the central nervous system (CNS) display properties distinctive from blood-derived isolates, including a high incidence of macrophage tropism in CNS isolates. Macrophage tropism is a result, in part, of DNA sequence variation in the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gene, but evidence also exists suggesting differences in the long terminal repeat (LTR) may contribute to differential gene expression. To investigate the nature of HIV-1 LTR sequence variation in the brain, we have sequenced bases -374 to +43 of the LTR from the brains of four HIV-1-infected patients. A total of 56 clones were derived from either both gray and white matter (three brains) or white matter alone (one brain), and these sequences were compared to 17 published sequences derived from multiple sources. A total of five LTR quasispecies were found. Overall, there was a significant amount of sequence variation both within and between brains, comparable to that seen in quasispecies of the envelope glycoprotein derived from blood or brain. The vast majority of the variation was seen in regions upstream from the two NF-kappa B sites. Compared to the blood-derived, T cell-tropic IIIB LTR, a majority of clones from two or more of the brains shared 11 unique substitutions in transcription factor binding sites, of which eight were shared with the CNS-derived clones JR-CSF and JR-FL and altered the NF-AT and LEF-1 transcription factor binding sites. These findings correlate with published functional studies showing CNS-derived HIV-1 LTRs are distinct from the blood-derived IIIB LTR, and represent a starting point for future studies designed to determine which LTR sequence variations are associated with cell-specific differences in gene expression in the CNS."
8013,0.002,2.0,"We previously showed that superoxide (O2-) significantly enhanced human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-induced syncytia formation in co-cultured infected and uninfected human T cells. In this study, we describe a novel chemotactic response of uninfected CD4+ T cells by stimulating infected T cells with O2-. Syncytia formation was amplified only when persistently infected cells were stimulated by O2-. When the infected cells in lower well of microplate were cultured with uninfected cells in the upper well of a Boyden chamber with 8.0 microns pores, uninfected cell migration to the porous membrane was significantly amplified by stimulating infected cells with O2-. In contrast, similar functions were slight under the same assay conditions in the presence of known chemokines such as human RANTES and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP-1 alpha and beta), which all activate T lymphocytes. In addition, it is unlikely that the O2(-)-induced chemotactic response is due to soluble HIV-1 proteins from infected cells or to amplified expression levels of cell surface functional molecules such as CD4 and LFA-1 (CD11a and CD18) as well as HIV-1 Env gp120 on uninfected and/or infected cells. Thus, an unknown chemotactic factor could be generated from infected T cells by stimulation with O2- and it might contribute to viral transmission by activating cell-to-cell interactions."
5189,0.002,2.0,"Despite the fact that the survival of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has improved worldwide because of the increasingly powerful and highly active antiretroviral therapy, opportunistic infections (OIs) of the central nervous system (CNS) remain a serious burden. HIV-1 is capable of entering the CNS through infected peripheral monocytes, but its effect on OIs of CNS remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of HIV-1 in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with CNS OIs. A total of 24 patients with CNS OIs and 16 non-CNS OIs (control) cases were selected. These AIDS patients were infected with HIV-1 by paid blood donors in China. HIV-1 loads in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were detected using RT-PCR, and the C2-V5 region of HIV-1 envelope gene was amplified from viral quasispecies isolated from CSF using nested PCR. The CSF HIV-1 load of CNS OIs was higher than that of non-CNS OIs, but plasma HIV-1 load of CNS OIs was not higher than that of non-CNS OIs. The nucleotide sequence of C2-V5 region of the HIV-1 quasispecies isolated from the CSF of CNS OIs had a high diversity, and the HIV-1 quasispecies isolated from the CSF of CNS OIs revealed R5 tropism as 11/25 charge rule. These results suggest that high levels of divergent HIV-1 quasispecies in the CNS probably contribute to opportunistic infections. "
871,0.002,2.0,"A retrospective study was conducted to determine the mortality, causes and risk factors for death among HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Korea. The outcomes were determined by time periods, during the first year of ART and during 1-5 yr after ART initiation, respectively. Patients lost to follow-up were traced to ascertain survival status. Among 327 patients initiating ART during 1998-2006, 68 patients (20.8%) died during 5-yr follow-up periods. Mortality rate per 100 person-years was 8.69 (95% confidence interval, 5.68-12.73) during the first year of ART, which was higher than 4.13 (95% confidence interval, 2.98-5.59) during 1-5 yr after ART. Tuberculosis was the most common cause of death in both periods (30.8% within the first year of ART and 16.7% during 1-5 yr after ART). During the first year of ART, clinical category B and C at ART initiation, and underlying malignancy were significant risk factors for mortality. Between 1 and 5 yr after ART initiation, CD4 cell count ≤ 50 cells/µL at ART initiation, hepatitis B virus co-infection, and visit constancy ≤ 50% were significant risk factors for death. This suggests that different strategies to reduce mortality according to the time period after ART initiation are needed. "
7731,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes acute and chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Due to its error-prone replication via reverse transcription, HBV can rapidly evolve variants that escape vaccination and/or become resistant to CHB treatment with nucleoside/nucleotide analogs (NAs). This is particularly problematic for the first generation NAs lamivudine and adefovir. Though now superseded by more potent NAs, both are still widely used. Furthermore, resistance against the older NAs can contribute to cross-resistance against more advanced NAs. For lack of feasible HBV infection systems, the biology of such variants is not well understood. From the recent discovery of Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) as an HBV receptor new in vitro infection systems are emerging, yet access to the required large amounts of virions, in particular variants, remains a limiting factor. Stably HBV producing cell lines address both issues by allowing to study intracellular viral replication and as a permanent source of defined virions. Accordingly, we generated a panel of new tetracycline regulated TetOFF HepG2 hepatoma cell lines which produce six lamivudine and adefovir resistance-associated and two vaccine escape variants of HBV as well as the model virus woolly monkey HBV (WMHBV). The cell line-borne viruses reproduced the expected NA resistance profiles and all were equally sensitive against a non-NA drug. The new cell lines should be valuable to investigate under standardized conditions HBV resistance and cross-resistance. With titers of secreted virions reaching >3 x 10(7) viral genome equivalents per ml they should also facilitate exploitation of the new in vitro infection systems."

6883,0.002,2.0,"The Transfusion Safety Study (TSS) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) established a repository of approximately 200,000 sera from blood donors in late 1984 and early 1985. Collections were made in the four metropolitan areas with the highest prevalence of AIDS. Retrospective testing showed an overall anti-HIV-1 prevalence of 16 cases per 10,000 donations. In this study, the predictive value of a negative initial enzyme-linked immunoassay was estimated from both quality control specimens and the rescreening of 13,461 sera to be greater than 99.99 percent with respect to technical error. Among anti-HIV-1-positive persons, there was a 1.3- to 1.5-fold excess of first-time donors. The anti-HIV-1 prevalence among donors showed that infection was more common among young men than suggested by national reporting of AIDS cases. Anti-HIV-1 prevalence varied among the four metropolitan areas less than did reported AIDS cases, but, by 1987, the differences in the latter had decreased. Anti-HIV-1 prevalence in collection areas outside of the four major cities differed much more widely than that among the cities themselves. The TSS/NHLBI Donor Repository will remain available for the indefinite future for further evaluation of screening procedures for HIV-1 and other viruses for which transfusion is found to be an important route of transmission."
1297,0.002,2.0,"Cross-sectional analyses have demonstrated an association between use of hormonal contraceptives and shedding of herpes simplex virus (HSV). This prospective study evaluated the effect of initiating use of hormonal contraception on cervical HSV detection. Two hundred women who were seropositive for HSV-2 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 were examined for cervical mucosal HSV by use of quantitative DNA polymerase chain reaction before and after beginning the use of hormonal contraceptives. Cervical HSV was detected in 32 women (16.0%) before initiating and in 25 women (12.5%) after initiating use of hormonal contraception (P=.4). There were no significant differences in HSV shedding among the subgroups of women starting combination oral contraceptives containing both estrogen and progesterone or progesterone-only contraceptives. Among the 54 women who shed HSV at least once, the median change in cervical HSV after initiation of hormonal contraception was -313 copies/swab. In this prospective study, use of hormonal contraceptives did not increase detection of cervical HSV."

4699,0.002,2.0,"During the earlier years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, initial reports described sensorineural hearing loss in up to 49% of individuals with HIV/AIDS. During those years, patients commonly progressed to advanced stages of HIV disease and frequently had neurological complications. However, the abnormalities on pure-tone audiometry and brainstem-evoked responses outlined in small studies were not always consistently correlated with advanced stages of HIV/AIDS. Moreover, these studies could not exclude the confounding effect of concurrent opportunistic infections and syphilis. Additional reports also have indicated that some antiretroviral medications may be ototoxic; thus, it has been difficult to make conclusions regarding the cause of changes in hearing function in HIV-infected patients. More recently, accelerated aging has been suggested as a potential explanation for the disproportionate increase in complications of aging described in many HIV-infected patients; hence, accelerated aging-associated hearing loss may also be playing a role in these patients."
5786,0.002,2.0,"Patients with treated HIV-1-infection experience earlier occurrence of aging-associated diseases, raising speculation that HIV-1-infection, or antiretroviral treatment, may accelerate aging. We recently described an age-related co-methylation module comprised of hundreds of CpGs; however, it is unknown whether aging and HIV-1-infection exert negative health effects through similar, or disparate, mechanisms. We investigated whether HIV-1-infection would induce age-associated methylation changes. We evaluated DNA methylation levels at >450,000 CpG sites in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of young (20-35) and older (36-56) adults in two separate groups of participants. Each age group for each data set consisted of 12 HIV-1-infected and 12 age-matched HIV-1-uninfected samples for a total of 96 samples. The effects of age and HIV-1 infection on methylation at each CpG revealed a strong correlation of 0.49, p<1 x 10(-200) and 0.47, p<1 x 10(-200). Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified 17 co-methylation modules; module 3 (ME3) was significantly correlated with age (cor=0.70) and HIV-1 status (cor=0.31). Older HIV-1+ individuals had a greater number of hypermethylated CpGs across ME3 (p=0.015). In a multivariate model, ME3 was significantly associated with age and HIV status (Data set 1: βage=0.007088, p=2.08 x 10(-9); βHIV=0.099574, p=0.0011; Data set 2: βage=0.008762, p=1.27 x 10(-5); βHIV=0.128649, p=0.0001). Using this model, we estimate that HIV-1 infection accelerates age-related methylation by approximately 13.7 years in data set 1 and 14.7 years in data set 2. The genes related to CpGs in ME3 are enriched for polycomb group target genes known to be involved in cell renewal and aging. The overlap between ME3 and an aging methylation module found in solid tissues is also highly significant (Fisher-exact p=5.6 x 10(-6), odds ratio=1.91). These data demonstrate that HIV-1 infection is associated with methylation patterns that are similar to age-associated patterns and suggest that general aging and HIV-1 related aging work through some common cellular and molecular mechanisms. These results are an important first step for finding potential therapeutic targets and novel clinical approaches to mitigate the detrimental effects of both HIV-1-infection and aging."
9918,0.002,2.0,"Maraviroc (Celsentri; Selzentry) is a CCR5 coreceptor antagonist used in the treatment of CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection. Administered orally twice daily, maraviroc, in combination with optimized background therapy regimens, showed good virological and immunological efficacy over 48 weeks in antiretroviral treatment-experienced patients aged > or = 16 years with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection, in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, MOTIVATE 1 and MOTIVATE 2 studies. Initial data indicate that the efficacy of maraviroc in this patient population is sustained for up to 96 weeks. In the MERIT study in antiretroviral therapy-naive patients aged > or = 16 years with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection, maraviroc was noninferior to efavirenz (each in combination with zidovudine/lamivudine) for one primary virological endpoint (HIV-1-RNA levels < 400 copies/mL), but not for the other primary endpoint (HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL) in the primary analysis at 48 weeks. However, in a subsequent analysis, which used a more sensitive tropism testing assay than the one originally used and retrospectively excluded patients with non CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection who were ineligible for inclusion in the study, maraviroc demonstrated noninferiority to efavirenz on both primary virological endpoints. Maraviroc showed sustained virological efficacy in this patient population and improved immunological markers for up to 96 weeks. Maraviroc was generally well tolerated by both treatment-experienced and treatment-naive patients with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection. Thus, maraviroc, as a component of antiretroviral combination therapy regimens, is an important option for use in treatment-experienced adults with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection. Available data indicate that maraviroc may also have a role in treatment-naive adults with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection, a population in whom CCR5-tropic HIV-1 is often the major quasispecies."

1128,0.002,2.0,"Although improving health outcomes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons has been identified as a national priority, little is known about the factors associated with hospitalizations of HIV-infected persons in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. Since the introduction of HAART in 1996, there has been a dramatic increase in the life expectancy of HIV-infected persons. However, aging and the long term use of HIV medications have led to an increased incidence of chronic, non-HIV-related illnesses. To improve patient outcomes, the factors that contribute to co-morbidities in HIV-infected persons need to be identified. As a first step, we will summarize the current literature on causes and contributing factors of hospitalizations in adults infected with HIV in the HAART era. "
2949,0.002,2.0,"The relevance of the accessory vpr, vpu, and nef genes for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in human lymphoid tissue (HLT), the major site of viral replication in vivo, is largely unknown. Here, we show that an individual deletion of nef, vpr, or vpu significantly decreases HIV-1 replication and prevents CD4+ T-cell depletion in ex vivo HLT. However, only combined defects in all three accessory genes entirely disrupt the replicative capacity of HIV-1. Our results demonstrate that nef, vpr, and vpu are all essential for efficient viral spread in HLT, suggesting an important role in AIDS pathogenesis."
4261,0.002,2.0,"The cytosine analog 2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC) has been shown to be an effective treatment for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, several liver transplant patients who were undergoing treatment with 3TC for HBV infection experienced a breakthrough of virus while on 3TC. The predominant virus found in these patients' sera contained either a valine or isoleucine for the methionine in the highly conserved YMDD nucleotide binding site in the HBV polymerase. To determine the biological relevance of the Met-to-Val substitution, we mutated a plasmid that contained a cDNA copy of the HBV pregenomic RNA such that when virus replication occurred during transient transfection of HepG2 cells, an M539V polymerase variant was produced. We found that in transiently transfected cells, this variant was approximately 330-fold less sensitive to the antiviral effects of 3TC and produced 7-fold less viral DNA than the wild type."
8762,0.002,2.0,"Abstract While the Internet has the potential to educate persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), websites may contain inaccurate information and increase the risk of nonadherence with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The objectives of our study were to determine the extent to which PLWHA engage in Internet health information seeking behavior (IHISB) and to determine whether IHISB is associated with ART adherence. We conducted a survey of adult, English-speaking HIV-infected patients at four HIV outpatient clinic sites in the United States (Baltimore, Maryland; Detroit, Michigan; New York, and Portland, Oregon) between December 2004 and January 2006. We assessed IHISB by asking participants how much information they had received from the Internet since acquiring HIV. The main outcome was patient-reported ART adherence over the past three days. Data were available on IHISB for 433 patients, 334 of whom were on ART therapy. Patients had a mean age of 45 (standard error [SE] 0.45) years and were mostly male (66%), African American (58%), and had attained a high school degree (73%). Most (55%) reported no IHISB, 18% reported some, and 27% reported ""a fair amount"" or ""a great deal."" Patients who reported higher versus lower levels of IHISB were significantly younger, had achieved a higher level of education, and had higher medication self-efficacy. In unadjusted analyses, higher IHISB was associated with ART adherence (odds ratio [OR], 2.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-6.94). This association persisted after adjustment for age, gender, race, education, clinic site, and medication self-efficacy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.76, 95% CI 1.11-6.87). Our findings indicate that IHISB is positively associated with ART adherence even after controlling for potentially confounding variables. Future studies should investigate the ways in which Internet health information may promote medication adherence among PLWHA."
9654,0.002,2.0,"The increased prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) intersubtype recombinants (ISRs) is shaping HIV-1 evolution throughout the world and will have an impact on both therapeutic and vaccine strategies. This study was designed to generate and compare in vitro ISRs to those isolated from HIV-infected individuals throughout the world. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were dually infected with seven pairs of HIV-1 isolates from different subtypes (i.e., A to F). Recombinant crossover sites were mapped to specific regions in the envelope (env) gene by using a cloning-hybridization technique and subtype-specific probes. In vitro intersubtype recombination was at least twofold more frequent in the V1-to-V3 region than in any other env fragment, i.e., C1 to V1, V3 to V5, or V5 to gp41. Sequence and recombination site analyses suggested the C2 env domain as a ""hot region"" for recombination and selection of replication-competent ISRs during the 15-day incubation. In addition to these regional preferences for env recombination, homopolymeric nucleotide tracts, i.e., sequences known to pause reverse transcriptase and promote template switching, were found in most in vitro crossover sites. ISRs, originating from recent dual infections and limited transmission events, partly retained this in vitro regional or sequence preference for recombination sites. However, a shift to crossover sites flanking the gp120-coding sequence was evident in the stable circulating recombinant forms of HIV-1. Based on these findings, HIV-1 recombinants generated from these dual infections may be used as a model for in vivo intersubtype recombination and for the design of various diagnostic assays and vaccine constructs."
3803,0.002,2.0,"Our objective was to map serial patterns of Western blot reactivity over time of a cohort of initially ELISA-negative, Western blot-indeterminate individuals from a high-risk group and to determine if these individuals were at increased risk of harboring occult HIV-1 infection. A 2-year prospective study used serial ELISA, two types of Western blot, immunologic profiles, HIV-1 culture, and analysis by polymerase chain reaction. Subjects were 20 ELISA-negative, Western blot indeterminate homosexual volunteers and 20 matched seronegative controls. Results showed that 19 of 20 study subjects completed a mean of 17.0 months of clinical and laboratory follow-up. Reactivities with p24 and/or with p55 were the two most commonly observed Western blot patterns, occurring in 70% of individuals. Specific Western blot reactivity was dependent upon the particular immunoblot preparation being used and varied considerably on a longitudinal basis. No individual pattern appeared predictive of an increased likelihood of subsequent seroconversion to HIV-1 relative to controls. By all other criteria including polymerase chain reaction analysis, samples from 17 of 19 individuals remained negative for HIV-1 at each time point. Two individuals evolved from an indeterminate to a positive Western blot and, simultaneously, from a negative to a positive polymerase chain reaction analysis, during follow-up. Our conclusions were as follows. ELISA-negative, Western blot-indeterminate individuals from a high-risk group show marked variability in immunoblot findings over time, and these patterns do not appear predictive of an increased likelihood of infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
4459,0.002,2.0,"The anti-gp41 virus neutralizing monoclonal antibody 2F5 was infused into chimpanzees, which were then given an intravenous challenge with a primary human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) isolate. In two control animals, the infection was established immediately, as evidenced by positive cell-associated DNA PCR and serum RNA PCR tests within 1 week, seroconversion by 4 weeks, and development of lymphadenopathy in this acute phase. Serum RNA PCR tests were negative in one of the two antibody-infused animals until week 8 and in the other antibody-infused animal until week 12; both animals seroconverted at week 14. The peak of measurable virus-specific serum RNA was delayed until week 16 in one antibody-infused animal. Virus-specific RNA in the other animal did not reach levels comparable to those in the other animals through 1 year of follow-up studies. Virus was isolated from the week 16 blood sample from one infused animal. Virus was not isolated from peripheral blood of the second animal but was isolated from lymph node cells taken at week 36. The infection of untreated chimpanzees with this primary isolate appears robust. Use of this isolate should widen the scope of possible experiments in the chimpanzee model. This antibody infusion study indicates that neutralizing antibody, when present at the time of challenge, affects the timing and level of infection and remains influential after it can no longer be detected in the peripheral circulation. It is possible that preexisting, neutralizing antibodies (passively administered or actively elicited) affect the course of acute-phase virus replication in humans. It remains to be established whether these immunologically mediated early effects will influence the course of HIV-1 disease."
3797,0.002,2.0,"The cellular immune response of seven rhesus macaques immunized with Tween-ether-treated macaque strain of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVMAC) and three non-vaccinated control animals was investigated. Immunization elicited antigen-specific proliferating CD4+ cells in five of seven monkeys. Proliferating T cells were found in all animals protected from a first virus challenge. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were not induced by the immunization. After the second challenge, the four formerly protected animals became infected, despite a strong proliferative CD4+ cell activity in three of them. All animals lost their proliferative activity 2 weeks after infection. After the first challenge four of the six infected animals exhibited a CTL response and after the second challenge, one of four newly infected macaques acquired a CTL response. The five animals with a CTL activity against SIVMAC proteins were protected from severe thrombocytopenia, which appeared in the five CTL-negative animals after infection. Our data show the induction of proliferative T cells by immunization with soluble SIVMAC antigen. This T cell reactivity was found in all animals protected from the first virus challenge, but did not confer protection from the second challenge. Interestingly, the proliferative T cell reactivity disappeared 2 weeks after virus infection. Furthermore a CTL response against viral proteins seems to protect infected animals from severe thrombocytopenia which is an early sign of AIDS in monkeys."
7815,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has many genotypes which are closely associated with the severity of chronic hepatitis and the response to antiviral therapy. Although HCV is essentially hepatotropic, several lines of evidence suggest that this virus can infect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in most patients with chronic HCV infection. However, the methods used previously to detect negative-strand HCV RNA have been questioned, and the PBMC tropism of different HCV genotypes remains unknown. A stringent method was used to investigate the prevalence of positive- and negative-strand HCV RNA in the PBMC of 106 patients with chronic hepatitis C and to analyze the influence of HCV genotype on the tropism of PBMC. HCV type 1b was the predominant strain in the patients. Positive-strand RNA in PBMC was detected in 83 (78%) and 40% had negative-strand RNA. The demographic and clinical features were comparable among different patients grouped by the replication status of HCV in the plasma and PBMC samples. In addition, there was no significant difference of PBMC tropism between type 1b and non-1b HCV. In summary, HCV does indeed infect actively the PBMC of chronic hepatitis C patients and such infection is not correlated to the pathogenesis of liver cell damage. Moreover, the genotype is not associated specifically with PBMC tropism of HCV."
7707,0.002,2.0,"Abstract   Health care utilization for HIV-1-infected patients appears to be declining in the United States as a result of highly active antiviral therapy (HAART); yet the opposite appears true in the HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfected population. The reasons for this difference are not well understood. We examined the rates and reasons for emergency department visits and hospital admissions at an academic tertiary care medical center for HIV/HCV coinfected patients as compared to HIV-1 monoinfected patients, using a retrospective matched cohort study design. HIV/HCV coinfected patients had higher rates of health care utilization (emergency department visits 43.9 versus 7.1 per 100 person-years; hospital admissions 18.2 versus 6.7 per 100 person-years, for HIV coinfected and monoinfected, respectively). This increase was not solely due to liver related events. Instead, comorbidities such as diabetes, renal disease, and psychiatric/substance abuse played a larger role in the health-care utilization in the HIV/HCV coinfected population."
8123,0.002,2.0,"The frequencies of two mutations associated with the development of clinical symptoms upon infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were determined in a cohort of individuals from Moscow. Allelic frequency of the first mutation, CCR2-64I, causing the substitution of valine with isoleucine in the CCR2 chemokine receptor, was 0.1106 (95% confidence interval, 0.0714-0.1498). The frequency of the second mutation the G to A substitution in the 3'-untranslated region of the stromal-derived factor 1 encoding gene, SDF1-3'A, was 0.2125 (95% confidential interval, 0.1608-0.2642). Both values were slightly higher than those obtained earlier for Western European countries. This result can be explained by higher proportion of Asian immigrants, characterized by higher frequencies of these mutations, in the population of Moscow."
6211,0.002,2.0,"Detection of plasma viremia in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected people is indispensable for the diagnosis of seronegative infection as well as for the evaluation of virus activities in vivo. The direct detection of HIV-1 RNA in circulation has been performed by means of reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). As an attempt to establish a highly sensitive assay, we evaluated the effects of two-step amplification with nested primers and double priming of reverse transcription on the sensitivity of RT-PCR. The sensitivity of two-step amplification was 100 times higher than that of one-step amplification. The double priming of reverse transcription further increased the sensitivity of the following two-step amplification 100 times, which appeared to be enough to detect HIV-1 RNA from as little as a 2.2 x 10(-4) TCID50 unit equivalent of culture supernatant of HIV-1-infected cells and a single molecule of HIV-1 gag complementary RNA synthesized by in vitro transcription. By use of this most sensitive assay, we successfully detected HIV-1 RNA in serum or plasma from all 22 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) and 13 out of 14 untreated asymptomatic carriers. Of 43 asymptomatic carriers under the treatment with interferon-alpha or azidothymidine, 17 cases showed negative results, indicating that the virus activity was suppressed by the therapeutics. We also noted the inhibitory effect of heparin on RT-PCR."
2109,0.002,2.0,"We measured human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA in brains of 15 patients who died with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). All had been followed prospectively prior to death; 7 were demented and 8 were not demented. HIV was detected in 13 of 15 brains by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in the remaining 2 by presence of viral RNA or viral antigen. Quantitative PCR showed a wide range in amounts of HIV DNA with no significant difference between brains of demented and nondemented patients. These results suggest that qualitative features of the virus, rather than increased virus load per se, may be responsible for the clinical differences between HIV-infected patients with and without dementia."
8798,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) share routes of transmission. There is limited data on the incidence of active co-infection with HBV and/or HCV in cancer patients infected with HIV in Africa. This was a prospective study based on 34 patients with varied cancer diagnosis, infected with HIV and awaiting cancer therapy in South Africa. HIV viral load, CD4+ cell counts, Alanine-aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were tested. Exposure to HBV and HCV was assessed serologically using commercial kits. Active HBV and/or HCV co-infection was detected using viral specific nested PCR assays. HCV 5'-UTR PCR products were sequenced to confirm active HCV infection. Active viral infection was detected in 64.7% of patients for HBV, 38.2% for HCV, and 29.4% for both HBV and HCV. Occult HBV infection was observed in 63.6% of the patients, while seronegative HCV infection was found in 30.8% of patients. In addition, CD4+ cell count < 350 cells/µl was not a risk factor for increased active HBV, HCV or both HBV and HCV co-infections. A total of 72.7%, 18.2% and 9.1% of the HCV sequences were assigned genotype 5, 1 and 4 respectively.The study revealed for the first time a high active HBV and/or HCV co-infection rate in cancer patients infected with HIV. The findings call for HBV and HCV testing in such patients, and where feasible, appropriate antiviral treatment be indicated, as chemotherapy or radiotherapy has been associated with reactivation of viral hepatitis and termination of cancer therapy."
948,0.002,2.0,"Lamivudine, a novel cytosine analogue, exhibits potent antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in vitro and in vivo. The standard HBV DNA hybridization assay used in phase II clinical studies has a low sensitivity, the detection limit of HBV DNA levels being approximately 10(7) genome equivalents per ml (geq ml-1). In this work we used a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (detection limit approximately 10(3) geq ml-1) to determine HBV DNA levels during a 24-week study of lamivudine in 51 stable chronic hepatitis B patients who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Patients were randomly allocated to receive oral doses of 25, 100 or 300 mg lamivudine once daily. At week 24 the median serum concentration of HBV DNA had fallen from 10(8) to 10(4) geq ml-1, a 4-log median reduction. A trend towards more profound suppression of viral replication with an increased dose of lamivudine was observed. After 12 weeks of therapy, 12% of patients had an HBV DNA level that was undetectable in the PCR assay; this increased to 26% after 24 weeks, while in an additional 20% of patients, HBV DNA decreased to the level of detection of the PCR assay. We conclude that a 24-week course of lamivudine decreases serum HBV DNA to the level of PCR detection in 46% of patients. Such additional viral suppressive activity with higher doses and more protracted lamivudine may be of clinical utility prior to liver transplantation. Further studies are needed to define the degree of virus suppression required in clinical practice, and methods are required to increase the efficacy of virus suppression."
6709,0.002,2.0,"The national blood transfusion policies have been changed significantly in recent years in Turkey. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of HBV, HCV, and HIV in blood donors at the Red Crescent Center in Istanbul and to evaluate the effect of changes in the national blood transfusion policies on the prevalence of these infections. The screening results of 72695 blood donations at the Red Crescent Center in Istanbul between January and December 2007 were evaluated retrospectively. HBsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV-1/2 were screened by microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) method. Samples found to be positive for anti-HIV 1/2 and anti-HCV were confirmed by Inno-Lia HCV Ab III and Inno-Lia HIV I/II Score, respectively. The seropositivity rates for HBsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV-1/2 were determined as 1.76%, 0.07%, and 0.008%, respectively. Compared to the previously published data from Red Crescent Centers in Turkey, it was found that HBV and HCV seroprevalances decreased and HIV seroprevalance increased in recent years. In conclusion, we believe that the drop in HBV and HCV prevalence rates are likely multifactorial and may have resulted from more diligent donor questioning upon screening, a higher level of public awareness on viral hepatitis as well as the expansion of HBV vaccination coverage in Turkey. Another factor to contribute to the decreased prevalence of HCV stems from the use of more sensitive confirmation testing on all reactive results, thereby eliminating a fair amount of false positive cases. Despite similar transmission routes, the increase in HIV prevalence in contrast to HBV and HCV may be linked to the increase in AIDS cases in Turkey in recent years."

We retrospectively studied 252 cases of acute hepatitis B (AHB) admitted in our hospital between 2003-2005; 12 of them (4.76%) had a co-infection with hepatitis D virus. Most of the patients were young males with an urban origin. The route of transmission was unknown in 8/12 cases. Abdominal pain was more frequent during the onset of the disease than in AHB (p < 0.05). A cholestatic pattern was noted in 9 cases. The frequency of severe/ fulminant cases was greater then in AHB. The HBsAg was absent in 3 patients, and the HBV-DNA was present at low levels in 3/12 patients tested. Two patients had HBsAg present 6 month later."

In this paper, we examined a total of 405 HBsAg-negative/HIV-infected patients enrolled from January 2007 to December 2009. Overall, the prevalence of OBI was 5.9% (95% confidence interval (CI(₉₅%): 3.8-8.7%); it was more frequently associated with ""anti-HBc alone"" serological marker (11.3%; adjusted odds ratio = 3.7, CI(₉₅%): 1.4-9.8), although it was also detected in the absence of any HBV serological marker (4.9%; CI(₉₅%): 2.3-9.1%). A low prevalence of anti-HCV-positive patients with OBI was found (3.1%; CI(₉₅%): 0.6-8.7%). HIV RNA plasma levels or other immunological/clinical characteristics were not significantly associated with OBI. All but one occult HBV infections were sustained by genotype D viral strains. OBI is relatively frequent in HIV-infected patients, although it does not seem to exert a relevant clinical impact. Viral genotypes in occult HBV infections reflect those circulating in the Mediterranean area."
6800,0.002,2.0,"Esophageal candidiasis, an opportunistic infection that generally occurs in the latest phases of infection due to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is currently a diagnostic criterion for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). We recently treated one patient for esophageal candidiasis associated not with AIDS but with acute HIV infection. At follow-up 19 months later, he was well and had no symptoms related to infection with HIV. We reviewed nine previously reported cases of esophageal candidiasis associated with acute HIV infection. None of the patients involved had other predisposing illnesses or risk factors for candidiasis. The case described herein, together with those reviewed, supports a revision of the Centers for Disease Control's clinical definition of primary HIV infection to include esophageal candidiasis in the clinical spectrum. Moreover, the value of esophageal candidiasis as a diagnostic criterion for AIDS should be reassessed."
8203,0.002,2.0,"The importance of host cellular immune responses, particularly CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses, in control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection has been demonstrated in many clinical studies. These studies, along with vaccination challenge studies in rhesus macaques, indicate the importance of cellular immune responses against HIV-1. Toward this end, we evaluated anti-HIV-1 cellular immune responses in a cohort of 54 subjects who were chronically infected with HIV-1. By validation of IFN-gamma ELISpot assay, we established a dual cut-off criterion for scoring a positive response. The magnitude and frequency of cellular immune responses were measured against HIV-1 antigens (Gag, Pol, Nef, Rev, and Tat), using synthetic peptides as antigens in ELISpot assay. Here we showed that HIV-1 Gag, Pol, and Nef were frequent targets of T cell responses in these subjects, whereas Tat and Rev were less frequently recognized. We further evaluated the possible association between host cellular immune responses and corresponding plasma viral loads in this cohort. By performing ranking correlation analysis, we demonstrated a positive correlation between host viral loads and ELISpot responses of HIV Gag and Pol in untreated subjects. For the subjects under antiviral regimens, however, we did not find any significant association. Our findings suggest that the high levels of ELISpot responses in chronically infected subjects were reflective of their persistent viral infection."

5917,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients who undergo organ transplantation is a serious illness, associated with progressive and often fatal liver disease. Attempts at eradication of infection with antiviral agents, such as interferon and adenine arabinoside, have produced disappointing results. Similarly, prevention of HBV reinfection with the use of passive immunization with hepatitis B immunoglobulin or a combination of active and passive immunization have not been uniformly successful. We report the successful use of ganciclovir, a synthetic analogue of 2-deoxyguanosine, in a heart transplant patient with active HBV infection. The patient developed decompensated liver disease with ascites, edema, and marked derangement of liver tests despite drastic reduction in immunosuppressive therapy. Ganciclovir therapy was administered intravenously, and the patient showed remarkable improvement with clinical recovery and normalization of the liver tests. Moreover, the serum HBV DNA and hepatitis B e antigen became undetectable. Ganciclovir was a safe and effective treatment of HBV infection in this transplant patient."
9583,0.002,2.0,"Noncirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH) has recently been reported as a liver  complication in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and has been found to be  associated with exposure to didanosine. Here, we describe the case of an HIV-infected patient with  portal hypertension who initially presented with massive ascites and portal vein thrombosis. The  patient's HIV-1 infection was well-controlled with highly active antiretroviral therapy  (lamivudine/didanosine plus nevirapine) for 3 years since its diagnosis in 2007. He had no history  of alcoholism, drug abuse, or liver diseases. An extensive work-up for other possible causes of  liver disease was performed, but the results were inconclusive. In addition to reporting this case,  we have reviewed the literature on didanosine-related NCPH and analyzed the findings of 61 similar  previously reported cases."
5990,0.002,2.0,"HIV-associated obstructive portopathy (HIVOP) is an obstruction of the hepatic microvasculature of unknown origin. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical and paraclinical presentation of the disease and its impact in terms of morbidity. Twenty-nine HIV1-infected patients (average 12 years of infection, nadir of CD4 210/mm, including 7 patients with a history of opportunistic infection) with a biopsy-proven or likely HIVOP have been followed up for an average of 6.1 years. Modes of revelation of the HIVOP were: cytolysis and/or cholestasis (60%), occult (14%) or symptomatic (37%) portal hypertension (esophageal varices 17%, ascites 10%, cytopenia 10%), or fortuitous (8%). Hypoalbuminemia (≤35 g/L) was present in (31%), thrombocytopenia (<150,000 platelets) in 52% and prothrombin rate <70% in 10%. Esophageal varices were detected in 71%. Thrombophilia was present in 23 patients (80%): in head, protein S deficiency (87%). MRI showed in 82% at least 1 morphological abnormality. The average value of the liver stiffness by Fibroscan was 8.3 kPa. During follow-up, there was no radiological improvement, 15 (52%) patients presented with variceal hemorrhage, 10 patients (34%) ascites, 10 (34%) portal vein thrombosis, 7 (24%) an iron deficiency, and 2 (7%) with a protein-losing enteropathy, including 14 patients (48%) with several events. Four patients (14%) were transplanted, 1 (25%) recurred the HIVOP on the graft, and 1 patient is waiting for a transplant. HIVOP is a severe disease associated with high morbidity related to symptomatic portal hypertension, which occurred in 50% and required liver transplantation in 14%."
1162,0.002,2.0,"A new inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been isolated and purified to homogeneity from the seeds and fruits of the Momordica charantia. This compound, MAP 30 (Momordica Anti-HIV Protein), is a basic protein of about 30 kDa. It exhibits dose-dependent inhibition of cell-free HIV-1 infection and replication as measured by: (i) quantitative focal syncytium formation on CEM-ss monolayers; (ii) viral core protein p24 expression; and (iii) viral-associated reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in HIV-1 infected H9 cells. The doses required for 50% inhibition (ID50) in these assays were 0.83, 0.22 and 0.33 nM, respectively. No cytotoxic or cytostatic effects were found under the assay conditions. These data suggest that MAP 30 may be a useful therapeutic agent in the treatment of HIV-1 infections. The sequence of the N-terminal 44 amino acids of MAP 30 has been determined."
6237,0.002,2.0,"The effect of 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated giant cell formation was studied in vitro. For this purpose we developed a coculture system using Molt-4 and its virus-producing cell, Molt-4/HTLV-III, which induced syncytia very efficiently. Treatment of the cocultures with 1 and 5 microM of AZT did not inhibit induction of multinucleated giant cells, although only 0.1 microM AZT resulted in almost complete inhibition of HIV replication in Molt-4 cells by cell-free virus infection. This was also evidenced by the assays for viral antigen-positive cells, reverse transcriptase activity, and virus particles released from cell cultures after AZT treatment. When the cocultures were treated with 1% neutralizing antibody (NA) from HIV-infected individuals alone, giant cell formation was inhibited to some extent. However, the concomitant treatment of culture with AZT and NA resulted in much stronger inhibition of giant cell formation. The amount of CD4 antigens on the surface of cells was reduced greatly in the HIV producer cells (Molt-4, H9, and MT-4 cells) as compared to their HIV-free counterparts. These data suggest that (1) both CD4 antigen and viral antigens on the surface of cells play central roles in the induction of multinucleated giant cells and (2) AZT is more effective in inhibition of viral spread in patients with higher NA, probably at an earlier stage of the disease than in patients with lower NA titer."
3484,0.002,2.0,"The development of an unusual case of primary pleural effusion in a 90-year-old human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative Japanese woman with no identifiable tumor mass has been described. Pleural effusion specimens contained large diffuse lymphoma cells, with the phenotype and genotype of a B-cell lineage (positive for CD20, CD79a and clonal rearrangement of Ig heavy chain) and the c-myc gene rearrangement, but were negative for T-cell markers (CD45RO and CD3). The patient was negative for human herpes virus 8 (HHV8), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1). The patient died of respiratory failure 5 months after the diagnosis of primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and an autopsy was performed. Autopsy findings revealed no evidence of tumor mass or bone marrow involvement of lymphoma cells. This case has been considered as a PEL in a HIV-, HHV8-, EBV- and HCV-negative patient. Although cytomorphology of lymphoma cells was classified as large-cell lymphoma in this case, it is interesting that the present case may represent an unusual subset of Burkitt-like disease because of clear B-cell phenotype and c-myc gene rearrangement."
8741,0.002,2.0,"To assess the clinical, immunological and virological evolution in HIV-1 infected patients with CD4 T-cell count above 500/mm3, a historical cohort of 202 untreated and 96 patients treated with HAART was longitudinally studied (median follow-up 36 months). Fourteen untreated and 2 treated patients experienced clinical progression (p = 0.09). The difference between baseline CD4 T-cell count and after 3 years, was -240/mm3 in the untreated group +19/mm3 in the HAART group (p < 10(-3)). A better immunological outcome was significantly associated with a HIV sexual contamination (p = 0.01), HAART (p = 0.01), high baseline CD4 T-cell count (p < 10(-3)) and low baseline HIV viral load (p = 0.01). In the HAART group, the incidence rate of antiretroviral modification due to tolerance difficulties was 0.23+/-0.36/patient year. A sustained undetectable HIV viral load was correlated with a low baseline HIV viral load (p = 0.003) and to be antiretroviral naive (p < 10(-3)). Thus, HAART provide a better immunological outcome in patients with high CD4 T-cell count. However, the CD4 decay slope after 3 years, the risk of therapeutic side-effects and the low risk of clinical progression do not support systematic treatment of those patients."
2471,0.002,2.0,"Toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) continues to be a severe health problem despite the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). To identify predictors for development of TE we compared demographic, clinical and diagnostic variables in AIDS patients with TE before (n = 102) or after the introduction (n = 70) of HAART at the Charité University Medicine in Berlin, Germany. Interestingly, patient characteristics did not differ significantly in the pre- and post-HAART groups. Sixty-eight percent of patients had CD4-cell counts of <50/μl. Outcome after treatment with pyrimethamin plus sulfonamides or clindamycin (47% each) did not differ; adverse reactions were more frequent in patients receiving sulfonamides than in those receiving clindamycin (25% vs. 10.5%; p = 0.02). Interestingly, patients in the post HAART group had not received (82.9%) or had not taken HAART adequately (17.1%). Concurrent diagnosis of TE and HIV was significantly more often in the post- compared to the pre-HAART group (49 vs. 26%, respectively; p > 0.001). Thus, despite the introduction of HAART, awareness of opportunistic infections in HIV patients is warranted. High rates of unawareness of HIV infection should make public health efforts focus on early identification of HIV infection and initiation of and compliance with HAART."
6542,0.002,2.0,"We analyzed immune responses in chronically HIV-infected individuals who took part in a treatment interruption (TI) trial designed for patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy within 6 months of seroconversion. In the 2 subjects who exhibited the best viral control, we detected CD8(+) T-cell responses against 1-2 Gag epitopes during the early weeks of TI and a subsequent increase in the number of epitopes recognized by the later time points. Each of these subjects developed mutations within the epitopes targeted by the highest magnitude responses. In the subject with the worst viral control, we detected responses against 2 Gag epitopes throughout the entire TI and no Gag mutations. The magnitude of these responses increased dramatically with time, greatly exceeding those detected in the virologic controllers. The highest levels of contemporaneous autologous neutralizing antibody activity were detected in the virologic controllers, and a subsequent escape mutation developed within the envelope gene of one controller that abrogated the response. These data suggest that immune escape mutations are a sign of viral control during TI, and that the absence of immune escape mutations in the presence of high levels of viral replication indicates the lack of an effective host immune response."
8270,0.002,2.0,"We report the first case in the literature of human infection with Rhodococcus erythropolis in an HIV-positive patient. A 24-year-old bisexual flight attendant had severe HIV-associated immunodeficiency with a CD4 cell count of 0.02 G/l. He complained of multiple subcutaneous nodules at different sites on the extremities. Biopsy of one node at his left knee revealed granulomatous inflammation filled with acid-fast rods. These bacteria were identified as Rhodococcus erythropolis. The disseminated infection was restricted to the skin and showed a slow response to long-term therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. No relapse has been observed more than 6 months after discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. The etiology of a concomitant polyarthritis remains unknown; a relationship with the rhodococcus infection is possible as the arthritis responded well to the antibiotic therapy and did not reactivate after discontinuation of antibiotics. Due to the difficult isolation technic, this pathogen may be overlooked in routine diagnostic procedures. The implications in clinical practice are discussed."
8193,0.002,2.0,"We describe a North American human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patient with Strongyloides stercoralis infection of the gastrointestinal tract, who required repeated ""standard"" courses of thiabendazole. Pulmonary infection with numerous roundworms developed, as suspected by bronchoalveolar lavage, and while he was receiving therapy, dissemination occurred. On autopsy, S stercoralis was recovered in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, lung, and heart. After a literature review, we conclude that HIV-positive patients have a higher risk of dissemination and ""standard"" treatment failure. This may occur without elevation of IgE or eosinophilia. Those patients may require prolonged courses of thiabendazole or alternatively ivermectin therapy."
794,0.002,2.0,"To explore the role of informal caregivers in adherence, we compared adherence reports by caregivers to those of care recipients. We identified individual-level and relationship factors associated with agreement between caregivers' reports of recipients' adherence and assessed viral suppression. Participants were care recipients, who were on ART and had ever injected drugs, and their caregivers (N = 258 dyads). Nearly three-fourths of caregivers' reports of recipients' ART adherence agreed with recipients' viral suppression status. Agreement was associated with recipient age and expressing affection or gratitude to the caregiver, caregiver's having been close to someone who died of HIV/AIDS, and caregiver's fear of caregiving-related HIV (re)infection, while it was negatively associated with recipient's limited physical functioning. Our findings support the utility of caregiver proxy reports of care recipients' ART adherence and suggest ways to identify and promote HIV caregiver attention to and support of this vulnerable population's ART adherence.

4572,0.002,2.0,"The prevalence of anemia in HIV-infected persons has not been well characterized in the HAART era. In a single-center, retrospective study, anemia prevalence and risk factors, including use of HAART, were assessed in an ambulatory clinical cohort of 758 HIV-infected patients for the calendar year 2000. The relationships between anemia (hemoglobin level less than 12.5 g/dL) and demographic variables, antiretroviral treatment regimens, and disease markers were analyzed. Mean baseline patient characteristics were hemoglobin level, 13.7 +/- 1.9 g/dL; CD4+ cell count, 405 +/- 293/microL; and HIV RNA level, 77,841 +/- 148,394 copies/mL. Overall anemia prevalence was 30.3%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that anemia was associated with a CD4+ cell count below 50/microL, female sex, black race, a viral load above 100,000 copies/mL, zidovudine use, and older age. Severe anemia was less prevalent in this study population than in historical comparators; however, mild to moderate anemia rates remain high."
9514,0.002,2.0,"Twenty (18%) of 111 Peruvian men with sexually acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection were found also to be infected with human T-lymphotrophic virus type I or II in a retrospective study. At the time of data evaluation, 75 patients had reached Centers for Disease Control stage IV (clinical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and had not received antiviral medication; mortality in this group was 63.3% (38/60) among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus alone and 80% (12/15) in the dually infected group. Of the 50 patients who had died, survival time from onset of stage IV to death was shorter in the dually infected group (5.02 +/- 3.27 months) than in those with human immunodeficiency virus infection alone (10.07 +/- 4.42 months). In Peru, sexually acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection in men is often accompanied by human T-lymphotrophic virus type I/II infection, and dual retrovirus infection is associated with a shorter survival after onset of clinical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."
6972,0.002,2.0,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major global issue, because an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma among patients infected with HBV is well established. Recently, it has been suggested that HBV is associated with other human cancers. However, the association between HBV and the risk of onset of hematological malignancies remains controversial. The aim of this large-scale retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the association between HBV infection and hematological malignancies. A retrospective analysis of 86,115 newly admitted patients at Shanghai Ruijin Hospital was performed. A cohort of patients previously exposed to HBV (n = 1,874) and a cohort of individuals without a positive test for anti-hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc; n = 45,118) were compared to assess the risk of hematological malignancies. Anti-HBc was positive in 61.2% cases and 54.3% controls (p = 0.0001). The risk of B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and multiple myeloma was higher in the HBV-infected cohort than in the non-HBV-infected cohort. In conclusion, patients infected with HBV have a substantially increased risk of hematological malignancies."
2749,0.002,2.0,"Pneumonia is one of the most frequent complications in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-patients with Pneumocystis carinii as the leading cause. The true prevalence of atypical agents such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, C. trachomatis, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in this population of patients is unknown as the currently used method for diagnosing these agents is measurement of antibody levels. However, this method is of limited value in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients who may have a compromised antibody response. To evaluate the prevalence of Chlamydia spp., Legionella spp. and M. pneumoniae in HIV-infected patients with pulmonary disease, this retrospective study has applied inhibitor-controlled polymerase chain reaction analyses on 103 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids representing 103 episodes of pneumonia in 83 HIV-positive patients. L. pneumophila was detected in 1% of the BAL fluids and M. pneumoniae was found as a coexisting pathogen in 2% of the samples. Chlamydia spp. could not be detected in any of the BAL fluids. By culture and staining methods 106 other microorganisms were detected with P. carinii and Streptococcus pneumoniae as the most frequently occurring. Pneumonia due to Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila or Mycoplasma pneumoniae seems to be rare in Danish human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, but might be considered as a possible cause in cases of treatment failure."

Because of repeated flares, administration of lamivudine was started in March 2002. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA immediately decreased, but the serum level of alanine aminotransferase gradually increased. Drug-induced hepatitis due to lamivudine was excluded. It was suspected that the progression of liver damage was caused by hepatitis delta virus (HDV), because the patient was positive for both anti-HDV antibody and HDV RNA. Co-infection of HDV should be considered a possibility if liver injury is not improved by lamivudine therapy."
9467,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is characterized by the massive infiltration of secondary lymphoid organs with activated CD8(+) T lymphocytes. While converging data indicated that these cells were HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) responsible for HIV spread limitation, direct evidence was lacking. Here, the presence of HIV-specific effector CTLs was demonstrated directly ex vivo in 15 of 24 microdissected splenic white pulps from an untreated patient and in 1 of 24 tonsil germinal centers from a second patient with incomplete viral suppression following bitherapy. These patients had plasma HIV RNA loads of 5900 and 820 copies per milliliter. The frequencies of HIV-1 DNA(+) cells in their lymphoid organs were more than 1 in 50 and 1 in 175, respectively. Spliced viral messenger RNA (a marker for ongoing viral replication) was present in most immunocompetent structures tested. Conversely, CTL activity was not found in spleens from 2 patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy, with undetectable plasma viral load. These patients had much lower spleen DNA(+) cell frequencies (1 in 2700 and 1 in 3800) and no white pulps containing spliced RNA. CTL effector activity as well as spliced viral messenger RNA were both concentrated in the white pulps and germinal centers. This colocalization indicates that viral replication in immunocompetent structures of secondary lymphoid organs triggers anti-HIV effector CTLs to these particular locations, providing clues to target therapeutic intervention."
7109,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are currently hyperendemic in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV and AIDS have a special impact on working-age populations, economic resources, certain illnesses, and health care facilities. Assessment of HIV serostatus of hospitalized patients is rarely performed, however, because of a reluctance to intrude on patient confidentiality, a perceived lack of benefit (no antiretroviral therapy is available), and societal denial. We evaluated the effect on health care of HIV testing of patients routinely admitted to medical wards in the 2 major city hospitals in Harare, Zimbabwe. Of 196 patients tested, 58% were HIV positive with strong associations with infectious diseases, and with youth and weight loss, but not with cardiac, pulmonary, endocrinologic, or renal diagnoses, and not with rural versus urban location, occupation, sex, mortality, or cost of hospitalization. The clinical estimate of patients' HIV serostatus was largely inaccurate. Mandatory HIV testing of all hospitalized patients would improve diagnosis of infectious diseases, clarify patient prognosis, allow for individual counseling with regard to HIV prevention, and focus national health efforts by providing alarming, realistic statistics."
6856,0.002,2.0,"To determine role of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and additional factors in incidence and outcome of patients with AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) we retrospectively analyzed 257 cases of AIDS-related NHL (24 low-grade, 168 high-grade B-cell, 6 high-grade T-cell, and 59 primary CNS lymphomas (PCNSL) among 2004 patients with HIV-infection treated at the University Hospital of Frankfurt, Germany from January 1983 to May 1999. Data were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses, using overall survival as end point. Patients received CHOP-like therapy as standard treatment. Until May 1999 incidence of all diagnosed cases of NHL was decreasing (1991-94: 14.2% versus 1995-5/99: 12.8%). Mainly, the incidence of low-grade NHL and PCNSL clearly decreased whereas the incidence of high-grade B-cell NHL increased compared to all diagnosed cases of NHL (1983-86: 53.3% versus 1995-5/99: 78.6%). One-year survival probability of all screened patients with AIDS related NHL was 54%, while 5-year survival rate remained 5%. We found age <25 years, development of NHL in the years before 1990, IVDU, CD4 counts <150/microl, PCNSL as well as NHL as the AIDS index disease, to be highly significant independent predictors of poor survival, including increased hazard ratios. In the era of HAART incidence of NHL is decreasing, mainly the incidence of low-grade NHL and PCNSL. Overall survival of patients has been prolonged with HAART. This development is mainly due to improvement of antiretroviral therapy, rather than to any fundamental changes in the chemotherapeutic treatment of NHL. Therefore, new treatment approaches for AIDS-related NHL should focus on more efficient antiretroviral therapy in association with combination chemotherapy."

HIV-associated nephropathy occurs less frequently in the era of antiretroviral therapy. HIV immune complex kidney disease is being diagnosed more frequently, but the term is currently used to refer to a heterogeneous group of kidney diseases. Comorbid chronic kidney disease poses a growing burden in HIV-infected persons due to an overrepresentation of risk factors such as black race, diabetes, hypertension, and coinfection with hepatitis C virus.

2568,0.002,2.0,"Background Portugal has the highest prevalence rate of HIV infection in Western Europe. The proportion of patients with a late diagnosis, carried out in full-blown AIDS stage, remains high. Skin and mucous membrane manifestations are not rare in these patients. Objective A demographic, clinical, and laboratorial characterization of patients with de novo HIV infection diagnosis made in the Department of Dermatology and Venereology of a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. Methods Retrospective review of medical records of adult patients newly diagnosed with HIV infection (reactive immunoassay for antibodies to HIV-1/HIV-2 or HIV p24 antigen) in the Dermatology and Venereology Department of a Portuguese central hospital in the period between January 2005 and December 2013. Results During the study period, 97 new cases were diagnosed, 70 men and 27 women. The median age at diagnosis was 36 years. Of the total, 50 cases were diagnosed with a concomitant sexually transmitted infection (STI), more frequently syphilis and ano-genital HPV infection. The remaining 47 patients were diagnosed with other dermatological conditions such as prurigo nodularis, psoriasis, and Kaposi's sarcoma. The duration of complaints that lead to medical attention ranged from <1 week to 8 years, being significantly lower in patients diagnosed with a concomitant STI ( p < 0.01). Basal viral load was also lower in this group of patients ( p < 0.05). Of all the new diagnosed cases, 80% of patients are currently retained in care. Conclusion This study grants a descriptive overview of de novo HIV infection diagnoses performed by dermatovenereologists in a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. As in the past, the importance of Dermato-Venereology for HIV infection diagnosis remains present in daily clinical practice."
8850,0.002,2.0,"The vif gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is essential for the productive infection of primary blood-derived lymphocytes, macrophages, and certain human T-cell lines. It has been shown that Vif is associated with HIV-1 virions purified by sucrose density-equilibrium gradient analysis. However, the specificity of Vif incorporation into virions has not been determined. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that standard HIV-1 particle preparations created with sucrose density-equilibrium gradients are contaminated with cell-derived microvesicles. Here we demonstrate, as previously reported, that Vif cosediments with HIV-1 particles in sucrose density-equilibrium gradient analysis. However, we also found that, when Vif was expressed in the absence of all other HIV-1-encoded gene products and then isolated by sucrose density-equilibrium gradient centrifugation from extracellular supernatants, its sedimentation pattern was largely unaltered, suggesting that Vif can be secreted from cells. Using a newly developed OptiPrep velocity gradient method, we were able to physically separate most of the extracellular Vif from the HIV-1 virions without disrupting the infectivity of the virus. By titrating serial dilutions of purified Vif and Gag against the viral peak fraction in the OptiPrep gradient, we demonstrate that <1.0 Vif molecule per virion was present. This study shows that Vif is not significantly present in HIV-1 virions, a finding which is consistent with the idea that Vif functions predominantly in the virus-producing cells during virus assembly. The OptiPrep velocity gradient technique described here could be an easy and rapid way to purify HIV and other enveloped viruses from microvesicles and/or cell debris."
3156,0.002,2.0,"Many individuals chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) experience a recrudescence of plasma virus during continuous combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) due either to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses or to poor compliance. In most cases, virologic failure on ART is associated with a coincident decline in CD4(+) T lymphocyte levels. However, a proportion of discordant individuals retain a stable or even increasing CD4(+) T lymphocyte count despite virological failure. In order to address the nature of these different outcomes, we evaluated virologic and immunologic variables in a prospective, single-blinded, nonrandomized cohort of 53 subjects with chronic HIV-1 infection who had been treated with continuous ART and monitored intensively over a period of 19 months. In all individuals with detectable viremia on ART, multiple drug resistance mutations with similar impacts on viral growth kinetics were detected in the pol gene of circulating plasma virus. Further, C2V3 env gene analysis demonstrated sequences indicative of CCR5 coreceptor usage in the majority of those with detectable plasma viremia. In contrast to this homogeneous virologic pattern, comprehensive screening with a range of antigens derived from HIV-1 revealed substantial immunologic differences. Discordant subjects with stable CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts in the presence of recrudescent virus demonstrated potent virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. In contrast, subjects with virologic failure associated with declining CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts had substantially weaker HIV-specific CD4(+) T lymphocyte responses and exhibited a trend towards weaker HIV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. Importantly the CD4(+) response was sustained over periods as long as 11 months, confirming the stability of the phenomenon. These correlative data lead to the testable hypothesis that the consequences of viral recrudescence during continuous ART are modulated by the HIV-specific cellular immune response."
8166,0.002,2.0,"Increased treatment options that are more efficacious and safe and new knowledge on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection have expanded the indications for therapy in hepatitis B. The question is no longer ""Who should be treated?"" but ""When should treatment be initiated?"" Treatment is clearly indicated in patients with life-threatening liver disease (acute liver failure, decompensated cirrhosis, or severe hepatitis flare) and in those with compensated cirrhosis and high levels of serum HBV DNA. For patients with precirrhotic liver disease, treatment indications should be based on clinical, biochemical, or histological evidence of liver disease, such as elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, abnormal histology, and high levels of serum HBV DNA. The cutoff for ALT and HBV DNA values are constantly being revised and should be set at a lower level for older patients who may have been infected for a longer period of time. High serum HBV DNA levels persisting for a few decades are associated with increased risk of clinical outcomes, but there is insufficient data to support the initiation of treatment based on high serum HBV DNA alone, particularly in young patients, those with persistently normal ALT levels, and those with a single high HBV DNA level. The decision to initiate treatment at the time of assessment or to defer treatment should take into consideration other factors such as desire to start a family, occupational requirement, family history of hepatocellular carcinoma, access to care and insurance coverage, and commitment to long-term treatment and medication compliance. All patients who are not initiated on treatment should continue to be monitored so treatment can be started if and when the indication arises."
1523,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and viral antigens were simultaneously identified by immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver sections followed by in situ hybridisation. In the developed radioautographs, silver grains indicate the location of viral DNA in the cell and the immunohistochemical stain marks sites of accumulation of viral antigen. In liver from a patient with chronic active hepatitis serologically positive for hepatitis B surface antigen and e antigen (HBsAg/HBeAg) viral nucleotide sequences, representing actively replicating DNA species, were demonstrated predominantly in the cytoplasm. Viral core antigen (HBcAg) was expressed in the liver cell nuclei. HBcAg was not detectable in most hepatocytes with high levels of viral replication. Conversely, most liver cells in which HBcAg was found did not contain replicating HBV. HBcAg and replicating viral DNA species were not detectable in hepatocytes undergoing pathological changes, such as ground glass cells. Because no pathological changes could be identified either in hepatocytes with high levels of HBV replication or expression of nuclear HBcAg, the liver cell damage in this patient with chronic hepatitis B was presumably induced by other mechanisms. The simultaneous observation of viral DNA, antigens, and pathological changes at the single cell level and their correlation with clinical findings should contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HBV-induced liver cell injury."
2718,0.002,2.0,"We examined prospectively the influence of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection on the histopathological features and clinical outcome of HCV RNA-positive chronic hepatitis (CH-C) and detected hepatitis B core (HBc) particles in hepatocytes. The subjects were 468 patients with CH-C or liver cirrhosis (LC) who were negative for serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HBV DNA was detected in serum by nested PCR. HBsAg and HBc antigen (HBcAg) in liver were investigated using immunohistochemical techniques and light (LM) and electron microscopy (EM). Serum HBV DNA was detected in 43.6% of the patients studied. There were no significant differences between HBV DNA-positive and DNA-negative patients in terms of their clinical profiles. For HBV DNA-positive patients, the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration and irregular regeneration of hepatocytes was significantly greater than for HBV DNA-negative patients. The cumulative probability of development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was significantly higher for HBV DNA-positive patients than for HBV DNA-negative patients. HBV DNA positivity was a risk factor for the occurrence of HCC according to multivariate analysis. HBsAg and HBcAg were detected in 8.5 and 72.3%, respectively, of the livers of serum HBV DNA-positive individuals. Core particles were detected in the nuclei of the hepatocytes by IEM. The histopathological features and long-term outcome of CH-C or LC could be affected by occult HBV infection."
8611,0.002,2.0,"Approximately 50% of late-stage HIV patients develop CXCR4-tropic (X4) virus in addition to CCR5-tropic (R5) virus. X4 emergence occurs with a sharp decline in CD4+ T cell counts and accelerated time to AIDS. Why this phenotypic switch to X4 occurs is not well understood. Previously, we used numerical simulations of a mathematical model to show that across much of parameter space a promising new class of antiretroviral treatments, CCR5 inhibitors, can accelerate X4 emergence and immunodeficiency. Here, we show that mathematical model to be a minimal activation-based HIV model that produces a spontaneous switch to X4 virus at a clinically-representative time point, while also matching in vivo data showing X4 and R5 coexisting and competing to infect memory CD4+ T cells. Our analysis shows that X4 avoids competitive exclusion from an initially fitter R5 virus due to X4v unique ability to productively infect nave CD4+ T cells. We further justify the generalized conditions under which this minimal model holds, implying that a phenotypic switch can even occur when the fraction of activated nave CD4+ T cells increases at a slower rate than the fraction of activated memory CD4+ T cells. We find that it is the ratio of the fractions of activated nave and memory CD4+ T cells that must increase above a threshold to produce a switch. This occurs as the concentration of CD4+ T cells drops beneath a threshold. Thus, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which increases CD4+ T cell counts and decreases cellular activation levels, inhibits X4 viral growth. However, we show here that even in the simplest dual-strain framework, competition between R5 and X4 viruses often results in accelerated X4 emergence in response to CCR5 inhibition, further highlighting the potential danger of anti-CCR5 monotherapy in multi-strain HIV infection."
7610,0.002,2.0,"Total body x-irradiation has been utilized in the treatment of several human diseases, including leukemia, where it is followed by bone marrow transplantation, and in some autoimmune disorders. Recently, it was reported that total body irradiation appeared useful in the treatment of Friend leukemia virus infection in mice. In this report, the effect of x-irradiation on the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro in CD4+ cells was examined. MT-4 cells and HIV strain human T cell lymphotropic virus Type IIIB were used to conduct this study. Infected MT-4 cells were irradiated at the time of infection or following infection with x-ray doses of 25-300 cGy. Doses of 50, 150, and 300 cGy enhanced HIV replication by 1.6-, 2-, and 4.8-fold, respectively. Irradiating the cells prior to infection also resulted in similar enhancement of HIV replication. This phenomenon was also observed with wild-type HIV isolates grown in peripheral blood mononuclear and in HIV chronically infected cells. In addition, the enhancement was associated with a radiation-induced increase in intracellular levels of cAMP. The use of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A inhibitor, H-8, inhibited HIV replication by 65%. These data suggest that in vitro exposure to low doses of x-ray enhances HIV replication partially via a cAMP-dependent pathway."

Thirty-six subjects participated. The median minimum concentration in plasma (C(min)) for indinavir administered at 1,200 mg q12h was 88.1 nM (interquartile range [IR], 61.7 to 116.5 nM), whereas the median C(min) for indinavir administered at 1,000 mg q8h was 139.3 nM (IR, 68.8 to 308.7 nM) (P = 0.19). Compared to the minimum C(min) range for wild-type virus (80 to 120 ng/ml) estimated by the AACTG Adult Pharmacology Committee, the C(min) for indinavir administered at 1,200 mg q12h (54 ng/ml) is inadequate. The apparent oral clearance (CL/F) (P = 0.28), apparent volume of distribution at steady state (V(ss)/F) (P = 0.25), and half-life (t(1/2)) (P = 0.80) of indinavir did not differ between regimens. The levels of efavirenz exposure were similar between regimens. For efavirenz administered at 600 mg q24h and 300 mg q12h, the median maximum concentrations in plasma (C(max)s) were 8,968 nM (IR, 5,784 to 11,768 nM) and 8,317 nM (6,587 to 10,239 nM), respectively (P = 0.66), and the C(min)s were 4,289 nM (IR, 2,462 to 5,904 nM) and 4,757 nM (IR, 3,088 to 6,644 nM), respectively (P = 0.29). Efavirenz pharmacokinetic parameters such as CL/F (P = 0.62), V(ss)/F (P = 0.33), and t(1/2) (P = 0.37) were similar regardless of the dosing regimen. The median C(max), C(min), CL/F, V(ss)/F, and t(1/2) for abacavir were 6,852 nM (IR, 5,702 to 7,532), 21.0 nM (IR, 21.0 to 87.5), 43.7 liters/h (IR, 37.9 to 55.2), 153.9 liters (IR, 79.6 to 164.4), and 2.0 h (IR, 1.8 to 2.8), respectively. In summary, when indinavir was given with efavirenz, the trough concentration of indinavir after administration of 1,200 mg q12h was inadequate. Abacavir did not influence the pharmacokinetics or exposure parameters of either indinavir or efavirenz. The levels of efavirenz exposure were similar in subjects receiving efavirenz q12h or q24h."
8029,0.002,2.0,"An estimated one-third of individuals positive for HIV are also infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Chronic infection with HCV can lead to serious liver disease including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver-related disease is among the leading causes of death in patients with HIV, and individuals with HIV and HCV co-infection are found to progress more rapidly to serious liver disease than mono-infected individuals. The mechanism by which HIV affects HCV infection in the absence of immunosuppression by HIV is currently unknown. In a recent article published in BMC Immunology, Qu et al. demonstrated that HIV tat is capable of inducing IP-10 expression. Further, they were able to show that HIV tat, when added to cells, was able to enhance the replication of HCV. Importantly, the increase in HCV replication by tat was found to be dependent on IP-10. This work has important implications for understanding the effect HIV has on the outcome of HCV infection in co-infected individuals. The findings of Qu et al. may inform the design of intervention and treatment strategies for co-infected individuals.Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/13/15."
4570,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-associated dementia (HAD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by HIV infection and replication in brain tissue. HIV-1-infected monocytes overexpress inflammatory molecules that facilitate their entry into the brain. Prostanoids are lipid mediators of inflammation that result from cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity. Because COX-2 is normally induced during inflammatory processes, the aim of this study was to investigate whether COX-2 expression is up-regulated during monocyte-brain endothelium interactions. In vitro cocultures of HIV-infected macrophages and brain endothelium showed an up-regulation of COX-2 expression by both cell types. This up-regulation occurs via an interleukin-1beta (IL1beta)-dependent mechanism in macrophages and via an IL-1beta-independent mechanism in endothelial cells. Thus, interactions between HIV-infected monocytes and brain endothelium result in COX-2 expression and, as such, might contribute to the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection."
3014,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health concern worldwide and only a minority of treated patients develop a sustained protective response following a short course of therapy, and most patients require prolonged treatment to suppress viral replication. However, several recent reports showed that inhibition of certain host cell proteins prevented viral infection, specifically the human abhydrolase domain containing 2 (ABHD2) has been confirmed by our previous study to be upregulated in HepG2.2.15 cells but downregulated by lamivudine. These observations suggested that ABHD2 was important for HBV propagation and could be a target of novel anti-HBV drugs. To assess the importance of ABHD2 to the HBV infection process, antisense oligonucleotides (ASODNs) were used to downregulate ABHD2 expression in HepG2.2.15 cells. From 5 ASODNS candidates tested, AB3 significantly downregulated ABHD2 mRNA and protein expression levels. Further, AB3 significantly reduced HBV DNA, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis B ""e"" antigen protein expression levels in cell medium without affecting cell viability. These results suggest that downregulation of ABHD2 using ASODNs blocked HBV replication and expression without affecting host cell physiology. Further, data demonstrated an essential role of ABHD2 in HBV propagation, suggesting it can serve as a novel target for anti-HBV drug development."

2896,0.002,2.0,"The implementation of hepatitis C (HCV) direct-acting antiviral drugs is prioritized in several populations in which its application provides the most immediate and impactful benefit. In this scenario, a precise knowledge of the situation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV chronic co-infection is required to adequately address this disease. This cross-sectional study was performed in 21 hospitals in Andalusia (Spain). The study population consisted of HIV-infected patients with an active HCV chronic infection who were not receiving HCV treatment at the time of inclusion. A total of 13,506 HIV-infected patients were included in the study. Of them, 2561 (18.9 %) presented chronic HCV infection. The majority of the patients included were on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART; 96.2 %), showed plasma levels with an undetectable HIV viral load (92.5 %), and had a good immunological status (median CD4+ cell count of 486 cells/mL). The HCV genotype distribution was as follows: 58.1 % were genotype 1, 1.1 % were genotype 2, 16.1 % were genotype 3, and 22.1 % were genotype 4 (2.6 % were missing data). In total, 24.8 % of the patients showed liver fibrosis stage F0-F1, 27.9 % showed stage F2, 16.7 % showed stage F3, and 21 % showed stage F4 (9.6 % were missing data). With regards to previous HCV treatment experiences, 68.05 % of the patients were naïve and 31.95 % had failed to respond to a previous treatment. The burden of HCV/HIV co-infected patients in our population was reported as one in five HIV-infected patients requiring HCV treatment. The implementation of extra resources to face this important health challenge is mandatory. "

We report on an HIV/tuberculosis (TB) co-infected patient who developed an immune restoration inflammatory syndrome after initiation of HAART and anti-TB treatment.

Systemic symptoms decreased during corticosteroid treatment, but abscesses only disappeared 8 months after the start of the anti-TB treatment."
9064,0.002,2.0,"HIV-1 envelope-specific CD4+ T cell lines were established simultaneously from PBMC and lymph node mononuclear cells of two HIV-1-infected patients. Three recombinant envelope proteins were used to establish the CD4+ T cell lines: gp160NL4-3, gp120IIIB, and gp120MN. Six T cell lines were established from the first patient, one for each Ag from each compartment, and four T cell lines, two per compartment, were established from the second patient. Each line was challenged with a panel of overlapping peptides spanning the entire gp120 sequence to define its T cell epitope specificity. The pattern of recognition for all the lines from any given patient was similar between compartments. Each patient had a different pattern of peptide recognition. TCR analysis showed a heterogeneous usage of Vbeta between lines with same peptide specificity and established from different compartments. These data suggest that the cellular immune response does not phenotypically vary between the peripheral blood and lymph node compartments, but demonstrates genotypic heterogeneity, showing possible redundancy of the immune response to HIV-1 gp160."
1482,0.002,2.0,"Neutralizing antibody responses against heterologous isolates in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 infections were compared, and their relationships with established clinical markers of progression were examined. Neutralizing responses against 7 heterologous primary isolates and 1 laboratory strain were compared between 32 untreated HIV-1-infected subjects and 35 untreated HIV-2-infected subjects using a pseudotyped reporter virus assay. The breadth of the neutralizing response, defined as the proportion of panel viruses positively neutralized by patient plasma, was significantly greater among HIV-2-infected subjects than among HIV-1-infected subjects. Notably, for fully one-third of HIV-2 subjects, all viruses were effectively neutralized in our panel. Magnitudes of responses, defined as reciprocal 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) titers for positive reactions, were significantly greater among HIV-1-infected subjects than among HIV-2-infected subjects. When plasma samples from HIV-1 patients were tested for cross-neutralization of HIV-2 and vice versa, we found that these intertype responses are very rare and their prevalences comparable in both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection. The significantly higher magnitude of heterologous responses for HIV-1 compared to HIV-2 prompted us to examine associations with viremia, which is known to be significantly higher in HIV-1 infection. Importantly, there was a significant positive correlation between the IC(50) titer and viral load within both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 groups, suggesting heterologous antibodies may be driven by viral replication. We conclude that HIV-2 infection is characterized by a broad, low-magnitude intratype neutralization response, while HIV-1 is characterized by a narrower but higher-magnitude intratype response and that a significant positive association between the IC(50) titer and viremia is common to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections."

We describe a patient with chronic hepatitis B who developed hepatosplenic gamma delta T-cell lymphoma. A 45-year-old woman presented with marked hepatosplenomegaly and hepatic failure during the course of chronic hepatitis B. Peripheral blood examination revealed 57% abnormal lymphoid cells which expressed the gamma delta T-cell receptor. The cytogenetic analysis of tumor cells showed an abnormal karyotype; 47, XX, -13, +2mar in all 20 metaphases examined. A clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor genes was demonstrated by Southern blot analysis, showing monoclonal expansion of tumor cells. A liver biopsy specimen showed fibrosis of the portal areas and sinusoidal infiltration of tumor cells. HBV infection was documented by the presence of IgG anti-HBc and anti-HBs antibodies in serum. Although HBV-DNA was not detected in tumor cells by polymerase chain reaction analysis, there is a possibility that proliferation of gamma delta T cells in response to HBV infection played a role in the pathogenesis of hepatosplenic gamma delta T-cell lymphoma."
1353,0.002,2.0,"A 29-year-old Ghanaian woman who developed AIDS while being HIV-antibody seronegative was investigated during a collaborative study aimed at the identification of viral causes of a HIV-seronegative AIDS syndrome in West Africa. Plasma was screened with a panel of EIA tests for antibodies to HIV and HIV-1 p24 antigen. Retroviral infection was investigated by detection of reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in plasma, viral RNA amplification and quantification, and virus isolation. Positive amplification products were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were carried out. Most EIA tests were unable to demonstrate the presence of anti-HIV anti-bodies, whereas confirmatory assays yielded inconclusive results. Retroviral infection was documented by detection of RT activity, HIV-1-specific genomic amplification and virus isolation. This virus was HIV-1 subtype A with an unusual six amino acid insertion in the gp120 V4 loop and with the nef gene of subtype G. The patient's plasma did not react with either autologous or heterologous viral lysates or HIV-1 peptides, whereas antibodies to other viral antigens were present. In conclusion, the Ghanaian patient exhibited a rare subtype A/G recombinant HIV-1 infection with a near absence of a HIV-specific humoral response. The lack of detectable antibody response might be due to either a highly pathogenic, rapidly fatal, HIV-1 infection preventing the development of the typical humoral immune response or to a host-related dysfunction of the immune system. Direct antigenemia or genomic detection of the virus should be undertaken when clinical or biological data suggests an HIV infection in the absence of serological evidence."

The present study hypothesized that patients from a sexually transmitted infection center in Russia who perpetrated IPV or were victims of IPV would be more likely to have HIV risk behaviors including injection drug use, multiple partners, and inconsistent condom use than those who were not involved with IPV. We used a self-administered questionnaire to collect information from 381 patients on demographics, health status, injection drug use, sexual behaviors, and violence involving sexual partners between 2008 and 2009. After including sociodemographics, lifetime IPV perpetration was significantly associated with having had multiple sexual partners among male patients (odds ratio [OR] = 2.61, p < .05). IPV victimization was significantly associated with injection drug use among male and female patients (OR = 5.22, p < .05) and with inconsistent condom use among female patients (OR = 8.93, p < .05). IPV perpetration and victimization were common among male and female study participants and were associated with greater HIV risk behaviors. HIV prevention programs in Russia should address the risks associated with IPV among people at risk for HIV."
7380,0.002,2.0,"We examined whether engagement in prevention advocacy among HIV clients is associated with their own condom use and HIV care adherence. Longitudinal data merged from three studies in Uganda produced a sample of 1,882 participants who were administered assessments at baseline and months 6 and 12. The measure of prevention advocacy was the mean of two Likert scale items assessing encouragement of others to (1) use condoms, and (2) get HIV tested. In regression analyses controlling for demographics and known correlates of the dependent variables, increased prevention advocacy from baseline to month 12 was significantly associated with increased consistent condom use and marginally associated with increased antiretroviral adherence and clinic attendance. These results suggest that empowering HIV clients to engage in prevention advocacy with others may benefit their own HIV protective behaviors and should be promoted as a component to interventions targeting positive living among people living with HIV.

2509,0.002,2.0,"CD8+ T lymphocytes of HIV-1-infected individuals can efficiently suppress HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T lymphocytes. To elucidate the molecular events underlying this suppression, we have used the HIV-1 LTR directing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (CAT) in transient transfection assays using human Jurkat T cells. In addition to supernatants of patient CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD4+ > 350/microliters), supernatant of a T cell clone derived by Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)-mediated transformation of CD8+ T lymphocytes of a patient demonstrating inhibition of virus replication were examined. Similar levels of inhibition of LTR-mediated gene expression in response to Tat or mitogenic activation with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore were observed by supernatants of both sources. The inhibitory effect of CD8+ T lymphocytes was not exclusive to lentiviral LTRs since transcription of both the HTLV-I LTR and RSV LTR in response to mitogen was effectively inhibited. In examination of the influence of CD8+ T cell-derived supernatant on NF kappa B-mediated activation, a dimer of the HIV-1 NF kappa B elements directing CAT was markedly inhibited by supernatants of both patient CD8+ lymphocytes and the HVS-derived CD8+ clone. Thus the inhibitory nature of CD8+ T lymphocytes appears not to be specific to lentiviral promoters and may mediate an inhibitory effect via the NF kappa B element."
1405,0.002,2.0,"We isolated two template analog reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor-resistant mutants of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 RT by using the DNA aptamer, RT1t49. The mutations associated, N255D or N265D, displayed low-level resistance to RT1t49, while high-level resistance could be observed when both mutations were present (Dbl). Molecular clones of HIV that contained the mutations produced replication-defective virions. All three RT mutants displayed severe processivity defects. Thus, while biochemical resistance to the DNA aptamer RT1t49 can be generated in vitro via multiple mutations, the overlap between the aptamer- and template-primer-binding pockets favors mutations that also affect the RT-template-primer interaction. Therefore, viruses with such mutations are replication defective. Potent inhibition and a built-in mechanism to render aptamer-resistant viruses replication defective make this an attractive class of inhibitors."

In the present study, a panel of anticarbohydrate monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was tested for their ability to inhibit in vitro human immunodeficiency virus infectivity. MAbs against three different N- and O-linked carbohydrate epitopes (LeY, A1, and sialyl-Tn) were able to block infection by cell-free virus as well as inhibit syncytium formation. Inhibition of virus infectivity was independent of virus strain (HTLVIIIB or patient isolate SSI-002), the cell line used for virus propagation (H9 or MT4), and the cell type used as the infection target (MT4, PMC, or selected T4 lymphocytes). Inhibition was observed when viruses were preincubated with MAbs but not when cells were preincubated with MAbs before inoculation, and the MAbs were shown to precipitate 125I-labeled gp120. The MAbs therefore define carbohydrate structures expressed by the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120, indicating that glycans of the viral envelope are possible targets for immunotherapy or vaccine development or both."
4336,0.002,2.0,"Each year, an estimated 20,000 infants are born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive women in the United States. These infants are at high risk for perinatal hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, chronic HBV infection, and associated complications of chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. All vaccine advisory groups recommend that all pregnant women be routinely tested for HBsAg during an early prenatal visit during each pregnancy to determine whether their newborns will require immunoprophylaxis for the prevention of perinatal HBV infection. Administration of appropriate immunoprophylaxis is approximately 90% effective in preventing HBV infection among children born to HBsAg-positive mothers. In 1995, the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of Northern California (KP)--a health-maintenance organization (HMO) providing care to 2.5 million members and delivering 30,000 infants annually--implemented HBsAg screening of all pregnant women. After initiating the program, KP estimated that at least 25% of the infants born to HBsAg-positive women were not receiving appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis. In response, KP implemented a tracking and follow-up program in 1988. This report describes an assessment of the impact of this program, which indicates that a centralized case-management and tracking system can substantially improve levels of post-exposure prophylaxis."

Prophylactic nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) are recommended for patients with breast cancer who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive before chemotherapy. We performed an up-to-date meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of prophylactic lamivudine use with nonprophylaxis in HBsAg-positive breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. PubMed, the Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were searched for relevant articles until June 2016. Eligible articles comparing the efficacy of prophylactic lamivudine use with nonprophylaxis in HBsAg-positive breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy were identified. Eight studies which had enrolled 709 HBsAg-positive breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy were analysed. Lamivudine prophylaxis significantly reduced the rates of chemotherapy-associated hepatitis B flares in chronic hepatitis B in breast cancer compared with patients with nonprophylaxis (odds ratio [OR]=0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07-0.35, P<.00001). Chemotherapy disruption rates attributed to HBV reactivation in the prophylaxis groups were significantly lower than the nonprophylaxis groups (OR=0.17, 95% CI: 0.07-0.43, P=.0002). Patients with lamivudine prophylaxis had a higher risk for tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) motif mutations than patients with nonprophylaxis (OR=6.33, 95% CI: 1.01-39.60, P=.05). Prophylactic antiviral therapy management is necessary for HBsAg-positive breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, in spite of high correlation with lamivudine-resistant HBV variants with YMDD motif mutations."
5517,0.002,2.0,"Substantial progress has been made in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B during the past decade. Nucleos(t)ide analogues are now widely used due to their convenience, less side effects, and considerable response rates. However, development of antiviral resistance is a major problem being considered as the most important factor for the treatment failure. Viral breakthrough associated with selection of antiviral-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) is usually followed by biochemical breakthrough, clinical deterioration, and even progressive liver failure. Therefore, appropriate management of antiviral resistance is critical for improving treatment outcomes. Strategies for the management of antiviral-resistant chronic HBV infection are described herein considering recently published guidelines. Lamivudine/telbivudine resistance can be managed by adding adefovir. Switching to adefovir or entecavir is also a viable option. However, careful follow-up of viral load is mandatory to detect any primary or secondary treatment failure in case of sequential monotherapy. Interferon or peg-interferon therapy can also be considered in case of young patients with compensated liver disease. For adefovir resistance, lamivudine can be added, but adding or switching to entecavir is a more reasonable option. Likewise, adding or switching to adefovir can be considered for entecavir resistance. Adding or switching to tenofovir needs to be considered upon availability. Experiences for clevudine resistance are still lacking, and need to be studied further upon the isolation of clinically resistant strains. To avoid emergence of resistant mutations, antiviral therapy should be initiated after careful balance of risk and benefit, and the most potent antiviral agent with the lowest resistance rate should be selected."

Herein, we performed the first testing of MIV-150-carrageenan against rectal infection. Rhesus macaques were treated rectally with MIV-150-carrageenan or methyl cellulose (MC) placebo gel up to 4 h prior to rectal challenge with 10³ or 10(4) 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID₅₀) of SHIV-RT. Infection was assessed by measuring plasma virus RNA as well as T and B cell responses. MIV-150-carrageenan protected all animals challenged with 10³ TCID(₅₀ when gel was applied either 30 min or 4 h prior to challenge, while 100% of the MC-treated animals became infected (n = 4 each; P < 0.03). Partial protection (2 of 4 animals) by MIV-150-carrageenan was observed for rectal challenge with 10-fold more virus applied 4 h after the gel. Sequencing of the RT gene from plasma virus RNA isolated at peak viremia confirmed that both of these animals (like infected MC controls) were infected with wild-type virus. Infection correlated with the development of SIV-specific T and B cell responses. MIV-150 was detected in the rectal fluids and tissues 4 h after gel application but was not detected in the blood at any time (0.5 to 24 h). These data are promising for the development of NNRTI-containing gels to prevent rectal HIV transmission."

Recently, several methods have used either high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with radioimmunoassay to obtain in vivo measurements of ZDV-TP. The limit of detection (LOD) by these methods ranged from 20 to 200 fmol/10(6) cells. In this report, we describe the development of a method to determine intracellular ZDV-TP concentrations in HIV-infected patients using SPE and HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry for analysis. The LOD by this method is 4.0 fmol/10(6) cells with a linear concentration range of at least 4 orders of magnitude from 4. 0 to 10,000 fmol/10(6) cells. In hispanic HIV-infected patients, ZDV-TP was detectable even when the sampling time after drug administration was 15 h. Intracellular ZDV-TP concentrations in these patients ranged from 41 to 193 fmol/10(6) cells. The low LOD obtained with this method will provide the opportunity for further in vivo pharmacokinetic studies of intracellular ZDV-TP in different HIV-infected populations. Furthermore, this methodology could be used to perform simultaneous detection of two or more NRTIs, such as ZDV-TP and lamivudine triphosphate."

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of antiretroviral drug resistance in Thai HIV-1 treated individuals after completing the NAPHA program."
3496,0.002,2.0,"The pathogenesis of neurological dysfunction associated with human immunodeficiency (HIV)-1 infection is uncertain. However, the presence of macrophage infiltrates in the central nervous system is a key feature of HIV encephalitis and is correlated with HIV-associated dementia. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that HIV-infected monocyte/macrophages can produce toxic substances that may play a critical role in the development of HIV-associated dementia. However, the exact mechanisms responsible for HIV infection and leukocyte recruitment to the central nervous system remain speculative. Similar to HIV-infected patients, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaque monkeys develop immunosuppression and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related inflammatory disorders, including AIDS encephalitis. In this study, we demonstrate that encephalitic brain from SIV-infected animals has elevated immunohistochemical expression of the C-C chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha and -beta, RANTES, and monocyte chemotactic protein-3, and the C-X-C chemokine interferon-inducible protein-10. These findings suggest that one or all of of these chemokines could be involved in leukocyte recruitment to the brain in SIV-infected macaque monkeys."

5880,0.002,2.0,"The aim of this study was to examine the relationships among diarrhea, CD4+ cell counts and opportunistic protozoa in HIV-infected patients in North India. In a retrospective study, blood and stool samples of 200 HIV-infected patients from March 2001 until 2003, submitted to the AIDS division of National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), were analyzed. Each patient was examined for opportunistic protozoa, HIV-1 status and CD4+ cell counts, and screened for diarrheal symptoms. The rate of diarrhea was 38% in the stool examination. In HIV-infected patients in the groups CD4+ > 500 cells/microL, 200 cells/microL < CD4+ < 500 cells/muL and in the AIDS patients CD4+ < 200 cells/microL, diarrhea was 14.7, 29.8 and 56.1%, respectively. It is clear that the diarrhea in the AIDS patients was significant compared with the two former groups (P < 0.0005). In the AIDS patients CD4+ < 200 cells/microL with diarrhea, Cryptosporidium infection was, at 56.5%, the highest and statistically significant compared with the other parasites (P = 0.037). Microsporidium was detected in 30.4% of the AIDS patients. Diarrhea was common and most strongly associated in patients with low CD4+ cell counts. The data stress the importance of opportunistic protozoa in the HIV-infected patients, and that opportunistic protozoa should be expected in HIV-infected patients with low CD4+ and diarrhea."
3665,0.002,2.0,"Taiwan has been facing a rising epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection since 2004. Injection drug users comprised 38.5% of accumulated HIV cases by 2007. This cross-sectional study investigated the seroprevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), and HIV infection in 753 male substance users who were detained in a detoxification center in Taoyuan, Taiwan. The subjects were enrolled into the study consecutively between February and October, 2005. The seroprevalence rates of HIV antibodies, HCV antibodies, and HBV surface antigens among all subjects, and HDV antibodies among HBV carriers were 6.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.19-8.95), 30.5% (95% CI: 27.23-33.93), 16.9% (95% CI: 14.24-19.71) and 13.7% (95% CI: 8.19-21.04), respectively. Subjects in the heroin injection group had significantly higher rates of HIV infection, HCV infection and HDV superinfection (25.5%, 89.6%, and 38.7%) than those in the heroin non-injection group (0.9%, 24.5%, and 6.25%), the methamphetamine group (0.3%, 8.1%, and 6.7%), and the club drug group (1%, 3%, and 0%; P < 0.001). The odds of HCV, HIV, or HDV infection were 74.7, 63.8, and 11.1 higher, respectively, for heroin injection drug users than for non-injection drug users (P < 0.0001). Compared to HIV-negative individuals, the odds of being a heroin injector and the odds of HCV co-infections were 64-fold and 149-fold higher, respectively, in HIV-positive individuals. The impact of HBV, HCV, and HDV infection on the HIV epidemic in Taiwan should be monitored closely."
7350,0.002,2.0,"This study evaluated the prevalence of hepatitis Delta virus (HDV) infections in various groups of HBsAg carriers including drug addicts and patients with hemophilia in the Federal Republic of Germany. HDV was found only occasionally (less than 1%) in individuals found HBsAg positive during an examination as potential blood donors or in hemodialysis patients, but in 3% in patients with chronic hepatitis and up to 50% in drug addicts and hemophilia patients. These findings are in agreement with data reported from other European countries. Presence of antibodies to HDV in two hemodialysis patients indicates the presence of HDV in this group and screening for HDV infections in hemodialysis units is indicated to prevent outbreaks of this disease in HBsAg-positive patients with possibly serious consequences."
8387,0.002,2.0,"Parenteral drug abusers are the second largest group at risk for developing AIDS (25% of US cases) and a major risk group for infection with both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the HBV-dependent RNA hepatitis delta virus (HDV). This study was conducted to determine the prevalence in 1984-1985 and relationships of HDV and HBV infections in 372 unselected parenteral drug abusers without AIDS or symptoms related to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection (but 49% of whom were positive for HIV-1 antibodies) and in 53 drug abusers hospitalized with AIDS. The prevalence of HDV markers in the combined study groups was 20%; 81% of study subjects with hepatitis B surface antigenemia (HBsAg) had one marker for HDV infection. Significant differences were found between patients with and without AIDS with respect to the prevalence of hepatitis delta antigen (5.7% vs. 0.8%, P less than .05) and antibody (0 vs. 21.4%, P less than .01) and HBsAg (15.1% vs. 5.1%, P less than .05). The significantly higher prevalence of hepatitis delta antigen and HBsAg in subjects with AIDS suggests that persistence or reactivation of these viruses is significantly greater among parenteral drug abusers with AIDS than among those without AIDS. These findings, along with the absence of hepatitis delta antibodies in the drug abusers with AIDS, are probably related to the profound general immunosuppression that occurs in AIDS."
94,0.002,2.0,"Hemodialysed patients are recognised as a group at increased risk of infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and incidence of HCV infection among dialysis patients of the east-centre part of Tunisia. Two hundred and seventy-six patients dialysed until 2001 were recruited within seven hemodialysis units located in the cities of Sousse, Monastir and Mahdia. The serum markers of HCV infection were tested over the period of March 2000-December 2002, by a 3rd generation ELISA test for antibodies and by qualitative RT-PCR technique for viral RNA. The prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies and of HCV RNA was 32.6% (90 patients) and 25.7% (71 patients), respectively. Between 1998 and 2002, 20 new infections were documented in five of the seven dialysis units corresponding to an incidence of 2.34% per year, with an average time of contamination after the beginning of dialysis of 4.6 years. If all the infections are assessed to have occurred during dialysis, the density of incidence of HCV contamination was 4.4% per year of dialysis. A high correlation was noticed between the presence of HCV markers in serum and the duration of dialysis (F = 34.15, P < 0.0001). In the absence of other risk factors (transfusion, drug-addiction), these results plead for the nosocomial transmission of the observed HCV infections. A phylogenetic analysis of the E2 hypervariable region of the viral genome is in progress to confirm this assumption."
993,0.002,2.0,"Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is more common than that with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), although more attention has been given to HCV coinfection as a result of its higher frequency of chronic disease. Natural history studies with HIV-HCV coinfection have also shown more rapid progression of liver disease, and end-stage liver disease due to hepatitis C is now a leading cause of death in HIV-infected patients. Like HCV infection, HBV infection can also be associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV infection. Fortunately, treatment options of hepatitis B are expanding and may have a clinical impact on slowing disease progression. A case study of a patient with severe HBV-HIV coinfection is presented to illustrate what is known about this increasingly problematic disease state."
9144,0.002,2.0,"HIV-1 infection is often complicated by the dysfunction of central nervous system (CNS). Degenerative neuronal changes as well as neuronal loss have been documented in individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) causes similar CNS manifestation and FIV infected cats provide an animal model for human immunodeficiency virus infection in humans. In this study, we examined the brain of FIV-infected cats and controls with immunohistochemical techniques using antibodies to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). We found a significant decrease in expression of MAP-2 and GAD in neurons of infected animals compared to controls. In contrast, the expression of neurofilaments and glial fibrillary acidic protein was rather increased. The changes observed in the brain were similar to those seen in humans undergoing the normal aging process as well as those suffering from neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease and other dementing disorders. These changes in the feline brain give insight into the deleterious effects of FIV on the CNS."
4454,0.002,2.0,"Liver fibrosis is common, particularly in individuals who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV-infected individuals have excess congestive heart failure (CHF) risk compared with uninfected people. It remains unknown whether liver fibrosis stage influences the CHF risk or if HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection modifies this association. Our objectives were to assess whether 1) stage of liver fibrosis is independently associated with incident CHF and 2) the association between stage of liver fibrosis and incident CHF is modified by HIV/HCV status. Participants alive on or after April 1, 2003, in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study were included. Those without prevalent cardiovascular disease were followed until their first CHF event, death, last follow-up date, or December 31, 2011. Liver fibrosis was measured using the fibrosis 4 index (FIB-4), which is calculated using age, aminotransferases, and platelets. Cox proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for cardiovascular disease risk factors. Among 96,373 participants over 6.9 years, 3844 incident CHF events occurred. FIB-4 between 1.45 and 3.25 (moderate fibrosis) and FIB-4 > 3.25 (advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis) were associated with CHF (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.17 [1.07-1.27] and 1.65 [1.43-1.92], respectively). The association of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis and incident CHF persisted regardless of HIV/HCV status."
10007,0.002,2.0,"The beneficial effects of Bifidobacteria on health have been widely accepted. Patients with chronic liver disease have varying degrees of intestinal microflora imbalance with a decrease of total Bifidobacterial counts. Since different properties have been attributed to different Bifidobacterium species and there is no information available for the detailed changes in the genus Bifidobacterium in patients with chronic liver disease heretofore, it is meaningful to investigate the structure of this bacterium at the species level in these patients. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition of intestinal Bifidobacterium in patients with hepatitis B virus-induced chronic liver disease. Nested-PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), clone library, and real-time quantitative PCR were performed on the fecal samples of 16 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB patients), 16 patients with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis (HBV cirrhotics), and 15 healthy subjects (Controls). Though there was no significant difference in the diversity among the three groups (P = 0.196), Bifidobacterium dentium seems to be specifically enhanced in patients as the PCR-DGGE profiles showed, which was further validated by clone library and real-time quantitative PCR. In contrast to the B. dentium, Bifidobacterium                         catenulatum/Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum were detected less frequently in the predominant profile and by quantitative PCR in HBV cirrhotics than in the controls, and the level of this species was also significantly different between these two groups (P = 0.023). Although having no quantitative difference among the three groups, Bifidobacterium longum was less commonly detected in HBV cirrhotics than in CHB patients and Controls by quantitative PCR (P = 0.011). Thus, the composition of intestinal Bifidobacterium was deeply altered in CHB and HBV cirrhotic patients with a shift from beneficial species to opportunistic pathogens. The results provide further insights into the dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota in patients with hepatitis B virus-induced chronic liver disease and might potentially serve as guidance for the probiotics interventions of these diseases."
4703,0.002,2.0,"Injection drug use is a common route of infection for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the UK. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence and force of infection for HBV among injecting drug users (IDUs) recruited from multiple community and drug agency settings in England and Wales between 1990 and 2004. Cross-sectional studies of IDUs in and out of contact with drug agencies were conducted throughout the 15-year period. Oral fluid samples were tested for antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between risk factors and anti-HBc positivity and force of infection models were explored. In total, 2527 injectors were recruited from community settings, and 29 386 from drug agencies. Anti-HBc prevalence was 31% (95% CI 30.7-31.8%). It declined in the early 1990s from around 50% in 1992 to 25% in 1999, after which it increased slightly. It was also higher in those who had injected for longer, older IDUs, those recruited in London and North West England, and those reporting having a previous voluntary confidential HIV test. The force of infection models suggested that the incidence of infection increased in 1999-2004 compared with 1993-1998, and was higher in new injectors compared with those injecting for > or =1 year. In conclusion, findings suggest ongoing HBV transmission in recent years despite an overall decline in prevalence in the early and mid-1990s, and highlight the importance of targeting vaccination programmes at new IDUs who have high incidence rates of infection."
4213,0.002,2.0,"According to World Health Organization (WHO)/Joint United Nations Programme on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (UNAIDS) Report in 2007, 33.2 million people are living with HIV, 2.5 million ones have been newly infected with HIV, and 2.1 million ones died from AIDS, including 330,000 children. Therefore, HIV/AIDS still remains a public health emergency and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. It is believed that reverse transcriptase (RT) is a crucial enzyme in the life cycle of HIV-1, and thereby RT has been the important drug target for antiretroviral (ARV) chemotherapy against AIDS. To our knowledge, dipyridodiazepinone analogs have been considered as one class of potential non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), especially the structurally and chemically related nevirapine (Viramune(R)), which was the first NNRTI approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection for adults in 1996 and for children in 1998. This review mainly highlights the progress of synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) of dipyridodiazepinone analogs; in the meantime, the mechanism of action is also presented. It will pave the way for the design and development of novel dipyridodiazepinone analogs as NNRTIs in AIDS chemotherapy in the future."

3085,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major public health concern worldwide with 240 million individuals chronically infected and at risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current treatments rarely cure chronic hepatitis B infection, highlighting the need for new anti-HBV drugs. Nucleic acid polymers (NAPs) are phosphorothioated oligonucleotides that have demonstrated a great potential to inhibit infection with several viruses. In chronically infected human patients, NAPs administration lead to a decline of blood HBsAg and HBV DNA and to HBsAg seroconversion, the expected signs of functional cure. NAPs have also been shown to prevent infection of duck hepatocytes with the Avihepadnavirus duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and to exert an antiviral activity against established DHBV infection in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we investigated the specific anti-HBV antiviral activity of NAPs in the HepaRG human hepatoma cell line and primary cultures of human hepatocytes. NAPs with different chemical features (phosphorothioation, 2'O-methyl ribose, 5-methylcytidine) were assessed for antiviral activity when provided at the time of HBV inoculation or post-inoculation. NAPs dose-dependently inhibited HBV entry in a phosphorothioation-dependent, sequence-independent and size-dependent manner. This inhibition of HBV entry by NAPs was impaired by 2'O-methyl ribose modification. NAP treatment after viral inoculation did not elicit any antiviral activity."

In a multicenter observational cohort study of 325 HIV-infected children born during 1986-1997, clinical progression was compared among infected children exposed or unexposed to Zdv during prenatal and perinatal periods. Zdv exposure was associated with 1.8-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.02-3.11) increased risk of progressing to AIDS or death after adjusting for year of birth, maternal CD4 cell count, maternal AIDS diagnosis, and subsequent antiretroviral therapy of the child. Mean log(10) viral copies at 7-12 weeks were higher among Zdv-exposed children (P=.004). No infected child treated early with multidrug therapy progressed to AIDS or died by 1 year, regardless of early Zdv exposure.

We analyzed data from the N2R study which was an open label, randomized, comparative trial comparing treatment outcomes between 71 TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients receiving efavirenz (EFV)-based and nevirapine (NVP)-based ART; all of whom were receiving RMP-containing anti-TB treatment. Demographic data, liver function test, CD4 cell count, plasma HIV-1 RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody were collected before initiating ART (week 0). Liver enzymes and total bilirubin levels were monitored at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after ART initiation. All patients were followed until TB therapy was completed. Of 142 patients, 8 patients were excluded. Among the remaining 134 patients, the mean+/-SD age was 36.8+/-8.6 years and 67.2% were male. Severe hepatotoxicity (grade 3 or 4) developed in 4 patients (2.9%); 3 patients (4.6%) in the NVP group and 1 patient (1.4%) in the EFV group. Severe hyperbilirubinemia (grade 3 or 4) occurred in 7 patients (5.2%); 5 patients (7.7%) in the NVP group and 2 patients (2.9%) in the EFV group. Grade 1 or 2 hepatotoxicity occurred in 34 patients (31.4%). Hepatitis C virus co-infection (adjusted OR 3.03; 95%CI 1.26-7.29) was an independent risk factor associated with grade 1-4 hepatotoxicity (p=0.013).

9170,0.002,2.0,"Perinatal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission is characterized by acquisition of a homogeneous viral quasispecies, yet the selective factors responsible for this genetic bottleneck are unclear. We examined the role of maternal autologous neutralizing antibody (aNAB) in selective transmission of HIV-1 escape variants to infants. Maternal sera from 38 infected mothers at the time of delivery were assayed for autologous neutralizing antibody activity against maternal time-of-delivery HIV-1 isolates in vitro. Maternal sera were also tested for cross-neutralization of infected-infant-first-positive-time-point viral isolates. Heteroduplex and DNA sequence analyses were then performed to identify the initial infecting virus as a neutralization-sensitive or escape HIV-1 variant. In utero transmitters (n = 14) were significantly less likely to have aNAB to their own HIV-1 strains at delivery than nontransmitting mothers (n = 17, 14.3% versus 76.5%, P = 0.003). Cross-neutralization assays of infected-infant-first-positive-time-point HIV-1 isolates indicated that while 14/21 HIV-1-infected infant first positive time point isolates were resistant to their own mother's aNAB, no infant isolate was inherently resistant to antibody neutralization by all sera tested. Furthermore, both heteroduplex (n = 21) and phylogenetic (n = 9) analyses showed that selective perinatal transmission and/or outgrowth of maternal autologous neutralization escape HIV-1 variants occurs in utero and intrapartum. These data indicate that maternal autologous neutralizing antibody can exert powerful protective and selective effects in perinatal HIV-1 transmission and therefore has important implications for vaccine development."
1208,0.002,2.0,"The high levels of genetic diversity shown by hepatitis B virus (HBV) are commonly attributed to the low fidelity of its polymerase. However, the rate of spontaneous mutation of human HBV in vivo is currently unknown. Here, based on the evolutionary principle that the population frequency of lethal mutations equals the rate at which they are produced, we have estimated the mutation rate of HBV in vivo by scoring premature stop codons in 621 publicly available, full-length, molecular clone sequences derived from patients. This yielded an estimate of 8.7 × 10-5 spontaneous mutations per nucleotide per cell infection in untreated patients, which should be taken as an upper limit estimate because PCR errors and/or lack of effective lethality may inflate observed mutation frequencies. We found that, in patients undergoing lamivudine/adefovir treatment, the HBV mutation rate was elevated by more than sixfold, revealing a mutagenic effect of this treatment. Genome-wide analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms indicated that lamivudine/adefovir treatment increases the fraction of A/T-to-G/C base substitutions, consistent with recent work showing similar effects of lamivudine in cellular DNA. Based on these data, the rate at which HBV produces new genetic variants in treated patients is similar to or even higher than in RNA viruses. "
8130,0.002,2.0,"Direct sequencing of segments of the envelope gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 proviruses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells has revealed that a cohort of hemophiliacs who were infected after exposure to a single common batch of factor VIII share closely related virus strains. Seventy-four sequences extending from hypervariable regions V4 through V5 from nine patients yielded a mean intrapatient nucleotide distance of 5.5%, while a mean of 4.2% was observed in 39 sequences of the V3 loop (six patients). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that sequences of six Edinburgh patients were particularly closely related and those from a patient infected in the United States were very distinct. The mean nucleotide distance among these six was 8.3%, while the mean distance from the U.S.-derived sequences was 25.5% in the V4-V5 region. The rate of sequence change across this patient group has been estimated to be 0.4% per year in the V4-V5 region and 0.5% per year in the V3 region, with at least a twofold range across patients. Only two inactivating nucleotide substitutions have been observed in a total of 42 kb of sequence obtained from the env and gag genes during this study."
389,0.002,2.0,"We assessed the reproducibility of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease sequencing using cryopreserved plasma aliquots obtained from 46 heavily treated HIV-1-infected individuals in two laboratories using dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The rates of complete sequence concordance between the two laboratories were 99.1% for the protease sequence and 99.0% for the RT sequence. Approximately 90% of the discordances were partial, defined as one laboratory detecting a mixture and the second laboratory detecting only one of the mixture's components. Only 0.1% of the nucleotides were completely discordant between the two laboratories, and these were significantly more likely to occur in plasma samples with lower plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. Nucleotide mixtures were detected at approximately 1% of the nucleotide positions, and in every case in which one laboratory detected a mixture, the second laboratory either detected the same mixture or detected one of the mixture's components. The high rate of concordance in detecting mixtures and the fact that most discordances between the two laboratories were partial suggest that most discordances were caused by variation in sampling of the HIV-1 quasispecies by PCR rather than by technical errors in the sequencing process itself."
4511,0.002,2.0,"The evolutionary rate of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) is considered to be very low, in strong contrast to the related human retrovirus HIV. However, current estimates of the HTLV-1 rate rely on the anthropological calibration of phylogenies using assumed dates of human migration events. To obtain an independent rate estimate, we analyzed two variable regions of the HTLV-1 genome (LTR and env) from eight infected families. Remarkable genetic stability was observed, as only two mutations in LTR (756 bp) and three mutations in env (522 bp) occurred within the 16 vertical transmission chains, including one ambiguous position in each region. The evolutionary rate in HTLV-1 was then calculated using a maximum-likelihood approach that used the highest and lowest possible times of HTLV-1 shared ancestry, given the known transmission histories. The rates for the LTR and env regions were 9.58 x 10(-8)-1.25 x 10(-5) and 7.84 x 10(-7) -2.33 x 10(-5)nucleotide substitutions per site per year, respectively. A more precise estimate was obtained for the combined LTR-env data set, which was 7.06 x 10(-7)-1.38 x 10(-5)substitutions per site per year. We also note an interesting correlation between the occurrence of mutations in HTLV-1 and the age of the individual infected."
4171,0.002,2.0,"Bilateral lower motor neuron type facial palsy is an unusual neurological disorder. There are few reports that associate it with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on initial presentation. A 51-year-old married woman, who was previously healthy and had no risk of HIV infection, presented solely with bilateral simultaneous facial palsy. A positive HIV serology test was confirmed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. Following a short course of oral prednisolone, the patient recovered completely from facial palsy in three months, even though an antiretroviral treatment was suspended. Exclusion of HIV infection in patients with bilateral facial palsy is essential for early diagnosis and management of HIV. "
248,0.002,2.0,"The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in the levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF binding proteins (BP) 1, 2, and 3 in HIV-infected adults throughout the course of their disease, and to assess the responsiveness of the IGF system components to growth hormone (GH) administration (6 mg/day) for 2 weeks. Healthy control study subjects (n = 10) were compared with patients who were either HIV-positive (n = 9), had AIDS without weight loss (n = 13), or had AIDS with >10% weight loss (n = 6), all of whom had been free of acute illness for at least 3 months. Under basal conditions, fasting serum concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, glucagon, insulin, IGF-I, and IGFBP-3 were not significantly different among the four groups. The serum concentrations of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 were significantly higher in AIDS patients with wasting than in the other three groups (p < .05). In addition, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the levels of IGFBP- 1 (p = .004) and IGFBP-2 (p = .03) and the stage of disease. Following GH administration, the serum concentrations of insulin and IGF-I were increased in all groups (p < .05). In addition, the increases in insulin levels correlated with stage of disease (p = .004). The responses of the IGFBPs were more variable. GH administration significantly increased the levels of IGFBP-3 in all groups except the patients with AIDS wasting, whereas the levels of IGFBP-1 were significantly decreased in controls and AIDS patients. These results demonstrate that there is a continuum of both elevations in the IGFBPs and altered metabolic responsiveness in patients infected with HIV that increases with the severity of the disease. These data also demonstrate that AIDS patients, who are free from secondary infection, respond to administration of GH by significantly increasing hepatic IGF-I production."

3307,0.002,2.0,"During the last 5 years, considerable scientific and financial efforts have been made in the development of quantitative nucleic acid detection technology. For detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), quantitative culture is time consuming, cumbersome and requires appropriate laboratory safety equipment. Quantitative determination of p24 antigen by enzyme immunoassay is of limited value due to its relatively poor sensitivity. Therefore, quantitative determination of viral load using nucleic acid amplification techniques is the most accurate, prognostic marker for HIV type 1 infection, independently of the CD4+ cell count. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is not cultivable in vitro. Serological assays allow an accurate diagnosis and follow-up of acute or chronic infection. Quantification of HBV DNA is used for the monitoring of antiviral therapy, determination of infectivity and for resolution of unclear serological profiles, e.g. isolated anti-HBc reactivity, as well as for patients in which HBV mutants are suspected. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can only be detected by molecular based assays because no cell culture system, which permits a reliable isolation of clinical specimens, is currently available. Furthermore, early diagnosis and follow-up of infection cannot be achieved with antibody serology. The prognostic relevance of quantitative HCV RNA determination is of limited value for the long-term prognosis of chronic hepatitis C. However, viral load may predict the outcome of antiviral therapy. Genetic diversity is another challenge for HCV RNA quantification."
3936,0.002,2.0,"Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection is common in Egypt and other developing countries. Patients coinfected with HCV and schistosomiasis exhibit a unique clinical, virological and histological pattern manifested by viral persistence with high HCV RNA titers as well as higher necroinflammatory and fibrosis scores in their liver biopsy samples. Dual infections of schistosomiasis and viral infections display significant influences on host immune reactions including cytokine shift pattern alteration, cytotoxic T lymphocyte response and other impaired immunologic functions with diminished capacity to clear the virus. We investigated the cytokine pattern against HCV and S. mansoni antigens in patients coinfected with HCV and S. mansoni and compared them with responses in patients infected with HCV or S. mansoni alone. This study included 4 groups; (Gr I) included 20 patients infected with chronic HCV, their sera were reactive for anti-HCV antibodies, samples were verified for RNA detection to identify those who have viremia. (Gr II) included 15 patients infected with schistosomiasis alone, they were subjected to detection of S. mansoni ova in stool, rectal snip or serological test. (Gr III) included 20 patients with chronic HCV and schistosomiasis coinfection, which were diagnosed by the above-mentioned criteria. (Gr IV) included 15 healthy individuals, who were matched for age and sex and have no evidence of liver diseases served as control subjects. The results showed that a highly significant increase in serum IFN-gamma and IL-18 levels in patients infected with HCV alone compared with the other patient groups and control. On the other hand, a highly significant increase was found in serum IL-4 and IL-10 levels in coinfected patients and patients with schistosomiasis alone compared with the control but a significant increase was found in the two groups compared with HCV patients. A significant increase in serum IL-4 and IL-10 were also found in HCV patients compared with the control. In conclusions, our data showed that coinfected patients have dominant Th2 cytokine profile induced by S. mansoni and this Th2 antagonized and down-regulated the antiviral activities of Th1 cytokine profile in HCV infection that probably acquired after S. mansoni infection resulting in failing to mount significant HCV specific Th1 response and thereby fail to clear the virus in coinfected, compared with patients infected with HCV or schistosomiasis alone."

7376,0.002,2.0,"Patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection develop an immunologic thrombocytopenic purpura associated with markedly elevated platelet IgG, IgM, and C3C4 as well as serum immune complexes determined by the polyethylene glycol (PEG) method. Analysis of their serum PEG-precipitable immune complexes as well as platelet acid eluates revealed the presence of anti-HIV-1 antibody existing as a complex that eluted in the void volume of a Sephadex G-200 gel-filtration column. The complex binds to washed normal platelets, whereas affinity-purified anti-HIV-1 (gp120) antibody does not. HIV-1 antigen or proviral DNA was not detectable in the immune complexes or platelet extracts. However, anti-antibodies directed against anti-HIV-1 antibody were detectable in the immune complexes as well as platelet eluates. Approximately 50% of eluted platelet IgG contained anti-HIV-1 antibody. Thus the markedly elevated platelet immunoglobulin is partly due to the presence of anti-HIV-1 antibody complexes. This may be responsible for the enhanced platelet clearance and thrombocytopenia in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related immunologic thrombocytopenia."
3239,0.002,2.0,"HIV-1 RNA levels in semen and blood compartments decrease below detection limits during highly active antiretroviral therapy. Despite these therapeutic effects, it is clear that persistent, latent HIV-1 reservoirs are capable of rebounding in the absence of drug treatment or by evolution of escape mutants remain. The current study was designed to examine the presence of latent virus in semen and blood compartments and its evolution following potent combination therapy with indinavir (protease inhibitor) and efavirenz [nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor]. Using an ultrasensitive in situ hybridization assay HIV-1 mRNA was detected in cultured seminal and blood mononuclear cells in all patients up to 1789 days posttherapy. Higher levels of HIV-1 mRNA were consistently detected in seminal mononuclear cells as compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in all time points analyzed posttherapy. Analysis of viral RNA from cultured PBMC before and after therapy displayed no evidence of therapy-induced drug resistance in the viral polymerase gene in the majority of patients. However, distinct envelope populations were detected in these viral RNA populations following therapy, indicating possible selection of quasispecies. The observed ongoing replication and evolution in the PBMC viral envelope sequences likely occurred in the seminal compartment HIV populations, given that the seminal cells showed the ability to express HIV-1 mRNA following cultivation. This together with our previous studies (Gupta P, et al.: J Infect Dis 2000;182:79-87) suggest that the genital and blood compartments likely serve as distinct reservoirs harboring latent HIV-1 during prolonged drug therapy."

4715,0.002,2.0,"Costs of medications for ambulatory HIV-infected people increase as knowledge of antiretroviral therapy and therapy for opportunistic infection grows. We evaluated the evolution of drug costs for HIV-infected persons who attend a university clinic in Baltimore, Maryland. Cross-sectional abstracts of a cohort of patients for four periods, corresponding to landmark changes in therapy, who attended the clinic between June 1995 and September 1996 were obtained. Monthly medication costs for all patients were calculated. Mean costs increased significantly (p < .01) from period 1 ($447 U.S.) to period 4 ($1048 U.S.). Multivariate analysis only revealed higher costs for patients with a CD4+ count <200 cells/mm3 (p < .001). The proportion of costs attributable to antiretroviral therapy increased from 34% in period 1 to 53% in period 4. Combination therapy increased >10-fold, from 8% in period 1 to 94% in period 4. Protease inhibitor use also increased significantly, from 4% in period 2 to 53% in period 4. We quantified the increase in costs of medications from mid-1995 to late 1996. Increases in costs appear to be the result of increasing complexity of drug regimens, particularly antiretroviral therapy in combinations."

138,0.002,2.0,"Microsporidia are increasingly being recognised as important enteric pathogens in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, i.e. acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The aims of this study were to investigate the frequency of detection of microsporidia associated with diarrhoea in patients with advanced HIV disease in the north west of England, and to determine the species involved and their prevalence. During the period from April 1992 to the end of December 1995, chronic diarrhoea in 88 patients in the late stage of HIV disease was investigated. Duodenal biopsies, duodenal aspirates or jejunal biopsies were received from 38 patients, and stool samples from 63 patients, as part of the routine investigation of possible causes of diarrhoea in these patients. Biopsies and aspirates were examined by thin-section electron microscopy (EM), and stool samples were examined by epi-fluorescence microscopy after staining with Calcofluor. Putative stool positives were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. CD4-lymphocyte counts were available from all patients who provided samples. Nine out of 63 patients (14.3%) were found to be excreting microsporidial spores on stool examination. The species was confirmed as Enterocytozoon bieneusi. The mean CD4-lymphocyte count for this group was 37 x 10(6)/L (normal range 517-1677 x 10(6)/L). Three out of 38 biopsy specimens (7.9%) were also found to be infected with this microsporidian. The mean CD4-lymphocyte count for this group was 72 x 10(6)/L. Encephalitozoon intestinalis was not found in any samples examined. The prevalence of microsporidial infection in AIDS patients in the north west of England appears to be similar to that of patients in London, but less than that reported in studies from other developed countries."
4235,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry into target cells is a multistep process initiated by envelope protein gp120 binding to cell surface CD4. The conformational changes induced by this interaction likely favor a second-step interaction between gp120 and a coreceptor such as CXCR4 or CCR5. Here, we report a spontaneous and stable CD4-independent entry phenotype for the HIV-1 NDK isolate. This mutant strain, which emerged from a population of chronically infected CD4-positive CEM cells, can replicate in CD4-negative human cell lines. The presence of CXCR4 alone renders cells susceptible to infection by the mutant NDK, and infection can be blocked by the CXCR4 natural ligand SDF-1. Furthermore, we have correlated the CD4-independent phenotype with seven mutations in the C2 and C3 regions and the V3 loop. We propose that the mutant gp120 spontaneously acquires a conformation allowing it to interact directly with CXCR4. This virus provides us with a powerful tool to study directly gp120-CXCR4 interactions."
901,0.002,2.0,"The hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection plays a major role in severe liver damage caused by hepatitis. To establish the prevalence of HDV infection in haemophilic patients and patients without haemophilia, 87 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were examined for serological evidence of delta hepatitis. In addition HBV, HDV and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection markers were compared to clinical and histopathological outcome of hepatitis. Out of 46 haemophiliacs 30 (65%) were anti-HD-seropositive; 10 out of 30 anti-HD-positive patients (33%) had pathological liver function tests compared to 2 out of 16 anti-HD-negative haemophiliacs (13%). The rate of HIV infection did not differ between the HDV infected and the non-HDV infected individuals with haemophilia (17/27 anti-HD-positive patients versus 12/16 anti-HD-negative patients). Two haemophilic anti-HD-positive patients underwent liver biopsy, in both cases hepatitis D antigen (HDAg) was detected in the biopsies. Only 2 out of 41 patients without haemophilia were anti-HD-positive. Both had pathological liver function tests; chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis, respectively, were diagnosed and HDAg was found in the liver biopsies. Out of 39 anti-HD-seronegative patients without haemophilia, 26 (67%) were hepatitis B e antigen positive; in the sera of 20 patients (51%) HBV-DNA was demonstrated, but only 6 patients (15%) had pathological liver function tests. In conclusion a high seroprevalence of HDV infection was found in haemophilic patients treated with non-pasteurized commercial clotting factor concentrates. An endemic spreading of HDV infection in patients without haemophilia with chronic HBV infection could not be detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

1891,0.002,2.0,"The human placenta is relatively resistant to Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), but obstetric complications associated with inflammatory processes, including chorioamnionitis and spontaneous preterm delivery, are associated with increased rates of vertical transmission. It was hypothesized that the pro-inflammatory mediator tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), which promotes HIV-1 transmission across endothelial membranes, increases HIV-1 transmission across the placenta. Flow cytometry and immunostaining studies were performed, which demonstrated that the HIV-1 receptors CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 were not expressed by villous trophoblast cells. Consequently, primary villous trophoblast cells were not infected with cell-free HIV-1 isolates, as measured by in situ PCR and quantitative PCR, but villous trophoblast cells were infected by HIV-1-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). HIV-1 from infected PBMC was rapidly transported across confluent transformed trophoblast cell monolayers by transcytosis, and TNF-alpha significantly upregulated transcytosis of HIV-1 across the trophoblast layer without disrupting cell viability or confluency. Inhibitors of TNF-alpha (antibodies against TNF-alpha and TNF-alpha receptors) and an anti-inflammatory drug (tenidap) significantly reduced transcytosis rates. It was concluded that the villous trophoblast is resistant to infection by cell-free HIV-1 but susceptible to transcytosis of HIV-1 from infected PBMC, and inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha may play a critical role in promoting maternal-fetal transmission of HIV-1."

The four methods, the Antibody Only, Indirect, Direct, and Virologic Methods, yielded transmission rate estimates of 19-25%, classifying 59-89% of the cohort. Estimation based on persistence of HIV-1 antibody and clinical assessment yielded transmission rates similar to those methods that incorporated virologic testing."

2189,0.002,2.0,"We performed a cross-sectional and partly retrospective virological evaluation of 31 long-term responders (LTRs) to zidovudine (ZDV) (persistent increase in the CD4+ cell counts without progression of HIV infection throughout a period of ZDV therapy > 3 years) and 17 well-matched controls who developed a marked immunological deterioration over a 24-month period of ZDV therapy. The biological phenotype of HIV-1 was assessed by testing the capacity of the isolates to replicate in the MT-2, HUT-78, C-8166, and U-937 T cell lines, and mutations at codons 215 and 41 of RT were checked in proviral DNA from uncultured PBMCs. Show/low non-syncytium-inducing (S/L-NSI) and rapid/high syncytium-inducing (R/H-SI) variants were detected in 25 (81%) and 2 (6%) LTRs, respectively. HIV-1 could not be isolated in the remaining four LTRs (13%). Conversely, 12 of 17 (71%) controls yielded R/H-SI variants. Conversion from the S/L-NSI to R/H to R/H-SI phenotype occurred in 5 controls but in none of the 18 LTRs tested. Mutant sequences in proviral DNA from control PBMCs were consistently detected (94%), while a wild-type sequence of the residues investigated was found in the majority of LTRs (77%). In our series, patients who received immunological and clinical benefits even after prolonged ZDV treatment had S/L-NSI viruses and a low risk to develop ZDV resistance. Conversely, subjects who demonstrated an immunological and clinical deterioration yielded R/H-SI variants or shifted from S/L-NSI to R/H-SI phenotypes and were at higher risk to develop mutations indicating ZDV resistance."

The patient developed severe hepatitis after chemotherapy and, despite achieving complete remission of the malignancy, died of hepatic failure. We carried out a retrospective study of changes in the serological markers of HBV in this patient. Both serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) were negative on admission. During the course of chemotherapy, HBsAg gradually became positive, but no liver dysfunction was apparent until after completion of the chemotherapy. The patient showed no initial evidence of being a latent HBV carrier. Therefore, we believe that screening for HBsAg is insufficient for detecting latent HBV carriers, and that investigation for hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) is essential."
7050,0.002,2.0,"Impaired hepatitis B virus vaccine (HBVV) efficacy has been observed in HIV-infected patients. We assessed the immunogenicity of double-dose (DD) hepatitis B virus revaccination in patients who had failed to respond to standard vaccination. A retrospective chart review of 4,663 patients ensued in two urban HIV clinics between January 2004 and March 2009. Of 363 patients who received three standard doses (SDs) of HBVV, 126 (34.7%) responded with detectable hepatitis B surface antibody [(HBsAb) HBsAb titer of > or =10 mIU/ml] and 237 (65.3%) nonresponders (NRs) remained seronegative. Among NRs, 61 received three to eight additional SDs of HBVV; 29 received three double doses (DDs) of HBVV (40 microg/dose), spaced at monthly dosing intervals; and 11 received from one to five additional SD HBVV (who remained seronegative) and then received three DDs HBVV. Response rate was significantly higher among the 40 DD recipients than among the 61 who received only additional SD (34/40, 85%, vs. 36/61, 59%; p = 0.006). In the revaccinated NR group (61 SD + 40 DD), a logistic regression analysis found that use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (OR, 10.166; CI, 1.359-76.026; p = 0.024), and CD4 cell counts > or =200 cells/mm(3) at the time of revaccination (OR, 9.233; CI, 1.393-61.207; p = 0.021) were associated with HBsAb response, as was DD HBV revaccination (OR, 4.177; CI, 1.282-13.614; p = 0.018). Rescue DD hepatitis B vaccination appears to improve the HBsAb response rate significantly in HIV-infected NR patients, especially after an adequate immune restoration with HAART. More prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings."
7141,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated cognitive impairment, a significant cause of morbidity, affects up to 30% of HIV-infected people. Its prevalence doubled as patients began to live longer after the introduction of highly active retroviral therapy. Women are now one of the fastest growing groups with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States and Puerto Rico, but relatively little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of cognitive dysfunction in HIV-infected women. In this study the authors investigated its prevalence in a group of HIV-1-seropositive Hispanic women in Puerto Rico. Forty-nine women with a nadir CD4 cell count of < or = 500 cells/mm3 were enrolled. Cognitive impairment was defined according to the American Academy of Neurology criteria for HIV dementia as modified to identify an ""asymptomatic cognitively impaired"" group. Observed prevalence was compared with prevalence in other populations in United States, Europe, and Australia. Differences in clinical markers and neuropsychological test performance among the cohort stratified by cognitive impairment were tested. Cognitive impairment was observed in 77.6% (38/49) of cases; asymptomatic cognitive impairment in 32.7% (16/49); minor cognitive motor disorders in 16.3% (8/49); and HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in 28.6% (14/49). Cognitive impairment did not correlate with age, CD4 cell count, viral load, or treatment modality. The cross-sectional prevalence of HIV-associated cognitive impairment was 77.6% (28.6% for HAD). These findings should enhance awareness of the prevalence of HIV-associated cognitive impairment, both clinically apparent and ""asymptomatic,"" in Hispanic women and lead to improvements in areas such as education and compliance and to reevaluation of treatment interventions."
8725,0.002,2.0,"We wanted to establish an in vitro human model for AIDS-associated dementia and pursue the hypothesis that this disease process may be a result of soluble factors produced by HIV-infected macrophages. Human brain aggregates were prepared from nine different brain specimens, and were treated with supernatants from in vitro HIV-infected macrophages (SI), uninfected macrophages (SU), infected T cells, or macrophage-conditioned media from four AIDS patients. Seven of nine treated brains exposed to SI showed peripheral rarefaction after 1 wk of incubation that by ultrastructural analysis showed cytoplasmic vacuolation. Aggregates from two of three brain cultures treated with SI for 3 wk became smaller, an approximately 50% decrease in size. The degree of apparent toxicity in brains exposed to patient-derived macrophage supernatants paralleled the proportion of macrophages found to be expressing HIV p24. Ultrastructural abnormalities were not observed in brains treated with supernatants from HIV-infected T cells, uninfected macrophages, or LPS-activated macrophages. Levels of five neurotransmitter amino acids were decreased in comparison to the structural amino acid leucine. These findings suggest that HIV-infected macrophages, infected both in vitro as well as derived from AIDS patients' peripheral blood, produce factors that cause reproducible histochemical, ultrastructural, and functional abnormalities in human brain aggregates."
6434,0.002,2.0,"The purpose of this study was to identify mutations in the basic core promoter and enhancer II region of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that might cause the HBV e antigen (HBeAg)-negative phenotype and contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis in black African carriers of the virus. The basic core promoter/enhancer II overlaps with the X gene. HBV DNA from serum of 47 asymptomatic carriers and 50 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and from 28 tumor and 10 nontumor liver tissues was amplified and sequenced directly. That part of the enhancer II region not overlapping the basic core promoter was completely conserved in all samples. Missense mutations at nucleotides 1809 and 1812 in the basic core promoter were found in 80% of all sequences and may represent wild-type sequence in Southern African isolates. Nucleotide and amino acid divergences were higher in the basic core promoter of hepatocellular carcinoma patients when compared with asymptomatic carriers (P <.0001). This applied particularly to the paired 1762 adenine to thymine (1762(T)) and 1764 guanine to adenine (1764(A)) missense mutations, the prevalence of which was 66% in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma compared with 11% in asymptomatic carriers (P <.0001). There was no association between the presence of 1762(T) 1764(A) and HBeAg negativity, although these mutations suppressed HBeAg titers in HBeAg-positive patients. Suppression of HBeAg expression as well as alteration of the amino acid sequence of the X protein may play a role in hepatocarcinogenesis."

The survey revealed that a total of 144 (9.2%) patients could be considered at risk of HIV infection (high-risk group) because of known seropositivity, admission to HIV high-risk factors or engaging in high-risk activities. The remaining 1421 patients who did not acknowledge any high-risk behaviour were classified as an 'unknown-risk' group. More than 70% of the HIV high-risk patient group were under the age of 30 years. A total of 275 (17.6%) patients presented with open wounds and/or needed hospitalization (23 [1.5%] high-risk patients). Of the 490 respondents who engaged in short term sexual relationships, 310 (63.3%) practised unprotected coitus, 32 of these including four seropositives were classified in the high-risk group. The patients were asked if they were in favour of an HIV testing service at their local A&E department; 1324 (86.6%) were in agreement 121 of whom were in the high-risk group. There was no significant difference (chi 2 = 0.093: P greater than 0.7) in opinion between the 'unknown risk' and high-risk patient groups on this matter."
7723,0.002,2.0,"Data collected in a routine clinical setting are frequently used to compare antiretroviral treatments for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Differences in the frequency of measurement of HIV RNA levels and CD4-positive T-lymphocyte cell counts introduce a possible source of bias into estimates of the difference in effectiveness between treatments. The authors investigated the size of this bias when survival analysis methods are used to compare the initial efficacy of antiretroviral regimens. Data sets of clinical markers were simulated by use of differential equations that model the interaction between HIV and human T-cells. Cox proportional hazards and parametric models were fitted to the simulated data sets to evaluate the bias and coverage of 95% confidence intervals for the difference between regimens. The authors' results demonstrate that differences in the frequency of follow-up can substantially bias estimated treatment differences if methods do not correctly account for the intervals between measurements and if the statistical model chosen does not fit the data well. Analyses using methods applicable to interval-censored data reduce the bias. In the Athena cohort of HIV-infected individuals in the Netherlands from 1999 to 2003, there are differences in measurement frequency between current regimens that are of sufficient magnitude to conclude incorrectly that some regimens are more effective than others."
977,0.002,2.0,"OBJECTIVE To present the development and validation of the WebAd-Q Questionnaire, a self-report instrument to monitor adherence to antiretroviral therapy in HIV/AIDS centers in Brazil. METHODS The WebAd-Q is an electronic questionnaire that has three questions about the use of antiretrovirals in the last week. It was constructed from interviews and focus groups with 38 patients. Its validity was tested in a study with a sample of 90 adult patients on antiretroviral therapy for at least three months. We used electronic monitoring bottles, pill counting, and self-report interview to compare adherence. The WebAd-Q was answered on the sixtieth day, twice, with at least one hour of interval. The viral load of the patients was obtained from the service records. We have analyzed the agreement between the answers to the WebAd-Q, the associations, and the correlations with viral load and performance compared to other measures of adherence. RESULTS Among the invited patients, 74 (82.2%) answered the WebAd-Q. No difficulties were reported to answer the questionnaire. The average answer time was 5 min 47 sec. The set of three questions of the WebAd-Q obtained agreement of 89.8%, with Kappa of 0.77 (95%CI 0.61-0.94). The non-adherence answers of the WebAd-Q were associated with detectable viral load. We obtained moderate viral load correlations with the non-adherence scale according to the WebAd-Q. For the three questions of the WebAd-Q, patients with non-adherence answers were also reported as less adherent according to the other measures of adherence. CONCLUSIONS The WebAd-Q answered all the issues considered relevant in the validation of questionnaires, was well understood by patients, was associated with viral load, and obtained good agreement and good performance compared to the other measures. The feasibility analysis of its implementation still depends on a national study on its applicability."
3066,0.002,2.0,"The results of an epidemiological survey in Spain organized by the ""Spanish Pediatric Association"" of children born to HIV+ mothers from 1981-1989 are presented. The objectives were, a) to document in the different parts of Spain the number of HIV+ children born to HIV+ mothers, and b) to identify the risk factors involved in the HIV infection. Only in public hospitals, a total of 1938 HIV+ children born to HIV+ mothers were identified. A systematic yearly increase of HIV+ newborns was evident since 1985. Madrid, Catalonia, Valencia, Basq and Andalucia communities incorporated 85% of all cases. 93% of mothers were IVDU and 51% of them were married. Prematurity occurred in 27% of cases and low birth weight in 33% of NB's. The rate of transmission in children over 18 months of age was 25.6% Breast feeding could be a risk factor in the transmission of HIV infection observed in children over 18 months of age. No other maternal risk factors responsible for the HIV transmission were identified. 12% of children died with AIDS. Clinical classification and evolution of HIV infection did not significantly differ from similar studies in other parts of the world. In spite of only public hospitals being involved, Spain has more identified HIV+ children than Italy, Switzerland, Federal Republic of Germany, United Kingdom, Sweden and Belgium combined. The pediatric centres with large number of cases require interdisciplinary pediatric specialized units to cope with the increase demand of medical services, now inadequate and insufficient. To fight drug use and HIV infection in Spain, health education and family support, are indispensable in trying to arrest the continuous spread the HIV infection."
7791,0.002,2.0,"Depletion of CD4+ T cells is one of the hallmarks of progression of HIV-1 infection. However, measurement of the CD4+ T-cell count is expensive and often unavailable in less developed areas. Previous studies have suggested that the total lymphocyte count (TLC) can be used to predict a low absolute CD4+ T-cell count. To determine the relationship between TLC and CD4+ T-cell count in HIV-1-infected South African patients, 2777 HIV-1-seropositive patients visiting the Immunology clinic at the Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein, South Africa from April 1991 to April 1997 were included in the study. In total, 3237 observations were used to determine sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, of various cutpoints of the TLC to predict an absolute CD4+ T-cell count of <200 cells/mm3, CD4+ percentage <20%, and CD4+ percentage <15%. Spearman rank correlations were calculated between TLC and CD4+ T cells, CD4+ percentage and CD8+ T cells, as well as between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Results demonstrated that a TLC of 2 x 10(9)/L or less had a sensitivity of 90.3% to detect patients with a CD4+ T-cell count of <200 cells/mm3, but a specificity of only 53.7%. When the TLC cutoff value was lowered, specificity increased but sensitivity decreased. For the observations as a group, a correlation (r = 0.704) between CD4+ T-cell count and TLC was demonstrated, but if the patients were divided into three groups according to their CD4+ T-cell count, this correlation weakened considerably. Therefore, although TLC shows a correlation with CD4+ T-cell count, it is not a good predictor of the CD4+ T-cell count in this population and should preferably not be used in the clinical care of HIV/AIDS patients."
3643,0.002,2.0,"In a retrospective study of 648 persons with HIV infection in Cambodia, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to start antiretroviral treatment based on clinical criteria alone or based on a combination of clinical symptoms and the total lymphocyte count. As a reference test, we used the 2003 WHO criteria, including the CD4 count. The 2003 WHO clinical criteria had a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 57%, and an accuracy of 89% to identify patients who need highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In our clinic, with a predominance of patients with advanced disease, the 2003 WHO clinical criteria alone was a good predictor of those needing HAART. A total lymphocyte count as an extra criterion did not improve the accuracy. Nine percent of patients were wrongly identified to be in need of HAART. Among them, almost 50% had a CD4 count of more than 500 cells/muL, and 73% had weight loss of more than 10% as a stage-defining condition. Our data suggest that, in settings with limited access to CD4 count testing, it might be useful to target this test to patients in WHO stage 3 whose staging is based on weight loss alone, to avoid unnecessary treatment."

The overall sensitivity and specificity were 34% and 98%, respectively. Using the current CD4 count criteria would globally result in 66% missed opportunity to initiate treatment in a timely fashion. Raising CD4 count thresholds should be considered to increase its sensitivity and reduce missed opportunity."
4491,0.002,2.0,"The naphthyridinone GSK364735 potently inhibited recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase in a strand transfer assay (mean 50% inhibitory concentration +/- standard deviation, 8 +/- 2 nM). As expected based on the structure of the drug, it bound competitively with another two-metal binding inhibitor (Kd [binding constant], 6 +/- 4 nM). In a number of different cellular assays, GSK364735 inhibited HIV replication with potency at nanomolar concentrations (e.g., in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and MT-4 cells, 50% effective concentrations were 1.2 +/- 0.4 and 5 +/- 1 nM, respectively), with selectivity indexes of antiviral activity versus in-assay cytotoxicity of at least 2,200. When human serum was added, the antiviral potency decreased (e.g., a 35-fold decrease in the presence of 100% human serum was calculated by extrapolation from the results of the MT-4 cell assay). In cellular assays, GSK364735 blocked viral DNA integration, with a concomitant increase in two-long-terminal-repeat circles. As expected, this integrase inhibitor was equally active against wild-type viruses and mutant viruses resistant to approved drugs targeting either reverse transcriptase or protease. In contrast, some but not all viruses resistant to other integrase inhibitors were resistant to GSK364735. When virus was passaged in the presence of the inhibitor, we identified resistance mutations within the integrase active site that were the same as or similar to mutations arising in response to other two-metal binding inhibitors. Finally, either additive or synergistic effects were observed when GSK364735 was tested in combination with approved antiretrovirals (i.e., no antagonistic effects were seen). Thus, based on all the data, GSK364735 exerted potent antiviral activity through the inhibition of viral DNA integration by interacting at the two-metal binding site within the catalytic center of HIV integrase."

6710,0.002,2.0,"The last international consensus conference about hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment emphasized the importance of treatment for persons coinfected with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As liver biopsy precedes treatment, we aimed to identify factors associated with the performance of liver biopsy among HIV-HCV coinfected drug users during a 5-year follow-up to study their access to HCV treatment. Of the 296 patients followed in the HIV hospital departments of Nice and Marseilles and with retrievable records about HCV diagnosis and care, 166 were eligible for analysis having had detectable HCV RNA at least once during the study period. Overall, 45.2% of patients underwent liver biopsy during follow-up. Using proportional hazard models, predictors of having had a liver biopsy were high social support, complete abstinence from drug injection, and lack of immunosuppression as well as male gender, no history of multiple incarcerations, more recent onset of drug use, and an increase of liver enzyme levels. These results suggest that specific efforts should be devoted to HIV-HCV coinfected drug users to assist with stabilizing these patients to optimize their access to HCV care whenever possible."

3598,0.002,2.0,"To investigate whether low CD4+ T-cell counts in healthy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected Ethiopians influence tuberculosis (TB) immunological memory, tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion and reactivity rates were investigated among adults with and without HIV infection in urban settings in Ethiopia. Reaction to the TST was analyzed with purified protein derivative by the Mantoux technique. A total of 1,286 individuals with TST results of > or = 5-mm (n = 851) and < or = 4-mm (n = 435) induration diameters were included. Individuals with < or = 4-mm induration sizes were followed up for 21.4 +/- 9.5 months (mean +/- standard deviation) to observe skin test conversion. The overall TST reactivity (> or = 5-mm induration diameter) was 66.2% (n = 851). Reactivity was significantly lower among HIV-positive persons (40.5%) than among HIV-negative persons (68.7%) (P < 0.001). Of the above persons, 32 incident TB patients were checked for their TST status 13.05 +/- 11.1 months before diagnosis and reactivity was found among 22 (68.7%) of them. Of the TST-negative persons with 0- to 4-mm indurations who were followed up for 3 years, the conversion rate to positivity was 17.9/100 person-years of observation (PYO) (14.4/100 PYO and 18.3/100 PYO in HIV-positive and -negative persons, respectively). Despite lower absolute CD4+ T-cell numbers in Ethiopians, higher TST conversion and reactivity rates show the presence of a higher rate of latent TB infection and/or transmission. The lower TST positivity rate before a diagnosis of TB disease showed the lower sensitivity of the test. This indicates the need for other sensitive and specific diagnostic and screening methods to detect TB infection, particularly among HIV-positive persons, so that they can be given prophylactic isoniazid therapy."
3151,0.002,2.0,"Transient worsening of tuberculous symptomatology and lesions following antituberculous therapy (paradoxical response) has previously been described as a rare occurrence. To determine the incidence of paradoxical responses in patients with AIDS and TB who are treated with antituberculous therapy and subsequently with combination antiretroviral therapy (ARV), we conducted a prospective study of 33 HIV-seropositive TB patients treated with anti-TB therapy and antiretroviral therapy (Group 1) compared with 55 HIV-seronegative TB patients treated with anti-TB therapy (Group 2) and 28 HIV-seropositive TB patients treated with anti-TB therapy but not on antiretrovirals (historical control; Group 3). In Group 1 patients, paradoxical responses were temporally more related to the initiation of ARV than to the initiation of anti-TB therapy (mean +/- SD: 15 +/- 11 d versus 109 +/- 72 d [p < 0.001]) and occurred much more frequently (12 of 33; 36%) compared with Group 2 (1 of 55; 2%) (p < 0.001) or with Group 3 (2 of 28; 7%) (p = 0.013). The majority of patients who experienced paradoxical responses and received tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) in Group 1 had their tuberculin skin tests convert from negative to strongly positive after ARV. These observations suggest that a paradoxical response associated with enhanced tuberculin skin reactivity may occur after the initiation of ARV in HIV-infected TB patients. Furthermore, the skin test conversion after the initiation of ARV may have important public health implications."

1729,0.002,2.0,"Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is currently treated with IFN-α and nucleos(t)ide analogues, which have many clinical benefits, but there is no ultimate cure. The major problem consists in the persistence of cccDNA in infected hepatocytes. Because no antiviral drug has been evaluated which significantly reduces copies of cccDNA, cytolytic and noncytolytic approaches are needed. Effective virus-specific T- and B-cell responses remain crucial in eliminating cccDNA-carrying hepatocytes and for the long-term control of HBV infection. Reduction of viremia by antiviral drugs provides a window for reconstitution of an HBV-specific immune response. Preclinical studies in mice and woodchucks have shown that immunostimulatory strategies, such as prime-boost vaccination and PD-1 blockade, can boost a weak virus-specific T cell response and lead to effective control of HBV infection. Based on data obtained in our preclinical studies, the combination of antiviral drugs and immunomodulators may control HBV viremia during a patient's drug-off period. In this article, we review current immune-modulatory approaches for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and the elimination of cccDNA in preclinical models. This article forms part of a symposium in Antiviral Research on ""An unfinished story: from the discovery of the Australia antigen to the development of new curative therapies for hepatitis"". "
9532,0.002,2.0,"In vitro, recombinant soluble CD4 (rsCD4) attaches to and inactivates human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To determine if prolonged therapy with high-dose intravenous rsCD4 provides an in vivo benefit, we gave three HIV-1-infected patients with AIDS, whose isolates were susceptible in vitro to rsCD4, 10 mg/kg of rsCD4 for 4 weeks, 5 mg/kg for 4 weeks, and 1 mg/kg for 2 weeks. Single-dose pharmacokinetic studies performed prior to this showed transient in vivo decreases of HIV-1 plasma viremia in all three subjects. Surrogate markers of HIV activity, clinical status, HIV-1 p24 antigen, plasma HIV-1 titers, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) intracellular titers of virus were measured at entry, and every other week after onset of therapy. All subjects demonstrated rsCD4 concentration-dependent reduction in plasma viremia, with two subjects having complete neutralization of cell-free virus. The third subject's isolate was relatively resistant to the in vivo effects of rsCD4 and only partial reduction in plasma virus titers was obtained, even at the highest dose of 10 mg/kg. There was no change in the PBMC intracellular viral titer or surrogate markers of HIV-1 activity (including CD4 cell count and beta 2-microglobulin). There was subjective improvement in clinical symptoms, and all subjects gained weight with the highest doses of rsCD4. rsCD4 exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range studied. We conclude that high-dose intravenous rsCD4 can be safely given for up to 10 weeks and that it has a stable pharmacokinetic profile.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5572,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection disrupts the intestinal immune system, leading to microbial translocation and systemic immune activation. We investigated the impact of HIV-1 infection on the intestinal microbiome and its association with mucosal T-cell and dendritic cell (DC) frequency and activation, as well as with levels of systemic T-cell activation, inflammation, and microbial translocation. Bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing was performed on colon biopsies and fecal samples from subjects with chronic, untreated HIV-1 infection and uninfected control subjects. Colon biopsies of HIV-1-infected subjects had increased abundances of Proteobacteria and decreased abundances of Firmicutes compared with uninfected donors. Furthermore at the genus level, a significant increase in Prevotella and decrease in Bacteroides was observed in HIV-1-infected subjects, indicating a disruption in the Bacteroidetes bacterial community structure. This HIV-1-associated increase in Prevotella abundance was associated with increased numbers of activated colonic T cells and myeloid DCs. Principal coordinates analysis demonstrated an HIV-1-related change in the microbiome that was associated with increased mucosal cellular immune activation, microbial translocation, and blood T-cell activation. These observations suggest that an important relationship exists between altered mucosal bacterial communities and intestinal inflammation during chronic HIV-1 infection. "
3306,0.002,2.0,"We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of inosine pranobex (Isoprinosine) [corrected] in the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection but without manifest acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). A total of 866 patients were enrolled in 21 centers in Denmark and Sweden. The patients were stratified in three groups according to their CD4+ cell count and randomly assigned to receive either inosine pranobex (1 g three times a day) (n = 429) or matching placebo (n = 437) for 24 weeks. Of the 831 patients who could be evaluated, AIDS developed in 17 in the placebo group as compared with 2 in the inosine pranobex group (P less than 0.001; odds ratio, 8.6 [95 percent confidence limits, 2.2 and 52.6]). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to changes in CD4+ cell count or the development of other HIV-related conditions, with the exception of thrush, which developed in fewer patients in the inosine pranobex group (P = 0.05). No serious side effects were observed. We conclude that treatment with inosine pranobex delays progression to AIDS in patients with HIV infection. The duration of this beneficial effect, the optimal dose, and the mode of action of inosine pranobex remain to be clarified."
5700,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the public-health issues worldwide. Approximately two billion people are infected with HBV, and about 350 million people are chronic carriers globally. About 3% of the world population is infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Oncology patients receiving packed red blood cell suspensions and other blood products usually are in the high-risk group for infections due to these viruses. The aim of the study was to detect the seroprevalence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C among chemotherapy patients at the Oncology Department of the Tepecik Education and Research Hospital. HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBcIgM, anti-HBc total and anti-HCV assays were studied by enzyme immunoassay method (Diasorin, Italy) in serum samples of patients (n = 448) referred to the Department of Oncology of the Tepecik Education and Research Hospital during 1 June 2006-1 January 2007. Of the 448 patients, 19 (4.2%) were HBsAg-positive, and three (0.7%) had anti-HCV positivity. In this study, the seroprevalence of HBV was similar to previous data in Turkey. This could be due to widespread vaccination programmes. The seroprevalence of low anti-HCV may be because of controlled blood transfusion. Oncology patients should be monitored for their protective antibody levels against HBV, and they must be included in the vaccination programme. Their anti-HCV status should also be checked as well."
5997,0.002,2.0,"We compared the lymphoproliferative and cytokine responses to Cryptosporidium parvum in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive and -seronegative patients. The lymphoproliferative and cytokine responses (interleukin-2 [IL-2], IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, gamma interferon, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) were assessed for 11 HIV-seropositive, Cryptosporidium-positive (group I) patients; 20 HIV-seropositive, Cryptosporidium-negative (group II) patients; 10 HIV-seronegative, Cryptosporidium-positive (group III) patients, including four post-renal transplant (group IIIa) and 6 presumably immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients; and 20 HIV-seronegative, Cryptosporidium-negative healthy individuals (group IV). No significant difference was observed in the number of patients showing positive lymphoproliferative responses in group I compared to group III (post-renal transplant [group IIIa] or immunocompetent [group IIIb]) patients, while a comparison of the median stimulation indices shows that responses were significantly lower in Cryptosporidium-infected, immunosuppressed (group I and IIIa) patients than in immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients. The number of patients showing positive responses and median stimulation indices was significantly higher for Cryptosporidium-infected (HIV-seropositive and -seronegative) individuals than for uninfected individuals, suggesting that Cryptosporidium induces significant in vitro lymphoproliferative responses in infected individuals. Cytokine levels, except for that of IL-5, were significantly higher in Cryptosporidium-infected (groups I and III) individuals than in uninfected (groups II and IV) individuals. There was no significant difference between the group I and III patients and between Cryptosporidium-infected immunosuppressed (group I or IIIa) and immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients."
9157,0.002,2.0,"JC virus (JCV) infection is regularly asymptomatic in healthy individuals. In contrast, in immunocompromised individuals, highly activated virus replication may lead to PML. Peripheral blood cells (PBCs) are found to harbor JCV DNA in healthy and diseased individuals and it is discussed that they might be responsible for dissemination of the virus to the central nervous system (CNS) during persistence. To better understand the role of JCV DNA in PBCs for persistent infection and pathogenesis, the authors characterized the extent of JCV infection in Ficoll-gradient purified blood cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs]) of healthy and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals. Virus activation in PBMCs from healthy JCV-infected individuals was found at a rate of 0% to 38% at low polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sensitivity. In progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) patients, a stronger signal was found, indicating increased virus activation. JCV DNA was regularly detected in T and B lymphocytes and in monocytes at low levels. However, granulocytes were shown to be the predominant reservoir of JCV DNA harboring high copy numbers. Although the overall distribution of viral genomes holds true for the population studied, in the individual, a markedly changed pattern of distribution can be found."
2279,0.002,2.0,"A common severe complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Recently, with increasing use of PCP prophylaxis and multidrug antiretroviral therapy, the clinical manifestations of HIV infection have changed dramatically and the predictors of inpatient mortality for PCP may have also changed. We developed a new staging system for predicting inpatient mortality for patients with HIV-associated PCP admitted between 1995 and 1997. Trained abstractors performed chart reviews of 1,660 patients hospitalized with HIV-associated PCP between 1995 and 1997 at 78 hospitals in seven metropolitan areas in the United States. The overall inpatient mortality rate was 11.3%. Hierarchically optimal classification tree analysis identified an ordered five-category staging system based on three predictors: wasting, alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (AaPO(2)), and serum albumin level. The mortality rate increased with stage: 3.7% for Stage 1, 8.5% for Stage 2, 16.1% for Stage 3, 23.3% for Stage 4, and 49.1% for Stage 5. This new staging system may be useful for severity of illness adjustment in the current era while exploring current variation in HIV-associated PCP inpatient mortality rates among hospitals and across cities."
2859,0.002,2.0,"Numerous studies now support that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution is influenced by immune selection pressure, with population studies showing an association between specific HLA alleles and mutations within defined cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes. Here we combine sequence data and functional studies of CD8 T-cell responses to demonstrate that allele-specific immune pressures also select for mutations flanking CD8 epitopes that impair antigen processing. In persons expressing HLA-A3, we demonstrate consistent selection for a mutation in a C-terminal flanking residue of the normally immunodominant Gag KK9 epitope that prevents its processing and presentation, resulting in a rapid decline in the CD8 T-cell response. This single amino acid substitution also lies within a second HLA-A3-restricted epitope, with the mutation directly impairing recognition by CD8 T cells. Transmission of the mutation to subjects expressing HLA-A3 was shown to prevent the induction of normally immunodominant acute-phase responses to both epitopes. However, subsequent in vivo reversion of the mutation was coincident with delayed induction of new CD8 T-cell responses to both epitopes. These data demonstrate that mutations within the flanking region of an HIV-1 epitope can impair recognition by an established CD8 T-cell response and that transmission of these mutations alters the acute-phase CD8(+) T-cell response. Moreover, reversion of these mutations in the absence of the original immune pressure reveals the potential plasticity of immunologically selected evolutionary changes."
8377,0.002,2.0,"The addition of adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) to ongoing lamivudine therapy is effective against lamivudine-resistant virus in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We studied 39 patients who received ADV added to lamivudine for breakthrough hepatitis. We determined early viral changes (12 weeks) in YMDD mutants (rtM204I [YIDD sequence], rtM204V [YVDD]) and rtL180M in all 39 patients as well as amino acid changes in the polymerase reverse transcriptase (rt) region and precore/core promoter mutations in 15 patients who received long-term treatment (more than 1 year). Changes in rtM204I and rtL180M viral loads were greater than that of the rtM204V, albeit statistically insignificant. Moreover, the greatest change in viral load was seen for rtM204I without hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). The precore mutant was replaced with wild-type virus in three of eight patients after 1 year of added ADV therapy. Compared to baseline with lamivudine therapy only, new amino acid mutations were seen in the rt region at baseline with ADV in seven patients. At 1 year after ADV coadministration, the YMDD motif was replaced with wild-type (rt204M) in two patients, in whom mutations were fewer and of a different type. We conclude that the rtM204I may be more sensitive to ADV in vivo. ADV tended to select wild-type virus from precore mutants. Moreover, viruses that were wild-type in the rt region reappeared after 1 year of ADV coadministration in some patients."
9559,0.002,2.0,"HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses limit viral replication in untreated infection. After the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), these responses decay and the infected cell population that remains is commonly considered to be invisible to T-cells. We hypothesized that HIV antigen recognition may persist in ART-treated individuals due to low-level or episodic protein expression. We posited that if persistent recognition were occurring it would be preferentially directed against the early HIV gene products Nef, Tat, and Rev as compared to late gene products, such as Gag, Pol, and Env, which have higher barriers to expression. Using a primary cell model of latency, we observed that a Nef-specific CD8+ T-cell clone exhibited low-level recognition of infected cells prior to reactivation and robust recognition shortly thereafter. A Gag-specific CD8+ T-cell clone failed to recognized infected cells under these conditions, corresponding with a lack of detectable Gag expression. We measured HIV-specific T-cell responses in 96 individuals who had been suppressed on ART for a median of 7 years, and observed a significant, direct correlation between cell-associated HIV DNA levels and magnitudes of IFN-γ-producing Nef/Tat/Rev-specific T-cell responses. This correlation was confirmed in an independent cohort (n = 18). Correlations were not detected between measures of HIV persistence and T-cell responses to other HIV antigens. The correlation with Nef/Tat/Rev-specific T-cells was attributable to Nef-specific responses, the breadth of which also correlated with HIV DNA levels. These results suggest that ongoing Nef expression in ART-treated individuals drives preferential maintenance and/or expansion of T-cells reactive to this protein, implying sensing of infected cells by the immune system. The direct correlation, however, suggests that recognition does not result in efficient elimination of infected cells. These results raise the possibility that enhancing the cytolytic activity of Nef-specific T-cells may lead to reductions in infected cell frequencies, even in the absence of therapeutic latency reversal."
