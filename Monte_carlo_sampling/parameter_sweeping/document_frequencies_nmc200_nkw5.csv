15050,0.035,7.0000,"To examine the influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on complications in dialysis access surgery, a review was performed on patients undergoing hemodialysis at two major metropolitan medical centers over a 30-month period. One hundred eight patients underwent a total of 169 graft procedures; mean follow-up was 14 1/2 months. There were 18 (17%) patients who were HIV-positive who had no symptoms, 11 (10%) patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and 79 (73%) patients who were HIV-negative. Twenty-three percent (25/108) of patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA), most of whom also had either AIDS or asymptomatic HIV infection. Dialysis procedures included 44 autogenous reconstructions (26%), 117 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts (69%), and 8 (5%) procedures of unknown type. Arteriovenous fistula or graft thrombosis was a frequent complication. The overall 12-month graft patency rate was 41%, and patients with HIV infection or a history of IVDA did not have a significantly increased risk of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that the use of PTFE as opposed to autogenous reconstruction was the only significant risk factor found for occlusion within the first 12 months after operation (p < 0.01). Twenty-five graft infections occurred, all in PTFE grafts. The PTFE graft infection rate was 43% in patients with AIDS, 36% in patients who were HIV-positive and who had no symptoms, and 15% in patients who were HIV-negative (p < 0.05). Patients with a history of IVDA had a 41% PTFE graft infection rate versus a 13% infection rate in patients who did not have a history of IVDA (p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
640,0.035,7.0000,"Although China's government is rapidly expanding access to antiretroviral therapy, little is known about barriers to adherence among Chinese HIV-infected patients, particularly among injection drug users. To better understand barriers to antiretroviral treatment adherence, we conducted a qualitative research study, using both focus group and key informant methods, among 36 HIV-positive men and women in Dali, in southwestern China. All interviews utilized semi-structured question guides and were conducted in Mandarin, audio-recorded and translated into English for analysis. The most commonly cited adherence challenges were stigma, including secondary stigma experienced by family members; mental health issues; and economic concerns, particularly related to finding and maintaining employment. Distinctive gender differences emerged, partly due to previous heroin use among male respondents. Optimizing adherence may require that antiretroviral therapy programs be linked to other services, including drug addiction treatment, mental health services and vocational treatment and support. HIV care and service providers and policy makers in China responsible for HIV treatment should be aware of these important barriers to adherence."
3012,0.035,7.0000,"This article describes the psychological distress experienced by family members living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Survey data were collected from 133 individuals, (47 parents, 53 siblings, 33 adult family members who have HIV/AIDS) representing 80 families. In-depth interview and observational data were collected from a subset of the sample. The physical and psychological health of individual family members was assessed by the 53-item Brief Symptom Inventory. Parents, siblings, and people living with AIDS (PWAs) reported higher levels of overall distress and scored higher on symptom dimensions and clinically discrete symptoms than normative comparison groups. Implications of these findings for research, clinical practice, and health and social service policy are identified and discussed."
2148,0.035,7.0000,"In this multicenter study, we investigated the prognostic factors that influence the risk of death in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Clinical and laboratory indices obtained from 161 HIV-seropositive patients who underwent a detailed morphologic and immunophenotypic evaluation of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood cell populations were retrospectively analyzed. In 155 patients, death occurred within the 48-mo follow-up (mean follow-up: 14.8 mo; range: 1 to 48 mo). In the univariate analysis, the patient's age (> 30 yr), HIV disease status, HIV transmission category, number of opportunistic pathogens isolated from the BAL, percentage of BAL neutrophils, and low number of BAL CD4 T cells were predictive of increased mortality. In contrast, the presence of an alveolitis or an increase in the numbers of alveolar macrophages and CD3 T cells was associated with a decreased mortality. In the multivariate analysis, significant independent predictors were age, risk factor for HIV, and presence of an alveolitis. Furthermore, patients with a low number of BAL CD4 T cells had a particularly poor prognosis while the CD4 T-cell count in the peripheral blood (< 50 cells/mm3 in the majority of our patients) had a negligible effect on predicting survival. Our findings suggest the clinical utility of BAL analysis in patients infected with HIV."
16463,0.035,7.0000,"Injecting drug use is commonly reported among gay and bisexual men in Australia. We examined the prevalence and covariates of injecting drug use among men participating in the Sydney Gay Community Periodic Survey between 2004-06 and 2011. In 2004-06, data was collected about which drugs were injected, while in 2011, data was collected about hepatitis C (HCV) and esoteric sexual practices. In 2004-06, 5.6 % of men reported injecting drugs in the previous 6 months; 3.4 % reported methamphetamine injection and 0.4 % heroin injection. In 2011, men who injected drugs were less likely to be employed full-time, and more likely to be HCV-positive, HIV-positive, to have used party drugs for sex, and to have engaged in esoteric sexual practices. The strong associations between injecting drug use, sexual risk practices and blood-borne virus infection suggests the need for combined sexual health and harm reduction services for gay and bisexual men who inject drugs."
19874,0.025,5.0000,"CC genotype of SNP rs 12979860 promotes spontaneous HCV clearance in monoinfected patients. The aim of this analysis was evaluation of impact of rs12979860 polymorphism on HIV or HCV viral load, CD3, CD4 and CD8 count as well as HCV clearance among HCV/HIV coinfected patients."
6491,0.025,5.0000,"The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the genetic pattern (GP) defined by the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs14158 of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and rs12979860 of interleukin-28B (IL28B) genes on the outcome and features of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. 314 HIV/HCV-coinfected and 109 HCV-monoinfected patients treated with pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV), as well as 51 patients with HCV spontaneous clearance (SC), were included. Variations in both SNPs were determined by the TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. In the 286 patients chronically infected by HCV genotypes 1 or 4, both rs14158 CC and rs12979860 CC were associated with a higher rate of sustained virological response (SVR), and these effects were complementary in both HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Thus, 24 % of patients with rs14158/rs12979860 TT-TC/TT-TC, 33 % with TT-TC/CC, 44.2 % with CC/TT-TC, and 75.8 % harboring CC/CC attained SVR (p < 0.001). SC was associated with the IL28B genotype (66.7 % CC in SC vs. 42.6 % among those with chronic infection, p < 0.001) but not with the LDLR genotype. There was no association between GP and the plasma level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or the presence of advanced fibrosis. There is a complementary effect between the IL28B and LDLR genotypes on the probability of achieving SVR after Peg-IFN/RBV therapy in patients with HCV 1 or 4. Thus, the predictive value of IL28B genotype is modulated by the LDLR genotype in both HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. This complementary effect of both genotypes is also observed on the plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)."
12251,0.025,5.0000,"Sexual contact is the major mode of HIV transmission. Increased sexual risk taking has been described in HIV-infected individuals receiving potent antiretroviral therapy. A new questionnaire on sexual behavior was introduced into the Swiss HIV Cohort Study on April 1, 2000. We evaluated sexual behavior in all individuals who completed the questionnaire for the first time within 1 year after its introduction. Our primary hypothesis was that self-reported unsafe sexual behavior would be more prevalent among individuals with optimal viral suppression. On April 1, 2000, 4948 individuals were registered in the study, and 4723 (95%) completed the questionnaire. Of these individuals, 12% reported unsafe sex, 78% received antiretroviral therapy, and 25% had optimal viral suppression (HIV RNA level always <50 copies/mL during the preceding 12 months). During the preceding 6 months, 55% of individuals had stable and 19% had occasional partners, and 6% had both types of partners. Sexual intercourse was reported by 82% of individuals with stable and 87% of individuals with occasional partners, and of those reporting sexual intercourse in each group, 76% and 86%, respectively, said that they always used condoms. After adjustment for covariates, reported unsafe sex was not associated with optimal viral suppression (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.33) or antiretroviral therapy (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.07), but it was associated with gender, age, ethnicity, HIV transmission group, HIV status of partner, having occasional partners, and living alone. There is no evidence that self-reported unsafe sexual behavior is more prevalent among HIV-infected individuals with optimal viral suppression. However, unsafe sex is associated with other factors."
9446,0.025,5.0000,"Inflammatory muscle involvement during the course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is described and guidelines are suggested for its differentiation from the myopathy associated with azidothymidine (AZT) therapy. Six patients infected with HIV presented with proximal muscle weakness, biochemical and electromyographic abnormalities consistent with myositis. One patient had a skin rash characteristic of dermatomyositis. Muscle biopsy findings demonstrated the presence of an inflammatory cell infiltrate and HIV-p24 antigen. All patients developed their clinical picture prior to AZT therapy and responded to steroids with or without coadministration of AZT."
1953,0.025,5.0000,"The role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) function and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in HIV-related atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unclear. Both glycation and oxidation (HDLox) are major modifications of HDL that can alter its composition and function. Therefore, we explored the longitudinal association of HDLox with progression of glycation, as evaluated by measurement of circulating forms of receptor for AGE that predict morbidity (soluble Receptors for Advanced Glycation Endproducts [sRAGE], endogenous secretory Receptors for Advanced Glycation Endproducts [esRAGE]), in people with HIV-1 (PWH; HIV-1) and uninfected (HIV-1) individuals.We retrospectively assessed if levels of plasma sRAGE and esRAGE and HDL function (reduced antioxidant function is associated with increased HDL lipid hydroperoxide content; HDLox) in a subset of participants (n = 80) from a prospective 3-year study (AIDS Clinical Trials Group A5078). Primary outcomes were baseline and yearly rates of change over 96 of 144 weeks (Δ) in HDLox in HIV-1 versus uninfected HIV-1 controls (noted as HIV-1).Higher baseline levels of sRAGE in PWH on effective anti-retroviral therapy and with low CVD risk, but not in HIV-1 persons, were independently associated with higher HDLox. EsRAGE, but not sRAGE, had consistent inverse relationships with ΔHDLox in both HIV-1 and HIV-1 persons at baseline. In HIV-1 but not in HIV-1 persons, ΔHDLox had positive and inverse relationships with ΔRAGE and ΔesRAGE, respectively.Glycation and oxidation of HDL may contribute to impaired HDL function present in PWH."
11609,0.02,4.0000,"Hypogonadism is a common complication among HIV infected patients. The prevalence of hypogonadism is 30 to 50% in HIV infected men with wasting syndrome and 20 to 25% in those without wasting syndrome. HIV infection affects the entire hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis via both direct and indirect effects, which are defined in four categories, 1) direct effect of HIV particles, 2) opportunistic infections, 3) HIV-related malignancy and its treatment, and 4) medications that are used for HIV infection or its opportunistic infection. The association between HIV infection, hypogonadism, and cardiovascular diseases has yet to be determined; however, there are data that HIV infection and its treatment, particularly protease inhibitors, worsened the metabolic profiles, which were surrogate markers of cardiovascular diseases. Considerably more attention should be paid to the diagnosis of hypogonadism in this group particularly because HIV infection increases both sex hormone-binding globulin and total testosterone level. Testosterone replacement shows benefits on mood, body composition, and seems to benefit the metabolic profile in HIV infected men with low body mass index."
1634,0.02,4.0000,"Presented here are the results of a cohort study conducted on 3,483 consecutive HIV/AIDS patients between January 1993 and December 2000 to determine trends in AIDS incidence and presentation. The incidence of AIDS was calculated in the general population and examined further according to gender, age (< or = or >49 years), and heterosexual behaviour as a risk factor for HIV. Multivariate analysis was used to identify variables associated with AIDS presenters (defined as patients diagnosed with AIDS within 1 month of the first HIV-positive test). The numbers of patients with AIDS classified as (i) AIDS presenters, (ii) known HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral treatment, and (iii) known HIV-positive patients not receiving antiretroviral treatment were calculated. The overall incidence of AIDS decreased over time, mainly due to the lower number of patients on antiretroviral treatment developing AIDS. Factors associated with a higher risk of being an AIDS presenter were male gender and year of HIV diagnosis. Among patients with AIDS, the proportion of AIDS presenters increased from 13.8% prior to 1997 (when protease inhibitors were introduced in Italy) to 32.5% after 1997. Variables predictive of being an AIDS presenter were male gender, age at diagnosis, and AIDS diagnosis in the years 1997-2000. Heterosexuals had a higher risk of being AIDS presenters and a lower risk of being HIV-positive and not receiving antiretroviral treatment than intravenous drug users. In Italy, AIDS occurs mainly in subjects unaware of their HIV status (especially males, the elderly, and those infected heterosexually) or in patients refusing antiretroviral therapy (mainly intravenous drug users who do not refer to specialised centres)."
14016,0.02,4.0000,"Bone disorders such as osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteonecrosis have been reported in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the etiology and mechanism of these disorders are unknown. The prevalence estimates vary widely among studies and may be influenced by the presence or absence of antiretroviral therapy and lipodystrophy, severity of HIV disease, and overlapping bone loss risk factors. Addressing potential underlying bone disease risk factors (e.g., smoking and alcohol intake), evaluating calcium and vitamin D intake, and performing dual x-ray absorptiometry in patients with HIV who have risks for bone disease are important strategies in preventing osteopenia and osteoporosis in HIV-infected patients. Management of osteopenia and osteoporosis is still being evaluated. Administration of bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate), with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, may be reasonable in treating osteoporosis; however, surgical intervention is the only method for treating symptomatic osteonecrosis."
4498,0.02,4.0000,"A significant number of men who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have low testosterone levels. Androgen deficiency in HIV-infected patients is associated with decreased muscle mass and function, and adverse disease outcome. Administration of replacement doses of testosterone to healthy hypogonadal men augments lean body mass, muscle size, and maximal voluntary strength. Recent studies have shown that physiologic testosterone replacement in HIV-infected men with weight loss who have low testosterone levels can also increase muscle mass and effort-dependent strength. However, further studies are needed to determine whether androgen therapy can improve physical function and health-related outcomes in HIV-infected men."
13876,0.02,4.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections spontaneously clear in approximately 15-45% of infected individuals. Factors which influence spontaneous HCV clearance remain to be identified. The purpose of the present study was to identify variables associated with spontaneous HCV clearance in a referred population of Chinese patients. The prevalence of host, viral, and environmental factors known to influence the outcome of HCV infections was compared in 92 HCV spontaneous clearance subjects and 318 HCV persistent infection subjects. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify those factors associated with spontaneous HCV clearance. In univariate analysis, female gender, a history of icteric hepatitis, serologic evidence of concurrent HBV infection, and rs12979860 CC genotype were positively associated with spontaneous HCV clearance, while alcohol consumption was negatively associated with clearance. In multivariate analysis, female gender, a history of icteric hepatitis, concurrent HBV infection, and rs12979860 CC genotype remained independent variables associated with spontaneous HCV clearance. Spontaneous HCV clearance is more likely to occur in females, subjects with a history of icteric hepatitis, HBV coinfections, and those with the rs12979860 CC genotype. "
16926,0.02,4.0000,"The clinical consequences of androgen deficiency in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women remain underappreciated. The pharmacokinetics of transdermally administered testosterone in premenopausal women and HIV-infected women have not been studied. In this study we compared the pharmacokinetics of a novel testosterone matrix transdermal system (TMTDS) in healthy premenopausal women and women infected with HIV. Eight menstruating HIV-infected women, 18-50 yr of age, who had been receiving stable antiretroviral therapy, including a protease inhibitor, for at least 12 weeks and nine healthy, menstruating women of comparable age were enrolled. After baseline sampling during a 24-h control period in the early follicular phase (days 1-6), two TMTDS patches were applied with an expected delivery rate of 300 microg testosterone daily over an application period of 3-4 days. After 72 h, the patches were removed, a second set of two patches was applied, and blood samples were drawn over 96 h. Baseline serum total and free testosterone levels were lower in HIV-infected women than in healthy women. A diurnal rhythm of testosterone secretion, with higher levels in the morning and lower levels in the late afternoon, was apparent in both groups of women. Free testosterone levels were in the midnormal range at baseline in healthy women and increased above the upper limit of normal during TMTDS application. In HIV-infected women, free testosterone levels were in the low normal range at baseline and rose into the upper normal range during patch application. Serum total testosterone levels increased into the midnormal range in HIV-infected women and into the upper normal range in healthy women during patch application. The mean increments in free and total testosterone levels were significantly lower in HIV-infected women than in healthy women. Testosterone bioavailability, expressed as the mean +/- SEM baseline-subtracted area under the total testosterone curve, was significantly greater in healthy women than in HIV-infected women [3323 +/- 566 ng/dL x h (115 +/- 20 nmol/L x h) vs. 1506 +/- 316 ng/dL x h (52 +/- 11 nmol/ L x h); P = 0.016]. Assuming a daily testosterone delivery rate of 300 microg/day, the apparent plasma clearance was significantly higher in HIV-infected women than in healthy women (2531 +/- 469 vs. 1127 +/- 217 L/day1 P = 0.022), respectively. There was no significant change from baseline in serum LH, sex hormone-binding globulin, and estradiol levels in either group. Serum FSH levels showed a greater decrease from baseline in healthy women. A regimen of two testosterone patches applied twice a week can maintain serum total and free testosterone levels in the mid- to upper normal range, respectively, in HIV-infected women with low testosterone levels. During TMTDS application, the increments in serum total and free testosterone levels are lower in HIV-infected women than in healthy women, presumably due to increased plasma clearance or decreased absorption. Further studies are needed to assess the effects of physiological androgen replacement in HIV-infected women."
17613,0.02,4.0000,"Anemia, the most common hematological disorder in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is associated with decreased quality of life and survival. Hypogonadism is prevalent in advanced HIV disease, however, low testosterone levels have not been customarily implicated in HIV-associated anemia. This study was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between testosterone levels and androgen use with anemia in HIV, and to characterize other clinical correlates of HIV-associated anemia. This was a cross-sectional, observational study of 200 HIV-positive patients at a public hospital HIV clinic from July 2000 to August 2001. A written questionnaire detailed previous and current medication use, opportunistic infections, and malignancies. Hematological and virological parameters, testosterone, and erythropoietin levels were measured; CD4(+) T lymphocyte count and viral load nadir and peak levels were obtained from the computerized medical record. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin <13.5 g/dl in men and <11.6 g/dl in women. Twenty-four percent of women and 28% of men were anemic. Anemia was associated with lymphopenia (adjusted OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.36-11.80), high erythropoietin levels (adjusted OR 7.73, 95% CI 2.92-20.48), and low testosterone levels (adjusted OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.01-10.60). Anemia was negatively associated with female sex (adjusted OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.85), current antiretroviral therapy (adjusted OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20-0.95), current androgen use (adjusted OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.84), and macrocytosis (adjusted OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.61). Low testosterone levels may have a positive association and supplemental androgens a negative association with anemia in HIV disease."
6120,0.02,4.0000,"Orthotopic liver transplantation has an established role for the treatment of patients with chronic liver failure secondary to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Unfortunately, recurrent infection of the graft can be associated with aggressive disease, and with diminished graft and patient survival. Currently, the role of nucleoside analogues for prevention of graft re-infection is being evaluated. Preliminary results are encouraging, but treatment failure has been associated with emergence of drug-resistant virus."
14248,0.02,4.0000,"Although weight loss associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is multifactorial in its pathogenesis, it has been speculated that hypogonadism, a common occurrence in HIV disease, contributes to depletion of lean tissue and muscle dysfunction. We, therefore, examined the effects of testosterone replacement by means of Androderm, a permeation-enhanced, nongenital transdermal system, on lean body mass, body weight, muscle strength, health-related quality of life, and HIV-disease markers. We randomly assigned 41 HIV-infected, ambulatory men, 18-60 yr of age, with serum testosterone levels below 400 ng/dL, to 1 of 2 treatment groups: group I, two placebo patches (n = 21); or group II, two testosterone patches designed to release 5 mg testosterone over 24 h. Eighteen men in the placebo group and 14 men in the testosterone group completed the 12-week treatment. Serum total and free testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels increased, and LH and FSH levels decreased in the testosterone-treated, but not in the placebo-treated, men. Lean body mass and fat-free mass, measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, increased significantly in men receiving testosterone patches [change in lean body mass, +1.345 +/- 0.533 kg (P = 0.02 compared to no change); change in fat-free mass, +1.364 +/- 0.525 kg (P = 0.02 compared to no change)], but did not change in the placebo group [change in lean body mass, 0.189 +/- 0.470 kg (P = NS compared to no change); change in fat-free mass, 0.186 +/- 0.470 kg (P = NS compared to no change)]. However, there was no significant difference between the 2 treatment groups in the change in lean body mass. The change in lean body mass during treatment was moderately correlated with the increment in serum testosterone levels (r = 0.41; P = 0.02). The testosterone-treated men experienced a greater decrease in fat mass than those receiving placebo patches (P = 0.04). There was no significant change in body weight in either treatment group. Changes in overall quality of life scores did not correlate with testosterone treatment; however, in the subcategory of role limitation due to emotional problems, the men in the testosterone group improved an average of 43 points of a 0-100 possible score, whereas those in the placebo group did not change. Red cell count increased in the testosterone group (change in red cell count, +0.1 +/- 0.1 10(12)/L) but decreased in the placebo group (change in red cell count, -0.2 +/- 0.1 10(12)/L). CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts and plasma HIV copy number did not significantly change during treatment. Serum prostate-specific antigen and plasma lipid levels did not change in either treatment group. Testosterone replacement in HIV-infected men with low testosterone levels is safe and is associated with a 1.35-kg gain in lean body mass, a significantly greater reduction in fat mass than that achieved with placebo treatment, an increased red cell count, and an improvement in role limitation due to emotional problems. Further studies are needed to assess whether testosterone supplementation can produce clinically meaningful changes in muscle function and disease outcome in HIV-infected men."
900,0.02,4.0000,"This paper presents the first of a three-phase study exploring the experiences of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Northern Thailand. The principal aim of the study was to gain an in-depth understanding of the factors contributing to adherence in patients taking highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). These insights were used in phase two to inform a number of interventions aimed at improving medication adherence in patients commencing HAART for the first time. The study comprised a cohort of 32 PLWHA over the age of 18 years who had taken HAART for at least three months. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used. The qualitative component used a multiple case study approach to explore and describe the experiences of patients receiving HAART. The quantitative component comprised the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale and a demographic survey of the respondents. This demographic data were used to provide descriptive statistics of the research population and assist with the interpretation of the qualitative data. The findings identified a number of social, clinical, and economic factors influencing adherence to HAART. These findings led to a number of recommendations that health care providers and policy-makers can implement to improve medication adherence rates in patients taking HAART. The findings demonstrated that improved adherence not only led to improved clinical outcomes, but also the overall quality of life of PLWHA."
17148,0.02,4.0000,"Previous studies have indicated that there is a significant prevalence (50%) of hypogonadism among men with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated wasting, and for these patients testosterone administration has been shown to increase lean body mass and improve quality of life. However, the prevalence of hypogonadism is not known among men with weight loss related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). From 1997 through 1999, we investigated total and free testosterone levels in 90 men who were <90% of ideal body weight or had weight loss of >10% from preillness weight; 71% of these subjects were receiving HAART. Twenty-one percent of the subjects receiving HAART had low free testosterone levels. No correlation was seen between weight, CD4 cell count, medication status, and other clinical factors. These data suggest that hypogonadism remains relatively common in men with AIDS wasting, despite treatment with HAART. HIV-infected men with wasting syndrome should be screened for hypogonadism and receive physiological androgen replacement therapy if they are hypogonadal."
9345,0.02,4.0000,"In December 2004, infection with a strain of multidrug-resistant (MDR), dual-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 was newly diagnosed in a man aged 46 years in New York City (NYC). The man (i.e., the index patient) had no history of antiretroviral treatment and reported having sex with multiple named and anonymous male partners, using crystal methamphetamine, and engaging in unprotected insertive and receptive anal intercourse. He had rapid progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) after experiencing signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection. The case was reported to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOH) in late January 2005 and has been described previously. This report describes the public health investigation of the index patient's reported contacts and a review of viral genetic sequencing (genotype) results from other HIV-infected patients in the NYC region to estimate the prevalence of this strain of HIV. The investigation, conducted by NYCDOH, Connecticut Department of Public Health, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, New York State Department of Health, and CDC, identified three other patients with similar risk factors who engaged in high-risk sexual activity at the same time and in the same venues as the index patient and who were infected with a genotypically homologous strain of HIV. The findings demonstrate the usefulness of population-based reporting of HIV genotyping data to identify exact matches of new HIV mutations associated with drug resistance and to determine their characteristics and public health importance. The findings also demonstrate the continued risk for HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) through high-risk behaviors and the need to find effective methods to prevent HIV transmission in this population."

17072,0.015,3.0000,"Sclerostin is linked to bone physiology and cardiovascular disease through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The goal of this study was to determine if sclerostin is related to bone physiology and cardiovascular disease during antiretroviral treatment in HIV-infected persons. This was a cross-sectional analysis from study entry into the Stopping Atherosclerosis and Treating Unhealthy bone with RosuvastatiN in HIV (SATURN) trial, an ongoing randomized trial comparing rosuvastatin to placebo in HIV-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy. Plasma sclerostin was measured at study entry by ELISA from participants with available samples. Spearman correlation and multivariable linear regression were used to test relationships between sclerostin and bone density or bone turnover and cardiovascular disease. Among 139 HIV-infected participants (median age 46 years, CD4 lymphocyte count 614 cells/μl), the median plasma sclerostin level was 444.1 (IQR 330.3, 570.1) pg/ml. Correlations were detected between sclerostin and age (r=0.26), lumbar spine Z-score (r=0.31), RANKL (r=-0.21), carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT, r=0.19), and sVCAM-1 (r=0.27), p<0.05. No significant correlations were detected between sclerostin and current (r=0.006) or nadir CD4 count (r=0.11). While associations between sclerostin, lumbar spine Z-score, and sVCAM-1 were robust to covariate adjustment (p<0.01), association with CIMT was no longer significant (p=0.08). Our findings provide preliminary support for a relationship between sclerostin and bone mineral density in HIV-infected persons. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway should be investigated as a potential mechanism for loss of bone mineral density in treated HIV infection. "
10196,0.015,3.0000,"Knowledge of an HIV-infected individual's sexual behaviors and routine sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) testing greatly facilitates HIV prevention efforts, but current data in older individuals are lacking. This study was developed to compare sexual behaviors and STD prevalence between older HIV-infected individuals and their younger counterparts. We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study of HIV-infected individuals > or =18 years who completed an annual behavioral assessment. A total of 541 individuals completed the assessment. Analyses were performed to examine differences in sexual behaviors and STD prevalence between age groups: younger (18-35 years) (30%), middle-aged (36-49 years) (46%), and older (> or =50 years) (24%). Older individuals were most likely to be male and Caucasian with longest time since HIV diagnosis, greatest receipt of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and highest rates of HIV RNA <50 copies/mL (all p<0.001). Reports of recent sexual activity decreased with age, younger (56%) vs. middle-aged (43%) vs. older (27%) (p<0.001). The median number of recent sex partners was one (range 1-25) and 68% overall reported using condoms consistently; these parameters did not differ by age group. STD prevalence was 8% (gonorrhea [9], chlamydia [7], and syphilis [20]) and was highest among younger individuals (younger [11%] vs. middle-aged [7%] vs. older [3%]). Our results demonstrated that with older age, sexual activity declines but inconsistent condom use remains commonly reported. Furthermore, STDs were identified among all age groups. This latter finding reinforces the need for secondary prevention efforts among all individuals living with HIV/AIDS."
13747,0.015,3.0000,"The availability of potent antiretroviral medications has raised new concerns regarding continued HIV transmission risk behavior among seropositive persons. Relatively little is known about how women with HIV perceive secondary transmission risk in the context of HIV treatment advances. This study describes sexual risk perceptions and behaviors of 80 women enrolled in HIV outpatient care in 1999. Participants completed structured interviews assessing sexual risk perceptions, attitudes regarding severity of HIV disease, sources of HIV prevention information, and sexual practices during the previous 6 months. Medical histories including 6-month cumulative incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were obtained from a clinic database. Thirty-five percent of the sample had engaged in unprotected intercourse or had been diagnosed with an STD in the past 6 months. Only 5% of women believed that medication-related reductions in viral load signify safer sex is unimportant, but 15% indicated they practice safer sex less often since the advent of new HIV treatments and 40% believed AIDS is now a less serious threat. These data suggest women's perceptions of diminished disease severity may be more influential than beliefs regarding diminished infectivity. Study results have implications for framing prevention messages for women and suggest that close integration of secondary prevention and clinical HIV services may be beneficial."
18278,0.015,3.0000,"Adequate adherence to anti-retroviral therapy is required to achieve viral suppression and desirable treatment outcomes among HIV patients. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between adherence and severity of substance use as well as adherence and severity of depressive symptoms among Iranian HIV patients. In a prospective study, HIV patients with current substance use were assessed for adherence level via self report and pill count methods, severity of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory- II) and substance use (Addiction Severity Index) during a three months follow up after initiating antiretroviral therapy. The adherence level, severity of depressive symptoms and substance use were assessed one month, two months and three months after initiation of anti-retroviral therapy. Addiction Severity Index (ASI) composite scores were calculated for each domain and the associations between ASI domains and adherence as well as severity of depressive symptoms and adherence were assessed. Twenty six HIV patients with current substance use disorder completed the study. At the end of the first month, adherence to therapy via pill count and self-report were 80%±31.9% and 85.12%±32%, respectively. At the end of the second month, adherence to therapy via pill count and self report were 87%±32% and 93.94%±23% respectively. At the end of the third month, the measured adherence via pill count and self report were 85%±33.7% and 90.1%±25.7% respectively. Adherence was higher among married patients and those who used reminder systems. Composite scores of the medical status and psychiatric status were related to higher adherence after first month. Substance use was inversely associated with adherence at the second follow up (r=-0.4, p=0.04). Also, severity of depressive symptoms was not related to adherence level. The repeated measurement analysis showed a significant decrease in psychiatric status domain of the ASI composite score after three months of initiating therapy (p=0.02). Preventive measures should aim treatment of substance use among HIV patients in order to increase adherence level. Also, conducting psychological evaluations is necessary considering the high prevalence of depression among Iranian HIV patients. "
2080,0.015,3.0000,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been associated with primary central nervous system lymphoma and other EBV-related malignancies in HIV infected patients, and detection of EBV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been demonstrated to be a good marker of PCNSL. Conversely, EBV has been rarely associated with encephalitis in HIV patients. Here we describe for the first time the case of an HIV-infected, late presenter Caucasian man, diagnosed with a rapidly progressive diffuse encephalitis at presentation. A very high viral load for EBV was detected in CSF by PCR. The patient died 12 days after the onset of encephalitis in spite of supportive, antiviral and antiretroviral therapy. Our experience would suggest that in profoundly immunosuppressed HIV patients EBV may cause severe encephalitis in the absence of lymphoproliferative disorders."
3557,0.015,3.0000,"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and their sequelae are responsible for significant human and economic costs. Military personnel are one of many core populations at increased risk for acquiring STDs. This study was designed to assess primary care physician/practitioner compliance with secondary screening recommendations and reporting practices of STDs in a military setting. Data from approximately 27,000 covered lives from the Naval Hospital and the Naval Air Station Branch Medical Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, were used in this analysis. Because chlamydia is the most prevalent STD, laboratory results indicative of infection with chlamydia from July 1 to December 31, 1996, were used as a marker of a patient population requiring additional (secondary) STD screening. Patients with laboratory-confirmed chlamydia infection were identified using the Composite Health Care System. The medical records of these index cases were then analyzed for the presence of laboratory test results of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), rapid plasma reagin, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) within 6 months of a positive chlamydia test. To assess compliance with mandated reporting of particular STDs, total laboratory-confirmed cases of chlamydia, syphilis, and HBV were compared with total cases reported to the Office of Preventive Medicine at the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, U.S. Navy, during a 1-year period from July 1, 1996, to June 30, 1997. In 32% of chlamydia cases, no additional laboratory tests for HIV, syphilis, or HBV were obtained within 6 months. Fourteen percent of chlamydia cases were reported to the Office of preventive Medicine. Compliance with screening for multiple STDs after the identification of a single STD should be improved. In addition, better methods for reporting cases of STDs should be implemented."
2823,0.015,3.0000,"Antiretroviral (ARV) adherence has largely been considered from the perspective of an individual's behavior with less attention given to potential structural causes for lapses in treatment, such as the cost of medications and care. HIV medication expense is typically covered by third party payers. However, private insurance premiums and deductibles may rise, or policies terminated such as with a change in employment. Likewise, a patient's eligibility for publicly funded coverage like state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP) or Medicaid can also be lost. We conducted a one-time survey of a sample of 300 patients receiving HIV care at a single large academic center in the south of United States to examine lapses in HIV therapy due to financial reasons. We found that during the prior year, financial issues including medication cost or coverage led to a lapse in ARVs in 10% (n = 31) of participants. However, of the 42% (n = 125) participants who had been enrolled in ADAP at any time during the prior year, 21% (n = 26) reported an ARV lapse due to problems with ADAP or medication cost. Respondents cited ADAP's required semi-annual renewal process and other administrative issues as the cause of ARV lapses. The median duration of missed ARVs was 2 weeks (range of <1-23 weeks). Non-HIV medication and transportation to and from clinic costs were also identified as financial burdens to care by respondents. In conclusion, although conducted at a single medical center and one state, this study suggests that a significant minority of HIV-infected patients encounter financial barriers to ARV access, and this is paradoxically more common among those enrolled in the state ADAP. Streamlining, supporting, and simplifying ADAP renewal procedures will likely reduce lapses in ARV adherence and persistence."
2616,0.015,3.0000,"We describe a 61-year-old man presenting with necrotizing myopathy associated with chronic active hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Thirteen patients with HCV-associated myopathy have been reported previously. In most of these cases, varying degrees of inflammatory changes were observed in the muscle tissue. In 2 patients, myopathy developed after initiation of interferon therapy for chronic HCV hepatitis. Our case was unusual due to long-standing elevation of creatine kinase values which improved following interferon therapy and the non-inflammatory features of the muscle tissue where the HCV RNA minus strand, a marker for replicative intermediates of the virus, was undetectable. The association of myopathy with HCV infection might represent a unique clinical entity, although the underlying pathological mechanisms remain unknown."
11559,0.015,3.0000,"Weight loss and muscle wasting remain significant clinical problems, even in the era of potent antiretroviral therapy. In patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), wasting, particularly loss of metabolically active lean tissue, has been associated with increased mortality, accelerated disease progression, loss of muscle protein mass, and impairment of strength and functional status. Factors that may contribute to wasting include inadequate intake, malabsorptive disorders, metabolic alterations, hypogonadism, and excessive cytokine production. Evidence now demonstrates that nutritional counseling and support, appetite stimulants, progressive resistance training, and anabolic hormones can reverse weight loss and increase lean body mass in HIV-infected patients. Despite a growing body of evidence on the importance of nutritional intervention to prevent wasting in adults, maintain growth velocity in children, and promote restoration of weight and lean body mass in stable, low-weight patients, no therapeutic guidelines currently exist for the management of weight loss and wasting in HIV-infected patients. Principles and guidelines for assessment and management of weight loss and wasting in patients with HIV/AIDS are presented."
4134,0.015,3.0000,"The success of combination antiretroviral therapy is limited by the evolutionary escape dynamics of HIV-1. We used Isotonic Conjunctive Bayesian Networks (I-CBNs), a class of probabilistic graphical models, to describe this process. We employed partial order constraints among viral resistance mutations, which give rise to a limited set of mutational pathways, and we modeled phenotypic drug resistance as monotonically increasing along any escape pathway. Using this model, the individualized genetic barrier (IGB) to each drug is derived as the probability of the virus not acquiring additional mutations that confer resistance. Drug-specific IGBs were combined to obtain the IGB to an entire regimen, which quantifies the virus' genetic potential for developing drug resistance under combination therapy. The IGB was tested as a predictor of therapeutic outcome using between 2,185 and 2,631 treatment change episodes of subtype B infected patients from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study Database, a large observational cohort. Using logistic regression, significant univariate predictors included most of the 18 drugs and single-drug IGBs, the IGB to the entire regimen, the expert rules-based genotypic susceptibility score (GSS), several individual mutations, and the peak viral load before treatment change. In the multivariate analysis, the only genotype-derived variables that remained significantly associated with virological success were GSS and, with 10-fold stronger association, IGB to regimen. When predicting suppression of viral load below 400 cps/ml, IGB outperformed GSS and also improved GSS-containing predictors significantly, but the difference was not significant for suppression below 50 cps/ml. Thus, the IGB to regimen is a novel data-derived predictor of treatment outcome that has potential to improve the interpretation of genotypic drug resistance tests. "
8124,0.015,3.0000,"It has been suggested that naive immunoglobulins encoded by the V(H)3 gene family interact aberrantly with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 via a superantigenic epitope, causing initial expansion and eventual depletion of V(H)3-expressing B cells. However, this possibility has not been prospectively assessed during an AIDS virus infection. We determined V(H) family usage in rhesus monkeys during primary infection with chimeric viruses expressing HIV-1 envelopes on a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) backbone (SHIVs). Four SHIVs with different envelopes and pathogenicities were studied. V(H) family usage was prospectively assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymph node cells of these monkeys by a semiquantitative PCR technique. In the first months following SHIV infection, a period of intense viral antigenemia, representation of various V(H) families increased or decreased for individual monkeys, but no single V(H) family was consistently altered. In particular, the average representation of V(H)3-bearing B lymphocytes did not change. This observation suggests that the envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 does not selectively expand or deplete the V(H)3 repertoire of primate B cells during acute AIDS virus infection, contrary to predictions of the gp120 superantigen hypothesis."
5544,0.015,3.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted disease (STD)-related risks in peacekeeping troops is a concern when they are stationed in areas of high HIV prevalence. We carried out an assessment of a situationally focused individual HIV/STD reduction intervention (where avoidance of risk situations, as well as risk behaviors, are emphasized) in one Nigerian military unit (N = 1,222), with a comparable unit from the same service as a waiting list control (N = 987). The intervention consisted of a possible five modules that were presented to groups of up to 50 personnel. Data were collected on reported sexual behaviors, condom beliefs, sexual risk behaviors with casual partners, and number of interventions attended. Data indicated significant increases in reported condom use with casual partners and positive condom beliefs at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Risk behavior was reduced 30% from baseline at 6 months and 23% from baseline at 12 months. There was also a significant dose-response effect for number of interventions attended. These data suggest that relatively brief situationally focused individual interventions are effective in military and West African contexts in reducing HIV/STD risk behaviors."
15115,0.015,3.0000,"Three single-session preventive interventions for reducing sexually transmitted disease (STD) and human immunodeficiency virus infection risk behaviors were evaluated with a sample of 400 men who attended a large military STD clinic. A quasi-experimental, pre-evaluation/postevaluation design was used, comparing standard clinic care alone versus standard care combined with 1 of 3 experimental interventions: health-risk appraisal, interactive video, and targeted situational behaviors. Questionnaire data were collected at baseline and during follow-up visits at 2 weeks and 2 months. Findings indicated that the health-risk appraisal and interactive video increased adherence with clinic recommendations to abstain from sex (chi(2)3199=19.67; P<.001) and increased readiness to change ""risky"" partner-selection behavior (chi(2)2194=6.42; P<.04). Follow-up data suggested that STD-related risk behavior was particularly resistant to change but that the single-session intervention had some impact, which could be viewed as a ""priming"" effect that enhances multisession interventions."
12837,0.015,3.0000,"We evaluated the association of the number of late antiretroviral therapy (ART) refills with patient outcomes in a large public-sector human immunodeficiency virus treatment program in Lusaka, Zambia. Using pharmacy data routinely collected during 2004-2010, we calculated the number of late refills during the initial year of ART. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression to examine the association between the number of late refills and death or program failure (i.e., death, loss to follow-up, or program withdrawal) >12 months after ART initiation, with and without stratification by the medication possession ratio (MPR) during the initial year of ART. Of 53,015 adults who received ART for ≥12 months (median follow-up duration, 86.1 months; interquartile range, 53.2-128.2 months), 26,847 (50.6%) had 0 late refills, 16,762 (31.6%) had 1, 6,505 (12.3%) had 2, and 2,901 (5.5%) had ≥3. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that ≥3 late refills was associated with a greater mortality risk than 1 and 2 late refills (p<0.001, by the log-rank test). The mortality risk was greater for patients with 2 late refills [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99-1.38] or ≥3 late refills (adjusted HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.23-1.87), compared with that for patients with 0-1 late refills. Program failure was associated with ≥2 late refills. An MPR of <80% was associated with similar increases in mortality risk across late-refill strata. Monitoring late refills during the initial period of ART may help resource- and time-constrained clinics identify patients at risk for program failure."
6292,0.015,3.0000,"In Vietnam, premature mortality due to AIDS-related conditions is commonly associated with late initiation to antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study explores reasons for late ART initiation among people living with HIV (PLHIV) from the perspectives of health care providers and PLHIV. The study was undertaken in six clinics from five provinces in Vietnam. Baseline CD4 counts were collected from patient records and grouped into three categories: very late initiators (≤100 cells/mm(3) CD4), late initiators (100-200 cells/mm(3)) and timely initiators (200-350 cells/mm(3)). Thirty in-depth interviews with patients who started ART and 15 focus group discussions with HIV service providers were conducted and thematic analysis of the content performed. Of 934 patients, 62% started ART very late and 11% initiated timely treatment. The proportion of patients for whom a CD4 count was obtained within six months of their HIV diagnosis ranged from 22% to 72%. The proportion of patients referred to ART clinics by voluntary testing and counselling centres ranged from 1% to 35%. Structural barriers to timely ART initiation were poor linkage between HIV testing and HIV care and treatment services, lack of patient confidentiality and a shortage of HIV/AIDS specialists. If Vietnam's treatment practice is to align with WHO recommendations then the connection between voluntary counselling and testing service and ART clinics must be improved. Expansion and decentralization of HIV/AIDS services to allow implementation at the community level increased task sharing between doctors and nurses to overcome limited human resources, and improved patient confidentiality are likely to increase timely access to HIV treatment services for more patients."
1797,0.015,3.0000,"The primary objective of this study was to gain a clearer understanding of the barriers to adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) faced by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHIV/AIDS) on Long Island, New York. Focus group, a qualitative research method, was used to study these barriers. The study was conducted in 1998 on Long Island, NY, at five institutions that provide services to 1700 PLWHIV/AIDS. Five focus groups were conducted with 6 to 13 PLWHIV/AIDS in each group, a total of 39 subjects. PLWHIV/AIDS identified eight common barriers to adherence to HAART. In descending order, the barriers include: (1) frequency and severity of side effects, (2) conflicts with daily routines, (3) dietary requirements, (4) frequency of taking medications, (5) number and dosage of medications, (6) psychosocial factors (i.e., stress, feeling good, and bad news), (7) pharmacy refills, and (8) physiological needs (i.e., sleep, hunger, or thirst). Many factors play a role in the success or failure of HAART, including preexisting drug resistance, drug-drug interactions, and the ability of PLWHIV/AIDS to adhere to a rigid and frequently changing medication regimen. The information gleaned from focus groups is limited in that it may not be generalized to a larger population with any known reliability. However, clinicians sensitive to barriers to adherence to HAART, including those identified by PLWHIV/AIDS in this study, may play a more proactive role in supporting adherence to the medication regimen, increasing the durability of effective viral suppression, decreasing morbidity and mortality, and decreasing the selection and transmission of resistant strains of HIV."
19512,0.015,3.0000,"Although adherence is an important key to the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy (ART), many people living with HIV (PLWH) fail to maintain optimal levels of ART adherence over time. PLWH with the added burden of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection possess unique challenges that potentially impact their motivation and ability to adhere to ART. The present investigation sought to (1) compare ART adherence levels among a sample of HIV/HCV-coinfected versus HIV-monoinfected patients, and (2) identify whether ART-related clinical and psychosocial correlates differ by HCV status. PLWH receiving ART (N = 215: 105 HIV/HCV-coinfected, 110 HIV-monoinfected) completed a comprehensive survey assessing ART adherence and its potential correlates. Medical chart extraction identified clinical factors, including liver enzymes. Results demonstrated that ART adherence did not differ by HCV status, with 83.7% of coinfected patients and 82.4% of monoinfected patients reporting optimal (i.e., ≥95%) adherence during a four-day recall period (p = .809). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that regardless of HCV status, optimal ART adherence was associated with experiencing fewer adherence-related behavioral skills barriers (AOR = 0.56; 95%CI = 0.43-0.73), lower likelihood of problematic drinking (AOR = 0.15; 95%CI = 0.04-0.67), and lower likelihood of methamphetamine use (AOR = 0.14; 95%CI = 0.03-0.69). However, among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, optimal adherence was additionally associated with experiencing fewer ART adherence-related motivational barriers (AOR = 0.23; 95%CI = 0.08-0.62) and lower likelihood of depression (AOR = 0.06; 95%CI = 0.00-0.84). Findings suggest that although HIV/HCV-coinfected patients may face additional, distinct barriers to ART adherence, levels of adherence commensurate with those demonstrated by HIV-monoinfected patients might be achievable if these barriers are addressed."
7013,0.015,3.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a controversial indication for liver transplantation (LT) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients because of reportedly poor outcomes. This prospective, multicenter US cohort study compared patient and graft survival for 89 HCV/HIV-coinfected patients and 2 control groups: 235 HCV-monoinfected LT controls and all US transplant recipients who were 65 years old or older. The 3-year patient and graft survival rates were 60% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 47%-71%] and 53% (95% CI = 40%-64%) for the HCV/HIV patients and 79% (95% CI = 72%-84%) and 74% (95% CI = 66%-79%) for the HCV-infected recipients (P < 0.001 for both), and HIV infection was the only factor significantly associated with reduced patient and graft survival. Among the HCV/HIV patients, older donor age [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.3 per decade], combined kidney-liver transplantation (HR = 3.8), an anti-HCV-positive donor (HR = 2.5), and a body mass index < 21 kg/m(2) (HR = 3.2) were independent predictors of graft loss. For the patients without the last 3 factors, the patient and graft survival rates were similar to those for US LT recipients. The 3-year incidence of treated acute rejection was 1.6-fold higher for the HCV/HIV patients versus the HCV patients (39% versus 24%, log rank P = 0.02), but the cumulative rates of severe HCV disease at 3 years were not significantly different (29% versus 23%, P = 0.21). In conclusion, patient and graft survival rates are lower for HCV/HIV-coinfected LT patients versus HCV-monoinfected LT patients. Importantly, the rates of treated acute rejection (but not the rates of HCV disease severity) are significantly higher for HCV/HIV-coinfected recipients versus HCV-infected recipients. Our results indicate that HCV per se is not a contraindication to LT in HIV patients, but recipient and donor selection and the management of acute rejection strongly influence outcomes."

To investigate the association between sputum smear status at presentation and local pulmonary immune responses in HIV-infected patients with pulmonary TB, we compared the cellular and cytokine profiles in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from the site of lung disease in 22 sputum smear- and culture-positive, and 17 sputum smear-negative but culture-positive pulmonary TB patients. Smear-positive patients had significantly higher BAL fluid concentrations of IL-6 (p=0.007), IL-8 (p=0.02), IL-10 (p=0.03) and IFN-gamma (p=0.008) than smear-negative patients. No significant differences in the proportions of examined BAL cells were found. We concluded that sputum smear-positive TB was associated with greater pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokine responses at the site of lung disease than sputum smear-negative disease. The local immune responses may affect the clinical presentation of active pulmonary TB in HIV-infected patients."

Serum rapid plasma reagin was 1:64, and fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (FTA-ABS) was 4+. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid showed a mononuclear pleocytosis and reactive FTA-ABS. The myelopathy responded promptly to high-dose intravenous aqueous penicillin. Syphilis needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient who develops a myelopathy in association with HIV-1 infection. Because of the diverse nature in which syphilis may affect the spinal cord, treatment with intravenous aqueous penicillin, 12 to 24 million units daily, for a minimum of 10 days, should be considered in any HIV-1-seropositive patient with a progressive, unexplained myelopathy and positive serologic studies for syphilis."

Prospective analysis of weight change was performed in 30 male subjects with stage IV HIV infection over a period of 9-49 mo and weight change events (> 4 kg) related to contemporaneous clinical events. Two distinct patterns of weight loss were observed: episodes of acute severe weight loss and episodes of chronic unremitting progressive weight loss. Thirty-three acute episodes (median 9.1 kg in 1.7 mo) and 23 chronic episodes (13.2 kg in 9.5 mo) were identified. Twenty-seven of 33 (82%) acute weight-loss episodes were associated with nongastrointestinal opportunistic infections and 15 of 23 (65%) chronic episodes with gastrointestinal disease (P < 0.01). Weight loss was neither inevitable nor unremitting. Periods of weight stability (> 4 mo) occurred in 13 individuals (43%); 35 episodes of weight gain were identified, mostly related to recovery from opportunistic infection. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the natural history of weight loss in HIV infection."

The subjects were currently active IDUs from a wide spectrum of age, sex, sexual orientation, geographical location and social background, contacted and recruited through their social networks and from community agencies and prisons by trained peer workers who interviewed and collected blood from them in the field. Sera were tested for antibody to HIV, HCV and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and for HCV RNA using reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At entry to the study, 4.5% (14/311) had antibody to HIV, 47% (146/308) to HBcAg and 68% (206/303) to HCV. Prevalence of HBsAg was 1.8% overall (5/282), and 50% (84/168) were positive for HCV RNA. By multivariate analysis, HIV seropositivity was strongly associated with a history of homosexual contact in males and with exposure to HBV but not to HCV.

2287,0.015,3.0000,"Drug injection and other practices affecting the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were studied among 154 heroin users and 45 methamphetamine users in San Antonio, Texas. Amphetamine users were younger, mostly white, and had less-severe drug dependence. Heroin users had significantly higher levels of needle risk, as indicated by frequency of injection, number of persons sharing equipment, and place of injection. Methamphetamine users tended to buy syringes in lots of 10 or more from pharmacies and to use a syringe less than 5 times before discarding it. Heroin users tended to buy 1 needle at a time from an illicit source and to use it more than 20 times. Of methamphetamine users, 71% had more than one sex partner, compared to 39% of heroin users. Partners of methamphetamine users were more likely to be drug injectors than were partners of heroin users. Fewer methamphetamine users reported a behavior change in response to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, and fewer had been contacted by AIDS Education/Outreach. We suggest that efforts to promote risk reduction among methamphetamine users be stepped up because this population has been underserved and because less-sweeping behavior changes are needed to reduce needle-related risks to acceptable levels."
17493,0.015,3.0000,"Fifty consecutive patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were evaluated regarding the prevalence of HIV-related myopathies and the relevance of zidovudine-related mitochondrial myopathy. Disease stage, total lifetime intake of zidovudine, anthropometric and nutritional parameters, muscle strength, and histochemical and immunohistochemical findings in muscle specimens were recorded. The series was divided into two groups, patients with a total lifetime intake of zidovudine under 200 gm and those with a total lifetime intake over 200 gm. A control group included 50 healthy people matched for age and sex. HIV-related myopathy was defined by the presence of at least one of the classic pathological reactions in muscle, while zidovudine-related myopathy was defined by the presence of ragged red fibers in any percentage. Lower values of the nutritional parameters were detected in the HIV cohort, when compared with normal control values. HIV-related myopathy was detected in 13 (26%) of the 50 patients. There were no differences between groups except for the development of mitochondrial myopathy that occurred in 1 of the 26 patients in Group 1 and in 16 of the 24 in Group II. Six patients who had a total intake of more than 200 gm of zidovudine and demonstrated red ragged fibers in their muscle specimens were absolutely asymptomatic. There was a positive correlation between total intake of zidovudine and the percentage of red ragged fibers in muscle biopsy specimens."
498,0.015,3.0000,"From December 1988 to April 1989, 154 female prostitutes in and around Ghent, Belgium, were interviewed about their knowledge, attitudes and practices in relation to the risks for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in their profession. Thirty four women worked as window prostitutes, 120 picked up their clients in bars, clubs, and saunas. Blood samples were taken from 123 women. One (0.8%) was seropositive for HIV1, 19 (15.4%) had Hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc), eight (6.4%) showed markers of syphilis. None of them were Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. Hepatitis C antibodies (anti-HCV) were present in the serum of three women (2.4%). Overall STD seroprevalence was higher in the group of window prostitutes than in the group of club prostitutes. One woman admitted intravenous drug use. Former testing for anti-HIV antibodies had been performed in 102 (66.5%) respondents, of whom 84 (82.3%) were tested in the year preceding the interview. In 74.5% of the cases, these tests were requested by the women themselves. These results suggest that HIV infection is not yet prevalent in non-intravenous drug using prostitutes in Ghent, but that this situation may change considering their higher rates of past STD. Window prostitutes are at higher risk than club prostitutes. Testing for HIV seems to be common practice, mostly at the request of the women themselves. Health education should discourage the notion of testing as an alternative to using condoms."
19514,0.015,3.0000,"Female crack cocaine users are at high risk for HIV infection. Data from 121 female substance abusers admitted to an all-female rehabilitation center in Trinidad and Tobago between 1996 and 2002 were reviewed retrospectively to determine human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence and associated risk factors. HIV seroprevalence was 19.8%, which is six times higher than in the general population. The univariate analysis identified the following factors associated with HIV infection: poor educational attainment, history of a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and use of crack cocaine. In the multivariate analysis, only poor educational attainment and history of an STI were independently associated with HIV seroprevalence. Female substance abusers, especially female crack cocaine users, are at high risk of acquiring and transmitting the HIV virus. To reduce risk of HIV infection, rehabilitation programs should address risky sexual behaviors and screen for STIs, and they also should improve educational attainment, develop skills, and provide vocational training."
5786,0.015,3.0000,"The gastrointestinal manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 disease have centered on identifiable causes of intestinal dysfunction such as parasitic and bacterial pathogens. The lamina propria of the intestine contains cell that harbor HIV-1, but the significance of this observation remains unknown. Because limited animal models are available to evaluate the gastrointestinal effects of this infection, a system that uses human fetal intestine transplanted subcutaneously onto the back of an immunodeficient mouse was developed. After 8 weeks, fetal tissues mature into an adult-appearing tissue with a lumen. Cell-free HIV-1 was inoculated into the explants, an evidence for infection was evaluated by histological evaluation, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction. No evidence for HIV-1 incorporation into epithelial cells could be found. It was concluded that this model provides a system in which intestinal HIV-1 interaction can be evaluated. In this model, cell-free HIV-1 does not appear to infect the epithelial cell."
16715,0.015,3.0000,"Fifty-seven ambulatory, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients at various stages of disease progression and 17 HIV seronegative controls were examined in a cross-sectional study with self-administered measures of emotional distress, coping, and adjustment to illness. All infected and control subjects were homosexual or bisexual and free of acute medical illness. The findings indicated that both uninfected and infected subjects had enhanced emotional distress in a variety of domains. However, while somatic and cognitive-ruminative complaints were greater in symptomatic subjects relative to controls, depression and anxiety were not. Professed coping strategies were heterogeneous and not particularly related to HIV diagnostic status, with the exception of planful problem solving which was decreased for acquired immune deficiency syndrome subjects. Disruption in several aspects of daily life adjustment was markedly increased in symptomatic subjects. The findings suggest that both HIV seropositive status and perceived risk for infection produce a sustained level of generalized psychological distress. Even in the absence of current medical illness, patients with advanced disease progression are concerned primarily with anticipated medical implications and cognitive effectiveness."
453,0.015,3.0000,"Policy-makers and clinicians are faced with a gap of evidence to guide policy on standards for HIV outpatient care. Ongoing debates include which settings of care improve health outcomes, and how many HIV-infected patients a health-care provider should treat to gain and maintain expertise. In this article, we evaluate the studies that link health-care facility and care provider characteristics (i.e., structural factors) to health outcomes in HIV-infected patients. We searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, PUBMED, and EMBASE from inception until 1 January 2015. We included a total of 28 observational studies that were conducted after the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy in 1996. Three aspects of the available research linking the structure to quality of HIV outpatient care were evaluated: (1) assessed structural characteristics (i.e., health-care facility and care provider characteristics); (2) measures of quality of HIV outpatient care; and (3) reported associations between structural characteristics and quality of care. Rather than scarcity of data, it is the diversity in methodology in the identified studies and the inconsistency of their results that led us to the conclusion that the scientific evidence is too weak to guide policy in HIV outpatient care. We provide recommendations on how to address this heterogeneity in future studies and offer specific suggestions for further reading that could be of interest for clinicians and researchers."
15156,0.01,2.0000,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of three variables--protease inhibitors, stavudine, and the length of combined therapy--on body habitus changes, metabolic effects and bone mineral density in HIV patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The onset of possible cardiovascular involvement was considered. Forty HIV patients (29 men and 11 women, mean age 39.13 +/- 7.82 years, range 28-61 years) treated with HAART for 12-43 months were evaluated for fat, lean, bone tissues, immunohematological and cardiovascular alterations. The differences in fat/lean tissues and bone mineral density were evaluated at dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Serum lipids and the CD4/CD8 T-cell counts were recorded. ECGs were taken every 6 months; color Doppler echocardiography and color Doppler ultrasounds of the carotid vessels were performed in close chronological sequence with the second DEXA. Statistical analyses included: Student's t-test, Wilcoxon test, and single-multiple regression analysis. Thirteen patients presented with fat loss, 7 fat accumulation, and 20 a combined form of both. The changes in the single body districts showed that the decrease in the limb fat is to be attributed to protease inhibitors, while none of the three variables was responsible for the decrease in the upper limb fat. The trunk weight increase was not significant. The decrease in the lean mass of the upper limbs is to be attributed to protease inhibitors, while none of the three variables was responsible for the increase in the lean mass of the upper and lower limbs. The decrease in bone mineral density was not significant. No treatment-related cardiovascular lesions were observed. In HIV patients treated with HAART for 12-43 months, the decrease in lower limb fat was due to protease inhibitors. Neither osteopenia nor cardiovascular diseases were observed during follow-up."
2425,0.01,2.0000,"Appropriate supportive care and identification of long-term sequels of therapy are of paramount importance in HIV-infected pediatric patients. As low bone mineral quality (BMQ) in patients can be considered a marker of possible degeneration in osteopenia and osteoporosis in adulthood, we evaluated bone features in a pediatric population. Forty-four patients (23 females, 21 males; aged 3-17 years) were compared with a control population (1227 healthy children: 568 females, 641 males; aged 3-18 years). Seven patients were CDC stage C, 18 B, and 18 A. All patients were vertically infected; four were naive to any antiretroviral treatment, seven were taking two NRTIs, and 32 were on HAART. BMQ was assessed by a quantitative ultrasound (QUS) technique. It measures the amplitude-dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS, m/sec) and the bone transmission time (BTT, microsec). QUS values were significantly lower in cases than in controls, even after adjustment for age and body size (AD-SoS: 1924.7 +/- 64.9 and BTT: 0.97 +/- 0.3 in controls; AD-SoS: 1879.7 +/- 57.2 and BTT: 0.80 +/- 0.32 in cases; p < or = 0.001). The associations of AD-SoS and BTT with gender, type of therapy, and CDC stages were not significant. AD-SoS and BTT were significantly associated with age (r = 0.59, p < 0.0001), skeletal age SDS (r = 0.46, p = 0.002), height (r = 0.66, p < 0.0001), and therapy duration (r = 0.31, p = 0.04). Both AD-SoS and BTT values in patients fell below mean values of controls. Follow-up of bone mineral density is important in patients to prevent long-term problems of skeletal status."
9015,0.01,2.0000,"To determine the true incidence of abnormalities in bone marrow specimens from patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the clinical significance of these abnormalities regarding their cause and their role in the production of hematologic complications, 216 bone marrow biopsies, aspirates, and/or imprint preparations from 178 patients who either were seropositive for HIV infection or met the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were studied. Detailed morphologic review was performed in a blind fashion as to clinical status. Extensive clinical, therapeutic, and laboratory data were collected for each patient. Statistical analysis was performed to detect significant correlations between morphologic findings and clinical/therapeutic/laboratory features. Among the most common bone marrow findings were hypercellularity (53% of specimens), myelodysplasia (69%), evidence of reticuloendothelial (RE) iron blockade (65%), megaloblastic hematopoiesis (38%), fibrosis (20%), plasmacytosis (25%), lymphocytic aggregates (36%), and granulomas (13%). A number of statistically significant correlations between morphologic findings and clinical features were noted. No significant association was detected between any morphologic finding and therapy with a variety of drugs. In 7 of 14 (50%) patients found to have marrow involvement by malignant neoplasm, the bone marrow represented the initial site of diagnosis of the neoplasm. Most of the bone marrow abnormalities associated with HIV infection appear to be related directly to the infection or its complications and not to therapeutic intervention. In certain clinical situations, bone marrow examination continues to be useful in the management of patients infected with HIV."
12255,0.01,2.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been shown to have a beneficial effect on several opportunistic and other coinfections of HIV infected individuals. The effect of HAART on HCV coinfections is controversial. We describe the case of a patient, in whom a close temporal relationship between changes in HIV viremia, HCV viremia and ALT levels was observed. Longterm suppression of HIV replication by HAART was associated with a normalization of ALT levels and finally clearance of the HCV infection. Our data suggest that improved immune functions due to reductions of the HIV load led to a better control and finally resolution of the HCV infection in this patient."
9415,0.01,2.0000,"We report the use of efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg, once daily in a 47-year-old black man with a solitary kidney and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1990, he underwent radiation, chemotherapy, and ultimately, a unilateral nephrectomy for Wilms' tumor. Because of previous reports of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-induced nephrotoxicity, our objective was to evaluate and monitor our patient's renal function over the course of 19 months based on serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance using the Cockroft-Gault equation, estimated glomerular filtration rate using the modification of diet in renal disease formula and urinalyses. After experiencing gastrointestinal side effects from other antiretroviral agents, our patient was switched to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in June 2013. At baseline, his serum creatinine was 1.35 mg/dL, estimated creatinine clearance 68.7 mL/min (based on actual body weight of 71.8 kg), estimated glomerular filtration rate 72.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2), with a CD4 cell count of 119 cells/mm(3) (5%) and an undetectable HIV viral load. In March 2015, his weight was 73.2 kg, serum creatinine 1.42 mg/dL, estimated creatinine clearance 65.2 mL/min, estimated glomerular filtration rate 68.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2), with a CD4 cell count of 120 cells/mm(3) (10%) and an undetectable HIV viral load. Other authors have reported tenofovir-induced nephrotoxicity in patients with a solitary kidney. Our patient had no evidence of nephrotoxicity over the course of 19 months on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based antiretroviral therapy (ART). He maintained adequate renal function, comparable to his baseline renal function. Our case report suggests that a tenofovir disoproxil fumurate-based ART may be a viable option for some patients with a solitary kidney. Additional studies and data are needed considering this is a small and relatively unstudied population."
7925,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity has historically been an absolute contraindication for solid organ transplantation. However, the successful application of HAART (highly active anti-retroviral therapy) drug regimens has greatly prolonged the life expectancy of HIV-positive patients. Therefore, it has become appropriate to consider this patient population for transplantation. HIV positive transplants are being performed around the country in controlled settings, usually as part of a research protocol. The aim of our study is to describe the Louisiana experience with organ transplantation into HIV-positive patients. We identified seven HIV-positive patients who underwent kidney or kidney/pancreas transplantation at our center between 2007 and 2010. We performed a retrospective chart review to ascertain graft function, as well as virologic and immunologic status post-transplant. Renal function (glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine concentrations) improved in all subjects post-transplant, and six of seven (85.8%) subjects remained virologically suppressed with no progression to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Overall, two-year graft and patient survival rates were 85.5%. HIV seropositive End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients represent a new population of patients that can be successfully transplanted. This offers a new dimension in care for successful HAART therapy to prolong the life of HIV-infected patients."
19487,0.01,2.0000,"In Mozambique, the evaluation of retention in HIV care and ART programmes is limited. To assess rate and predictors of attrition (no retention in care) and HAART effectiveness in HIV-1 infected patients who pay for medication and laboratory testing in Mozambique, we conducted a multicenter survey of HIV-1-infected patients who started HAART during 2002-2006. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess risk of attrition and of therapy failure. Overall, 142 patients from 16 healthcare centers located in the capital city Maputo were followed-up for 22.2 months (12.1-46.7). The retention rate was 75%, 48% and 37% after one, two and three years, respectively. Risk of attrition was lower in patients with higher baseline CD4 count (P = 0.022) and attending healthcare center 1 (HCC1) (P = 0.013). The proportion of individuals with CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/µL was 55% (78/142) at baseline and decreased to 6% (3/52) at 36 months. Among the patients with available VL, 86% (64/74) achieved undetectable VL levels. The rate of immunologic failure was 17.2% (95% CI: 12.6-22.9) per 100 person-years. Risk of failure was associated to higher baseline CD4 count (P = 0.002), likely reflecting low adherence levels, and decreased with baseline VL ≥ 10,000 copies/mL (P = 0.033). These results suggest that HAART can be effective in HIV-1 infected patients from Mozambique that pay for their medication and laboratory testing. Further studies are required to identify the causes for low retention rates in patients with low CD4 counts and to better understand the association between healthcare setting and attrition rate."
7067,0.01,2.0000,"Inconsistent use of antiviral medications for the treatment of HIV may lead to the emergence of resistant strains in HIV-infected adults. Patterns of adherence with these drug regimens in adolescents remains unknown. Identifying nonadherence in HIV-infected patients to antiviral regimens and developing corrective measures could improve patient outcomes. This study was undertaken to understand adherence in HIV-infected youths engaged in care and to reduce patterns of nonadherence. A retrospective analysis of 25 charts (78%) of HIV-infected youths (n = 32, age 13 to 21 years) were consecutively reviewed from January 1993 to May 1998. Charts were reviewed for documentation of factors previously documented to be associated with adherence: housing stability, social support, prior sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and/or pregnancy, HIV exposure category, number of clinic visits, number of pills per day, number of medications per day, knowledge of medication schedule, age, gender, race/ethnicity, health status as revealed by CD4 count and viral load, and recorded patterns of adherence to medications and clinic appointments. Thirteen of the 18 (72%) patients who were receiving antiretroviral medication were nonadherent. Sixty-seven percent of the females and 80% of the males reported missing doses. Housing instability (p = 0.031) and/or length of treatment with antiviral medications (months of treatment) (p = 0.043) were significantly correlated with nonadherence. The stability of the adolescents' living situations was the most significant correlate of medication adherence for this population of HIV-infected youth."
10813,0.01,2.0000,"Macrophage adherence, an important regulatory signal, has the potential to affect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) production either directly or by priming monocytes to respond to other activating signals. We have investigated the role of adherence as an activator of HIV-1 transcription and release. The effects of adherence on HIV-1 transcription were examined by using THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line, transfected with HIV long terminal repeat (LTR)-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) constructs. The effects of adherence on release of HIV-1 were investigated in both HIV-1-infected THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Adherence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated THP-1 cells to either tissue culture plastic or endothelial cells was crucial for enhanced HIV-1 transcription as measured by LTR-CAT expression. Such increased LTR-CAT expression did not occur with an HIV LTR construct containing mutated NF-kappa B binding sites. In contrast, release of whole HIV, measured by reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in tissue culture medium, was reduced upon adherence of stimulated HIV-1-infected THP-1 cells without suppression of HIV LTR-CAT transcription or p24 release. This finding suggested that activation of adherent monocytic cells interfered with HIV assembly and release. Although the reduction of RT activity following activation of HIV-1-infected MDM was independent of adhesion, adherence alone of nonstimulated HIV-infected MDM to endothelial cells was sufficient to induce a reduction in RT release. This study demonstrates that LPS stimulation of monocytic cells enhances HIV LTR transcription under adherent conditions. In contrast, activation of adherent monocytic cells infected with HIV reduced viral release."

A persistent liquoral neutrophilia and low adenosindeaminase values were observed in cerebrospinal fluid of purulent appearance. The patient responded badly to tuberculostatic treatment and died. In the antibiogram carried out resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis was observed to rifampicine and isoniazide, two of the five drugs the patient had received. The peculiarities of the clinical form of presentation similar to purulent bacterian meningitis are discussed, and the possible influence of HIV infection and the antibiotic multiresistance observed in the bad evolution of the tuberculous meningitis which the patient developed."
16665,0.01,2.0000,"A mathematical model of the interaction among CD4+ T-cells, HIV-1, and antiretroviral drugs was fitted to the viral load decline following initiation of combination therapy to estimate differences in the residual reproductive capacity of virus (R(0)) in the average patient in each group. Four regimens were studied: 12 patients on 5-drug nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTIs), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitor (PI)-containing combination therapy, 11 patients on PI-containing triple therapy, 10 patients on double NRTI therapy, and 10 patients on NNRTI-containing triple therapy. Model fits were used to estimate R(0). The NNRTI-containing triple therapy and the 5-drug regimen blocked viral replication to the greatest extent (R(0) = 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.91; and 0.90, 95% CI, 0.82-0.98, respectively), with the former being significantly better than the PI-containing triple regimen (R(0) = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92-1.03; p =.007). Both the NNRTI-containing and the 5-drug regimen, as well as the PI-containing triple therapy, were significantly better at blocking viral replication than the double NRTI therapy (R(0) = 1.04; 95% CI, 1.0-1.07). Measurement of viral load after approximately 7 days provided the most accurate measure of the degree of viral suppression induced by a given drug regimen."

3842,0.01,2.0000,"As the HIV-infected population ages and the burden of chronic comorbidities increases, adherence to medications for HIV and diabetes and hypertension is crucial to improve outcomes. We pilot-tested a pictorial aid intervention to improve medication adherence for both HIV and common chronic conditions. Adult patients with HIV and diabetes (DM) and/or hypertension (HTN) attending a clinic for underserved patients and at risk for poor health outcomes were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either a pictorial aid intervention (a photographic representation of their medications, the indications, and the dosing schedule) or a standard clinic visit discharge medication list. Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV and therapy for DM or HTN was compared. Predictors of ART adherence at baseline were determined using logistic regression. Medication adherence was assessed using medication possession ratio (MPR) for the 6-month interval before and after the intervention. Change in adherence by treatment group was compared by ANOVA. Among the 46 participants, there was a trend towards higher adherence to medications for HIV compared with medications for hypertension/diabetes (baseline median MPR for ART 0.92; baseline median MPR for the medication for the comorbid condition 0.79, p = 0.07). The intervention was feasible to implement and satisfaction with the intervention was high. With a small sample size, the intervention did not demonstrate significant improvement in adherence to medications for HIV or comorbid conditions. Patients with HIV are often medically complex and may have multiple barriers to medication adherence. Medication adherence is a multifaceted process and adherence promotion interventions require an approach that targets patient-specific barriers."
13494,0.01,2.0000,"Control of genital ulcer disease (GUD) is a proposed intervention to slow the dissemination of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Programs for the control of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) should focus on groups of high-frequency transmitters, such as prostitutes and their clientele. This study illustrates the interaction between the prevalence of chancroid, use of barrier prophylaxis against STDs, and HIV infection in a population of female prostitutes in Nairobi. Four hundred and twenty three women were evaluated. Despite the increased use of condoms, the prevalence of genital ulcers remained constant between 1986-87 and 1987-88. Genital ulcer disease was simultaneously associated with HIV infection (adjusted odds ratio: 3.7, P less than .01) whereas it was independently and inversely associated with more consistent condom use (P less than .01). The authors conclude that genital ulcer disease can be controlled in these populations but concurrent HIV infection increases the difficulty of this intervention."

A macaque models of AIDS could greatly facilitate an in vivo approach to the pathogenesis of such dysfunction. Here, we evaluated in this model the impact of infection with a pathogenic simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) on bone marrow hematopoiesis. Three groups of macaques were inoculated with 50 50% median infective doses of pathogenic SHIV 89.P, which expresses env of dual-tropic HIV type 1 (HIV-1) 89.6 primary isolate. During the primary phase of infection, animals were treated with either a placebo or highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) combining zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir, initiated 4 or 72 h postinfection (p.i.) and administered twice a day until day 28 p.i. In both placebo-treated and HAART-treated animals, bone marrow colony-forming cells (CFC) progressively decreased quite early, during the first month p.i. One year p.i., both placebo- and HAART-treated animals displayed decreases in CFC to about 56% of preinfection values. At the same time, a dramatic decrease (greater than 77%) of bone marrow CD34(+) long-term culture-initiating cells was noted in all animals were found. No statistically significant differences between placebo- and HAART-treated monkeys were found. These data argue for an early and profound alteration of myelopoiesis at the level of the most primitive CD34(+) progenitor cells during SHIV infection, independently of the level of viremia, circulating CD4(+) cell counts, or antiviral treatment."

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of tenofovir DF in adolescents with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adolescents 12 to <18 years of age with CHB were randomized to tenofovir DF 300 mg (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) once daily for 72 weeks. The primary endpoint was virologic response (HBV DNA <400 copies/mL) at week 72. One hundred six patients were enrolled; 101 patients completed 72 weeks of treatment. At baseline, 91% of patients were hepatitis B e antigen-positive and 85% had prior exposure to HBV therapy. A virologic response was observed in 89% (46/52) of patients who received tenofovir DF and 0% (0/54) of patients who received placebo (P < 0.001). Treatment response was not affected by prior HBV treatment. Furthermore, no resistance to tenofovir DF developed through week 72. Among patients with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level greater than the upper limit of normal at baseline, normalization of ALT occurred in 74% of patients receiving tenofovir DF and 31% of patients receiving placebo (P < 0.001). The rate of grade 3/4 adverse events was higher among patients treated with placebo (24%) than patients treated with tenofovir DF (10%). No patients met the safety endpoint of a 6% decrease in spine bone mineral density at week 72."
9790,0.01,2.0000,"With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) has emerged as the leading cause of death in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected patients. An atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype has been described in HIV- infected patients with a predominance of small, low density lipoprotein (SLDL) particles with accompanying elevated triglycerides and reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol. This randomized controlled pilot study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Extended Release Niacin (ERN) in improving the lipid profile in HIV patients. A total of 17 HIV positive subjects on HAART therapy with High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL) levels below 40mg/dl and Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL) below 130mg/dl were enrolled. Nine were randomized to be treated with ERN titrated from a starting level of 500mg/night and titrated to a level of 1500mg/night. Eight patients were assigned to the control arm. No placebo was used. Lipoprotein profiles of the subjects were analyzed at baseline and at the end of 12 weeks using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. At the end of 12 weeks, NMR spectroscopic analysis revealed a significant increase in overall LDL size (1.2% in ERN treated subjects vs 2.0% decrease in control patients, P=.04) and a decrease in small LDL particle concentration (17.0% in ERN treated subjects vs 21.4% increase in control patients, P=.03) in subjects receiving ERN as compared to those in the control group. Only 1 subject receiving ERN developed serious flushing which was attributed to an accidental overdose of the drug. This pilot study demonstrates that ERN therapy in HIV-infected patients with low HDL is safe and effective in improving the lipoprotein profile in these patients. "

14938,0.01,2.0000,"The use of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures to provide added feedback to health providers is receiving interest as a means of improving clinical care and patient outcomes, and contributing to more patient-centered care. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), while PROs are used in research, their application in clinical practice has been limited despite their potential utility. PRO selection is an important consideration when contemplating their use. As past reviews of PROs in HIV have focused on particular areas (e.g. disability, satisfaction with care), a more comprehensive review could better inform on the available instruments and their scope. This article reviews HIV-specific PROs to produce an inventory and to identify the central concepts targeted over time. Seven databases were searched (HAPI, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar), generating 14,794 records for evaluation. From these records, 117 HIV-specific PROs were identified and categorized based on a content analysis of their targeted concept: Health-Related Quality of Life (23; 20 %), ART and Adherence-Related Views and Experiences (19; 16 %), Healthcare-Related Views and Experiences (15; 13 %), Psychological Challenges (12; 10 %), Symptoms (12; 10 %), Psychological Resources (10; 9 %), HIV Self-Management and Self-Care (8; 7 %), HIV-Related Stigma (8; 7 %), Body and Facial Appearance (4; 3 %), Social Support (3; 3 %), Sexual and Reproductive Health (2; 2 %), and Disability (1; 1 %). This review highlights the variety and evolution of HIV-specific PROs, with the arrival of seven categories of PROs only after the advent of highly-active antiretroviral therapy. Our inventory also offers a useful resource. However, the interest of further HIV-specific PRO development should be explored in sexual health, which received little independent attention."
9046,0.01,2.0000,"This study aimed to determine the prevalence, intensity, associated factors, and effect of pain among ambulatory HIV/AIDS patients. Three-hundred two adult ambulatory HIV/AIDS patients were consecutively recruited from HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics at 2 teaching hospitals in Uganda. The presence and intensity of pain were self-reported using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI); symptom data were collected using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS-SF); and quality of life (QOL) was assessed using the Medical Outcome Scale-HIV. Forty-seven percent reported pain in the 7 days prior to the survey and pain was a symptom at the time of diagnosis for 68%. On the 0 to 10 numeric scale, 53% reported mild pain (1-4 rating), 20% reported moderate pain (5-6 rating) while 27% reported severe pain (7-10 rating). Gender was not associated with pain intensity, but reduced functional performance, increasing number of symptoms, advanced HIV disease , physical symptom distress (MSAS-SF), and number of health comorbidities were significantly associated with pain intensity (P < .04). Increasing pain intensity was associated with greater functional ability impairment (BPI functional interference index) and poorer QOL. Pain is a common symptom among ambulatory HIV/AIDS patients and has a debilitating effect on QOL. There is a significant unmet need for pain relief in the population."
19979,0.01,2.0000,"Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) appear to be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a well-established screening tool for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and future cardiovascular events in the general population. However, controversies exist on the prevalence of PAD among HIV-infected patients. In this study we aimed to measure the prevalence of PAD among HIV-infected patients and compare the ABI with carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and other known CVD risk predictors."
10305,0.01,2.0000,"The times from infection with the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) to the onset of the first clinical symptom and the development of AIDS were studied prospectively in 98 haemophiliacs and 48 blood transfusion recipients infected with the virus. Patients were followed up for a median of 61 months after infection, the dates of infection being either known exactly or estimated from the interval between the last negative and first positive HIV antibody test result. The rate of progression to AIDS was significantly higher for the transfusion recipients than for the haemophiliacs. The difference in time to the occurrence of the first clinical symptom was less pronounced between the two groups, though pointing in the same direction. The results suggest that on average roughly half of all patients positive for HIV will develop some clinical sign or symptom within five to six years after infection."
8383,0.01,2.0000,"We experienced 8 cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) complicated by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type-1 infection from 1985 to 1999. These cases showed dementia, bradykinesia, dysarthria, hemiparesis, and so on. All of the cases were severely immunocompromised hosts, because none had more than 150/mm3 CD4 + lymphocytes; indeed, 5 of the cases were below 20/mm3. Other neurological complications except PML were primary CNS lymphoma, HIV encephalitis, and CMV encephalitis. The mean life durations was 7.6 months after the first symptom appeared, for all but one of the patients; the exceptional patient lived for 24 months after. Autopsy studies of the central nervous systems were performed for 7 cases, all of which showed extensive demyelinating lesions of the white matter, and in some cases these extended into the spinal cord. In contrast to Western countries, in Japan there have been few reports of AIDS-associated PML. Thus, this report was thought to be important here."

4130,0.01,2.0000,"Previous research suggested that the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) was associated with increased risky sexual behavior. This study examined the relationship between unprotected anal or vaginal sex (UAV) and ART use and adherence in a cross-sectional survey conducted in 874 randomly selected, sexually active patients at 6 public HIV clinics in California. Patients completed a standardized interview in 1998-1999 regarding HIV history, sexual behavior, illicit drug use, and ART use and adherence. Thirty-four percent reported UAV, defined as anal or vaginal sex without a condom within the past 3 months. Of 79% on ART, 26% reported <95% adherence. Decreased odds for UAV were found for both ART use, odds ratio (OR) 0.5 (95% CI 0.4-0.7, P < 0.001) and adherence to ART of > or = 95%, OR 0.6 (95% CI 0.4-0.8, P < 0.001). These relationships persisted in most stratified analysis for both ART use and adherence but in multivariate analysis only for ART use. An undetectable HIV RNA was associated with decreased odds of UAV, OR 0.6 (95% CI 0.5-0.8, P < 0.001). Contrary to expectations, use of and adherence to ART and their consequent suppression of HIV were associated with a decreased prevalence of self-reported risky sexual behavior."
2643,0.01,2.0000,"The authors conducted a voluntary serosurvey and educational campaign among 3394 undergraduate students attending the University of Maryland at College Park to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Two students were seropositive (0.06%, 95% confidence interval 0-0.15%). Both were homosexual men with multiple sexual partners. Despite the low prevalence of infection, potential risk factors for transmission of HIV-1 were common, as assessed by a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. These included a previous sexually transmitted disease (12.6%), male homosexual intercourse (4.8% of men), heterosexual anal intercourse (25.3%), heterosexual intercourse with a person at risk (an HIV-1 infected person, a bisexual man, a parenteral drug user, a female prostitute, or a hemophiliac) (5.2%), multiple sexual partners (21% reported 10 or more lifetime partners), and intravenous drug use (1.3%). Assessment of the efficacy of our program by comparing responses on pre- and post-test questionnaires showed gains in knowledge about heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 and an increase in the reported frequency of condom use 1-2 months after participating in the survey. The authors conclude that HIV-1 infections are occurring among college students but in our study group remain confined to persons with known high-risk behavior; however, practices that may support transmission are common, and programs designed to diminish these behaviors among college students are needed."
18286,0.01,2.0000,"Fatty liver, which frequently coexists with necro-inflammatory and fibrotic changes, may occur in the setting of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and chronic infections due to either hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These three pathologic conditions are associated with an increased prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this multidisciplinary clinical review, we aim to discuss the ever-expanding wealth of clinical and epidemiological evidence supporting a key role of fatty liver in the development of T2D and CVD in patients with NAFLD and in those with HCV or HIV infections. For each of these three common diseases, the epidemiological features, pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical implications of the presence of fatty liver in predicting the risk of incident T2D and CVD are examined in depth. Collectively, the data discussed in this updated review, which follows an innovative comparative approach, further reinforce the conclusion that the presence of fatty/inflamed/fibrotic liver might be a shared important determinant for the development of T2D and CVD in patients with NAFLD, HCV or HIV. This review may also open new avenues in the clinical and research arenas and paves the way for the planning of future, well-designed prospective and intervention studies."
10784,0.01,2.0000,"Widespread dissemination of current interventions designed to improve HIV medication adherence is limited by several barriers, including additional time and expense burdens on the health care systems. Electronic interventions could aid in dissemination of interventions in the clinic setting. This study developed and tested the feasibility and acceptability of a computer-based adaption of an empirically supported face-to-face adherence promotion intervention. HIV-positive individuals (N = 92) on antiretroviral therapy with self-reported adherence <95% were randomized to the electronic intervention + treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU only. Study outcome variables which included treatment self-efficacy and self-reported medication adherence were assessed at baseline and follow-up. Time × condition interaction effects in mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVAs) examined the differences in patterns of change in the outcome variables over time between the two groups. Participants in the electronic intervention condition reported higher levels of self-efficacy to adhere to their medication at follow-up compared to the control condition. Although nonsignificant, levels of adherence tended to improve over time in the intervention condition, while TAU adherence remained constant. This was the first study to investigate a single-session, computer-based adherence intervention. Results suggest that electronic interventions are feasible and this method may be effective at increasing self-efficacy and adherence among patients reporting suboptimal adherence levels."
18846,0.01,2.0000,"Many children in sub-Saharan Africa die from AIDS, not having accessed HIV testing and care. Children of adult antiretroviral therapy (ART) patients are a target group for HIV testing in order to increase access to care, but the HIV test coverage of this group in Malawi is unknown. In a cross-sectional survey of 832 patients at a large urban ART clinic in Blantyre, we found that 81.2% of 1223 children and 37.7% of 488 spouses of adult ART patients were reportedly not HIV tested. Wives of male patients were significantly less frequently HIV tested than husbands of female patients (53.0% vs. 72.4%, p<0.0001). Children under the age of 8 years (adjusted odds ratios [aOR] 2.76), children of female patients (aOR 2.53) and of patients whose partner had been HIV tested (aOR 2.87) were significantly more likely to have been tested for HIV. More attention needs to be given to provider initiated testing of children and spouses of ART patients."
4493,0.01,2.0000,"We examined the prevalence and risks associated with interpersonal (physical and sexual) abuse among HIV-seropositive homeless or unstably housed adults. Data were obtained from the Housing and Health Study of participants living in Baltimore, Chicago, and Los Angeles (n = 644). We used logistic regression to identify risks associated with abuse. About 77% of men and 86% of women reported ever experiencing abuse. Women were at greater risk than men for intimate partner physical abuse, childhood sexual abuse (CSA), and adulthood sexual abuse. Men and women experiencing intimate partner physical abuse reported increased risk of unprotected sex. Other risks associated with abuse include sex exchange; lifetime alcohol abuse; and depressive symptoms. Abuse prevalence among sample exceeds those found in other samples of general USA, HIV-seropositive, and homeless populations. Identifying persons at risk of abuse is needed to reduce risk among homeless or unstably housed persons living with HIV."
8426,0.01,2.0000,"Comprehensive prenatal care for HIV-infected women in the United States involves addressing mental health needs. Retrospective quantitative data are presented from HIV-infected pregnant women (n = 45) who reported childhood sexual or physical abuse (66%), abuse in adulthood by a sexual partner (25%), and abuse during pregnancy (10%). Depression and anxiety were the most commonly reported psychological symptoms; more than half of the sample reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including HIV-related PTSD (PTSD-HIV). There was a strong association between depression and PTSD as well as between anxiety and PTSD-HIV. The majority of infants received zidovudine at birth and continued the recommended regimen. All but one infant were determined to be noninfected. Women improved their CD4(+) T cell counts and HIV RNA viral loads while in prenatal care. Results support the need for targeted prenatal programs to address depression, anxiety, substance use, and trauma in HIV-infected women. "
9290,0.01,2.0000,"To investigate the epidemiology of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among injecting drug users, the authors assessed the prevalence of HBV seromarkers among 2,558 injecting drug users recruited through street outreach in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1988-1989. Eighty percent of the drug users had at least one HBV seromarker. HBV seropositivity was associated with increasing age, duration of injecting drug use, African-American ethnicity, injecting drugs at least once daily, and sharing needles or visiting ""shooting galleries"" during the previous 11 years, but not with high-risk sexual behaviors or a history of sexually transmitted disease. This finding is possibly due to the relative inefficiency of sexual transmission as compared with parenteral transmission in injecting drug users. In addition, HBV seropositivity was strongly associated with seropositivity for hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus. The authors conclude that HBV transmission among injecting drug users occurs primarily through the sharing of contaminated drug injecting equipment rather than through sexual relations, and that efforts to prevent HBV infection must target injecting drug users early in their injecting careers."
16505,0.01,2.0000,"Comparisons of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression between risk groups are difficult primarily because of the long incubation period of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and unknown times of infection. This is believed to be the first study that directly compared changes in T-lymphocyte subsets following HIV-1 seroconversion between cohorts of predominantly black injecting drug users and predominantly white homosexual men. Longitudinal trends of CD4 and CD8 percentages of total lymphocytes during 4 years were modeled as piecewise linear functions with a two-parameter correlation structure to accommodate within-person repeated observations. Prior to seroconversion the 151 injecting drug users started with similar CD4% and CD8% levels compared with the 99 homosexual men. Following seroconversion, larger changes were observed overall in the homosexual men compared with the injecting drug users for both markers (p < or = 0.001). The major discrepancies, however, were limited to the first 2 years. Subsequently, the CD4% levels of the two cohorts converged and then declined at similar rates. These comparative analyses of HIV seroconverters in homosexual men and injecting drug users suggest that risk group has only a minor effect on the initial course of HIV infection."

2054,0.01,2.0000,"Bone disorders such as osteopenia and osteoporosis have been recently reported in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but their etiology remains still unknown. The prevalence estimates vary widely among the different studies and can be affected by concomitant factors such as the overlapping of other possible conditions inducing bone loss as lypodystrophy, advanced HIV-disease, advanced age, low body weight or concomitant use of other drugs. All the reports at the moment available in the literature showed a higher than expected prevalence of reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV-infected subjects both naïve and receiving potent antiretroviral therapy compared to healthy controls. This controversial can suggest a double role played by both antiretroviral drugs and HIV itself due to immune activation and/or cytokines disregulation. An improved understanding of the pathogenesis of bone disorders can result in better preventative and therapeutic measures. However, the clinical relevance and the risk of fractures remains undefined in HIV-population. The clinical management of osteopenia and osteoporosis in HIV-infected subjects is still being evaluated. Addressing potential underlying bone disease risk factors (e.g., smoking and alcohol intake, use of corticosteroids, advanced age, low body weight), evaluating calcium and vitamin D intake, and performing dual x-ray absorptiometry in HIV-infected individuals who have risk factors for bone disease can be important strategies to prevent osteopenia and osteoporosis in this population. The administration of bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate), with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, may be a reasonable and effective option to treat osteoporosis in these subjects."
14486,0.01,2.0000,"Summary - In the last few years, the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy has radically modified the prognosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Osteonecrosis and osteoporosis are among the bone complications recently described in HIV-infected patients. We report a preliminary study comparing 47 HIV-infected patients (31 men and 16 women) to 47 age- and sex-matched controls. Bone mineral density was lower in patients than in controls: in men, 0.919 +/- 0.120 g/cm2 vs. 1.010 +/- 0.139 g/cm2 (P = 0.01) at the total hip and 0.948 +/- 0.100 g/cm2 vs. 1.043 +/- 0.117 g/cm2 (P = 0.0008) at the lumbar spine; in women, 0.912 +/- 0.149 g/cm2 vs. 0.968 +/- 0.090 g/cm2 at the total hip (P = 0.17) and 0.989 +/- 0.152 g/cm2 vs. 1.080 +/- 0.097 g/cm2 (P = 0.01) at the lumbar spine. HIV-infected males were more likely to have osteopenia and osteoporosis, as compared to the male controls (19 vs. 14 and 4 vs. 1, respectively, P = 0.02). None of the women had osteoporosis; nine HIV-infected women and one female control had osteopenia (P = 0.003). No fractures were recorded. In this preliminary study, no evidence supporting a relationship between bone loss and protease inhibitor treatment was found."

16449,0.01,2.0000,"In order to study the influence of cigarette smoking and drinking of alcohol on the progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), eighty HIV infected homosexual men were included in a prospective study from the date of diagnosed HIV seropositivity. Two men were lost to follow-up. The mean follow-up time was 62 months. By the end of the follow-up period 26 out of 78 subjects (33%) were diagnosed with AIDS. When controlling for age, year of HIV diagnosis, number of male lifetime partners and frequency of receptive anal intercourse, the adjusted relative risk of being diagnosed with AIDS for the group smoking 1-20 cigarettes daily was 0.4 (0.2-1.2, 95% confidence interval) and 1.1 (0.4-2.7, 95% confidence interval) for the group smoking more than 20 cigarettes daily, as opposed to the non-smoking group. The adjusted relative risk of progression to AIDS for daily alcohol drinkers as opposed to less frequent drinkers was 0.8 (0.3-2.2, 95% confidence interval). The adjusted relative risks of receptive anal intercourse often or usually and more than 500 lifetime male partners were 2.2 and 2.0, respectively. These estimates, however, were not significantly above 1.0. The lack of positive association between cigarette smoking, drinking of alcohol and progression to AIDS found in this study as well as in other studies, may have implication for the understanding of the pathogenesis of the HIV disease and for counselling HIV infected subjects."
10469,0.01,2.0000,"Psychosocial function and adherence to antiretroviral regimen are key factors in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease management. Alexithymia (AL) is a trait deficit in the ability to identify and describe feelings, emotions and bodily sensations. A structural equation model was used to test whether high levels of AL indirectly relate to greater non-adherent behavior and HIV disease severity via psychosocial dysfunction. Blood draws for HIV-1 viral load and CD4 T-lymphocyte, along with psychosocial surveys were collected from 439 HIV positive adults aged 18-73 years. The structural model supports significant paths from: (1) AL to non-active patient involvement, psychological distress, and lower social support, (2) psychological distress and non-active involvement to non-adherent behavior, and (3) non-adherence to greater HIV disease severity (CFI = .97, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .05). A second model confirmed the intermediary effect of greater patient assertiveness on the path from AL to social support and non-active patient involvement (CFI = .94, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .05). Altogether, AL is indirectly linked with HIV disease management through it's association with poor psychosocial function, however greater patient assertiveness buffers the negative impact of AL on relationship quality with healthcare providers and members of one's social support network."
3514,0.01,2.0000,"Symptom clusters are gaining importance given HIV/AIDS patients experience multiple, concurrent symptoms. This study aimed to: determine clusters of patients with similar symptom combinations; describe symptom combinations distinguishing the clusters; and evaluate the clusters regarding patient socio-demographic, disease and treatment characteristics, quality of life (QOL) and functional performance. This was a cross-sectional study of 302 adult HIV/AIDS outpatients consecutively recruited at two teaching and referral hospitals in Uganda. Socio-demographic and seven-day period symptom prevalence and distress data were self-reported using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Schedule. QOL was assessed using the Medical Outcome Scale and functional performance using the Karnofsky Performance Scale. Symptom clusters were established using hierarchical cluster analysis with squared Euclidean distances using Ward's clustering methods based on symptom occurrence. Analysis of variance compared clusters on mean QOL and functional performance scores. Patient subgroups were categorised based on symptom occurrence rates. Five symptom occurrence clusters were identified: Cluster 1 (n=107), high-low for sensory discomfort and eating difficulties symptoms; Cluster 2 (n=47), high-low for psycho-gastrointestinal symptoms; Cluster 3 (n=71), high for pain and sensory disturbance symptoms; Cluster 4 (n=35), all high for general HIV/AIDS symptoms; and Cluster 5 (n=48), all low for mood-cognitive symptoms. The all high occurrence cluster was associated with worst functional status, poorest QOL scores and highest symptom-associated distress. Use of antiretroviral therapy was associated with all high symptom occurrence rate (Fisher's exact=4, P<0.001). CD4 count group below 200 was associated with the all high occurrence rate symptom cluster (Fisher's exact=41, P<0.001). Symptom clusters have a differential, affect HIV/AIDS patients' self-reported outcomes, with the subgroup experiencing high-symptom occurrence rates having a higher risk of poorer outcomes. Identification of symptom clusters could provide insights into commonly co-occurring symptoms that should be jointly targeted for management in patients with multiple complaints."
7750,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serodiscordant couples are at risk of sexual transmission of HIV between the infected and uninfected partner. We assessed New York area care providers for people living with HIV regarding attitudes, knowledge, and practice patterns toward fertility and conception in serodiscordant couples. Data were collected via a survey distributed in October 2013. Seventeen percent of respondents reported prescribing antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for a woman in a serodiscordant couple, and 38% percent of respondents reported having counseled serodiscordant couples on timed, unprotected intercourse without PrEP. Respondents who reported being ""very"" familiar with the data on HIV transmission in serodiscordant couples were more likely to report counseling their patients in timed, unprotected intercourse compared with those who reported less familiarity with the data (41% vs. 8%, p = 0.001). Although only 20% reported being ""very"" or ""somewhat"" familiar with the data on the safety of sperm washing with intrauterine insemination, those who did were more likely to have reported referring a patient for assisted reproductive technology (61% vs. 32%, p = 0.006). Effective patient counseling and referral for appropriate reproductive options were associated with knowledge of the literature pertaining to these options. This emphasizes the need for further provider education on reproductive options and appropriate counseling for serodiscordant couples. "
16949,0.01,2.0000,"The aim of this work was to compare thymic function-related markers for predicting early CD4 T-cell repopulation in adult HIV-infected patients under HAART. Forty-three consecutive antiretroviral-naive patients were prospectively analysed for clinical, biochemical, immunological and virological parameters at starting HAART, and followed for 4 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter. At baseline, all patients underwent a thoracic computer tomography scan, in order to measure thymic volume, as well, T-cell phenotype (naive CD4 and CD8 T cells) and the number of TREC-bearing cells were obtained. CD4 cell repopulation was considered as an increase > or = 200 cells/mm3 above baseline count. Twenty-seven patients (62.8%) increased > or = 200 cells/mm3 above baseline levels during the follow-up. The median time to event was 182 days (84-537 days). On the univariate analysis, to be younger than 36 years, showing a CD4 cell count > or = 272 cells/mm3, a total naive T-cell count > or = 128 cells/mm3, a TREC-bearing cell count > or = 0.74 cells/mm3, and a thymic volume > or =3.07 cc at baseline were statistically associated to the event studied. However, when the multivariate analysis was performed, only thymic volume at baseline was independently associated (P=0.002) to CD4 cell recovery. This co-variable was identified as a positive predictor [hazard ratio, 1.22 (95% confidence interval: 1.16-1.28)]. In summary, data presented herewith show that thymic volume is the best thymic function-related marker for predicting early CD4 T-cell recovery in adult HIV-infected patients under HAART."

It is unknown whether HCV RNA status is associated with mortality in HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs). We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study to examine the impact of HCV RNA status on overall and cause-specific mortality in HIV-infected IDUs. We computed cumulative mortality and used Cox Regression to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRR). We identified 392 HIV-infected patients of whom 284 (72%) had chronic HCV-infection (HCV RNA positive patients) and 108 (28%) had cleared the HCV-infection (HCV RNA negative patients). During 1286 person-years of observation (PYR), 157 persons died (MR = 122/1000 PYR, 95% CI: 104-143). The estimated 5-year probabilities of survival were 0.58 (95% CI: 0.51-0.65) in the chronically HCV-infected and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.40-0.63) in the cleared HCV group. Chronic HCV-infection was not associated with overall mortality: MRR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.59-1.21. In HIV-infected Danish IDUs, chronic HCV-infection is not associated with increased mortality compared to patients who have cleared the infection."

Standardized data were collected from patients at the time of TB diagnosis, two months into TB treatment, and at completion of TB treatment. We calculated composite physical and mental health scores for patients that completed treatment, compared scores during treatment, and analyzed factors associated with improvements in these scores. Of 493 patients analyzed, 488 (99%) reported at least one physical health complaint and 210 (43%) had at least one mental health complaint at baseline. Improvement in physical health occurred in 377 (76%) and improvement in mental health occurred in 182 (37%). In a multivariable analysis, factors strongly associated with improvement in physical health were receiving TB treatment in Bangkok, age greater than 50 years, and improved mental health. Improvement in mental health was strongly associated with alleviation of physical symptoms, including bloody urine, foot pain, headache, muscle weakness, difficulty sleeping, chest pain, and dizziness."
10198,0.01,2.0000,"The interaction between limited resources, living in conflict areas, and complexity of HIV treatment may impact negatively on adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Nonadherence may lead to development of resistant strains that may further increase the costs of management. The aim of this study was to compare the level of adherence to ART among internally displaced persons (IDPs) and non-IDPs and determine the factors associated with nonadherence. A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to February 2008 among adults receiving ART from Lacor Hospital. Systematic sampling was used to select 200 participants. Adherence was assessed through patients' self-reports over a 4-day period. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and analyzed in SPSS version 12 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Patients were considered to be adherent if they took 95% or more of their medicines. Adherence rates among IDP and non-IDP patients were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Factors associated with nonadherence were determined using logistic regression. The overall mean 4-day adherence was 99.5%. There was no significant difference in adherence between IDPs and non-IDPs (99.6% and 99.5%, respectively). Being on first-line regimen of ART (odds ratio [OR] = 22.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.48-333.33) and feeling that staff at the health centre were condemning (OR = 22.22, 1.53-333.33) were independently associated with nonadherence. Our study was limited in using only self-reports to assess adherence. In conclusion, patients in conflict areas can achieve high levels of adherence. Interventions to reduce nonadherence should address health provider-patient interaction and patients on first-line regimens."

This study reviews the roles of genetic polymorphisms, HIV-1 infection, and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in lipid metabolism. Lipid abnormalities can vary according to the HAART regimen, such as those with protease inhibitors (PIs). However, genetic factors may also be involved in dyslipidemia because not all patients receiving the same HAART regimen and with comparable demographic, virological, and immunological characteristics develop variations in the lipid profile. Polymorphisms in a large number of genes are involved in the synthesis of structural proteins, and enzymes related to lipid metabolism account for variations in the lipid profile of each individual. As some genetic polymorphisms may cause dyslipidemia, these allele variants should be investigated in HIV-1-infected patients to identify individuals with an increased risk of developing dyslipidemia during treatment with HAART, particularly during therapy with PIs. This knowledge may guide individualized treatment decisions and lead to the development of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of dyslipidemia in these patients. "
19831,0.01,2.0000,"As a chronic illness, HIV/AIDS requires life-long treatment adherence and retention-and thus sufficient attention to the psychosocial dimensions of chronic disease care in order to produce favourable antiretroviral treatment (ART) outcomes in a sustainable manner. Given the high prevalence of depression in chronic HIV patients, there is a clear need for further research into the determinants of depression in this population. In order to comprehensively study the predictors of depressive symptoms in HIV patients on ART, the socio-ecological theory postulates to not only incorporate the dominant individual-level and the more recent community-level approaches, but also incorporate the intermediate, but crucial family-level approach. The present study aims to extend the current literature by simultaneously investigating the impact of a wide range individual-level, family-level and community-level determinants of depression in a sample of 435 patients enrolled in the Free State Province of South Africa public-sector ART program. Structural equation modeling is used to explore the relationships between both latent and manifest variables at two time points. Besides a number of individual-level correlates-namely education, internalized and external stigma, and avoidant and seeking social support coping styles-of depressive symptoms in HIV patients on ART, the study also revealed the important role of family functioning in predicting depression. While family attachment emerged as the only factor to continuously and negatively impact depression at both time points, the second dimension of family functioning, changeability, was the only factor to produce a negative cross-lagged effect on depression. The immediate and long-term impact of family functioning on depression draws attention to the role of family dynamics in the mental health of people living with HIV/AIDS. In addition to individual-level and community-based factors, future research activities should also incorporate the role of the family context in research into the mental health of HIV patients, as our results demonstrate that the familial context in which a person with HIV on ART resides is inextricably interconnected with his/her health outcomes."
7476,0.01,2.0000,Weight loss is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Men with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) lose body cell mass. Hypogonadism is also common. This study tested the efficacy of a testosterone transscrotal patch (6 mg/day) in improving body cell mass and treating hypogonadism in these patients.
19925,0.01,2.0000,"In China, acute stigma accompanying an HIV diagnosis can lead to self-isolation. In a cultural setting where family relationships are highly valued and contribute critically to well-being, such self-isolation can thwart HIV self-management and engagement in medical care, and so heighten risk for health disparities. To understand this phenomenon, we conducted individual in-depth interviews with 34 persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLwHA) in Shanghai and Beijing. Inductive content analysis revealed a range of forms of self-isolation motivation, beliefs, and behaviors influenced by: 1) internalized stigma and desire to avoid discrimination; 2) HIV-related factors such as HIV knowledge and disease progression; and 3) familial factors such as a sense of responsibility and family members' reactions. Based on a proposed framework centering on dialectical family influences (whereby PLwHA are pushed away from, yet pulled toward the family fold), implications for provision of multidisciplinary care in medical settings are considered, including culturally appropriate strategies to decrease health disparities."
15721,0.01,2.0000,"This paper presents a summary of the evidence review group (ERG) report into the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, in accordance with the licensed indication, based upon the evidence submission from Gilead to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as part of the single technology appraisal process. The submitted clinical evidence included two international randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing tenofovir with adefovir, and a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) using Bayesian methodology to compare tenofovir with other nucleos(t)ide analogues using direct and indirect RCT evidence. There were no statistically significant differences between tenofovir and adefovir in overall adverse events although, in hepatitis B 'e' antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients, there was a higher incidence of mild nausea in the tenofovir treatment group. The primary outcome, 'complete response', was a composite end point defined as histology response and hepatitis B virus DNA below 400 copies/ml. For both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients, a significantly greater proportion had a complete response after 48 weeks with tenofovir than with adefovir. There was no statistically significant difference in histological response in either group of patients compared with adefovir. The MTC could only generate results for HBeAg positive nucleos(t)ide naive patients as there was insufficient evidence for other subgroups. The probability of achieving undetectable HBV DNA with tenofovir was found to be significantly higher than that for all other treatments considered in the analysis at the 0.05 level. The analysis demonstrated that there is a 98% probability that tenofovir is the most potent nucleos(t)ide in terms of this outcome. The manufacturer's submission concluded that tenofovir is a cost-effective option as first-line treatment. For HBeAg-positive patients, tenofovir followed by lamivudine has an incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) of 9940 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, compared with lamivudine followed by tenofovir. A more appropriate treatment strategy of tenofovir followed by tenofovir plus lamivudine has an ICER of 13,619 pounds per QALY gained, compared with lamivudine followed by tenofovir. For HBeAg-negative patients, tenofovir followed by lamivudine has an ICER of 9811 pounds per QALY gained, compared with best supportive care. A more clinically appropriate treatment strategy of tenofovir followed by tenofovir plus lamivudine has an ICER of 13,854 pounds per QALY gained, compared with tenofovir followed by lamivudine. The ERG uncovered a number of errors in the submission and these ICERs approximately doubled when the analysis was corrected and reran. The guidance issued by NICE on 22 July 2009 states that tenofovir disoproxil, within its marketing authorization is recommended as an option for the treatment of people with chronic HBe-Ag-positive or HBe-Ag-negative hepatitis B in whom antiviral treatment is indicated."
683,0.01,2.0000,"About 130-170 million people are infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide and more than 350000 people die each year of HCV-related liver diseases. The combination of pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) was recommended as the treatment of choice for chronic hepatitis C for nearly a decade. In 2011 the directly acting antivirals (DAA) HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, were approved to treat HCV-genotype-1 infection, each in triple combination with Peg-IFN and RBV. These treatments allowed higher rates of SVR than the double Peg-IFN + RBV, but the low tolerability and high pill burden of these triple regimes were responsible for reduced adherence and early treatment discontinuation. The second and third wave DAAs introduced in 2013-2014 enhanced the efficacy and tolerability of anti-HCV treatment. Consequently, the traditional indicators for disease management and predictors of treatment response should be revised in light of these new therapeutic options. This review article will focus on the use of the markers of HCV infection and replication, of laboratory and instrumental data to define the stage of the disease and of predictors, if any, of response to therapy in the DAA era. The article is addressed particularly to physicians who have patients with hepatitis C in care in their everyday clinical practice. "
2501,0.01,2.0000,"Nonoptimal liver grafts, and among them organs from anti-HBc+ donors, are increasingly used for liver transplantation. In this retrospective study including 1065 adult liver transplantations performed between 1977 and 2012, we analyzed long-term patient and graft survival and occurrence of HBV infection. A total of 52 (5.1%) patients received an anti-HBc+ graft. The 10-year graft and patient survival of these recipients were 50.9% and 59.0% compared to 72.0% and 76.5% (P = 0.001; P = 0.004) of patients receiving anti-HBc- grafts, respectively. Cox regression model showed that high urgency allocation (P = 0.003), recipient age (P = 0.027), anti-HCV+ recipients (P = 0.005), and anti-HBc+ organs (P = 0.048) are associated with decreased graft survival. Thirteen of 52 (25.0%) patients receiving anti-HBc+ grafts developed post-transplant HBV infection within a mean of 2.8 years. In this study, antiviral prophylaxis did not have significant impact on HBV infection, but long-term survival (P = 0.008). Development of post-transplant HBV infection did not affect adjusted 10-year graft survival (100% vs. 100%; P = 1). Anti-HBc+ liver grafts can be transplanted with reasonable but inferior long-term patient and graft survival. The inferior graft survival is not, however, related with post-transplant HBV infection as long as early diagnosis and treatment take place. "
3526,0.01,2.0000,"Antiretroviral treatment (ART) significantly reduces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) HIV-1 RNA levels and residual viremia is less frequently found in CSF than in blood. However, persistent intrathecal immunoactivation is common, even after several years of ART. To investigate whether low-level CSF viremia and residual immunoactivation within the central nervous system (CNS) derive from ongoing local viral replication, we conducted a study of treatment intensification in patients on effective ART."
14834,0.01,2.0000,"To determine whether matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is a potential mediator involved in the frequently detected blood-brain barrier leakage in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, zymography was used to detect MMP-9 activity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of 80 HIV-infected patients and of 10 control patients. CSF MMP-9 activity was detected in 40% of HIV-infected patients (but not in controls) and was significantly more frequent in HIV-infected patients than in those without neurologic deficits (50% vs. 13.6%). The frequency of CSF MMP-9 activity did not significantly differ between neurologically symptomatic HIV-infected patients with or without opportunistic central nervous system disease (51.6% vs. 48.1%). Additionally, the presence of CSF MMP-9 activity in HIV-infected patients was associated with an increased CSF white blood cell count and an elevated CSF-to-serum albumin ratio, suggesting that it may play a role in blood-brain/CSF barrier leakage in HIV-infected patients."
10572,0.01,2.0000,"Liver transplantation (OLT) recipients who receive a graft from donors positive for hepatitis B virus (HBV) anti-core antibodies may develop overt ""de novo"" HBV infection. The study was undertaken to explore how often HBV infection may remain occult after OLT for hepatitis C, and whether it may represent a factor of graft fibrosis progression. We studied 30 consecutive patients transplanted for hepatitis C liver disease. Specimens from the native liver and from the graft were searched for occult HBV infection (O-HBV). In the native liver, 8/30 patients had detectable O-HBV; during the follow-up, O-HBV infection was demonstrated in 14 graft specimens. Graft O-HBV was associated with older donor age (> or =50 yr; 8/9 vs. 6/21, p < 0.005). Recipients with graft O-HBV and no O-HBV in the native liver who received their grafts from donors aged >40 yr had faster fibrosis progression than recipients with no post-transplant O-HBV, whose grafts came from donors aged >40 yr and recipients whose grafts came from donors aged < or =40 yr (4/7 vs. 1/7 vs. 2/16, p < 0.05). In OLT recipients, O-HBV is more likely to occur when grafts are obtained from aged donors and may affect the rate of fibrosis progression because of recurrent hepatitis C."
16144,0.01,2.0000,"Recent policies, guidelines, and laws reflect promising preliminary outcomes among transplant recipients with HIV infection, and ethical analyses suggest that it is not justifiable to deny solid organ transplantation based solely on HIV-infection status. These studies consistently describe stable HIV disease following liver and kidney transplantation. Despite good graft survival, kidney allograft rejection occurs frequently, and serious non-AIDS-defining infections requiring hospitalization are common following antirejection therapy. Profound interactions between immunosuppressants and antiretroviral drugs require careful monitoring, dose adjustment, and highly effective communication between the patient and a multidisciplinary group of health care providers. Despite these scientific and policy advances, many health care providers and patients remain unaware of ongoing progress in this field. The implications are critical, as late referral for liver transplant evaluation increases the pretransplant mortality risk. Because important patient selection and clinical management questions remain, it is critical that ongoing studies are completed quickly."
4235,0.01,2.0000,"Two patients, with decompensated liver cirrhosis due to a chronic hepatitis type D, received an auxiliary partial liver graft. Both grafts were infected by hepatitis B and D virus. The appearance of hepatitis B and D antigens in the graft were investigated in serial liver biopsies in relation to light microscopical and biochemical changes. One week after transplantation HDAg could already be demonstrated in 1-50 percent of hepatocytic nuclei, in one graft combined with HBsAg along the cell membranes. In the three-week biopsies the expression of HBsAg had increased. After 7-9 weeks both grafts showed biochemical and histological evidence of an acute hepatitis; at that time HBcAg and HBeAg had appeared in the nucleus and cytoplasm of many hepatocytes. Thereafter HBcAg and HBeAg expression in the liver tissue decreased slowly, and acute hepatitis transformed into chronic hepatitis. Two and three years after transplantation both grafts showed good function, with only minimal fibrosis in one and severe fibrosis in the other. HDAg and HBsAg expression persisted, while HBc and HBeAg disappeared in the one with minimal fibrosis and decreased in the other. It is concluded that the course of HBV with HDV co-infection in liver grafts includes an excellent medium-term prognosis."
3232,0.01,2.0000,"In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, symptoms of underlying illness may promote weight loss through decreased caloric intake, increased metabolic needs, or nutrient malabsorption. We evaluated disease symptoms as predictors of acute weight loss (i.e., loss of > or =5% of weight). HIV-infected men and women (n=415) were telephoned every 5 weeks to obtain information about weight and recent symptoms. Weight change between each pair of consecutive calls (telephone intervals, 2814) was calculated. Acute weight loss occurred across 4.5% of intervals and among 24% of individuals. Patients reported > or =1 symptom before 58% of telephone intervals. The most common symptoms or symptom complexes before intervals were diarrhea (21% of patients), anorexia (17%), upper respiratory symptoms (16%), skin symptoms (12%), and abdominal pain (12%). Trouble swallowing (6%) and oral symptoms (7%) were less common. Risk of acute weight loss was significantly increased when oral symptoms or trouble swallowing were present, and it was decreased when highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was used or when diarrhea was not present. Even when HAART is being administered, clinicians should remain vigilant regarding weight loss, oral symptoms, and trouble swallowing."

11460,0.01,2.0000,"Since 2001, cases of hepatitis C virus (HCV) sexual transmission have been reported in France, among HIV-positive gay men who do not inject drugs. An earlier study focused on the incidence of acute hepatitis C and risk factors associated with HCV transmission. The present study, based on in-depth interviews, aimed to highlight the biography, the sexual practices and the experiences of gay men infected with HCV. Beyond an apparent uniformity, the group of interviewees illustrates a variety of situations, life stories and health pathways, depending on their age. These well-adjusted gay men were used to engaging in unprotected sexual practices, but before their diagnosis they largely ignored HCV-transmission risk, which was associated in their mind with a pejorative drug addict image. Once diagnosed with acute hepatitis C, they experienced a critical and emotional period during which they were open to discuss their sexual practices and reconsider risk-reduction procedures, without being willing to give up on their satisfying sex life. Health educators should consider labelling hepatitis C as an STI in order to disrupt its negative image and to help HIV-positive gay man raise their awareness of HCV-transmission risks and implement better risk-reduction strategies."
15972,0.01,2.0000,"Relatively little is known about cognitive changes in early human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This study examined cognitive functioning in 46 HIV-positive gay men relative to an age and education equivalent group of 13 HIV-negative gay men. The HIV-positive men were asymptomatic except for lymphadenopathy or T4 counts less than 700. The cognitive battery measured language, memory, visuospatial, information processing speeds, reasoning, attention, and psychomotor processes. The HIV-positive group was significantly slower in processing information and performed significantly less well than the HIV-negative group on certain verbal memory measures. Deviations of 1 as well as 2 SDs from the norm/control group mean on four or more tests were observed in 43% and 22% of the HIV-positive subjects, respectively, compared with 8% and none of the HIV-negative subjects, respectively. The results suggest that cognitive inefficiency occurs in a subsample of individuals during early HIV infection."
14748,0.01,2.0000,"A common feature of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and aging is the loss of skeletal muscle mass. Although the causes of this loss of muscle are multifactorial, there may be some shared characteristics to this loss, and therefore common strategies for its prevention or reversal. For example, loss of muscle mass early in life and early in the progression of HIV infection may result from decreased levels of physical activity. The rapid loss of skeletal muscle mass at the end of life (sometimes referred to as failure to thrive syndrome) and in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients may also have common cause: cachexia. However, it also must be pointed out that loss of skeletal muscle mass with advancing age also may result from losses of motor units, decreased rate of skeletal muscle protein synthesis, and impaired regulation of appetite. These factors have not been demonstrated to be consequences of HIV infection. The use of exercise to treat the losses of muscle size, strength, and functional capacity holds great promise. Although the losses of muscle with HIV infection may be more rapid and dramatic than those seen with aging, resistance exercise training can attenuate or arrest this loss. In elderly people, resistance exercise has been demonstrated to result in increased nitrogen balance, muscle mass and strength, functional capacity, energy requirements, and when combined with a protein calorie supplement, increased energy intake. The use of resistance exercise in HIV-infected patients may also provide similar results. This review discusses many of the changes in body composition, physiological function, and metabolism associated with aging and HIV infection. The specific effects of exercise in the elderly and in patients infected with HIV on the treatment of muscle wasting, and its consequences are also discussed."
2800,0.01,2.0000,"Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent predictor of major cardiovascular events. Cardiovascular risk is increased among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. To assess LV mass/hypertrophy in HIV infection, 654 women enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study underwent transthoracic echocardiography. There were 454 HIV-infected and 200 uninfected women, mean age 40.8 +/- 9.3 years. LV mass/height(2.7) was similar between the HIV-infected and the HIV-uninfected groups (41.4 +/- 11.1 vs. 39.9 +/- 10.3 g/h(2.7); p = 0.37). The prevalence of LVH was similar between the two groups (LVH by LV mass/height(2.7) criteria 15.0% vs. 13.0%, p = 0.29). Relative wall thickness (RWT), defined as the ratio of LV wall thickness to cavity diameter, was also similar between the HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected groups (0.36 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.37 +/- 0.06, p = 0.16). On multiple linear regression analysis adjusting for age, W/H ratio, triceps skinfold thickness, systolic/diastolic BP, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia; HIV status (b = 2.08, p = 0.02, CI 0.27-3.88); weight (b per kg = 0.15, p < 0.01, CI 0.08-0.22); and smoking duration (b per one-year increase = 0.08, p = 0.03, CI 0.01-0.16) were independent correlates of LV mass/height(2.7) (Model R(2) = 0.20, p < 0.001). Weight (aOR = 1.04, CI 1.01-1.06) and smoking duration (aOR = 1.03, CI 1.01-1.06) were independent correlates of LVH. Being HIV negative, increased age, increased triceps skinfold thickness, and higher W/H ratio were independent correlates of higher RWT. Among HIV-infected women, higher LV mass was not associated with a history of AIDS-defining illness, nadir CD4(+) count <200 cells/microl, or with the duration of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Women taking NRTIs had higher LV mass. Higher RWT was associated with current CD4(+) count. In conclusion, HIV infection is associated with greater LV mass but not with a higher prevalence of LVH. Among HIV-infected women, RWT, but not LV mass, is associated with the degree of immunosuppression."
13835,0.01,2.0000,"Coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals as a result of shared routes of transmission, and this coinfection represents a special challenge. For HIV-HCV-coinfected individuals, the burden of disease is largely related to their HCV diseases, including a faster progression to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver-related deaths. In the present thesis we investigated factors associated with spontaneous resolution and progression of HIV-HCV coinfection. In study I, we identified the study cohort of 327 individuals with HIV-HCV coinfection and a rate of spontaneous HCV resolution of 23%. We showed that female sex, coinfection with hepatitis B virus and individuals exposed through injecting drug use (IDU) or homosexual contact (MSM) had an increased rate of spontaneous HCV resolution. We speculate that differences in resolution rate may be caused by immunological memory induced by repeatedly being exposed to low-dose inoculum of HCV. In study II, we found three single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) in the interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene associated with spontaneous HCV resolution in 208 Europeans of Caucasian origin with HIV-HCV coinfection. Further, we showed that the IL28B CC genotype favourable of HCV resolution was associated with a higher HCV viral load (VL) than non-CC genotypes. These results may indicate an influence of IL28B in viral control. In study III, we conducted a survival analysis in the 264 HIV-HCV-coinfected individuals with chronic infection. We showed in a time-updated Poisson regression that HCV VL, HCV genotype 3 and IL28B CC genotype were predictors of increased mortality. This may indicate a need for closer observation in HIV-HCV-coinfected individuals with HCV genotype 3 and maybe even initiation of antiviral therapy. "
3591,0.01,2.0000,"Current HIV treatment guidelines emphasize the importance of using an active antiretroviral therapy regimen that produces full virologic suppression and immunologic competence, while at the same time providing patients with a favorable safety profile and limited risk for development of drug resistance. Etravirine (TMC125), a recently approved, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), has shown durable, superior virologic efficacy over placebo in the Phase III, randomized, double-blind DUET trials in 1,203 treatment-experienced, NNRTI-resistant, HIV-1-infected patients. Statistical significance of responses with etravirine over placebo was maintained through Week 24, 48 and 96, regardless of baseline demographics, baseline disease characteristics or the background regimen used. Etravirine has demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile; the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable with placebo in the DUET trials, with the exception of rash. The tolerability profile of etravirine also appears to be favorable in terms of neuropsychiatric and hepatic side effects. The pharmacokinetic profile of twice-daily etravirine minimizes the potential for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions and allows for its use in combination with a wide range of other agents. In addition, etravirine has a high genetic barrier to the development of resistance, further enhancing potential benefit in patients infected with NNRTI-resistant virus. The clinical efficacy and favorable safety profile of etravirine, together with its pharmacokinetic profile and high genetic barrier to resistance, make it a valuable treatment option for a wide range of treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients."
5752,0.01,2.0000,"Sera from 500 (496 male and 4 female) consecutive patients with sexually transmitted diseases (STD) were examined for the presence of HIV1 antibodies. The serological tests were done using the ELISA (Wellcozyme) and confirmed by the western blot (Biorad). Sixty (12%) of the 500 patients were HIV-1 antibody positive. Seropositivity varied with the type of STD. A positivity rate of 16% seen with genital ulcer disease is significantly higher than the 7% prevalence rate seen in STD patients with urethral discharge. Infection with more than one kind of STD increases seropositivity significantly. Of the potential risk factors identified during the interview it seems that only shaving at barbers' shop is positively associated with seroprevalence. This study suggests that the presence of STDs is associated with an increased HIV-1 seroprevalence. Therefore, any effort to reduce HIV-1 infection should aim at the control of STDs."

Sera were screened by Mixt HIV-1/HIV-2 commercial enzyme immunoassay and ELISA HTLV I/II. Each serum found positive by ELISA was confirmed by Western blot. A total of 2917 persons were interviewed, of whom 2754 (94.4%) agreed to participate and gave a blood sample. Twenty-eight were found to be HIV-1 antibody positive. The prevalence ranged from 0.25% in pregnant women to 2.9% in male CSWs. The prevalence was 1% in STD patients and 0.44% in Tb patients. None of the sera was found positive for HIV-2. The prevalence of antibodies to HTLV-1 varied from 0.12% in pregnant women to 1.21% in female CSWs. Five sera were positive for HTLV-II. These results confirm the hypothesis that the HIV epidemic in Northeastern Brazil is still limited to high risk groups. Repeated cross-sectional surveys of this type should be performed as a surveillance tool to study the dynamics of this epidemic in low prevalence areas. Defining risk factors should allow targeting of intervention strategies."
10963,0.01,2.0000,"On the basis of results of testing of 212 peripheral blood samples from ethnic Chinese individuals in five age groups, ranging from birth to adulthood, by standardized flow cytometry techniques, we studied the maturational processes that are pertinent to monitoring the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected Chinese pediatric population. While the numbers of peripheral total white cells and percent lymphocytes declined from birth to adulthood, the percent CD3+ T lymphocytes was steady among all age groups studied. The numbers of CD3+ CD4+ (T-helper) cells decreased markedly after the first year of life, followed by a slower decline afterward and then a slight increase before adulthood. The trend for CD3+ CD8+(T-suppressor) cells, however, was an increase among individuals of all age ranges. The numbers of CD19+ CD3- (B cells) increased only during the first year of life and then declined steadily, while natural killer (NK) cells showed the opposite pattern. Comparison of the results with those of studies done with a Caucasian population showed that both peripheral T-helper and T-suppressor cell numbers were low after the first year of life in the Chinese pediatric population in comparison with those in a Caucasian pediatric population. Lower B-cell counts and higher NK-cell counts were seen after the first year of life in the Chinese population than in the Caucasian population. It is important that for each HIV-infected population normative ranges of the lymphocyte subset be established to monitor HIV-infected pediatric patients."
6917,0.01,2.0000,"Late diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains a challenging issue, especially in young population, which accounts for approximately half of new HIV infections. This study aimed to assess factors associated with late diagnosis of HIV infection in young people. It employed a hospital-based case-control design, conducted during January 2012 through August 2013. A total of 193 patients aged 18-25 years old from 21 hospitals across Thailand were studied. Late diagnosis was defined as presentation when the CD4 cell count was less than 350 cells/µL within 12 months of the first HIV diagnosis, or AIDS-defining event is present within 12 months of the first HIV diagnosis. Factors associated with the late diagnosis of HIV were those who: did not live with their parent (OR 3.87; 95% CI 1.40-10.66), had no children (OR 3.25; 95% CI 1.27-8.31), had their first sexual intercourse at age older than 18 years (OR 4.25; 95% CI 1.27-14.22), had same-age or older partners (OR 3.36; 95% CI 1.39-8.08), were substance users (OR 3.65; 95% CI 1.22-10.88), believed they changed their behaviors after receiving HIV education (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.02-5.99), and sought care at regional (OR 3.19; 95% 1.31-7.79) or general hospitals (OR 3.34; 95% 1.07-10.35). Strategies for early HIV detection in young people should be reconsidered; particularly the involvement of parents and targeting the right population. "
3904,0.01,2.0000,"Access to free antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Sub-Saharan Africa has been steadily increasing over the past decade. However, the success of large-scale ART programmes depends on timely diagnosis and early initiation of HIV care. This study characterizes late presenters to HIV care in Santiago (Cape Verde) between 2004 and 2011, and identifies factors associated with late presentation for care. We defined late presentation as persons presenting to HIV care with a CD4 count below 350 cells/mm³. An unmatched case-control study was conducted using socio-demographic and behavioural data of 368 individuals (191 cases and 177 controls) collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire, comparing HIV patients late and early presented to care. Logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Results show that 51.9% were late presenters for HIV. No differences were found in gender distribution, marital status, or access to health services between cases and controls. Participants who undertook an HIV test by doctor indication were more likely to present late compared with those who tested for HIV by their own initiative. Also, individuals taking less time to initiate ART are more likely to present late. This study highlights the need to better understand reasons for late presentation to HIV care in Cape Verde. People in older age groups should be targeted in future approaches focused on late presenters to HIV care."
19082,0.01,2.0000,"Natural killer (NK) cells are a crucial component of the host innate immune system. We investigated the noncytolytic anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity of NK cells in chronically HIV-infected immune cells. Supernatants collected from NK cell cultures (both primary NK cells and NK cell lines, YTS and NK 92) inhibited HIV activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIV-infected subjects. NK supernatants (NK SN) also suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced HIV activation in chronically infected cell lines (U1 and ACH-2 cells). The antibody to interferon (IFN)-gamma blocked NK SN-mediated anti-HIV effect, while the antibodies to CC-chemokines had no impact on NK SN-mediated HIV inhibition in U1 and ACH-2 cells. Investigation of mechanism(s) responsible for the NK action showed that NK SN inhibited TNF-alpha-mediated activation of HIV-long-terminal repeat (LTR), and upregulated the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1 and phosphorylated P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The P38 MAPK inhibitor (SB 203580) blocked NK SN-mediated HIV inhibition. These data provide compelling evidence that NK cells have a critical role in controlling HIV activation in the reservoirs."
11102,0.01,2.0000,"The objective was to estimate the probability of sporadic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission to a patient from an infected surgeon due to percutaneous injury during an invasive procedure. Risk was estimated based on a model involving three probabilities: A, the probability that the surgeon will sustain a percutaneous injury during an invasive procedure; B, the probability that the sharp object causing the injury and now contaminated with the surgeon's blood will contact the patient's wound; and C, the probability that infection would be transmitted to the patient after such an exposure. The probability of transmission during one procedure is p = A x B x C. The probability of transmission to at least one patient during N procedures is 1-(1-p)N. Values for A, B, and C were estimated from prospective studies. The estimated probability of transmission from an infected surgeon to a patient during a single procedure is 0.00024-0.0024% for HIV and 0.024-0.24% for HBV if the surgeon is positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). The estimated probability of transmission to at least one patient during 3,500 procedures (estimated to be performed during an HIV-infected surgeon's remaining working life) is 0.81-8.1% for HIV; 57-100% for HBV if the surgeon is an HBeAg carrier. These estimates represent population averages and may not necessarily apply to a particular procedure performed by a particular surgeon, for which the risk may be considerably lower or higher than the estimated average. This risk assessment, which is based on limited data and does not take clusters of transmission into account, predicts that the risk of sporadic HBV transmission from infected surgeons to patients due to percutaneous injury during an invasive procedure is small and that the risk of HIV transmission is less than that for HBV. More data are needed to understand both sporadic and epidemic transmission in order to further reduce patient risk."

15083,0.01,2.0000,"Transmission of HIV-1 drug resistance has important clinical and epidemiological consequences including earlier treatment failure and forward transmission of resistance strains in high-risk groups. To evaluate the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of transmitted drug resistance in Rhode Island, we collected genotypic, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from treatment-naive individuals presenting to the largest outpatient HIV clinic in the state from January 2007 to November 2007. Sequences from 35 treatment-naive individuals were available, 83% of whom were men who had sex with men (MSM). All sequences were HIV-1 subtype B. Drug resistance mutations were identified in 7/35 [20%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.08-0.37] patients, six of whom had K103N. Two phylogenetic transmission clusters were found, involving 17% (6/35) of individuals, three in each cluster. We did not find an association between belonging to a cluster and age, gender, AIDS-defining illness, CD4 cell count, or viral load. Drug resistance mutations were more commonly observed in transmission clusters (p = 0.08). Individuals in one cluster all had K103N and were MSM who had attended local bathhouses. Individuals forming clusters were significantly more likely to have visited a bathhouse compared to nonclusters (p = 0.02). The prevalence of transmitted drug resistance in Rhode Island is high, further justifying genotypic testing on presentation to care and prior to treatment initiation. Molecular epidemiological analysis and association of resistance with phylogenetic networks using data obtained for clinical purposes may serve as useful tools for the prevention of drug resistance transmission and for contact tracing."

HTLV-I is also associated with some forms of pulmonary alveolitis, chronic arthropathy, polymyositis, and uveitis. In this study, the possible role of HTLV-I infection in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases with positive antithyroid antibody (ATA) to microsomal antigen or thyroglobulin was evaluated. In Fukuoka Prefecture or the northern part of Kyushu Island located in the southwestern part of Japan, the prevalence of patients with HTLV-I antibody was screened using the particle agglutination test and then was further confirmed either by the indirect immunofluorescence method or the western blot method. The observed prevalence in patients with thyroid disorders and the estimated prevalence calculated considering the sex- and age-specific prevalence among healthy blood donors (n = 16,008) were as follows: 19 (7.4%) vs 7.8 (3.0%) (p < 0.001) for ATA-positive chronic thyroiditis (n = 257), 21 (7.0%) vs 6.6 (2.2%) (p < 0.001) for ATA-positive Graves' disease (n = 298), 4 (4.3%) vs 2.1 (2.2%) (ns) for ATA-negative Graves' disease (n = 94), 1 (2.9%) vs 1.1 (3.1%) (ns) in ATA-negative hypothyroidism (n = 35), and 3 (1.8%) vs 5.0 (2.9%) (ns) for ATA-negative nodular goiter (n = 170). These findings thus suggest that HTLV-I infection may have some relationship to ATA-positive thyroid disorders."

8716,0.01,2.0000,"Patients who attended a sexually transmitted disease clinic in New York City in 1987 were offered enrollment in a nonblinded study to estimate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seroprevalence in adults with multiple sexual partners and to determine risk factors associated with HIV-1 infection. In addition, a blinded serosurvey of a representative sample of patients was performed to obtain an unbiased estimate of seroprevalence in clinic attendees. The seroprevalence in the blinded serosurvey was 7.5% (26/348), while the seroprevalence of the 1,201 volunteers for the nonblinded study was 11.2%. For men in the nonblinded study, the risk behaviors most strongly associated with HIV-1 infection were intravenous drug use, sexual contact with another man, and sexual contact with a female intravenous drug user. For women, intravenous drug use and sexual contact with a man at risk for HIV-1 infection (an intravenous drug user or a bisexual) were most important. The seroprevalence among persons who denied all high-risk behavior was 1% (7/723). The results of this study, conducted in a city with one of the nation's highest reported cumulative incidences of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, suggest that HIV-1 infection in clinic attendees was primarily limited to intravenous drug users, homosexual/bisexual men, and the sexual partners of these two groups."

Staphylococcus aureus was the infecting microorganism in 75% of the HIV-positive patients and 86% of the HIV-negative patients. Overall survival for the HIV-positive patients was 85% compared with 93% for the HIV-negative patients. Ninety percent of patients with asymptomatic HIV infection survived, whereas 60% of patients in CDC group IV survived (P = .052). In contrast to New Jersey seroprevalence surveys showing HIV antibody in 10%-50% of intravenous drug users, HIV antibody seroprevalence rate in this selected population was 75%. IE in the HIV-seropositive intravenous drug user is essentially the same as in the seronegative user. However, patients with symptomatic HIV infection may be more likely to die from their IE. Intravenous drug users with IE have a greater-than-expected seroprevalence of HIV; the reason remains to be determined."
6829,0.01,2.0000,"Superinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in already chronically infected subjects has been documented. Whether a complete response to antiviral therapy is associated with protective immunity against reinfection with HCV remains unknown. We describe a patient who had a sustained biochemical and virologic response with loss of intrahepatic HCV RNA after a course of combination therapy using interferon plus ribavirin. Histopathologically, the chronic hepatitis was in remission on follow-up biopsy 6 months post-therapy. Unfortunately, 34 weeks post-therapy, a flare of hepatitis with reappearance of hepatitis C viremia was noted 2 months after he received injections from a non-licensed medical provider. Analysis of the core gene sequences showed a 95% homology between the HCV strains isolated before antiviral treatment and during the hepatitis flare. The data indicated that the hepatitis flare after a period of sustained response to combination therapy in this patient could have been caused by reinfection with homotypic HCV. Our observation indicates the lack of protective immunity against reinfection with HCV in patients with chronic hepatitis C, even after successful clearance of the virus. Therefore, reinforcing the education of these subjects to avoid HCV reinfection should be stressed."
9855,0.01,2.0000,"Virologic response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) typically results in a substantial rise in CD4 cell counts. We investigated factors associated with poor CD4 response among HIV-infected women followed at 6-monthly intervals in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Women with nadir CD4 counts < 350 cells/mm3 who achieved at least 6 months of plasma HIV RNA < 400 copies/ml were studied. Demographic, clinical, and treatment factors were compared between immunologic nonresponders, defined as the lower quartile of CD4 count change after two visits with virologic suppression (< 56 cell/mm3; n = 38), and the remaining group of responders (n = 115). Immunologic nonresponders had lower baseline HIV RNA levels and higher CD4 counts, more frequently used HAART 6 months prior to achieving consistent viral suppression, and more commonly had HIV RNA levels > 80 but < 400 copies/mL at both suppressive visits (21 vs. 7.8%, p = 0.024). In multivariate analysis, higher CD4 count and lower HIV RNA level at the last presuppressive visit were associated with immune nonresponse. We conclude that higher baseline CD4 count and lower HIV RNA level were associated with poor immunologic response to HAART in women with virologic suppression for at least 6 months. Persistent low level viremia may also contribute."
18170,0.01,2.0000,"BACKGROUND. Initiatives to improve early detection and access to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) services have increased over time. We assessed the immune status of patients at initial presentation for HIV care from 1997 to 2007 in 13 US and Canadian clinical cohorts. METHODS. We analyzed data from 44,491 HIV-infected patients enrolled in the North American-AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design. We identified first presentation for HIV care as the time of first CD4(+) T lymphocyte (CD4) count and excluded patients who prior to this date had HIV RNA measurements, evidence of antiretroviral exposure, or a history of AIDS-defining illness. Trends in mean CD4 count (measured as cells/mm(3)) and 95% confidence intervals were determined using linear regression adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, HIV transmission risk, and cohort. RESULTS. Median age at first presentation for HIV care increased over time (range, 40-43 years; P < .01), whereas the percentage of patients with injection drug use HIV transmission risk decreased (from 26% to 14%; P < .01) and heterosexual transmission risk increased (from 16% to 23%; P < .01). Median CD4 count at presentation increased from 256 cells/mm(3) (interquartile range, 96-455 cells/mm(3)) to 317 cells/mm(3) (interquartile range, 135-517 cells/mm(3)) from 1997 to 2007 (P < .01). The percentage of patients with a CD4 count > or = 350 cells/mm(3) at first presentation also increased from 1997 to 2007 (from 38% to 46%; P < .01). The estimated adjusted mean CD4 count increased at a rate of 6 cells/mm(3) per year (95% confidence interval, 5-7 cells/mm(3) per year). CONCLUSION. CD4 count at first presentation for HIV care has increased annually over the past 11 years but has remained <350 cells/mm(3), which suggests the urgent need for earlier HIV diagnosis and treatment."
9645,0.01,2.0000,"This article describes the occurrence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in a 39-year-old human immunodeficiency virus-positive patient. The patient sought medical care complaining of increased volume in the right mandibular angle and imaging tests showed an extensive radiolucency with undefined boundaries compromising the mandibular border. After the incisional biopsy, the patient had a pathological fracture in the region, which was properly treated in a second surgical procedure using a 2.4-mm reconstruction plate. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive marking for CD3, CD79a, Ki67, and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA. The treatment consisted of concurrent antiretroviral therapy with chemotherapy with rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. Examinations of images (2 years postoperatively) revealed complete bone repair and absence of injury recurrence. This work is important because it describes an unusual location of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and shows the importance of diagnosis and treatment of the injury at an early stage in order to promote the prognosis and survival of patients."
9571,0.01,2.0000,The recommended treatment duration of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is 48 weeks.

18588,0.01,2.0000,"Treatment rates for hepatitis C virus (HCV) are low in actual clinical settings. However, the proportion of patients eligible for treatment, especially among those coinfected with HIV, is not well known. Our aim was to determine and compare the rates for HCV treatment eligibility among HCV and HCV-HIV-coinfected persons. We assembled a national cohort of HCV-infected veterans in care from 1998-2003, using the VA National Patient Care Database for demographic/clinical information, the Pharmacy Benefits Management database for pharmacy records, and the Decision Support Systems database for laboratory data. We compared the HCV-monoinfected and HCV-HIV-coinfected subjects for treatment indications and eligibility using current treatment guidelines. Of the 27,452 subjects with HCV and 1225 with HCV-HIV coinfection, 74.0% and 84.6% had indications for therapy and among these, 43.9% of HCV-monoinfected and 28.4% of HCV-HIV-coinfected subjects were eligible for treatment. Anemia, decompensated liver disease (DLD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recent alcohol abuse, and coronary artery disease were the most common contraindications in the HCV, and anemia, DLD, renal failure, recent drug abuse, and COPD in the HCV-HIV-coinfected group. Among those eligible for treatment, only 23% of the HCV-monoinfected and 15% of the HCV-HIV-coinfected subjects received any treatment for HCV. Most veterans with HCV are not eligible for treatment according to the current guidelines. Even for those who are eligible for treatment, only a minority is prescribed treatment. Several contraindications are modifiable and aggressive management of those may improve treatment prescription rates."
706,0.01,2.0000,"HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are each associated with reduced bone mineral density, but it is unclear whether HIV/HBV coinfection is associated with an increased risk of fracture. We determined whether dually treated HIV/HBV patients had a higher incidence of hip fracture compared to treated HBV-monoinfected, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated HIV-monoinfected and HIV/HBV-uninfected patients. We conducted a cohort study among 4156 dually treated HIV/HBV-coinfected, 2053 treated HBV-monoinfected, 96,253 ART-treated HIV-monoinfected, and 746,794 randomly sampled uninfected persons within the US Medicaid populations of California, Florida, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania (1999-2007). Coinfected patients were matched on propensity score to persons in each comparator cohort. Weighted survival models accounting for competing risks were used to estimate cumulative incidences and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of incident hip fracture for dually treated coinfected patients compared to (i) HBV-monoinfected receiving nucleos(t)ide analogue or interferon alfa therapy, (ii) HIV-monoinfected on ART and (iii) uninfected persons. Dually treated coinfected patients had a higher cumulative incidence of hip fracture compared to ART-treated HIV-monoinfected (at 5 years: 1.70% vs 1.24%; adjusted HR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.03-1.83]) and uninfected (at 5 years: 1.64% vs 1.22%; adjusted HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.03-1.84]) persons. The cumulative incidence of hip fracture was higher among coinfected than treated HBV-monoinfected patients (at 5 years: 0.70% vs 0.27%), but this difference was not statistically significant in competing risk analysis (adjusted HR, 2.62 [95% CI, 0.92-7.51]). Among Medicaid enrollees, the risk of hip fracture was higher among dually treated HIV/HBV-coinfected patients than ART-treated HIV-monoinfected and uninfected persons."
3320,0.01,2.0000,"The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV-2 are common copathogens among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected individuals. HTLV-2 may confer a survival benefit among patients with HIV-1/HTLV-2 coinfections, along with lower plasma HIV-1 levels and delayed rates of CD4(+) T-cell decline. These effects have been attributed to the ability of the HTLV-2 viral transactivating Tax2 protein to induce the production of high levels of antiviral CC-chemokines and to downregulate expression of the CCR5 receptor, resulting in impaired entry of HIV-1 into CD4(+) T-cells. This study investigated the innate immunity of coinfected HIV/HTLV individuals by testing the ability of patient PBMCs to produce CC-chemokines in association CCR5 receptor modulation. The cellular proliferative responses of HIV/HTLV coinfected versus HIV monoinfected individuals were also evaluated. Higher levels of MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES (P < 0.05) were found in HIV-1/HTLV-2 coinfected group compared to HIV-1 monoinfected population. Upregulated levels of RANTES were shown in HIV-1/HTLV-1 after 1 and 3 days of culture (P < 0.05). Lymphocytes from HIV-1/HTLV-2 coinfected individuals showed significant CCR5 downregulation after 1 and 3 days of culture compared to lymphocytes from HIV-1 and uninfected groups (P < 0.05). Lower percentages of CCR5-positive cells were found in HIV-1/HTLV-1 coinfected after 3 days of incubation (P < 0.05). Levels of proliferation were significantly higher in the HIV-1/HTLV-1 group compared to HIV-1 alone (P < 0.05). HTLV-2 and HTLV-1 infections may induce the involvement of innate immunity against HIV-1 via stimulation of CC-chemokines and receptors, potentially modifying CCR5/HIV-1 binding and HIV-1 progression in coinfected individuals."
16787,0.01,2.0000,"Coinfection with HIV adversely impacts every stage of hepatitis C (HCV) infection. Liver damage in HCV infection results from host antiviral responses rather than direct viral pathogenesis. Despite depressed cellular immunity, coinfected patients show accelerated hepatic fibrosis compared with HCV monoinfected patients. This paradox is poorly understood. T-regulatory (Treg) cells (CD4+ and FOXP3+) are hypothesized to limit hepatic damage in HCV. Our hypothesis was that reduced frequency of hepatic Treg in HIV/HCV coinfection compared with HCV monoinfection may explain poorer outcomes. We quantified FOXP3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD20+ cells in liver biopsies of 35 male subjects matched by age and ISHAK fibrosis score, 12 HIV monoinfected, 11 HCV monoinfected and 12 HIV/HCV coinfected. Cell counts were performed using indirect immunohistochemical staining and light microscopy. HIV/HCV coinfected subjects had fewer hepatic FOXP3+ (P = 0.031) and CD4+ cells (P = 0.001) than HCV monoinfected subjects. Coinfected subjects had more hepatic CD8+ cells compared with HCV monoinfected (P = 0.023), and a lower ratio of FOXP3+ to CD8+ cells (0.08 vs 0.27, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed number of CD4+ cells controlled for differences in number of FOXP3+ cells. Fewer hepatic FOXP3+ and CD4+ cells in HIV/HCV coinfection compared with HCV monoinfection suggests lower Treg activity, driven by an overall loss of CD4+ cells. Higher number of CD8+ cells in HIV/HCV coinfection suggests higher cytotoxic activity. This may explain poorer outcomes in HIV/HCV coinfected patients and suggests a potential mechanism by which highly active antiretroviral therapy may benefit these patients. "

We studied the prevalence rates and risk factors for STIs among 300 brothel-based sex workers in Tel-Aviv. Throat swabs were cultured for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, urine samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Chlamydia trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae, and sera were tested for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and type 2 herpes simplex virus (HSV) antibodies. N. gonorrhoeae was cultured from throat samples of 9.0% of participants; PCR testing of urine was positive for C. trachomatis in 6.3% and for N. gonorrhoeae in 5.0%. Syphilis serology was positive (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] titres > 1:8) in 1.3% of women, HSV-2-specific immunoglobulin G was detected in 60% and HIV serology was positive in a single case (0.3%). Having STI was significantly associated with age, number of years in Israel, number of clients a week and condom use for vaginal sex. In a multivariate analysis, having STI was significantly associated with number of clients per week and condom use for vaginal sex. The high prevalence of pharyngeal gonorrhoea reflects most probably the expanding demand of clients for oral sex and the insufficient condom use in this form of sex."
14536,0.01,2.0000,"The majority of natural history studies of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have immune and viral parameters in men. Data demonstrating that women have lower HIV-1 RNA levels than men at the same CD4 cell counts have raised the question of immunologic differences in HIV-seropositive women. This study describes levels and changes in phenotypic markers of immune maturity, function, and activation in the CD4 and CD8 cell subsets in HIV-seropositive and high-risk HIV-seronegative women. Our primary hypothesis was that activation levels would be significantly higher among illicit drug users. However, results showed that HIV-1 RNA level was the strongest predictor of marker level and that both HIV-1 RNA level and CD4 cell count were independently associated with CD4 activation, but illicit drug use was not. In summary, this study demonstrated that immune activation was a significant pathogenic feature in women and that activation was driven by HIV infection and not illicit drug use."

8812,0.01,2.0000,"Recurrent Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) are an indication of unsafe sexual practices and may be associated with HCV-infection among HIV-positive men who have sex with men. In a retrospective study we analysed the laboratory data of 99 HIV-positive MSM who acquired HCV during the observation period (cases) and 176 HIV-positive MSM who remained HCV negative during the observation period (controls), all followed at the HIV/STI-clinic in Antwerp, Belgium. All laboratory confirmed STI-episodes were recorded since the date of first consultation at our clinic, until the date of HCV-diagnosis of the cases. The HCV incidence varied between 0.24 (2001) and 1.36 (2011) new cases per hundred person-years, with a peak of 2.93 new cases per hundred person-years in 2009. The number of STI-episodes per person-year follow-up was significantly higher for the cases as compared to the controls for syphilis, non-LGV and LGV Chlamydia infections (p < 0.005). When considering the incidence of STIs that occurred 1 year prior to HCV conversion, all laboratory confirmed STIs remained more frequent among cases, but only the difference in syphilis incidence was statistically significant (p < 0.01). Recurrent STIs among HIV positive MSM should be considered as a behavioural and biological risk factor for acquiring HCV and should lead to intensified screening for HCV and counselling of the patient.

6769,0.01,2.0000,"To evaluate the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and/or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in HIV-infected patients in China, an epidemiological serosurvey was conducted from May 2007 to September 2008 using a random cluster sampling design of infectious disease hospitals in seven high HIV-prevalent provinces (municipalities). Univariate analysis and logistic regression were used to study the determinants of HIV and HBV and/or HCV co-infection. The overall prevalence was 41·83% (95% CI 40·36-43·30) for anti-HCV and 12·49% (95% CI 11·50-13·48) for HBsAg, respectively. The prevalence of anti-HCV and HBsAg varied according to the route of HIV transmission. Compared to those with sexually acquired HIV infection, intravenous drug users and blood donors/recipients had the greatest risk of carrying anti-HCV. Needle sharing and unprotected sexual exposures are important modes of transmission for HBV. Further interventions including health education and harm reduction strategies should be implemented in high-risk populations."

9243,0.01,2.0000,"Bacterial pneumonia (BP) has recently been reported to be more frequent in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients than in normal hosts. This study reviews the clinical and radiologic manifestations of BP in 132 consecutive pulmonary episodes over a 15-month period. BP was defined on a clinical basis as a pulmonary infiltrate accompanied by fever and improving in a few days with conventional antibiotics (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole excluded). In patients undergoing bronchoscopy (97 procedures), semiquantitative cultures and cell differentials of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed, in addition to conventional staining and cultures for opportunistic infections. BP were frequent (45%), and the usual community-acquired pathogens were found. The radiologic manifestations of BP were often unusual, however, and 47% were indistinguishable from the typical appearance of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. BAL cultures had a sensitivity of 83 or 23%, depending on whether antibiotics were administered before bronchoscopy, using a cutoff value of greater than or equal to 10(4) bacteria/ml. The specificity of BAL culture was of 80.5% if patients with P. carinii pneumonia were taken as a control group. We conclude that BP is frequently encountered in HIV-infected patients. The clinical and radiologic presentation of BP may be indistinguishable from that of opportunistic infections. Semiquantitative cultures of BAL appear a valuable diagnostic tool to avoid unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures or treatments."

Bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and venipuncture were performed for each patient at a specific time after administration of the last dose of dapsone. Dapsone concentrations in plasma and BAL were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The apparent volume of ELF recovered by BAL was determined by using urea as an endogenous marker. The mean concentrations of dapsone in ELF at 2 h (five patients), 4 h (three patients), 12 h (two patients), 24 h (three patients), and 48 h (three patients) were 0.95, 0.70, 1.55, 0.23, and 0.45 mg/liter, respectively, while concentrations in plasma were 1.23, 0.79, 1.31, 0.83, and 0.18 mg/liter, respectively. Dapsone concentrations in ELF were 76, 79, 115, 65, and 291% of those observed in plasma at the same times, respectively. These data show that dapsone is well distributed into ELF and that a twice-weekly 100-mg prophylactic regimen results in sustained concentrations in this compartment."

This cohort study included HIV-infected patients with their first positive HIV test during 2003-2012 and CD4 count and clinical status data within 3 months of that test. Factors associated with late presentation into care (CD4 count <200 cells/μl or an AIDS-defining event within ±3 months of first positive HIV test) were analyzed in a random effects logistic regression model. Among 3,744 patients, 2,681 (72%) were late presenters. In the multivariable model, older patients were more likely to be late presenters than younger (≤30 years) patients [31-40, 41-50, and ≥51 years: odds ratio (OR) = 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-1.88; OR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.58-2.56; and OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.23-2.31, respectively; all p ≤ 0.001]. Injecting drug users (IDU) were more likely (OR = 2.15, 95% CI 1.42-3.27, p < 0.001) and those with homosexual HIV exposure were less likely (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.35-0.58, p < 0.001) to be late presenters compared to those with heterosexual HIV exposure. Females were less likely to be late presenters (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.36-0.53, p < 0.001). The year of first positive HIV test was not associated with late presentation. Efforts to reduce the patients who first seek HIV care at the late stage are needed. The identified risk factors associated with late presentation should be utilized in formulating targeted public health intervention to improve earlier entry into HIV care."
913,0.01,2.0000,"It is unclear why discordant immunologic and virologic responses occur during therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This study examined whether markers of immune activation and naive/memory lymphocyte subsets at study baseline could predict discordance between HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA and CD4+ lymphocyte responses at week 24 of antiretroviral therapy. Ten diverse, prospective antiretroviral studies with 1007 evaluable subjects were included. Subsets of subjects at increased risk for discordance were identified by recursive partitioning. The strongest predictor of more-favorable immunologic than virologic responses was a lower baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count. Weaker predictors in small subsets of subjects were fewer activated CD4+ lymphocytes and fewer CD8+ lymphocytes. Conversely, the strongest predictors of more-favorable virologic than immunologic responses were higher baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count and percentage. Additional predictors in some analyses were higher CD8+ lymphocyte count or percentage and lower HIV-1 RNA concentrations. Baseline markers of immune activation and naive/memory lymphocyte subsets had limited ability to predict subsequent discordance."
1688,0.01,2.0000,"To predict the probability of long-term viral suppression during treatment with zidovudine and lamivudine, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA values were retrospectively pooled for 1083 patients from six randomized, double-blind clinical trials. All analyses of HIV-1 RNA were obtained using the Roche Amplicor assay or its earlier prototype. Time to loss of response was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis; Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the influence of baseline variables. Among 523 patients with < or = 6 months of prior zidovudine treatment, the probability of HIV-1 RNA suppression below 400 copies/ml at 48 weeks was 71% in those with baseline HIV-1 RNA < 5000 copies/ml, but only 14% in those with HIV-1 RNA between 50,000 and 200,000 copies/ml. Among 560 patients with > 6 months of prior zidovudine treatment, the rates of sustained viral suppression were lower, but also significantly associated with the baseline HIV-1 RNA. Multivariate analyses showed no independent effect of CD4 cell count, age, sex, race, or CDC disease stage on the probability of sustained HIV-1 RNA suppression. When patients with < or = 6 months of prior therapy were stratified based on the magnitude of HIV-1 RNA nadir achieved during treatment, those who reached a nadir of < 400 copies/ml retained this response for significantly longer time periods than the ones who only achieved partial viral suppression. In conclusion, baseline HIV-1 RNA levels and the duration of prior zidovudine therapy strongly predict the antiretroviral efficacy of zidovudine/lamivudine. The baseline parameters should influence the choice of the antiretroviral regimen."
1404,0.01,2.0000,The importance of the reduction in hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels 4 and 12 weeks after starting peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin combination therapy has been reported to predict a sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients infected with HCV genotype 1. We conducted a multicenter study to validate this importance along with baseline predictive factors in this patient subpopulation.
9985,0.01,2.0000,"The objective of this study was to determine the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients infected through injecting drug use (injecting drug users, IDUs) compared to patients infected via other routes (non-IDUs). We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study of all HIV-infected patients who initiated HAART during the study period of 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2007. We compared changes in CD4(+) cell counts, percentage of full viral suppression (< 500 copies/ml) and mortality from start of HAART, as well as differences in initial HAART regimen. Three thousand six hundred and fifteen patients were included in the study, representing 22,804 person-y of observation. A total of 346 (9.6%) were categorized as IDUs. Of IDUs, 55% gained full viral control within the first y after HAART compared to 76% of non-IDUs (p = 0.0002). Absolute CD4(+) cell count and survival were lower for IDUs compared to non-IDUs (adjusted mortality rate ratio 3.6 (95% CI 2.9-4.3)). IDUs were more likely to receive a first regimen based on protease inhibitors (PIs) compared to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens for non-IDUs, and IDUs initiated HAART later than non-IDUs. In conclusion, more than half of the HIV-infected patients in Denmark infected through injecting drug use gained full viral suppression after initiating HAART. Absolute CD4(+) cell count was lower and mortality higher among IDUs than non-IDUs."
12757,0.01,2.0000,"In France a harm-reduction policy was implemented in the late 1980s with the aim of reducing the prevalence of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among drug users. The ANRS-Coquelicot survey was designed to measure the prevalence of HIV and HCV infection among drug users and to examine determinants of at-risk behaviors. In 2002, information was collected from 166 drug users recruited in all types of services specializing in drug use intervention and harm reduction in Marseille, France. Self-reported HIV and HCV serostatus was compared with the results of serological tests done on capillary blood collected on filter paper. The self-reported and biologically documented prevalence rates of HIV infection were identical (22%). In contrast, the self-reported prevalence of HCV infection was 52%, whereas the biologically documented prevalence was 73%. Overall, 30% of HCV-infected drug users were unaware of their status. Forty-four percent of drug users under 30 years of age were HCV seropositive, suggesting that they had been infected early during drug use. The harm-reduction policy seems to have had a marked impact on HIV transmission among drug users but a much more limited impact on HCV transmission. The limitations and implications of the study are discussed."
1865,0.01,2.0000,"Seeking ways to improve their health, gay men with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections living in San Francisco are developing information networks and patterns of self-care behavior. Drawing from a set of explanatory theories, this cross-sectional survey with retrospective elements examined patterns and potential predictors of information-seeking activity in a cohort or 162 HIV seropositive (HIV+) men, 60 of whom provided complete data sets. The study suggests that 1 year after becoming aware of an HIV+ health status, most patients have developed multifaceted information networks. The amount of tangible aid acquired from these networks and frequency of consultation is positively related to patterns of HIV self-care behaviors and ""feeling calm"" (p less than 0.01), suggesting that these variables may be important markers for the need of supportive-educative nursing care. Suggestions for nursing practice and research are also described."
17835,0.01,2.0000,"Neuromuscular manifestations, including a variety of peripheral neuropathies and myopathies, can occur either as isolated clinical phenomena or concurrently with other clinical manifestations, and are common in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). A 33-year-old male patient had a four-year history of increasing proximal muscle weakness of the extremities. Elevated muscle enzymes, a muscle biopsy and interstitial lung disease all suggested a diagnosis of polymyositis with lung involvement. However, a transbronchial lung biopsy revealed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and serology for HIV infection disclosed positive results. Zidovudine and cotrimoxazole were instituted and the patient improved. HIV-associated myopathy should be considered by practicing clinicians in cases presenting with myopathy, since the number of patients with HIV infection is increasing in Taiwan."
8635,0.01,2.0000,"Helper T-cell function was evaluated in 34 children infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1, by assessing interleukin-2 production after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with recall antigens (influenza virus, tetanus toxoid), allogeneic HLA, and phytohemagglutinin. In addition, helper T-cell function was correlated retrospectively with the incidence of opportunistic and bacterial infections. Four patterns of helper T-cell function were observed: (1) 7 (21%) of the 34 children responded to all stimuli, (2) 7 (21%) of them responded to alloantigens and phytohemagglutinin but not to recall antigens, (3) 7 (21%) responded to phytohemagglutinin but not to recall antigens or alloantigens, and (4) 13 (37%) did not respond to any of these stimuli. There were no significant differences related to different routes of acquisition among patients. Patients with functional helper T-cell defects had a history of more opportunistic (p = 0.03) and bacterial (p less than 0.001) infections than did patients with intact helper T-cell function. Thus distinct patterns of helper T-cell dysfunction exist in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and correlate with higher frequency of infections. Comparisons of in vitro helper T-cell responses to these stimuli may be useful for detecting early functional helper T-cell defects and for monitoring progression of disease."
16318,0.01,2.0000,"A recently developed transgenic mouse strain which expresses high levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) was studied as a model for evaluation of potential chemotherapeutic agents. Lamivudine ([-]2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine), known to reduce hepatitis B viremia in human patients, and zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine), previously shown to be ineffective for HBV infections in man, were used in parallel in this transgenic animal model. Orally administered lamivudine at dosages of 100, 50, and 25 mg/kg per day given once a day for 21 days significantly decreased serum and liver HBV DNA titers in a dose-responsive manner. Zidovudine (approximately 22 mg/kg per day) administered in the drinking water for 21 days was not effective in reducing these HBV parameters as compared to transgenic placebo-treated controls. The serum HBV DNA titers rebounded to high levels 1 week after cessation of lamivudine treatment. Male and female mice responded in a similar manner to these therapies. The results using this transgenic mouse model were similar to what would be predicted from treatment of HBV-infected human patients with lamivudine and zidovudine, and indicate these mice may be useful as a small animal chemotherapeutic model for study of potential HBV inhibitors."
4534,0.01,2.0000,"HIV-1 RNA levels as measured by two commercially available quantitative assays were compared before and during zidovudine treatment. HIV-1 RNA levels were measured in stored serum samples from 24 Dutch zidovudine-treated participants of a zidovudine efficacy study (European-Australian Collaborative Group Study 017) at weeks -3, 0, 4 and 8, using quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA; Organon Technika) and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Amplicor; Roche Molecular Systems). HIV-1 RNA copy numbers and changes from baseline as measured by each assay were compared. Individual responses to treatment were compared using definitions based on the within-subject variation of each assay. Before treatment, HIV-1 RNA levels as measured by NASBA were 0.49 logs higher than the levels measured by the Amplicor assay (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32-0.66). During treatment, this difference decreased significantly to 0.27 logs (95% CI 0.01-0.53; difference 0.22 logs; 95% CI 0.05-0.37). The smaller difference between the results of the two assays during treatment was a consequence of a larger decline in RNA level as measured by NASBA compared with that measured by the Amplicor assay (mean change after 4 weeks 0.77 and 0.49 logs, respectively). At week 8, the mean HIV-1 RNA level was still significantly below baseline values as measured by NASBA, but not when measured by the Amplicor assay. Discrepancies in individual responses as measured by the two assays were also observed. In conclusion, marked differences exist between the NASBA and Amplicor quantitative assays, in both HIV-1 RNA copy numbers without treatment and changes in RNA level during treatment. These differences should be considered in interpreting analyses of clinical trials and relationships between HIV-1 RNA level and clinical outcome, as well as in the use of RNA level in the management of HIV-infected patients."
13119,0.01,2.0000,"Among the 97 adult patients with acute hepatitis B who were admitted to the Toranomon Hospital in Metropolitan Tokyo during 28 years from 1976 to 2003, 31 (32%) were infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype A, nine (9%) with genotype B, 44 (45%) with genotype C, one (1%) each with genotypes E and F. HBV in the remaining 11 (11%) patients were untypeable. All the 31 patients with acute hepatitis B caused by HBV genotype A infection were male with a median age of 31 years, and 16 (52%) contracted infection through extramarital sexual contacts. The baseline HBV DNA level was higher in the seven (23%) patients in whom infection with HBV genotype A persisted than the remaining 24 (77%) with spontaneous resolution (median: >8.7 vs. 6.0 log genome equivalents/ml, P = 0.004). Persistent infection was more frequent in patients with maximum alanine aminotransferase <500 IU/L than > or =500 IU/L (83% [5/6] vs. 4% [1/25], P = 0.0001). Of the six patients with persistent HBV genotype A infection who received interferon and/or lamivuidine for treatment of chronic active hepatitis, three (50%) responded with the loss of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg); hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was cleared from serum in one patient who received interferon and lamivudine in sequence. HBV genotype A persisted along with HBeAg in the remaining three patients given antiviral therapy as well as another who was not treated. In conclusion, infection with HBV genotype A prevails in patients with acute hepatitis B in Japan where genotypes B and C are common, is often contracted sexually (16/31 [52%]) and tends to persist (7/31 [23%]). Infection was cleared in only one of the six (17%) patients who received antiviral therapy."
2545,0.01,2.0000,"Thirteen hemophilia centers provide comprehensive care to approximately 90 percent of persons with hemophilia in California. For 1987, these centers reported patient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody status, age group, level of clotting factor deficiency, and hemophilia type on 1,438 persons with hemophilia A and B; HIV serologic status was known for 860 persons (59.8 percent) of whom 537 (62.4 percent) were HIV-antibody-positive. The HIV positivity rate increased with age after taking into account hemophilia type, clotting factor level and treatment center type. The three-year cumulative incidence of reported AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) cases based on the number of HIV positive patients, was 11.6 percent. The cumulative incidence rate was 14.6 percent (54 of 370) for those patients over 20 years of age and 4.8 percent (8 of 167) for those under 21 years of age. Although a comparable distribution of the date of diagnoses of AIDS was seen by age group, there appeared to be a bimodal distribution in the rate of AIDS among the age groups, with the 6-12-year-olds and the 21 and older age groups showing higher incidence rates."
7994,0.01,2.0000,"Risk factors for and serologic evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were analyzed among 557 women. Study subjects were attending a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases and enrolled in a clinical trial of nonoxynol-9 prevention of gonococcal and chlamydial infections. Seventy-eight (14%) showed serologic evidence of past HBV infection. Only age at time of serum collection was significantly associated with HBV marker prevalence (P = 0.04). None of the four measures of sexual activity taken (number of sex partners per month, frequency of sexual intercourse, number of documented episodes of sexually transmitted diseases, and lifetime number of sexual partners) were significantly related to the presence of HBV markers. For each measure, however, differences observed between HBV positive and negative subjects were consistent with what would be expected if these factors did contribute to HBV infection risk. These results support the role of heterosexual transmission of HBV infection in women and are consistent with recommendations for hepatitis B immunization of heterosexually active persons with multiple sexual partners."
14033,0.01,2.0000,"The development of HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses during acute HIV-1 infection is associated with a dramatic decline in HIV-1 replication and the resolution of the acute retroviral syndrome. These HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells typically target a small number of viral epitopes in a distinct hierarchical order, and high-level viremia in chronic progressive infection leads to broadly diversified HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses with a less clear immunodominance pattern. It is argued here that the specific hierarchical pattern of immune responses in acute HIV-1 infection is the result of a tightly regulated process that, among other factors, is critically impacted by the kinetics of viral protein expression, the HLA class I background of the infected individual and the autologous sequence of the infecting virus."
9586,0.01,2.0000,"The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between intravenous (i.v) drug use practices and the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 146 heterosexual male i.v. drug users (IVDUs) attending a methadone-maintainance treatment program in Catanzaro, Southern Italy. One hundred and forty-six heterosexual male IVDUs attending a methadone-maintainance treatment program in Catanzaro were interviewed in order to obtain the following information: age, number of drug injections (calculated by multiplying the mean number of daily injections by 365 and then by the number of years of injections), number of injection equipment-sharing partners in the last year, number of sexual partners in the last year and possible IV cocaine use. Their sera were studied for the presence of antibodies to HIV, HBV and HCV by commercial enzyme-linked-immuno-sorbent assays run in duplicate. HIV positive samples were confirmed by Western Blot assay. Sixteen per cent of IVDUs were anti-HIV positive, 40% were anti-HBc positive and 68% were anti-HCV positive. Twenty-three per cent were seronegative and 12% were seropositive for all 3 viral markers. Multiple logistic analysis of HIV, HBV and HCV seropositivities in relation to age, number of drug injections, i.v. cocaine use and presence of injection equipment-sharing partners in the last year, showed that: a) older age (more than 27 years) was significantly associated with all 3 viral infections (mainly with HIV); b) i.v. cocaine use was associated with HBV, but even more with HIV; c) injection equipment-sharing partners in the last year was directly associated with HCV and inversely with HIV. No significant association was observed with the number of drug injections and the number of sexual partners. In conclusion, this study: a) demonstrates a difference of prevalence for HIV, HBV and HCV serum markers in this group of IVDUs from Catanzaro, Southern Italy; b) underlines the importance of i.v. cocaine use in the spreading of HIV; c) emphasizes the need of preventive strategies."
6999,0.01,2.0000,"The direct measurement of the incidence of new infections with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be made among soldiers because of the routine and periodic nature of HIV-1 testing in the United States Army. Between November 1985 and October 1993, 978 HIV-1 seroconversions were seen among 1,061,768 soldiers, contributing over 3.6 million person-years of follow-up [seroconversion rate (95% confidence interval) = 0.27/1,000 person-years (0.25-0.29)]. A significant decreasing trend in HIV-1 seroconversion rates was seen over the analysis period. The rate of new infections declined significantly from the first interval, 1985-1987, (0.43/1,000 person-years) to the second interval, 1987-1988, (0.28/1,000 person-years), but stabilized at approximately 0.22/1,000 person-years after 1988, representing new infections in approximately 100-150 soldiers annually. The risk of seroconversion among active duty soldiers was significantly associated with racial/ethnic group, age, gender, and marital status. Surveillance of HIV-1 seroconversion rates in the U.S. Army continues to offer a unique opportunity to assess temporal trends in the evolving HIV-1 infection epidemic. Monitoring the rate of new HIV-1 infections allows for identification of subgroups in need of intervention, refocusing of intervention strategies, and evaluation of their effectiveness."
2017,0.01,2.0000,"The aim of the present study was to assess the pharmacokinetic behavior of atazanavir-ritonavir when it is coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Eleven patients enrolled in Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le SIDA (National Agency for AIDS Research, Paris, France) trial 107 were included in this pharmacokinetic study. They received atazanavir at 300 mg and ritonavir at 100 mg once a day (QD) from day 1 to the end of study. For the first 2 weeks, their nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatments remained unchanged. Tenofovir DF was administered QD from day 15 to the end of the study. Ongoing NRTIs were selected according to the reverse transcriptase genotype of the HIV isolates from each patient. The values of the pharmacokinetic parameters for atazanavir and ritonavir were measured before (day 14 [week 2]) and after (day 42 [week 6]) initiation of tenofovir DF and are reported for the 10 patients who completed the study. There was a significant decrease in the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC(0-24)) for atazanavir with the addition of tenofovir DF (AUC(0-24) ratio, 0.75; 90% confidence interval, 0.58 to 0.97; P = 0.05). There was a trend for a decrease in the minimum concentrations of atazanavir and ritonavir in plasma when they were combined with tenofovir, but none of the differences reached statistical significance. The median decreases in the HIV RNA loads at week 2 and week 6 were 0.1 and 0.2 log copies/ml, respectively. In summary, our data are consistent with the existence of a significant interaction between atazanavir and tenofovir DF."
18294,0.01,2.0000,"Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), the first nucleotidic inhibitor of HIV reverse transcription, became available in 2001. It has been extensively used worldwide and is now the most prescribed antiretroviral (ARV) drug. Its high antiviral activity and favorable metabolic profile are responsible for its success. Furthermore, TDF has been associated with other ARVs to form new combined antiretroviral treatments in only one tablet once-a-day, which increases treatment adherence. Fears of potential nephrotoxicity that tenofovir would have in common with two other drugs from the same family (adefovir, used to treat hepatitis B, and cidofovir, used to treat cytomegalovirus infections) were alleviated by the early clinical trials. Yet, in 2001, the first case of TDF-induced acute nephrotoxicity was published. Numerous cases have been published since then, and it is now established that TDF presents a tubular toxicity risk. Some facilitating factors have been identified, such as co-prescription of didanosine or boosted protease inhibitor, preexisting CKD, low body weight, and associated diabetes mellitus. Conversely, whether TDF is nephrotoxic in the long term is a highly debated question. Some studies suggest a decreased GFR when TDF is prescribed for a long period, while others indicate that TDF is safe for the kidneys even after many years of use. Here we review the differences in patient characteristics, study designs, and measured outcomes that can possibly explain these conflicting findings. We conclude with rational recommendation for appropriate TDF prescription. "

Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection attending secondary and tertiary care centres in Switzerland. One thousand six hundred and forty-five patients with HCV infection were followed up for a mean of over 2 years. We calculated all-cause standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using age, sex and calendar year-specific Swiss all-cause mortality rates. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to model the variability of SMR by cirrhotic status, HCV genotype, infection with hepatitis B virus or HIV, injection drug use and alcohol intake. Sixty-one deaths were recorded out of 1645 participants. The crude all-cause SMR was 4.5 (95% CI: 3.5-5.8). Patients co-infected with HIV had a crude SMR of 20 (95% CI: 11.1-36.1). The SMR of 1.1 (95% CI: 0.63-2.03) for patients who were not cirrhotic, not infected with HBV or HIV, did not inject drugs, were not heavy alcohol consumers (<or=40 g/day) and were not genotype 3, indicated no strong evidence of excess mortality. We found little evidence of excess mortality in hepatitis C infected patients who were not cirrhotic, in the absence of selected risk factors. Our findings emphasize the importance of providing appropriate preventive advice, such as counselling to avoid alcohol intake, in those infected with HCV."

In this study we aimed to examine the regulation of NGAL in HIV infection. The regulation of NGAL in HIV infection was examined by different experimental approaches, including studies in peripheral blood and mononuclear cells (MNC) from bone marrow aspirates before and during highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). We found that: before initiating HAART, HIV-infected patients (n = 37) had significantly decreased serum NGAL levels compared with healthy controls (n = 26); (ii) during HAART, there was a gradual and significant increase in NGAL concentrations reaching levels comparable to those in healthy controls after 12 months; (iii) this increase was seen primarily in virological responders to HAART (HIV RNA level <200 copies/ml after 24 months); (iv) phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated NGAL release in MNC cells from bone marrow aspirates was decreased in untreated HIV-infected patients compared with healthy controls, but increased after 26 weeks on HAART; and (v) there was a significant positive correlation between neutrophil counts and NGAL levels at all time-points during HAART. We have shown decreased NGAL levels in HIV-infected patients, potentially reflecting decreased number and function of neutrophils as well as impaired bone marrow myelopoiesis. These abnormalities were reversed by successful HAART. Our findings underscore further the involvement of neutrophils and innate immunity in HIV-related immunodeficiency."
17169,0.01,2.0000,"Occupational exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has led to a low but finite incidence of infection among health care providers. In such circumstances, postexposure administration of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine; AZT) might be beneficial. To test this possibility, the SCID-hu mouse (the immunodeficient C.B-17 scid/scid mouse engrafted with human hematolymphoid organs) was treated with AZT at different times after intravenous infection with a standard dose of HIV (known to infect 100% of animals). If given within 2 h, AZT suppressed infection in all animals; if given after 2 days, no suppression was observed. At least in some animals, an AZT-sensitive phase lasted for as long as 36 h. These data support the hypothesis that prompt administration of AZT might be efficacious in suppressing acute HIV infection in humans. Further studies in the SCID-hu mouse might provide insight into treatment protocols of even greater efficacy."
3560,0.01,2.0000,"Optimal management of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections may require combinations of anti-HIV-1 agents. Zidovudine (AZT, 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine), didanosine (ddI, 2',3'-dideoxyinosine), and recombinant interferon-alpha A (rIFN-alpha A) were evaluated in two-drug regimens against replication of AZT-resistant HIV-1 in vitro. AZT-sensitive and AZT-resistant isolate pairs derived from two individuals before and after extended AZT monotherapy were studied. Drug interactions using peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with HIV-1 were evaluated mathematically. Synergistic interactions were seen among AZT, ddI, and rIFN-alpha A in two-drug regimens against AZT-resistant HIV-1 in vitro, even when AZT was included in the treatment regimen. Mixtures of wild-type and mutant reverse transcriptase genes were found in one of the late-AZT therapy isolates, suggesting that the mechanism of synergy of AZT-containing regimens may involve inhibition of AZT-sensitive viruses in the viral pool. These studies suggest that AZT may be useful in drug combination regimens, even when AZT-resistant viruses are isolated in vitro."
3242,0.01,2.0000,"In vitro activities, against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)- and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected cells, of four amphiphilic heterodinucleoside phosphates containing 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) or 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) as antiviral monomers were evaluated. The four compounds were N4-hexadecyl-2'-deoxyribocytidylyl-(3'-->5')-3'-azido-2',3'-deoxyt hymidine (N4-hxddC-AZT), N4-palmitoyl-2'-deoxyribocytidylyl-(3'-->5')-3'-azido-2',3'-deoxyt hymidine (N4-pamdC-AZT), N4-hexadecyl-2'-deoxycytidylyl-(3'-->5')-2',3'-dideoxycytidine (N4-hxddC-ddC) and 2'-deoxythymidylyl-(3'-->5')-N4-palmitoyl-2',3'-dideoxycytidine (dT-N4-pamddC). All four dimers were active against HIV, dT-N4-pamddC being the most active and least toxic. dT-N4-pamddC also exhibited strong antiviral effects against a panel of eight AZT-resistant HIV strains. The ddC-containing heterodimers incorporated in liposomes additionally inhibited HBV replication by 50-80% in HepG2 2.2.15 cells. AZT and the AZT-containing dimers were ineffective. Differences in pharmacokinetic properties between the antiviral monomers and the heterodimers were evaluated using liposomal formulations of 3H-labelled AZT heterodimers as model compounds. The cellular distribution of AZT in H9 cells was predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas the amphiphilic dimers were distributed more evenly throughout the cytoplasm, nuclear membranes and microsomes. Blood levels of the heterodimers decreased at a rate two- to threefold slower than AZT and the areas-under-the-curves were five- to sevenfold higher for N4-pamdC-AZT and N4-hxddC-AZT, respectively. Compared to AZT, the peak levels of the dimers were three to four times higher in blood and five to six times higher in the liver. Analysis of blood samples showed that 34% of N4-pamdC-AZT was metabolized to AZT, whereas only 9% of N4-hxddC-AZT released AZT. Considering the antiviral potency and the favourable pharmacokinetic properties of the heterodimers, these compounds merit further exploration as antiviral drugs."
19581,0.01,2.0000,"Previous studies have shown that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exploits dendritic cells (DC) to replicate and spread among CD4(+) T cells. To explain the predominance of non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) over syncytium-inducing (SI) strains during the initial viremia of HIV, we investigated the ability of blood monocyte (Mo)-derived DC to transmit HIV-1 to CD4(+) cells of the monocytoid lineage. First, we demonstrate that in our system, DC are able to transmit NSI strains, but not SI strains, of HIV-1 to fresh blood Mo and to Mo-derived macrophages (MDM). To establish a productive infection, a 10-fold-lower amount of virus was necessary for DC-mediated transmission of HIV-1 to Mo than in case of cell-free infection. Second, immature CD83(-) DC (imDC) transmit virus to Mo and MDM with higher efficacy compared to mature CD83(+) DC (maDC); this finding is in contrast to data previously obtained with CD4(+) T cells. Third, maturation from imDC to maDC efficiently silenced expression of beta2-integrins CD11b, CD11c, and CD18 by maDC. Moreover, monoclonal antibody against CD18 inhibited transmission of HIV-1 from imDC to Mo. We propose that the adhesion molecules of the CD11/CD18 family, involved in cell-cell interactions of DC with the microenvironment, may play a major role in imDC-mediated HIV-1 infection of Mo and MDM."
1166,0.01,2.0000,"Lung involvement in patients affected by HIV-1 infection is characterized by an alveolitis sustained by the accumulation of CD8+ T lymphocytes. To investigate whether in situ T cell growth plays a relevant role in the pooling of CD8+ lymphocytes, we have analyzed the activity of two lymphokines involved in the mechanisms of T cell proliferation, i.e., interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-4. To this aim, following appropriate triggering and blocking, the expression and the functional role of IL-2 receptors (IL-2R) (both p55 and p75 chains) and IL-4 receptors have been analyzed on T lymphocytes obtained from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of 16 HIV-1+ patients. Molecular and phenotypic studies we performed demonstrated that CD8+ lymphocytes from the BAL of HIV-1 + patients strongly expressed the p75 chain of IL-2 receptor, while neither p55 mRNA nor its surface membrane product (Tac antigen) was detectable; in addition, there was no expression of IL-4 receptors. IL-2 stimulation was able to induce T cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, whereas IL-4 did not. Finally, using mAbs which specifically block the p55 or p75 IL-2R, we showed that both subunits of IL-2R were involved in the proliferative activity of lung lymphocytes. The results obtained in the present study directly demonstrate that BAL T lymphocytes of HIV-1 + patients express a fully functional IL-2 receptor apparatus, pointing to the role for this lymphokine in maintaining the alveolitis taking place in the lungs of AIDS patients."
19481,0.01,2.0000,"Forty-six patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus infection were followed between 6 and 116 mo (mean = 32.8 mo; median = 24 mo). Nineteen patients (41%) demonstrated clinical courses with episodes of biochemical reactivation (ALT levels greater than or equal to 10 times baseline values [group A]). Twenty-seven patients (59%) had stable clinical courses without biochemical reactivation (group B). Patients in group A were younger than those in group B (30.5 vs. 35.3 yr; p = 0.03), were less likely to be intravenous drug abusers (16% vs. 52%; p = 0.01) and were more likely to be homosexual (58% vs. 22%; p = 0.01). Serum hepatitis B virus DNA, hepatitis delta virus RNA, IgM antibody to HBc, HBeAg, antibody to HBe and IgG and IgM antibody to hepatitis delta virus were measured in all patients. In group A, these markers were studied before and during reactivation and during remission. In group B, these parameters were studied in a random fashion at 7- to 10-mo intervals. The presence of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus was assessed in all patients. A total of 38 biochemical reactivation episodes was noted among the 19 patients in group A. Eleven had sequential changes in hepatitis delta virus markers, suggesting that the exacerbations were due to hepatitis delta virus. In three, the sequential changes of viral markers were consistent with the exacerbations due to hepatitis B virus. In five other patients, no sequential changes in viral markers could be demonstrated to correlate with the biochemical exacerbations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
19186,0.01,2.0000,"The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected patients has been associated with the development of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CD) including dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia being the most frequent metabolic disturbance in these patients. Fibrates are indicated when hypertriglyceridemia is accentuated and persists for over six months. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of bezafibrate for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in HIV-infected individuals on HAART. All patients received 400mg/day of bezafibrate and were evaluated three times: Mo (pre-treatment), M1 (one month after treatment), and M2 (six months after treatment). Fifteen adult individuals, eight males and seven females with mean age = 41.2 +/- 7.97 years and triglyceride serum levels > 400mg/dL were included in the study. Smoking, alcohol ingestion and sedentarism rates were 50%, 6.66% and 60%, respectively. Family history of CD, hypertension and diabetes mellitus was reported in 33.3%, 40% and 46.7% of the cases, respectively, while dyslipidemia was reported by only 13.3%. More than half of the patients were using a protease inhibitor plus a nucleotide analog transcriptase inhibitor. Eutrophy and tendency toward overweight were observed at all three study time points. There were significant reductions in triglyceride serum levels from Mo to M1 and from Mo to M2. No significant changes were observed in the serum levels of creatine phosphokinase, hepatic enzymes, CD4+, CD8+ and viral load. Therefore, bezafibrate seems to be safe and effective for the reduction of hypertriglyceridemia in HIV-infected patients on HAART."
4913,0.01,2.0000,"Quantitation of HIV in 115 seropositive individuals was undertaken to evaluate the potential for HIV transmission as a nosocomial infection through the use of medical devices that may come in contact with the peripheral blood of HIV-infected individuals. The virus burden in the peripheral blood was estimated from the level of: plasma HIV p24 antigenemia; plasma viremia; p24 antigen in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) lysates as indicators of productive infection; and frequency of latently infected cells. Negligible HIV levels were observed in the plasma and PBMC lysates of the majority of samples except for late-stage patients with certain opportunistic infections and/or lack of zidovudine (AZT) therapy. Some individuals on AZT therapy and at late-stage of disease may show antigenemia without plasma viremia or alternatively, plasma viremia may be observed without plasma antigenemia. PBMC lysate data indicated that the frequency of productively infected cells was less than one in 20,000 PBMCs for the majority of samples irrespective of status on AZT therapy or disease stage. HIV was detected in greater than 95% of the cocultures and within 14 days for most of the samples, again regardless of the stage of disease or status on AZT therapy. The frequency of latently infected cells in this cohort ranged from 125 to 3125 per million PBMCs and was calculated to be as high as 2.5% of the helpter T-cell (CD4+ cell) population in the peripheral blood. The average latently infected cell frequency was 2-3-fold higher in early stage patients not on AZT than in late-stage patients on AZT therapy."
14135,0.01,2.0000,"A nonselective ex vivo assay was used to directly detect and quantify zidovudine (AZT)-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the blood of treated and untreated patients. In contrast to previous reports, drug-resistant virus was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a few of the patients who had never received AZT. The AZT resistance of HIV-1 isolates from one untreated individual was confirmed by further susceptibility studies in vitro and by the finding of a characteristic mutation (Lys-->Arg at codon 70) in the reverse transcriptase. In patients who were clinically stable while on AZT, HIV-1 titers in plasma and mononuclear cells were generally low but resistant viruses already predominated. In those individuals who were deteriorating despite AZT administration, high levels of viremia were observed, and the resistance phenotype was nearly universal. These findings serve to emphasize the magnitude of the AZT-resistance problem in patients on drug treatment."
13347,0.01,2.0000,"With the advent of potent combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), there has been a reduction in the incidence of wasting. However, few studies have investigated specific body composition changes associated with these treatments. This study aimed to investigate longitudinally the association of increasingly potent ART with changes in body cell mass and wasting utilizing bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA). In this longitudinal cohort study, 159 HIV-positive men were assessed semiannually from 1995 to 1997 for body composition utilizing BIA, CD4 lymphocyte count, HIV viral load, medical and depressive symptoms. Wasting was defined as body cell mass/height below the 90th percentile based on HIV positive norms. ART potency at each visit was scored utilizing published clinical guidelines, ranging from 1 (0-1 antiretrovirals) to 5 (3 or more antiretrovirals including a potent protease inhibitor). Viral resistance testing was not used. The mixed-effects model and the generalized estimating equations approaches were used to determine longitudinal correlates of body cell mass and of wasting, respectively. Over the 2 years of follow-up, potent combination ART use increased from 6% to 79%. Concurrently, a significant increase in mean body cell mass and a reduction in prevalence of wasting were seen, while total body weight, fat mass, and total body water did not change. Increasingly potent ART was associated with significant increases in body cell mass and reduction in wasting. Other significant correlates of increased body cell mass included higher CD4 count and decreased severity of HIV-related symptoms, fatigue and depression. The current study found that higher potency ART taken for relatively short term (2 years) was associated with an increase in body cell mass and a reduction in wasting and that these changes were associated with both medical (CD4, HIV symptoms) and behavioral (fatigue, depression) improvements. One caveat is this study did not distinguish among types of potent ART regimens. Given only some antiretrovirals appear linked to many body composition changes, regardless of their effect on viral load, it may be the type of regimen used that accounted for the relationship seen between viral load and body composition changes."
8880,0.01,2.0000,"Using data from TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD), this paper aims to assess the rate of, and factors associated with the diagnosis of new AIDS-defining illness (ADI) within 90 days after antiretroviral treatment. Patients starting three or more antiretroviral combinations and having subsequent follow-up were included. New ADI cases were checked for evidence of immune reconstitution syndrome (IRS). Among the 1185 patients included, 75 (6.3%) were diagnosed with a new ADI within 90 days, giving a rate of 26.8/100 person-years, compared with a further 3.6% cumulative incidence of new ADI between 90 days to one year (4.2/100 person-years). Of the 75 patients, 21 were judged as definitive or presumptive IRS, giving a rate of 7.3/100 person-years. Patients with new ADI generally had lower CD4 counts before treatment started (median, 43 cells/microL). Lower CD4 count, lower body mass index and starting treatment in the same year as the first HIV-positive test done were associated with developing a new ADI. The higher rate of new ADI within 90 days may be partly explained by IRS occurring shortly after treatment. Although it is difficult to identify IRS from observational data, it appears that in TAHOD setting IRS was relatively uncommon."
229,0.01,2.0000,"Central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities are significant and frequent complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in infants and children. Although the predominant cause of neurological and neuropsychological abnormalities appears to be related to HIV infection of the CNS, other factors including malnutrition may also play a role. We retrospectively evaluated the association of change in body weight with changes in neurocognitive function, ventricular brain ratio, and cerebrospinal quinolinic acid levels in a small cohort of children (n=15; mean age 6.3 years) with symptomatic HIV-1 disease before and after 6 months of antiretroviral therapy with continuous intravenous infusion of zidovudine (ZVD). Significant increases in weight and neurocognitive function as well as decreases in ventricular brain ratio and cerebrospinal quinolinic acid levels were noted after therapy. Only the relation between increase in weight and decrease in ventricular brain ratio was statistically significant (P< .01); contrary to expectations, an increase in weight seemed to correlate with a decrease in neurocognitive function (NS). Another group of children treated at the same time with oral intermittent ZVD, but otherwise receiving the same care did not show the same magnitude of improvement in neurocognitive function. These results seem to suggest that general supportive and medical care as well as nutritional factors may only play a limited role in the neurocognitive improvements after antiretroviral therapy with continuous infusion ZVD. Our sample size was, however, small and the nutritional measure rather global; thus these findings have to be considered as very preliminary."
5949,0.01,2.0000,"Longitudinal investigations of an adult male population of Kenyan car washers who have heavy and quantifiable occupational exposure to Schistosoma mansoni cercariae revealed that some individuals develop resistance to reinfection while others remain highly susceptible. We sought to characterize immune correlates associated with host protection in this population. Previous studies have demonstrated an association of peripheral eosinophilia with resistance to reinfection with schistosomes. Thus, we investigated the relationship between the percentage of circulating eosinophils and the effect of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coinfection on the susceptibility of the car washers to reinfection with schistosomes. Elevated percentages of circulating eosinophils were associated with resistance to reinfection by S. mansoni in HIV-1-seronegative persons. In the HIV-1-seropositive cohort, low CD4+-T-cell counts were associated with a less intense eosinophilia. Moreover, eosinophils from the car washers expressed high levels of FcepsilonRI beta chain, a molecule important in immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated immunity. Levels of FcepsilonRI beta chain expression correlated with serum levels of total and antigen-specific IgE for HIV-1-negative car washers, but this was not the case for individuals coinfected with HIV-1. Overall, these data further implicate eosinophils as having a potential role in development of protective immunity against schistosomes and suggest that changes associated with HIV-1 coinfection increase susceptibility to reinfection."
927,0.01,2.0000,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) have the highest incidence of HIV infection in the United States. One of the contributing factors to HIV spread among this group is the use of crystal methamphetamine (""meth""). The objective was to review the behavioral impact of crystal meth use in HIV-infected MSM and potential treatment options. A systematic review of MEDLINE identified studies that evaluated the clinical effects of crystal meth on the HIV-infected MSM population. Search terms included HIV, methamphetamine, MSM, antiretroviral therapy, adherence, resistance, and treatment. U.S. citations in the English language in peer-reviewed journals until December 2010 were included. The primary author reviewed eligible articles, and relevant data including study design, sample, and outcomes were entered into an electronic data table. The 61 included studies highlight that HIV-infected MSM who use crystal meth are more likely to report high-risk sexual behaviors, incident sexually transmitted infections, and serodiscordant unprotected anal intercourse, compared to HIV-infected MSM who do not use crystal meth. Medication adherence in this population is notably low, which may contribute to transmission of resistant virus. No medications have proven effective in the treatment of crystal meth addiction, and the role of behavioral therapies, such as contingency management are still in question. HIV-infected MSM who abuse crystal meth have worse HIV-related health outcomes. Behavioral interventions have shown variable results in treating crystal meth addiction, and more investigation into rehabilitation options are needed. The results presented support efforts to develop and implement novel interventions to reduce crystal meth use in HIV-infected MSM."

To determine the nature of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 population transmitted to women during heterosexual contact, we examined the diversity of the proviral envelope gene in infected cells in both genital secretions and peripheral blood from six recently seroconverted Kenyan women. Heterogeneous virus populations were present in cervical secretions and/or peripheral blood shortly after seroconversion for five of six infected individuals, and tissue-specific variants were identified in several cases."
5808,0.01,2.0000,"Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with multiple immunomodulating properties. Since NSAID's are used frequently for symptom control and, without proven efficacy, for immunopotentiation by people with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, we investigated the effects of indomethacin on T-cell lymphocyte subsets in HIV-seropositive subjects. Ten asymptomatic HIV-seropositive men participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over pilot study to determine effects of indomethacin on their CD4 ('helper') and CD8 ('suppressor') cell counts. Each subject received four weeks of drug and four weeks of placebo (or vice versa) separated by a two-week washout period. No statistically significant changes were seen in absolute CD4 or CD8 cell counts, although a modest decrease (16%) in CD8 counts occurred. These findings do not support the colloquial use of NSAID's as 'boosters' of CD4 cell counts."
16189,0.01,2.0000,"Readiness for therapy of people living with HIV is of major importance in the process of antiretroviral decision making. This qualitative study is part of a prospective multicentre investigation describing readiness for antiretroviral therapy (ART) and decision making in HIV-infected patients. The qualitative results present the daily experiences of people living with HIV in the treatment decision making process related to starting or changing ART. Based on a critical hermeneutic research design, interviews with twelve persons have been conducted. Two main categories were generated: ""dealing with oneself and others"" and ""understanding and being understood"". They describe the dialectical process of decision making with a focus on interactions with others. This process includes four themes: illness beliefs, health perspectives, therapy beliefs, life perspectives. The findings of this study reveal that partnerships of health care providers with HIV-infected patients are necessary for treatment decisions. Moreover; it is of major importance for health care providers to include patients' experiences and expertise and to allow time for the different dialogues."
16033,0.01,2.0000,"To characterize human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) strains circulating in the Northern region of Colombia in South America, sequences of the viral envelope C2V3C3 region were obtained from patients with different high-risk practices. Close to 60% of the sequences were predicted to belong to macrophage-tropic viruses, according to the positions of acidic amino acids and putative N-linked glycosylation sites. This is in agreement with the fact that most of the patients were recently diagnosed individuals. Phylogenic analysis then allowed assignment of all 35 samples to subtype B viruses. This same subtype was found in previous studies carried out in other Colombian regions. This study thus expands previous analyses with previously missing data from the Northern region of the country. The number and the length of the sequences examined also help to provide a clearer picture of the prevailing situation of the present HIV epidemics in this country."
3730,0.01,2.0000,"Progranulin (PGRN) is implicated in infection, immunity and host defense, but its role in the pathogenesis of HBV infection remains unknown. Here we investigated whether there is dysregulated production and the clinical significance of circulating PGRN in patients with chronic HBV infection. Serum concentrations of PGRN were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum PGRN levels were significantly higher in patients with chronic HBV infection than healthy subjects. PGRN levels were significantly associated with HBV-DNA levels, but did not correlate with the concentrations of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. This study demonstrates increased circulating PGRN production and association between PGRN levels and viral loads in patients with chronic HBV infection, suggesting a functional role of PGRN in the pathogenesis of HBV infection."
19265,0.01,2.0000,"Efavirenz, a potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase, is a promising addition to the antiretroviral armamentarium. Efavirenz levels and HIV-1 RNA levels were measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of 10 HIV-1-infected patients taking efavirenz, 600 mg daily, in combination with other antiretroviral medications. Efavirenz was detected in the CSF at a mean concentration of 35.1 nM (range, 6. 6-58.9 nM), which was above the IC95 for wild-type HIV-1. The mean CSF-to-plasma ratio was 0.61% (range, 0.26%-0.99%). CSF HIV-1 RNA levels were ascertained in 9 of the patients; all were <400 copies/mL after a mean of 26 weeks on therapy. Eight of the 9 patients had no detectable virus in plasma. These results indicate that efavirenz is present in the CSF at low levels and is effective in suppressing CSF viral levels when used in combination therapy."
9518,0.01,2.0000,"At Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, 270 consecutive patients at the dermatology and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic were enrolled in a study to evaluate the association of clinical STD syndromes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Female patients became sexually active earlier than male patients and were younger at marriage. Persons with a history of an STD during the preceding 5 years were more likely to be HIV infected (43%) than those without such a history (26%; OR 2.08, 95% C.I. 1.17, 3.73). Examination at the time of the visit demonstrated an association between genital ulcers and HIV infection in male and female patients (OR 2.21, 95% C.I. 1.08, 4.53, and OR 8.54, 95% C.I. 1.45, 87.55, respectively) but no association between HIV and urethritis or vaginal discharge. The etiologic fraction for HIV infection of genital ulcers was 0.218. Men with a history of contact with prostitutes were more likely to be HIV infected than those without contact (50% versus 28%, p less than 0.05), but once controlled for STDs, this relationship was no longer significant. This study confirms other studies from East Africa that have shown a relationship between genital ulcers and HIV infection. This finding, in the presence of no association between other STD syndromes and HIV infection, suggests that genital ulcers may be truly associated with HIV infection rather than a marker of high-risk activities."
11007,0.01,2.0000,"We have examined cell-free viral populations in the blood plasma and seminal plasma compartments of men infected with subtype C human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) using the V3-specific heteroduplex tracking assay (V3-HTA). We studied two cohorts of subjects who had visited either a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic for genital tract inflammation in the form of urethritis (n = 43) or a dermatology clinic (controls, n = 14) in Malawi. We have previously shown that the presence of urethritis is associated with an eightfold increase in virus load in the seminal plasma compartment (M. S. Cohen et al., Lancet 349:1868-1873, 1997). The purpose of this study was to determine whether genital tract inflammation and its treatment caused genetic instability in cell-free HIV-1 populations. In a cross-sectional analysis at study entry, three-fourths of the STD and control subjects had multiple V3 populations in their blood while 60% of the STD subjects and 79% of the control subjects had multiple V3 populations in their semen. Overall, one-fourth of all of the subjects showed discordance between results with blood and semen specimens when samples were compared for the presence and absence of subpopulations. When differences in the relative levels of abundance of bands were also taken into account, two-fifths of all of the subjects showed discordance between the compartments. Among the subset of subjects in whom multiple virus populations could be detected, half showed discordance between the compartments. There were no differences between STD and control cohorts for these comparisons of the compartments in this cross-sectional analysis at study entry. Longitudinal analysis of the viral populations from two separate clinic visits over 1 to 4 weeks showed that the complexity of each V3 population as measured by Shannon entropy was different in blood and semen at the two time points, indicating that the blood and semen constitute different compartments for HIV-1. The seminal plasma compartment was more dynamic than the blood plasma compartment for the STD subjects who were treated for urethritis, with changes being noted in the presence or absence of V3-HTA bands in the semen of 29% of these subjects but in the blood of only 9% of these subjects. However, the changes were generally small. Overall, our results suggest that 40% of male subjects show discordance between seminal and blood viral populations and that the complexity of each V3 population was different between the two compartments. Both of these results point to the partial independence of the seminal compartment as a viral niche within the body."
8631,0.01,2.0000,"It has been shown that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is closely associated with mixed type cryoglobulinaemia. It is also known that HCV infection is rampant among chronic haemodialysis patients. We studied 531 renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis including 170 with positive HCV antibodies for cryoglobulinaemia, and its incidence was compared with controls which consisted of 242 chronic hepatitis C patients without renal failure and 183 healthy adults. Cryoglobulinaemia was present in 30.6% of dialysis patients with HCV infection, 10.8% of dialysis patients without HCV infection, 29.8% of patients with chronic hepatitis C without renal failure, and 0% of healthy adults. Among the 30 new renal failure patients who were started on dialysis within 6 months, four were positive for HCV antibodies, and one of them had cryoglobulinaemia; of the 26 HCV-negative patients, four (15%) were cryoglobulinaemic. The cryocrit values among dialysis patients were much lower than those of the control cases and other reports on non-dialysis cases. Patients with cryoglobulinaemia were generally younger compared with patients negative for this condition. There was no correlation between cryoglobulinaemia and past blood transfusion, underlying disease or length of dialysis. Cryoglobulinaemic patients seem to develop renal failure at relatively young ages and a considerable proportion of cryoglobulinaemic dialysis patients may have already had cryoglobulinaemia at the time of the start of haemodialysis. There was no indication that the presence of cryoglobulin in serum adversely affects the liver disease nor increases serum virus load in HCV-infected dialysis patients. Thus, it was concluded that although HCV infection has a certain role in the development of cryoglobulinaemia in dialysis patients, they develop cryoglobulinaemia less frequently and produce cryoglobulin to a lesser degree in the presence of HCV infection as compared with non-dialysis patients."
16829,0.01,2.0000,"Ninety-nine sequential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 28 human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-infected patients were analyzed during the follow-up of 9 months to 4 years. Intrathecal synthesis of HIV-antibodies and IgG (p < 0.01), and the levels of beta-2-microglobulin (beta 2m) in the CSF (p < 0.05) and serum (p < 0.01) increased with duration of HIV-1 infection. No effect of duration of HIV-1 infection was observed on the individual CSF white cell counts and the levels of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability. In 13 patients with HIV-1-associated central nervous system (CNS) disease, the effect of duration was seen as an increase of the individual beta 2m levels in serum (p < 0.01). Moreover, 7 of 9 patients who developed neurological disease or showed its progression during the study increased the level of beta 2m in the CSF. All of them increased the level of beta 2m in serum. In 15 neurologically healthy subjects, the effect of duration was expressed as an increase of the level of individual beta 2m in CSF (p < 0.05) and intrathecal IgG synthesis (p < 0.01). In the AIDS group, the level of beta 2m in the CSF increased, but in less severe stages the dependency of the individual CSF parameters on disease duration was not found. Our results indicate that elevated levels of beta 2m in CSF and serum appear to predict progression of neurological and systemic diseases, respectively. Elevated beta 2m in the CSF of clinically intact individuals may indicate subclinical neurological disease caused by HIV-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
19024,0.01,2.0000,"Sexually transmissible diseases (STD), caused by viruses are by far the most important ones, even though German legislation has ignored them up to now as STD. Anogenital herpes is easily diagnosed by means of monoclonal antibodies. This makes therapy available with acyclovir without delay in atypical cases or for example in persons with immunodeficiency. The therapy regimen usually is 5 x 200-400 mg/day. Recurrent herpes in high frequency and with severe pain may be successfully suppressed by 2-5 x 200 mg/day of acyclovir orally without serious side effects. This will not eliminate herpes viruses. Anogenital warts may look very different and occasionally cannot be detected before local application of 3% acetic acid. Histology is diagnostic. There are different strains causing diseases in men. Therapy of choice is destroying infected cells by CO2-laser coagulation. The incidence of hepatitis B in developed countries is decreasing slowly within the past years, this may partly be due to vaccines, that are available since the early eighties, producing immunity in about 95%. Treatment of chronic hepatitis with interferons seems to be beneficial. Infections with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and their end stage disease AIDS are a growing problem all over the world. Interventions are possible with different nucleoside analogs, e. g. zidovudine (AZT), dideoxycytidine (DDC), dideoxyinosine (DDI). Up to now there is no agreement on when to start with one of the drugs and if or when to switch to combination therapy. Hopefully this may stabilize immunologic parameters and hold disease progression to some time."
10057,0.01,2.0000,"The complement system which is a critical mediator of innate immunity plays diverse roles in the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 infection such as clearing HIV-1 and promoting productive HIV-1 replication. In the development of HIV-1 associated neurological disorders (HAND), there may be an imbalance between complement activation and regulation, which may contribute to the neuronal damage as a consequence of HIV-1 infection. It is well recognized that opiate abuse exacerbates HIV-1 neuropathology, however, little is known about the role of complement proteins in opiate induced neuromodulation, specifically in the presence of co-morbidity such as HIV-1 infection. Complement levels are significantly increased in the HIV-1-infected brain, thus HIV-induced complement synthesis may represent an important mechanism for the pathogenesis of AIDS in the brain, but remains underexplored. Anti-HIV-1 antibodies are able to initiate complement activation in HIV-1 infected CNS cells such as microglia and astrocytes during the course of disease progression; however, this complement activation fails to clear and eradicate HIV-1 from infected cells. In addition, the antiretroviral agents used for HIV therapy cause dysregulation of lipid metabolism, endothelial, and adipocyte cell function, and activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We speculate that both HIV-1 and opiates trigger a cytokine-mediated pro-inflammatory stimulus that modulates the complement cascade to exacerbate the virus-induced neurological damage. We examined the expression levels of C1q, SC5b-9, C5L2, C5aR, C3aR, and C9 key members of the complement cascade both in vivo in post mortem brain frontal cortex tissue from patients with HAND who used/did not use heroin, and in vitro using human microglial cultures treated with HIV tat and/or heroin. We observed significant expression of C1q and SC5b-9 by immunofluorescence staining in both the brain cortical and hippocampal region in HAND patients who abused heroin. Additionally, we observed increased gene expression of C5aR, C3aR, and C9 in the brain tissue of both HIV-1 infected patients with HAND who abused and did not abuse heroin, as compared to HIV negative controls. Our results show a significant increase in the expression of complement proteins C9, C5L2, C5aR, and C3aR in HIV transfected microglia and an additional increase in the levels of these complement proteins in heroin-treated HIV transfected microglia. This study highlights the a) potential roles of complement proteins in the pathogenesis of HIV-1-related neurodegenerative disorders; b) the combined effect of an opiate, like heroin, and HIV viral protein like HIV tat on complement proteins in normal human microglial cells and HIV transfected microglial cells. In the context of HAND, targeting selective steps in the complement cascade could help ameliorating the HIV burden in the CNS, thus investigations of complement-related therapeutic approaches for the treatment of HAND are warranted."
3456,0.01,2.0000,"Disease progression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with immune activation. Activation indices are higher during coinfection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV. The effect of immune activation on interferon α (IFN-α) therapy response is unknown. We evaluated soluble CD14 (sCD14) and natural killer (NK)-cell subsets at baseline, and during pegIFN-α2a/ribavirin therapy in HCV-HIV coinfection. The sCD14 level increased during therapy. Baseline sCD14 positively correlated with baseline HCV level and CD16(+)56(-) NK-cell frequency, and both sCD14 and CD16(+)56(-) NK cells correlated negatively with magnitude of HCV decline. IL28B genotype was associated with therapy response but not sCD14 or CD16(+)56(-) NK frequency. Markers of innate immune activation predict poor host response to IFN-α-based HCV therapy during HCV-HIV coinfection."

Data were collected in each LTF over five consecutive days, using a questionnaire that was partly completed by an interviewer and partly self administered. The questionnaire was structured around three topics: socio-demographic characteristics, drug consumption, health and risk/preventive behaviour. Analysis was restricted to attenders who had injected drugs during their lifetime (IDUs). Between 1993 and 2006, the median age of IDUs rose by 10 years. IDUs are severely marginalised and their social situation has improved little. The borrowing of used injection equipment (syringe or needle already used by other person) in the last six months decreased (16.5% in 1993, 8.9% in 2006) but stayed stable at around 10% over the past three surveys. Other risk behaviour, such as sharing spoons, cotton or water, was reported more frequently, although also showed a decreasing trend. The reported prevalence of HIV remained fairly stable at around 10% between 1993 and 2006; reported levels of hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence were high (56.4% in 2006). In conclusion, the overall decrease in the practice of injection has reduced the potential for transmission of infections. However as HCV prevalence is high this is of particular concern, as the current behaviour of IDUs indicates a potential for further spreading of the infection. Another noteworthy trend is the significant decrease in condom use in the case of paid sex."
1626,0.01,2.0000,"No studies to our knowledge have examined the Lepore Social Constraint Scale or Fife Constructed Meaning Scale in recently diagnosed HIV-infected persons. Twenty-four participants in a prospective observational cohort completed the social-constraint measure, and 47 completed the constructed-meaning scale at either 3 or 9 months after diagnosis. Participants completed a 4-week visual analogue scale to assess adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and validated depression and self-efficacy scales. Spearman correlation coefficients compared measures. In cross-sectional analyses, participants with higher social-constraint scores had lower constructed meaning and adherence. Higher social constraint correlated negatively with self-efficacy and positively with depression. Higher constructed-meaning scores did not correlate with adherence but correlated positively with self-efficacy and negatively with depression. The quality of HIV-infected individuals' discussions of HIV with their partners and positive constructed meaning were associated with better mental health and could be targets for improving medication adherence."
12804,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is highly prevalent among chronic dialysis patients (10% to 40%) and is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. However, there are no studies estimating the risk for death among dialysis patients infected with HCV compared with those not infected. We conducted a prospective cohort study to estimate the risk for death among chronic dialysis patients infected with HCV compared with those not infected. In 1992, 200 patients (91%) who had been undergoing dialysis therapy for at least 6 months consented to be screened for HCV infection by enzyme immunoblot assay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Information about potential confounders and potential risk factors for death and HCV infection was obtained from the dialysis center database. Patient outcomes collected included death, transplantation, and loss to follow-up. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the odds of death among dialysis patients who were positive for the HCV antibody and HCV RNA compared with negative patients. Forty-four patients (22%) were HCV antibody positive. Thirty-four patients (17%) were HCV RNA positive. Patients in the HCV RNA-positive group were more likely to be younger (51.8+/-12.6 v 57.2+/-17.3 years of age), men (77% v 54%), and black (65% v 37%). None of the home hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis patients were HCV RNA positive, whereas one of the home hemodialysis and one of the peritoneal dialysis patients were HCV antibody positive. Two patients became infected with HCV during the follow-up period. Patients who were HCV RNA positive and those who were HCV antibody positive were at increased risk for death compared with patients who were negative (adjusted relative risk [aRR]=1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 3.14; P=0.045; and aRR=1.97; 95% CI, 1.16 to 3.33; P=0.012, respectively), after adjusting for time on dialysis, race, transplantation, and age. We conclude that HCV infection increased the risk for death during the study period compared with those not infected. Further studies should assess the measures used to prevent and treat HCV infection."
5155,0.01,2.0000,"Infections by hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus are still common among patients on maintenance dialysis in Western countries. The natural history of HBV and HCV in the dialysis population remains unclear; however, there is good evidence showing an adverse impact of an anti-HCV seropositive status on survival in dialysis patients. A recent meta-analysis of observational studies (n=7, 11,589 unique patients) reported that anti-HCV-positive patients on dialysis had a higher mortality rate than those who were anti-HCV negative (adjusted hazard ratio=1.35, 95% confidence interval, 1.13; 1.59, p<0.001). This was in part attributed to a higher frequency of chronic hepatitis C and its attending complications (cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). In addition, HCV appeared to have a negative influence on quality of life. Recent clinical guidelines by the KDIGO Study Group have not suggested the isolation of anti-HCV-positive patients on maintenance dialysis. Standard precautions and specific procedures against the transmission of blood-borne agents have been recommended to control HCV infection within dialysis units. Isolation by dialysis machines, staff and rooms has been strongly recommended to control HBV. Vaccination is an important tool against transmission of HBV infection among patients on maintenance dialysis; however, the immune response towards the hepatitis B vaccine in uremic patients remains unsatisfactory. Monotherapy with lamivudine is currently used for dialysis patients with hepatitis B whereas combination antiviral therapy (pegylated interferon plus ribavirin) is the standard of care for hepatitis C in the dialysis population, even if various side effects have been observed."
15358,0.01,2.0000,"In order to evaluate hepatitis C virus-RNA (HCV-RNA), immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HCV and risk factors in haemodialysis patients, 180 subjects (45 HCV negative and 135 HCV positive) were studied. Sex, age, duration of dialysis, number of transfusions and ALT were also considered. HCV-RNA was determined by the Amplicor HCV test, and IgM anti-HCV by the Abbott HCV IgM EIA. These markers were present in 40% and 30.4% of anti-HCV positive subjects. The agreement between the two tests employed was 77%. The results showed a close association between HCV-RNA and IgM anti-HCV with abnormal ALT levels and between HCV-RNA and the number of transfusions. Both of these markers were different when correlated with age and time on dialysis, respectively. Therefore, IgM anti-HCV may also serve as a serological marker of HCV infection and a complementary marker of virus replication."
19017,0.01,2.0000,"Hemodialysis in known patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been a subject of controversy. During a 60 month period, 28 hemodialysis access operations were performed upon 22 HIV infected patients. The indication for all procedures was need of dialysis access secondary to end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Operations included 24 arteriovenous dialysis grafts and four Cimino arteriovenous fistulas. All patients had a diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (five), AIDS related complex (six) or were HIV-positive (11) at the time of the operations. All of these patients were intravenous drug abusers. Follow-up study ranged from nine days to 13 months. During the course of this study, two patients died of the progression of AIDS for a mortality rate of 9 per cent. There were nine perioperative complications for a rate of 32 per cent. These results led us to conclude that hemodialysis access operations have application in HIV infected patients with ESRF, and hemodialysis should be considered an appropriate modality in those patients requiring long term dialysis."

Among 189 registered HCWs, 66 (34.9%) performed invasive procedures without any personal protective equipment. Prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs was necessary in 43 (22.8%) cases.

75,0.01,2.0000,"Thalidomide is increasingly being used as adjuvant therapy for patients with mycobacterial and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The T-helper (Th)1 cytokine-Th2 cytokine balance critically determines the outcomes of these diseases. To obtain insight into the effect of thalidomide on the capacity of lymphocytes to produce Th1 and Th2 cytokines, six healthy volunteers received an oral dose (400 mg) of thalidomide. Before and at 3, 6, and 24 h after ingestion of thalidomide, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and stimulated for 24 h with the T-cell stimulant staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) or anti-CD3/CD28. In all six volunteers ingestion of thalidomide was associated with enhanced SEB- and anti-CD3/CD28-induced production of the Th1 cytokine gamma interferon (P < 0.05) and a decrease in the level of anti-CD3/CD28-induced interleukin-5 (IL-5) production (P < 0.05). The levels of IL-2 (Th1) and IL-4 (Th2) released remained unchanged. These changes were accompanied by an increase in the amount of IL-12p40 released by the PBMCs 6 h after ingestion of thalidomide (P < 0.05). Thus, a single oral dose of thalidomide causes a Th1-type response in healthy humans. This finding offers a potential explanation for the positive effect of thalidomide in patients with mycobacterial and HIV infections."
2001,0.01,2.0000,"The purpose of this study was to elicit patient feedback regarding the perceived clarity and level of difficulty associated with self-report human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medication adherence measurement tools. HIV-infected patients from clinics in Shreveport, Louisiana, and Chicago, Illinois, were recruited to participate in four focus group discussions. Three groups consisted of patients with limited literacy skills (< ninth-grade reading ability), and one group contained patients with adequate literacy skills (> or = ninth-grade reading ability). Five themes emerged: (1) respondent understanding of the term ""adherence,"" (2) recall, (3) question format, (4) visual aids, and (5) instrument administration. Participants struggled to define adherence, relied on visual cues to identify medications, and had a short recall time frame for missed doses (< or =3 days). Most preferred simple question formats and for their physician to assess adherence orally. Patients receiving treatment for HIV infection, especially those with limited literacy skills, may find it difficult to respond to existing HIV medication adherence questionnaires."
17865,0.01,2.0000,"During the last quarter of 1992, 984 patients from 13 dialysis centers in the Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur region in France participated in a multicenter cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence, the risk factors, and the clinical consequences of infection by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Serum samples were tested for anti-HCV antibodies using second-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the case of a positive result, a combination test was performed using second-generation recombinant immunoblot (RIBA) or direct detection of HCV-RNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Collected data included the patient's age, gender, cause of the kidney disease, type of dialysis treatment, number of years on dialysis, weekly dialysis time, drug addiction, co-infection with hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), number of kidney transplants, number of blood transfusions, and history of acute or chronic hepatitis. Chronic HCV infection was detected in 232 (23.6%) patients, whereas only 71 (7.2%) were infected by HBV. Logistic-regression analysis showed that HCV infection was associated with dialysis over a long period, numerous blood transfusions, female gender, kidney grafts, HBV infection, hemodialysis, and acute as well as chronic hepatitis. Multiple-correspondence analysis confirmed that the contamination was both transfusional and nosocomial. These results underscore the need for a strict compliance with ""universal precautions"" (Centers for Disease Control [CDC], Atlanta) in dialysis units and raise the question as to whether anti-HCV-positive patients should be isolated."
18230,0.01,2.0000,"Health-related stigma is a cause of stress, alienation and discrimination that can serve as a barrier to prevention and care for infectious diseases such as HIV. Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related stigma is common in Asian immigrants, but has not been formally evaluated. The aim of this study was to develop and validate the first HBV stigma instrument and to begin to evaluate HBV stigma in Chinese immigrants. The HBV stigma instrument was developed based on constructs from validated HIV stigma scales and organized into five domains. A written survey was compiled to include demographic data, HBV knowledge questions and stigma items. The survey was pilot tested in English and Chinese and then finalized. Data were obtained from 201 patients seen in an urban Chinatown Internal Medicine practice. The stigma items showed a high degree of reliability when assessed in aggregate (α = 0.85) as well as within individual domains. Stigma was greatest in the Fear of Contagion domain. Knowledge questions showed a corresponding deficit in understanding of modes of HBV transmission. An inverse relationship between stigma scores and familiarity with HBV provided evidence of construct validity. In multivariable analysis, having a family member with HBV and higher HBV knowledge subset scores were associated with lower degrees of stigma. In conclusion, the hepatitis B stigma instrument showed reliability and construct validity. The relationship identified between familiarity and knowledge regarding HBV with lower stigma scores provides the basis for the development of interventions to reduce HBV stigma."
1049,0.01,2.0000,"Drug-naive patients infected with drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) who initiate antiretroviral therapy show a shorter time to virologic failure than patients infected with wild-type (WT) viruses. Resistance-related HIV genotypes not commonly seen in treated patients, which likely result from reversion or loss of primary resistance mutations, have also been recognized in drug-naive persons. Little work has been done to characterize the patterns of mutations in these viruses and the frequency of occurrence, their association with phenotypic resistance, and their effect on fitness and evolution of resistance. Through the analysis of resistance mutations in 1082 newly diagnosed antiretroviral-naive persons from the United States, we found that 35 of 48 (72.9%) persons infected with HIV-1 containing thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) had viruses that lacked a primary mutation (T215Y/F, K70R, or Q151M). Of these viruses, 9 (25.7%) had only secondary TAMs (D67N, K219Q, M41L, or F77L), and all were found to be sensitive to zidovudine (AZT) and other drugs. To assess the impact of secondary TAMs on the evolution of AZT resistance, we generated recombinant viruses from cloned plasma-derived reverse transcriptase sequences. Two viruses had D67N, three had D67N and K219Q/E, and three were WT. Four site-directed mutants with D67N, K219Q, K219E, and D67N/K219Q were also made in HIV-1(HXB2). In vitro selection of AZT resistance showed that viruses with D67N and/or K219Q/E acquired AZT resistance mutations more rapidly than WT viruses (36 days compared to 54 days; P = 0.003). To investigate the factors associated with the rapid selection of AZT mutations in these viruses, we evaluated fitness differences among HXB2(WT) and HXB2(D67N) or HXB2(D67N/K219Q) in the presence of AZT. Both HXB2(D67N/K219Q) and HXB2(D67N) were more fit than HXB2(WT) in the presence of either low or high AZT concentrations, likely reflecting low-level resistance to AZT that is not detectable by phenotypic testing. In the absence of AZT, the fitness cost conferred by D67N or K219Q was modest. Our results demonstrate that viruses with unique patterns of TAMs, including D67N and/or K219Q/E, are commonly found among newly diagnosed persons and illustrate the expanding diversity of revertant viruses in this population. The modest fitness cost conferred by D67N and K219Q supports persistence of these mutants in the untreated population and highlights the potential for secondary transmission. The faster evolution of these mutants toward AZT resistance is consistent with the higher viral fitness in the presence of AZT and shows that these viruses are phenotypically different from WT HIV-1. Our study emphasizes the need for clinical studies to better define the impact of these mutants on treatment responses and evolution of resistance."
5667,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) contains four structural motifs (A, B, C, and D) that are conserved in polymerases from diverse organisms. Motif B interacts with the incoming nucleotide, the template strand, and key active-site residues from other motifs, suggesting that motif B is an important determinant of substrate specificity. To examine the functional role of this region, we performed ""random scanning mutagenesis"" of 11 motif B residues and screened replication-competent mutants for altered substrate analog sensitivity in culture. Single amino acid replacements throughout the targeted region conferred resistance to lamivudine and/or hypersusceptibility to zidovudine (AZT). Substitutions at residue Q151 increased the sensitivity of HIV-1 to multiple nucleoside analogs, and a subset of these Q151 variants was also hypersusceptible to the pyrophosphate analog phosphonoformic acid (PFA). Other AZT-hypersusceptible mutants were resistant to PFA and are therefore phenotypically similar to PFA-resistant variants selected in vitro and in infected patients. Collectively, these data show that specific amino acid replacements in motif B confer broad-spectrum hypersusceptibility to substrate analog inhibitors. Our results suggest that motif B influences RT-deoxynucleoside triphosphate interactions at multiple steps in the catalytic cycle of polymerization."
10012,0.01,2.0000,"Spontaneous loss of HBsAg is infrequent in adult HBV carriers. Little is known about this serological change in children. In a prospective study of 420 hepatitis B virus-carrier children who were observed for 1 to 12 yr (mean = 4.3 yr), spontaneous loss of HBsAg occurred in 10 patients, with an average incidence of 0.6%/yr. The HBsAg clearance rate was significantly higher in children who had anti-HBe; children who were at an older age on entry; children whose mothers were HBsAg-; or children with severe liver histological changes detected while they were HBeAg+. Children who seroconverted from HBeAg to anti-HBe before the age of 6 or who had a peak serum ALT level above 100 IU/L were more likely to clear HBsAg. In all 10 patients who became HBsAg-, serum hepatitis B virus DNA became undetectable by both spot hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction, suggesting a complete clearance of the virus from serum. After the loss of HBsAg, the anti-HBs levels were higher in the children born to carrier mothers than in those born to noncarrier mothers. These findings suggest that chronic hepatitis B virus-carrier children rarely lose HBsAg, especially if they have been infected during the perinatal period and have mild histological changes. The poor humoral immune response to HBsAg may be a contributing factor in the establishment of carrier status during horizontal infection but may not be primarily involved in the establishment of carrier status during perinatal infection."

All 582 survivors were invited for reevaluation, and 385 patients, of whom 82 (21.3%) were HIV seropositive, were evaluated. Of those, 325 consenting patients, of whom 67 (20.6%) were HIV seropositive, were followed for 12 months. One year after TB had been diagnosed 47 (31.3%) of the 150 HIV seropositive and 22 (4.4%) of the 501 HIV seronegative patients traced had died (p = 10(-6]. During the subsequent year the mortality of 67 HIV seropositive patients (26.3/100 patient-years) was higher than that of the 303 HIV seronegative patients (2.2/100 patients-years, p = 10(-6]. HIV seropositive patients had a higher overall TB therapy failure rate 24 months after the diagnosis of TB than did HIV seronegative patients (21.1/100 patient-years versus 8.1/100 patient-years, p = 0.002), mainly because their relapse rate of pulmonary TB (18.1/100 patient-years) was higher than that of HIV seronegative patients (6.0/100 patient-years, p = 0.03). Given their higher relapse rate after 1 yr of ""standard"" chemotherapy, the public health impact of routine maintenance therapy in HIV seropositive patients with pulmonary TB who complete such therapy should be assessed in comparison to the introduction of rifampicin-based short-course antituberculosis chemotherapy in developing countries."
959,0.01,2.0000,"Despite recent clinical guidelines recommending early initiation and widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), many HIV-infected individuals are not receiving ART-in particular low-income, minority substance users. Few studies have examined psychological, as opposed to structural, factors related to not receiving ART in this population. Perceived capacity to tolerate physical and psychological distress, known as distress tolerance (DT), may be a particularly relevant yet understudied factor. The current study tested the relationship between self-reported physical and psychological DT and ART receipt among predominantly low-income, minority HIV-infected substance users (n=77). Psychiatric disorders, biological indicators of health status, ART use, structural barriers to health care, and self-reported physical and psychological DT were assessed. 61% of participants were receiving ART. The only factors that distinguished individuals not on ART were greater avoidance of physical discomfort, higher psychological DT, and higher CD4 count. Both DT measures remained associated with ART use after controlling for CD4 count and were associated with almost a two-fold decrease in likelihood of ART receipt. Current findings suggest higher perceived capacity to tolerate psychological distress and greater avoidance of physical discomfort are important factors associated with lower ART use among substance users and may be important intervention targets."
1866,0.01,2.0000,"Noncirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH) represents a relatively infrequent group of conditions that causes portal hypertension in the absence of cirrhosis. An association between NCPH and patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been reported. Six consecutive patients with HIV infection and NCPH were the subject of this series. Case histories, including medication lists, liver biopsy and laboratory data were reviewed. Age at diagnosis was 43 +/- 3 years (range, 37-47). Liver disease was diagnosed 12 +/- 4 years (range, 8-18) after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). All patients developed esophageal varices, 5 patients presented at least one bleeding episode and 2 required TIPS. Serum liver tests showed a mean total bilirubin of 1.4 +/- .7 mg/dL (range, .5-2.5) and INR was 1.2 +/- .14 (range, 1.0-1.4). CD4 count was 326 +/- 124 cells/mL (range, 198-467) and all patients presented HIV viral load < 75 copes/mL. Didanosine (ddl) was the most common ART drug being used by 4 patients. Portal vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 2 patients. Hepatic portal sclerosis (HPS) alone was observed in 1 patient, nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) alone in 2 patients and combined HPS/NRH in 3 patients. In conclusion, NCPH should be included in the differential diagnosis of HIV-individuals presenting with clinical manifestations of portal hypertension and well preserved liver synthetic function. Prolonged exposure to ART, specially ddl, can play a pathogenic role. Rarely, liver synthetic function is sufficiently severe to warrant liver transplantation."
2098,0.01,2.0000,"Determination of the infectious virus burden at the organ level is critical for understanding the pathophysiology of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. To evaluate the burden of HIV-1 in the lung, quantitative cultures were performed on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from 11 HIV-1 seropositive subjects without respiratory infections and compared with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from the same subjects. Fifty percent (50%) of subjects had positive BAL cell cultures while 82% had positive PBMC cultures. There was much less virus cultured from BAL cells than from PBMCs, whether using phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) targets (p < 0.05) or adherent monocyte targets (p < 0.02). There was no significant difference between the HIV-1 titers obtained for BAL cells whether using PHA-stimulated PBL or adherent monocyte targets (p = 0.13). These studies demonstrate that BAL cell cultures for HIV-1 in subjects without respiratory infections are less frequently positive than PBMC cultures, that less virus can be recovered from BAL cells than from PBMC, and that HIV-1 isolates from BAL cells replicate in both PHA-stimulated PBL targets and adherent monocyte targets. Quantitative assessment of virus burden in the lung is important for future studies of HIV-1 pathogenesis and for evaluating potential antiretroviral therapies aimed at altering the natural history of organ dysfunction associated with retroviral replication."

Lung segments involved with pulmonary tuberculosis had significantly elevated HIV-1 branched DNA (bDNA) levels and p24 in BAL compared with lung segments uninvolved with tuberculosis or with BAL from patients with no lung disease. The BAL viral burden was higher than plasma HIV-1 in tuberculosis patients, indicating local production of virus. BAL HIV-1 bDNA declined over the course of treatment for tuberculosis in three patients who underwent serial bronchoscopies. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and HIV-1 bDNA particles were strongly correlated (r2 = 0.9, p < 0.01) in lung segments involved with tuberculosis. The deduced amino acid sequence of HIV-1 gp120 V3 region from involved segments of three patients with pulmonary tuberculosis showed basic substitutions associated with altered viral phenotype. Phylogenetic analysis of V3 sequences demonstrated that BAL HIV-1 RNA had diverged from plasma. These data support the conclusion that pulmonary tuberculosis enhances local HIV-1 replication in vivo."

Seven days post-infection of D0 cells Bal DNA was present in CD14bright and CD14- fractions, suggesting D0 infection of diverse progenitor types. HXB2 DNA was detected in CD14bright cells alone indicating D0 infection of monocyte progenitors only.

This will translate into higher incidence rates of CVD in HIV infected participants, when compared to HIV negative participants, after adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors. When characterized further using cardiovascular imaging, biomarkers, immunological and genetic profiles, CVD associated with HIV will show different characteristics compared to CVD in HIV-negative individuals."

Adherence was defined as a self-report of 100% adherence in the past four weeks. Odds ratios were calculated to determine the relation of reported barriers to adherence for race and gender groups, and for the sample overall. For every ten-point increase in barrier score, there was an 86% increased risk of being non-adherent (OR=1.86; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.91). Adherence was not different between racial and gender groups, nor was total barrier score. However, individual barriers were differentially endorsed across groups. Rather than relying on demographic predictors, which may be only an indirect marker of adherence, evaluations of adherence should examine the psychological and social barriers to positive adherence outcomes in individual patients. Our findings support the use of theory-based behavioural interventions that address perceived barriers to adherence and other health promotion activities."
207,0.01,2.0000,"The impact of hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) on patient survival after kidney transplantation is controversial. The aims of this study were (1) to assess the independent prognostic values of HBsAg and anti-HCV in a large renal transplant population, (2) to compare infected patients with noninfected patients matched for factors possibly associated with graft and patient survival, and (3) to assess the prognostic value of biopsy-proven cirrhosis. Eight hundred thirty-four transplanted patients were included: 128 with positive HBsAg (group I), 216 with positive anti-HCV (group II), and 490 without serological markers of HBV and HCV (group III). Fifteen percent and 29% of patients were HBsAg-positive and anti-HCV-positive, respectively. Ten-year survivals of group I (55 +/- 6%) and group II (65 +/- 5%) were significantly lower than survival of group III (80 +/- 3%, P <.001). At 10 years, among overall patients with HCV screening (n = 834), four variables had independent prognostic values in patient survival: age at transplantation (P <.0001), year of transplantation (P =.02), biopsy-proven cirrhosis (P =.03), and presence of HCV antibodies (P =.02). In the case control study, comparison of infected patients with their matched control patients showed that age at transplantation (P <.05), HBsAg (P =.005), and anti-HCV (P =.005) were independent prognostic factors. HCV, biopsy-proven cirrhosis, and age are independent prognostic factors of 10-year survival in patients with kidney grafts. The case-control study showed that anti-HCV and HBsAg were independently associated with patient and graft survivals. In infected patients, a routine liver histological analysis would improve selection of patients for renal transplantation."
11141,0.01,2.0000,"Although growth failure is common during pediatric infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and associated with increased mortality, the relation of specific nutrition factors with growth and mortality has not been well characterized. A longitudinal study was conducted with 194 HIV-infected infants in Kampala, Uganda. Plasma vitamin A, carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein/zeaxanthin), and vitamin E were measured at age 14 wk, and weight and height were followed up to age 12 mo. Vitamin A and low plasma carotenoid concentrations were predictive of decreased weight and height velocity. Between ages 14 wk and 12 mo, 32% of infants died. Underweight, stunting, and low concentrations of plasma carotenoids were associated with increased risk of death in univariate analyses. Plasma vitamin A concentrations were not associated with risk of death. In a final multivariate model adjusting for weight-for-age, plasma beta-carotene was significantly associated with increased mortality (odds ratio: 3.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.38 to 7.21, P < 0.006). These data suggest that low concentrations of plasma carotenoids are associated with increased risk of death during HIV infection among infants in Uganda."
3869,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related stigma among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) has been associated with adverse health outcomes, including poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy and care, and increased participation in behaviors linked to higher rates of HIV transmission. In China, the incidence of HIV is growing more rapidly among MSM than among other subgroups. This study characterizes and quantifies HIV stigma among HIV-infected MSM in Beijing, China, which arguably may be driving this epidemic. A cross-sectional survey study was performed among 266 HIV-positive MSM in Beijing, China, in 2014. The Berger HIV Stigma Scale was used to measure levels of HIV-related stigma. Participants additionally answered questions regarding socio-demographic characteristics and HIV-associated risk factors; previously validated Mandarin-language scales assessed depression, coping style, and social support networks. Multivariable linear regression models were used to identify variables significantly associated with HIV stigma. The mean overall HIV stigma score among the study population was 112.78 ± 18.11 (score range: 40-160). Higher HIV stigma scores were positively associated with depression (β = 7.99, 95% CI:3.69, 12.29, p < .001) and negative coping skills (β = 0.64, 95% CI:0.21,1.08, p < .01), and was negatively associated with disclosed HIV status (β = -6.45, 95%CI:-11.80, -1.11, p < .05), and availability of social support networks (β = -0.12, 95%CI:-0.22, -0.02, p < .05). Other variables such as poor self-rated health status and presence of opportunistic infections were positively associated with individual dimensions of HIV-related stigma. The results of this study can inform the development of culturally sensitive interventions to reduce HIV-related stigma among MSM with HIV in China, with the overarching goal of reducing HIV transmission in this vulnerable population."
9952,0.01,2.0000,"Even when antiretroviral therapy (ART) is started early after infection, HIV DNA might persist in the central nervous system (CNS), possibly contributing to inflammation, brain damage and neurocognitive impairment. Paired blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were collected from 16 HIV-infected individuals on suppressive ART: 9 participants started ART <4 months of the estimated date of infection (EDI) (""early ART""), and 7 participants started ART >14 months after EDI (""late ART""). For each participant, neurocognitive functioning was measured by Global Deficit Score (GDS). HIV DNA levels were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and CSF cell pellets by droplet digital (dd)PCR. Soluble markers of inflammation (sCD163, IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-α) and neuronal damage (neurofilament light [NFL]) were measured in blood and CSF supernatant by immunoassays. HIV-1 partial C2V3 env deep sequencing data (Roche 454) were obtained for 8 paired PBMC and CSF specimens and used for phylogenetic and compartmentalization analysis. Median exposure to ART at the time of sampling was 2.6 years (IQR: 2.2-3.7) and did not differ between groups. We observed that early ART was significantly associated with lower molecular diversity of HIV DNA in CSF (p<0.05), and lower IL-6 levels in CSF (p = 0.02), but no difference for GDS, NFL, or HIV DNA detectability compared to late ART. Compartmentalization of HIV DNA populations between CSF and blood was detected in 6 out of 8 participants with available paired HIV DNA sequences (2 from early and 4 from late ART group). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of monophyletic HIV DNA populations within the CSF in 7 participants, and the same population was repeatedly sampled over a 5 months period in one participant with longitudinal sampling. Such compartmentalized provirus in the CNS needs to be considered for the design of future eradication strategies and might contribute to the neuropathogenesis of HIV."
8622,0.01,2.0000,"Potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically improved the prognosis of HIV-1-infected individuals. However, 10% to 30% of patients in Western countries still present late for care, when CD4 T cells are below 200 cells/mm(3) and symptomatic HIV disease has occurred. Clinical considerations for advanced HIV disease are paramount as morbidity and mortality are directly correlated with a low initial CD4 T cell count, which is commonly associated with the simultaneous occurrence of co-morbidities, particularly opportunistic infections. Upon start of ART, the clinical entity of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome may occur and, in this context, raise the question of early versus delayed ART in patients treated for opportunistic infections. Recent data clearly indicate that an earlier start of ART is warranted in this latter situation. Guidelines for specific antiretroviral treatment for late-presenting patients are lacking. Knowledge about drug-drug interactions and co-morbidities should guide treatment choices and influence the clinical management and monitoring of drug-related side effects and interactions. Importantly, the outlook of patients who present late is very much dependent upon the initial response to ART. Nevertheless, even if optimal response to treatment has been achieved, long-term prognosis may be impaired in patients who initially presented with advanced HIV disease. We encourage physicians to perform HIV testing more frequently in order to detect HIV-infected individuals in time."
14151,0.01,2.0000,"The aim of this study was to evaluate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient's body composition changes by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and to analyze factors associated with lipodystrophy (LD). Total-body composition was measured by DXA in HIV-infected men and healthy men. HIV-infected men were divided into LD patients and non-LD patients according to whether they were complicated with LD. Healthy men were selected as controls. Fat mass (FM) of HIV-infected patients correlated negatively with the duration of HIV infection and with the duration of highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen (r(s)=-0.448 and -0.563; p=0.032 and 0.000, respectively). Multiple linear regression results showed that FM had positive correlation with weight and bone mineral content (BMC) and had negative correlation with lean mass (LM). Total body and regional FMs were found to be significantly different among LD patients, non-LD patients, and controls-the lowest in LD patients and the highest in controls (p<0.05). Total body, trunk, and leg BMCs of LD patients were lower than those of controls (p<0.05). Lumbar bone mineral density of LD patients was lower than that of non-LD patients and controls (p=0.04 and 0.007). LM of LD patients was higher than that of non-LD patients, and trunk LM had statistical difference between the 2 groups (p=0.003). Applying DXA to assess HIV-infected patient's body composition changes could provide objective information for physicians to prevent LD and osteoporosis."
11097,0.01,2.0000,"The advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 1996 resulted in fewer patients experiencing clinical events, so that some prognostic analyses of individual cohort studies of human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals had low statistical power. Because of this, the Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration (ART-CC) of HIV cohort studies in Europe and North America was established in 2000, with the aim of studying the prognosis for clinical events in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the mortality of adult patients treated for HIV-1 infection. In 2002, the ART-CC collected data on more than 12,000 patients in 13 cohorts who had begun combination ART between 1995 and 2001. Subsequent updates took place in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010. The ART-CC data base now includes data on more than 70,000 patients participating in 19 cohorts who began treatment before the end of 2009. Data are collected on patient demographics (e.g. sex, age, assumed transmission group, race/ethnicity, geographical origin), HIV biomarkers (e.g. CD4 cell count, plasma viral load of HIV-1), ART regimen, dates and types of AIDS events, and dates and causes of death. In recent years, additional data on co-infections such as hepatitis C; risk factors such as smoking, alcohol and drug use; non-HIV biomarkers such as haemoglobin and liver enzymes; and adherence to ART have been collected whenever available. The data remain the property of the contributing cohorts, whose representatives manage the ART-CC via the steering committee of the Collaboration. External collaboration is welcomed. Details of contacts are given on the ART-CC website (www.art-cohort-collaboration.org)."
14572,0.01,2.0000,"Unsafe injection practices significantly increase the risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among injection drug users (IDUs). We examined individual and socio-environmental factors associated with unsafe injection practices in young adult IDUs in San Diego, California. Of 494 IDUs, 46.9 % reported receptive syringe sharing and 68.8 % sharing drug preparation paraphernalia in the last 3 months. Unsafe injection practices were associated with increased odds of having friends who injected drugs with used syringes, injecting with friends or sexual partners, and injecting heroin. Perceived high susceptibility to HIV and perceived barriers to obtaining sterile syringes were associated with increased odds of receptive syringe sharing, but not with sharing injection paraphernalia. Over half the IDUs reported unsafe injection practices. Our results suggest that personal relationships might influence IDUs' perceptions that dictate behavior. Integrated interventions addressing individual and socio-environmental factors are needed to promote safe injection practices in this population."
4617,0.01,2.0000,"The influence of human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type II (HTLV-II) in individuals also infected with HIV-1 is poorly understood. To evaluate the reciprocal influence of HTLV-II and HIV-1 infection, primary peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from coinfected individuals were established in the presence of interleukin 2 (IL-2). In these cultures, the kinetics of HTLV-II replication always preceded those of HIV-1. Noteworthy, the kinetics of HIV-1 production were inversely correlated to the HTLV-II proviral load in vivo and its replication ex vivo. These observations suggested a potential interaction between the 2 retroviruses. In this regard, the levels of IL-2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured in the same coinfected PBMC cultures. Endogenous IL-2 was not produced, whereas IL-6 and TNF-alpha were secreted at levels compatible with their known ability to up-regulate HIV-1 expression. The HIV-suppressive CC-chemokines RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), and MIP-1beta were also determined in IL-2-stimulated PBMC cultures. Of interest, their kinetics and concentrations were inversely related to those of HIV-1 replication. Experiments were performed in which CD8(+) T cells or PBMCs from HTLV-II monoinfected individuals were cocultivated with CD4(+) T cells from HIV-1 monoinfected individuals separated by a semipermeable membrane in the presence or absence of antichemokine neutralizing antibodies. The results indicate that HTLV-II can interfere with the replicative potential of HIV-1 by up-regulating viral suppressive CC-chemokines and, in particular, MIP-1alpha. This study is the first report indicating that HTLV-II can influence HIV replication, at least in vitro, via up-regulation of HIV-suppressive chemokines. (Blood. 2000;95:2760-2769)"
10440,0.01,2.0000,"Women with perinatally acquired HIV (PAH) face unique psychosocial challenges due to the presence of a lifelong chronic illness and often unstable living situations. With advances in HIV treatment, an increasing number of those with PAH are reaching childbearing age and becoming pregnant. Depression may be an important and common factor that complicates both treatment and pregnancy outcomes in this group. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in pregnant patients with PAH to determine if history of depression is associated with nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We reviewed charts of women with PAH receiving prenatal care at a single institution from March 1995 to December 2012. ART nonadherence was measured by patient self-report of any missed doses in the third trimester. Demographic, obstetric, and HIV infection characteristics of patients with a history of depression (dPAH) were compared to patients without a history of depression. Nine pregnancies among 6 dPAH women and 14 pregnancies among 12 PAH women without a history of depression were identified. None of the dPAH women reported 100% adherence to ART in the third trimester while 57% of women without a history of depression reported strict adherence (p = 0.04). The mean HIV RNA level at delivery was higher among dPAH women (17,399 vs. 2966 copies/Ml; p = 0.03) and fewer reached an undetectable HIV RNA level (<400 copies/mL) at delivery (p = 0.03). We concluded that a history of depression may contribute to poor medication adherence and treatment outcomes among pregnant women with PAH. Focused attention on diagnosis and treatment of depression in the preconception period may lead to more optimal medication adherence. "
6634,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B reactivation has been widely reported in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy in oncohaematological and transplant settings, with a high frequency of hepatic failure. This topic has received growing scientific interest and several studies reported the preventive effect of antiviral agents on hepatitis B reactivation during immunosuppression therapy. Routine prophylaxis is therefore recommended and specific recommendations were elaborated by AASLD, EASL and AISF. On the contrary, few data are available on the risk of HBV reactivation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving immunosuppressive therapy, and major questions regarding the optimal management (screening, prophylaxis, therapy, monitoring) of IBD patients with HBV infection remain to be addressed. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic review of the literature to underline the main aspects of HBV infection and reactivation in patients affected by IBD treated with conventional or biological immunosuppressive drugs."
3235,0.01,2.0000,"To evaluate whether uncircumcised status is correlated with acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 502 homosexual men were surveyed; 85% were circumcised. HIV infection was significantly associated with uncircumcised status (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2, 3.8), nonwhite race, intravenous drug use, sexual contact with an intravenous drug user, number of male partners, frequency of unprotected receptive anal intercourse, and with history of genital herpes, anal herpes, or syphilis. Uncircumcised status was significantly associated with older age, nonwhite race, and history of syphilis; it was inversely associated with intravenous drug use. Using logistic regression analysis, the adjusted OR for the association between HIV infection and uncircumcised status was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.0, 4.0). Uncircumcised homosexual men had 2-fold increased risk of HIV infection. The role of circumcision as an intervention strategy to reduce sexual transmission of HIV warrants consideration."
16484,0.01,2.0000,"Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection control, and are regulated by a complex network of activating and inhibitory receptors. However, NK cell activity in HBV patients remains poorly understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the phenotypic and functional characteristics of circulating NK cells in patients during different chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection stages. We investigated NK cell phenotypes, receptor expression and function in 86 CHB patients and 20 healthy controls. NK cells were purified and NK cell subsets were characterized by flow cytometry. Cytotoxic activity (CD107a) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) secretion were examined, and Natural Killer p46 (NKP46) blockade and spontaneous NK cell cytolytic activity against K562, HepG2 and HepG2.215 cell lines was studied. Activating NKp46 receptor expression was higher in inactive HBsAg carriers when compared with other groups (p = 0.008). NKp46 expression negatively correlated with HBV DNA (R = -0.253, p = 0.049) and ALT (R = -0.256, p = 0.045) levels. CD107a was higher in immune-activated groups when compared with immune-tolerant groups (p = 0.039). CD107a expression was related to viral load (p = 0.02) and HBeAg status (p = 0.024). In vitro NKp46 blockade reduced NK cell cytolytic activity against HepG2 and HepG2.215 cell lines (p = 0.02; p = 0.039). Furthermore, NK cells from high viral load CHB patients displayed significantly lower specific cytolytic activity against anti-NKp46-loaded K562 targets (p = 0.0321). No significant differences were observed in IFN-γ secretion (p > 0.05). In conclusion, NKp46 expression regulates NK cell cytolytic function. NKp46 may moderate NK cell activity during HBV replication suppression and HBV-associated liver damage and may be critical for NK cell activity during CHB infection. "

Sera were collected from 1,269 study subjects in the urban area of the capital city, Mogadishu, and in the rural towns of Merka, Qoryoley, and Kismayo. The subjects included 57 prostitutes, 79 sexually transmitted disease (STD) patients, and 1,133 others, including outpatient and hospitalized patients with leprosy, tuberculosis, other infectious diseases, individuals from rehabilitation camps and secondary schools, and Ethiopian immigrants. Results indicated that none of the sera were positive for HIV-1 and HIV-2 by Western blot, but one was positive for HTLV-I. The prostitutes had a significantly higher prevalence of treponemal antibody (50.8%; P less than 0.0001) than either the STD patients (12.6%) or the other subjects (5.2%). Epidemiologic data indicated that 94% of the males and females were circumcised and only 2.6% of the males used condoms. Overall, the results of this study suggested a very low prevalence of HIV-1, HIV-2, and HTLV-I infections, especially among prostitutes and STD patients, who were considered at greatest risk of contracting these retroviral infections."
19153,0.01,2.0000,"An in-depth understanding of the different groups that make up the HIV-infected population should inform prevention and care. Using latent class analysis (LCA) we identified seven groups with similar socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics at enrolment in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study: older gay men, younger gay men, older heterosexual men, injection drug users, single migrants, migrant women in partnerships and heterosexual men and women. Outcomes of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) were analyzed in 1,633 patients starting ART. Compared to older gay men, the probability of a virologic response to ART was reduced in single migrants, in older heterosexual men and in IDUs. Loss to follow-up was higher in single migrants and IDUs, and mortality was increased in older heterosexual men and IDUs. Socio-behavioral groups identified by LCA allow insights above what can be gleaned from traditional transmission groups, and may identify patients who could benefit from targeted interventions."
17753,0.01,2.0000,"Research linking psychological inhibition to physical illness led us to examine whether human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection might progress more rapidly among gay men who conceal their homosexual identity than among those who do not. We also sought to determine whether any accelerated course of HIV infection among ""closeted"" gay men might be attributable to differences in health-relevant behavior (e.g., health practices, sexual behavior) or psychosocial characteristics (e.g., depression, anxiety, social support, repressive coping style). Data came from a longitudinal psychosocial study associated with the Los Angeles site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Eighty gay men, HIV-seropositive but otherwise healthy at study entry (CD4 T lymphocytes = 30-60% of total lymphocytes), were examined at 6-month intervals for 9 years. Indicators of HIV progression included time to a critically low CD4 T lymphocyte level (15% of total peripheral blood lymphocytes), time to AIDS diagnosis, and time to AIDS mortality. On all measures, HIV infection advanced more rapidly in a dose-response relationship to the degree participants concealed their homosexual identity. Sample characteristics and statistical controls ruled out explanations based on demographic characteristics, health practices, sexual behavior, and antiretroviral therapy. Mediational analyses indicated that observed effects were not attributable to differences in depression, anxiety, social support, or repressive coping style. HIV infection appears to progress more rapidly in gay men who conceal their homosexual identity. These results are consistent with hypotheses about the health effects of psychological inhibition, but further research is required to definitively identify the psychosocial, behavioral, and physiological mechanisms underlying these findings."

17671,0.01,2.0000,"This article explores how a group of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients perceived their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in relation to their coping capacity expressed as sense of coherence. The emphasis was on gender differences. The sample consisted of 55 women (29%) and 134 men (71%), receiving outpatient medical care in a hospital. Self-report instruments, the health index, the HIV symptom scale, the well-being scale, the sense of coherence (SOC) scale and the Interview Schedule for Social Interaction were used. Disease status (HIV CDC classification, absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count and HIV/RNA) was also measured, and demographic data were collected. The total sample scored significantly worse self-rated health and weaker SOC than healthy controls. The HIV-infected women were significantly younger than the men (p < 0.0001). The majority of the women (60%) were infected by heterosexual transmission and of the men (58%) by homosexual/bisexual contacts. In the univariate analysis the women scored significantly less positive well-being (p < 0.05), weaker SOC (p < 0.05), and less social support (p < 0.01) than the men despite less advanced disease. Multiple regression analyses revealed that SOC was the strongest predictor of subjective HRQOL in both genders. The results suggest that health professionals who individualize their care of HIV-infected patients should try to be sensitive to the different ways in which men and women express their HRQOL."

DC are potent accessory cells for a number of T cell-mediated immune responses, including autologous and allogeneic mixed leukocyte reactions, and mitogen- and antigen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. In the present study, DC purified from human peripheral blood were inoculated with various strains (IIIB, SF2, WMJ1, SF162, 89.6 and clone HXB2) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) displaying different patterns of cellular tropism. Viral replication was demonstrated by detection of p24 antigen (Ag) intracellularly and in culture supernatants, and by Southern and Northern blot analyses for the presence of HIV DNA and RNA, respectively, within infected cells. Cell-free and cell-associated p24 Ag levels rose substantially when DC were inoculated with strains SF162, 89.6 and clone HXB2. In contrast, p24 Ag levels rose only marginally after inoculation of DC with strains IIIB, SF2 and WMJ1. Purified DC did not express detectable membrane CD4, although CD4 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase PCR. The presence of anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies failed to block infection of DC by any of the HIV strains tested, suggesting the existence of a CD4-independent alternative pathway of viral entry. The possibility that DC serve as a reservoir for HIV-1 must be considered."

In the present study, we aimed to determine whether HIV-1 in the bone marrow of TP patients can infect primary megakaryocytes in vitro, which may contribute to the development of thrombocytopenia. We amplified the V3 loop of HIV-1 envelope from the bone marrow of TP and non-TP patients and constructed recombinant viruses. We demonstrate that the bone marrow of TP and non-TP patients contained R5 strains, whereas X4 strains were present only in the bone marrow of TP patients. Furthermore, HIV-1 from the bone marrow of TP and non-TP patients infected megakaryocytes to similar levels, suggesting that the V3 loop of HIV-1 may not contain the viral determinants of HIV-associated TP. Chemokine receptor analysis determined that CD34+-cell-derived megakaryocytes express CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5 and are productively infected by both X4 and R5 HIV-1 isolates. Finally, we showed that CD34+-cell-derived megakaryocytes express the chemokine receptor CCR3."

At entry into prenatal care, the mean CD4 cell count for this cohort of patients was 406 cells/mm(3) (95% CI: 373-438 cells/mm(3)), while the mean HIV RNA was 24,394 copies/ml (95% CI: 18,275-30,513 copies/ml). Thirty-six women (16%) had detectable antiretroviral-resistant mutations. By 34 weeks gestation, 75% had achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/ml. Our logistic regression model showed the odds of harbouring antiretroviral-resistant virus with a baseline CD4 cell count of <200 cells/mm(3) was eight times that of subjects with CD4 cell counts >500 CD4 cells/mm(3) (95% CI 1.5-42.73). Six infants were HIV infected, four born to mothers with detectable viraemia at 34 weeks and two born to mothers who were lost to follow up. Antiretroviral resistance is common in prenatal care but did not increase vertical transmission if viral load was appropriately suppressed. Genotyping should be considered in Brazil in order to assist initiation of appropriate combination antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy to suppress viral load to avoid vertical transmission. "

Their pathogenesis may differ from primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and is associated with various factors including the virus itself or the antiretroviral therapy. In order to evaluate the differences between HIV-related MDF and MDS, the morphological changes in peripheral blood and bone marrow, cytogenetic analysis and the response to anaemia treatment were studied in 158 HIV+ patients with haemophilia and the results were compared with those of 61 patients with primary MDS (31 with RA, 10 with RARS, 11 with RAEB, three with RAEB-t and six with CMML). The eligibility criteria for patients with MDS were primary MDS, Hb levels < 10 g dL(-1), and no significant organ disease. The peripheral blood and bone marrow examination revealed MDF in 44 HIV-infected haemophilic patients (27.8%). The median time from seroconversion was 12.5 years and the mean time under AZT therapy was 44.1 months. Nineteen of these patients (43.1%) had Hb levels < 10 g dL(-1), while neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 29.5% and 25%, respectively. Every patient of this study with Hb < 10 g dL(-1) received erythropoietin (Epo). There were statistically significant morphological alterations between HIV-related MDF and MDS: hypocellularity, plasmatocytosis and eosinophilia were more pronounced in HIV haemophiliacs with MDF, while dysplasia of erythroblasts, megakaryocytes and granulocytes was more frequent in MDS patients. No HIV haemophilic patient with MDF had more than 5% blasts in the bone marrow nor did any develop RAEB or acute leukaemia during the period of this study. The cytogenetic analysis was normal in HIV-infected patients with haemophilia whereas 42.6% of patients with MDS had an abnormal karyotype. Complete erythroid response was achieved with Epo administration in 84.2% of HIV+ haemophilic patients with anaemia compared to 19.7% of patients with MDS. These data suggest that bone marrow changes in long-term HIV patients have different characteristics from primary MDS and constitute the entity for which the name HIV-myelopathy has been proposed in the literature."
1685,0.005,1.0000,"Bone disorders have been described in patients chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A case of spontaneous supracondylar femoral fracture that occurred in a 58-year-old monk during meditation is reported. His AIDS disease was controlled with combination antiretroviral therapy. Vitamin D and calcium had been added 3yr before since osteoporosis was detected by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). At the time of the fracture, the patient was on treatment with 35mg every week of sodium risedronate, 1000mg of calcium, and 400IU of Vitamin D every day. Clinical use of DXA for HIV patients should be considered as a routine measure to help reducing risk for fractures."
17133,0.005,1.0000,"Identifying the immunologic and virologic consequences of discontinuing antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients is of major importance in developing long-term treatment strategies for patients with HIV-1 infection. We designed a trial to characterize these parameters after interruption of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients who had maintained prolonged viral suppression on antiretroviral drugs. Eighteen patients with CD4(+) T cell counts >/= 350 cells/microliter and viral load below the limits of detection for >/=1 year while on HAART were enrolled prospectively in a trial in which HAART was discontinued. Twelve of these patients had received prior IL-2 therapy and had low frequencies of resting, latently infected CD4 cells. Viral load relapse to >50 copies/ml occurred in all 18 patients independent of prior IL-2 treatment, beginning most commonly during weeks 2-3 after cessation of HAART. The mean relapse rate constant was 0.45 (0.20 log(10) copies) day(-1), which was very similar to the mean viral clearance rate constant after drug resumption of 0.35 (0.15 log(10) copies) day(-1) (P = 0.28). One patient experienced a relapse delay to week 7. All patients except one experienced a relapse burden to >5,000 RNA copies/ml. Ex vivo labeling with BrdUrd showed that CD4 and CD8 cell turnover increased after withdrawal of HAART and correlated with viral load whereas lymphocyte turnover decreased after reinitiation of drug treatment. Virologic relapse occurs rapidly in patients who discontinue suppressive drug therapy, even in patients with a markedly diminished pool of resting, latently infected CD4(+) T cells."
11545,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and recurrence are common in patients undergoing immunosuppression therapy. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockage therapy is effective for the treatment of many autoimmune inflammatory diseases. However, the role of TNF-α blockage therapy in the innate and adaptive immune responses against HBV is still not clear. A detailed analysis of HBV infection under TNF-α blockage therapy is essential for the prophylaxis and therapy for HBV reactivation and recurrence. In this study, HBV clearance and T-cell responses were analyzed in a HBV-transfected mouse model under anti-TNF blockage therapy. Our results demonstrated that under TNF-α blockage therapy, HBV viral clearance was impaired with persistent elevated HBV viral load in a dose- and temporal-dependent manner. The impairment of HBV clearance under anti-TNF-α blockage therapy occurred at early time points after HBV infection. In addition, TNF-α blockade maintained a higher serum HBV viral load and increased the number of intrahepatic programmed cell death (PD)-1(high)CD127(low) exhausted T cells. Furthermore, TNF-α blockade abolished Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand-induced facilitation of HBV viral clearance. Taken together, TNF-α blockade impairs HBV clearance and enhances viral load, and these effects depend on early administration after HBV infection. Our results here demonstrate that early TNF-α blockade reduces viral clearance and persistently maintains elevated HBV viral load in a mouse model, suggesting that HBV may reactivate during therapy with TNF-α-blocking agents."
9621,0.005,1.0000,"Antagonists of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor, CCR5, are being developed as the first anti-HIV agents acting on a host cell target. We monitored the coreceptor tropism of circulating virus, screened at baseline for coreceptor tropism, in 64 HIV-1-infected patients who received maraviroc (MVC, UK-427,857) as monotherapy for 10 days. Sixty-two patients harbored CCR5-tropic virus at baseline and had a posttreatment phenotype result. Circulating virus remained CCR5 tropic in 60/62 patients, 51 of whom experienced an HIV RNA reduction from baseline of >1 log(10) copies/ml, indicating that CXCR4-using variants were not rapidly selected despite CCR5-specific drug pressure. In two patients, viral load declined during treatment and CXCR4-using virus was detected at day 11. No pretreatment factor predicted the emergence of CXCR4-tropic virus during maraviroc therapy in these two patients. Phylogenetic analysis of envelope (Env) clones from pre- and posttreatment time points indicated that the CXCR4-using variants probably emerged by outgrowth of a pretreatment CXCR4-using reservoir, rather than via coreceptor switch of a CCR5-tropic clone under selection pressure from maraviroc. Phylogenetic analysis was also performed on Env clones from a third patient harboring CXCR4-using virus prior to treatment. This patient was enrolled due to a sample labeling error. Although this patient experienced no overall reduction in viral load in response to treatment, the CCR5-tropic components of the circulating virus did appear to be suppressed while receiving maraviroc as monotherapy. Importantly, in all three patients, circulating virus reverted to predominantly CCR5 tropic following cessation of maraviroc."
15195,0.005,1.0000,"Study GS-99-907 was a 48-week, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled intensification trial of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF). Antiretroviral-experienced patients added tenofovir DF 300 mg once daily to their existing regimen. The patterns of HIV-1 resistance development and the corresponding virologic responses were evaluated in a virology substudy at week 48. Although 94% of these treatment-experienced patients had nucleoside-associated resistance mutations (NAMs) at baseline, addition of tenofovir DF resulted in a mean reduction in viral load of -0.59 log10 copies/mL after 24 weeks that was durable through 48 weeks. Relative to the placebo-controlled arm, patients in the tenofovir DF arm had a reduced frequency of development of resistance mutations to all classes of HIV-1 inhibitors, with reduction in new protease inhibitor (PI)-associated mutations achieving statistical significance. The K65R mutation, which occurred in 8 patients (3%), was the only emergent mutation directly associated with tenofovir DF therapy. New thymidine analogue-associated mutations (TAMs) emerged in 19% of patients by week 48. Other than K65R, the patterns of mutations that developed were not significantly different between the tenofovir DF and placebo control arms, suggesting that the background therapies caused their development. The K65R mutation emerged only in patients with no detectable TAMs at baseline, whereas new TAMs developed similarly between patients with or without TAMs at baseline. Development of K65R was associated with mostly low-level changes in phenotypic susceptibility to tenofovir DF and other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and was not associated with viral load rebound. No novel patterns of genotypic or phenotypic resistance to tenofovir were identified. Therefore, intensification with once-daily tenofovir DF therapy resulted in a sustained reduction in HIV-1 viral load and a low risk for development of the K65R mutation in this treatment-experienced patient population."
4717,0.005,1.0000,"In New York City, federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are ideal partners for health departments because of their location in neighborhoods with high rates of HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and gonorrhea. Providers have experienced many barriers to following screening and treatment recommendations. In 2013, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene partnered with six FQHCs, representing 14 clinics, to make screening for HIV and HCV routine and increase adherence to gonorrhea treatment guidelines through education, electronic health record modification, and progress tracking. After one year, 12 of 14 clinics documented improvement in their HIV offer rate, and 11 clinics documented improvement in their HIV screening rate. Patients who were offered HIV screening increased from 26% at baseline to 56% at follow-up, and patients screened for HIV increased from 25% at baseline to 38% at follow-up. Most clinics improved their HIV screening rate, and progress suggests that local health departments can help FQHCs increase their HIV screening rates. "
3902,0.005,1.0000,"Negative interactions with health care providers can have important implications for the health and health care of HIV-positive individuals. The purpose of this study was to examine perceptions of race-based and socioeconomic status (SES)-based discrimination during interactions with HIV treatment providers. We recruited 110 individuals (17% female, 51% white) living with HIV from an AIDS service organization in a midwestern city. Results indicated that the majority of participants had perceived discrimination in their interactions with providers when getting treatment for HIV. More specifically, 71% reported having experienced discrimination when receiving treatment for HIV based on their race or color, and 66% reported discrimination attributed to their socioeconomic status, position, or social class. However, participants indicated that they experienced discrimination infrequently. No significant racial/ethnic differences in reports of discrimination were observed. In addition, greater race-based and SES-based discrimination were each associated with greater levels of depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms, greater severity of AIDS-related symptoms, lower perceived general health, and less health care satisfaction. Greater SES-based discrimination was also related to lower adherence to antiretroviral medications. Our findings suggest that experiences with discrimination when getting treatment have important implications for the health and health care of HIV-positive individuals. It is important to note, however, that discrimination based on HIV status or sexual orientation was not assessed and may have affected the results. Studies that explore perceptions of discrimination based on other factors among HIV-positive individuals may improve understanding of the nature, extent, and consequences of discrimination in patient-provider interactions."
11540,0.005,1.0000,"Weight loss and wasting are significant complications of HIV disease. HIV protease inhibitor therapy promotes clinical, immunologic and virologic improvement in HIV-infected patients. In this study, we sought to determine the specific effect of HIV protease inhibitors on patient weight. Ten consecutive HIV patients were treated with protease inhibitor-containing regimens over six months. CD4 T-cell counts, plasma viral load levels and bariatric changes were monitored during the study. Patients experienced a mean weight gain of 19 Pounds (P = 0.006). There was a significant increase in mean CD4 T-cell count (P = 0.008) and a significant decrease in mean viral load level (P = 0.004). The increase in CD4 T cells did not correlate with weight gain, whereas the decrease in viral load did show a significant correlation with the weight increase (P = 0.003). The mechanism of protease inhibitor-induced weight gain is discussed. The medications may also be useful for wasting diseases unrelated to HIV."
2301,0.005,1.0000,"Antitat is an autoregulated gene expressing an inhibitory RNA with dual function: it sequesters the Tat protein by polymeric-TAR and blocks the translation of the Tat messenger RNA by antisense-Tat. Using human T cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes as the in vitro target, we have previously shown that antitat is an effective long-term suppressor of HIV-1, including 'field' isolates. To assess the efficacy of this inhibitory gene better in the setting of an infected individual with late-stage AIDS, we examined its antiviral activity in an in vivo established infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from AIDS patients were transduced with replication defective retroviral vectors carrying the antitat gene. In the absence of cell selection, the antitat gene blocked virus replication and allowed infected CD4+ T cells to expand in culture. These results suggest that antitat gene therapy may be beneficial to block HIV-1 replication and reconstitute the immune system of late-phase AIDS patients. We introduced a new parameter, CRF, which defines the effectiveness of the ex vivo gene therapy treatment of AIDS patients. Antitat treatment was efficient in cells of all patients regardless of viral quasispecies, however, it was most potent in severely immunocompromised individuals."
12691,0.005,1.0000,"N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) has been proposed as an additional therapeutic agent for AIDS patients because it reduces human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in stimulated CD4+ lymphocytes, and it ameliorates immunological reactivity. In a randomized, 180-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed with HIV-infected patients classified as A2 and A3 according to the criteria of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, we investigated the effects of oral administration of NAC on HIV-infected patients undergoing their first anti-retroviral therapy; viral load, CD4+ lymphocyte, lymphocyte viability and apoptosis, and TNF-alpha and IL-8 levels were determined. Sixteen patients who received anti-retroviral therapy plus a placebo formed the control group and the study group consisted of 14 patients who received anti-retroviral therapy and NAC supplementation. A significant decrease was seen in viral load, TNF-alpha and IL-8 levels, and lymphocyte apoptosis, and a significant increase was found in levels of CD4+ lymphocytes and lymphocyte viability in both groups after anti-retroviral treatment, but no measurable benefits of anti-retroviral therapy plus NAC oral supplementation (600 mg/day) were found in relation to anti-retroviral therapy alone, and the baseline levels of cysteine and glutathione in plasma were not recovered by this treatment. In conclusion, the daily doses of NAC necessary for the total recuperation of plasma cysteine and glutathione levels in HIV-infected patients and the additional benefits following the supplementation of NAC in patients submitted to anti-retroviral therapy, need to be studied further."
5811,0.005,1.0000,"Mutation in Human Immunodeficiency Virus type-1 (HIV-1) is extremely rapid, a consequence of a low-fidelity viral reverse transcription process. The envelope gene has been shown to accumulate substitutions at a rate of approximately 1% per year and can frequently spend a long time in the host (approximately 10 years). The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) in HIV-1 is known to be different from that of the human host. However, by reengineering the protein coding sequences of HIV-1 to reflect the RSCU patterns observed in humans, a large increase in protein expression is observed. It is reasonable to suggest that within a host there may be a selective drive for change in the RSCU of HIV-1 towards human RSCU. To test this hypothesis we analyzed HIV-1 partial envelope sequences from eight patients sampled serially in time. For each sequence, an RSCU table was constructed. Sequences were labelled as ""early"" or ""late"" depending on whether they were sampled before or after the mid-point of the study. Using the RSCU values as descriptor variables, a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was performed. The first three components clearly discriminated between early and late sequences. We also constructed pooled groupwise RSCU tables for early and late sequences. The viral RSCU values of each of the groups were correlated with human RSCU. If there is selection for host-adaptation in RSCU, we expect that ""late"" viral RSCUs would tend to be more highly correlated with human RSCU than ""early"" viral RSCUs. In fact, tests of significance suggest that this is the case. However, closer examination of the data revealed that the apparent trend towards human RSCU can be attributed to the homogenization of the codon usage by mutation pressure rather than host adaptation."
15912,0.005,1.0000,"The epidemiology of HIV associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was investigated in 6550 European patients with AIDS. NHL was diagnosed in 3.5% of all patients at the time of the AIDS diagnosis. Although the probability of being diagnosed with NHL at AIDS diagnosis was significantly higher among intravenous drug users than among homosexual men, and was associated with increasing age, the observed incidences of NHL were more strikingly similar than any differences. The rate of developing NHL after a previous AIDS diagnosis was 2.4 per 100 patient years of follow-up, and remained constant during a 5-year follow-up period. While primary brain lymphomas comprised only 9% of NHL diagnosed at the time of AIDS, they comprised 38% of NHL diagnosed after AIDS (p < 0.001). The prognosis for patients with NHL at AIDS diagnosis was poor with a median survival of 5 months. A diagnosis of primary brain lymphoma was uniformly associated with a poor outcome. It is concluded that the probability of developing NHL in late stage HIV infection is lower than previously anticipated from the results of small studies on patients receiving long-term anti-retroviral therapy."

Little data is available on the response of children infected with hepatitis C treated with combination therapy, especially those with bleeding disorders. We wish to report a single paediatric haemophilia treatment center's results of treatment of adolescents with haemophilia and hepatitis C infection with combination therapy. All patients followed at the haemophilia treatment center with hepatitis C, who were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and had a measurable hepatitis C viral load were eligible. Study patients received at least 6 months of 3 MU interferon-alpha via subcutaneous injection three times per week and 1000 mg day(-1) of ribavirin. Eleven patients agreed to participate in the study. Three patients had an un measurable viral load after 6 months of combination therapy. All three completed 12 months of medication and continued to remain free of hepatitis C for 12 months after discontinuation of therapy. Side-effects of combination therapy were significant but tolerable. The sustained response rate in this study is similar to the historical response rate seen in adults but less than the other reported response rates seen in children treated with combination therapy. Given the toxicity of combination therapy, and natural history of hepatitis C infection in children, consideration of a liver biopsy to evaluate disease progression prior to considering antiviral medications is warranted."

The positive rate of HBsAg was 68.8 to 76.0% per year in patients with HCC, while that of anti-HCV was 3.2 to 9.8% per year. No sex predominance was found in the positive rates of HBsAg and anti-HCV. HBsAg positivity was distributed mostly in the 41 to 50 age group, whereas anti-HCV positivity was distributed mostly in the over 50 age group. Higher positive rate of anti-HCV was observed in HCC patients with serum ALT levels above the normal range than in those with serum ALT levels within the normal range. However, elevated serum ALT levels above the normal range was not related to the positive rate of HBsAg. The relatively low prevalence of anti-HCV in patients with HCC suggests that the role of HCV infection in the development of HCC lower than that of HBV infection in Korea. However, our results suggest that HCV is another potent risk factor for HCC even in HBV endemic areas."

Mortality and cause of death were analyzed in three treatment periods; pre-HAART (1990-1997), early-HAART (1998-2001), and late-HAART period (2002-2011). The patients were retrospectively classified according to the treatment period in which they were recruited. Although mortality rate per 100 person-year declined from 8.7 in pre-HAART to 4.9 in late-HAART period, the proportion of deaths within 3 months of initial visit to study hospital significantly increased from 15.9% in pre-HAART to 55.1% in late-HAART period (P < 0.001). Overall, 59% of deaths were attributable to AIDS-related conditions, and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) was the most common cause of death (20.3%). The proportion of PCP as cause of death significantly increased from 8.7% in pre-HAART to 31.8% in late-HAART period (P < 0.001).

Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. We identified negative and positive psychological themes associated with both drug use and adherence. Participants described tension between negative feelings (denial, shame, and perceived isolation) and positive feelings (acceptance, motivation, empowerment, and perceived connectedness), and they associated this tension with their own drug using and adherence behaviors. Sustained antiretroviral therapy adherence may require increased emphasis on understanding the psychological experience of HIV-infected drug users. "

This article evaluates the current state of the science in adherence to antiretroviral therapy for persons with HIV. The primary objectives are to 1) identify critical determinants of adherence, and 2) describe interventions to improve adherence. Adherence is a complex dynamic behavior influenced by characteristics of the patient, treatment regimen, disease, patient-provider relationship, and clinical setting. Therefore, the most promising interventions are multifaceted and target different locations in this matrix simultaneously. Unfortunately, nonadherence remains a formidable barrier in the management of HIV, resulting in the development of resistance and drug failure. Moreover, adherence is a public health concern, with implications for the transmission of HIV in general and the transmission of drug-resistant strains of HIV specifically. Despite substantial attention to adherence in recent years, much more remains to be done to better understand and promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy through effective interventions. From this integration of biomedical and behavioral science, effective clinical interventions can be developed and implemented to enhance the health of patients with HIV."

However, evidence is lacking on the causal effect of adherence on the outcomes. The goal of this study is to understand whether near perfect adherence is necessary to achieve optimal virologic outcome and also to investigate the effect of initial adherence to antiretroviral therapies on initial viral suppression by different regimens. A cohort study was conducted on HIV veterans initiating antiretroviral therapies in 1999 to 2015. The primary outcome was the first viral suppression occurred within 30 to 60 days since the index date. Multiple imputation was used to impute the missing value of virologic outcomes. The inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method was applied to estimate the viral suppression rate at each specific adherence category for each regimen category. Marginal structural models with IPTW were used to estimate the risk of viral suppression in lower-adherence categories in comparison to near-perfect adherence level ≥95%. Data showed that lower adherence caused lower viral suppression rate, with the association differentiated by the regimen. Patients on integrase strand transfer had the highest viral suppression rate, with patients on protease inhibitors having the lowest rate. Regardless of regimens, the viral suppression rate among patients at initial adherence of 75 to <95% was not statistically different from patients at adherence of ≥95%; however, the differences might be clinically significant."

The evidence suggests that poor adherence to antiretroviral drug therapy is a major problem that has the potential to diminish effective viral suppression, promote viral resistance, and place patients at risk for hospitalization, opportunistic infections, and an increased risk of HIV transmission. The primary aim of this study was to understand patients' experiences regarding their adherence to antiretroviral drug therapy. Thus, 19 participants were recruited for in-depth interviews regarding their adherence to drug regimens. All the interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by using Benner's phenomenological analysis approach. Four main themes emerged from the data: (i) choosing to live and the decision to start taking medications; (ii) strategies for adhering to the regimen and managing the side-effects; (iii) relationships with healthcare providers; and (iv) advantages of the medications as a motivator to continue one's adherence to the regimen. Studying and understanding the experiences of patients can provide new insights and strategies in order to enhance patients' adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy."

Generalized linear mixed-effect models found a significant decline in varenicline adherence from week 1-12 across treatment groups. At 12-weeks, the probability of smoking abstinence was significantly higher in SC+TM+ABT than in SC. The study demonstrates the feasibility of delivering adherence-focused interventions to PLHIV who smoke. Findings suggest intensive behavioral support is an important component of an effective smoking cessation intervention for this population, and a focus on improving adherence self-efficacy may lead to more consistent adherence and higher smoking abstinence."

The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of serological markers of syphilis, HIV-1/2, HTLV-I/II, HBV, and HCV infections among immigrant sex workers in Madrid, Spain and to characterize the HIV-1 variants in seropositive individuals. Sera from 762 immigrant commercial sex workers (75.3% from sub-Saharan Africa, 18.2% from South America, and 6.4% from Eastern Europe) were collected between 1998 and 2003 in Madrid and examined. Antibody detection was performed by screening assays (RPR, ELISAs) and confirmed by FTA-Abs, LIAs and Western-blot tests. HIV-1 subtyping was carried out by phylogenetic analyses of the protease and envelope genes. Antibodies to HIV-1 were found in 5.2%, while 3.5% tested positive for HBsAg, 3% for syphilis antibodies, 0.8% for HCV antibodies, and 0.2% for HTLV-I antibodies. None were reactive for HIV-2 or HTLV-II antibodies. HIV-1 seroprevalence among Africans and Ecuadorians was 4.5 and 10.9%, respectively. All HIV-1 seropositive Ecuadorians were transsexual men, and 28.6% had active syphilis infection. Up to 80% of HIV-1 positive specimens were characterized as non-B subtypes, with subtypes G, A, and G/A recombinants being the most frequent among African individuals. In contrast, South Americans with HIV-1 infection carried exclusively subtype B variants.

To identify factors associated with delayed presentation to medical care after testing HIV-positive or with late HIV testing, we studied 968 patients at their first HIV care visit, enrolled in a multicenter study in Italy from 1997-2000. Patients completed a questionnaire on HIV-testing history, sexual behavior, and drug use behavior. Delayed presenters were patients with >6 months between their first HIV-positive test and presentation for HIV care; late testers were patients with CD4 count < 200 /mm or clinically defined AIDS at their first HIV-positive test. Among the study patients, 255 (26.3%) were delayed presenters, and 280 (28.9%) were late testers. In multinomial logistic regression analysis, injection drug use significantly increased (odds ratio [OR]= 5.04) the probability of delayed presentation but reduced (OR = 0.55) the chance of late testing. A previous HIV-negative test was associated with a reduced risk of both delayed presentation (OR = 0.39) and late testing (OR = 0.36). Unemployment was positively associated with delayed presentation and increasing age with late testing, whereas HIV counseling at the time of first positive HIV test strongly (OR = 0.42) reduced the odds of delayed presentation. Interventions aimed at promoting timely access to care of HIV-infected persons should consider differentiated programs for delayed presentation and late testing."

Early GUD diagnosis and aggressive treatment of HIV-infected patients may significantly reduce secondary transmission of HIV to other sex partners."
5500,0.005,1.0000,"The clinical presentation of visceral leishmaniasis shares similarities with other geographically specific infectious diseases associated with AIDS in terms of relapsing course and atypical presentation. However, visceral leishmaniasis has not, until now, been included in the AIDS case definition. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical features and determinants for relapse and case-fatality of visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-infected patients from a Spanish Mediterranean area. A chart review was conducted in 16 hospitals in the autonomous communities of Valencia and Murcia (Spain). From 1988 to 2001, a total of 228 episodes of visceral leishmaniasis were diagnosed in 155 HIV-infected patients by the detection of amastigotes in bone marrow aspirates or in other tissue samples. Most patients had advanced HIV disease, with a median CD4(+) lymphocyte cell count of 55 cells x 10(9) l, and 56% of them had a previous AIDS-indicator disease. The median duration of follow-up was 8.4 months. HIV-infected patients with visceral leishmaniasis presented with fever (76%), hepatomegaly (77%), splenomegaly (78%), and varying degrees of cytopenias. Leishmania was detected in atypical sites in 22 (14%) patients. A total of 37 (24%) patients had a relapse of visceral leishmaniasis. Female gender was a risk factor for relapse, whereas administration of secondary prophylaxis for visceral leishmaniasis and a completed therapy for visceral leishmaniasis were protective factors against relapse. A total of 86 (54%) patients died. Independent determinants for survival were CD4(+) lymphocyte cell count, completed therapy for leishmania, and secondary prophylaxis for visceral leishmaniasis. The findings show that, in HIV-infected patients, visceral leishmaniasis occurs in late stages of HIV disease and often has a relapsing course. Secondary prophylaxis reduces the risk of relapse. Visceral leishmaniasis in the HIV-infected population should be included in the CDC clinical category C for the definition of AIDS in the same way that other geographically specific opportunistic infections are included."

All completed the dose-escalation phase of weekly dosing at 100-mg increments and received at least one maintenance dose, 100 mg below the patient's toxic dose, for 12 weeks. Dose-limiting toxicity occurred in 3 patients at 200-mg, 5 at 300-mg, and 3 at 400-mg dose levels. One tolerated the 500-mg dose without dose-limiting toxicity. Dose-limiting toxicities included fatigue, fever, malaise, increased transaminases, hypotension, vomiting, and depression. Seven of 12 completed 12 weeks of maintenance. At > or = 200 mg of imiquimod, all patients had biologic responses, measured by elevations in serum interferon, beta2-microglobulin, and neopterin levels.

The overall incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease was 11.3 cases per 100,000 person-years in adult patients without known HIV infection and 677 cases per 100,000 person-years in HIV-infected patients. This incidence remained stable over the study period. Clinical presentation, severity of illness, and number of recurrent episodes were similar in patients with CD4+ cell counts of >200 or < or =200 cells/ microL. Patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) were more likely to present with TMP-SMZ-resistant pneumococci than were those who were not receiving this agent (76.7% vs. 43.6%; P=.007).

We performed a retrospective analysis of HIV-infected patients with NHL and HL receiving care at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from January 1, 2000 until December 31, 2010. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc). Sixty-five HIV-infected patients with NHL and HL were identified. Patients with non-CNS NHL and HL presented with advanced disease (85% stage III or IV) and adverse prognostic features. Patients completed 87% of planned chemotherapy cycles, and 68% of patients completed stage-appropriate therapy. Dose reduction, interruption, and/or delay occurred during more than 25% of administered cycles in 64% of patients. Infectious complications, febrile neutropenia, and myelosuppression accounted for 78% of deviations from planned cumulative dose and dose intensity. Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) was associated with poor prognosis, but 2-year overall survival was 66% for all non-CNS lymphoma. Among patients surviving at least 2 years, 75% had CD4 count >200 cells/μl and 79% had HIV viral load <400 copies/ml at last follow-up.

While it is still unclear whether HCV affects the course of HIV infection, there is ample evidence that concurrent HIV infection accelerates the progression of fibrosis and liver-related morbidity and mortality in HCV-infected patients. The treatment of HCV infection in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection has improved during the last few years, but the outcome appears to be poorer than the outcome in HCV monoinfected patients. In this article the epidemiological and clinical aspects of HCV/HIV coinfection are described, and the four major treatment trials are reviewed."
1348,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with increased levels of peripheral T cell apoptosis. We aimed to study whether T cell apoptosis markers indicate pathways that may contribute to clinical progression in HCV monoinfected and HIV-HCV coinfected patients. Activation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathways was measured by levels of death receptor Fas, initiator caspase 8 and effector caspases 3 and 7 activity and Annexin V binding on peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells of HCV monoinfected and HIV/HCV coinfected patients, as well as healthy controls and HIV-infected, hepatitis B virus-infected and primary biliary cirrhosis disease controls. Association with liver fibrosis was assessed by biopsy or by transient elastography. HCV monoinfected and HIV-HCV coinfected patients displayed enhanced peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cell apoptosis. Caspase 8 activity was highest in HIV-HCV coinfection, without enhanced downstream activity of caspases 3 and 7. Level of peripheral T cell apoptosis was independent of liver fibrosis or other disease parameters in all disease groups. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway is upregulated in HCV monoinfection and HIV-HCV coinfection, but this is independent of liver disease severity. "
8173,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to assess whether hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection would affect the clinical and immunological outcome of HIV-infected patients following a simplification strategy. A prospective cohort of HIV-infected patients starting a ritonavir boosted darunavir monotherapy (mtDRV/rtv) was followed for 24 months. HCV infection was evaluated by HCV viremia and hepatic fibrosis. Immune activation was studied as HLA-DR CD38 coexpression on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and also the quantification of plasma sCD14 levels. Microbial translocation was studied by the plasma levels of 16S rDNA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A total of 150 HIV-infected patients were enrolled in this study, including 46 individuals also infected with HCV (30.6%). HIV/HCV coinfection did not decrease mtDRV/rtv efficacy, since similar rates of HIV-1 intermittent viremia (HCV: 26.6% vs. no-HCV: 34.7%) and episodes of virological failure (HCV: 22.2% vs. no-HCV: 11.2%, p-value = 0.381) were found. No major differences were found between both groups at baseline, although higher HLA-DR(+)CD38(+)CD4(+) T cell counts were found in the coinfected group (HCV: 6.65% vs. no-HCV: 4.55%, p-value = 0.032); this difference was maintained in the 24 months of follow-up. After the 24-month follow-up, both groups, HIV-monoinfected patients and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, presented similar immune activation and microbial translocation profiles. In conclusion, the use of a simplified mtDRV/rtv strategy compromises neither HIV nor HCV viremic control in coinfected patients, although a higher immune activation of CD4(+) T cells was found. "

This study seeks to explore the geographic and individual factors associated with starting ART on time. This retrospective study includes 15,734 HIV-positive adults initiating ART at two HIV clinics in Lilongwe, Malawi. The outcome was starting ART within two weeks of meeting ART eligibility as defined by the Malawi ART guidelines. Euclidean distance from patient neighbourhood to their clinic was calculated using Google Earth. Logistic regression models assessed factors influencing starting ART on time. Of 15,734 adults initiating ART, 8178 were from Lighthouse (LH) and 7556 were from Martin Preuss Center (MPC). Combined, 68.7% started treatment on time. Patients who were eligible for ART based on a CD4 cell count <250 cells/mm(3) versus WHO stage were less likely to begin ART on time at both LH (odds ratio [OR] 0.16; 95% CI 0.13-0.19) and MPC (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.21-0.28). Likelihood of starting on time decreased with each kilometer further from clinic location among LH patients (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.94-0.99); distance was not significant at MPC. In conclusion, predictors differed by clinic. Distance to clinic and type of eligibility for ART significantly influence starting ART on time. "

5685,0.005,1.0000,"Drug-resistant HIV-1 is a cause of growing clinical and public-health concern. In many patients, combination antiretroviral therapy fails to achieve complete viral suppression (virological failure). Continuing viral replication during therapy leads to the accumulation of drug-resistance mutations, resulting in increased viral load and a greater risk of disease progression. Patients with drug-resistant HIV-1 infection have three therapeutic options: a change to a salvage regimen with the aim of fully suppressing viral replication; interruption of therapy; or continuation of a partially effective regimen. The first strategy is preferred for most patients failing their first or perhaps their second regimen. However, the best approach remains unclear for patients who have failed multiple treatment regimens and who have limited options for complete viral suppression. The management of such patients requires a careful understanding of the pathogenesis of drug-resistant HIV-1, the clinical consequences of virological failure, the potential benefits and limitations of diagnostic assays, and the likelihood that agents in development will be effective."
12977,0.005,1.0000,"The transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through transplantation of human tissues and organs is rare but not impossible. A 27-year-old Bulgarian woman received a kidney transplant from a cadaveric donor owing to chronic renal failure due to glomerulonephritis of unknown etiology. Five days after the donation, the tissues showed HIV-1 infection, so she was immediately initiated on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with lopinavir/ritonavir, zidovudine, enfuvirtide, and lamivudine. Subsequently, according to the genotypic test which revealed a complex resistance pattern of the HIV-1, we changed the regimen to darunavir/ritonavir, etravirine, lamivudine, and enfuvirtide. The HIV-1 genome (550 UI/mL), which was detected at 5 days after transplantation, rapidly declined to undetectable levels at 3 weeks after HAART. The CD4+ T-cell nadir was 432 cells/microL (40%) to 1,400 cells/microL after 2 years. The posttransplantation course was complicated by cytomegalovirus pneumonia. At 32 months after transplantation, the patient had experienced hypertension with secondary retinopathy, bilateral cataracts, diabetes, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis with multiple vertebral fractures, a hip prosthesis, and a bone infarction of the femur. Major management problems had been related to steroid and HAART treatment side effects. Therapeutic interactions between the immunosuppressants and the antiretroviral drugs were complex for management, requiring frequent checks of drug levels and dose-adjustments. We finally obtained a stable clinical and viroimmunologic condition. The transmission of multiresistant strains of HIV from unknown patients requires complex multidisciplinary management."
13864,0.005,1.0000,We report two hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers who had liver failure after withdrawal of corticosteroids (steroids) administered for treatment of serious asthmatic attacks. Liver functions deteriorated 1 to 2 wk after withdrawal of the steroid therapy and liver failure occurred. Steroid readministration and intensive therapy for liver failure did not prevent death. An excessive immune response provoked by steroid withdrawal and decreased reserve capacity due to underlying chronic liver disease were thought to be factors in the liver failure. Caution must be exercised in the administration of steroids to patients with underlying chronic HBV infection to prevent exacerbation of hepatitis. Prompt readministration of steroids is indicated if evidence of liver failure develops.
10312,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1-infected patients with suppressed plasma viral loads often require changes to their antiretroviral (ARV) therapy to manage drug toxicity and intolerance, to improve adherence, and to avoid drug interactions. In patients who have never experienced virologic failure while receiving ARV therapy and who have no evidence of drug resistance, switching to any of the acceptable US Department of Health and Human Services first-line therapies is expected to maintain virologic suppression. However, in virologically suppressed patients with a history of virologic failure or drug resistance, it can be more challenging to change therapy while still maintaining virologic suppression. In these patients, it may be difficult to know whether the discontinuation of one of the ARVs in a suppressive regimen constitutes the removal of a key regimen component that will not be adequately supplanted by one or more substituted ARVs. In this article, we review many of the clinical scenarios requiring ARV therapy modification in patients with stable virologic suppression and outline the strategies for modifying therapy while maintaining long-term virologic suppression."

CD4 lymphocytes were selectively expanded in vitro by T cell receptor triggering, which also induces HIV production from latently infected cells. CD4 cell expansion and lack of virus production in cultures correlated well with clinical responses and were best in those receiving an aggressive antiretroviral three-drug regimen. Twelve clinical responders receiving triple-drug therapy monitored for 60 weeks had both excellent ex vivo CD4 cell expansion and lack of HIV replication, often in the absence of added drug in culture. Breakthrough viruses recovered from drug-containing arms of the cultures showed phenotypic resistance to the drugs used in vivo. This CD4 lymphocyte outgrowth assay correlates well with clinical outcome in subjects receiving potent antiretroviral regimens and may predict the emergence of early drug resistance."
734,0.005,1.0000,"The availability of an increasing number of antiretroviral agents and the rapid evolution of new information has introduced substantial complexity into treatment regimens for persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation convened the Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV to develop guidelines for clinical management of HIV-infected adults and adolescents (CDC. Report of the NIH Panel To Define Principles of Therapy of HIV Infection and Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected adults and adolescents. MMWR 1998;47[RR-5]:1-41). This report, which updates the 1998 guidelines, addresses 1) using testing for plasma HIV ribonucleic acid levels (i.e., viral load) and CD4+ T cell count; 2) using testing for antiretroviral drug resistance; 3) considerations for when to initiate therapy; 4) adherence to antiretroviral therapy; 5) considerations for therapy among patients with advanced disease; 6) therapy-related adverse events; 7) interruption of therapy; 8) considerations for changing therapy and available therapeutic options; 9) treatment for acute HIV infection; 10) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among adolescents; 11) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among pregnant women; and 12) concerns related to transmission of HIV to others. Antiretroviral regimens are complex, have serious side effects, pose difficulty with adherence, and carry serious potential consequences from the development of viral resistance because of nonadherence to the drug regimen or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents. Patient education and involvement in therapeutic decisions is critical. Treatment should usually be offered to all patients with symptoms ascribed to HIV infection. Recommendations for offering antiretroviral therapy among asymptomatic patients require analysis of real and potential risks and benefits. Treatment should be offered to persons who have <350 CD4+ T cells/mm3 or plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels of >55,000 copies/mL (by b-deoxyribonucleic acid [bDNA] or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] assays). The recommendation to treat asymptomatic patients should be based on the willingness and readiness of the person to begin therapy; the degree of existing immunodeficiency as determined by the CD4+ T cell count; the risk for disease progression as determined by the CD4+ T cell count and level of plasma HIV RNA; the potential benefits and risks of initiating therapy in an asymptomatic person; and the likelihood, after counseling and education, of adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. Treatment goals should be maximal and durable suppression of viral load, restoration and preservation of immunologic function, improvement of quality of life, and reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Results of therapy are evaluated through plasma HIV RNA levels, which are expected to indicate a 1.0 log10 decrease at 2-8 weeks and no detectable virus (<50 copies/mL) at 4-6 months after treatment initiation. Failure of therapy at 4-6 months might be ascribed to nonadherence, inadequate potency of drugs or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents, viral resistance, and other factors that are poorly understood. Patients whose therapy fails in spite of a high level of adherence to the regimen should have their regimen changed; this change should be guided by a thorough drug treatment history and the results of drug-resistance testing. Because of limitations in the available alternative antiretroviral regimens that have documented efficacy, optimal changes in therapy might be difficult to achieve for patients in whom the preferred regimen has failed. These decisions are further confounded by problems with adherence, toxicity, and resistance. For certain patients, participating in a clinical trial with or without access to new drugs or using a regimen that might not achieve complete suppression of viral replication might be preferable. Because concepts regarding HIV management are evolving rapidly, readers should check regularly for additional information and updates at the HIV/AIDS Treatment Information Service website (http://www.hivatis.org)."

We evaluated 41 patients with HBV-related PAN to determine the circumstances leading to infection, the clinical features of vasculitis, the prognostic factors, and the response to therapy. Most patients were first treated briefly with corticosteroids, and all were included in 2 nonrandomized prospective therapeutic trials of an antiviral agent (35 patients with vidarabine, 6 patients with interferon-alpha 2b) and plasma exchanges. The mean duration of follow-up was 69.6 +/- 44.8 months. At the end of the study, 21 (51.2%) patients had seroconverted to anti-HBeAb and 10 (24.4%) also had seroconverted to anti-HBsAb. In all, 23 (56%) patients no longer expressed serologic evidence of HBV replication. All 33 (80.5%) patients still alive at the end of follow-up recovered from PAN. Nineteen also recovered from HBV infection and were considered to be cured; 13 patients had persistent HBV infection and were considered to be in clinical recovery; and 1 patient was in remission, maintained with steroid therapy. Eight patients died during the study period; 3 deaths were directly attributable to PAN. HBV-related PAN is an acute disease, occurring shortly after infection and sharing the characteristics of classic PAN. It is not an antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA)-mediated vasculitis. The outcome was good for patients treated with short-term steroid therapy, antiviral agents, and plasma exchanges. We propose this protocol as the first treatment for HBV-related PAN, because it surpasses the conventional treatment with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, which facilitates viral replication and the development of chronic HBV infection."
18727,0.005,1.0000,"Among women with HIV infection, pregnancy is a time when maintenance of maternal health and reduction of vertical HIV transmission are primary concerns. Few studies have examined adherence to Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) during pregnancy and in the postpartum period when the demands of childcare may significantly interfere with women's self-care behaviors. This study examined ART use and adherence in HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women participating in the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS-IV) in the US. Adherence was assessed through a self-report interview during the third trimester of pregnancy and six-month postpartum. Data were also collected on demographics, biomedical markers and health related symptoms. During the third trimester visit, 77% (309/399) of women completed the self-report adherence measure; 61% (188/309) reported complete adherence. Factors associated with non-adherence included advanced HIV disease status, higher HIV-RNA viral load, more health-related symptoms and alcohol and tobacco use. At six-month postpartum, 55% (220/399) completed the measure; 44% (97/220) of these women reported complete adherence. Factors associated with non-adherence during the postpartum period were ethnicity, more health-related symptoms and WITS clinical site. Results of multivariate analyses using Generalized Estimated Equation analyses across the two visits revealed that more health-related symptoms, higher HIV-RNA viral load, increased alcohol use and clinical site were independently associated with ART non-adherence. These analyses indicate that medication adherence is more likely during pregnancy than postpartum in HIV-infected women, perhaps provoked by motivation to reduce vertical transmission and/or intensive antepartum surveillance. Further investigation is warranted to clarify factors implicated in women's decision-making process regarding ART medication adherence."

Primary outcomes included HIV disease progression, medical care access and utilization, treatment adherence, mental and physical health, and risks of transmitting HIV. Across three study sites, 630 participants completed baseline sessions and were randomized to receive either immediate rental housing assistance (treatment group) or assistance finding housing according to local standard practice (comparison group). Baseline sessions included a questionnaire, a two-session HIV risk-reduction counseling intervention, and blood sample collection to measure CD4 counts and viral load levels. Three follow-up visits occurred at 6, 12, and 18 months after baseline. Participants were mostly male, Black, unmarried, low-income, and nearly half were between 40 and 49 years old. At 18 months, 84% of the baseline sample was retained. The retention rates demonstrate the feasibility of conducting scientifically rigorous housing research, and the baseline results provide important information regarding characteristics of this understudied population that can inform future HIV prevention and treatment efforts."

The Medical Outcome Study-HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV); sleep, cognitive function, and depression scales; the Sickness Impact Profile Home Management Scale; and questions on HIV-related clinical symptoms were administered. Standard gamble utilities and categorical rating scale preferences were assessed for current health state. The MOS-HIV scale scores of asymptomatic patients were significantly higher than those of symptomatic patients and patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. No differences were observed for utilities. Increases in clinical symptoms over 4 months were associated with changes in health perception, pain, physical role function, social function, mental health, depression, energy, cognitive function, and categorical rating scale preferences.

13062,0.005,1.0000,"A problem arising in studies on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection relate to one-sided tests with ordered alternatives as opposed to the more classical two-sided tests. Patients not having a resistance mutation may have a better virologic response to treatment than patients with a single mutation. In turn, those with a single mutation may have a better response to treatment than those patients having two mutations, and so on. In the presence of a continuous outcome, Jonckheere's test for ordered alternatives is well adapted to this situation. Such an analysis does not provide any measure of prediction or explained variation which can complement these results. A measure of strength of effect would be helpful in quantifying the degree of association between the genotypic score (number of mutations) and some continuous virological response. We suggest a simple measure of 'goodness of split' for Jonckheere's test for trend. Interestingly, the measure can be related to the non-parametric measure of association known as gamma. The variance formula for the measure studied here can be seen to differ from the known variance estimate of the gamma measure, and simulations show it to be more accurate. Expectation and variance under H(0) of the measure are provided and a large simulation study is presented. Methods are applied to a recent clinical data set involving HIV-1 infected patients where the number of resistance mutations are investigated as potential predictors of the amount of HIV-1 RNA reduction at week 4."

The objective of this study was to evaluate three treatment adherence measures (caregiver reports, pharmacy refill, and appointment maintenance data) in association with viral load suppression in pediatric patients with HIV-1 infection. Although viral suppression was not found to be significantly associated with adherence defined by any single measure, treatment adherence could be predicted if all three measures were in agreement."
4156,0.005,1.0000,"Undernutrition is a frequent complication of evolutive and chronic HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection characterized by bodyweight loss and changes in body composition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define AIDS wasting as involuntary loss of more than 10% of body weight, plus more than 30 days of either diarrhea, or weakness and fever. Wasting syndrome has been considered as a case definition of the AIDS disease since 1987. Wasting syndrome is clearly linked to disease progression and death. Despite the progress under the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), wasting is still a problem for people with AIDS. A small part of the weight lost is fat. More important is the loss of ""lean body mass"", which is mostly muscle. Body composition changes during HIV infection are different from those observed in food deprivation. Under the era of HAART, a HIV-associated adipose redistribution syndrome (HARS) was described that associates subcutaneous lipoatrophy and abdominal obesity linked to various metabolic disorders. Several factors contribute to wasting syndrome. Not only low food intake and poor nutrient absorption, but mainly altered metabolism (increased resting energy expenditure) and specific disturbances in protein turnover, which is also increased. Nutritional evaluation of HIV-infected patients should include the measurement of body composition and analysis of nutritional parameters, including albumin, transthyretin and C-reactive protein. Transthyretin seems to be particularly useful to follow the recovery period of malnutrition."

Adherence is a challenge in all HIV infected people on ART. It is especially a concern in children because of factors relating to children such as age, disclosure status of HIV sero status, and understanding of the medication. This study assessed the level of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy and its associated factors among children in Gondar University Hospital and Gondar Poly Clinic, Northwest Ethiopia."
13914,0.005,1.0000,"The Brazilian public health system has implemented free, universal access to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy for HIV-infected patients. To evaluate this system, we performed a pilot study to determine whether ARVs were prescribed according to Brazilian guidelines in place in 2000, and whether prescriptions were refilled in a timely manner. Year 2000 data were abstracted from all medical and pharmacy records of adult patients first registered for HIV/AIDS care in a Rio de Janeiro public clinic from January to June 2000 (n = 67). Results were analysed using frequency analyses, chi-square tests and logistic regression. The patient sample was 41.8% female and had a mean age of 34.9 years. 54 (81%) had AIDS; total sample mean baseline CD4+/viral counts were 276 cells/mm3 and 237 517 copies per millilitre, respectively. Delays between clinic request and receipt of first CD4+/viral load results ranged from 25 to 107 (mean 66) and 33 to 139 (mean 86) days, respectively. Fifty-nine patients (88.1%) were prescribed ARV treatment. Forty-two regimens (71.2%) were highly active antiretroviral therapies; 17 (28.8%) were combination regimens with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. No combinations were prescribed that were contraindicated in Brazilian guidelines, however 33 patients (55.9%) were prescribed ARV drugs before one or both HIV status parameters (initial CD4+ level or viral load) were recorded. Fourteen patients prescribed ARVs (23.7%) lacked a supply of medication for >1 month during the year at least once. Of these patients, 11 had treatment lapses as a result of failure to pick up medications, and three lacked medication because of drug shortages. Medication lapses were associated with female sex, being hospitalized in 2000, and having more than two drugs in regimen, but were not associated with age, CD4+ level or use of ARVs before 2000. The results from this pilot study suggest conservative prescription of HAART, high practitioner adherence to guidelines, and some problems with refilling medications in a timely manner. Monitoring delays were identified as a structural limitation to optimal adherence to practice guidelines. Better access to monitoring-laboratory facilities and greater drug availability would improve programme success."
496,0.005,1.0000,"The goal of this project was to explore the connections between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients adherence to antiretroviral medication treatment regimens and their beliefs about and satisfaction with their primary care physicians. In-depth interviews were conducted with 28 HIV-positive patients. Results showed that most patients were extremely satisfied with their current primary care physicians. When patients were dissatisfied with their care, it was often because there was a mismatch between the patient's expectations of care and the physician's consultation style. Results also showed that good quality physician-patient relationships tended to promote adherence while lesser quality relationships impeded it. Findings suggest that strengthening and promoting the bonds between physicians and HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients should be an absolute priority, at both the interpersonal level of physician-patient interactions but also at the organizational level."
12338,0.005,1.0000,"The availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy has markedly improved the survival rate and quality of life in patients infected with HIV. At present, however, there is still no cure for HIV and those undergoing treatment have to do so for life. The use of antiretroviral drugs has been associated with several toxicities that limit their success. Some acute and chronic toxicities associated with these drugs include hypersensitivity reactions, neurotoxicity, nephropathy, liver damage, the appearance of body fat redistribution syndrome and the different metabolic alterations that accompany it. Some of these toxicities are family- or even drug-specific. Since not all patients that take a particular antiretroviral medication develop the adverse effect that has been attributed to that drug, it has therefore been postulated that there must be a genetically-conditioned individual predisposition to developing the adverse effect. Pharmacogenetics is the science that studies interindividual variations in the response to and toxicity of drugs due to variations in the genetic composition of individuals. Sufficient advances have been made in this discipline to allow this fertile field of research to move out of the basic science laboratory and into clinical applications. The present article reviews the investigations that have been published regarding the association between the genetic determinants of persons infected with HIV and the metabolic toxicity and chronic vascular consequences resulting from antiretroviral drugs. The influence of host genetic variants on dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, lipodystrophy and atherosclerosis are presented and discussed."
7718,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study is to examine the risk factors associated with the development of sensory neuropathy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients in 292 HIV+ patients recruited through a community-based sentinel survey. We determined the clinical and treatment factors associated with the presence of peripheral sensory neuropathy in HIV+ subjects at baseline examination, and at 1-year follow-up. Baseline examination was assessed with a logistic regression analysis controlling for age, education level, history of drug/alcohol use, and anti-retroviral treatment. The risk of developing new peripheral neuropathy at follow-up was determined using a Cox proportional hazard model analysis. At study entry, neuropathy (n=64) was associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) (i.e. ddC), and history of alcohol abuse. After 1-year follow-up, the development of neuropathy was predicted by AIDS, age (older subjects), and NRTI use. These findings indicated that AIDS, age, alcohol abuse/dependence, and anti-retroviral medication use are important predictors of motor/sensory peripheral neuropathy in the HIV infection. The peripheral neurotoxic effect of anti-retroviral medication should be taken into account in the design of long-term therapies."
8614,0.005,1.0000,"Our aim was to evaluate the quality of pulmonary surfactant, a nonspecific defence system, during the course of human immunodeficiency virus) infection. Protein and phospholipid composition were determined in 127 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from 89 HIV seropositive patients (54 acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), 35 non-AIDS) and 11 healthy controls. In all of the HIV BAL samples, biochemical abnormalities were found. In subjects with pulmonary infection or Kaposi's sarcoma, the phospholipid/protein ratio was decreased, mainly because of elevated protein levels (15.8 and 20, respectively, vs 7.2 mg.100 ml-1 for controls, p < 0.05). In subjects without obvious pulmonary involvement, phospholipid was decreased (1.3 +/- 0.2 vs 2.9 +/- 0.3 mg.100 ml-1 for controls, p < 0.001), whereas the protein was not altered. Phospholipid composition was also altered: the phosphatidylcholine percentage was decreased, whilst the other main phospholipids were increased. We conclude that the alveolar lining is altered, whatever the stage of HIV disease. In most patients, it results from an increase of vascular permeability, with an influx of serum proteins. However, changes in phospholipid composition suggest that, in some cases, surfactant is also altered."

Testing for chlamydial infection is not available. To gather information on pregnant women, a prevalence survey was conducted in Apia, Samoa, utilizing two prenatal hospital clinics. Pregnant (n=427) women were tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and for syphilis (n=441) by rapid plasmid reagin (RPR) and HIV (n=441) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results were: chlamydia 30.9% (132); trichomoniasis 20.8%; gonorrhoea 3.3%; syphilis 0.5%; and HIV 0%. Overall 42.7% had at least 1 STD. Young women aged <25 years were three times more likely to have a STD than older women (odds ratio=3.0, 95% confidence intervals 2.0, 4.5).

7584,0.005,1.0000,"Markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were measured in 465 non-drug-abusing heterosexually transmitted disease (STD) patients. HBV markers were found in altogether 70 persons, of whom 7 were HBsAg carriers. Those chronically infected were all born in HBV intermediate/high endemic areas. Gonorrhoea was the only STD that was correlated to an increased risk of HBV markers. Number of sexual partners, sex and age was not correlated with HBV infection, irrespective of country of origin. The risk of having HBV markers in an STD clientele in Copenhagen was highly dependent on the country of birth, as the prevalences were 7% (21/307) in persons born in Denmark, 19% (9/47) in those born in other low endemic areas and 36% (40/111) in those born in intermediate/high endemic areas. Falling incidence of gonorrhoea and other STD may render it difficult to point out risk factors indicative of HBV immunization in heterosexual STD patients. In low-risk countries, screening for HBV markers should however be offered to all immigrants and refugees as a part of an HBV immunization program."
5415,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is critical for reducing HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality. Food insecurity (FI) is emerging as an important barrier to adherence to care and treatment recommendations for people living with HIV (PLHIV), but this relationship has not been comprehensively examined. Therefore, we reviewed the literature to explore how FI may impact ART adherence, retention in medical care, and adherence to health care recommendations among PLHIV. We found data to support FI as a critical barrier to adherence to ART and to other health care recommendations among HIV-infected adults, HIV-infected pregnant women and their HIV-exposed infants, and child and adolescent populations of PLHIV. Associations between FI and ART non-adherence were seen in qualitative and quantitative studies. We identified a number of mechanisms to explain how food insecurity and ART non-adherence may be causally linked, including the exacerbation of hunger or ART side effects in the absence of adequate food and competing resource demands. Interventions that address FI may improve adherence to care and treatment recommendations for PLHIV. "

The main barrier to adherence as identified by participants in the study was the stigma associated with living with HIV, and thus with receiving AIDS treatment. A second barrier was the fact that some patients willfully decide to forgo treatment so that they could retain state disability benefits associated with a low CD4 count. Other barriers included the lack of finances for transport to clinics and food insecurity, especially when medication needed to be taken with food. These barriers to ART adherence are conceptualized in terms of Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory."
12893,0.005,1.0000,"A discordant response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) occurs when CD4 T cell counts are stable or increased over time despite persistently detectable HIV-RNA levels. In order to identify immunological factors affecting discordant treatment responses, a total of 27 HIV-infected patients were studied: (a) 10 naive patients (mean CD4+ = 101.5 cells/microl; mean HIV-RNA = 4.8 log10 copies/ml); (b) seven responder patients (mean CD4+ = 908.9 cells/microl); and (c) 10 discordant patients (mean CD4+ = 396.1 cells/microl; mean HIV-RNA = 5.4 log10 copies/ml). Five healthy blood donors were included as HIV-seronegative controls. The following parameters were evaluated: interleukin (IL)-15 production by monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) after stimulation with lypopolysaccaride (LPS) and Candida albicans; recall and HIV-1-specific antigen lymphocyte proliferation (LP). Increased levels of IL-15 production by MDDC after stimulation with LPS and C. albicans were found both in discordant patients and responder patients. Conversely, a strong reduction of IL-15 levels was observed in naive patients. Discordant patients developed positive LP responses to C. albicans and HIV-1 p24. LP in response to C. albicans and HIV-1 p24 was also positive in responder patients. Decreased LP response was found in naive patients. In conclusion, HIV-infected patients with discordant viro-immunological responses to HAART present increased levels of IL-15 production by MDDC and enhanced recall and HIV-1-specific antigen LP responses, suggesting an improvement in indices of immune function."

Food insecurity can act as a real barrier to adherence to both of these factors. Many people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) treated with ART in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are faced with nutritional challenges. A significant proportion are affected by under nutrition, which frequently leads to therapeutic failure. Some HIV care facilities recommend supplementation with Moringa oleifera (M.O.)

Hence, this study was planned to investigate the effects of fish oil on lipid profile, insulin resistance, and body fat distribution in HIV-infected Brazilian patients on antiretroviral therapy, considering that marine omega-3 fatty acids seem to improve features of the metabolic syndrome. We conducted a randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled trial that assessed the effects of 3 g fish oil/day (540 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid plus 360 mg of docosahexaenoic acid) or 3 g soy oil/day (placebo) on 83 HIV-infected Brazilian men and non-pregnant women on antiretroviral therapy. No statistically significant relationships between fish oil supplementation and longitudinal changes in triglyceride (p = 0.335), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.078), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.383), total cholesterol (p = 0.072), apolipoprotein B (p = 0.522), apolipoprotein A1 (p = 0.420), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/apolipoprotein B ratio (p = 0.107), homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance index (p = 0.387), body mass index (p = 0.068), waist circumference (p = 0.128), and waist/hip ratio (p = 0.359) were observed.

12918,0.005,1.0000,"Treated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is characterized by ectopic fat deposition, a persistent inflammatory state, and increased cardiometabolic risk. In this secondary analysis of a placebo controlled trial of rosuvastatin among 147 HIV+ subjects (median age 46; 78% men) on stable antiretroviral therapy, we aimed to evaluate longitudinal associations between computed tomography (CT) measures of pericardial fat (PCF) volume and density, insulin resistance, and inflammation. We measured PCF volume and density (mean attenuation in Hounsfield units) by noncontrast gated CT at baseline and week 96. Homeostatic model of insulin resistance was calculated from fasting insulin and glucose at entry, 24, 48, and 96 weeks. At baseline, insulin resistance correlated positively with PCF volume and negatively with density. Similarly divergent correlations of volume and density were observed with waist:hip ratio, nadir CD4+ count, and duration of antiretroviral therapy. In a linear mixed model, PCF density was associated with insulin resistance independent of PCF volume, body mass index, metabolic syndrome, and biomarkers of immune activation and systemic inflammation; however, baseline PCF measures were not associated with longitudinal changes in insulin resistance. Soluble CD163, a marker of monocyte activation, positively correlated with PCF volume and was associated with insulin resistance in linear models. Statin treatment assignment did not affect PCF volume or density change (both p > 0.8). In conclusion, the quantity and quality (i.e., radiodensity) of PCF are differentially related to insulin resistance and inflammation in patients with treated HIV infection."
15595,0.005,1.0000,"B-lymphocyte dysfunction is a characteristic feature of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and of the AIDS-related complex. The aim of the present study was to further examine the influences exercised by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; formerly called human T-lymphotropic virus type III or lymphadenopathy-associated virus, HTLV-III/LAV) on normal human B lymphocytes. An unfractionated protein preparation, made from HIV purified by density gradient centrifugation, was previously shown to induce differentiation of normal human B lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. In the present analyses, this B-lymphocyte response peaked on day 6 or 7 after culture initiation and was found to be independent of the requirement for monocytes but to require T cells. Responses could also be elicited in cultures of purified B cells by the addition of T cells that had been exposed to HIV antigen. Inhibitors of protein synthesis (puromycin and cycloheximide) abrogated the responses. In contrast to its stimulatory effects, the same virus preparation was previously shown to inhibit polyclonal responses that are normally elicited in peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures by a T-dependent stimulus (pokeweed mitogen) and T-independent stimulus (Epstein-Barr virus). The present studies suggest that the inhibitory effects of the HIV antigen studied herein are targeted primarily at the B lymphocytes. The role of T lymphocytes in the HIV antigen-mediated inhibitory effects, although demonstrated, could not be conclusively established as an essential pathway. These findings elucidate mechanisms by which components of HIV exert stimulatory as well as inhibitory effects on human B lymphocytes and thereby lead to the dysfunction of these cells in HIV infection."

Significant clinical benefits and adverse experiences have been reported from this trial. Because neuropsychiatric dysfunction is often associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a brief affective and neuropsychological examination was administered over 16 weeks of the trial to evaluate any changes in neuropsychological function that occurred with drug administration. Patients receiving zidovudine, particularly those with AIDS, showed improved cognition as compared with patients receiving placebo. There were no changes in affective symptoms. The zidovudine recipients also had a statistically significant reduction in the intensity of symptomatic distress during the trial that may account in part for the observed cognitive changes. Some improvement in various cognitive measures was also seen in patients with AIDS-related complex. The results of this study suggest HIV-associated cognitive abnormalities may be partially ameliorated after the administration of zidovudine."

Data were collected from clinical charts and inserted into a computerized database. We evaluated the following outcome measures: probability of interruption of FTC-regimen due to side effects; time to virologic suppression in patients with detectable viral load at baseline; time to loss of virologic efficacy in patients with virologic suppression at baseline, immunologic variations. In the period January 2005- March 2006, overall 150 patients started a FTC-regimen; 16.7% of them were naïve to antiretroviral treatment.

A single-center, retrospective chart review of co-infected patients was conducted from June 2014 to February 2015. Significant interactions between simeprevir (SMV), ledipasvir (LDV), and paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir plus dasabuvir (3D regimen) with ART were identified based on available literature. SMV had the largest number of DDIs and was further investigated to determine the feasibility of ART switch to allow for DAA use. Of 127 subjects, 23% had advanced liver disease; 86% of those with known HCV genotype were HCV genotype 1. An ART switch allowing use of SMV, LDV, and 3D regimen was recommended in 97/127 (76%), 81/127 (64%), and 91/127 (72%) patients, respectively. Subjects on PI/r regimens had limited options for ART switch, with 40% of these patients unable to be switched to an ART regimen that avoided the use of a PI. In conclusion, the majority of HIV/HCV co-infected patients will be recommended to switch ART prior to use of interferon-free, DAA regimens, and an ART switch may not be feasible for more than a third of patients on a boosted PI. DDIs between ART and DAAs represent an additional barrier to treatment efficacy in clinical practice settings that are unaccounted for in clinical trials."

In patient-level analysis, adjusted hazard ratios for death dropped precipitously for all races to a low of 0.18 (95% confidence interval: 0.15 to 0.23) at 72 months of exposure to HAART. Hazards for serious cardiovascular events remained near 1.0 for exposure to HAART, and hazards for serious cardiovascular events, stroke, or death were only slightly higher than for death alone.

Approximately 60% of the participants had prehypertension to stage 2 hypertension. In the base model, older patients (P<.0001), men (P=.003), and patients with poorer self-reported health (P=.029) were significantly associated with high SBP, whereas older age (P<.001) and higher body mass index (P<.001) were significantly associated with higher DBP. After adjusting for the base model, high frequency of alcohol drinking and high frequency of binge drinking remained significant for high SBP and DBP.

A clustering of such factors (metabolic syndrome [MSDR]) exponentially increases the risk. Impaired fibrinolysis and increased coagulation are additional independent risk factors for CHD. We studied the effects of protease inhibitor (PI)-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on metabolic and hemostatic parameters in 363 HIV-infected individuals, of whom 266 were receiving PI-containing HAART and 97 were treatment naive. The fasting plasma levels of insulin, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), and fibrinogen were evaluated together with the areas of visceral adipose tissue and the visceral adipose tissue/subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio. The levels of insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; visceral adipose tissue area; low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein ratio; and visceral adipose tissue/subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio were significantly increased in patients receiving PI-containing HAART compared with treatment-naive patients. The levels of PAI-1 and fibrinogen were significantly higher in patients receiving PI-containing HAART. PAI-1 levels were higher in individuals with MSDR but also in patients without MSDR who were receiving PI-containing HAART. PAI-1 was independently correlated to use of PI-containing HAART, triglyceride level, insulin level, and body mass index (p <.001). These findings suggest that patients receiving PI-containing HAART have decreased fibrinolysis and increased coagulability, which may thus represent additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease in this patient group."
15069,0.005,1.0000,"Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has markedly improved survival in HIV-infected patients, but not without significant adverse effects including ART-associated dyslipdemia and insulin resistance, which may in part contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Other contributing factors to cardiovascular risk may include uncontrolled HIV replication, the effects of HIV and ART on vascular endothelium and inflammatory cytokines. Diastolic dysfunction may be an early sign of cardiovascular disease. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of diastolic dysfunction in HIV-infected patients without cardiovascular symptoms. We enrolled 91 subjects in a cross-sectional study of HIV-infected patients without cardiovascular symptoms between September 2004 and August 2005, to assess whether demographics, HIV-related factors, cardiac risk factors, and ART were associated with diastolic dysfunction. All subjects underwent two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography with tissue Doppler imaging. Subjects were predominately male with a median age of 38 (interquartile range [IQR]: 33, 42) years and median ART duration 6.15 (IQR: 2.1, 8.4) years. Subjects had low Framingham risk scores. Diastolic dysfunction was observed in 34 patients (37%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 27.4, 48.1). Cardiac risk factors or poor prognostic indicators of AIDS progression were uncommon with no difference between subjects with or without diastolic dysfunction. A nonstatistically significant trend in increased rate of diastolic dysfunction was observed in patients receiving protease inhibitors 1 year or more, 44% versus 28%, respectively (univariate odds ratio 2.02, 95% CI 0.83 to 4.90). This was not observed with prolonged use of either non-nucleoside or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. A high prevalence of diastolic dysfunction (37%) in a cohort of HIV-infected patients on ART at low risk for AIDS and cardiovascular disease was demonstrated."

Clinical examinations and iron and vitamin B(12) assays were performed, and complete blood counts, serum folic acid levels, and CD4 cell count determined. The prevalence of anemia was significantly higher among HIV-positive women (29%) than among HIV-negative women (8%) (P < 0.001). Risk factors for anemia were lower body mass index (odds ratio [OR] = 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.4-4.1), zidovudine use (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.01-1.29), lack of HAART (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.21-1.67), oral candidiasis (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.2-1.6), pulmonary tuberculosis (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.7-2.2), cryptococcal meningitis (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.21-1.8), Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.20-1.65) and CD4 lymphocyte count < 200 cells/μL (OR = 2.41, 95% CI = 2.01-3.07). The mean ± SD hemoglobin level of 10.9 ± 1.6 g/dL at HAART initiation significantly increased to 12.3 ± 1.5 g/dL in 8 months (P < 0.001). Anemia increases with HIV stage, and HAART is associated with a significant improvement in hemoglobin levels."
9976,0.005,1.0000,"The factors influencing virological response to first-line combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) in an Italian cohort of HIV-1-infected patients were examined. Eligible patients were those enrolled in a national prospective observational cohort (Antiretroviral Resistance Cohort Analysis), starting first-line cART between 2001 and 2011 and who had at least one follow-up of HIV-1 RNA. The primary endpoint was virological success, defined as the first viral load <50  copies/ml. Time to events were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard model. One thousand three hundred five patients met the study inclusion criteria. In a multivariable model adjusting for transmission mode, presence of transmitted drug resistance, baseline CD4(+) cell count, viral subtype, and type of NRTI backbone employed, independent predictors of virological success were higher baseline viral load (≥500,000 vs. <100,000 HR 0.52; P < 0.001), a weighted genotypic susceptibility score (wGSS) <3 (HR 0.58; P = 0.003), male sex (HR 0.76 P = 0.001), and type of initial third drug employed (integrase inhibitor vs. boosted protease inhibitors HR 3.23; P < 0.001). In the subset with HIV-1 RNA >100,000  copies/ml, virologic success was only associated with the use of integrase inhibitors in the first cART regimen. Independent predictors of immunological success were baseline CD4(+) cell count and wGSS <3. High baseline HIV-1 RNA, predicted activity of the first-line regimen based on genotypic resistance testing, gender, and use of new agents were found to predict time to achieve virological success. The type of initial nucleoside analog backbone was not found to predict virological response."

We investigated the prevalence of pruritus and its causes in this population by offering the possibility of participating in a skin health programme to all HIV-infected patients who attended our service in Alicante, Spain. Those who accepted (n = 303) underwent an interview and a detailed physical examination by specialists from the Dermatology Department. Between May 2003 and October 2003, 94 patients (31%) reported pruritus: xerosis, seborrhoeic eczema and interdigital tinea pedis were the most frequent dermatological entities responsible for this symptom. Patients with pruritus had higher viral loads (P = 0.006). We conclude that pruritus is still a frequent symptom in HIV-infected patients. To the best of our knowledge this is the first prevalence study of pruritus in an HIV population in the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era."

Very high, persistent levels of plasma RNA and proviral DNA were detected throughout the study period, suggesting the absence of an effective immune response. Most patients had normal CD4 lymphocyte counts and were symptom free for the first 3 to 6 months despite high levels of viral replication. These findings support the evaluation of early intervention (before symptoms develop) and efforts to establish the predictive value of these assays."

As of December 31, 1991, 238 HIV-infected children (classified P-1 or P-2 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification system) were identified. Median symptom-free survival time from birth to symptomatic infection (P-2) was different for perinatally acquired (n = 166) and neonatal transfusion-acquired (n = 72) infection (6.4 months vs. 17.8 months, respectively; P < 0.001). Survival after development of symptomatic infection (P-2) did not differ by transmission mode. Survival differences from birth to death were significant at P < 0.05 (75% of perinatally HIV-infected children survived 44 months vs. 71 months for transfusion-associated children). Although survival estimates improved for those receiving antiretroviral treatment, differences by mode were still observed. For perinatally HIV-infected children, mortality was highest in the first year of life (12%). Those remaining symptom-free beyond their first year demonstrated survival experiences similar to those for children with transfusion-associated infection."

Few studies have evaluated risk factors for TB treatment default in HIV-infected patients. We conducted a prospective, observational study of HIV-infected TB patients in Thailand. Patients underwent standardised evaluations at the beginning of TB treatment, at the end of the intensive phase and at the end of TB treatment. TB treatment outcomes were assessed according to WHO guidelines. The analysis was limited to patients who defaulted or who had treatment success. Of the 554 patients analysed, 61 (11%) defaulted. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with TB treatment default included incarceration history [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.7), smoking (AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-4.1) and having a symptom complaint score >15 (AOR 3.4, 95% CI 1.4-8.0); one marker of wealth, namely owning a refrigerator, was protective (AOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8). Default during TB treatment was a significant problem in HIV-infected patients. Reducing default may require enhancing services for patients with a history of incarceration or smoking and designing patient-centred systems to address poverty and patient wellness."

A multivariate analysis of post-HAART initiation exposures found that high HIV RNA levels (relative hazard [RH] = 1.36, P < 0.001) and high depressive symptom scores (RH = 1.53, P = 0.012) were associated with HAART discontinuation. The adjusted hazard of discontinuation was higher in the 2 most recent calendar periods compared with the first (RH = 1.61, P = 0.026; RH = 1.56, P = 0.074, respectively). The increasing risk of HAART discontinuation in recent calendar periods and changes in the clinical factors associated with discontinuation reflect ongoing and dynamic shifts in the approach to HAART utilization."
6684,0.005,1.0000,"Certain maternal/infant pairs, as well as other high-risk adults, develop a host-response HIV-1 infection characterized by circulating and tissue infiltrative CD8 T-cell lymphocytosis, termed Diffuse Infiltrative Lymphocytosis Syndrome (DILS). DILS primarily occurs in the salivary glands, lungs, renal interstitium, and gastrointestinal tract. DILS differs from Sjogren's syndrome in the degree of salivary gland enlargement, high frequency of extraglandular manifestations, paucity of autoantibodies, and distinct immunogenetic associations. Salivary gland B-cell lymphoma is a complication common to both conditions. The circulating CD8 T cells in DILS have a memory phenotype. Egress into target tissues involves adhesion molecule receptor-ligand interactions, apparently in response to the local presence of HIV-1. Immunogenetic predisposition involves interaction between both MHC classes I and II loci. This disease appears to reflect a specific host response that leads to persistence of monocyte-tropic, rather than T-cell-tropic, HIV-1 strains, in an analogous fashion to Visna Maedi virus disease in sheep. The development of DILS in children appears to be regulated in a dominant fashion by maternally or paternally inherited MHC class II alleles in response to transplacentally or perinatally acquired maternal HIV-1 strains."
8559,0.005,1.0000,"Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a circulating pattern recognition molecule involved in the innate immune system that mediates phagocytosis and activates complement by binding to a carbohydrate extremity. Some MBL genetic polymorphisms result in deficient protein levels and increased susceptibility to infection. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between MBL2 exon 1 polymorphisms, serum levels of normal MBL, and HIV-1 infection and progression in a Chinese population. A total of 1075 adult patients infected with HIV-1 (532 male and 543 female) were recruited. The genotype of 145 patients was determined and the genotype frequencies compared with healthy population controls. The disease status of patients was evaluated for different MBL2 genotypes and normal MBL serum levels. MBL2 exon 1 polymorphisms (A/O or O/O) were significantly more common in HIV-1-infected patients than in the healthy controls. Patients in clinical categories B/C with severe diseases were significantly more likely to have one variant allele. There was a statistical relationship between MBL2 genotypes and MBL serum levels. In addition, higher CD4(+) T cell counts and ratios of CD4(+) T cells:CD8(+) T cells were observed in patients with medium MBL levels than with low or high MBL levels. Patients with mild diseases were also more likely to have medium MBL levels than high levels. Analysis of MBL levels with respect to sex yielded differences. Median MBL levels were substantially higher in males than in females in HIV-1-infected patients. Lower CD4(+) T cell counts were detected in males with low MBL levels, but the opposite was observed in females. Our results suggest that genetic polymorphisms resulting in MBL deficiency are associated with increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and disease progression in the studied population. Moreover, serum circulating levels of normal MBL in HIV-1-infected patients could be an important auxiliary biological marker in association with CD4(+) T cell counts in the evaluation of HIV-1 disease progression. The sex differences in the regulation of MBL serum levels during infection merit further exploration."
7959,0.005,1.0000,"The landscape of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is changing with the increasing coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Patients are living longer but continually exposed to a virologically suppressed HIV infection. This has resulted in a decrease in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complications such as opportunistic infections, and an increase in non-AIDS complications such as stroke. In this era, stroke is perhaps the most important neurologic complication of HIV infection. Furthermore, stroke is more of a heterogeneous disease in people living with HIV infection and therefore needs to be approached systematically. Many of the etiologies are treatable. HIV-associated vasculopathy is perhaps the most common etiology in this population and our understanding of this is still evolving. Moreover, the treatment of HIV infection may contribute to an excess risk of stroke and interact with stroke therapies."

Infection of mononuclear phagocytes from healthy individuals by virulent MTB is associated with expression of the antiapoptotic molecule protease inhibitor 9 (PI-9), and PI-9 contributes to successful parasitism of macrophages by MTB.

4807,0.005,1.0000,"The levels of soluble form of E-Selectin (sEs), or endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, were measured in 96 sera derived from 72 HIV-infected patients at different stages of the disease, 60 healthy blood donors, and 50 HIV-negative patients with infections, using a quantitative ELISA. Levels of sEs in HIV-infected individuals without AIDS, according to the 1993 classification system of the Centers for Disease Control, were higher than normal (mean +/- SEM 48 +/- 4 versus 35 +/- 3 ng/ml, p = 0.003). Patients with established AIDS, who were afebrile and had no evidence of acute concurrent infection, had even higher sEs serum levels (70 +/- 9 ng/ml, p = 0.009, compared to those without AIDS). A significant increase in clinical category disease progression was present. Individual concentrations of sEs correlated directly with levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (p < 0.00001) and IL-2 receptor (p = 0.001), but not with CD4+ T-cell counts. Zidovudine treatment was not associated with changes in sEs serum levels. Elevated sEs levels were also found in HIV-seronegative patients with other bacterial and protozoal infections. Since sEs is a biologically active molecule, further studies should investigate the pathogenetic significance of circulating sEs in HIV-related disease progression, and assess the prognostic value of sEs determination for these patients."
4704,0.005,1.0000,"In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, the proportion of circulating mononuclear cells (PBMCs) which carry HIV provirus and the number of HIV proviral sequences per infected PBMC have been matters for conjecture. Using a double polymerase chain reaction which allows the detection of single molecules of provirus and a method of quantifying the provirus molecules, we have measured provirus frequencies in infected individuals down to a level of one molecule per 10(6) PBMCs. As a general rule, only a small proportion of PBMCs contain provirus (median value of samples from 12 patients, one per 8,000 cells), and most if not all of the infected cells carry a single provirus molecule. The frequency of provirus-carrying cells correlated positively both with the progression of the disease and with the success with which virus could be isolated from the same patients by cocultivation methods. Of seven asymptomatic (Centers for Disease Control stage II) patients, all but one contained one provirus molecule per 6,000 to 80,000 cells; of five Centers for Disease Control stage IV patients, all but one contained one provirus molecule per 700 to 3,300 cells. When considered in conjunction with estimates of the frequency of PBMCs that express viral RNA, our results suggest that either (i) the majority of provirus-containing cells are monocytes or (ii) most provirus-containing lymphocytes are transcriptionally inactive. We also present nucleotide sequence data derived directly from provirus present in vivo which we show is not marred by the in vitro selection of potential virus variants or by errors introduced by Taq polymerase. We argue from these data that, of the provirus present in infected individuals, the proportion which is defective is not high in the regions sequenced."
13630,0.005,1.0000,"Previous studies suggested that peripheral blood monocytes (Mo) from HIV-infected patients were poor accessory cells (AC), although most of these studies were limited by using autologous T cells as responders. Using allogeneic T cells from uninfected volunteers as responders, the current studies demonstrate that Mo from infected individuals were comparable to Mo from uninfected volunteers as AC in Con A and pokeweed mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation assays, but were inferior to normal Mo in stimulating a mixed leukocyte reaction. This deficiency was not explained by HIV Mo-induced suppression of lymphoproliferation or by death of responding CD4 lymphocytes induced by HIV transmission from infected Mo in 6-day MLR cultures. Mo from HIV-infected patients retained the ability to stimulate mumps-specific T cell lines in response to antigen, demonstrating that Mo from these individuals could process and display antigen on their cell surface in association with a functional DR molecule. Taken together these results suggest that Mo from HIV-infected patients (i) retain the ability to act as AC in T cell responses to mitogenic signals or to stimulate already activated antigen-specific T cells, but (ii) fail to stimulate resting and/or unprimed T cells in response to alloantigen and perhaps de novo antigen exposure. It is possible this Mo defect may have an adverse effect on the immune responsiveness of HIV-infected individuals."

Although other hCD4-containing chimeras cytotoxic to HIV-infected cells have been developed, there is limited information regarding their receptor binding and internalization. Therefore, the goals of this study were to purify the StxA1-hCD4 fusion protein, identify the receptor(s), and investigate the cytosolic trafficking route used by the chimeric toxin. Sufficient quantities of the StxA1-hCD4 hybrid were isolated for this investigation by using the pET expression and purification system. Cos-1 cells were rendered sensitive to the StxA1-hCD4 chimera by transfection with the env gene, which encodes HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins. The entry and translocation pathway used by the StxA1-hCD4 hybrid toxin was investigated by assessing the protective capacities of chemical reagents which interfere with microfilament movement, acidification of endosomes, and the integrity of the Golgi apparatus. Our findings indicated that the chimera uses HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120, and perhaps gp41, as a receptor which directs its entry through receptor cycling. Uptake is pH independent, and the StxA1-hCD4 hybrid is apparently translocated to the Golgi complex as with other bipartite toxins."
12607,0.005,1.0000,"A prominent feature of HIV infection is a progressive anergy of T cells and an increase of activation-dependent T-cell death. CD80 (B7.1), the ligand of CD28, is an important co-stimulatory molecule on antigen-presenting cells that delivers an essential second signal for T-cell activation. To test whether immunologic dysfunction in HIV disease involves CD80, we studied CD80 expression on circulating monocytes in heparinized whole blood of 33 HIV-infected patients and 13 controls. Most monocytes in patients and controls expressed significant amounts of CD80. There was no statistical difference of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD80 expression when all HIV-infected patients were compared with healthy controls. However, asymptomatic patients in clinical Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stage A showed a significantly stronger CD80 expression than did healthy controls. Additionally, patients receiving antiretroviral therapy exhibited significantly higher CD80 expression than did patients not receiving therapy and healthy controls. We did not find a correlation with the presence of HIV p24 antigenemia and counts of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Although we studied CD80 expression only on circulating monocytes and not in HIV-infected monocytes or in activated macrophages, our data do not support a role for a general impairment of CD80 expression in induction of anergy in HIV disease."

This cross-sectional study aimed to highlight socioeconomic predictors of adherence behavior among a cohort of 242 adult Malaysian patients receiving antiretroviral therapy in Hospital Sungai Buloh, Malaysia, where they were enrolled in a parent study (single-blinded randomized controlled trial) between January and December 2014. Statistical analysis of secondary data on adherence behavior and sociodemographic characteristics of the patients revealed mean age of 33.4 years and ranged from 18 to 64 years; 88.8% were males. A total of 224 (93%) patients who completed 6 months' adherence assessment were included in the model. Of these, 135 (60.3%) achieved optimal adherence. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis revealed that patient's income and ethnicity were significant predictors of adherence behavior.

HIV-infected patients in Uganda completed quarterly visits for 1 year, or one visit at 6 months, depending on study randomization. Past month ART non-adherence was less than daily or <100 % on a visual analog scale. Participants were asked if people who take alcohol should stop taking their medications (belief) and whether they occasionally stopped taking their medications in anticipation of drinking (behavior). Visits with self-reported alcohol use and ART use for ≥30 days were included. We used logistic regression to examine correlates of the interactive toxicity belief and behavior, and to determine associations with ART non-adherence. 134 participants contributed 258 study visits. The toxicity belief was endorsed at 24 %, the behavior at 15 %, and any non-adherence at 35 % of visits. In multivariable analysis, the odds of non-adherence were higher for those endorsing the toxicity behavior [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.06; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.97-4.36] but not the toxicity belief (AOR 0.63; 95 % CI 0.32-1.26). Clear messaging about maintaining adherence, even if drinking, could benefit patients."

Adherence rates of >/=95% were reported by 66% of the patients. In multivariate analyses, patients with lower rates of adherence tended to be younger (odds ratio [OR], 1.69), to be active drug users (OR, 2.27), to have detectable virus load levels (OR, 2.00), and to have a lower quality of life (OR, 1.20). Among sexually active women, lower adherence rates were associated with an increased risk for inconsistent condom use (adjusted OR, 2.17). Although counseling regarding sexual behavior and adherence to treatment regimens are often addressed separately, our data highlight the importance of discussing these factors in relation to one another, particularly with regard to patients experiencing virologic failure."
13916,0.005,1.0000,"In Uganda, the prevalence of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) by HIV/AIDS patients remains high and sometimes this is blamed on patients' religious behavior.

Participants who self-identified as Pentecostal and Muslim had the highest percentage of members with high religiosity scores and ART adherence. Among Muslim participants (34), 82% reported high religiosity scores and high levels of ART adherence. Of the fifty Pentecostals participants, 96% reported high religiosity scores and 80% reported high levels of ART adherence. Correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between ART adherence and religiosity (r = 0.618, P ≤ 0.01). Therefore, collaboration between religious leaders and HIV/AIDS healthcare providers should be encouraged as one of the strategies for enhancing ART adherence."

AGAS assesses the ease and ability of participants to take antiretroviral therapy according to a health care provider's recommendations. Data were analyzed from completed baseline assessments of the two studies. The AGAS was internally consistent in both samples. Content, construct, and criterion validity were established using factor analysis and correlations of total AGAS scores with two measures of adherence: electronic drug monitoring and an Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group adherence scale. Viral load, CD4 cell counts, and depression scores were also examined. Reliability and validity of the AGAS were supported in both samples."

Adherence is influenced by many behavioural and social factors and incarceration might be one such factor. This study determined the level of adherence and reasons for non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy among 93 HIV-infected prisoners. Up to 56% of these patients had poor adherence. A similar rate of adherence was detected in prisoners after release. Problems with antiretroviral adherence among prisoners appear to be mostly linked to their deviant behaviour.

To address the burden of HIV/AIDS among this at-risk population, there is need to gain a better understanding of the factors that influence and affect their care-seeking behavior and specifically adherence to antiretroviral treatment. A preliminary qualitative study was conducted with a sample of the target population (n = 10) using grounded theory as the methodological approach. Similarly, 21 healthcare providers - physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and case managers - were then interviewed. A thematic analysis of the transcripts compared care-provider perceptions and narrated experiences with those from the patient participants. Themes related to patient care perceived to enhance medication adherence included (1) provider-patient relationship; (2) holistic and patient-centered care; (3) adequacy of patient education and counseling; (4) modeling adherence behavior; and (5) motivation. Two intervention strategies are proposed - Peer educators as an integral part of the care team and Patient Advisory Groups as a feedback mechanism to enhance effective delivery of patient care in the target population. This exploratory research lays a foundation for the design of targeted interventions to improve linkage to care and enhance medication adherence in African-American women living with HIV/AIDS."

From January to August 2009, we assessed the sexual behaviour of HIV-infected patients attending an HIV treatment centre in Uganda and analysed characteristics associated with HIV sero-discordance. Of the 278 respondents, 256 (92.1%) were female, 218 (78.1%) were on antiretroviral drugs and 107 (38.7%) belonged to a sero-discordant couple. In the prior 3 months, 238 (88.5%) had more than one sexual partner and 98 (35.8%) had acquired new sexual partners. Only 171 (61.5%) had ever disclosed sero-status to main sexual partners. Participants who had changed sexual partners in the previous 3 months were more likely to be sero-discordant (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.13, 3.11). Respondents who used condoms during their last sexual intercourse and those currently on ARVs were significantly less likely to be sero-discordant (OR 0.52 95% CI 0.28, 0.96 and OR 0.52 95% CI 0.30, 0.94, respectively). Only disclosure of sero-status was independently though inversely associated with discordance (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20, 0.64). Our findings indicate that HIV patients continue exhibiting high risk behaviour characterised by changing sexual partners, having multiple sexual partners and non-use of condoms."
11056,0.005,1.0000,"(1) BACKGROUND: There are limited data regarding human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence among hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected individuals. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to determine the prevalence of HBV and HCV infection among HIV individuals; (2) METHODS: A total of 409 patients (126 HBV+ and 283 HCV+) referred to the Brazilian Reference Laboratory for Viral Hepatitis from 2010 to 2013 donated serum samples. Anti-HIV, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs, anti-HBcIgM, anti-HBe, HBeAg, and anti-HCV antibodies were measured, and anti-HCV positive samples were tested for viral RNA and genotype; (3) RESULTS: The anti-HIV antibody prevalence was 10.31% and 4.59% among HBV+ and HCV+ patients, respectively. The HCV mean (SD) viral load was log 5.14 ± 1.64 IU/mL, and genotype I was most prevalent (163/283). Anti-HBs and anti-HBc were detected in 40% and 26% of HCV+ individuals, respectively. Among the HBV+ population, the presence of anti-HIV antibodies was associated with male gender, marital status (married), tattoo, sexual orientation, sexual practices (oral sex and anal sex), history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), history of viral hepatitis treatment, and a sexual partner with hepatitis or HIV. For the HCV+ group, the presence of anti-HIV antibodies was associated with female gender, marital status (married), anal intercourse, previous history of STDs, and number of sexual partners; (4) CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of anti-HIV antibodies was found among individuals with HBV and HCV, showing the importance of education programmes towards HIV infection among HBV- and HCV-infected individuals.

9503,0.005,1.0000,"Immunosuppression associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection impacts all components of host defense against pulmonary infection. Cells within the lung have altered immune function and are important reservoirs for HIV infection. The host immune response to infected lung cells further compromises responses to a secondary pathogenic insult. In the upper respiratory tract, mucociliary function is impaired and there are decreased levels of salivary immunoglobulin A. Host defenses in the lower respiratory tract are controlled by alveolar macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. As HIV infection progresses, lung CD4 T cells are reduced in number causing a lack of activation signals from CD4 T cells and impaired defense by macrophages. CD8 T cells, on the other hand, are increased in number and cause lymphocytic alveolitis. Specific antibody responses by B-lymphocytes are decreased and opsonization of microorganisms is impaired. These observed defects in host defense of the respiratory tract explain the susceptibility of HIV-infected persons for oropharyngeal candidiasis, bacterial pneumonia, Pneumocystis pneumonia, and other opportunistic infections.

1029,0.005,1.0000,"A 71-year-old (C1I) and 69-year-old (C2I) Japanese female contracted fulminant hepatitis B after 50 and 49 years of marriage, respectively. Both index cases exhibited high levels of anti-HBc IgM antibodies (24.2 and 31.5 S/CO, respectively), suggestive of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, although they had no discernible risk factors for HBV infection, except for chronically HBV-infected spouses with detectable HBV DNA (3.3 log copies/ml [C1S: 72-year-old] and 7.2 log copies/ml [C2S: 71-year-old]). The HBV genotype/subgenotype was identical in each couple (B/B1 or C/C2). The HBV isolates from the index cases and spouses shared a nucleotide sequence identity of 99.5% and 99.7%, respectively, over the entire genome, and these four isolates had the highest nucleotide sequence identity of only 97% to HBV isolates deposited in DNA databases. Phylogenetic trees confirmed a close relationship of the HBV isolates between C1I and C1S and between C2I and C2S, supported by a high bootstrap value of 100% within each couple, indicating the transfer of HBV infection between spouses. These four isolates shared a precore mutation of G1896A known to be associated with fulminant hepatitis B. Although the history of sexual contact within a reasonable incubation period was obscure for one stable, monogamous couple (C1I and C1S), the other couple had a monogamous sexual relationship within six months prior to disease onset. This study indicates that two elderly Japanese patients with fulminant hepatitis B acquired HBV infection via interspousal (most likely sexual) transmission during long-lasting marriages."
6855,0.005,1.0000,"Viral hepatitis constitutes a major health issue, with high prevalence among injecting drug users (IDUs). The present study assessed the prevalence and risk determinants for hepatitis B, C and D viruses (HBV, HCV and HDV) infections among 102 IDUs from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Serological markers and HCV-RNA were detected by enzyme immunoassay and nested PCR, respectively. HCV genotyping was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP). HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HBs were found in 7.8, 55.8 and 24. 7% of IDUs, respectively. In the final logistic regression, HBV infection was independently associated with male homosexual intercourse within the last 5 years (odds ratio (OR) 3.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-8.8). No subject presented anti-delta (anti-HD). Anti-HCV was detected in 69.6% of subjects, and was found to be independently associated with needle sharing in the last 6 months (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.3-9.2) and with longer duration of iv drug use (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.1-8.7). These data demonstrate that this population is at high risk for both HBV and HCV infection. Among IDUs from Rio de Janeiro, unprotected sexual intercourse seems to be more closely associated with HBV infection, whereas HCV is positively correlated with high risk injecting behavior. Comprehensive public health interventions targeting this population and their sexual partners must be encouraged."
512,0.005,1.0000,"This study was designed to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in veterans. Anti-HCV testing was performed in 1,032 patients and a questionnaire regarding sociodemographic characteristics and potential risk factors was administered. Adjusted prevalence of unique HCV-positive patients using outpatient services was 17.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.2%, 18.2%). The following risk factors were associated with HCV infection: a history of injection drug use (IDU), receipt of blood transfusion prior to 1992, history of tattoo (odds ratio [OR], 2.93; 95% CI, 1.70-5.08), combat job as a medical worker (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.25-5.60), history of incarceration over 48 hours (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.52-4.32), greater than 15 lifetime sexual partners (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.94-2.76) and sexual relations with a prostitute (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.82). We concluded that HCV is common in veterans. Risk factors independently associated with infection are IDU, prior transfusion, prior tattoo, combat medical work, incarceration, and multiple opposite sex partners. Infection with HCV among veterans is strongly associated with traditional risk factors for infection and less strongly associated with combat-related risk."
19420,0.005,1.0000,"To define the epidemiology of HIV-2 infection, we conducted a case-control study among hospitalized patients at an acute care hospital in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau, a country with endemic HIV-2 infection. Among 128 patients with various diagnoses, 23 (18%) were positive for HIV-2 by ELISA and Western blot. One of these patients was serologically reactive for HIV-1 also, but PCR and viral culture revealed the presence of HIV-2 only. To study risk factors, behaviors, and AIDS knowledge related to the acquisition of HIV infection, 22 HIV-2-seropositive and 21 seronegative hospitalized patients were given a physical examination and administered a questionnaire. Among women, transfusion was associated with HIV-2 infection (OR = 14.4, p = 0.02); among men, sex with a prostitute was the principal risk factor (OR = undefined, p = 0.02). Although 79% of HIV-infected patients and controls had heard of AIDS, only 17% of all study participants and 50% of males reporting sex with prostitutes had used condoms in the previous year. These data suggest that the risk factors for HIV-2 infection are similar to those for HIV-1 and support previous studies showing that HIV-2 is the predominant HIV in Guinea-Bissau. Efforts to decrease transmission of HIV-2 should include screening for HIV-2 in blood for transfusion in endemic areas (now done in Bissau) and education about the risk of sexual transmission."
18039,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-HIV coinfection currently occurs in more than 30% of HIV-positive patients in Spain. Nowadays, the treatment of choice for chronic hepatitis due to HCV infection in HIV-positive patients is pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. This combination achieves an overall cure rate of 50%, which is somewhat lower than those obtained in patients with HCV monoinfection. Adverse effects are frequent, leading to treatment withdrawal in 10-20% of patients. Importantly, there are three new features of hepatitis C in patients with HIV: (1) the recent development of epidemic outbreaks of acute hepatitis due to HCV infection in HIV-positive men caused by homosexual activity, (2) pharmacogenetic markers in the form of genetic polymorphisms near the IL28B gene related to response to HCV treatment as well as spontaneous eradication of HCV after acute infection, and (3) new antiviral molecules have allowed triple combination treatments to be designed and the preliminary results of clinical trials reporting high response rates are highly promising."
14418,0.005,1.0000,"The paradigm of AIDS patient care has evolved to that of a chronic disease that is manageable with combination antiretroviral therapy. Intermittent adherence to antiretroviral regimens, however, has been associated with the selection of HIV mutations, resulting in drug-resistant virus. Medication compliance has become a vital component in the care of HIV-infected patients. This study was designed to assess the degree of medication compliance with zidovudine (ZDV) over a 2-month period among a convenience sample of 23 ambulatory patients with HIV infection. Enrollment took place during February to March 1995, when monotherapy with ZDV was considered the standard of care. Medication compliance was assessed by three methods: patient self-report determined by questionnaire, pharmacy refill records from the 3 months immediately before entry in the study, and an electronic monitoring system (Medication Event Management Systems [MEMS], Aprex Corp., Fremont, CA), which records the date and time of each opening of the medication vials. MEMS was utilized among a subgroup of eight participants over a 2-month period. Despite greater than 95% (22 of 23) of the subjects reporting that they believed ZDV was life prolonging, a majority took < or = 75% of the prescribed doses of ZDV as identified by both refill and MEMS methods. The mean percentage compliance over a 2-month period of observation for MEMS and pharmacy refill record review methods was 66% and 78%, respectively (p = 0.294). Among the subgroup of eight in the MEMS evaluation, 88% reported taking their ZDV according to the directions, all of the time. These results demonstrate that reliance upon patient self-report of medication compliance is less accurate than MEMS or pharmacy refill records, and that reliance on self-reporting could lead to erroneous assumptions of the patient's true drug compliance. In addition, the study suggests that pharmacy refill records may provide a method of assessing compliance that is equivalent to MEMS but is less experimental, and can easily be followed and interpreted by pharmacists and other clinicians caring for patients infected with HIV. Most importantly, relatively poor compliance rates demonstrated by MEMS raises serious concern for widespread development of HIV resistance to the more complicated, multiple-drug regimens in present use."
17989,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment of HIV infection with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) requires high levels of adherence in order to obtain maximum benefit and minimize the development of antiviral resistance. Many patients in community clinical settings have imperfect adherence that may lead to poor clinical outcomes. The Connecticut HIV Medication Project (CHaMP) is a multidisciplinary program designed to evaluate patients receiving antiviral therapy. Based on results of a multifaceted assessment, a variety of targeted interventions and follow-up are offered. A retrospective analysis was performed on patients who were referred to the program over a 35-month period from March 2002 through January 2005. Two hundred forty-nine patients who were referred for adherence services had baseline and follow-up data available for analysis. Participants who maintained an unchanged antiretroviral regimen experienced a significant increase in self-reported adherence (89.1% to 96.9%, p < 0.001) and likelihood of reporting more than 95% adherence (36.6% to 73.1%, p < 0.001) by 7-day recall. Improvements in plasma HIV viremia (3.10 +/- 1.21 log copies to 2.78 +/- 0.98, p < 0.01) were also demonstrated. Limitations to this study included the unusually high level of baseline adherence, the large fraction of patients (28.6%) who were lost to follow-up, and follow-up that was limited to one time point at 12-16 weeks such that attrition of the intervention effect could not be assessed. The CHaMP experience demonstrates that the development of a multifaceted clinical program can have significant impact on medication adherence and viral burden in HIV infection."
8214,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality (1). Transmission of HCV is primarily via parenteral blood exposure, and HCV can be transmitted vertically from mother to child. Vertical transmission occurs in 5.8% (95% confidence interval = 4.2%-7.8%) of infants born to women who are infected only with HCV and in up to twice as many infants born to women who are also infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (2) or who have high HCV viral loads (3,4); there is currently no recommended intervention to prevent transmission of infection from mother to child (3). Increased reported incidence of HCV infection among persons aged ≤30 years (5,6) with similar increases among women and men in this age group (6), raises concern about increases in the number of pregnant women with HCV infection, and in the number of infants who could be exposed to HCV at birth. Data from one large commercial laboratory and birth certificate data were used to investigate trends in HCV detection among women of childbearing age,* HCV testing among children aged ≤2 years, and the proportions of infants born to HCV-infected women nationally and in Kentucky, the state with the highest incidence of acute HCV infection during 2011-2014 (6). During 2011-2014, commercial laboratory data indicated that national rates of HCV detection (antibody or RNA positivity(†)) among women of childbearing age increased 22%, and HCV testing (antibody or RNA) among children aged ≤2 years increased 14%; birth certificate data indicated that the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected mothers increased 68%, from 0.19% to 0.32%. During the same time in Kentucky, the HCV detection rate among women of childbearing age increased >200%, HCV testing among children aged ≤2 years increased 151%, and the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected women increased 124%, from 0.71% to 1.59%. Increases in the rate of HCV detection among women of childbearing age suggest a potential risk for vertical transmission of HCV. These findings highlight the importance of following current CDC recommendations to identify, counsel, and test persons at risk for HCV infection (1,7), including pregnant women, as well as consider developing public health policies for routine HCV testing of pregnant women, and expanding current policies for testing and monitoring children born to HCV-infected women. Expansion of HCV reporting and surveillance requirements will enhance case identification and prevention strategies. "
6530,0.005,1.0000,"Different forms of motor neuron disease occurring in association with HIV infection have been described. We present two patients with pseudobulbar syndrome and HIV infection, with no clinical or electromyographic signs of lower motor neuron loss. In patient 1, on follow-up, focal seizures led to additional investigations that identified unsuspected HIV infection and progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML). In patient 2, all investigations excluded an active HIV infection or central nervous system involvement, and the disease progression made primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) with pseudobulbar onset the most likely diagnosis. ALS-like syndrome can occur in association with HIV infection; however, the causal relationship remains uncertain. Patient 1 shows that PML is a possible cause for pseudobulbar syndrome, and our second patient demonstrates that ALS may also occur by chance in patients with HIV infection."

To evaluate gender equity in ART access among adults (defined for this report as persons aged ≥15 years), 765,087 adult ART patient medical records from 12 countries in five geographic regions* were analyzed to estimate the ratio of women to men among new ART enrollees for each calendar year during 2002-2013. This annual ratio was compared with estimates from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)(†) of the ratio of HIV-infected adult women to men in the general population. In all 10 African countries and Haiti, the most recent estimates of the ratio of adult women to men among new ART enrollees significantly exceeded the UNAIDS estimates for the female-to-male ratio among HIV-infected adults by 23%-83%. In six African countries and Haiti, the ratio of women to men among new adult ART enrollees increased more sharply over time than the estimated UNAIDS female-to-male ratio among adults with HIV in the general population. Increased ART coverage among men is needed to decrease their morbidity and mortality and to reduce HIV incidence among their sexual partners. Reaching more men with HIV testing and linkage-to-care services and adoption of test-and-treat ART eligibility guidelines (i.e., regular testing of adults, and offering treatment to all infected persons with ART, regardless of CD4 cell test results) could reduce gender inequity in ART coverage.

19268,0.005,1.0000,"There are significant differences in clinical characteristics between chronic hepatitis B virus infected (CHB) child and adult patients. Viral quasispecies characteristics are associated with its pathogenic properties. For hepatitis B virus (HBV), its core region is the main immune recognition region for its enriched epitopes. In our study, we discuss the quasispecies characteristics and positive selection within core gene within chronic HBV infected child and adult patients. By analyzing 170 core gene sequences from child CHB patients and 121 core genes sequences from adult CHB patients, quasispecies characteristics were described by sequence complexity, diversity, non-synonymous substitution ratio (dN) and synonymous substitution ratios (dS). In addition, positive selection sites were also determined by bioinformatics tools. Then, all these parameters were compared between child and adult CHB patient groups. Compared with child patients, adult patients with CHB showed distinct quasispecies characteristics within the core region, had a higher sequence complexity and diversity and more positive selection sites, suggesting that the adult CHB patients had a higher immune selection pressure on the HBV core gene. Reduced selection pressure on the HBV core gene in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB patients than HBeAg negative CHB patients were observed in both adult and child patient groups. The majority of the screened positive selection sites lay within human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-restricted epitopes. In conclusion, this study analyzed the quasispecies characteristics discrepancy between child and adult patients with CHB, and revealed the possible reason for the distinct clinical characteristics in the perspective of population genetics."

1573,0.005,1.0000,"Human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV1) is a lymphotropic virus which can be transmitted through unprotected sexual activity, breast feeding, and blood transfusion. Although most of HTLV1-infected individuals remain asymptomatic carriers, 1% to 5% and 3% to 5% develop adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, respectively. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HTLV1 infection in hemodialysis patients in Sari and Ghaemshahr. This cross-sectional study was conducted on160 patients using random samples selection, and included 80 men and 80 women (mean age, 59.1 &plusmn; 14.7 years). All the samples were screened for HTLV1 antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and positive samples were confirmed by Western blot assay. Only 1 patient had a positive anti-HTLV1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, which was confirmed by Western blot. The overall prevalence of HTLV1 seropositivity was 0.6%. The patient was a 21-year-old woman with a history of multiple blood transfusions. She had a history of unsuccessful kidney transplantation and had been on hemodialysis before transplant, too. This study suggests that HTLV1 infection may not be prevalent in high-risk patients in Mazandaran province, and there is no need for HTLV1 screening of blood samples."

Seventy-seven HIV-1-positive patients were asked to answer the validated questionnaire of the European preliminary criteria for the classification of Sjögren's syndrome on oral and ocular sicca symptoms. Twenty-six patients gave one positive answer to both ocular and oral symptoms, and of these 14 (hepatitis C virus negative) consented to participate in the study (patients group). Ten age- and sex-matched HIV-1-positive patients with a negative questionnaire constituted the control group. Patients and controls had: (a) Schirmer's test and slit-lamp examination after Rose Bengal staining; (b) parotid gland scanning with technetium; (c) detection of autoantibodies in sera to Ro/SSA and La/SSB; (d) labial salivary gland biopsy (patients group only). The control group gave negative parotid gland scanning and only one gave a positive Rose Bengal staining test. In the patients group, parotid gland enlargement was manifested by three patients and only one gave positive Rose Bengal staining test. Six out of the 14 patients had biopsies identical with Sjögren's syndrome and five of these gave positive parotid gland scanning. In the biopsies of four other patients, mucoid degeneration of the stroma was found. Immunopathology revealed that the predominant cells were T cells with the CD8 phenotype. None of the patient and control sera had autoantibodies to Ro/SSA and La/SSB, whereas all patients had hypergammaglobulinaemia. The overall prevalence of possible SLS in a mixed population of HIV(+) patients (88.3% men and 11.7% women) was 7.79% which is >2.5 times higher than that observed in normal Greek adult females."

However, this decrease was less marked in asymptomatic patients; in fact, the percentage and number of the above cells in this group of subjects was significantly higher than in the AIDS patients (Student's t-test, p < 0.05). However, we failed to find significant differences in the percentage of natural killer cells (NKCs; CD15 ( + ) CD56 ( + ) ) between the HIV-1-infected asymptomatic or AIDS groups of patients, or when compared with the controls (mean +/- SD of 10.4% +/- 9.4%, 14.3% +/- 9.7%, and 14.8% +/- 6.4%, respectively). Whereas either group of patients had a lower number of NKCs per microliter than the control group (mean +/- SD of 137.8 +/- 87.6, 91.1 +/- 98.3, and 331. 5 +/- 266.5, respectively), this decrease only reached statistical significance for the AIDS patients (Student's t-test, p < 0.05). Healthy controls showed statistically significantly higher NKC activity than either the HIV-1-infected asymptomatic or AIDS group of patients (K-562 target cell; mean +/- SD and range values as percentage of specific lysis of 19.1% +/- 15.6% and 2.4%-58.2%, 3.4% +/- 3.2% and less than 0.1% [non-detectable]-10.3%, and 6.4% +/- 5. 5% and less than 0.1%-19.5%, respectively; Student's t-test, p < 0. 05). Challenge of samples from the control group with either interleukin-2, alpha-interferon, or with a mixture of the calcium ionophore A23187 (Io) plus the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ester (TPA) resulted in every case in a statistically significant increase in NKC lytic function (mean +/- SD and range values as percentage of specific lysis of 19.1% +/- 15.6% and 2.4%-58.2%, 27. 6% +/- 17.4% and less than 0.1%-56.0%, 32.1% +/- 20.9% and 2.1%-76. 4%, and 62.6% +/- 24.0% and 16.7%-95.0%, respectively; Student's t-test, p < 0.05). A similar challenge for samples from the HIV-1-positive subjects, either asymptomatic or with AIDS, resulted in most cases in an enhanced NKC activity; however, this increase in NKC lytic function reached statistical significance only for the group of Io + TPA-incubated samples (Student's t-test, p < 0.05). These results indicate that control or patient baseline NKC activity, and the response of this cellular immune function to a challenge with different immunomodulators, are phenotype-independent. They also suggest an association between HIV-1 infection and alterations in the initial mechanisms responsible for NKC activation; a similar general explanation has been suggested to account for the abnormal NKC lytic function observed in various severe pathological conditions, e.g., extensive burns, polytrauma, and sepsis. Understanding the molecular mechanism involved in regulating initial NKC activation could provide the rational basis for the design of newer pharmacological strategies to treat these conditions."

10486,0.005,1.0000,"An alarmingly high prevalence of childhood sexual and physical abuse has been observed in HIV-infected men and women, with rates several times higher than observed in the general population. Childhood abuse history has been associated with worse antiretroviral adherence and negative health behaviours in HIV-infected patients. This study evaluates the relationship between childhood abuse and the timing of presentation for HIV care. Participants in a multi-center prospective cohort study, who established initial HIV care after January 1996 and had a CD4 count available within six months of initial presentation, were included in this analysis. Bivariate contingency tables and multivariate logistic regression were used to evaluate the association of childhood abuse with early presentation for HIV care (initial CD4 count > or =200/mm3). Among the 186 subjects included in this analysis, 33% had childhood abuse histories and 58% had an initial CD4 count > or =200/mm3. Participants with a history of childhood abuse were more likely to present early for HIV care (AOR=2.12; p=0.03), perhaps because survivors of abuse tend to have higher utilization of health services. Because HIV-infected patients with childhood abuse histories have worse antiretroviral medication adherence and are more likely to engage in high-risk sexual and injection drug use behaviours, early presentation affords clinicians the opportunity for timely institution of interventions that may improve patient outcomes and prevent secondary HIV infections."

Significantly higher frequencies (p less than 0.05) of simple phobia and hypoactive sexual desire disorder were noted with knowledge of HIV seropositivity. Disorders that occurred more commonly than in age-matched Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) participants included: simple phobia, antisocial personality disorder, alcohol abuse, and organic mental disorders. The high prevalence of major psychiatric illness in this sample supports the notion that screening for psychiatric illness, and counseling where indicated, should be integral to HIV screening programs."

Eight children were referred for evaluation because of maternal HIV-1 infection. The risk factors for HIV-1 infection included maternal/perinatal exposure (22), perinatal blood transfusion (6), blood transfusion during infancy (2), and sexual abuse (2). Ten (31%) of the 32 children have subsequently died. The longest survival from perinatal infection was 12 years. HIV-1 infection in children can result in a prolonged clinical latency and can masquerade as other pathologic conditions.

Overall prevalence was anti-HIV, 0.34%; anti-HBc, 11.1%; HBsAg, 2.4%; anti-HCV, 6.4%; HTLV, 1.09%; and syphilis, 3.4%. The majority (86.3%) reported a history of sexual activity; 27% had never used condoms. Girls also reported previous pregnancy (35%), abortion (26%) and sexual abuse (74%). Many youth reported a family history of alcohol abuse (56%), illicit drug use (24.7%), or legal problems (38%). Serological results show that youth in Salvador are at high risk for blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections. Policies to reduce the risk and impact of these infections should be a requisite part of health care for incarcerated youth."
15415,0.005,1.0000,"Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head is an emerging complication in HIV infected patients. It has been suggested that the increased incidence of AVN in this population may be caused by an increased prevalence of predisposing factors for osteonecrosis, including protease inhibitors, hyperlipidemia, corticosteroid use, alcohol and intravenous drug abuse. The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors for avascular necrosis developing in the femoral head of HIV infected individuals. This study consisted of meta-analysis of the secondary data extracted from current literature. The selected articles allowed two study groups to be drawn up for comparison. Group 1 comprised 324 individuals infected by the HIV virus, who did not present femoral head AVN. Group 2 comprised 32 HIV positive patients, who presented femoral head AVN. The parameters used for analysis were as follows: age, gender, sexual preference, use of intravenous drugs, time of diagnosis, CD4+ cell count, use of antiretroviral agents and duration, serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides. The present study found a statistically significant association between hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, sexual preference and intravenous drug abuse. The authors concluded that femoral head osteonecrosis is associated with hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia) and intravenous drug abuse. This study supports the hypothesis that protease inhibitors play a role in the development of osteonecrosis through a tendency to cause hyperlipidemia."

This study attempts to clarify the link between the pattern of drug abuse and seroprevalence for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among volunteers attending a detoxification clinic in Jerusalem. Three hundred heroin abusers were interviewed about their drug habits and sexual preference. In addition, all participants underwent HIV serological testing. The majority of them took heroin by smoking, with only 19% injecting the drug. None of the participants in the study were HIV seropositive. An association is seen between the pattern of illicit drug use in Israel and the low incidence of AIDS in this country."
16379,0.005,1.0000,"In general, little is known about the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) among drug users, especially among non-injecting drug users. Therefore, changes in incidence, risk factors, and circulating genotypes over time were determined among drug users in Amsterdam over an 18-year period (1985-2002). Sera of 1,268 drug users, both injecting and non-injecting, were screened for anti-HBc. HBV genotypes of the anti-HBc seroconverters were determined. Poisson regression was used to test for temporal trends in incidence and to identify risk factors for seroconversion. Of the 598 participants who were anti-HBc negative at entry, 83 seroconverted for anti-HBc. The incidence of HBV declined from 5.9/100 Person Years up to 1993 to 0/100 Person Years in 2002. Of the drug users infected acutely, both injecting and non-injecting, 88% were infected with the same genotype D, serotype ayw3 strain. Multivariate analyses revealed current injecting, age, and calendar year of visit as independent risk factors. The decline in the incidence of HBV among drug users in Amsterdam is probably caused by a decline in injecting behavior. Injecting and non-injecting drug users were infected with the same strain, indicating that drug users infect one another, regardless of their risk behavior. After 2000, no injecting drug users with an acute HBV infection were reported to the Public Health Service Amsterdam and the specific genotype D strain had disappeared. These findings suggest that drug users may no longer be a high-risk group for HBV infection in Amsterdam. However, trends in drug use need to be monitored."

However, differences between new and longer-term injecting drug users (IDUs) have not received as much attention. This study examined injecting initiation experience, risk and risk reduction practices, and self-reported HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing practices and infection among new (injecting < or =4 years) and longer-term IDUs. Data from 3 cross-sectional surveys in 1992, 1994, and 1997 of syringe exchange program (SEP) users in Oslo, Norway, were used. Approximately one fifth of IDUs were new injectors. New IDUs were increasingly indistinguishable from longer-term IDUs in terms of socio-demographics, risk practices, and HIV and HCV testing. The prevalence of HIV infection remained low (5%); in contrast, approximately two thirds of all SEP users reported being HCV-infected. Known HCV infection status had no impact on syringe sharing; most HCV-infected SEP users reported sharing syringes, regardless of the duration of injecting. The only variable associated with HCV infection was injecting < or =4 years (adjusted odds ratio = 0.2; 95% confidence interval = 0.1-0.4). Increased similarity in age between new and longer-term IDUs may have contributed to the rapid spread of HCV infection by facilitating mixing patterns between HCV-infected and -susceptible IDUs."

The goal of our study was to assess HIV infection, risk perceptions and injecting equipment sharing among IDUs in Budapest, Hungary. Altogether 150 IDUs were interviewed (121 structured interviews between 1999 and 2000 and 29 ethnographic interviews between 2003 and 2004). The majority of them injected heroin (52% and 79%) and many injected amphetamines (51% and 35%). One person tested positive for HIV. Two thirds (68%) shared injecting equipment (syringes, cookers and filters). Some participants said they shared syringes because they were not carrying them for fear of police harassment and that they reused filters as a backup drug supply. In multivariate analysis, sharing of injecting equipment was associated with higher perceived susceptibility to HIV/AIDS, lower self-efficacy for sterile equipment use, higher motivation to comply with peer pressure to use dirty injecting equipment and with having a criminal record. The high levels of injecting risk-behaviors found in this study are a cause for serious concern. Interventions for HIV-prevention need to address not only sharing syringes but also sharing and reusing of other injecting equipment and drug filters."

Nineteen patients were studied: 7 had a previous HBeAg-positive phase and had spontaneous or therapeutically induced loss of HBeAg (group A); 12 had no previous HBeAg-positive phase (group B). Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed on serum collected during the anti-HBe-positive phase in the two groups. In group A, precore sequencing showed that 5 patients were infected by wild-type virus, 1 patient was infected with a precore mutant, and 1 patient was found to be infected by a mixture of wild-type and precore mutant viruses. In group B, precore sequencing showed that only 1 patient was infected with wild-type virus and that 11 were infected with precore mutants. In a few patients, the presence of HBeAg within immune complexes may explain HBeAg negativity. In conclusion, our results show that, in patients with anti-HBe-positive chronic hepatitis B: (1) precore mutations creating a stop codon are more frequently found in those without known previous HBeAg positivity; (2) after loss of HBeAg, the patients who have anti-HBe-positive reactivation are infected by wild-type virus, which suggests that reactivation is not related to precore mutations; (3) HBeAg negativity may be caused by immune complexes formation."
17053,0.005,1.0000,"The present study determined lifetime and current psychiatric functioning in a sample of homosexual or bisexual men at various stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in order to address several questions regarding the relationship between psychopathology and HIV infection. HIV+ asymptomatic or symptomatic and HIV- homosexual or bisexual men completed self-report measures of psychological and health functioning and participated in structured diagnostic interviews. Additional information regarding HIV-related life events and their potential relationship to onset of disorder and family history of psychiatric disorder were obtained. A high lifetime prevalence of affective and substance use disorder was found, with almost one half of the sample meeting criteria for both disorders. Lifetime affective disorder diagnosis was associated with a positive family history of affective disorder. HIV-related events were most closely associated with onset or recurrence of affective disorder compared with other disorders. Low current rates of psychiatric disorder and levels of emotional distress were found, with no differences in degree of psychiatric adjustment across stage of infection. We conclude that the lifetime prevalence of certain categories of psychiatric disorder is high in both HIV+ and HIV- homosexual samples. Increased rates of psychiatric disorders do not appear to be a consequence of HIV infection. However, episodes of illness, particularly affective disorder, may develop following an HIV-related event such as confirmation of infection. Although symptomatic subjects have more somatic difficulties, there appears to be no relationship between stage of illness and level of emotional distress."
15618,0.005,1.0000,"AIDS cases attributable to heterosexual vaginal intercourse constitute a growing proportion of new AIDS cases in the United States. Major cofactors that possibly increase the efficiency of heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 include genital ulcer disease, multiple sexual exposures, lack of male circumcision, and primary and advanced stages of HIV-1 disease. I report the case of a 33-year-old woman who was recently infected with HIV-1 after one to three nontraumatic episodes of vaginal intercourse with a healthy-appearing, HIV-1-infected, bisexual man. An investigation of her exposure history revealed the precise time frame during which infection occurred. The patient developed a primary HIV-1-infection syndrome and became seropositive for HIV-1 within eight weeks of her last sexual contact with the infected man. An epidemiological and laboratory evaluation of the index patient and her sexual partner identified only one risk factor for enhanced HIV-1 transmission: the patient's use of oral contraceptives. Her partner was immunologically intact, HIV-1 antigen negative, and circumcised. Both of the individuals were from Minnesota, as were their recent sexual partners. This case illustrates that HIV-1 infection by vaginal intercourse can occur in the absence of the major risk factors believed to increase the efficiency of transmission. Even in a low HIV-1 prevalence area like Minnesota, efforts to promote awareness of HIV-1 status, abstinence, non-penetrative sex, or barrier protection need to be expanded and the behaviors adopted by sexually active persons if HIV-1 transmission is to be minimized."

The patients were interviewed extensively for potential risk factors associated with transmission. Of the 203 patients with type B hepatitis, 34 (30 men, 4 women) showed serologic evidence of acute HDV infection (HDV+ group), while the other 169 did not (HDV- group). Of the 30 HDV+ men, 27 (90%) had had sexual intercourse with prostitutes within 3 months of admission, while only 31 (22.7%) of the 136 HDV- men, 8 (17.4%) of the 46 men with non-A, non-B hepatitis and 5 (8.3%) of the 60 control men had done so (P less than .001). Of the 4 HDV+ women, 1 was a prostitute and another was the wife of a patient with active HDV infection. There was no significant difference in exposure to other risk factors among these groups of patients. The results suggest that heterosexual exposure, particularly prostitute contact, is the most important route of HDV transmission in the general population of this area endemic for HBV infection."

Laboratory results were recorded. Clinical gynecologic examination was performed including Pap smear. The patients were assigned into two groups, HPV and non-HPV group. The comparison of the potential risk factors between the groups was calculated statistically. It was found that the prevalence of HPV infection was reported in 17 patients (9.6%). HIV-seropositive women, who were infected with HPV, had a significantly more probability to have a single partner in their lifetime than those who were not infected. It could be that HPV cervical infection and HIV-seropositive women share common potential risk factors, as well as, the recognition of sexual intercourse as the important route of HPV transmission."

To accomplish this, a direct three-color monoclonal antibody labeling technique was employed to identify immune cells in fresh ejaculates. Once labeled, the percent of each immune subset present in the ejaculate was determined by flow cytometric analysis. The percent of CD3+ cells present in the semen of the HIV+ group showed no significant difference when compared with semen from the HIV- group. Analysis of the CD4+ subset yielded a significantly lower percent in the HIV+ group than in the HIV- group. The analysis of the CD8+ subset yielded a higher percent of cells present in semen from HIV+ individuals. The CD8 higher value along with lower CD4 value results in a lower CD4/CD8 ratio in the HIV+ group. Further subset studies showed that the percent of cells expressing naive (CD4+ CD45RA+) and memory (CD4+ CD45RO+) markers was lower in the HIV+ group. This study provides additional data supporting the utility of flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies to immunophenotypic cells present in semen ejaculates. It is also the first reported application of the technique to a disease-based model and may be useful to better understand issues of mucosal immunity and transmission of sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV."
16513,0.005,1.0000,"Co-infection with either HIV or HBV in chronic hepatitis C patients is common, since all these viruses share transmission routes and geographical distribution. Interaction between these viruses generally amplifies liver damage, increasing the risk of developing end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. HIV-HCV co-infection is associated with poorer response to antiviral therapy. New antivirals against HCV are eagerly awaited for this population. HBV-HCV dual infections are less common. The principles guiding indication of therapy in monoinfected patients should be followed considering which virus replicates in persons with serological markers of dual HBV-HCV infection. Although there is growing evidence supporting the use of direct acting antivirals (DAA) in dually infected patients with active HCV replication, prospective trials should be conducted to demonstrate their benefit, assessing carefully the rate and clinical consequences of HBV rebounds."
7349,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a human pathogen associated with chronic liver disease. Recently, the cell culture systems supporting complete replication and production of HCV genotype 2a (JFH1) have been established. This study investigated the effect of low-speed centrifugation on HCV JFH1 infection of human hepatocytes (Huh7.5.1). Higher levels of HCV RNA expression were observed in Huh7.5.1 cells infected with centrifugal inoculation of HCV JFH1 than those in the control cells. This increased HCV RNA expression was associated with the elevated expression of HCV NS3 protein in the hepatocytes. The centrifugal enhancement of HCV infection was time and speed dependent. However, the enhancement was not observed when centrifugation was performed before or after HCV infection. In addition, there was no association between centrifugal enhancement and the expression of HCV entry receptors (CD81 and claudin-1) and intracellular IFN-alpha in the hepatocytes. These data indicate that centrifugal inoculation is a useful tool for increasing the efficiency of HCV infection and replication in the target cells in vitro."
16799,0.005,1.0000,"Viral diversity is an important predictor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment response and may influence viral pathogenesis. HIV influences HCV variability in the plasma; however, limited data on viral variability are available from distinct tissue/cell compartments in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Thus, this exploratory study evaluated diversity of the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of HCV in the plasma and liver for 14 patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Median intra-patient genetic distances and entropy values were similar in the plasma and liver compartments. Positive immune selection pressure was observed in the plasma for five individuals and in the liver for three individuals. Statistical evidence supporting viral compartmentalization was found in five individuals. Linear regression identified ALT (P = 0.0104) and AST (P = 0.0130) as predictors of viral compartmentalization. A total of 12 signature amino acids that distinguish liver from plasma E1/HVR1 were identified. One signature amino acid was shared by at least two individuals. These findings suggest that HCV compartmentalization is relatively common among patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. These data also imply that evaluating viral diversity, including drug resistance patterns, in the serum/plasma only may not adequately represent viruses replicating with in the liver and, thus, deserves careful consideration in future studies."

This study investigates the impact of HCV in HIV coinfected patients with undetectable viraemia under HAART on the levels of peripheral T cell's immune-activation. We determined T lymphocytes subsets to characterize immune-activation defined as CD38 and/or HLA-DR expression in chronic monoinfected HCV, HIV, and HIV/HCV coinfected subjects. One hundred and fifty six patients were divided into three groups: (i) 77 HIV+ patients; (ii) 50 HCV+ patients; and (iii) 29 coinfected HIV/HCV patients. The level of CD4(+) was significantly higher in HCV+ than in HIV+ or in coinfected HIV/HCV subjects. The frequencies of CD4(+) CD38(+) /HLA-DR(-) , CD4(+) CD38(-) /HLA-DR(+) and CD4(+) CD38(+) /HLA-DR(+) in HIV+ patients were comparable to those measured in coinfected patients, but statistically higher than those observed in HCV+ subjects. The percentage of CD8(+) was comparable in HIV-1+ patients and coinfected HIV/HCV but the results obtained in both groups were significantly higher compared to the results obtained in HCV patients. The level of CD8(+) CD38(+) /HLA-DR(-) showed values lower in HIV+ patients than in that monoinfected HCV and coinfected HIV/HCV patients. The frequencies of CD8(+) CD38(-) /HLA-DR(+) were higher in HIV+ patients compared to HCV+ and coinfected HIV/HCV patients. HIV/HCV coinfected group showed highest levels of CD8(+) CD38(+) /HLA-DR(+) . HIV plays a pivotal role to determine the immune activation in the host. The role of HCV needs of further investigations but our data show that HCV mainly influences the immune-activation of the pool of CD8, but also probably plays a supporting additive effect on CD4 immune-activation.

7461,0.005,1.0000,"The influence of immunodeficiency on the course of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is still debated, although a worsening effect has been suggested. We compared the characteristics of hepatitis C in two groups of hematologic patients with different levels of immunocompetence who acquired the same virus strain after treatment with contaminated intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). Indications for IVIG therapy were idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in six patients and hypogammaglobulinemia in 7 patients with various hematologic disorders, who were defined immunodeficient (ID). Infection rate was 100%. Five ID patients never developed HCV antibodies despite serum HCV-RNA positivity. The same HCV genotype was shown in 10 patients tested. Moreover, E1-E2 gene partial nucleotide sequencing, performed in four patients, showed identical or closely related amino acid sequences, thus strongly supporting the hypothesis of a common source of infection. Clinical acute infection did not differ significantly between the two groups, but subsequent liver failure developed in five of the seven ID patients and in none of the ITP patients (P = .04). Liver biopsy, performed in three cases, documented HCV as the only cause of liver damage. Six ID patients died, with liver disease being the primary cause of death in four cases and a contributory cause in two cases. Their median survival after IVIG was 12 months, significantly worse than that of ITP patients (P = .0028). We conclude that immunodeficiency markedly worsens the course of IVIG-acquired HCV infection in hematologic patients."

In this study, the safety, tolerability, antiviral activity and pharmacokinetics (PK) of GS-9857 were evaluated in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-4 infection. Patients with genotype 1-4 infection received placebo or once-daily GS-9857 at doses ranging from 50 to 300 mg for 3 days under fasting conditions. GS-9857 was well tolerated; all reported adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate in severity. Diarrhoea and headache were the most commonly reported AEs. Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were observed in 17% of patients receiving GS-9857; there were no Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase levels. GS-9857 demonstrated potent antiviral activity in patients with chronic HCV infection, achieving mean and median maximum reductions in HCV RNA of ≥3 log10 IU/mL following administration of a 100-mg dose in patients with HCV genotype 1a, 1b, 2, 3 or 4 infection. The antiviral activity of GS-9857 was unaffected by the presence of pretreatment NS3 RAVs. In patients with genotype 1-4 infection, GS-9857 exhibited linear PK and was associated with a median half-life of 29-42 h, supporting once-daily dosing.

In this study, the prevalence of HGV-RNA and antibodies to E2 envelope antigen (anti-E2) which is a marker of past infection, have been investigated in the samples of patients with HCV and HBV infections, and the prevalence rates were compared with the control group. The study group consisted of 50 patients with HBV and 50 patients with HCV infections, who did not have any risk for parenteral transmission, and 60 healthy control subjects. Serum samples were tested for the presence of HGV-RNA by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for anti-E2 by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As a result, HGV-RNA and anti-HGV-E2 positivity rates in HBV and HCV infected patients were found as; 4% and 6%, 4% and 4%, respectively. Although the prevalence of HGV-RNA in patients with HBV and HCV infections were higher than the control group (1.66%), there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05). The prevalence of anti-E2 antibodies in patients with HBV and HCV infections did not revealed any difference in comparison to the control group (6.66%) (p>0.05). In conclusion, GBV-C/HGV infection prevalence was found low in patients with HBV and HCV infections, supporting that although parenteral route is the most effective way, other routes such as sexual contact and intra-familial contact may also play role in HGV transmission."

The impact of baseline V3 characteristics on treatment response was evaluated in a randomised, double blind, prospective cohort study with patients initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy with lopinavir or efavirenz plus azithothymidine/3TC (1:1) over 48 weeks. Similar virological and immunological responses were observed for both treatment regimens. The 43 individuals had a mean baseline CD4 T cell count of 119 cells/mm(3) [standard deviation (SD) = 99] and a mean viral load of 5.09 log(10) copies/mL (SD = 0.49). The GWGR motif was not associated with a CD4 T cell response, but predicted R5 tropism by the geno2pheno([clinical20%]) algorithm correlated with higher CD4 T cell levels at all monitoring points (p < 0.05). Moreover, higher false-positive rates (FPR) values from this analysis revealed a strong correlation with CD4 T cell recovery (p < 0.0001). Transmitted drug resistance mutations, documented in 3/41 (7.3%) cases, were unrelated to the assigned antiretroviral regimen and had no impact on patient outcomes. In conclusion, naÏve HIV-1 R5 infected patients exhibited higher CD4 T cell counts at baseline; this difference was sustained throughout therapy.

Adjusting for HIV-1 RNA level at entry, a one percentage-point increase in these marker combinations was associated with a nine percent increase in the likelihood of maternal transmission. Total as well as naive CD4+ T cells were significantly higher in uninfected than infected infants. Total CD8+ cells, as well as CD8+ cells positive for HLA-DR+, CD45 RA+ HLA-DR+, and CD28+ HLA-DR+ were elevated in infected infants. Detailed immunophenotyping may be helpful in predicting which pregnant HIV-infected women are at increased risk of transmitting HIV to their infants. Increasing differences in lymphocyte subsets between infected and uninfected infants became apparent as early as six weeks of age. Detailed immunophenotyping may be useful in supporting the diagnosis of HIV infection in infants with perinatal HIV exposure."
15848,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are at increased risk of cardiovascular events. Reported non-invasive techniques for assessment of blood pressure in this population have been limited to sphygmomanometry. The present crosssectional study investigated the impact of antiretroviral therapy and the HAART-associated lipodystrophy on aortic blood pressure conditions and arterial stiffness in HAART-treated lipodystrophic (n=42) and non-lipodystrophic (n=17) patients. Pulse wave analysis, novel to this population, was used to evaluate measures of arterial stiffness, including the heart rate corrected augmentation index, AgI(HR). Results indicated no significant difference between the study groups in peripheral or aortic blood pressure and AgI(HR). Significant correlates of AgI(HR) included age (P = 0.003), duration of antiretroviral therapy (P = 0.020), lamivudine therapy (P = 0.015) and ritonavir therapy (P = 0.016) as well as cumulative exposure to protease inhibitors (P = 0.030). Time since HIV diagnosis, severity of immunodeficiency or presence of HAART-associated lipodystrophy bore no relationship to AgI(HR). In multivariate analysis, duration of antiretroviral therapy (P = 0.046), cumulative exposure to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (P = 0.032) and to protease inhibitors (P = 0.011) were identified as independent factors predicting AgI(HR). Prolonged antiretroviral treatment, thus, delineates as a risk factor for systemic arterial stiffness and the associated cardiovascular mortality."

Since periods of abstinence may be interspersed with drug misuse, it is necessary to establish the safety of zidovudine in injection drug misuse-related human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection under a variety of conditions. HIV serology became available in October 1985 and we have now examined medically 289 HIV seropositive patients, 85% of whom acquired their infection via injection drug misuse. Since March 1987 we have treated 40 individuals with zidovudine, 25 of whom were former or current injection drug misusers and one who was a heterosexual contact of a drug misuser. Eighteen patients were taking various types of opiates. Six of this latter group injected either occasionally or regularly whilst taking zidovudine. There were no adverse clinical events associated with zidovudine treatment and continued opiate drug misuse whether by mouth or by injection. Although defaults from clinic visits were a problem, these defaults were not associated with any particular form of drug misuse. Compliance with zidovudine therapy as judged by change in the mean corpuscular volume was no different for the various risk groups. In our experience it is possible to treat safely current and former drug misusers with zidovudine."

In this patient category, the safety of different immunosuppressive biologic therapies, including rituximab, was assessed. A total of 1218 Caucasian rheumatologic patients, admitted consecutively as outpatients between 2001 and 2012 and taking biologic therapies, underwent evaluation of anti-HCV and HBV markers as well as liver amino transferases every 3 months. Starting from January 2009, HBV DNA monitoring was performed in patients with a prHBV infection who had started immunosuppressive biologic therapy both before and after 2009. Patients were considered to have elevated aminotransferase levels if values were >1× upper normal limit at least once during follow-up. We found 179 patients with a prHBV infection (14 treated with rituximab, 146 with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and 19 with other biologic therapies) and 959 patients without a prHBV infection or other liver disease (controls). The mean age in the former group was significantly higher than the controls. Patients with a prHBV infection never showed detectable HBV DNA serum levels or antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen/hepatitis B surface antigen seroreversion. However, when the prevalence of elevated amino transferases in patients with prHBV infection was compared to controls, it was significantly higher in the former group only for aminotransferase levels >1× upper normal limit but not when aminotransferase levels >2× upper normal limit were considered."

We also review the management of chronic pain in special populations of PLWH, including persons with substance use and mental health disorders. Finally, a general review of possible pharmacokinetic interactions is included to assist the HIV clinician in the treatment of chronic pain in this population.It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients.

7704,0.005,1.0000,"A high heterogeneity is found in the HIV-1 genome in vivo, not only between individuals, but also within a single individual. Different types of genetic heterogeneity of HIV-1 can be analyzed: the extension and the evolution of the viral quasispecies in blood, the variation between the virus obtained from different body compartment, the differences between isolates from diverse individuals and between HIV-1 subtypes. The virus population during primary HIV-1 infection is generally homogeneous and the intrahost viral evolution is thought to be forced (in absence of antiviral therapy) by the immune system pressure and is generally related to the length of the immunocompetent period. A group of 12 Italian and Swedish well characterized HIV-1 infected long-term nonprogressors (LNTP) have been analyzed for the viral heterogeneity, calculated in the nef gene and in the long terminal repeat (LTR). The intra-sample variations in LTNP were found comparable with those from 8 progressor patients, while a lower inter-individual diversity was observed in the former. In one LTNP the viral evolution during a four-years period was extremely low suggesting that other factors than the host immune pressure may be involved in modulating the intra- and inter-sample HIV-1 diversity."
4373,0.005,1.0000,"Little is known of the experience of Latino youth with HIV infection in the United States, especially with respect to stressors and how these youth cope with said stressors. This study reports on a subset (Latino/Hispanic self-identified youth, n=14) of qualitatively interviewed youth (n=30), both in individual interviews and in focus group discussion settings, aware of their HIV diagnosis for 12-24 months (mean: 16.7 months; standard deviation [SD], 4.89) Youth were 16-24 years old (M=21.5 years), female (43%) and males (57%). Youth were recruited from three cities: Chicago, New York, and San Juan (Puerto Rico). Interviews of Latinos (n=14) were reviewed for sources of stressors and support. Seven themes emerged in analyzing stated sources of stressors: (1) initial psychosocial responses to HIV diagnosis, (2) disclosure to family and friends, (3) stigma related to receiving an HIV diagnosis, (4) body image and concerns of the physical changes associated with HIV and antiretroviral medications, (5) taking antiretroviral medications and side effects, (6) the disruption of their future life goals, and (7) reproductive health concerns. Identified sources of support and coping were described including; gaining appreciation for what matters in life, adapting and developing achievable goals, reordering priorities and relying on religion and spiritual beliefs for health outcomes. The information gathered is from individual interviews and from focus group discussions can be used to increase the understanding of this understudied population while improving services to engage and retain these youth in care."

Human immunodeficiency virus-infected subjects taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) were matched on age, race, and gender and were enrolled into one of the following two groups: group 1: subjects taking TDF plus lopinavir/ritonavir plus other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs); group 2: subjects taking TDF plus NRTIs and/or non-NRTIs but no protease inhibitors. Twenty-four-hour blood and urine collections were carried out in subjects for tenofovir quantification. Drug transporter genotype associations with tenofovir pharmacokinetics were examined. In 30 subjects, median (range) tenofovir apparent oral clearance, renal clearance, and fraction excreted in urine were 34.6 l/h (20.6-89.5), 11.3 l/h (6.2-22.6), and 0.33 (0.23-0.5), respectively. After adjusting for renal function, tenofovir renal clearance was 17.5% slower (P=0.04) in subjects taking lopinavir/ritonavir versus those not taking a protease inhibitor, consistent with a renal interaction between these drugs. Future studies should clarify the exact mechanism and whether there is an increased risk of nephrotoxicity."
6302,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of the study was to examine the interrelationships among HIV-related public and felt stigma, worry of HIV infection, HIV/AIDS knowledge and intention to disclose HIV testing results in a rural area of China, where HIV spread among former commercial blood donors. A one-group pretest-posttest study was conducted among 605 marriage license applicants. The following relationships showed statistical significance in path analysis: (1) HIV/AIDS knowledge --> worry [beta (Standardized coefficient) = -0.39]; (2) worry --> public stigma (beta = 0.27); (3) public stigma --> felt stigma (beta = 0.22); and (4) felt stigma --> intention to disclosure (beta = -0.20). Separate path analyses for males and females generated similar association patterns. HIV counseling reduced perceived worry but exerted little impact on HIV-related stigma and the intention. The pathway from a lack of HIV/AIDS knowledge to increased stigma and to decreased intention to disclose one's serostatus is particularly policy relevant as decreased intention to disclosure may be related to continuing practice of HIV risk behaviors. The findings demonstrate interventions aiming at the reduction of stigma should be targeted at both the individual and community levels."

4307,0.005,1.0000,"Some people living with HIV (PLHIV) refuse to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) despite availability. Between March 2010 and September 2011, using a social ecological framework, we investigated barriers to ART initiation in Lusaka, Zambia. In-depth interviews were conducted with PLHIV who were offered treatment but declined (n=37), ART staff (n=5), faith healers (n=5), herbal medicine providers (n=5), and home-based care providers (n=5). One focus group discussion with lay HIV counselors and observations in the community and at an ART clinic were conducted. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated, coded using Atlas ti, and analyzed using latent content analysis. Lack of self-efficacy, negative perceptions of medication, desire for normalcy, and fear of treatment-induced physical body changes, all modulated by feeling healthy, undermined treatment initiation. Social relationships generated and perpetuated these health and treatment beliefs. Long waiting times at ART clinics, concerns about long-term availability of treatment, and taking strong medication amidst livelihood insecurity also dissuaded PLHIV from initiating treatment. PLHIV opted for herbal remedies and faith healing as alternatives to ART, with the former being regarded as effective as ART, while the latter contributed to restoring normalcy through the promise of being healed. Barriers to treatment initiation were not mutually exclusive. Some coalesced to undermine treatment initiation. Ensuring patients initiate ART requires interventions at different levels, addressing, in particular, people's health and treatment beliefs, changing perceptions about effectiveness of herbal remedies and faith healing, improving ART delivery to attenuate social and economic costs and allaying concerns about future non-availability of treatment."
14756,0.005,1.0000,We assess the efficacy of pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) with ribavirin (RBV) and the predictors of sustained virological response (SVR) among HIV/hepatitis C virus genotype 4 (HCV-4)-coinfected patients. Thirty-nine (31.5%) of 124 individuals with HCV-4 achieved SVR compared with 103 (22.7%) of 453 individuals with HCV genotype 1 (P=0.046). Only interleukin-28B (IL28B) genotype CC was independently associated with SVR in HIV/HCV-4-coinfected patients. The efficacy of peg-IFN with RBV in coinfected individuals with genotype 4 is significantly higher than in those with genotype 1. IL28B CC genotype is the main predictor of response in this population.

2959,0.005,1.0000,"Convenient, non-food-dependent dosing, low tablet volume, and relatively low cost have made nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors a first choice for both clinicians and patients in Uganda. Concerns exist as to their efficacy in patients with viral loads (VL) above 100,000 copies/ml, a feature common to about 75% of HIV-1-infected patients presenting at the Joint Clinical Research Center (JCRC) in Uganda. Furthermore, there are few data on the response to such therapy of non-B subtypes, A and D, predominant in Uganda. Presented here is a retrospective analysis of therapeutic responses in 11 antiretroviral (ARV) naïve HIV-1-infected Ugandan patients who had been initiated on zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), and efavirenz (EFV). Laboratory assessments subsequent to initiation of ARV therapy, done at 11.6 +/- 3.9 weeks and 30.6 +/- 5.9 weeks, showed 88.9 and 71.4% patients achieved undetectable viral load, respectively. Virological suppression to below detection occurred in 85.7% of patients at 11.6 weeks despite baseline VL >or= 100,000 copies/ml. At 31 weeks there was a median increment of +183 cells/mm(3) in CD4(+) T lymphocytes. These findings reflect significant efficacy in the use of AZT + 3TC + EFV in advanced ARV naive non-B subtype HIV-1-infected patients. The therapeutic responses were comparable to those previously described in the western world."
15199,0.005,1.0000,"T20 (generic name, enfuvirtide; brand name, Fuzeon) is a first-generation human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) fusion inhibitor approved for salvage therapy of HIV-infected patients refractory to current antiretroviral drugs. However, its clinical use is limited because of rapid emergence of T20-resistant viruses in T20-treated patients. Therefore, T1249 and T1144 are being developed as the second- and third-generation HIV fusion inhibitors, respectively, with improved efficacy and drug resistance profiles. Here, we found that combinations of T20 with T1249 and/or T1144 resulted in exceptionally potent synergism (combination index, <0.01) against HIV-1-mediated membrane fusion by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude in dose reduction. Highly potent synergistic antiviral efficacy was also achieved against infection by laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 strains, including T20-resistant variants. The mechanism underlying the synergistic effect could be attributed to the fact that T20, T1249, and T1144 all contain different functional domains and have different primary binding sites in gp41. As such, they may work cooperatively to inhibit gp41 six-helix bundle core formation, thereby suppressing virus-cell fusion. Therefore, these findings strongly imply that, rather than replacing T20, combining it with HIV fusion inhibitors of different generations might produce synergistic activity against both T20-sensitive and -resistant HIV-1 strains, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection/AIDS."
17411,0.005,1.0000,"BACKGROUND The introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has considerably improved therapeutic outcomes for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. The AMBER-CEE study aimed to assess real-world efficacy and safety of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/+ dasabuvir ±ribavirin (OBV/PTV/r/ +DSV±RBV) in the treatment of post-transplant recurrence of HCV infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS Liver transplant recipients with recurrent HCV genotype 1 infection, scheduled for OBV/PTV/r/+DSV±RBV according to therapeutic guidelines, were eligible. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR) 12 weeks after the end of treatment (FU12). Clinical and laboratory adverse events (AEs) were recorded from baseline to FU12. RESULTS A total of 35 patients were included: 91.4% genotype 1b-infected, 94.3% treatment-experienced, and 77.1% at fibrosis stage ≥F2. SVR12 was achieved by all patients (35/35, 100%) including one patient with genotype 1a, one patient with detectable HCV RNA at the end of treatment, two patients with a history of first-generation DAA therapy, and two patients who prematurely discontinued the regimen. AEs were experienced by 22 patients (62.9%) and were mostly mild. No death, graft loss, or acute graft rejections were reported during the therapy. On-treatment hepatic decompensation occurred in three patients (8.6%). Anemia was observed in 29 patients (83.9%), with 21 (60%) requiring RBV dose reduction or discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS OBV/PTV/r/+DSV±RBV has excellent efficacy in post-transplant recurrence of HCV genotype 1-infection treated under real-world conditions. Excellent virologic outcomes were observed irrespective of prior treatment history or the degree of fibrosis, and AEs were mostly mild and transient."

Our aim was to assess the effects of peginterferon-α 2a and ribavirin plasma levels on viral kinetics and SVR in hepatitis C virus genotype 1 HCV-1/HIV-co-infected patients according to IL28B genotype. This was a cohort study of HCV-1/HIV-co-infected patients who were HCV-treatment naïve and for whom the efficacy of peginterferon-α 2a plus ribavirin was evaluated by per-protocol analysis. The peginterferon-α 2a and ribavirin levels were measured by ELISA and HPLC-UV, respectively. The relationships among host and viral factors, the trough drugs levels and virological responses were analysed by multivariate regression analyses. A total of 131 Caucasian patients were included (cirrhosis:38.9%). Overall, SVR rate was 39.6%. In patients with CC IL28B genotype, SVR was related neither to peginterferon-α 2a nor to ribavirin plasma levels, while higher levels of both drugs were the only variables independently associated with SVR in individuals with CT/TT IL28B genotypes (OR, 5.02; CI95 , 1.45-17.1; P = 0.001 and 4.0; CI95 , 1.08-14.7; P = 0.038, respectively). Moreover, faster viral declines were observed in CT/TT patients when pegIFN-α 2a and ribavirin plasma levels were greater than 3400 pg/mL and 1.6 μg/mL, respectively. In contrast to the results for CC patients, the results in patients carrying the unfavourable CT/TT IL28B genotypes showed that plasma levels of both drugs have significant effects on viral kinetics and SVR.

10380,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), that includes human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors (PIs), has been remarkably efficacious including against some opportunistic infections. In this report we investigated the effect(s) of the PI indinavir on protease activity by Cryptococcus neoformans, an opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for recurrent meningoencephalitis in AIDS patients. Indinavir was also tested for potential effects on other parameters, such as fungal viability, growth ability and susceptibility to immune effector cells. It was found that indinavir impaired cryptococcal protease activity in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. The phenomenon was similarly detectable in ATCC/laboratory strains and clinical isolates. C. neoformans growth rate was also significantly reduced upon exposure to indinavir, while fungal viability was not affected and mitochondrial toxicity not detected. Furthermore, as assessed by an in vitro infection model, indinavir significantly and consistently augmented C. neoformans susceptibility to microglial cell-mediated phagocytosis and killing. Overall, by providing the first evidence that indinavir directly affects C. neoformans, these data add new in vitro insights on the wide-spectrum efficacy of PIs, further arguing for the clinical relevance of HAART against opportunistic infections in AIDS."
18123,0.005,1.0000,"In an 8-month period nine patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were diagnosed as having visceral leishmaniasis; all diagnoses were based on cultures (eight from bone marrow and one from the skin). Visceral leishmaniasis developed before full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in seven patients and at the same time as or after AIDS in the other two patients. Three patients had a history of leishmaniasis. Clinical manifestations and laboratory findings were atypical. Leishmania species were cultured from samples taken from all patients; however, six patients had an insignificant antileishmanial antibody titer and Leishmania amastigotes were not seen in their bone marrow smears. Four isolates were identified by isoenzyme analysis as Leishmania donovani infantum. Five patients died, including two patients who had completed at least one 3-week course of therapy with N-methylglucamine antimoniate. Screening should be done for visceral leishmaniasis in patients with HIV infection who live or travel in areas where the disease is endemic. The diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis may frequently be missed if cultures are not done."

The results demonstrated significantly higher undercarboxylated osteocalcin and pentosidine in PI-treated patients. Switching to integrase strand transfer inhibitor significant decreased these markers. We also showed impaired bone mechanical properties with higher undercarboxylated osteocalcin level in PI-treated mice and inhibited osteoblast differentiation in PI-treated osteogenic cells.

15833,0.005,1.0000,"The emergence of drug-resistant variants during antiretroviral therapy is a serious obstacle to sustained suppression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). For that reason, resistance assays are essential to guide clinicians in the selection of optimal treatment regimens. Genotypic assays are less expensive and results are available faster than phenotypic assays. However, in heavily experienced patients with multiple treatment failures interpretation of complex mutation patterns remains difficult, and in these cases phenotypic assays are recommended. This report describes a novel recombinant virus assay where protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences derived from the plasma isolated from patients are introduced into the back-bone of an HIV molecular clone that expresses Renilla luciferase protein in the place of nef gene. All drug resistance profiles analyzed correlate with previously reported data and showed high reproducibility. This assay, in addition to a fast (completed in 10 days), precise, reproducible and automated method, presents several advantages as compared to other phenotypic assays. The system described below allows the generation of recombinant viruses with multiples cycles of replication carrying a reporter gene in their genomes. These features increase the sensitivity of the test, an important aspect to be considered in the evaluation of less fit viral isolates. In conclusion, the assay permits the quantitation of the level of resistance of clinical HIV-1 isolates to PR and RT inhibitors."
18249,0.005,1.0000,"In order to investigate the potential susceptibility of bone marrow stromal myoid cells to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a myoid cell population devoid of all other cellular components of marrow environment was isolated from 3 normal adult bone marrow samples. The bone marrow myoid cells were infected with 3 different strains of HIV-1, 2 strains isolated from patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HTLV-IIIB strain. To demonstrate successful infection and HIV production, culture supernatants, harvested weekly until 2 months post-infection, were tested for the presence of p24 antigen and infectious virus. Myoid cell monolayers obtained from the 3 different bone marrow samples were shown to be susceptible to infection. In particular, infection led to the presence of p24 antigen and of infectious virus in culture supernatants up to day 49 post-infection. After day 49, it was not possible to demonstrate the presence of infectious virus in culture supernatants and HIV-DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) failed to show viral genome in any of the cultures assayed. Our results demonstrate the susceptibility of myoid stromal cells to HIV infection and may provide an in vitro model for studying the effects of HIV infection in disregulation of the haemopoietic function of bone marrow environment."

Respondents were recruited from seven AIDS service organizations in New York City, and the total sample consisted of 196 HIV-infected individuals. The sample consisted largely of heterosexual, African Americans, and Latinos. Respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire that was made available in English or Spanish. Three-quarters of the sample were receiving protease inhibitor combination therapies. Overall, respondents reported a high level of life satisfaction as well as trust in their medical providers. Health worries and financial worries were the main areas of concern. A significant minority of respondents indicated reduced concern about AIDS and the need for continued safer sex practices, because of the latest treatments. Respondents with greater quality-of-life concerns were more likely to believe that AIDS was less severe now and that safer sex was less important."
12653,0.005,1.0000,"Early changes in hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels were assessed in a large cohort of African American and white patients with chronic hepatitis C due to HCV genotype 1 who underwent therapy with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin in the Study of Viral Resistance to Antiviral Therapy of Hepatitis C (Virahep-C). Analyses were restricted to 341 patients who completed the first 28 days of therapy without dose modification. HCV RNA levels decreased in virtually all patients, but the amount of the change varied markedly. The overall 28-day decrease in HCV RNA levels was at least as predictive of a sustained virological response as the first- or second-phase viral kinetics responses. Factors associated with a smaller decrease in the HCV RNA level between baseline and day 28 included African American race, higher initial HCV RNA level, more severe hepatic fibrosis, and higher body weight. African American patients with similar 28-day decreases in viral levels as white patients were still less likely to achieve a sustained virological response. These results suggest that racial differences in the response to antiviral therapy are due to greater unresponsiveness to intracellular actions of interferon in African American individuals and that standard doses of peginterferon and ribavirin may be suboptimal for patients with higher body weights.

8884,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated maternal sexual behavior and injection drug use practices as possible risk factors for vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Data were analyzed from the Mothers and Infants Cohort Study, a prospective study in Brooklyn and the Bronx, New York. A total of 207 mother-infant sets were enrolled between 1986 and 1991 and followed for up to 4 years after the enrollment visit during pregnancy. HIV-1 transmission occurred in 49 of 201 mother-infant sets, yielding an overall transmission rate of 24.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 18.7% to 31.0%). Increased frequency of vaginal intercourse after the first trimester of pregnancy was positively associated with vertical transmission of HIV-1 (trend p = 0.03). A lifetime history of injection drug use was not associated with vertical transmission. However, a history of combined cocaine and heroin injection after the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with vertical HIV-1 transmission, particularly among women with CD4+ lymphocyte levels of 20% or higher (risk ratio = 4.0; 95% CI = 2.0 to 8.1). Cocaine and heroin injection drug use after the first trimester accounted for most of the relation between preterm birth and vertical HIV-1 transmission in this cohort. Maternal coinfection with hepatitis C virus or human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II could not explain these observations, because coinfection with these viruses had no detectable effect on HIV-1 transmission. These results suggest that maternal sexual behavior and injection drug use practices during the second and third trimester of pregnancy may modify the risk of vertical HIV-1 transmission."

A global outcome measure (encompassing symptom relief, functioning, and HIV-risk behaviors), and a measure of abstinence from alcohol and illicit substances were used. Fifty percent of patients improved, with 19% ""nearly well"" at follow-up. Abstinence was achieved 48% of the time. Good compliance with treatment and the absence of injection drug use were the primary predictors of good outcomes. Of the compliant patients, 94% improved, with 45.7% being nearly well. Psychiatric treatment of HIV-infected patients is effective when located in the HIV primary-care setting and administered by a multidisciplinary team under the direction of a psychiatrist, using evidence-based interventions."
8416,0.005,1.0000,"While research has begun addressing food insecurity (FI) in HIV-positive populations, knowledge regarding FI among individuals living with HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection is limited. This exploratory study examines sociodemographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, and clinical factors associated with FI in a cohort of HIV-HCV co-infected individuals in Canada. We analyzed longitudinal data from the Food Security and HIV-HCV Co-infection Study of the Canadian Co-infection Cohort collected between November 2012-June 2014 at 15 health centres. FI was measured using the Household Food Security Survey Module and classified using Health Canada criteria. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess factors associated with FI. Among 525 participants, 59 % experienced FI at their first study visit (baseline). Protective factors associated with FI (p < 0.05) included: enrolment at a Quebec study site (aOR: 0.42, 95 % CI: 0.27, 0.67), employment (aOR: 0.55, 95 % CI: 0.35, 0.87), and average personal monthly income (aOR per $100 CAD increase: 0.98, 95 % CI: 0.97, 0.99). Risk factors for FI included: recent injection drug use (aOR: 1.98, 95 % CI: 1.33, 2.96), trading away food (aOR: 5.23, 95 % CI: 2.53, 10.81), and recent experiences of depressive symptoms (aOR: 2.11, 95 % CI: 1.48, 3.01). FI is common in this co-infected population. Engagement of co-infected individuals in substance use treatments, harm reduction programs, and mental health services may mitigate FI in this vulnerable subset of the HIV-positive population."
19902,0.005,1.0000,"Recidivism is a pervasive problem facing the incarcerated. Incarcerated persons who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected often have multiple risk factors associated with initial incarceration and recidivism, in particular, injection drug use. Yet, some jails provide case management for HIV-infected inmates to provide continuity of health care, which might have positive effects on reentry into the community. We sought to measure recidivism and factors related to recidivism in an HIV-infected cohort in an urban county jail with an active case management program. Fifty-two inmates surveyed in 1999 at the San Francisco County Jail were followed for rearrests through 2006. In follow-up, 73% were re-incarcerated on an average of 6.8 times for 552 days. Risk factors included nonwhite ethnicity, history of homelessness and crack use, common risk factors for incarceration. Less than high school education was associated with recidivism, shorter time to reincarceration, and more incarcerations. HIV-infected inmates spend a high proportion of time in multiple incarcerations, a reflection of the cyclical nature of incarceration despite comprehensive case management. Well-known risk factors for incarceration were associated with recidivism; in addition, lack of high school education played a prominent role. Education should be explored as a way to make further progress on breaking the cycle of incarceration."
19580,0.005,1.0000,"The e determinant of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBS Ag) was found in 23 of 42 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Presence of e antigen was associated with increases in DNA polymerase activity and in the number of circulating Dane particles. In the group with detectable e antigen, the average DNA polymerase activity was 367+/-78 counts per minute (cpm; mean+/-standard error [SE]), and the average number of Dane particles counted in electron micrographs was 4.4% of the total HBS Ag. In contrast, e antigen-negative patients had an average DNA polymerase activity of 40+/-6.9 cpm (P less than 0.1) and an average Dane particle count equal to 0.6% of the HBS Ag. The e antigen was detected in 68% of patients who were HBS Ag carriers or had persistent viral hepatitis and 40% of those with chronic active type B hepatitis. Thus, the presence of e antigen correlated with both the chronicity and presence of infectious HBV. However, it did not correlate with the type or severity of liver disease after HBV infection, since e antigen was present in both chronic benign and chronic aggressive hepatitis B infections."
13679,0.005,1.0000,"Needle exchange programs (NEPs) are designed to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission among injection drug users. Although most studies report beneficial effects in terms of behavior modification, a direct assessment of the effectiveness of NEPs in preventing HIV infection has been lacking. A cohort study was conducted to assess the association between risk behaviors and HIV seroprevalence and seroincidence among injection drug users in Montreal, Canada. The association between NEP use and HIV infection was examined in three risk assessment scenarios using intensive covariate adjustment for empirical confounders: a cross-sectional analysis of NEP use at entry as a determinant of seroprevalence, a cohort analysis of NEP use at entry as a predictor of subsequent seroconversion, and a nested case-control analysis of NEP participation during follow-up as a predictor of seroconversion. From September 1988 to January 1995, 1,599 subjects were enrolled with a baseline seroprevalence of 10.7%. The mean follow-up period was 21.7 months. The adjusted odds ratio for HIV seroprevalence in injection drug users reporting recent NEP use was 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.5-3.2). In the cohort study, there were 89 incident cases of HIV infection with a cumulative probability of HIV seroconversion of 33% for NEP users and 13% for nonusers (p < 0.0001). In the nested case-control study, consistent NEP use was associated with HIV seroconversion during follow-up (odds ratio = 10.5, 95% confidence interval 2.7-41.0). Risk elevations for HIV infection associated with NEP attendance were substantial and consistent in all three risk assessment scenarios in our cohort of injection drug users, despite extensive adjustment for confounders. In summary, in Montreal, NEP users appear to have higher seroconversion rates then NEP nonusers."
9387,0.005,1.0000,"As a result of antiretroviral therapeutic strategies, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection has become a long-term clinically manageable chronic disease for many infected individuals. However, despite this progress in therapeutic control, including undetectable viral loads and CD4+ T-cell counts in the normal range, viral mutations continue to accumulate in the peripheral blood compartment over time, indicating either low level reactivation and/or replication. Using patients from the Drexel Medicine CNS AIDS Research and Eradication Study (CARES) Cohort, whom have been sampled longitudinally for more than 7 years, genetic change was modeled against to the dominant integrated proviral quasispecies with respect to selection pressures such as therapeutic interventions, AIDS defining illnesses, and other factors. Phylogenetic methods based on the sequences of the LTR and tat exon 1 of the HIV-1 proviral DNA quasispecies were used to obtain an estimate of an average mutation rate of 5.3 nucleotides (nt)/kilobasepair (kb)/year (yr) prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Following ART the baseline mutation rate was reduced to an average of 1.02 nt/kb/yr. The post-ART baseline rate of genetic change, however, appears to be unique for each patient. These studies represent our initial steps in quantifying rates of genetic change among HIV-1 quasispecies using longitudinally sampled sequences from patients at different stages of disease both before and after initiation of combination ART. Notably, while long-term ART reduced the estimated mutation rates in the vast majority of patients studied, there was still measurable HIV-1 mutation even in patients with no detectable virus by standard quantitative assays. Determining the factors that affect HIV-1 mutation rates in the peripheral blood may lead to elucidation of the mechanisms associated with changes in HIV-1 disease severity."
11272,0.005,1.0000,"Injection drug use is the main mechanism of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission in Argentina (40% of reported AIDS cases in Argentina). This study was conducted among street-recruited injection drug users (IDUs) from Buenos Aires, with the aim of estimating seroprevalence and coinfection of HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs). A total of 174 volunteers participated in this study; 137 were men (78.7% of volunteers). The average age of the participants was 30 years. Only 64 of participants (37%) had no viral infection, whereas 110 (63%) were infected with > or =1 viruses. Seroprevalences were 44.3% for HIV, 54.6% for HCV, 42.5% for HBV, 2.3% for HTLV-I, and 14.5% for HTLV-II. Among the 77 HIV-infected persons, only 6.5% (5 persons) were not coinfected with other viruses; 88.3% (68) were coinfected with HCV and 68.8% (53) were coinfected with HBV. We demonstrated the existence of multiple viral infections with a high rate of prevalence in IDUs in Buenos Aires, Argentina."

7885,0.005,1.0000,"Given that low muscle mass can lead to worse health outcomes in patients with chronic infections, we assessed whether chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was associated with low muscle mass among US adults. We performed a cross-sectional study of the National Health Examination and Nutrition Study (1999-2010). Chronic HCV-infected patients had detectable HCV RNA. Low muscle mass was defined as <10th percentile for mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of low muscle mass associated with chronic HCV. Among 18 513 adults, chronic HCV-infected patients (n = 303) had a higher prevalence of low muscle mass than uninfected persons (13.8% vs 6.7%; aOR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.39-3.56), and this association remained when analyses were repeated among persons without significant liver fibrosis (aOR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.30-3.47). This study demonstrates that chronic HCV infection is associated with low muscle mass, as assessed by MUAC measurements, even in the absence of advanced liver disease. "

When he was 53 years old, he developed oral candidiasis and serum human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA was detected. After starting highly active antiretroviral therapy, serum HIV RNA became undetectable. Neurological examination revealed ptosis and bulbar symptoms. Myasthenia gravis was comfirmed by a positive edrophonium test, showing 20% decrement of the compound muscle action potential on repetitive stimulation. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies were negative and anti-muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies were positive. The chest CT scan was normal. He experienced transient clinical remission with pyridostigmine bromide and prednisolone. However relapse occurred after he returned to work. Persistent clinical remission was first observed after cyclosporin administration. There are eleven reports in which patients had concomitant myasthenia gravis and HIV infection. Most of those cases were benign in clinical course and required only anticholinesterase therapy. In our case, however, anti-MuSK antibodies were positive, and symptoms of myasthenia gravis remained despite prednisolone administration. Cyclosporin is directly active against HIV, and thus, cyclosporine therapy may be helpful in patients with concomitant myasthenia gravis and HIV infection."

The population pharmacokinetics of EVG in treatment-naive and -experienced HIV patients was determined, and the effects of demographic, biometric, and formulation covariates on EVG pharmacokinetics (PK) were evaluated. Data from 31 clinical studies (25 in healthy subjects, 6 phase 1b to phase 3 in HIV-1-infected patients) with COBI-boosted EVG studies (as EVG/co or EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF single-tablet regimen) or RTV-boosted EVG studies (EVG/r) were analyzed using NONMEM. The effect of the covariates age, sex, race, health status (healthy volunteers vs HIV patients), weight, body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), creatinine clearance (estimated GFR), and formulation were evaluated. EVG PK, with COBI or RTV, was described by a 2-compartment model, with first-order absorption and elimination and an absorption lag time. A statistically significant, but not clinically relevant, effect of BSA on EVG clearance (CL) was observed. Coadministration of atazanavir or lopinavir with EVG/r had an effect on EVG CL consistent with the known interaction with these agents. No other covariate had a meaningful effect on EVG PK. EVG PK was well described in a population PK model with HIV-infected patients, with low PK variability and no relevant effect of demographic or biometric covariates."
4097,0.005,1.0000,"Therapeutic goals for HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy include minimizing risk of future physical disability. Presarcopenia and sarcopenia precede age-associated physical disability. We investigated their prevalence and the predictive value of patient mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) for them. Eighty community-dwelling patients ≥45 years old demonstrating durable viral suppression were evaluated. Sarcopenia was defined as low skeletal muscle index (SMI, skeletal muscle kg/height m(2)) and either low strength or poor performance by handgrip dynamometry and gait speed, respectively. Presarcopenia was defined as low SMI only. MUAC was interpreted according to National Health Statistics percentile. Prevalence of sarcopenia and presarcopenia was 5.0% and 20.0%, respectively. Male gender (odds ratio [OR] 10.72; P < .026), recreational psychoactive substance use (OR 5.13; P < .037), and intravenous drug use transmission category (OR 6.94; P <.0327) were associated with presarcopenia. Higher body mass index (OR 0.80; P < .0007), MUAC (OR 0.83; P < .024), and large skeletal frame (OR 0.09; P < .003) were negatively associated with presarcopenia. Finding that a participant did not have a MUAC <25th percentile on physical examination had a 90.4% negative predictive value for presarcopenia. Although sarcopenia was uncommon, presarcopenia was highly prevalent in midlife and older HIV-infected males. Determination of MUAC percentile may identify those least likely to demonstrate skeletal muscle deficit and improve patient selection for mass and function testing. "
3408,0.005,1.0000,"Myocarditis is a well-recognized cardiac manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and alterations in the immune system likely play an important role in the pathogenesis of heart muscle disease in HIV-infected patients. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly improved survival in HIV patients but not without uncovering new and unique manifestations of disease. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is a collection of inflammatory disorders in which a pathologic inflammatory response and clinical deterioration occur during recovery of the immune system after HAART. To our knowledge, a correlation between immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and HIV-associated myocarditis has not been described previously. We report a case of acute myocarditis presenting with refractory ventricular arrhythmias in a patient with AIDS who experienced rapid immune recovery with the initiation of HAART. The case underscores the importance of recognizing this potential complication of AIDS treatment and calls for renewed vigilance concerning cardiac manifestations of HIV, especially during the immune reconstitution phase."

Therefore, the association of single nucleotide polymorphism of interleukin (IL)-18 promoter region in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was examined. The results demonstrated the significant involvement of genotype A/A at position -607 in patients (n = 140) when compared with healthy individuals (n = 140) [OR (95% CI) = 2.62 (1.36-5.09), P(c)= 0.009]. The frequencies of -607A/A, C/A, C/C genotypes were 27.86%, 48.57% and 23.57% in chronic HBV patients and 12.80%, 59.30% and 27.90% in healthy controls, respectively. No significant association at the position -137 was found between the two groups. The frequencies of -607A/-137G haplotype homozygosity were higher in the chronic HBV patients (17.14%) than in the controls (8.57%) [OR (95% CI) = 2.21 (1-4.93), P = 0.05], although this was not statistically significant when corrected for multiple comparison (P(c)= 0.40). In conclusion, this study proposes that A/A genotype at position -607 in IL-18 gene can be used as a new genetic maker in Thai population for predicting chronic hepatitis B development."

AIDS-related stigma and conflict may create distress and deteriorate quality of life (QoL) of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). This cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study using structural questionnaires aimed to explore the stress, needs, QoL, and associated factors of PLWHA in Taiwan. A total of 200 PLWHA participating in this study needed most on treatment of HIV and prevention of AIDS, and health maintenance. They had worse QoL in physical, psychological, and social domains (all p < 0.001) than the general population. Stress was the most significant predictor (β = -0.25 to -0.54, p < 0.01) for all four domains of QoL. Needs was not significantly associated with QoL. The QoL of PLWHA can be explained by demographics, self-perception on health, needs, and stress for 25.3-40.7% of variances. No association existed between CD4(+) counts and QoL in Taiwanese PLWHA. It is important to recognize the perception of PLWHA on their health status, which is significantly associated with their QoL, besides monitoring their physical indicators of health (CD4(+) counts). To recognize the stress and needs that PLWHA experience and to develop intervention programs targeting strategies on HIV disclosure, prevention and health maintenance are crucial for PLWHA's QoL. "
10333,0.005,1.0000,"Sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (Imuthiol, DTC) has previously been observed to promote T-cell maturation in animal models and to reduce lymphadenopathy and improve survival in a murine AIDS model. In addition, several clinical studies have suggested that one dosage regimen may be active in patients with HIV infection. We conducted a randomized, controlled dose response study of intravenous DTC in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex (ARC). Drug associated toxicities included gastrointestinal upset, burning at the infusion site, metallic taste, sneezing, confusional states, hyperactivity, delusional thinking, and myoclonus. Toxicity was ameliorated by dose reduction. The maximally tolerated dose varied for individual patients from 200 mg/m2 weekly to 800 mg/m2 twice weekly. No myelosuppression was observed. In patients with greater than 200 CD4+ cells/uL, a statistically significant reduction of lymphadenopathy occurred; whereas no beneficial effects were observed in patients with less than 200 CD4+ cells/uL. Improvement in symptom score and stabilization of CD4+ count also occurred in the treated group, although these trends did not reach statistical significance. Further controlled clinical trials of DTC in earlier HIV infection are warranted."
11214,0.005,1.0000,"Viral dynamic modelling has proven useful for designing clinical studies and predicting treatment outcomes for patients infected with the hepatitis C virus. Generally these models aim to capture and predict the on-treatment viral load dynamics from a small study of individual patients. Here, we explored extending these models (1) to clinical studies with numerous patients and (2) by incorporating additional data types, including sequence data and prior response to interferon. Data from Phase 3 clinical studies of the direct-acting antiviral telaprevir (T; total daily dose of 2250 mg) combined with pegylated-interferon alfa and ribavirin (PR) were used for the analysis. The following data in the treatment-naïve population were reserved to verify the model: (1) a T/PR regimen where T was dosed every 8 h for 8 weeks (T8(q8h)/PR) and (2) a T/PR regimen where T was dosed twice daily for 12 weeks (T12(b.i.d.)/PR). The resulting model accurately predicted (1) sustained virologic response rates for both of these dosing regimens and (2) viral breakthrough characteristics of the T8(q8h)/PR regimen. Since the observed viral variants depend on the T exposure, the second verification suggested that the model was correctly sensitive to the different T regimen even though the model was developed using data from another T regimen. Furthermore, the model predicted that b.i.d. T dosing was comparable to q8h T dosing in the PR-experienced population, a comparison that has not been made in a controlled clinical study. The methods developed in this work to estimate the variability occurring below the limit of detection for the viral load were critical for making accurate predictions."
3680,0.005,1.0000,"Proximal renal tubular dysfunction (PRTD) of varying severity has been associated with antiretroviral toxicity, especially related to the use of tenofovir (TDF). The aim of this study was to investigate whether HIV-infected patients who use a tenofovir-based regimen are at increased risk of tubular dysfunction. We conducted an observational, comparative, longitudinal, prospective study. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and markers of tubular damage to assess tubular dysfunction (fractional excretion of phosphate and uric acid, glycosuria, and proteinuria) were measured at baseline and at weeks 12 and 24. Of 111 participants, PRTD was found in 6.3% at week 12 and 9% at week 24, with no statistically significant difference between those on an abacavir (ABC)-containing regimen or a TDF-containing regimen. We also found an increase in triglycerides associated with the ABC-containing regimen compared with the TDF group. The use of an ABC- or TDF-containing regimen was independently associated with tubular dysfunction, but we found no significant differences between these groups, except when TDF was combined with a protease inhibitor. A better and more complete assessment of renal function is needed, because the presence of tubular dysfunction and proteinuria without impairment of eGFR may affect the renal safety of HIV-infected patients."
16840,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the receipt of antiretroviral therapy have been associated with the development of cardiovascular disease. The occurrence of cardiovascular events in HIV-infected patients has often been associated with treatment-induced dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and body composition changes. These treatment-related complications are often the result of exposures to protease inhibitors or thymidine analogs such as stavudine or zidovudine. Recent investigations, however, have suggested an association between exposure to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, abacavir, and the occurrence of cardiovascular disease events. Based on these findings, current guidelines recommend using caution in patients receiving abacavir who are at a high risk for cardiovascular disease. Decisions to replace abacavir in a patient's regimen should be considered on an individual basis and with complete evaluation of the associated benefits and risks. Furthermore, additional studies are necessary to definitively determine the association between abacavir exposure and the occurrence of cardiovascular disease events. Studies are also necessary to definitively identify the contributions of both HIV infection and individual antiretroviral agents on the development of cardiovascular disease."

This qualitative study investigated the barriers and facilitators to cART adherence among Peruvian adolescents living with HIV. Guided by a social ecological model, we analyzed transcripts from 24 psychosocial support groups for HIV-positive adolescents aged 13-17 years and 15 individual, in-depth interviews with cART providers and caregivers to identify the barriers and facilitators to cART adherence at the individual, family/caregiver and hospital levels. Most barriers and facilitators to cART adherence clustered at the individual and family/caregiver levels, centering on support provided to adolescents; history of declining health due to suboptimal cART adherence; side effects from antiretroviral drugs; and cART misinformation. Interventions to support adolescent HIV cART adherence should begin at the individual and family/caregiver levels and include an educational component. No adolescent living with HIV should die from AIDS in an era of accessible cART."

However, there is limited information available on estrogens and their function in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pituitary and testicular endocrine markers: 14 HIV-positive men were included into the longitudinal study with a follow up to of 18 month period. None of the patients had a history or clinical evidence of endocrine dysfunction. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin, estrone, estradiol, and testosterone were measured in serum by commercially available radioimmunoassays. Prolactin levels were not affected in the patients. LH and FSH remained within normal range, but at the end of the study period we observed a significant increase of LH (p < 0.05). In addition, testosterone levels were normal with a slight reduction at the end of the 18-month observation period (p <0.05). Both estrone and estradiol were significantly increased with a further rise at the end of the study (p <0.05). In summary, the elevation of the serum estrone and estradiol in HIV-afflicted patients correlated with the progress of the HIV-disease, being paralleled by a decrease in testosterone. The altered relation of estrogens and testosterone may in a part be responsible for the complaints of decreased libido and increased impotence often observed in HIV-infected men."
19295,0.005,1.0000,"Semen represents the main vector for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) dissemination worldwide and has been shown to harbor replication-competent virus despite otherwise effective highly active anti-retroviral therapy, which achieves undetectable viral load in plasma. Despite this, the origin of seminal HIV particles remains unclear, as does the question of whether the male genital tract organs contribute virus to semen. Here we investigated the presence of HIV receptors within the human testis using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We also analyzed the infectivity of a dual tropic HIV-1 strain in an organotypic culture, as well as the impact of viral exposure on testosterone production. Our study establishes that CXCR4+, CCR5+, CD4+, and DC-SIGN+ cells are present within the interstitial tissue of human testis and that these molecules persist throughout our organotypic culture. Our data also reveal that the human testis is permissive to HIV-1 and supports productive infection, leaving testosterone production apparently unaffected. Infected cells appeared to be testicular macrophages located within the interstitial tissue. That the testis itself represents a potential source of virus in semen could play a role in preventing viral eradication from semen because this organ constitutes a pharmacological sanctuary for many current antiretrovirals."

Preventive HBV vaccination is less effective in HIV-infected patients than in those without HIV infection. Emtricitabine, lamivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir) each have activity against HIV and HBV. In HBV/HIV-coinfected patients, if HBV or HIV treatment is needed, it should be initiated with tenofovir and emtricitabine or tenofovir and lamivudine as the nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone of a fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen. If HBV treatment is needed and tenofovir cannot be used safely, entecavir is recommended in addition to a fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen. Initiation of treatment for HBV infection is based on the presence of cirrhosis and on HBV DNA level, alanine aminotransferase level, and biopsy results. Current HBV treatments are associated with low functional cure rates. This article summarizes a presentation by Kenneth E.

Many studies have been undertaken on factors affecting adherence to ART; however, there is little information about Laos. Hence, this qualitative study examines barriers to and facilitators of adherence specific to this context. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were undertaken with 43 people living with HIV (PLHIV) currently on ART across 2 hospitals in Laos: Setthathirath hospital in the capital Vientiane and Savannakhet Province hospital. Interviews were based on semistructured question guides and were undertaken in Lao, translated into English and audio-recorded for later analysis. Major barriers to adherence reported by participants included transport costs, distance to the hospital, and stigma and discrimination. Key facilitators discussed were the perceived benefits of medication, social support, and the acceptance of HIV status. "

In this paper, we describe a system that manages and shares antiretroviral therapy information of 4438 HIV patients in three healthcare centers in Hanoi capital of Vietnam. The overall design considerations, architecture and the integration of centralized database and decentralized management for the system are also presented. The findings from this study can serve as a guide to consider in the implementation model of health care to manage and share information of patients not only in HIV infection, but also in the other chronic and non-communicable diseases.

Female study participants were involved with more group-based social networks but had fewer personal social networks in comparison to males. Access to network resources was higher among females and those from larger households but lower among older study participants. Experience of social support significantly increased with household economic status and duration at current residence. Social capital indicators were unrelated to HIV disease status indicators, including duration since diagnosis, CD4 count and viral load. Only a minority (13%) of study participants took part in groups formed by and for predominantly PLHIV (HIV support groups), and participation in such groups was unrelated to their mental or physical health. Personal rather than group-linked social networks and access to network resources were significantly associated with mental but not physical health, after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. The findings of limited participation in HIV support groups and that the participation in such groups was not significantly associated with physical or mental health may suggest efforts among PLHIV in South Africa to normalise HIV as a chronic illness through broad-based rather than HIV-status bounded social participation, as a strategy for deflecting stigma. Further research is required to examine the effects of HIV treatment on social networking and participation among PLHIV within both rural and other urban settings of South Africa."

This article summarizes the key findings and lessons learned from these projects, and examines cross-cutting issues such as stigma, quality of life, and sexual-risk behaviors among people living with HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome on antiretroviral therapy.

733,0.005,1.0000,"Achievement of a sustained virologic response (SVR) with antiviral therapy significantly improves graft survival in hepatitis C virus (HCV) monoinfected liver transplant (LT) patients. Risks and benefits of HCV therapy in HCV-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfected LT recipients are not well established. Among 89 HCV-HIV LT recipients in the HIVTR cohort, 39 (23% Black, 79% genotype 1, 83% fibrosis stage ≤ 1) were treated with peginterferon-a2a or a2b plus ribavirin for a median 363 days (14-1373). On intent-to-treat basis, 22% (95% CI: 10-39) and 14% (95% CI: 5-30) achieved an end-of-treatment response (EOTR) and SVR, respectively. By per-protocol analysis (completed 48 weeks of therapy ± dose reductions), 42% and 26% had EOTR and SVR, respectively. Severe adverse events occurred in 85%, with 26% hospitalized with infections and 13% developing acute rejection. Early discontinuations and dose reductions occurred in 38% and 82%, respectively, despite use of growth factors in 85%. Eighteen of 39 treated patients (46%) subsequently died/had graft loss, with 10 (26%) attributed to recurrent HCV. In conclusion, SVR rates are low and tolerability is poor in HCV-HIV coinfected transplant recipients treated with peginterferon and ribavirin. These results highlight the critical need for better tolerated and more efficacious HCV therapies for HCV-HIV coinfected transplant recipients."
12889,0.005,1.0000,"Decompensated liver disease associated with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common indication for liver transplantation. It was shown previously that greater pretransplantation HCV titers are associated with relatively poor patient and graft survival. The tolerability and efficacy of antiviral therapy in patients with decompensated liver disease are not known. We conducted a pilot study to determine the likely tolerability and efficacy of pretransplantation antiviral therapy with interferon alfa-2b, with or without ribavirin. HCV RNA-positive patients at or near the top of their respective waiting lists were randomly assigned to one of three treatment regimens until the time of liver transplantation: (1) group A, interferon alfa-2b, 1 x 10(6) U/d; (2) group B, interferon alfa-2b, 3 x 10(6) U three times weekly; or (3) group C, interferon alfa-2b, 1 x 10(6) U/d, plus ribavirin, 400 mg twice daily. Less than half the patients screened met entry criteria, with thrombocytopenia and leukopenia the most common reasons for exclusion. Fifteen patients were administered antiviral therapy; three patients in group A and six patients each in groups B and C. Loss of detectable HCV RNA was seen in 33% of patients, whereas 55% had a decrease in viral titers on therapy. Twenty-three adverse events occurred, including 20 serious adverse events. Thrombocytopenia was the most common adverse event. Two infectious complications occurred; one of these had a fatal outcome. We conclude that although pretransplantation antiviral therapy may reduce HCV titers in a minority of patients who meet treatment initiation criteria, adverse events associated with therapy are frequent and often severe in patients with Child's class B and C cirrhosis."

In 2012-2013, we designed a qualitative study to explore barriers to adherence in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We conducted six focus groups comprising 23 adults receiving treatment for either MDR-TB (n = 2) or XDR-TB (n = 21); 17 were on concurrent ART. Participants expressed a preference for ART over M/XDR-TB treatment as a result of greater tolerability, lower pill burden and a commitment to ART. Treatment outcomes and the social morbidity associated with M/XDR-TB, characterised by public notification, stigma and social isolation, were perceived to be worse than with HIV. Poor communication, low patient involvement and provider supervision of treatment exacerbated participants' negative experiences with TB care. To improve adherence, it is critical that new regimens for drug-resistant TB be developed with better efficacy, lower pill burden and fewer adverse effects. For the first time, such improved regimens are on the horizon. In parallel and equally important is the implementation of a cohesive approach that promotes patient involvement, empowerment and treatment literacy for HIV and for TB. "

Besides negatively affecting both patient and graft survival, HCV is associated with a heightened risk for new onset diabetes mellitus (NODM). The mechanisms underlying the diabetogenicity of HCV are complex but are likely to involve insulin resistance caused by inhibitory actions of the virus on insulin regulatory pathways in the liver. The resultant glucose dysregulation is an important determinant of increased morbidity and mortality in liver and kidney recipients. This review highlights the concerns for outcomes in HCV-positive liver and kidney transplant patients with particular focus on the interrelationship between hepatitis C and diabetes.

Treatment naive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients were randomized to receive either placebo or G-CSF (0.3 mg/ml, 3 times a week) for 12 weeks and HAART simultaneously. The trial was terminated prematurely after interim analysis performed because of a case of severe encephalopathia in the G-CSF group. At that point 11 HIV infected patients with a CD4+ T cell count < 350/mm3 had been randomized to the G-CSF group (n = 6) or placebo group (n = 5). In both groups plasma HIV RNA decreased significantly in response to HAART. However, plasma HIV RNA changed significantly different between the two groups with the decrease being less pronounced in the G-CSF group (P = 0.02). The concentrations of CD4+ memory T cells and CD8+ naive and memory T cells increased in response to HAART, and there was a trend towards more pronounced increases in several T-cell subpopulations in the G-CSF group. The CD56+ NK cells increased significantly more in the G-CSF group compared with placebo (P = 0. 000). All patients in the G-CSF group reported bone pain. The present data do not support simultaneous administration of G-CSF with initiation of HAART in treatment naive HIV infected patients."
16653,0.005,1.0000,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were examined from 7 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) who had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Samples were obtained both before and after 35-365 days of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). By polymerase chain reaction, JC virus (JCV) DNA was found in 6 of 7 patients at baseline but in only 1 patient after HAART. In contrast, in 25 historical control patients from whom sequential CSF specimens were obtained, no reversion from detectable to undetectable JCV DNA was observed. By use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, intrathecal production of antibody to JCV-VP1 was shown in only 1 of 4 HAART recipients at baseline but in 5 of 5 patients after treatment. The neuroradiological picture improved or had stabilized in all patients after 12 months of HAART, and all were alive after a median of 646 days (range, 505-775 days). Prolonged survival after HAART for PML is associated with JCV clearance from CSF. JCV-specific humoral intrathecal immunity may play a role in this response."
15767,0.005,1.0000,"The recombinant cytokines are increasingly important therapeutic agents for patients with AIDS. Recombinant interferon-alpha has demonstrated antitumor and antiretroviral activities in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma. Limited studies with interferon-beta suggest that it also has antitumor effects in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma, but interferon-gamma appears to be ineffective in controlling this tumor. The hematopoietic growth factors, including erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), have been evaluated in several populations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. The combination of G-CSF and recombinant human erythropoietin completely reversed the zidovudine-induced neutropenia of AIDS patients but was only partially effective in reversing anemia. In several clinical trials, GM-CSF induced marked increases in leukocyte counts and improved neutrophil function in some AIDS patients. In severely immunocompromised patients with disease caused by HIV who were receiving therapy with either G-CSF or GM-CSF, opportunistic infections continued to occur despite increases in circulating white blood cell counts. Recombinant cytokines may be used in the future in AIDS patients as adjunctive treatment with myelosuppressive antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs, as a possible means of enhancing host defense, or as agents of immune reconstitution."

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and urine from 52 AIDS patients suffering from various neurological diseases including 21 cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and PBMCs and urine from healthy subjects were evaluated by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of DNA belonging to the highly conserved large T antigen (LT) of JC virus. The different JC virus subtypes were identified by nucleotide sequence analysis of the virion protein (VP1) genomic region. JC virus DNA was detected in all the CSF samples from the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy patients, but not in the CSF from non-progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy cases, while the frequency of JC virus DNA detection in the PBMCs and urine did not differ among the three groups studied. JC virus type 2 was detected only in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy patients, and in particular in 52.4% of their CSF samples. Moreover, in the CSF of 19.0% of the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy cases, dual infection with both JC virus types 1 and 2 was found. The data obtained in this study indicate that the unexpected involvement of JC virus type 2, a strain not common in Italy, and the high frequency of dual infection with both JC virus types 1 and 2 in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy CSF, can be indications of risk factors for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy development."

Paired CSF and plasma specimens were drawn from 18 patients receiving HAART at baseline and after 9 to 70 months of therapy. At baseline, median HIV-1 RNA concentrations were 4.13 log10 copies/ml in CSF and 5.31 log10 copies/ml in plasma. At the time of on-therapy CSF sampling, HIV-1 RNA was undetectable in CSF from 13/18 patients (72%), and in plasma from 9/18 patients (50%). The genotypic analysis at baseline revealed reverse transcriptase (RT) resistance mutations in 7 of 11 (64%) CSF samples and in 8 of 11 (73%) plasma samples. No patient had protease resistance mutations, except for secondary mutations. At the time of virological failure in CSF, new RT and protease resistance mutations were found in both CSF and plasma of the two patients with both baseline and on-treatment paired evaluations. At long-term follow-up, the proportion of patients failing to respond virologically was lower in CSF than in plasma. Virological failure in CSF was associated with failure to respond in plasma and onset of new drug resistance mutations in both compartments."
9594,0.005,1.0000,"Syphilis is a frequent coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Whereas systemic syphilis infection increases plasma HIV RNA levels (viral load; VL), effects of syphilis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VL are unknown. We hypothesized that intrathecal immune activation in neurosyphilis would selectively increase CSF VL in coinfected patients. In this study, HIV-infected research subjects (N = 225) were categorized into three groups based on serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR), microhemaglutination for Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP) MHA-TP, and CSF VDRL: 23 with neurosyphilis (NS+; reactive serum RPR and MHA-TP and positive CSF VDRL); 42 with systemic syphilis but not neurosyphilis (Syph+; reactive serum RPR and MHA-TP; negative CSF VDRL), and 160 without syphilis (Syph-; nonreactive serum RPR). Plasma and CSF HIV VL were quantified by reverse transcriptase-ploymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Amplicor, Roche) in log(10) copies/ml. To adjust for covariates previously shown to influence CSF HIV VL (i.e., plasma VL, CD4, pleocytosis, and highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]), multivariable linear regression was used. Lumbar punctures (LP) done for research purposes diagnosed 23 with neurosyphilis; most (83%) of these reported prior syphilis treatment. Among subjects with detectable plasma VL, CSF VL was highest in NS+, followed by Syph+ and Syph- (P =.006). This relationship was independent of the level of plasma VL or CSF pleocytosis. By contrast, among subjects with undetectable plasma HIV VL, CSF VLs were similar in the three syphilis subgroups (P = .50). Neurosyphilis may amplify intrathecal HIV replication, possibly through immune activation that persists even after syphilis treatment. Because elevated CSF VL is associated with subsequent neurocognitive decline, future studies should evaluate the impact of neurosyphilis on the course of central nervous system (CNS) HIV infection."
14015,0.005,1.0000,"Cell-free mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a highly immunogenic molecule that is associated with several inflammatory conditions and with neurocognitive impairment during untreated HIV infection. Here, we investigate how cell-free mtDNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is associated with inflammation, neuronal damage, and neurocognitive functioning in the context of long-term suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). We quantified the levels of cell-free mtDNA in the CSF from 41 HIV-infected individuals with completely suppressed HIV RNA levels in blood plasma (<50 copies/mL) by droplet digital PCR. We measured soluble CD14, soluble CD163, interferon γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), neopterin, and neurofilament light chain (NFL) by immunoassays in CSF supernatant or blood plasma. Higher levels of mtDNA in CSF were associated with higher levels of MCP-1 (r = 0.56, p < 0.01) in CSF and TNF-α (r = 0.43, p < 0.01) and IL-8 (r = 0.44, p < 0.01) in blood plasma. Subjects with a previous diagnosis of AIDS showed significantly higher levels of mtDNA (p < 0.01) than subjects without AIDS. The associations between mtDNA and MCP-1 in CSF and TNF-α in blood remained significant after adjusting for previous diagnosis of AIDS (p < 0.01). Additionally, higher levels of mtDNA were associated with a lower CD4 nadir (r = -0.41, p < 0.01) and lower current CD4% (r = -0.34, p = 0.03). Paradoxically, higher levels of mtDNA in CSF were significantly associated with better neurocognitive performance (r = 0.43, p = 0.02) and with less neuronal damage (i.e. lower NFL). Higher cell-free mtDNA is associated with inflammation during treated HIV infection, but the impact on neurocognitive functioning and neuronal damage remains unclear and may differ in the setting of suppressive ART."

18860,0.005,1.0000,"HIV infection has experienced dramatic improvement in morbidity and mortality with the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This prompted a reevaluation of organ-solid transplantation as a treatment option for HIV-infected patients. Some trials in the United States have shown that one- and 2-year graft and patient survival is comparable to HIV-negative transplant population. In Europe the experience is still scarce. The aim of this study is to analyse the outcome and the clinical characteristics of HIV-infected patients who received kidney transplantation in Spain in the HAART era. Ten patients were transplanted in our country since 2001. Only one patient was black. The main cause of end-stage renal disease reported was glomerulonephritis. Six of the recipients were coinfected by hepatitis C virus. Inclusion criteria included undetectable HIV viral load and CD4 counts greater than 200/pL. Immunosuppression consisted of steroids, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, with antibody induction in 4 cases. The median and mean follow-up was 11 and 16.3+/-15.6 (3-46) months, respectively. One recipient lost his graft because of early renal venous thrombosis. The remaining patients are functioning graft with mean serum creatinina level of 1.5 +/- 0.5 mg/dl. Biopsy-proven acute rejection was diagnosed in 4 recipients and was reversed in all cases with antirejection treatment. The plasma HIV RNA levels have remained controlled and CD4 counts have been stable in excess of 200 cell/microL. None of patients have developed AIDS complications. Recipients receiving protease inhibitor-based HAART regimens required significant dosing modification to maintain appropriate tacrolimus levels. Our results show that renal transplantation can be a safe and effective treatment in select HIV-infected patients. Like other series, the acute rejection rate was higher than in non-HIV recipients. The reasons of this rejection incidence remain unknown."
12505,0.005,1.0000,"Because of the improvement in survival rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients after the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has become an important cause of morbidity. As the awareness of PAH has increased, it is more likely that this condition will be diagnosed more frequently and earlier in the course of the disease and HIV infection. The etiopathogenesis is not clear; no evidence of direct infection of the pulmonary vascular tree has been found and the current evidence seems to favor a role of dysregulated cytokine response to HIV infection. The pathological changes of plexiform arteriopathy are indistinguishable from the pathological changes of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Dyspnea is the most common presenting symptom. Echocardiography, though always not accurate in diagnosing PAH and estimating its severity, remains the main screening tool. Right heart catheterization is the gold standard investigation for diagnosis. New therapies like prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors have improved the outcome of patients with HIV-associated PAH. However, the overall prognosis of HIV-infected patients who develop PAH still remains poor."

For many investigators, retransplantation appears contraindicated because of constant recurrence and a high mortality. We report our experience in this setting. Between January 1985 and December 1995, 10 patients who underwent retransplantation for HBV graft reinfection were studied. According to the antiviral treatment administered after HBV recurrence on the first liver graft and the protocol of antiviral prophylaxis after retransplantation, two groups were defined: group 1 underwent retransplantation before January 1992 (n = 5), and group 2 underwent retransplantation after January 1992 (n = 5). At the time of reinfection, serum HBV DNA was positive in all patients, hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) was positive in 6 patients. Antiviral therapy was administered to 7 patients (group 1, adenine arabinoside mono phosphate [ara-Amp; n = 3]; group 2, ara-Amp [n = 5], ganciclovir [n = 4]). After retransplantation, long-term antibody to HB surface antigen (anti-HBs) immunoglobulins were administered to achieve an anti-HBs titer greater than 100 IU/L in group 1 and to achieve an anti-HBs titer greater than 500 IU/L associated with prophylactic intravenous ganciclovir administration (5 mg/kg three times weekly) for 2 years in group 2. In group 1, all patients died, either perioperatively or secondary to HBV recurrence (1 year survival, 0%). In group 2, 1 patient died 50 months after retransplantation of HBV cirrhosis on the second graft, and 4 patients remained HBsAg negative at a mean of 41 months (range, 24 to 68 months) after retransplantation.

Excess body fat may therefore exacerbate the bioenergetic dysfunction observed with HIV infection. To determine if body fat is associated with bioenergetic function in HIV, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 42 women with HIV who were virologically suppressed on antiretroviral therapy. Body composition was determined via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of monocytes was sorted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from participants in the fasting state. Differences in bioenergetic function, as measured by OCR, was assessed using Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman correlations adjusted for age, race, and smoking status. Participants were 86% Black, 45.5 years old, 48% current smokers, and 57% were obese (body mass index ≥30). Nearly all women (93%) had >30% total fat mass, while 12% had >50% total fat mass. Elevated levels of total fat mass, trunk fat, and leg fat were inversely correlated with measures of bioenergetic health as evidenced by lower maximal and reserve capacity OCR, and Bioenergetic Health Index. Measures of extracellular acidification (ECAR) in the absence (basal) or maximal (with oligomycin) were positively correlated with measures of bioenergetics, except proton leak, and were negatively correlated with fat mass. Despite virological suppression, women with HIV present with extremely high levels of adiposity that correlate with impaired bioenergetic health. Without effective interventions, this syndemic of HIV infection and obesity will likely have devastating consequences for our patients, potentially mediated through altered mitochondrial and glycolytic function."

We therefore analyzed the baseline characteristics of 2,472 HCV genotype 1-infected patients to identify correlations with gender, age, race, weight, body mass index (BMI), HCV acquisition mode, HCV subtype, alanine aminotransferase concentration, or histopathologic changes in the liver. After separation of the data according to four [HCV RNA](BL) groups (< or =5.0, >5.0 to 5.6, >5.6 to 5.9, and >5.9 log(10) IU/ml), we determined that increasing [HCV RNA](BL) correlated (P < 0.05) with increasing proportions of patients who were male, >40 years of age, or heavier (a weight of >85 kg or a BMI of >27 kg/m(2)). Histologic activity index (HAI) data were available for 1,304 of these patients: increasing [HCV RNA](BL) correlated with higher fibrosis and necrosis-inflammation scores. As a continuous variable, [HCV RNA](BL) correlated with age, gender, weight (continuous or < or =85 versus >85 kg), BMI (continuous or < or =27 versus >27 kg/m(2)), subtype, fibrosis score, and necrosis-inflammation score; however, multiple-regression analysis yielded P values of <0.1 only for age, gender, BMI (< or =27 versus >27 kg/m(2)), and fibrosis score.

To ascertain potential factors associated with differences in CD4 and CD8 cells among HIV negative women, we studied these cells in a group of 953 women, enrolled as HIV-negative comparators in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Using standard techniques, we measured CD4 and CD8 cells obtained during study-related visits every six months through visit 20 (maximum of 9.5 years). Results were correlated with demographic and behavioral factors, and data were analyzed using a multiple linear regression approach with generalized estimating equations. At baseline, the median age was 32.4 years, body mass index (BMI) was 26.4 kg/m(2), CD4 cell count was 1010 (range 214-2705)/microL, and CD8 cell count was 542 (range 72-2448)/microL. African-Americans comprised 54%, 24% were Hispanic, and 19% were Caucasian. In multivariate analysis, increasing age (p = 0.0006), increasing BMI (p = 0.001), and current smoking status (p = 0.03) were independent predictors of higher CD4 counts. Multivariate analyses of CD8 cells revealed that lower age (p = 0.001), higher BMI (p = 0.03), Hispanic race/ethnicity (p = 0.01); current smoking (p = 0.006), injection drug use (p = 0.02), and Hepatitis C infection (p = 0.01) were independent predictors of higher CD8 cell counts.

REE was measured using indirect calorimetry, and energy intake was recorded as a 3-day diary of food intake. REE (5,180+/-160 vs. 4,260+/-150 J/min, P<0.01) and also REE expressed per fat-free mass (86+/-1 vs. 78+/-2 J.kg fat-free mass-1.min-1, P<0.01) were significantly higher in the HAART+LD+ than the HAART+LD- group. Rate of lipid oxidation was significantly higher in the HAART+LD+ than the HAART+LD- group. Total energy and fat intakes were significantly increased in the HAART+LD+ compared with the HAART+LD- group.

To enhance lymphatic delivery of anti-HIV drugs, a novel drug delivery strategy was designed consisting of lipid-associated indinavir (50-80 nm in diameter) complexes in suspension for subcutaneous (SC) injection. Due to the pH-dependent lipophilicity of indinavir, practically all the drug molecules are incorporated into lipid phase when formulated at pH 7.4 and 5:1 lipid-to-drug (m/m) ratio. At pH 5.5, about 20% of drugs were found in lipid-drug complexes. Effects of lipid association on the time course of plasma indinavir concentrations were determined in macaques (Macaca nemestrina) administered with either soluble or lipid-associated formulation of indinavir (10 mg/kg, SC). Results yielded about a 10-fold reduction in peak plasma concentration and a 6-fold enhancement in terminal half-life (t1/2beta = 12 vs. 2 hours). In addition, indinavir concentrations in both peripheral and visceral lymph nodes were 250-2270% higher than plasma (compared with <35% with soluble lipid-free drug administration in humans). Administration of lipid-associated indinavir (20 mg/kg daily) to HIV-2287-infected macaques (at 30-33 weeks after infection) resulted in significantly reduced viral RNA load and increased CD4 T cell number concentrations. Collectively, these data indicate that lipid association greatly enhances delivery of the anti-HIV drug indinavir to lymph nodes at levels that cannot be achieved with soluble drug, provides significant virus load reduction, and could potentially reverse CD4 T cell depletion due to HIV infection."
6800,0.005,1.0000,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) upstream of IL28B predict the outcome of treatment in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but their impact on viral kinetics and relation to other predictors are not well known. Here, two SNPs, rs12979860 and rs8099917, were analysed and related to early viral kinetics during treatment in 110 patients with HCV genotype 1 infection. The reduction of HCV RNA after 7 days of therapy was more pronounced (P < 0.0001) in patients with CC(rs12979860) or TT(rs8099917) than in patients carrying TT(rs12979860) or GG(rs8099917), respectively. The two SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium (d' = 1, r2 = 0.44), but CC(rs12979860) was less common (43% vs. 71%) than TT(rs8099917). Patients carrying both CC(rs12979860) and TT(rs8099917) genotypes achieved lower levels of HCV RNA at week 4 than those with CT or TT at rs12979860 and TT(rs8099917) (P = 0.0004). The viral elimination was significantly influenced by rs12979860 independently of baseline viral load, age or fibrosis. This translated into high rates of sustained viral response (SVR) among patients carrying CC(rs12979860) despite the presence of high viral load at baseline (SVR 74%), high age (SVR 79%) or severe liver fibrosis (SVR 83%). We conclude that the IL28B variability influences the antiviral efficiency of interferon/ribavirin therapy and has a strong impact on SVR, independently of traditional response predictors. A combined assessment of these SNPs in conjunction with other response predictors may better predict outcome in difficult-to-treat patients."
4038,0.005,1.0000,"Defining the virus-host interactions responsible for HIV-1 transmission, including the phenotypic requirements of viruses capable of establishing de novo infections, could be important for AIDS vaccine development. Previous analyses have failed to identify phenotypic properties other than chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CD4+ T-cell tropism that are preferentially associated with viral transmission. However, most of these studies were limited to examining envelope (Env) function in the context of pseudoviruses. Here, we generated infectious molecular clones of transmitted founder (TF; n = 27) and chronic control (CC; n = 14) viruses of subtypes B (n = 18) and C (n = 23) and compared their phenotypic properties in assays specifically designed to probe the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection. We found that TF virions were 1.7-fold more infectious (P = 0.049) and contained 1.9-fold more Env per particle (P = 0.048) compared with CC viruses. TF viruses were also captured by monocyte-derived dendritic cells 1.7-fold more efficiently (P = 0.035) and more readily transferred to CD4+ T cells (P = 0.025). In primary CD4+ T cells, TF and CC viruses replicated with comparable kinetics; however, when propagated in the presence of IFN-α, TF viruses replicated to higher titers than CC viruses. This difference was significant for subtype B (P = 0.000013) but not subtype C (P = 0.53) viruses, possibly reflecting demographic differences of the respective patient cohorts. Together, these data indicate that TF viruses are enriched for higher Env content, enhanced cell-free infectivity, improved dendritic cell interaction, and relative IFN-α resistance. These viral properties, which likely act in concert, should be considered in the development and testing of AIDS vaccines."

8784,0.005,1.0000,"In patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, steatosis and fibrosis have been shown to be inversely associated with total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Steatosis and fibrosis have also been found to be associated with triglyceride (TG) levels; though, the direction of the relationship is inconsistent across studies. The objective of this study was to assess whether viral level and histological factors are associated with the serum lipid profile in a treatment-naïve cohort with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection. Participants were from the prospective Study of Viral Resistance to Antiviral Therapy (Virahep-C). Fasting lipid profiles were analysed for 160 African Americans and 170 Caucasian Americans. Linear regression was used to evaluate associations of each lipid with viral load and liver disease. TG levels were significantly and directly associated with HCV levels (P = 0.0034) and steatosis (P < 0.0001). Other lipid parameters were significantly lower in those with fibrosis [HDLc (P = 0.001) and TC levels (P = 0.004)] than in those without fibrosis. In patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, more severe liver disease was associated with lower lipid levels, with the exception of TG levels that were directly related to steatosis. The direct relationship between viral load and TG levels is consistent with proposed the mechanisms of very low density lipoprotein/HCV particle secretion. In contrast, the direct relationship between TG level and steatosis is inconsistent with posited mechanisms of HCV-induced steatosis, a possible reflection of HCV genotype 1 infection and a metabolic aetiology of steatosis."
12453,0.005,1.0000,"The immune response against HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection partly depends on chemokine-mediated recruitment of specific T cells. CXCL12 polymorphisms have been associated with AIDS progression and survival, but there are no data related to HCV infection. The aim of this study was to determine whether CXCL12 polymorphisms are related so as to achieve sustained virological response (SVR) after HCV therapy with pegylated-interferon-alpha/ribavirin (pegIFN-α/ribavirin) in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. We carried out a retrospective study in 319 naive patients who started HCV treatment. The CXCL12 (rs266093, rs1029153, and rs1801157) and IL28B (rs12980275) polymorphisms were genotyped by using the GoldenGate assay. Genetic data were analyzed under an additive inheritance model. The overall rates of the SVR were 54.9% (175/319) and 41.5% (90/217) in GT1/4 patients and 83.2% (84/101) in GT2/3 patients. Patients with a favorable CXCL12 rs1029153 T allele had higher SVR rates than patients with the rs1029153 CC genotype (44% CC, 49% CT, and 61.3% TT; p = 0.025). No significant results for the rs266093 and rs1801157 polymorphisms were found. Patients harboring the favorable rs1029153 T allele had significantly increased odds of achieving SVR [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.55; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.01; 2.40; p = 0.047]. Moreover, no significant association was found when the study population was stratified by HCV genotype (data not shown), possibly due to the low number of patients in each group. In conclusion, in this study we found that the favorable CXCL12 rs1029153 T allele seems to be related so as to achieve an SVR in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients on pegIFN-α/ribavirin therapy."

However, their roles in the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 6 remain undetermined. Sixty patients who were infected with HCV genotype 6 were commenced on 48 weeks of combination pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy. Response to therapy, profiles of haemoglobin changes and platelet counts during therapy and their associations with IL28B rs8099917 and ITPA rs1127354 polymorphisms were analysed. The overall sustained virologic response (SVR) rate was 91.7%. 18 patients (30.0%) required a reduction in ribavirin dosage. The distribution of IL28B rs8099917 TT/TG genotypes and ITPA rs1127354 CC/CA genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. IL28B rs8099917 TT genotype, when compared to TG genotype, was significantly associated with an increased SVR rate (96.2% and 62.5%, respectively) and was the only clinical parameter that predicted SVR (P = 0.014). The same significant association was observed when analysing allelic frequencies (T vs G, P = 0.001). ITPA rs1127354 CA genotype, when compared to CC genotype, was associated with lesser degree of anaemia throughout therapy (P < 0.05 for all time points). ITPA polymorphisms showed no association with changes in platelet count throughout therapy (P > 0.05 for all time points) and was not associated with SVR (P = 0.640). In chronic HCV genotype 6 infection, IL28B polymorphisms were associated with response to therapy. ITPA polymorphisms influenced the degree of anaemia but not thrombocytopenia during therapy."

Sequence analysis revealed the following results: (1) HBeAg to anti-HBe seroconversion was correlated roughly with the occurrence of precore-defective mutants, and several years appeared to be required for complete replacement of wild types by mutants; (2) core gene mutations preceded precore-defective mutations and tended to increase with time, although not cumulatively. They occurred not only during serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations but also after ALT returned to normal; (3) ALT fluctuations appeared to subside with complete replacement of the wild type by the mutant type and/or substantial accumulation of core gene mutations; (4) unexpectedly, the anti-HBe-positive ""healthy"" carrier was found to harbor the wild type precore gene, as did the HBeAg-positive ""healthy"" carrier; however, the core gene of the former evolved at a rapid rate; and (5) a partial deletion was recognized in the core gene at the onset of fatal hepatic failure in one patient. Thus, the precore/core mutation was closely related with the clinical features in the patients."
1339,0.005,1.0000,"Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV)-resistant mutations have been identified in treating hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. This study aimed to analyze the response, the incidence of ADV resistance and the virologic characteristics of ADV therapy. A total of 29 CHB patients with confirmed lamivudine (LAM)-resistant HBV were treated with ADV for more than 52 weeks. Serum HBV DNA, HBV genotypes and sequences of HBV polymerase reverse-transcriptase domain were determined. Rates for the biochemical response, HBeAg loss, HBeAg seroconversion and virologic response (< 200 copies/mL of HBV DNA) were 82.8, 23.5, 11.8, and 48.3%, respectively, at week 52 of treatment. Lower pre-treatment mean HBV DNA level was the only significant factor associated with negative HBV DNA after ADV therapy. Six (20.7%) patients had clearance of LAM-resistant YMDD variants with replacement by the wild type HBV at week 52. The rtN236T, rtA181V/T and rtI233V were not identified before ADV therapy and the genotypic mutation of rtN236T was detected in one (3.4%) patient. In conclusion, the 52-week ADV treatment for patients with LAM-resistant HBV variants significantly achieved normalization of ALT levels, reduced serum HBV DNA levels and induced HBeAg loss and seroconversion. The emergence of ADV-resistant mutations seemed rare at weeks 52."
13107,0.005,1.0000,"In successful antiviral therapy of hepatitis B, drug combinations, particularly combinations without cross-resistance, can delay or prevent the emergence of drug-resistant mutants. Because drug-resistant mutants are archived and may limit future therapeutic options, prevention is important for long-term therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, combining drugs may achieve synergistic or additive antiviral effects compared with single drug therapy. Undesirable aspects of combination therapy include higher treatment costs and possibly lower adherence rates (due to pill number or complexity of regimen). Potentially harmful effects of combination therapy include higher rates of side effects, reduced efficacy due to drug competition, and the risk of multidrug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) if combination therapy is insufficient to prevent resistance. Combination therapy has been shown to reduce the rate of drug resistance in chronic hepatitis B, but only when drugs with a low barrier to resistance are used (lamivudine, adefovir). Combination therapies may achieve greater degrees of HBV DNA suppression, but this has not been associated with higher rates of seroconversion (hepatitis B e antigen or hepatitis B surface antigen) compared to single drug therapy. The benefit of combination therapy has yet to be demonstrated with agents that are associated with a high barrier to resistance (tenofovir, entecavir). The use of combination therapy is recommended in specific patient groups: those with decompensated cirrhosis, those coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus and HBV who are on antiretroviral therapy, those who have undergone liver transplantation, and those with drug-resistant HBV infection. There is insufficient evidence to recommend combination therapy as first-line therapy for all patients with chronic hepatitis B."
10877,0.005,1.0000,"Twenty-two vertically human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected Brazilian children were studied for antiretroviral drug resistance. They were separated into 2 groups according to the administration of antiretroviral therapy into those who presented disease symptoms or without symptoms and no therapy. Viral genome sequencing reactions were loaded on an automated DNA sampler (TruGene, Visible Genetics) and compared to a database of wild type HIV-1. In the former group 8 of 12 children presented isolates with mutations conferring resistance to protease inhibitors (PIs), 7 presented isolates resistant to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and 2 presented isolates resistant to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Ten children were included in the antiretroviral na ve group. Eight were susceptible to NRTIs and all of them were susceptible to PIs; one presented the V108I mutation, which confers low-level resistance to NNRTIs. The data report HIV mutant isolates both in treated and untreated infants. However, the frequency and the level of drug resistance were more frequent in the group receiving antiretroviral therapy, corroborating the concept of selective pressure acting on the emergence of resistant viral strains. The children who presented alterations at polymorphism sites should be monitored for the development of additional mutations occurring at relevant resistance codons."

This review details recent developments in understanding the role of vitamin D in immunity, the antibacterial actions of vitamin D, the association between vitamin D deficiency and common infections (like sepsis, pneumonia, influenza, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV)), potential therapeutic implications for vitamin D replacement, and future research directions."
78,0.005,1.0000,"The emergence of antiretroviral (ARV) drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) quasispecies is a major cause of treatment failure. These variants are usually replaced by drug-sensitive ones when the selective pressure of the drugs is removed, as the former have reduced fitness in a drug-free environment. This was the rationale for the design of structured ARV treatment interruption (STI) studies for the management of HIV-1 patients with treatment failure. We have studied the origin of drug-sensitive HIV-1 quasispecies emerging after STI in patients with treatment failure due to ARV drug resistance. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples were obtained the day of treatment interruption (day 0) and 30 and 60 days afterwards. HIV-1 pol and env were partially amplified, cloned, and sequenced. At day 60 drug-resistant variants were replaced by completely or partially sensitive quasispecies. Phylogenetic analyses of pol revealed that drug-sensitive variants emerging after STI were not related to their immediate temporal ancestors but formed a separate cluster, demonstrating that STI leads to the recrudescence and reemergence of a sequestrated viral population rather than leading to the back mutation of drug-resistant forms. No evidence for concomitant changes in viral tropism was seen, as deduced from env sequences. This study demonstrates the important role that the reemergence of quasispecies plays in HIV-1 population dynamics and points out the difficulties that may be found when recycling ARV therapies with patients with treatment failure."
3887,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) primarily infects CD4+ lymphocytes and macrophages and causes AIDS in humans. Retroviral vectors allowing neomycin phosphotransferase (npt) gene expression were engineered to express 5' sequences of HIV-1 RNA in the antisense or sense orientation and used to transform the human CD4+ lymphocyte-derived MT4 cell line. Cells expressing antisense or sense RNA to the HIV-1 tat mRNA leader sequence, as part of the 3' untranslated region of the npt mRNA, remained sensitive to HIV-1 infection. In contrast, resistance to HIV-1 infection was observed in cells expressing antisense RNA to the HIV-1 primer-binding site or to the region 5' to the primer-binding site as part of the 3' region of the npt mRNA. Cells expressing the tat mRNA leader sequence in the sense orientation as a precise replacement of the 5' untranslated region of npt mRNA were also resistant to HIV-1. These results indicate that sense and antisense approaches can be used to interfere with HIV-1 multiplication."
14232,0.005,1.0000,"With the approval in 2007 of the first integrase inhibitor (INI), raltegravir, clinicians became better able to suppress virus replication in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) who were harboring many of the most highly drug-resistant viruses. Raltegravir also provided clinicians with additional options for first-line therapy and for the simplification of regimens in patients with stable virological suppression. Two additional INIs in advanced clinical development-elvitegravir and S/GSK1349572-may prove equally versatile. However, the INIs have a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance in that 1 or 2 mutations are capable of causing marked reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir and elvitegravir, the most well-studied INIs. This perspective reviews the genetic mechanisms of INI resistance and their implications for initial INI therapy, the treatment of antiretroviral-experienced patients, and regimen simplification."
18269,0.005,1.0000,"Resistance to antiretroviral agents, and in particular the increasing levels of transmitted resistant virus could offset the substantial gains won with potent antiretroviral therapy. Primary and acquired antiretroviral resistance rates reflect the relative usage of different antiretroviral drugs in the population, as well as the inherent genetic barrier to the development of resistance associated with individual drugs. Data on antiretroviral resistance rates, gleaned from the growing HIV-1-infected population treated with a continuously increasing number of antiretroviral drugs and drug combinations, provide insights into patient management approaches for delaying the emergence of resistance and minimizing the degree of resistance. Evolving data suggest that the relative ease by which HIV-1 escapes the selective pressure of chronic drug exposure varies for the different antiretroviral drug classes and individual antiretroviral drugs. The development of resistance in vivo can be anticipated based on these data, in conjunction with the individuals treatment history and resistance testing results. These in turn can guide the judicious use of antiretroviral drugs to attain optimal treatment responses and to preserve therapeutic options for the time when antiretroviral-resistant strains emerge. The recent developments of new antiretroviral drugs, including the use of boosted protease inhibitors, suggest that treatment strategies can limit the development of resistance."

Gonorrhoea, chancroid, syphilis seroactivity, trichomoniasis, or objective signs of STD were found in 78%, and HIV seropositivity in 15% of men and 19% of women. Most women were married, living with a spouse; while most men were single, or married, but living separated from a spouse. Among married men, last sex was with a female sex worker (FSW) or casual partner for 60% not living with a spouse and 26% living with a spouse (P<0.005). Two or more partners during the past year were reported by 82% of men and 25% of women (P <0.001), and 55% of men and 11% of women reported the last partner was high risk. HIV seropositivity among both genders was associated with numbers of partners, and among women, with being widowed or divorced. Only 3% reported use of a condom with the last partner. Among men whose last sex was with a FSW, 74% said the reason for not using a condom was not having one. Thus, infrequent condom use, low condom availability, and gender differences in behaviour necessitate modifying development policies that separate families; and better coordination between family planning, PHC, and AIDS/STD programmes, with improved supply, social marketing and community-based distribution of condoms in high-risk settings for STD/HIV prevention."

11697,0.005,1.0000,"The importance of antiretroviral therapy adherence for patients living with HIV/AIDS has been well documented. Despite this critical need, many do not follow prescribed regimens. To examine the barriers that lead to non-adherence, we used cross-sectional survey data from a randomized controlled intervention trial in northern and north-eastern Thailand. Of the 507 patients that were enrolled in the trial, we analyzed 386 patients on antiretroviral therapy in order to examine the barriers to adherence. In addition to demographic characteristics, depressive symptoms, physical health, access to care, social support, and internalized shame, HIV disclosure and family communication were examined. The correlation analysis revealed that adherence is significantly associated with internalized shame, access to care, depressive symptoms, and family communication. Based on the multiple logistic regression analysis, depressive symptoms, access to care, HIV disclosure, and family communication were significant predictors of adherence. Having depressive symptoms remains a significant barrier to adherence, while access to care, HIV disclosure, and family communication play important positive roles. Our findings underscore the critical importance of addressing these various challenges that can influence adherence to antiretroviral therapy."

Patients were classified from stages 1-6 according to the immunological criteria of the Walter Reed staging system. Statistical analysis of psychometric data showed an effect of the stage of the disease on test performances, indicating a decline in attention, accumulation of perceptual interferences, decline in visuoperceptual speed and visuomotor response speed and reduced verbal memory performance, especially in stage 6 patients. Comparison of performance levels with normative test data already revealed cognitive deficits in about 20-30% of the patients in stages 2-5. As regards verbal memory, especially learning and recognition of new verbal information were impaired. In contrast, there was no significant deficit for nonverbal memory processing. Compared with the controls, patients exhibited an increasing number of abnormal EEG findings in stages 2-6. As a conclusion, in the stages before acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) develops, EEG findings as well as psychometric findings indicate central nervous system involvement of AIDS in about 20-30% of cases, whereas in full-blown AIDS there is a marked increase to 80%. Besides a more general deficit of attention and psychomotor speed as is seen in subcortical dementia, there is evidence for a particular verbal learning disorder, suggesting additional selective impairment of the brain."

In a sample of patients who had been prescribed protease inhibitors for the first time, the authors tested to see whether there was a minimal duration of CD4+ cell count increase before the increase had an impact on the occurrence of opportunistic infections. The evolution (difference between time t and baseline) of CD4+ cell count was modeled using a mixed effects linear model. Changes in CD4+ count estimated by this model were then included as time-dependent covariates in a proportional hazards model. Finally, the authors tested for the existence of a CD4+ change x time interaction. The authors used a sample of 553 French patients first prescribed protease inhibitors in 1996 and followed for a median of 16 months. During the first 120 days, there was no association between CD4+ change and the rate of opportunistic infections. After 120 days, each 50-cell/mm3 increase in CD4+ count was associated with a 60% (95% confidence interval: 45, 72) reduction in the incidence of opportunistic infections. These results, based on modeling of CD4+ cell response, at least indirectly reinforce the concept of a delayed but possible immune recovery with the use of protease inhibitors. The findings support the potential for interruption of certain types of prophylaxis against opportunistic infections under reasonable conditions of duration of antiretroviral therapy and sustained CD4+ cell response."

Similar declines were also noted in the number of new cases of biopsy-confirmed KS and primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. In contrast, there was no decrease in the number of first admissions for patients with HIV infection and other cancers not typically associated with HIV infection.

Via immunostaining, HBcAg was first observed in the nucleus of hepatocytes approximately 3 days after infection. A maximal percentage of HBcAg positive cells in 0.1% of cultured hepatocytes was detected on the 7th day. HBsAg was also first demonstrated on the 3rd day, and predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. About 5% of hepatocytes were HBsAg positive on the 12th day after infection. The percentage of positive cells did not appear to increase after this time. Using in situ cytohybridization and agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blot analysis, HBV DNA was first detected on the 4th day. In addition, electron microscopic studies revealed the presence of 42 nm virus-like particles in the cytoplasm of infected cells in the second week after infection. This in vitro system provides a model for studying the mechanism of HBV infection, viral replication and maturation. However, further improvement of culture systems is needed, to increase the number of infected cells and for active HBV replication."

Most patients responded to HAART [during the first 6 months, plasma HIV VL fell by a mean 1.39 log10, becoming undetectable (<400 copies/ml) in 22% and CD4+ T cells increased by a mean of 100 cells/microl], but surprisingly, 27 (54%) showed some rise and 25 (50%) showed a significant increase in the HCV VL. This figure was considered to be a minimum estimate. A majority of the patients showed an increase of less than 1 log10 that was associated with a rapid decrease in the HIV VL, whereas an increase in the HCV VL of greater than 1 log10, noted in eight patients, was associated with a baseline CD4+ cell count of less than 200 cells/microl. The increase in the HCV VL was not associated with hepatitis as determined by raised alanine transferase."
19798,0.005,1.0000,"To our knowledge, an association between human immunodeficiency virus infection and pseudo-Cushing's syndrome has not previously been described. We describe four HIV-infected patients with pseudo-Cushing's syndrome, characterized by striking dorsocervical and submandibular fat accumulation and central obesity. In each case, cortisol levels were either normal or suppressed adequately with administration of dexamethasone, excluding the diagnosis of true Cushing's syndrome. Immune function and weight improved significantly preceding the development of pseudo-Cushing's syndrome. Three of the four patients were taking a common protease inhibitor at the onset of symptoms, and the fourth reported the exacerbation of his symptoms with the addition of a protease inhibitor. The observed characteristic pattern of fat deposition may be attributable to a specific effect of new antiretroviral therapies or may relate to recovery independent of medication usage. Distinguishing between pseudo-Cushing's syndrome and true Cushing's syndrome is critical for preventing the unnecessary and potentially harmful treatment of such patients. Further research into the mechanisms of this novel phenomenon is needed."
19041,0.005,1.0000,"In 2014, there were 36.9 million people worldwide living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH), of whom 17.1 million did not know they were infected. Whilst the number of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections has declined globally since 2000, there are still regions where new infection rates are rising, and diagnosing HIV early in the course of infection remains a challenge. Late presentation to care in HIV refers to individuals newly presenting for HIV care with a CD4 count below 350 cells/µl or with an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining event. Late presentation is associated with increased patient morbidity and mortality, healthcare costs and risk of onward transmission by individuals unaware of their status. Further, late presentation limits the effectiveness of all subsequent steps in the cascade of HIV care. Recent figures from 34 countries in Europe show that late presentation occurs in 38.3% to 49.8% of patients newly presenting for care, depending on region. In Switzerland, data from patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study put the rate of late presentation at 49.8% and show that patients outside established HIV risk groups are most likely to be late presenters. Provider-initiated testing needs to be improved to reach these groups, which include heterosexual men and women and older patients. The aim of this review is to describe the scale and implications of late presentation using cohort data from Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe, and to highlight initiatives to improve early HIV diagnosis. The importance of recognising indicator conditions and the potential for missed opportunities for HIV testing is illustrated in three clinical case studies. "
1761,0.005,1.0000,"Management of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) improved dramatically during the 1990s. The advent of high-performance quantitative HIV assays and highly active antiretroviral therapy were the two most important developments in HIV medicine. As a result, HIV mortality and morbidity have reduced significantly, although a proportion of HIV-infected patients are still diagnosed late. Management of HIV during pregnancy has also improved so that vertical transmission is now limited to less than 2% of all cases. Knowledge of the different stages of HIV infection enables optimal timing of start of antiretroviral therapy. Routine offering of HIV testing might also reduce the number of patients diagnosed with immunodeficiency. Better knowledge of the life cycle of HIV has made it possible to design new classes of antiretroviral drugs. The new drugs, however, pose new challenges as they might have long-term side effects. In addition, their interactions with other antiretroviral drugs might not be favourable."
4605,0.005,1.0000,"Improvements in the treatment of HIV infection and in the advancement of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) have led to an increase in the number of individuals with HIV who are surviving to an older age. Preventing the development of neurocognitive abnormalities has become an increasingly important issue in this aging patient population, which is already at risk for cognitive impairment as a result of the neuropathological effects of HIV. cART has been critical in reducing the overall severity of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), but numerous challenges remain, as the prevalence of HAND continues to be high. There are several key areas in which treatment could be improved to reduce the incidence and severity of HAND. The use of well-tolerated cART medications that are able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier hold particular promise, as these agents may enable increased viral suppression in the parenchyma and may reduce neurocognitive dysfunction. In addition, the improved treatment of comorbid medical conditions that are common in patient populations with HIV (eg, HCV, liver failure and metabolic syndrome) is critical, as several of these conditions are known to have a significant effect on neural functions. Various research approaches indicate that the development of agents that control free radicals, neurotoxicity, proinflammatory processes and apoptosis may also have substantial potential in this field."

For those infected, social support is associated with improved medication adherence. Disclosure of infection status is likely a prerequisite for social support. However, little research describes patterns of HIV disclosure by infected persons. We retrospectively evaluated factors associated with disclosure among patients initiating HIV care at a university-based clinic from 2007 to 2012. Of 490 persons initiating care, 13 % had not disclosed their HIV infection to anyone. Black race significantly predicted non-disclosure and persons living with a significant other or friends were more likely to have disclosed their HIV infection versus those living alone. CD4 + T lymphocyte count <200 was associated with nondisclosure and disclosure only to family members. Future research is needed to better understand factors associated with disclosure of HIV infection status, because this could enhance receipt of social support and contribute to improved HIV health outcomes."

In 2004, a new humanised mouse model was reported. It was based on the intrahepatic injection of human CD34+ cord blood cells into newborn, highly immunodeficient mice. These mice develop a lymphoid system of human origin and are highly susceptible to HIV infection and showed disseminated infection, persistent viraemia and characteristic helper CD4+ T-cell loss. Here, we will briefly review the various existing humanised mouse models and highlight their value to the study of HIV infection."
14754,0.005,1.0000,"A small number of UK nationals who have a low, unrecognised or unacknowledged risk for HIV present late in the course of HIV infection; often after frequent attendances to primary care physicians. Information from in-depth interviews with individuals diagnosed with HIV in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (EW&NI) was analysed. Those diagnosed because of HIV-related symptoms (late diagnoses) were compared with those diagnosed for other reasons. Of the 286 individuals interviewed, 157 (55%) had HIV-related symptoms at the time of diagnosis, and 129 were tested for other reasons. A greater proportion of those diagnosed late were male and older. Of the 157 late diagnoses, 77 were considered to have acquired HIV heterosexually in the UK, 19 heterosexually abroad, 16 through 'high-risk' behaviours, 15 heterosexually by a 'high-risk' partner, four through blood transfusion and the remainder through an unusual or unknown route. A significantly higher proportion of those diagnosed late had had a long-standing relationship. None had been informed by a current or ex-partner of their HIV status. Primary care physicians should consider HIV as a possibility when patients without an apparent risk for HIV-infection present with symptoms indicative of possible immune suppression. Sensitive partner notification practices that enable a greater number of individuals to inform their partners should be explored."
19129,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B is a well known problem in dialysis units. We therefore examined the historical frequency of hepatitis B carriers in our unit, our vaccination program to hepatitis B virus (HBV), the response to hepatitis B vaccine, the IgG subclass response of anti-HBs and the response and IgG subclass response to pneumococcal vaccination (another vaccine) in dialysis patients. From 1970 and onwards 23 HBV carriers were found, but no new cases of hepatitis B occurred during the study period, i.e. from 1980 and onwards. Only one of the carriers was alive by the end of 2001. In four patients liver disease (in one of them liver cirrhosis) may have been a concomitant cause of death. The antibody response to hepatitis B vaccine was significantly lower in patients than in staff. In four patients a fourth injection was cancelled due to transplantation and bad health, while such data were lacking in 8 cases. In anti-HBs positive patients and controls a significant difference in the response of healthy adults was observed in anti-HBs IgG1 (p < 0.001) vs all other IgG subclasses. Dialysis patients had low levels, or negative findings, in all cases, with IgG1 as the highest proportion found (3/11 patients). An antibody response to pneumococcal vaccination was registered in 25 out of 29 dialysis patients (in all 86%). The IgG-subclass vaccination response to pneumococci in 28 dialysis patients was mainly IgG2 and IgG1 but also occurred in IgG3 and IgG4. Prevaccination antibody levels of the controls were higher in IgG1 and IgG2 (p < 0.01) (n = 21) than in dialysis patients (n = 28). Hepatitis B is nowadays a rare, but still dangerous disease in nephrology units. Dialysis patients have a reduced response to hepatitis B vaccine and vaccination schedules should be started early as some patients otherwise may not receive a fourth injection. The adequate antibody response to pneumococcal vaccination mainly due to IgG2 and IgG1 antibodies indicates that the antigen involved is important in vaccination responses in dialysis patients."
9911,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem, common worldwide, leading to acute and chronic hepatitis and its consequences of hepatocirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients on hemodialysis belong to the high-risk group of HCV infection. The prevalence of HCV infection in dialysis patients ranges from 4% to more than 70% in some countries. The main reasons for such a high incidence of infections are a high prevalence of HCV infection in the general population, lack of standard infection precautions and effective vaccination, inadequate disinfection procedures of dialysis machines and other medical equipment, as well as spread of infection from patient to patient, especially in dialytic centers with a high percentage of infected patients. The diagnostic procedures useful in the evaluation of HCV infection are detection of anti-HCV antibodies, identification of HCV RNA, counts of virus copies, and identification of its genome. From the 6 major genotypes and multiple subtypes of the HCV, genotypes 1a and 1b are the most common in Europe and Japan, and 1b is responsible for more severe liver disease and aggressive course leading to liver fibrosis. Antiviral therapy of HCV+ dialysis patients with interferon-alpha (INF-alpha) gives slightly better results than in the general population, but is poorly tolerated and associated with side effects. Although ribavirin in not recommended for dialysis patients, the addition of small doses of this compound to pegylated INF is discussed, especially for patients in whom previous infection treatment failed."
15583,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important global health problem. The prevalence of HCV is significantly higher in haemodialysis and kidney transplant patients, as compared to the general population. In spite of the relatively milder liver disease activity reported in HCV-infected haemodialysis patients, HCV infection adversely affects survival. Likewise, HCV has a detrimental effect on both patient and graft survival after kidney transplantation. However, patient survival is significantly better with kidney transplantation compared to remaining on dialysis; therefore, HCV infection alone should not be a contraindication to transplantation. Combination antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha and low-dose ribavirin is currently evolving in haemodialysis patients. Interferon-alpha (standard/pegylated) is relatively contraindicated after kidney transplantation because of an increased risk of allograft rejection. Therefore, antiviral treatment of transplant candidates while on dialysis remains the best option and may avoid the risk of HCV-associated liver and renal disease after transplantation. Large multi-centre clinical trials are required in HCV-infected haemodialysis and kidney transplant patients in order to define optimal therapeutic strategies before and after transplantation."

The aims of the present review are to discuss issues that are unique to HIV infection and end-stage renal disease, and to provide dialysis caretakers with sufficient information to help them optimize care and improve outcomes of these patients. Issues related to the choice of renal replacement therapy, vascular access, management of anemia, vaccination, and antiretroviral therapies are discussed in detail."
2401,0.005,1.0000,"The development of highly active antiretroviral therapy has improved life expectancy and reduced progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. However, resistance to currently available classes of antiretroviral drugs has become a problem, limiting the options for patients with advanced disease who have been heavily treated. Enfuvirtide (T-20; ENF), a synthetic peptide, is the first of a new class of antiretrovirals that block entry of virus into host cells. ENF interferes with conformational changes required for membrane fusion and injection of virus into the host cell. Optimal treatment of HIV infection will likely require combinations of drugs that target novel stages of HIV type 1 entry and replication."

Before the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy, acute kidney injury in HIV-positive patients was most commonly the result of volume depletion, septicemia, or nephrotoxic medications. Acute kidney injury remains a significant problem in the antiretroviral era, and still commonly is attributed to infection or nephrotoxic medications. Less common causes such as direct infectious insults, immune restoration inflammatory syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and obstruction should be considered when the underlying process is not obvious. In addition to advanced HIV disease, several other patient characteristics have emerged as potential risk factors for acute kidney injury in the antiretroviral era, including older age, diabetes, pre-existing chronic kidney disease, and hepatitis co-infection or liver disease."

HIV infection can cause end-stage renal disease (ESRD) through both HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) and antiretroviral drug toxicity. Until recently, chronic dialysis (HD or PD) was the only form of treatment available for these patients. Kidney transplantation is an alternative method to dialysis and improve the quality of life in HIV-positive ESRD patients.

7470,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been recognized as an emerging problem in dialysis patients and its prevalence varies considerably among different areas of the world. The prevalence of HCV infection in hemodialysis (HD) patients and its associated risk factors is not well documented in our country. We therefore performed this study aiming to discuss prevention of further transmission of HCV infection among our patients. Between September 2003 and September 2005, 169 patients with end-stage renal failure on HD at the Renal Transplant Center, Medical City Teaching Hospital, Baghdad, were involved in this prospective study. There were 102 (60.4%) males, and 67 (39.6%) females, with age ranging from 14-67 years. Anti-HCV antibodies were positive in 12 of these patients (7.1%). Female gender, age >or = 60 years, dialysis duration < or = six months, history of having received blood transfusion(s), and < 9 hours per week of HD were significant predictors of anti-HCV positivity. We conclude that adherence to universal infection precautions, regular HCV screening of transfusions and of patients on HD and the use of separate machines for those who are anti-HCV positive, are important factors. To further reduce the prevalence in our patients, erythropoietin should replace blood transfusions as also testing for HCV RNA using polymerase chain reaction before starting HD."
9139,0.005,1.0000,"We report the case of a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who developed nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal failure mimicking human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) who required initiation of hemodialysis and was found on renal biopsy to have membranous nephropathy. Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative. Although she required hemodialysis, she was treated with prednisone and experienced a progressive decline in her serum creatinine from 10.1 mg/dL to 1.9 mg/dL, which permitted the discontinuation of hemodialysis. After she abruptly discontinued prednisone, her creatinine level increased to 4.8 mg/dL, and she experienced marked worsening of her nephrotic syndrome. Resumption of prednisone resulted in normalization of serum creatinine and reduction in urine protein excretion. No adverse effects of prednisone occurred during this time. She remains off of hemodialysis for 1 year with a serum creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL and urine protein excretion of 0.4 g/d. Although most patients with HIV infection, nephrotic-range proteinuria, and renal failure have FSGS, a minority may have membranous nephropathy. Although typically not a steroid-responsive lesion in the setting of advanced renal failure, membranous nephropathy may be a highly steroid-responsive lesion in the HIV-infected patient, and treatment may help avert the need for dialysis in a patient population that generally has a poor outcome on dialysis."
7824,0.005,1.0000,"It has been demonstrated that sustained virological response (SVR) in patients with chronic hepatitis C indicates resolution of infection. We describe a late hepatitis C virus (HCV) relapse with nearly identical HCV genotype 1a RNA, 14 months after a SVR achievement following a 12-month pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin treatment in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patient. This virological relapse occurred concomitantly with interruption of highly active antiretroviral therapy and subsequent increased immunosuppression. HCV retreatment was successful and HCV RNA was undetectable at 50 months of follow-up. This case suggests that late relapse of HCV infection in HIV-positive patients with SVR is possible in case of increased immunodeficiency related to highly active antiretroviral therapy interruption. In such circumstances, a close monitoring of HCV viremia and aminotransferases should be performed. "
12393,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment of serum precipitates with sodium thiocyanate in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication results in liberation of circulating hepatitis core antigen (HBcAg) which can be demonstrated radioimmunologically. Follow-up investigations were performed in 80 patients with acute hepatitis B. Sera were examined for HBcAg. HBV DNA and conventional HBV markers. At the time of admission to hospital 34 of 80 (42%) patients were HBeAg positive. Twenty-six (76%) of the 34 HBcAg positive patients were HBV DNA positive, and circulating HBcAg was detectable in 25 of 34 (73%) HBcAg positive cases. In patients with uncomplicated courses of acute hepatitis B the serological HBcAg assay and HBV DNA became negative 1 to 8 weeks before elimination of HBeAg and up to 12 weeks earlier than the sera became negative for HBsAg. Five patients (6%) showed transition to chronic hepatitis B with persistence of HBsAg, HBeAg, HBV DNA and HBcAg in serum. One patient with acute hepatitis B and development of chronic hepatitis suffered from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and showed delayed formation of anti-HBc. In this case uncomplexed HBcAg was demonstrable during the acute phase of hepatitis B. With the appearance of anti-HBc HBcAg circulated in a complexed form. The data indicate that serological determinations of HBcAg and HBV DNA can serve as prognostic markers in the early phase of acute hepatitis B. The demonstration of uncomplexed HBcAg in serum of a patient with inadequate formation of anti-HBc supports the hypothesis that circulating HBcAg is usually complexed by specific antibodies."
17561,0.005,1.0000,"One of the most controversial topics in the medical management of HIV disease is the optimal time to initiate highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-1-infected adults. Premature exposure to antiretrovirals may precipitate early evolution of resistance and unnecessary side-effects, whereas remaining off HAART until late in the course of HIV disease may lead to reduced therapeutic benefits and elevated mortality. The lack of a randomised clinical trial to consider this issue has resulted in ongoing revision of expert recommendations and substantial variability between international consensus guidelines regarding the optimal time to initiate therapy. Since this uncertainty is a source of unease for both patients and clinicians, we summarise the latest evidence regarding the optimal time to initiate HAART with consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks of starting HIV treatment at the different levels presently recommended in leading consensus guidelines."

Many reports have speculated on the possible linkage between these two conditions, yet never before data driven from a large national database was utilized in order to investigate this issue. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between SLE and hepatitis B carrier state. Patients with SLE were compared with age- and sex-matched controls regarding the proportion of hepatitis B carrier state in a case-control study. Chi-square and t tests were used for univariate analysis, and a logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. The study was performed utilizing the medical database of Clalit Health Services. The study included 5018 lupus patients over the age of 20 years and 25,090 age- and sex-frequency-matched controls without SLE. The proportion of hepatitis B carriers was higher in SLE patients as compared to controls (0.9 and 0.56 %, respectively; p < 0.001). A significant association was also observed among patients in lower socioeconomic status. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, SLE was significantly associated with hepatitis B (OR = 1.828, 95 % CI = 1.291-2.590). Patients with SLE have a greater proportion of hepatitis B carrier state than matched controls."

Physical examination, serum liver enzyme tests, and hepatitis B virus marker tests were performed at least every 3 months. We reviewed medical records and performed medical interviews regarding to patients' adherence to medication. Adherence rates <90% were defined as poor adherence in the present study. Cumulative viral breakthrough rates were lower in the ETV-treated patients than in the LAM-treated patients (P<0.001). Seven ETV-treated (5.1%) and 6 LAM-treated patients (8.8%) revealed poor adherence to medication (P=0.48). Among ETV-treated patients, 4 (3.1%) of 128 patients without poor adherence experienced viral breakthrough and 3 (42.8%) of 7 patients with poor adherence experienced viral breakthrough (P<0.001). Only 3 of 38 (7.8%) LAM-treated patients with viral breakthrough had poor adherence, a lower rate than the ETV-treated patients (P=0.039). Nucleoside analogue resistance mutations were observed in 50.0% of ETV- and 94.1% of LAM-treated patients with viral breakthrough (P=0.047). Viral breakthrough associated with poor adherence could be a more important issue in the treatment with especially stronger NAs, such as ETV."
5213,0.005,1.0000,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients co-infected with HIV. Co-infection results in increased HCV replication and more rapid rates of liver disease progression. The effect of HIV combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) on HCV replication has not been studied in depth. To address this issue, we enrolled a small cohort of HCV/HIV co-infected patients into a cART initiation trial and used dynamic modeling combined with evaluation of immune responses and microarray profiles to determine how effective treatment of HIV affects HCV. Treatment with cART resulted in increased HCV replication and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in a subset of patients. Subjects with evidence of hepatic injury (increased ALT) were more likely to have HCV-specific immune responses directed against HCV epitopes. Over time, HCV viral loads declined. Reproducible and biologically important gene expression changes occurred in co-infected patients who underwent successful cART. The effective suppression of HIV by cART initiated a cascade of early and late events in treated patients. Early events involving down-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes may have led to transiently increased viral replication and hepatic injury. At later time points, HCV viral load declined to levels comparable to those seen in the setting of HCV monoinfection. These findings support early antiretroviral therapy in those with HCV/HIV co-infection. "
8609,0.005,1.0000,"Central nervous system (CNS) human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection begins during primary viremia and continues throughout the course of untreated systemic infection. Although frequently accompanied by local inflammatory reactions detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), CNS HIV-1 infection usually is not clinically apparent. In a minority of patients, CNS HIV-1 infection evolves into encephalitis during the late stages of systemic infection, which compromises brain function and presents clinically as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome dementia complex (ADC). Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has had a major impact on all aspects of CNS HIV-1 infection and disease. In those with asymptomatic infection, ART usually effectively suppresses HIV-1 in CSF and markedly reduces the incidence of symptomatic ADC. In those presenting with ADC, ART characteristically prevents neurological progression and leads to variable, and at times substantial, recovery. Similarly, treatment has reduced CNS opportunistic infections. With better control of these severe disorders, attention has turned to the possible consequences of chronic silent infection and the issue of whether indolent, low-grade brain injury might require earlier treatment intervention."

The role of NK cells in the acute response to human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infected cells was investigated in a mouse model based on a HIV-1/murine leukemia virus (MuLV) pseudovirus. Splenocytes infected with HIV-1/MuLV were injected intraperitoneally and local immunologic responses and persistence of infected cells were investigated. In vivo depletion with an anti-NK1.1 antibody showed that NK cells are important in resistance to virus infected cells. Moreover, NK cell frequency in the peritoneal cavity increased in response to infected cells and these NK cells had a more mature phenotype, as determined by CD27 and Mac-1 expression. Interestingly, after injection of HIV-1/MuLV infected cells, but not MuLV infected cells, peritoneal NK cells had an increased cytotoxic activity. In conclusion, NK cells play a role in the early control of HIV-1/MuLV infected cells in vivo."

The participation rate was 85% at both initial recruitment (612/719) and follow-up (375/441; 171 men were ineligible for follow-up). For inmates who reported never having injected drugs, ever having injected drugs, having injected drugs during follow-up, and having shared needles/syringes during follow-up, HCV incidences per 100 person-years of incarceration risk were 1, 12, 19, and 27, respectively. Ever having injected drugs (relative risk = 13.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.5, 114.3) and having shared needles/syringes during follow-up (relative risk = 9.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 71.7) were significantly associated with HCV seroconversion. The effectiveness of existing interventions, including the provision of bleach tablets for sterilizing injection equipment, was suboptimal. The development of methadone maintenance programs in prisons and the creation of drug courts to keep offending drug injectors out of prison might help to reduce transmission in this setting."

Viral DNA and DNA polymerase activity were reduced significantly from the 1st week after starting the administration of Ara-A. This antiviral effect was maintained even at the 1st week after discontinuation of the drug. These findings were quite similar to those observed in HBV carriers. With the increasing necessity of Ara-A treatment in patients who will not respond to interferon therapy, DHBV seemed a suitable model for the investigation of the dose and antiviral effect of Ara-A treatment in humans."
15877,0.005,1.0000,"The human hepatoma cell line, PLC/PRF/5, which is persistently infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), has integrated HBV-DNA, secretes HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), and does not grow readily in congenitally athymic (nu/nu) mice. The present investigation was undertaken to ascertain whether the low tumorigenicity of this cell line was governed by a host immune response and/or was related to expression of HBsAg. Subcutaneous injection of 4-5 X 10(6) cells into BALB/c nude mice produced localized encapsulated tumors with morphologic features of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in 25% of the animals within 29-40 d. No tumor growth was observed at lower cell inocula. In contrast, SK-HEP-1, an HBV-negative human hepatoma cell line, produced tumors at 1-5 X 10(6) cells inocula in 66% of the animals. Immunosuppression of mice with antilymphocyte serum (ALS) or irradiation increased tumor incidence in mice inoculated with 1 X 10(6) PLC/PRF/5 cells to almost 100% and produced local invasiveness. Immunosuppression also reduced the latency, i.e., time to tumor appearance, and increased mean tumor weight. These results suggest that tumorigenicity was limited by the host immune response. The nature of the response was delineated by treating nude mice challenged with tumor cells with sheep anti-mouse interferon globulin (anti-IFN). When 2 X 10(6) cells were injected, tumor growth occurred in 75% of anti-IFN-treated mice, whereas controls injected with the same number of cells, but not receiving anti-IFN, failed to develop tumors. The tumors in the anti-IFN-treated mice were highly invasive and the latency period until tumor appearance was reduced to 3-5 d. An inverse correlation was found between susceptibility of the hepatoma cells to natural killer (NK) activity in vitro and resistance to tumor growth in vivo. In vitro cytotoxicity for PLC/PRF/5 cells was eliminated by anti-NK 1.1 and complement, establishing the effector cell as an NK cell. NK cell activity 14 d after inoculation of mice with PLC/PRF/5 cells was augmented against PLC/PRF/5 target cells but not against SK-HEP-1 cells. Treatment of mice with ALS, irradiation, or anti-IFN abolished NK activity against PLC/PRF/5 cells. Co-cultivation of nude mouse spleen cells with PLC/PRF/5 but not with HBsAg or SK-HEP-1 cells induced secretion of murine IFNalpha. These results suggest that the IFN/NK cell system may play a role in limiting tumorigenicity and invasiveness of HBV-infected human hepatocellular carcinoma cells by a mechanism similar to that found for other cells persistently infected with viruses."
13604,0.005,1.0000,"We analyzed dendritic cell (DC) and NK cell compartments in relation to CD4 recovery in 21 HIV-infected subjects followed to <50 copies/ml once starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) and observed for 52 wk of sustained suppression. Although CD4 counts increased in all subjects in response to ART, we observed a restoration of functional plasmacytoid DC (PDC) after 52 wk of sustained suppression under ART (from 1850 cells/ml to 4550 cells/ml) to levels comparable to controls (5120 cells/ml) only in subjects with a low baseline viral load, which also rapidly suppressed to <50 copies/ml upon <or=60 days from ART initiation. Recovery of PDC at week 52 correlates with level of CD95 expression on CD8 T cells and PDC frequency following first ART suppression. NK cytotoxic activity increased rapidly upon viral suppression (VS) and correlated with PDC function at week 52. However, restoration of total NK cells was incomplete even after 52 wk on ART (73 cells/mul vs 122 cells/mul in controls). Direct reconstitution experiments indicate that NK cytotoxic activity against virally infected target cells requires DC/NK cooperation, and can be recovered upon sustained VS and recovery of functional PDC (but not myeloid DC) from ART-suppressed subjects. Our data indicate that viremic HIV-infected subjects may have different levels of reconstitution of DC and NK-mediated function following ART, with subjects with lower initial viremia and the greatest reduction of baseline immune activation at VS achieving the greatest level of innate effector cell reconstitution."
19482,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated the effect of low-dose IL-2 therapy (daily 1.2 MIU/m(2), subcutaneously) on the number and phenotype of regulatory T cells (T(regs)) and natural killer (NK) cells in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients taking antiretroviral therapy. The frequency and phenotype of circulating T(regs) (defined as CD3(+) CD4(+) CD25(high) or CD3(+) CD4(+) FOXP3(+)) and NK cells (CD3(-) CD16(+)/CD56(+)) were evaluated at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. The expression of CD25, CTLA-4, and granzymes A and B by CD4(+) FOXP3(+) cells, as well as the expression of KIR receptors (NKB1, CD158a, and NKAT2) on NK cells, was evaluated. Low doses of IL-2 resulted in the augmented frequency and absolute number of T(regs) in coinfected individuals. FOXP3 levels per cell as well as augmented CD25 and CTLA-4 expression by T(regs) suggested that IL-2 may lead to both expansion and activation of T(regs), although changes in the proportion of CD4(+) FOXP3(+) cells were not associated with changes in HCV viral load and CD4(+) cells between baseline and week 12. NK cell frequency also increased after IL-2 therapy. Interestingly, the pattern of expression of KIR receptors was changed by IL-2 treatment, since the frequency of NK cells expressing NKB1 augmented whereas the frequency of NK expressing CD158a and NKAT2 decreased."
12421,0.005,1.0000,"We have reported the presence of a CD4+ subpopulation of Natural Killer cells (NK) in humans. These cells also express HIV coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4 and are infectable by HIV-1. Infection is productive and persistent in vitro and in vivo. Infected people under therapy have evidence of viral DNA in their NK pool. In vitro experiments show that the NK compartment is important for virus propagation, since HIV-1 growth is significantly reduced in PBMC depleted of NK cells. This reduction was observed for both R5 and X4 molecular clones of HIV-1. In addition, evidence is presented demonstrating that infected NK cells are killed less efficiently by the virus as compared to T cells. This is reminiscent of macrophage infection, where the virus-infected cells survive for long periods of time. Therefore, few infected NK cells may contribute significantly to the infectious virus produced in vitro. These results further underscore the importance of NK infection for understanding pathogenic mechanisms leading to AIDS, as well as the various reservoirs and sanctuaries for HIV upon antiretroviral treatment."
16525,0.005,1.0000,"BACKGROUND This study was performed to evaluate the effects and stability of the new hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG), Hepabulin, in patients undergoing liver transplantation for hepatitis B. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 87 patients undergoing liver transplantation for hepatitis B-related liver disease were enrolled in this multicenter, phase III, open-label, single-arm study. Seventy (80.5%) of the 87 enrolled patients completed the study during the 52-week study period. Hepabulin (10,000 units) was intravenously injected intraoperatively, daily for 1 week, weekly for 1 month, and then once per month. Hepabulin was used as monotherapy without antiviral agents. Hepatitis B recurrence was defined as conversion from negativity for surface antigen after HBIG administration to positivity. RESULTS There were no cases of hepatitis B recurrence during the 52-week observation period. A total of 876 adverse events (AEs) that occurred during the study period were observed in 83 (95.4%) of 87 patients, and serious AEs were seen in 119 cases in 44 (50.6%) of the 87 patients. None of the AEs showed a relationship with this drug. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) rapidly disappeared within 1 week after HBIG administration, but hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA persisted for up to 8 weeks after surgery, which was related to HBV viral load. Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) was correlated with HBIG (Hepabulin) dose. CONCLUSIONS The new HBIG, Hepabulin, was shown to be safe and effective in preventing the recurrence of HBV after liver transplantation."
4977,0.005,1.0000,"We performed a pilot study to evaluate the factors associated with response to interferon (IFN) therapy for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfected haemophiliacs. Seven haemophiliacs, coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), received 9 mega-units (MU) of natural IFN-alpha daily during the first 2 weeks and then three times a week for 22 weeks, all injected subcutaneously. Six patients were receiving zidovudine (AZT) 600 mg day-1 and didanosine (ddI) 200 mg day(-1) during IFN therapy. This treatment was safe and well tolerated. Four patients had no detectable serum HCV-RNA at the end of therapy, but long-term, none of the seven patients achieved a sustained response, i.e. undetectable serum HCV-RNA with persistently normal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 6 months after therapy. IFN did not affect CD4-positive cell counts. Most of our patients had high HCV-RNA loads and/or low CD4 counts, both unfavourable markers for IFN therapy. In conclusion, IFN therapy did not eradicate HCV from haemophiliacs coinfected with HIV."
11103,0.005,1.0000,"We report the case of a 25-year-old male Japanese homosexual with primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection and early stage syphilis. Approximately 60 days after HIV exposure by sex with another man, the patient abruptly had high fever, after which he experienced a variety of severe, prolonged symptoms such as painful oral mucosa ulcerations, rash, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and a 5.5-kg weight loss. Serum lactate dehydrogenase and liver biochemical test values were elevated. Antibodies to HIV by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot (WB) test were negative at the time of symptom onset, but serum HIV-1 RNA level was 1 585 000 copies/ml. Antibody seroconversions were found on day 9 after the onset of symptoms by ELISA and on day 16 by WB test, suggesting primary HIV infection. Within 2 weeks of starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), all symptoms except lymphadenopathy were resolved, and the serum HIV-1 RNA level dramatically decreased to 5011 copies/ml, eventually becoming undetectable by the standard method. The patient has remained asymptomatic for the 18 months since symptom resolution after HAART, and HIV-1 RNA remains undetectable."
17843,0.005,1.0000,"Previous studies concerning disparities in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) services use among vulnerable groups did not control for specific clinical need for care such as symptom events. Using the Andersen Behavioral Model of Health Services Use, the authors determined whether minorities, women, and the less educated (vulnerable groups) were less likely to receive care for HIV symptoms. Persons enrolled in the HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study were asked whether they received care for their most bothersome symptom. Surprisingly, minorities and women were no more likely to go without care than other groups. Those with Medicaid, Medicare, private health maintenance organization (HMO) insurance, or no insurance were less likely to receive care for symptoms than those with private-non-HMO insurance. Vulnerable groups were no less likely to use services for HIV-related symptoms when need for care was considered. However, disparities may exist for symptom-specific care among HIV infected persons covered by public or HMO insurance."
9412,0.005,1.0000,"Combination therapy for HIV-1 infection can reduce plasma virus to undetectable levels, indicating that prolonged treatment might eradicate the infection. However, HIV-1 can persist in a latent form in resting CD4+ T cells. We measured the decay rate of this latent reservoir in 34 treated adults whose plasma virus levels were undetectable. The mean half-life of the latent reservoir was very long (43.9 months). If the latent reservoir consists of only 1 x 10(5) cells, eradication could take as long as 60 years. Thus, latent infection of resting CD4+ T cells provides a mechanism for lifelong persistence of HIV-1, even in patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy."

The advent of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) has dramatically reduced the progression of HIV/AIDS, so that these individuals live longer, with nearly undetectable viral loads, and thus may develop obesity and similar obesity-related comorbidity as occurs in the general population. However, HAART also causes lipodystrophy, placing these patients at increased risk for coronary artery disease."

15643,0.005,1.0000,"With the prospect of increasing numbers of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), healthcare professionals (professionals) need to be better informed about patients' perspectives in order to provide efficacious, compassionate, and efficient care to patients. In Taiwan, the biomedical research and healthcare professionals' perspectives have dominated research related to HIV/AIDS. The purpose of the study was to investigate the stressors experienced by patients which have, thus far, been under-explored. This study used a phenomenological approach to gain insight into the patients' experience. In-depth, open-ended interviews were used to collect data. Interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim to maintain data integrity and to reduce perceptual bias. The open coding procedure was used to analyze the interview transcripts. Study participants were 14 male patients with an average age of 35.71 year-old, who had known their positive HIV status for an average of 24.9 months. Patients experienced multiple stressors because of having the life threatening illness of HIV/AIDS. Their stressors were identified as follows: being confronted with the diagnosis, fear of disclosure, unpredictability of their physical condition, hypervigilance toward physical symptoms, emotional upheaval, and constrained life planning. The findings of this study form the basis for professionals to design services particularly addressed to patients' needs, for example, informed testing, and pre- and post-counseling. Further efforts could focus on developing systemic intervention programs to help patients better cope with the challenges of living with HIV/AIDS."
14185,0.005,1.0000,"The incidence of HIV infection has increased tremendously over the last few years. The new 2006 estimates released by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), supported by UNAIDS and WHO, indicate that national adult HIV prevalence in India is approximately 0.36%, which corresponds to an estimated 2 million to 3.1 million people living with HIV in this country. The positive rate of HIV tested persons has shown a rising trend. So, a study was conducted on patients attending the surgery department for different operative procedures and 13 patients were HIV reactive out of 1697 patients tested. Routine HIV testing is usually not carried out at most centres and the medical fraternity is constantly exposed to the risk of HIV infection which can have wide-ranging implications in a health professional's life. HIV testing should be insisted on every patient before undertaking any surgical procedure routinely."

HIV surveillance data were reviewed for adults and adolescents (ages ≥13 years) living with HIV in 2008. Variables analyzed included demographics, region of origin (for persons born outside of the U.S.), insurance coverage, linkage to and continuous HIV care. Of the 16,513 DC residents living with HIV diagnoses, 1,391 (8.4%) were foreign-born. Of foreign-born infected, 71.9% were male; 33.3% were from Africa and 20.8% from Central America; 80.6% were exposed through sex; 36.3% had health coverage at diagnosis. While 100% of foreign-born persons had documented linkage to HIV care, only 18.0% had documentation of continued HIV care. These data suggest that strengthening continuous HIV care support after successful care linkage is warranted for foreign-born persons living with HIV in DC."
4799,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection accounts for about 1 million deaths worldwide annually. This study was to determine the prevalence, distribution of HBV, and factors associated with infection in an apparently healthy population in Nigeria. A cross-sectional study among the general population was conducted employing a multistage sampling technique. Data on demographic, social, and behavioral indicators were collected using questionnaires and blood samples tested for HBV seromarkers. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were done. Prevalence of hepatitis B infection was 12.2% (confidence interval [CI] = 10.3-14.5). Of the participants, more than half, 527 (54.6%), had evidence of previous exposure to HBV, while 306 (31.7%) showed no serologic evidence of infection or vaccination. Only 76 (7.9%) participants showed serologic evidence of immunity to HBV through vaccination. Factors associated with testing positive for HBV infection were dental procedure outside the health facility (odds ratios [OR] = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.52-7.70), local circumcision (OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.17-2.57), and uvulectomy (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.06-2.57). With logistic regression, only dental procedure outside the health facility (adjusted OR = 3.32, 95% CI = 1.38-7.97) remained significant. This first national survey on seroprevalence of hepatitis B describes the epidemiology and high prevalence of HBV infection in Nigeria and highlights the need for improved vaccination against HBV."
7468,0.005,1.0000,"TT virus (TTV) is a recently identified widespread DNA virus of humans that produces persistent viremia in the absence of overt clinical manifestations. In an attempt to shed light on the dynamics of chronic infection, we measured the levels of TTV in the plasma of 25 persistently infected patients during the first 3 months of alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) treatment for concomitant hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The first significant decline of TTV loads was observed at day 3 versus day 1 for HCV. Subsequently, the loads of TTV became progressively lower in most patients, but some initial responders relapsed before the end of the follow-up, suggesting that at least in some subjects the effects of IFN on TTV can be very short-lived. No correlation between the responses of TTV and HCV to therapy was found. Fitting the viremia data obtained during the first week of treatment into previously developed mathematical models showed that TTV sustains very active chronic infections, with over 90% of the virions in plasma cleared and replenished daily and a minimum of approximately 3.8 x 10(10) virions generated per day. Low levels of TTV were occasionally detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients who had cleared plasma viremia, thus corroborating previous results showing that these cells may support TTV replication and/or persistence."

Nevertheless, we still lack enough data to determine the reasons why approximately 10% of the performed sperm washes remain positive, thus forcing the repetition of the treatment. Semen quality in infected males is also essential to these procedures. We aimed to determine the predictive value of the semen parameters, sperm washing procedure and the infection status for the post-wash viral positivity, as well as the correlation between the semen and the disease features."
8950,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of osteopenia in HIV-infected patients is high. However, the mechanisms implicated in bone mass loss in HIV infection are unclear. Because of this, we analyzed serum free testosterone and vitamin D3 hydroxylated metabolites in HIV-infected patients, with and without antiretroviral treatment, and the relation between them and osteopenia. Seventy-four HIV-infected patients were selected because they had frozen sera available at a date close to a DEXA evaluation. Free testosterone, 25(OH)D3, and 1,25(OH)2D3 were determined in frozen serum. There were no differences in free testosterone, 25(OH)D3, and 1,25(OH)2D3 levels between patients with and without osteopenia. 25(OH)D3 levels in naive and HAART-treated patients were 26.2 (10.3-32.8) and 33.1 (20.6-46.8) ng/ml, respectively (p = 0.04). 1,25(OH)2D3 levels in naive and HAART treated patients were 60.3 (49.2-80.8) and 85.5 (68-111.6) pmol/liter (p = 0.01). Free testosterone levels in 9 naive men and in 50 HAART-treated men were 42.6 (24.1-67.3) and 69.2 (47.5-112.1) pmol/liter, respectively (p = 0.04). In conclusion, HIV-infected patients with and without osteopenia showed similar levels of vitamin D metabolites and free testosterone. However, antiretroviral drug-naive patients showed lower serum levels of vitamin D metabolites and free testosterone than HAART-treated patients."
7224,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) and the immunization status for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in febrile patients in two districts of the United Republic of Tanzania. Between February and March 2007, blood samples were collected in Pemba Island and Tosamaganga from 336 outpatients and sent to the Virology Laboratory in Rome (Italy) for testing. HHV-8 DNA and HBV-DNA were amplified by two in-house molecular methods, anti-HHV-8 antibody titers were determined by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and anti-HCV, HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc were evaluated by microplate enzyme immunoassay (MEIA). The seroprevalence of HHV-8 was 30.7% (96/313). In Pemba Island, the prevalence was lower than in Tosamaganga (14.4% vs. 46.3%). A higher prevalence of low titers of HHV-8 IgG (<1:80, 81%) was found among those under 5 years of age. HHV-8 DNA was detected in six seropositive patients (6.7%). The prevalence of HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc was 4.3%, 37.6%, and 29.3%, respectively. Out of 277 patients, 70 had had a previous infection (25.3%). One case of occult hepatitis was found. The cover of hepatitis B vaccination was higher among children born after 2002 (66.7%) than in patients born before 2002. HHV-8 infection is endemic in Tanzania and the seroprevalence rate was higher in the mainland than on Pemba Island. The 3.9% percentage of HBsAg in children younger than 4 years of age suggests that increased efforts are required in order to achieve universal and compulsory immunization of children against HBV."
5426,0.005,1.0000,"To evaluate the relationships between human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and hepatitis virus type B (HBV) infections, we compared both individual and geographical distributions of carriers of HTLV-I and HBV, and antibody positives to HBV in two ATL-endemic islands in Kyushu, Japan. The positive rates of antibodies to HTLV-I (anti-HTLV-I-Ab) in sera among healthy inhabitants older than 30 years of age were 27.5% (617/2,232) in Nakadohri, Goto Island and 24.0% (500/2,048) in Shimo-agata, Tsushima Island. The positive rates for surface antigen of hepatitis B virus (HBs-Ag) in sera among the same subjects were 6.4% and 2.5%, respectively. In Nakadohri, the age-adjusted positive rates of HBs-Ag and antibody to HBs-Ag (anti-HBs-Ab) in anti-HTLV-I-Ab positives (so-called HTLV-I carriers) differed little from those in negatives. In Shimo-agata, the geographical distribution of HBs-Ag positives (so-called HBV carriers) showed no positive association with that of HTLV-I carriers. These results did not support the positive correlations between HTLV-I and HBV infections among the general population in ATL-endemic areas in Japan."
18891,0.005,1.0000,"A detailed study of the skin lesions of 248 patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Bangkok, Thailand, is reported. The study population consisted of 140 patients with asymptomatic disease (stage I), 27 patients with symptomatic disease (stage II), and 81 patients with advanced stage of the disease (stage III). Ninety-five percent of all patients were observed to have one or more skin disorders. Conditions with prevalence higher than 5% included oral candidiasis (34.3%), pruritic papular eruption (32.7%), seborrhoeic dermatitis (21.0%), herpes zoster (16.1%), oral hairy leucoplakia (14.9%), herpes simplex (10.9%), onychomycosis (9.3%), cutaneous ringworm (7.7%), psoriasis (6.5%), and folliculitis (5.6%). Patients in the stage II and III subgroups were found to have a significantly more number of skin disorders than patients in stage I. The prevalence pattern of skin disorders in this study are generally similar to previous studies in the literature. Three notable differences, however, emerge from this study: (1) the high prevalence of pruritic papular eruption in all subgroups, (2) the high prevalence of Penicillium maneffei infection in patients with advanced disease, and (3) the absence of Kaposi's sarcoma in the study population. Knowledge about the cutaneous disease pattern in the locals will be more clinically relevant for proper care of the patients."
15891,0.005,1.0000,"We examined 100 serial patients who were receiving care in a county outpatient immunodeficiency clinic and whose serum was positive by Western blot test for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Skin disorders were found in 92% of these HIV-infected patients, with little difference in prevalence or severity in three clinical categories: patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex, and those who were asymptomatic. Patients positive for HIV antibodies had significantly more skin disease, with the exception of dermatophytosis, than did a historical control population. A strong association was observed between the use of zidovudine and the absence of infection with Candida albicans. We conclude that there is a high prevalence of skin disease in HIV-positive patients who seek medical care, and that specialists in skin disease should be included in these patients' initial evaluation and continuing care."

15944,0.005,1.0000,"Although iron supplementation is considered beneficial for groups at risk for anemia, concern has been raised that it could be harmful during human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Studies suggest: (1) faster HIV disease progression in thalassemia major patients receiving inadequate doses of iron-chelating drug; (2) higher mortality among patients receiving iron supplementation with dapsone compared with aerosolized pentamidine for prophylaxis against Pneumocytis carinii pneumonia; (3) higher iron stores and mortality among patients with haptoglobin Hp 2-2 phenotype; and (4) shorter survival among patients with high bone marrow iron deposition. These studies largely involved men in developed countries. Among HIV-infected pregnant women in Africa with a high prevalence of iron deficiency, no relationship was found between indicators of iron status and HIV disease severity. The available data do not contraindicate the current practice of iron supplementation in developing countries where there is a high prevalence of both HIV infection and iron deficiency."
4958,0.005,1.0000,"Nutritional supplementation to tuberculosis (TB) patients has been associated with increased weight and reduced mortality, but its effect on the pharmacokinetics of first-line anti-TB drugs is unknown. A cohort of 100 TB patients (58 men; median age, 35 [interquartile range {IQR}, 29 to 40] years, and median body mass index [BMI], 18.8 [17.3 to 19.9] kg/m(2)) were randomized to receive nutritional supplementation during the intensive phase of TB treatment. Rifampin plasma concentrations were determined after 1 week and 2 months of treatment. The effects of nutritional supplementation, HIV, time on treatment, body weight, and SLCO1B1 rs4149032 genotype were examined using a population pharmacokinetic model. The model adjusted for body size via allometric scaling, accounted for clearance autoinduction, and detected an increase in bioavailability (+14%) for the patients in the continuation phase. HIV coinfection in patients not receiving the supplementation was found to decrease bioavailability by 21.8%, with a median maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24) of 5.6 μg/ml and 28.6 μg · h/ml, respectively. HIV-coinfected patients on nutritional supplementation achieved higher Cmax and AUC0-24 values of 6.4 μg/ml and 31.6 μg · h/ml, respectively, and only 13.3% bioavailability reduction. No effect of the SLCO1B1 rs4149032 genotype was observed. In conclusion, nutritional supplementation during the first 2 months of TB treatment reduces the decrease in rifampin exposure observed in HIV-coinfected patients but does not affect exposure in HIV-uninfected patients. If confirmed in other studies, the use of defined nutritional supplementation in HIV-coinfected TB patients should be considered in TB control programs.

15992,0.005,1.0000,"Observational studies have associated vitamin A deficiency with vaginal shedding of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected cells and mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission. To assess the effect of vitamin A supplementation on vaginal shedding of HIV-1, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 6 weeks of daily oral vitamin A (10,000 IU of retinyl palmitate) was conducted among 400 HIV-1-infected women in Mombasa, Kenya. At follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of HIV-1 DNA (18% vs. 21%, P=.4) or the quantity of HIV-1 RNA (3.12 vs. 3.00 log(10) copies/swab, P=1.0) in vaginal secretions of women receiving vitamin A, compared with women receiving placebo. No significant effect of supplementation on plasma HIV-1 load or CD4 or CD8 cell counts was observed, and no effect was seen among women who were vitamin A deficient at baseline. Vitamin A supplementation is unlikely to decrease the infectivity of women infected with HIV-1."
3818,0.005,1.0000,"An important role for selenium in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease has been proposed. Decreased selenium levels, as found in persons with HIV infection or AIDS, are sensitive markers of disease progression. Selenium deficiency, an independent predictor of mortality in both HIV-1-infected adults and children, is an essential micronutrient that is associated with an improvement of T cell function and reduced apoptosis in animal models. In addition, adequate selenium may enhance resistance to infections through modulation of interleukin (IL) production and subsequently the Th1/Th2 response. Selenium supplementation up-regulates IL-2 and increases activation, proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death of T helper cells. Moreover, selenium supplementation may down-regulate the abnormally high levels of IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha observed in HIV disease, which has been associated with neurologic damage, Kaposi's sarcoma, wasting syndrome, and increased viral replication. Together, these findings suggest a new mechanism through which selenium may affect HIV-1 disease progression."

6280,0.005,1.0000,"The introduction of potent combinations of antiviral drugs is a major breakthrough in the treatment of HIV. We investigated the long-term virologic outcome and the development of resistance after initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in drug-naive patients in daily clinical practice. Twenty-five treatment-naive HIV-1 patients were started on HAART. Fifteen patients responded with a drop in viral load below the limit of detection during 35.5 (interquartile range: 7) months of therapy. In 6 of 10 patients with virologic failure, virus with resistance-related mutations against the received drugs emerged. Compared with responders (R), nonresponding (NR) patients were in a later disease stage at therapy start (p = 0.0089) with lower CD4 cell counts at baseline (p = 0.040), and a lower proportion of nonresponders showed protease inhibitor (PI) levels above C(min) (p = 0.049). More NR patients showed secondary PI mutations at baseline (p = 0.079), and the CCR2-64I coreceptor polymorphism was absent among NR patients, compared with 38.5% of R patients displaying CCR2-64I (p = 0.053), although the differences were not significant. In conclusion, starting HAART in antiretroviral drug-naive HIV-infected patients followed in daily clinical practice prevented viral breakthrough for up to 44 months in 60% of the patients. Virologic failure was associated with the development of resistance-related mutations, a later stage of disease at start of therapy and lower PI drug levels."

This clinic was participating in a blind surveillance project administered by the local health department. The project was designed to estimate the prevalence of seropositivity for HIV among women seeking family planning services within the department's catchment area. The expectation was that the population of women choosing voluntary sterilization would be of relatively low risk for HIV infection. Surprisingly, however, when they were examined, nearly 25% of these women reported at least one identified risk factor for HIV infection. The rates for certain specific risk factors are no lower among these women than among the general population."

A multi-stage sampling design covering all administrative areas of Libya was applied, covering > 65,000 individuals of all age groups. All subjects gave a blood sample and completed a questionnaire on demographic and risk behaviour data. The prevalence of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV were 2.2% and 1.3% respectively. The prevalence of anti-HCV increased with age, rising gradually after age 30 years, in contrast to a stable prevalence of HBsAg in all age groups 10+ years. Age-adjusted risk factors for HCV infection were previous hospitalization, surgical operations, previous blood transfusions and intravenous drug use; for HBV infection only family exposure or contact with HBV case were identified."

17479,0.005,1.0000,"Women are the fastest growing segment of the AIDS cases in the United States. They constitute nearly half of all the AIDS cases worldwide. Recent advances in Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapies (HAART) have reduced AIDS mortality remarkably. But as longer use of these combination regimens makes evident, unexpected side effects are now reported that might reflect gender-based differences in occurrence. Controversy still exists in relation to the level of HIV-1 quantification in men and women and its association with disease progression. Women have been reported to have lower viral loads with equal progression or higher progression with equal viral loads. This finding has not been consistent in all studies. Psychosocial variables, such as poverty, lack of care and young age, adversely affect more women than men. If the viral dynamics are thought to be different, then the response to treatment might be as well. So far, the effectiveness of HAART has been seen equally among men and women. Barriers to adherence, such as caregiving burdens, multiplicity of roles and fear of disclosure, might disproportionately affect women. By far the best news is that the survival of both men and women has improved with the newer therapeutic advances."
559,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reduces the viral burden in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected patients. The paper addresses the problem of controlling the predator-prey like model of the interaction among CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell, and HIV-1 by an external drug agency. By exploring the dynamic properties of the system, the original system is first regrouped into two subsystems, then a nonlinear global controller is presented by designing two controllers over two complementary zones: a local controller on a finite region and a global controller over its complement. The local controller is designed to guarantee nonnegativty, and avoids the problem of control singularity within the neighborhood of the origin omega. The complementary controller is designed via backstepping for both subsystems over the complementary region. The closed-loop system is globally stable at nominal values through the introduction of a novel bridging virtual control, and the resulting controller is singularity free and guarantees nonnegativity. In this paper, simulations are conducted in discrete-time with sampling time Ts to show the effectiveness of the proposed method."
1943,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to examine the association between perceived family support, either positive or negative, and adherence to antiretroviral medication regimens among HIV-positive individuals in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. We measured past 3-month antiretroviral adherence among 233 HIV-positive individuals, in relation to perceived family support, both positive (in terms of emotional and instrumental support) and negative (in the form of negative interactions), using the 10-item Nepali Family Support and Difficulty Scale. Medium and high levels of perceived emotional support from family were associated with reduced risk of antiretroviral nonadherence, compared with low levels of perceived emotional support (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]  = 0.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.16, 0.88], and AOR  = 0.23, 95% CI [0.08, 0.64], respectively). Conversely, higher levels of felt emotional distance (AOR  = 1.46, 95% CI [1.00, 2.14]) and experienced physical harm (AOR  = 2.04, 95% CI [1.07, 3.91]) were associated with increased risk of nonadherence. The results support the recommendation that service providers need to be aware of the significant role of family support in shaping antiretroviral adherence and to consider ways to strengthen positive family support while minimizing negative family interactions to increase adherence rates.

18835,0.005,1.0000,"The current study delineated patterns and predictors of adherence to antiretroviral therapy in 329 persons living with HIV disease in rural areas of 12 US states. Participants provided self-report data on patterns of HIV medication adherence, reasons for missing medication doses, psychological symptomatology, life-stressor burden, social support, ways of coping, coping self-efficacy, the quality of their relationship with their main physician, and barriers to health care and social services. Based on adherence data collected via retrospective, self-report assessment instruments, only 50% of participants adhered consistently to antiretroviral therapy regimens in the past week. Consistent adherence was more common in White participants, persons who had progressed to AIDS, and 'native infections' (i.e. persons who were born, raised, and infected in their current place of residence). Logistic regression analyses indicated that consistent adherence was reported by persons who drank less alcohol, had a good relationship with their main physician, and engaged in more active coping in response to HIV-related life stressors. As the number of rural persons living with HIV disease continues to increase, research that identifies correlates of non-adherence and conceptualizes approaches to optimize adherence in this group is urgently needed."

This paper evaluates the use of AZT and other antiretroviral agents, as well as access to, and utilization of, medical and social services among intravenous drug users (IDUs) in Miami, Florida. An ongoing prospective study of street-recruited IDUs in Miami-Dade County identified 20 HIV-infected IDUs who had HIV disease (CDC classification IV), and took antiretroviral and other medications after intervention. Participants included 13 active and 7 inactive IDUs. Longitudinal data and in-depth interviews made possible detailed studies of participants during periods when they were taking antiretroviral medications. Those IDUs who are HIV-positive have also received intensive medical and social services. Participants in the study reported nausea, malaise, insomnia, and dysphoria upon initiating AZT therapy. Eleven readily attributed these symptoms to use of antiretroviral medications, primarily AZT. Nevertheless, 9 reported an overall positive impression of the drug's effects; seven despite initial negative reactions to the medication. These results, plus measurement of medication in the blood, indicate that the IDUs studied not only took the antiviral(s), but often were willing to do so in spite of this medication making them feel bad."

The latest version of the HIV treatment guidelines are summarized here, with attention focused on the rationale for treatment of asymptomatic as well as symptomatic individuals, including when and what to start as a first regimen of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Components of initial and follow-up evaluations are detailed, with attention given to available HIV viral load tests and their use. Because adherence to HAART is critical to immune recovery and stabilization, data on predictors of both good and poor medication compliance, as well as strategies to maximize medication adherence are presented.

The authors have encountered eight cases of HHV-8-associated BCBL in HIV-infected patients. A literature search revealed an additional 50 reported cases of HIV-related BCBL, as well as reports of several other disorders associated with HHV-8 DNA. Comprehensive analysis of the clinical and pathobiological features of all 58 known cases of HIV-related BCBL shows it to be a unique B-cell neoplasm with a strong propensity for body-cavity involvement without mass lesions and with little or no dissemination, poor prognosis, high grade usually immunoblastic morphology, late B-cell phenotype and genotype, no associated c-myc gene rearrangement, frequent presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome, and uniform association with HHV-8 DNA. Considering these features in the context of other disorders associated with HHV-8 DNA, HHV-8 appears to play a causal role in BCBL, possibly in concert with EBV, and may induce this lymphoma through dysregulation of cytokines, particularly interleukin-6, or infection of an unusual B-cell subset. The characteristics of HHV-8-associated BCBL suggest a possible role for antiherpes or anticytokine agents in the treatment of this lymphoma."

We studied 78 patients with human inmunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) infection in WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 and 81 matched seronegative controls. All participants were examined using a standardized neurological examination and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Cognitive impairment and PR was found in 36% of patients but in none of the controls (P<0.0001; logistic regression odds ratio: 14.7). Overall, PR were 2-36 times more frequent in patients with HIV-1 infection. This association was stronger for the glabellar, snout, Rossolimo, and digital signs. At least two PR were observed in 92% of patients vs. 8% of controls (P<0.0001; 95% confidence interval: 68%-100%; logistic regression odds ratio: 10.8). These data support the association of PR with cognitive decline in patients with advanced HIV-1 infection without overt neurological disease. Larger follow-up studies with multivariate techniques are needed to identify which PRs are useful as indicators of HIV-1-associated cognitive/motor complex and minor neurocognitive disorders."

Anemia (serum hemoglobin <100 g/L) occurred in 137 (16%) patients, of whom only 14 (10%) received erythropoietin. Hemoglobin decline >30g/L from baseline occurred in 76% of patients overall, including 526 patients who did not become anemic. Virological responses were higher in anemic patients compared with those who did not develop anemia (end of treatment, 80% versus 65%, P = 0.003; SVR, 61% versus 50%, P = 0.02); these differences remained significant when patients receiving erythropoietin were excluded from analysis. SVR was also higher in patients with hemoglobin decline >30 g/L compared with patients without a similar decline. In multiple logistic regression analyses with treatment group and baseline characteristics, the odds ratio for SVR was 1.97 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.62) for anemia and 2.17 (95% confidence interval, 1.31-3.62) for hemoglobin decline >30 g/L.

Serum levels of HBsAb were obtained and analyzed in four of these patients. Two patients were HBs antigen (HBsAg) positive. One of these HBsAg-positive patients was treated with lamivudine because the patient developed fulminant hepatitis from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection prior to chemotherapy. However, none of the other patients were administered lamivudine. An HBsAg-positive patient who did not receive lamivudine treatment later developed fulminant hepatitis. Another HBsAg-positive patient receiving lamivudine prophylaxis did not develop severe hepatitis arising from HBV. In the three patients not receiving lamivudine treatment, serum HBsAb titers decreased soon after the administration of rituximab. These results suggest that rituximab reduced the antibody titer for HBV, thus inducing an immunological environment leading to easy reactivation of HBV. Lamivudine prophylaxis was effective, at least when rituximab was given to an HBsAg-positive patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Within a prospective cohort based at two public sector ART clinics, BP was measured at ART initiation and every 6 months thereafter as a routine clinic procedure. Predictors of HBP (systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg) during one year on ART were analyzed using logistic regression, and the proportion with HTN (2+ episodes of HBP >3 months apart) described. A phone survey was used to understand patient awareness of HBP, use of anti-hypertensive drugs, and history of cardiovascular events (CVE; myocardial infarction or stroke). Among 896 cohort participants, 887 (99.0%) had at least one BP measurement, 98 (10.9%) had HBP, and 57 (6.4%) had HTN. Increasing age (10-year increase in age: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.93), male sex (AOR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.43-3.80), and overweight/obesity (AOR = 4.07; 95% CI 1.94-8.53) were associated with HBP.

14121,0.005,1.0000,"The advent of antiretroviral therapy has significantly improved AIDS-related morbidity and mortality. Yet, among people living with HIV, deaths due to non-AIDS-defining illnesses have been on the rise. The objective of this study was to provide information about the global prevalence and distribution of non-AIDS causes of death in the last ten years among people living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy, by income levels of countries. We used broad search terms in Google Scholar, PubMed, and EMBASE to identify all studies that investigated the cause of death among people living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy, published after January 1, 2005. References were also identified from review articles and reference lists. Inclusion criteria were English language, the study's end date was after 2005, all patients were HIV-positive, at least two-thirds of the patients were receiving antiretroviral therapy, at least one patient died of non-AIDS causes of death. Titles, abstracts, and articles were reviewed by at least two independent readers. Of 2951 titles identified in our original search, 151 articles were selected for further screening. We identified 19 studies meeting our full criteria, with patients from 55 different nations. Pooled non-AIDS causes of death prevalence estimates in high-income countries were 53.0% (95% confidence interval, 43.6-62.3), in developing countries 34.0% (95% confidence interval, 20.3-49.1), and in sub-Saharan countries 18.5% (95% confidence interval, 13.8-23.7). Statistically significant variation was noted within and between categories. Our findings show that a significant number of people living with HIV across the world die from cardiovascular disease, non-AIDS malignancies, and liver disease. There is a global need for further scrutiny in all regions to improve preventive measures and early detection according to distinct causes of death patterns."

The subjects were followed for at least 36 months (mean: 121.3 months) between 1973 and 1991. Among 69 cases where anti-HD was detected, eight (12%) developed liver cirrhosis (LC) and six (9%) developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, among 1058 cases without anti-HD, there were 43 patients (4%) who developed LC and 29 (3%) who developed HCC. The prevalence of LC and HCC was significantly higher among the cases with anti-HD than those without anti-HD. The proportion of LC and HCC per 1000 person years was 10.46 and 7.84, respectively among cases with anti-HD, and 4.05 and 2.73 among those without anti-HD, respectively. The overall relative risk of LC and HCC was 2.58 and 2.87, respectively; 95% confidence interval (CI): LC, 1.14-5.13; HCC, 1.03-6.23. These results indicate that in the Kure district in Japan, where HDV infection of persons infected with HBV is about 6%, such superinfection increases the risk of LC and HCC."

Univariate analysis of potential risk factors for mother-to-child transmission showed an association between primiparity and increased transmission rate: odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-4.6, P < 0.05. Analysis by logistic regression confirmed this association (adjusted odds ratio 2.4) and showed, in addition, a negative association between transmission rate and elective Caesarean section (adjusted odds ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.97, P < 0.05). The effect of primiparity was less pronounced in combination with elective Caesarean section (odds ratio 1.7) than with other delivery modes (odds ratio 2.5, difference not significant).

9209,0.005,1.0000,"Measles in persons coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been reported to be unusual in its presentation and frequently fatal. To determine the effect of HIV coinfection on the clinical features and outcome of measles, a prospective study of hospitalized children with measles was conducted between January 1998 and October 2000 in Lusaka, Zambia. One-sixth (17%) of 546 children hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed measles were coinfected with HIV. One-third of the HIV-infected children hospitalized with confirmed measles were <9 months old, compared with 23% of HIV-uninfected children (P=.03). Few differences in clinical manifestations, complications, or mortality were found between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children with measles. HIV-infected children constitute a significant proportion of children hospitalized with measles in countries with high HIV prevalence and are more likely to be younger than the age for routine measles immunization."

Two hundred three (40%) of the 510 patients were coinfected with HCV. HCV coinfected patients were less likely to be on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and were frequently hospitalized with higher CD4 counts for non-HIV-related medical problems including complications of liver disease."
12356,0.005,1.0000,"We examined the impact of HBV/HIV coinfection on outcomes in hospitalized patients compared to those with HBV or HIV monoinfection. Using the 2011 US Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we identified patients who had been hospitalized with HBV or HIV monoinfection or HBV/HIV coinfection using ICD-9-CM codes. We compared liver-related admissions between the three groups. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality, length of stay and total charges. A total of 72 584 discharges with HBV monoinfection, 133 880 discharges with HIV monoinfection and 8156 discharges with HBV/HIV coinfection were included. HBV/HIV coinfection was associated with higher mortality compared to HBV monoinfection (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.30-2.15) but not when compared to HIV monoinfection (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.96-1.54). However, the presence of HBV along with cirrhosis or complications of portal hypertension was associated with three times greater in-hospital mortality in patients with HIV compared to those without these complications (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.80-5.02). Length of stay and total hospitalization charges were greater in the HBV-/HIV-coinfected group compared to the HBV monoinfection group (+1.53 days, P < 0.001; $17595, P < 0.001) and the HIV monoinfection group (+0.62 days, P = 0.034; $8840, P = 0.005). In conclusion, HBV/HIV coinfection is a risk factor for in-hospital mortality, particularly in liver-related admissions, compared to HBV monoinfection. Overall healthcare utilization from HBV/HIV coinfection is also higher than for either infection alone and higher than the national average for all hospitalizations, thus emphasizing the healthcare burden from these illnesses."

19864,0.005,1.0000,"In Lusaka, Zambia, rotavirus (RV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection commonly coexist; 132 (25%) of 537 consecutively studied infants < 5 years old hospitalized with diarrhea were positive for both viral infections. Infants with RV infection were younger than those who were RV-negative (P > .05), and infants with both viruses more frequently experienced dehydration (P < .05). HIV-infected children more often exhibited respiratory symptoms on admission to the study (P < .0001) and were more frequently underweight (P < .0001) than were HIV-negative children, independent of RV infection. The mortality rate was highest in HIV-positive infants (P < .05), and coinfection with RV did not increase the risk of fatality. This study demonstrates that while RV and HIV infections commonly coexist in one region of Africa, RV infection is no more common nor is the illness more severe in HIV-positive infants."
6206,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of electrolyte disturbances in AIDS patients developing acute kidney injury in the hospital setting, as well as to determine whether such disturbances constitute a risk factor for nephrotoxic and ischemic injury. A prospective, observational cohort study was carried out. Hospitalized AIDS patients were evaluated for age; gender; coinfection with hepatitis; diabetes mellitus; hypertension; time since HIV seroconversion; CD4 count; HIV viral load; proteinuria; serum levels of creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium and magnesium; antiretroviral use; nephrotoxic drug use; sepsis; intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and the need for dialysis. Each of these characteristics was correlated with the development of acute kidney injury, with recovery of renal function and with survival. Fifty-four patients developed acute kidney injury: 72% were males, 59% had been HIV-infected for >5 years, 72% had CD4 counts <200 cells/mm(3), 87% developed electrolyte disturbances, 33% recovered renal function, and 56% survived. ICU admission, dialysis, sepsis and hypomagnesemia were all significantly associated with nonrecovery of renal function and with mortality. Nonrecovery of renal function was significantly associated with hypomagnesemia, as was mortality in the multivariate analysis. The risks for nonrecovery of renal function and for death were 6.94 and 6.92 times greater, respectively, for patients with hypomagnesemia. In hospitalized AIDS patients, hypomagnesemia is a risk factor for nonrecovery of renal function and for in-hospital mortality. To determine whether hypomagnesemia is a determinant or simply a marker of critical illness, further studies involving magnesium supplementation in AIDS patients are warranted."
7199,0.005,1.0000,"Intron 1 of the interferon-gamma (IFNG) gene contains two polymorphisms. The 12 CA-repeat allele of the +875 IFNGCA microsatellite and the T allele of the +A874T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) have been associated with increased in vitro IFNG production and a variety of clinical phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether these polymorphisms influence total serum IgE levels [tsIgE] and the outcome of a hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. IFNGCA and +A874T were typed in 186 asthmatics of Niuean ancestry and in Polynesian women with a chronic HBV infection (n = 60) and with natural immunity to the HBV (n = 66). The IFNGCA genotype was associated with [tsIgE] in asthmatic children (n = 51, p = 0.004) but not adults (n = 135, p = 0.87). The data were consistent with a co-dominant influence of the 12 CA-repeat allele on high [tsIgE]. The IFNGCA genotype was also associated with the risk for chronic HBV infection (chi (2) = 11.6, p = 0.003) because of a dominant effect of the 12 CA-repeat allele on developing natural immunity in homozygotes (OR = 5.8, p = 0.003) and heterozygotes (OR = 2.7, p = 0.01). Similar associations were found for the T allele of the +A874T SNP. The possibility that these associations were due to linked alleles in the adjacent 783 bp of the promoter and 3'-untranslated region of the IFNG gene was excluded by direct sequencing. In summary, high-IFNG-producing alleles in intron 1 of the IFNG locus are associated with high [tsIgE] in asthmatic children from Niue and with natural immunity to the HBV in Polynesian women. These findings are consistent with a previous report of an association between +875 IFNGCA and [tsIgE] and provide preliminary evidence of a new association with the outcome of an HBV infection."
15825,0.005,1.0000,"BACKGROUND. The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an essential component of the innate immune response to various microorganisms. We investigated the association between TLR4 polymorphism and the risk of acquiring severe infections, in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. METHODS. The presence of TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was determined in a cohort of 199 HIV-1 infected patients and evaluated in relation to the occurrence of various infections. RESULTS. One hundred seventy-two patients were homozygous for the wild-type genotype; 22 patients (11%) were heterozygous for both SNPs; 4 were heterozygous for 1 polymorphism; 1 patient was heterozygous for the Asp299Gly SNP and homozygous for the Thr399Ile SNP. Of individuals with a nadir CD4 cell count of <100 cells/mm(3), those who carried both SNPs, compared with those who carried the wild-type genotype, demonstrated a >3-fold increase in the odds ratio (OR) of any serious infection (OR, 6.33 vs OR, 1.83, P = .043). CONCLUSIONS. This study suggests an association between the presence of TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms and the occurrence of serious infections in HIV-1 infected patients with a history of nadir CD4 cell count of <100 cells/mm(3)."
18549,0.005,1.0000,"There is great interindividual variability in HIV-1 viral setpoint after seroconversion, some of which is known to be due to genetic differences among infected individuals. Here, our focus is on determining, genome-wide, the contribution of variable gene expression to viral control, and to relate it to genomic DNA polymorphism. RNA was extracted from purified CD4+ T-cells from 137 HIV-1 seroconverters, 16 elite controllers, and 3 healthy blood donors. Expression levels of more than 48,000 mRNA transcripts were assessed by the Human-6 v3 Expression BeadChips (Illumina). Genome-wide SNP data was generated from genomic DNA using the HumanHap550 Genotyping BeadChip (Illumina). We observed two distinct profiles with 260 genes differentially expressed depending on HIV-1 viral load. There was significant upregulation of expression of interferon stimulated genes with increasing viral load, including genes of the intrinsic antiretroviral defense. Upon successful antiretroviral treatment, the transcriptome profile of previously viremic individuals reverted to a pattern comparable to that of elite controllers and of uninfected individuals. Genome-wide evaluation of cis-acting SNPs identified genetic variants modulating expression of 190 genes. Those were compared to the genes whose expression was found associated with viral load: expression of one interferon stimulated gene, OAS1, was found to be regulated by a SNP (rs3177979, p = 4.9E-12); however, we could not detect an independent association of the SNP with viral setpoint. Thus, this study represents an attempt to integrate genome-wide SNP signals with genome-wide expression profiles in the search for biological correlates of HIV-1 control. It underscores the paradox of the association between increasing levels of viral load and greater expression of antiviral defense pathways. It also shows that elite controllers do not have a fully distinctive mRNA expression pattern in CD4+ T cells. Overall, changes in global RNA expression reflect responses to viral replication rather than a mechanism that might explain viral control."
17533,0.005,1.0000,"Persistent genital human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) shedding among women receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) may present a transmission risk. We investigated the associations between genital HIV-1 suppression after ART initiation and adherence, resistance, pretreatment CD4 cell count, and hormonal contraceptive use. First-line ART was initiated in 102 women. Plasma and genital HIV-1 RNA levels were measured at months 0, 3, and 6. Adherence was a strong and consistent predictor of genital HIV-1 suppression (P < .001), whereas genotypic resistance was associated with higher vaginal HIV-1 RNA level at month 6 (P = .04). These results emphasize the importance of adherence to optimize the potential benefits of ART for reducing HIV-1 transmission risk."
11163,0.005,1.0000,"To evaluate the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 on the natural history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, sera from Central Africans with and without antibodies to HIV were examined for HBV markers of ongoing replication, recovery from infection, and reactivation or reinfection. The prevalence of HBV infection and HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was similar for HIV-positive and -negative persons. AIDS patients were more likely to be HBsAg positive and have markers of viral replication. Unlike pre-surface (pre-s) 1 antigen (Ag), which did not differ significantly with respect to HIV infection, pre-s2Ag was more common among HIV-positive persons than among HIV-negative ones and was more common among AIDS patients than among HIV-positive asymptomatic carriers. HIV-positive persons had more markers consistent with HBV reactivation and lower levels of antibody to HBsAg."
5017,0.005,1.0000,"We examined the effect of bacterial pneumonia on the magnitude of circulating plasma HIV RNA in HIV-infected patients. Serum samples from 13 adult HIV-infected patients (median CD4 count = 83 cells/microl) were assayed for HIV RNA using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (a) before bacterial pneumonia, (b) during the acute phase, and (c) after the recovery from the disease. Patients remained on constant antiretroviral therapy: HIV RNA was detected in all samples tested. The medians before, during, and after bacterial pneumonia were 60,000 copies per ml, 245,000 copies per ml, and 84,000 copies per ml, respectively. All 13 patients had increased HIV RNA levels on developing pneumonia. There was a decline in the level of HIV RNA with recovery from pneumonia in 12 of 13 patients. The difference between the HIV RNA levels before and after pneumonia was not significant, nor was there significant difference in the CD4 counts before and after pneumonia. In conclusion, bacterial pneumonia is associated with a consistent, transient increase in HIV RNA of variable magnitude in AIDS patients. Interpretation of HIV RNA changes for clinical management of AIDS patients must take into account this reversible elevation during infections."
635,0.005,1.0000,"The large majority of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) markers of disease progression/severity previously identified have been associated with alterations in host genetic and immune responses, with few studies focused on viral genetic markers correlate with changes in disease severity. This study presents a cross-sectional/longitudinal study of HIV-1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contained within the viral promoter or long terminal repeat (LTR) in patients within the Drexel Medicine CNS AIDS Research and Eradication Study (CARES) Cohort. HIV-1 LTR SNPs were found to associate with the classical clinical disease parameters CD4+ T-cell count and log viral load. They were found in both defined and undefined transcription factor binding sites of the LTR. A novel SNP identified at position 108 in a known COUP (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter)/AP1 transcription factor binding site was significantly correlated with binding phenotypes that are potentially the underlying cause of the associated clinical outcome (increase in viral load and decrease in CD4+ T-cell count).

16648,0.005,1.0000,"Histoplasmosis is a common opportunistic infection in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who reside in areas where Histoplasma capsulatum is endemic. We undertook a prospective study of a cohort of 304 HIV-Infected patients in Kansas City from October 1990 through March 1993 to define the incidence-specific risk factors, and pathophysiology of histoplasmosis. The annual incidence of histoplasmosis was 4.7%; 74% of the patients with histoplasmosis were symptomatic (all of whom had disseminated disease). A history of exposure to chicken coops, a positive baseline serology for complement-fixing antibodies to Histoplasma mycelium antigen, and a baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count of < 150/microL were associated with an increased risk for histoplasmosis. Histoplasmin reactivity and the presence of pulmonary calcifications were not useful markers for patients at high risk. Symptomatic infection occurred in 9.9% of patients with evidence of prior exposure to H. capsulatum, in 4.0% of patients without documented prior exposure, and in 3.0% of patients who were anergic; these findings suggest that the pathophysiology of histoplasmosis in patients with AIDS involves reactivation of latent infection in some cases and dissemination of exogenously acquired infection in other cases."
8952,0.005,1.0000,"Acute hepatitis C infection is recognized in HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM), but the risk in HIV-negative MSM remains unclear. We evaluated a population of MSM with acute hepatitis C. From January 2010 to May 2014, all cases of HCV antibody positive HIV-negative MSM were identified. European AIDS Network criteria were applied to determine acute infection, and 44 individuals fulfilled the criteria for acute hepatitis C. Ten were RNA negative at baseline and classed as prior spontaneous clearance. 15 (34.1%) had a previously negative HCV antibody within 1 year. 11 (25.0%) had significant elevation in ALT levels, and 18 (40.9%) were clinically diagnosed from risk exposure and history. Median age was 37 years (range 24-75). 41 (93.2%) individuals reported unprotected anal sex, 36 with (87.8%) both insertive and receptive intercourse, 4 (9.8%) with receptive intercourse, 1 (2.4%) with insertive intercourse, and no data were recorded for 3 (7.3%) patients. Individuals had an average of 7.3 reported (median 2, range 1-100) partners. 12 (27.3%) engaged in group sex, 11 (25.0%) practised fisting, 11 (25.0%) admitted using drugs during sexual activity, 16 (36.4%) reported nasal, and 9 (20.5%) reported injection drug use. 14 (31.8)% had unprotected sex whilst under the influence of recreational drugs. 29 individuals were aware of a partner's status. 2 (4.5%) individuals had sexual contact with a known HCV monoinfected partner, 13 (29.5%) with a HIV monoinfected partner and 6 (13.6%) with a HCV/HIV coinfected partner. 9 (20.5%) reported a partner/partners with no known infection. No data were available in 14 (31.8%) individuals. 13 (29.5%) individuals had a coexisting STI at the time of acute HCV diagnosis. 8 (18.2%) received HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) within the 6 months prior to the HCV diagnosis (2 were participants in a HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis trial). 15 (34.1%) individuals achieved spontaneous clearance of HCV, and 11 patients received HCV treatment.

10274,0.005,1.0000,"To examine the epidemiology and natural history of mother-to-infant transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), especially genetic and intrapartum exposure factors, we obtained data on twins and triplets born to women infected with the virus. 40 investigators in nine countries contributed demographic, clinical, and epidemiological data on 100 sets of twins and 1 set of triplets. Among the 66 evaluable sets, HIV-1 infection was more common in first-born than in second-born twins (p = 0.004). In 22 sets, only one twin was infected (18 first-born, 4 second-born). 50% of first-born twins delivered vaginally and 38% of first-born twins delivered by caesarean were infected, compared with 19% of second-born twins delivered by either route. HIV-1 infection status tended to be concordant in more monozygotic (14 of 17 sets) than dizygotic (26 of 43) sets, but the frequency and clinical signs of HIV-1-related disease were similar in only 3 of the 10 sets with both children infected. These findings suggest that some infants may be infected in utero before labour but that a substantial proportion of HIV-1 transmission occurs as the first twin encounters the cervix and birth canal. Such measures as cleansing of the birth canal and caesarean delivery before membrane rupture might reduce the risk of transmission for infants born to HIV-1-infected women and should be the subjects of controlled clinical trials. Caesarean section should not be regarded as a wholly preventive measure, however, since substantial proportions of both first-born and second-born twins delivered in this way were infected."

We conducted a seroepidemiologic study among 174 HIV-positive heterosexuals in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1999. Evidence of exposure to HCV, HBV, and HTLV-I/II was found in 32%, 17%, and 5%, respectively. A higher prevalence of HBV infection was observed among males (33%) compared with females (12%; P < 0.05). Among women, a prior history of a sexually transmitted infection, injecting drug use (IDU), having had more than five lifetime sex partners, and having exchanged sex-for-goods were significantly associated with HCV infection, whereas an IDU history, syringe sharing, and having exchanged sex-for-goods were found to be associated with HBV infection. Among men, an IDU history and syringe/needle sharing were significantly associated with HCV infection. The IDU-related and sexual transmission of hepatitis viruses constitute a significant problem among young, HIV-infected, heterosexuals in Argentina."

All the possible risk factors for HTLV-1 seropositivity among first-time blood donors were evaluated in Mashhad, Iran, during the period of 2011-2012. Blood donation volunteers were interviewed for demographic data, medical history, and behavioral characteristics and the frequencies of risk factors were compared between HTLV-1 positive (case) and HTLV-1 negative (control) donors. The data was analyzed using Chi square and t-tests. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for the infection. Assessments were carried out on 246 cases aged 17-60 and 776 controls aged 17-59, who were matched based on their ages, gender, and date and center of donation. Logistic analysis showed low income (OR = 1.53, p = 0.035), low educational level (OR = 1.64, p = 0.049), being born in the cities of either Mashhad (OR = 2.47, p = 0.001) or Neyshabour (OR = 4.30, p < 0001), and a history of blood transfusion (OR = 3.17, p = 0.007) or non-IV drug abuse (OR = 3.77, p < 0.0001) were significant predictors for infection with HTLV-1. Lack of variability or small sample size could be reasons of failure to detect some well-known risk factors for HTLV-1 infection, such as prolonged breastfeeding and sexual promiscuity. Pre-donation screening of possible risk factors for transfusion-transmissible infections should also be considered as an important issue, however, a revision of the screening criteria such as a history of transfusion for more than one year prior to donation is strongly recommended.

19786,0.005,1.0000,"A novel DNA virus, TT-virus (TTV), has been reported in patients with non-A-G posttransfusion hepatitis in Japan. We sought to determine whether TTV infection occurs in North American blood donors and to further determine the prevalence of TTV infection in several groups of patients with liver disease, including patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis and idiopathic fulminant hepatic failure. TTV infection was sought by detection of TTV DNA in serum by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers generated from a conserved region of the TTV genome. Blood donors, patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, idiopathic fulminant hepatic failure, and patients with other forms of advanced liver disease with and without a history of parenteral exposures were studied. TTV infection was present in 1% (1 of 100) of blood donors, 15% (5 of 33) of patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, 27% (3 of 11) of patients with idiopathic fulminant hepatic failure, 18% (2 of 11) of patients with a history of exposure to blood products, and 4% (1 of 25) of patients without parenteral risk factors. For all patients tested, a history of prior exposure to blood products was associated with an increased risk of TTV infection (relative risk, 4.5; 90% confidence intervals, 0.6-43.9). We conclude that TTV infection is present among North American blood donors and is common in patients with liver disease, including cryptogenic cirrhosis and fulminant hepatic failure. Further studies are required to determine the role of TTV in the pathogenicity of acute and/or chronic liver disease."
3896,0.005,1.0000,"The risk for occupational transmission of HIV-1 in the health setting is extremely small. Current data from a number of prospective studies of health care workers sustaining adverse exposure to blood or other body fluids from patients infected with HIV-1 demonstrate that the rate for transmission of infection following a needlestick injury is approximately 0.5%. Similar data regarding the risk for occupational transmission of hepatitis B virus infection, however, indicates that the rate of transmission of infection with this virus following a needlestick injury may be as high as 30% and the risk for transmission of other blood-borne infections is poorly defined. Infection control precautions designed to minimize the risk for HIV-1 infection were recommended by CDC shortly following the first reported case of AIDS in the United States. These measures were implemented for patients diagnosed with or suspected to be infected with HIV-1, determined by history-taking or serologic evaluation. The inability of these mechanisms to accurately identify all infected individuals, coupled with the occurrence of undiagnosed or unrecognized blood-borne infections, emphasizes the need for health care workers to consider all patients as potentially infected with HIV-1 or other blood-borne pathogens. Implementation and enforcement of universal precautions should minimize exposure of health care personnel to blood and body fluids and thus substantially reduce the risk for occupational transmission of HIV-1 and other blood-borne infections in the health care environment."

However, adequacy of drug exposures after these administration routes are largely unknown, making dosing recommendations and the attainment of viral suppression challenging in this patient population. This report describes a patient with advanced HIV infection and a complicated medical history including long-term intractable nausea/vomiting necessitating antiretroviral medication administration via a Roux-en-Y jejunostomy (J)-tube. Pharmacokinetic assessments were performed to compare differences in antiretroviral drug absorption and plasma exposure following oral and J-tube administration of dolutegravir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and emtricitabine. Results were also compared with published pharmacokinetic data in HIV-infected individuals. Exposure to dolutegravir and tenofovir were similar between J-tube and oral administration routes, whereas emtricitabine exposure was 38% lower when administered via J-tube. However, in comparison with reference data in HIV-infected individuals taking these medications orally, exposure to dolutegravir and tenofovir was 75-76% and 55-61% lower, respectively, following both routes of administration. Emtricitabine exposure was similar to and 71% higher than reference data following J-tube and oral administration, respectively. This report highlights the importance of performing pharmacokinetic assessments in patients with the potential for impaired drug absorption to ensure antiretroviral treatment success."

We performed a systematic review of the association of socioeconomic status (SES) with adherence to treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS in low- and middle-income countries. We searched electronic databases to identify studies concerning SES and HIV/AIDS and collected data on the association between various determinants of SES (income, education, occupation) and adherence to ART in low- and middle-income countries. From 252 potentially-relevant articles initially identified, 62 original studies were reviewed in detail, which contained data evaluating the association between SES and adherence to treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS. Income, level of education, and employment/occupational status were significantly and positively associated with the level of adherence in 15 studies (41.7%), 10 studies (20.4%), and 3 studies (11.1%) respectively out of 36, 49, and 27 studies reviewed. One study for income, four studies for education, and two studies for employment found a negative and significant association with adherence to ART. However, the aforementioned SES determinants were not found to be significantly associated with adherence in relation to 20 income-related (55.6%), 35 education-related (71.4%), 23 employment/occupational status-related (81.5%), and 2 SES-related (100%) studies. The systematic review of the available evidence does not provide conclusive support for the existence of a clear association between SES and adherence to ART among adult patients infected with HIV/ AIDS in low- and middle-income countries.

As occult HBV infection could have an impact on the outcome of liver disease in HIV-positive patients, we investigated a large number of HIV-positive/HBV-surface-antigen (HBsAg) negative subjects with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection by using the 'gold standard' approach for occult HBV detection--analysis of liver DNA extracts."
11900,0.005,1.0000,"The impact of demographic, psychosocial, and medical regimen-related variables on adherence of 123 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients to antiretroviral therapy was assessed by means of refill methodology. Satisfaction with social support (P = .029), problem-focused coping (P = .027), and active-behavioral coping (P = .011) correlated significantly with adherence, whereas loss of motivation (P = .006), hopelessness (P = .16), and avoidant coping (p = .015) correlated with nonadherence. At the 6-month follow-up, the mean CD4 cell count differed significantly among adherent versus nonadherent patients (a mean increase of 78/mm3 vs. a mean decrease of 5/mm3; P = .018). Adherence did not correlate with the number of antiretroviral medications consumed per day (mean, 3.0 vs. 2.5). Non-Caucasian patients were more likely to be nonadherent than Caucasian patients (relative risk, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-5.3; P = .013); this difference was not explained by age, education, employment, income, history of intravenous drug use, or medical regimen. Non-Caucasian patients, however, were less satisfied with their social support (P = .04) and informational support (P = .016) and were more likely to utilize emotion-focused coping (P = .01). Thus, satisfaction with social support and coping style significantly impacted adherence and likely accounted for the observed racial difference in adherence among HIV-infected patients."
7741,0.005,1.0000,"HIV prevalence in the American Deep South has reached crisis proportions and greater numbers of patients are enrolling in clinical care and beginning antiretroviral therapy (ART). In order to gain maximum benefit from ART, patients must sustain high levels of adherence to demanding regimens over extended periods of time. Many patients are unable to maintain high rates of adherence and may need assistance to do so, which may be based upon an understanding of barriers to adherence for a given population. The current study sought to gain understanding of barriers to adherence for a mixed urban/rural HIV-positive patient population in Mississippi and to determine whether barriers to adherence may be specific to gender, employment, depressive symptoms or educational attainment status. Seventy-two patients who missed a dose of ART medication over the last three days endorsed the top five reasons for missing a dose as: (1) not having the medication with them, (2) sleeping through the dose time, (3) running out of the medication, (4) being busy with other things and (5) other. Reported barriers were fairly consistent across different groups, although women and those classified as having moderate to severe depressive symptoms reported different patterns of adherence barriers. Results suggest that adherence interventions implemented in the Deep South must take into account specific barriers faced by individuals within this region, where stigma, gender disparities and limited resources are prevalent."
18928,0.005,1.0000,"Studies from sub-Saharan Africa indicate that children made vulnerable by poverty have been disproportionately affected by HIV with many exposed via mother-to-child transmission. For youth living with HIV, adherence to life-saving treatment regimens are likely to be affected by the complex set of economic and social circumstances that challenge their families and also exacerbate health problems. Using baseline data from the National Institute of Child and Human Development (NICHD) funded Suubi+Adherence study, we examined the extent to which individual and composite measures of equity predict self-reported adherence among Ugandan adolescents aged 10-16 (n = 702) living with HIV. Results showed that greater asset ownership, specifically familial possession of seven or more tangible assets, was associated with greater odds of self-reported adherence (OR 1.69, 95% CI: 1.00-2.85). Our analyses also indicated that distance to the nearest health clinic impacts youth's adherence to an ARV regimen. Youth who reported living nearest to a clinic were significantly more likely to report optimal adherence (OR 1.49, 95% CI: 0.92-2.40). Moreover, applying the composite equity scores, we found that adolescents with greater economic advantage in ownership of household assets, financial savings, and caregiver employment had higher odds of adherence by a factor of 1.70 (95% CI: 1.07-2.70). These findings suggest that interventions addressing economic and social inequities may be beneficial to increase antiretroviral therapy (ART) uptake among economically vulnerable youth, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This is one of the first studies to address the question of equity in adherence to ART among economically vulnerable youth with HIV."

This paper describes an HIV-clinic-based demonstration project aimed at decreasing patient HIV-transmission risk behaviors and sexually transmitted infections. Systematic, computer-assisted assessment of patient risk aided primary care providers in delivering prevention messages. Patients at greater risk were referred to an HIV Prevention Specialist for behavioral counseling. Patients completed a computerized behavioral staging assessment to self-identify risk behaviors and readiness to change behaviors and counseling messages were individually tailored based on computer assessment. Challenges to project implementation: primary care provider buy-in, patient privacy concerns during risk assessment, and low participation in behavioral counseling. Forty-six percent of persons completing a risk assessment (2,124) were at risk for HIV transmission. Of 121 patients who scheduled counseling appointments, 42% completed at least one session. Despite challenges, successful implementation of a clinic-based prevention intervention is feasible, particularly with attention to patient and provider concerns."
2983,0.005,1.0000,"Transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from an infected health-care worker to patients is rare, with the greatest potential for occurrence during exposure-prone, invasive surgical procedures in which the blood of the health-care worker might come into contact with patients' blood or mucous membranes. When a surgeon is discovered to have HIV infection, a decision must be made about notification of patients, but only limited data are available to guide decision-making. Such notifications generally are decided upon on a case-by-case basis, taking into account such factors as the nature of the procedures performed, the infection-control knowledge and practices of the infected surgeon, the presumed likelihood of transmission, and available resources. This report describes the case of a cardiothoracic surgeon in Israel specializing in open-heart procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting and valve surgery) who was found to be HIV positive in January 2007 during evaluation for fever of recent onset. The duration of infection was unknown. A lookback investigation of patients operated on by the infected surgeon during the preceding 10 years was conducted under the auspices of the Israel Ministry of Health to determine whether any surgeon-to-patient HIV transmission had occurred. Of 1,669 patients identified, 545 (33%) underwent serologic testing for HIV antibody. All results were negative. A Ministry-appointed panel of experts delineated conditions under which the surgeon could resume work. The results of this investigation add to previously published data indicating a low risk for provider-to-patient HIV transmission."

However, little is known of the association of these two disorders in the HIV population. Our objective was to investigate the association between a marker of atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcium [CAC]) and low bone mineral density (BMD) in a cross-sectional cohort of HIV-infected patients. The study was conducted at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy. A total of 636 consecutive middle-aged, HIV-infected subjects were recruited between January 2006 and December 2010. All patients underwent CAC and BMD assessment. Patients were categorized according to a CAC score <100 or >100 units based on previous literature that identified this cut-point as a marker of increased risk. Low femoral and lumbar spine BMD was defined as <25th percentile value for the study cohort. Logistic regression and bootstrap analysis were used to assess the independent association between CAC and BMD. The main outcome measure was a CAC score >100. Patients with CAC > 100 were older and more likely to be men, diabetic, and overweight. Patients with CAC < 100 had better renal function and a lower cardiovascular risk profile. After adjusting for age, sex, traditional and HIV-specific risk factors, vitamin D level, and PTH level, there was a significant association between CAC > 100 and low BMD for the femur (OR = 2.33, 95 % CI 1.09-4.99; p = 0.02) but not for the spine. Bootstrap analyses confirmed these findings. In summary, CAC was independently associated with low femoral BMD in HIV-infected patients. Future studies should test whether therapies that attenuate cardiovascular risk in HIV favorably impact bone health."

Phylogenetic analysis of the E2 region of the isolates from HCV-seroconverted patients showed the sequences were grouped in the same distinct branch as in a chronically HCV-infected patient, suggesting that the chronically infected patient was the index case. For the patients with HBV infection, phylogenetic analysis showed strong clustering among the sequences of the three patients who seroconverted to HBsAg and no relatedness between them and the sequences of patients chronically infected with HBV. For one of the patients who seroconverted to HBsAg, the last test with negative results for HBV markers had been performed 18 months prior to HBsAg seroconversion. This patient may have been previously infected with HBV and is presumed to be the source of the outbreak. This report emphasizes the importance of using universal precaution measures and HBV vaccination to prevent the transmission of viral hepatitis among chronic hemodialysis patients."
4933,0.005,1.0000,"The incidence of stroke in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals has been well analyzed in recent epidemiological studies. However, little is known about the specific contribution of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to stroke among HIV-infected individuals. The aims of this study were to analyze trends in the incidence rates of stroke in HIV-infected individuals during the combination antiretroviral (cART) era in Spain and to categorize them by the presence or absence of HCV coinfection. We analyzed hospital discharges with a diagnosis of stroke in Spain according to ICD-9-CM during 1997-2013. The study period was divided into four calendar periods (1997-1999, 2000-2003, 2004-2007, and 2008-2013). Patients were classified according to HCV serology. The number of HIV-infected patients was estimated based on data from the National Centre of Epidemiology. We calculated incidence rates (events per 10,000 patient-years) and in-hospital case fatality rates (CFR). The incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (HS) decreased in HIV-monoinfected patients (15.8 [1997-1999] to 6.5 [2008-2013]; P<0.001) and increased in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (1.3 [1997-1999] to 5.5 [2008-2013]; P<0.001). The incidence of ischemic stroke (IS) decreased in HIV-monoinfected patients (27.4 [1997-1999] to 21.7 [2008-2013]; P = 0.005) and increased in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (1.8 [1997-1999] to 11.9 [2008-2013]; P<0.001). The CFR was 3.3 times higher for HS than for IS for the whole study period. The CFR of HS in HIV-monoinfected patients decreased significantly (47.4% [1997-1999] to 30.6% [2008-2013]; P = 0.010) but did not change significantly among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (41.4% [1997-1999] to 44.7% [2008-2013]; P = 0.784). The CFR of IS in the whole HIV-infected population decreased significantly (14.6% [1997-1999] to 10.9% [2008-2013]; P = 0.034), although no significant differences were found when each group was analyzed separately. In conclusion, after the introduction of cART, HS and IS rates decreased in HIV-monoinfected individuals, but increased steadily in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals."
6168,0.005,1.0000,"Kidney transplantation is a viable treatment for select patients with HIV and ESRD, but data are lacking regarding long-term outcomes and comparisons with appropriately matched HIV-negative patients. We analyzed data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR; 2002-2011): 510 adult kidney transplant recipients with HIV (median follow-up, 3.8 years) matched 1:10 to HIV-negative controls. Compared with HIV-negative controls, HIV-infected recipients had significantly lower 5-year (75.3% versus 69.2%) and 10-year (54.4% versus 49.8%) post-transplant graft survival (GS) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.15 to 1.64; P<0.001) that persisted when censoring for death (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.84; P=0.005). However, compared with HIV-negative/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-negative controls, HIV monoinfected recipients had similar 5-year and 10-year GS, whereas HIV/HCV coinfected recipients had worse GS (5-year: 64.0% versus 52.0%, P=0.02; 10-year: 36.2% versus 27.0%, P=0.004 [HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.77; P=0.01]). Patient survival (PS) among HIV-infected recipients was 83.5% at 5 years and 51.6% at 10 years and was significantly lower than PS among HIV-negative controls (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.68; P<0.01). However, PS was similar for HIV monoinfected recipients and HIV-negative/HCV-negative controls at both times. HIV/HCV coinfected recipients had worse PS compared with HIV-negative/HCV-infected controls (5-year: 67.0% versus 78.6%, P=0.007; 10-year: 29.3% versus 56.23%, P=0.002 [HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.22; P=0.01]). In conclusion, HIV-negative and HIV monoinfected kidney transplant recipients had similar GS and PS, whereas HIV/HCV coinfected recipients had worse outcomes. Although encouraging, these results suggest caution in transplanting coinfected patients. "
4195,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated the precision and accuracy of a procedure for detecting recent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, specifically, the avidity index (AI) calculated using a method based on an automated AxSYM HIV 1/2gO assay (Abbott). To evaluate precision, we performed multiple replicates on eight HIV-positive serum samples. To evaluate the accuracy in identifying recent infections (i.e., within 6 months of seroconversion), we used 216 serum samples from 47 persons whose dates of seroconversion were known. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the procedure for different AI cutoff values, we performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. To determine the effects of antiretroviral treatment, advanced stage of the disease (i.e., low CD4-cell count), and low HIV viral load on the AI, we analyzed 15 serum samples from 15 persons whose dates of seroconversion were unknown. The precision study showed that the procedure was robust (i.e., the total variance of the AI was lower than 10%). Regarding accuracy, the mean AI was significantly lower for samples collected within 6 months of seroconversion, compared to those collected afterwards (0.68 +/- 0.16 versus 0.99 +/- 0.10; P < 0.0001), with no overlap of the 95% confidence intervals. The ROC analysis revealed that an AI lower than 0.6 had a sensitivity of 33.3% and a specificity of 98.4%, compared to 87.9 and 86.3%, respectively, for an AI lower than 0.9. Antiretroviral treatment, low CD4-cell count, and low viral load had no apparent effect on the AI. In conclusion, this procedure is reproducible and accurate in identifying recent infections; it is automated, inexpensive, and easy to perform, and it provides a quantitative result with different levels of sensitivity and specificity depending on the selected cutoff."
11288,0.005,1.0000,"Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 29 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were cultured by two different methods. One was the standard co-culture technique, the other a newly developed microculture method. In this assay 10(6) PBMCs were cultivated in 250 microliters medium, no activating agents or allogeneic cells were present. P24 antigen production measured by this method was found in 7 out of 11 PBMC cultures of patients in the Walter Reed (WR) stage 1 or 2, whereas only 4 samples were positive by the co-culture procedure. Cultures from patients in the later stages of the disease (WR 5/6) showed a higher p24 production by the co-culture method than by the microculture assay. It is assumed that rapidly growing HIV strains can be better assessed by the co-culture method which may select for these strains. P24 expression can be more easily obtained by the microculture technique even in cases where slowly replicating strains may be present. In conclusion, results from the microculture procedure described may be a useful supplementation to findings observed by the co-culture method."

The progression of hepatitis C is extremely variable and there is frequently a poor correlation among liver biochemistry, viral load and the stage of liver disease. Liver biopsy remains the only definitive way of staging fibrosis and grading necroinflammatory activity. Concerns have been expressed about the safety of the procedure; however, with modern regimes for the correction of coagulopathy in patients with inherited bleeding disorders, normal haemostasis may be maintained during the peribiopsy period. We performed 21 liver biopsies between 1984 and 1997 on patients with factor VIII (FVIII) or IX (FIX) deficiency and von Willebrand's Disease (VWD). Four had concomitant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, five were thrombocytopenic and one had a prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Haemostasis was achieved using an intermittent bolus of factor concentrate or continuous infusion regimens. One patient with VWD received Desmopressin (DDAVP). There were no bleeding episodes associated with biopsy. We suggest that liver biopsy is a safe procedure in patients with inherited bleeding disorders when the coagulopathy is fully corrected. It is the only definitive method of staging the extent of fibrosis associated with hepatitis C infection, and it is this that defines prognosis."
4830,0.005,1.0000,"It is generally agreed that middle ear reconstructive surgery performed with tympano-ossicular homografts produces superior functional results compared with prosthetic material, especially with respect to extrusion rate. The use of homografts, though, has been seriously hampered recently by the fear of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In HIV-infected patients, the virus is primarily found in the cells of the lymphoid and monocytic lineage. The nature of the tissues in the eardrum and ossicles, mostly fibrous tissue and compact bone without marrow, suggests that little virus load should be found in homografts. Indeed, culturing minced homograft tissue from two HIV-infected donors with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in a sensitive culture system with PHA-stimulated lymphoblasts produced no virus. Before use, homografts undergo a fixation procedure in 5% formaldehyde and then are kept in a solution containing Cialit as a preservative. The authors therefore examined the capacity of formaldehyde and Cialit to reduce the infectivity of HIV in models of infected tissue as measured in vitro. The reduction of in vitro infectivity due to these treatments was at least 10(5)-fold and 10(2)-fold, respectively. Coupled with the low virus burden in tympano-ossicular tissue, our data suggests that the fixation procedure affords such a reduction in infectivity that the risk of HIV transmission, even from an HIV-infected donor, is vanishingly low."
16279,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment of human plasma with methylene blue in combination with visible light (MB/light) inactivates several bloodborne viruses such as retro viruses and herpes viruses. The viral nucleic acid is thought to be a critical target for the inactivation procedure. We investigated the effects of photodynamic treatment on the RNA of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) using Amplicor reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which detects and quantifies a small fragment of the viral RNA. The detectable HCV RNA load (5-nontranslated region) in infected human plasma declined by 94-97 % within 10 min of illumination in small-scale experiments (1-2 ml vol.). Since the same effect was observed in both anti-HCV positive and negative (""window"") samples, it can be concluded that HCV antibodies do not influence virus inactivation by photodynamic treatment. The effect of treatment on RT-PCR signals of HIV-1, which is known to be inactivated rapidly by MB/light treatment, was examined. Plasma was infected with HIV-1 and subjected to RT-PCR, which detected a part of the gag gene. The extent and kinetics of PCR signal reduction induced by MB/light treatment were similar to those observed for HCV. Experiments at production scale where single plasma units (300 ml) were infected with HCV showed reduction rates of PCR signals consistent with those measured in the small-scale experiments. The data support the view that MB/light treatment affects the viral nucleic acids and suggest that HCV is susceptible to the procedure."

H9 cells experimentally infected with HIV-1 were treated by the test fixation procedure, washed, and cocultured with equal numbers of live, uninfected H9 cells. To estimate the reduction in infectivity due to the fixation procedure, dilution series of live infected H9 cells in uninfected H9 cells were simultaneously established in culture. Cell cultures were incubated 8-10 d, harvested, and evaluated for evidence of HIV-1 infection by the presence of cell-associated HIV-1 antigens and/or by the presence of particle-associated reverse transcriptase activity in cell culture supernatants. Thirty-minute fixation with formaldehyde (1.85%), methanol (absolute), methanol:acetone (1:1), or paraformaldehyde (0.5%) reduced the infectivity of HIV-1-infected H9 cells by greater than 99.99%. To the same degree, a multi-step fixation procedure utilizing formaldehyde and ethanol was effective in reducing HIV-1 infectivity.

A 55 year old, severe haemophiliac, known to be positive for HIV antibody, presented with a short history of motor weakness and variable sensory loss in both lower limbs. Clinical examination, electrophysiology and sural nerve biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of CIDP. He was treated with a 4-day course of high dose i.v. immunoglobulin, given as a daily infusion. This resulted in dramatic improvement in his neurological status which was evident both clinically and functionally. We conclude that CIDP can occur in HIV-positive haemophiliacs as it does in homosexuals and drug abusers infected with the virus. We also suggest that high dose i.v. immunoglobulin may be effective in the treatment of this condition, especially when practical difficulties preclude the use of plasmapheresis and the use of immunosuppressive drugs is considered hazardous."

Genotypic combinations of KIR3DS1/L1 and HLA Bw4-80I were previously shown to influence HIV-1 disease progression, however other KIR genes have not been well studied. In this study, we analyzed the influence of all activating and inhibitory KIR, in association with the known HLA inhibitory KIR ligands, on markers of disease progression in a West African population of therapy-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects. We observed a significant association between carriage of a group B KIR haplotype and lower CD4+ T cell counts, with an additional effect for KIR3DS1 within the frame of this haplotype. In contrast, we found that individuals carrying genes for the inhibitory KIR ligands HLA-Bw4 as well as HLA-C1 showed significantly higher CD4+ T cell counts. These associations were independent from the viral load and from individual HIV-1 protective HLA alleles. Our data suggest that group B KIR haplotypes and lack of specific inhibitory KIR ligand genes, genotypes considered to favor NK cell activation, are predictive of HIV-1 disease progression."

Serum IgE levels have been shown to rise with progressive disease. The authors evaluated IgE in 148 HIV-seropositive individuals with or without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Mean serum IgE levels were compared between groups based on absolute CD4 lymphocyte counts or clinical status (CDC) and with a seronegative control group. Higher serum IgE levels were observed in seropositive-patients. A rise in IgE serum is common in patients with HIV infection; it could be link with an earlier dysregulation in the IgE synthesis. No correlation was found between IgE level and CD4 counts."
19853,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease and liver-related death worldwide, with the majority of these cases occurring in areas of Africa and Asia where HBV prevalence is high. Many of the countries that are affected by hepatitis B are also affected by a high HIV burden, leading to frequent HIV/HBV co-infection. The consequences of co-infection, including increased liver-related morbidity and mortality, increased hepatitis B viral replication, immune reconstitution to HBV in the setting of antiretroviral therapy, and hepatotoxicity from antiretroviral drugs, are especially important in regions with expanding antiretroviral programmes. Little data, however, are available on HIV/HBV co-infection from regions with high chronic hepatitis B prevalence. This Review discusses the epidemiology, natural history, pathogenesis, and management of HIV/HBV co-infection from these areas. Topics for future research relevant to HIV/HBV co-infection in Africa and Asia are also highlighted."

Treatment for HBV reinfection with lamivudine pretransplantation and posttransplantation together with hepatitis B immunoglobulin could abolish recurrence of HBV infections following liver transplantation. We report the experience at our center in which lamivudine has been used in combination with low doses of immunoglobulin. Lamivudine (100 mg/d) was administered to liver transplant candidates for at least 4 weeks before transplantation and was continued posttransplantation indefinitely. Immunoglobulin was administered intramuscularly (10,000 IU at time of liver transplantation; 1,000 IU for 1 week; 1,000 IU weekly the first month; and 1,000 IU monthly thereafter). Lamivudine and low-dose immunoglobulin administration prevents posttransplantation recurrence of hepatitis B with 100% efficiency; it is well tolerated and is less cost-effective than high-dose immunoglobulin regimens."

9257,0.005,1.0000,"Although prolactin (PRL) is now recognized as a cytokine and persistent immune activation is a common immunopathogenic feature of the human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV), the circumstances associated with the onset of hyperprolactinemia during the course of this infection remain controversial. Given that PRL is able to exert not only endocrinologic effects but also immunologic influences, a study was conducted to investigate whether raised serum levels of PRL were more likely to prevail when HIV-infected patients developed concomitant infections. Serum PRL concentrations, as well as immunoglobulin isotypes, plasmatic viral burden, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, and natural killer (NK) cell counts were measured in 46 nonselected HIV-infected patients stratified on the basis of the presence or absence of clinically active concomitant infections. Serum PRL levels were significantly higher in patients presenting secondary infections as compared with the asymptomatic ones, with hyperprolactinemia being detected in 10/18 (55%) and 2/28 (7%) of these patient groups, respectively. Hyperprolactinemia was not related with viral burden, antiretroviral treatment, gender differences, or CD4+ cell counts. CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ cells were significantly lower in the group presenting active infections, whereas comparisons in NK cell counts, immunoglobulin levels and HIV viral burden revealed no differences between groups. These results provide evidence that hyperprolactinemia is more prevalent during the onset of secondary infections, which might have diagnostic and therapeutic consequences."
2680,0.005,1.0000,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a broad concept reflecting a patient's general subjective perception of the effect of an illness or intervention on physical, psychological and social aspects of their daily life. HRQoL among patients infected with HIV has become an important indicator of impact of disease and treatment outcomes. A cross-sectional survey was carried out at Chitungwiza Central Hospital, Zimbabwe, to assess HRQoL in patients with HIV/AIDS receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), using two validated instruments. The HIV/AIDS-targeted quality of life (HAT-QoL) and EuroQoL Five-dimensions-Three-level (EQ-5D-3L) instruments were used to assess HRQoL. Internal consistency reliability and convergent validity of the two instruments were also evaluated. For construct validity, the relationships between HRQoL scores and socio-economic and HIV/AIDS-related characteristics were explored. The median scores for the HAT-QoL dimensions ranged from 33.3 (financial worries) to 100 (HIV mastery). A considerably low HAT-QoL dimension score of 50.0 was observed for sexual function. There were ceiling effects for all HAT-QoL dimension scores except for financial worries and disclosure worries. Floor effects were observed for financial worries and sexual function. The median of the EQ-5D-3L index and visual analogue scale (VAS) was 0.81 and 79.0, respectively. There were no floor or ceiling effects for both the EQ-5D-3L index and VAS. The overall scale Cronbach's alpha was 0.83 for HAT-Qol and 0.67 for EQ-5D-3L. HAT-QoL demonstrated good convergent validity with EQ-5D index (0.58) and VAS (0.40). A higher level of HRQoL was positively and significantly related to income, education and employment. The patients' self-reported HRQoL was generally satisfactory in all the HAT-QoL dimensions as well as the two components on the EQ-5D-3L instrument. The two instruments demonstrated good measurement properties in HIV/AIDS patients receiving ART and have potential for use, alongside biomarkers, in monitoring outcomes of interventions."
12575,0.005,1.0000,"Monocytes are known as an alternative target for HIV/SIV infection, but the contribution of monocytes to viral spread in a host is unclear. In this study, CD14 monocytes were monitored in 6 macaques until six weeks postinfection (wpi) with SIVmac239 to evaluate their contribution to viral load. The monocyte count in blood significantly increased with peak viremia at 2 wpi and the expression level of CD14 on monocytes significantly decreased at 1-2 wpi, though the number of CD4(+) T cells was stable in these macaques. The number of CD14 monocytes and the expression level of CD14 on monocytes at 2 wpi were also significantly related to the extent of viremia in plasma. An increased number of monocytes at 2 wpi was associated with a lower postacute viral load, suggesting that monocytes have a role in suppressing the virus. The lower expression level of CD14 in monocytes at 2 wpi was associated with a higher viral load and greater degree of infection of monocytes. This correlation suggests that monocytes with a low level of CD14 may be more susceptible to SIV and may enhance viral replication. The analysis of monocytes in persistently infected macaques revealed that the expression level of CD14 was also significantly low during persistent infection compared with naïve macaques, though the monocyte count was within the normal range. Monocytes may suppress viruses, perhaps by their immune function, during acute infection. However, infection of monocytes may increase the viral load and spread viruses in a host."
1704,0.005,1.0000,"This study was conducted to determine the impact of immune activation, cytokine production and apoptosis on the naive CD4+ cell count and the function of hematopoietic progenitor cells during the initial phase of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Blood samples from 11 HIV-infected patients were collected prior to HAART and after 4 and 12 weeks of therapy. Flow cytometry was used to determine the naive CD4+ count and activated T cells. The cloning efficiency of progenitor cells was determined using a colony-forming cells assay. Finally, apoptosis and cytokine production were determined. During the study period, the naive CD4+ count and the cloning efficiency increased significantly. Immune activation was found in HIV-infected patients and decreased during HAART. The level of immune activation correlated negatively with both the naive CD4+ count and the function of progenitor cells. A negative correlation was found between apoptosis and the naive CD4+ count. Alterations in cytokine production during HAART or correlation between cytokine production and the naive CD4+ count or the cloning efficiency of progenitor cells were not detected. In conclusion, immune activation in HIV-infected patients treated with HAART is inversely correlated with the function of progenitor cells and the naive CD4+ count."

During this process HIV incorporates significant quantities of cell surface-derived molecules into its lipid bilayer including human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and lymphocyte function antigen-1. Several studies indicate that virion-bound host-cell-derived molecules are functional and affect the biological properties of HIV-1. Virion-associated HLA class II and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 enhance the infectivity of T-cell line-adapted (TCLA) viruses. No role for virion-associated HLA class I molecules has yet been identified."

Limited radiographic and endoscopic reports have almost uniformly described these lesions as solitary and giant. Over a 28-month period, we identified 68 IEUs endoscopically in 23 patients. Most patients had long-standing HIV infection and a low CD4(+) lymphocyte count. Multiple ulcers were identified in 57% of endoscopies. Giant ulcers were seen in one-third, with 37% < or = 1 cm in greatest dimension. Most of the lesions were in the mild- to distal esophagus. The ulcers were characterized as either shallow or intermediate in depth in 53%, with a deep ulcer in 7%. A ""heaped-up"" appearance of the ulcer was identified in 40%. An esophageal mucosal bridge(s) was seen in two patients. In contrast to previous reports, IEUs are variable endoscopically in number, size, and appearance. Given this lack of uniformity in appearance, which may mimic other causes of esophageal ulceration, all HIV-infected patients with an esophageal ulceration should undergo endoscopy with biopsy to obtain a definitive diagnosis."

Uninfected H9 cells and MNC membranes labelled for CD4, HLA class I and class II, and, at low density, CD11a and CD54; lysosomal structures in the cytoplasm labelled for CD63. The infected cell surface showed immunolabelling for HIV-1 proteins, as did budding particle-like structures. Immunogold labelling of the cell membrane for CD4 was almost non-existent. The level of immunolabelling for CD11a and CD54 on infected cells was greater than that on uninfected cells; this is presumably related to a state of activation during virus synthesis. Budding particle-like structures and free virions in the intercellular space were immunogold-labelled for all host cell markers investigated. This was confirmed by double immunogold labelling using combinations of HIV-1 gag p24 labelling and labelling for the respective host cell molecule. We conclude that virions generated in HIV-1-infected cells concentrate host-derived molecules on their envelope. Also molecules with a prime function in cellular adhesion concentrate on the virion."

Mean CD4+ cell count, serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, 5'-neopterin, and beta 2-microglobulin were significantly lower in acute HIV-1 infection than in EBV infection. Both acute HIV-1 and EBV infections were characterized by significantly higher mean CD8+ cell count and soluble CD8 antigen (sCD8) levels compared to control subjects, while acute HIV-1 infection was accompanied by the highest interferon (IFN)-gamma serum concentrations. In primary HIV-1 infection, significant impairment of CD4+- mediated T-helper function may lead to viral escape and persistence of infection despite an early and vigorous CD8+ T-lymphocyte activation."

We evaluated the results of this program during its first 5 months at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center (Lincoln Hospital) in the Bronx, New York. There were 1,274 total live birth deliveries between August 1 and December 31, 1999. The HIV infection status of 539 mothers (42.3%) was unknown to medical providers in the labor-delivery suite, either due to lack of testing during the current pregnancy or unavailability of HIV documentation at the time of delivery. During labor and delivery, a total of 462 (85.7%) mothers with unknown HIV status consented to expedited HIV testing (Single Use Diagnostic System for HIV-1 antibody or SUDS). The newborns of 77 mothers (14.3%) who did not consent were tested immediately after birth. Seventeen tested positive for HIV-1 antibody by the SUDS test. The results of 10 of these infants (58.8%) were subsequently confirmed positive for HIV-1 antibody by Western Blot analysis. This new rapid HIV testing program facilitated early diagnosis of these previously unknown HIV-exposed infants, although the low positive predictive value of the test in our community calls for careful communication of these results pending confirmation."

Her symptoms resolved when she began corticosteroid therapy and interferon-alpha was stopped. This case report suggests that exogenous interferon-alpha may trigger or contribute to the development of this multisystem granulomatous disorder in which interferon-gamma and CD4 + T-lymphocyte are mainly involved. Patients should be monitored during and following interferon-alpha therapy, since the autoimmune diseases induced by interferon therapy do not always improve after cessation of treatment."

Over the course of 18 months, volunteers screening for research studies in the Opioid Laboratory at the New York State Psychiatric Institute completed a locally developed self-assessment questionnaire. A total of 138 adults with OUD (24 female, 114 male) with a mean age of 46.5 years (SD = 9.5 yrs) were assessed. Significant differences among the four racial/ethnic subgroups (n = 65 African-Americans, n = 34 Hispanics, n = 31 Caucasians or Whites, n = 8 Multiracial) were found. Whites were the youngest (p = 0.001), most frequently injecting drugs (p < 0.001), and engaged more often in risky drug use and sexual behaviors, although their virus transmission knowledge was comparable to that of the other subgroups. Few participants had heard about PrEP. White opioid users showed the most risk behaviors among races/ethnicities, despite comparable prevention knowledge. Better HIV/HCV prevention interventions targeting individuals with opioid use disorders who are not currently in treatment would be desirable, given their large health burden."

The role of HIV-1 in increasing the incidence of other malignancies is more controversial. The incidence of non-Kaposi's sarcoma cancer was examined from 1978 to 1990 among 15,565 homosexual men who participated in studies of hepatitis B virus infection in the late 1970s in New York City, New York, and San Francisco, California. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for all cancers was 1.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-1.8). Excesses were observed for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR = 12.7; 95% CI 11.0-14.6). Hodgkin's disease (SIR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.5-3.9), and anal cancer (SIR = 24.2 95% CI 13.5-39.9). As seen with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer known to be associated with HIV-1. Hodgkin's disease incidence was significantly higher in more recent years compared with earlier years. No cases of Hodgkin's disease were found among HIV-1 antibody-negative men, and Hodgkin's disease was diagnosed near the time of initial acquired immunodeficiency syndrome diagnoses. Anal cancer incidence did not correlate with HIV-1 antibody status and did not tend to occur near the time of AIDS diagnoses. This study confirms the association of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with HIV-1 infect on and suggests an association between Hodgkin's disease and HIV-1 infection. An excess in anal cancer was observed but did not appear to be associated with HIV-1 infection."
8402,0.005,1.0000,"The objectives of this study is to clarify whether there are phases critical for the infection of the central nervous system (CNS) as defined by active viral replication in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. One hundred and nine HIV-1-positive homo- and bisexual patients in early and late disease stages with or without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were included in the cross-sectional, diagnostic (phase I) multicenter study. No patients had any overt neurological deficits; all underwent venous and lumbar puncture as well as neuropsychological testing. In untreated early-stage patients, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral load correlated with inflammatory parameters, but not significantly with neuropsychological abnormalities. CSF viral load and inflammatory reactions were suppressed in HAART-treated early-stage patients. In HAART-treated late-stage patients, there was a weak correlation between CSF viral load and CSF cell count as well as a moderate correlation with immune activation markers and with distinct cerebral deficits independent of CSF viral load. Seventeen of the 109 patients had higher CSF than plasma viral loads and marked inflammatory reactions and immune activation. In patients with greater plasma than CSF viral loads, the factors contributing to cerebral deficits still need to be identified. The results suggest not only that there is an early ""set point"" for CSF/central nervous system (CNS) infection, but also that there is a subgroup of patients in whom intrathecal viral replication correlates with cerebral deficits. Lumbar puncture should be performed in all positive patients to identify members of this subgroup and to ascertain what characteristic factors they have in common in order to improve therapy."

HIV-1-associated dementia is most probably a consequence of HIV-1 infection of the brain rather than of an opportunistic pathogen. The exact mechanism by which the virus causes this disorder, however, is not completely understood. A number of HIV-1 proteins have been shown to be released from HIV-1-infected cells and/or to be present in the extracellular milieu in the HIV-1-infected brain. Moreover, these proteins have been shown to possess neurotoxic and/or neuromodulatory features in vitro.

2266,0.005,1.0000,"Experimental evidence from animal models has provided a framework for our current understanding of autoimmune disease pathogenesis and supports the importance of genetic predisposition, molecular mimicry, and immune dysregulation. However, only recently has evidence emerged to support the role of immune dysregulation in human organ-specific autoimmune disease. In the current study of the ""late"" manifestation of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) in a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients following highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we discuss how immune dysregulation and factors associated with the immunopathology of HIV infection fit the current understanding of autoimmunity and provide a plausible basis for our clinical observations. De novo diagnoses of thyroid disease were identified between 1996 and 2002 in 7 HIV treatment centers (5/7 centers completed the study). Patients were diagnosed as clinical case entities and not discovered through thyroid function test screening. Paired plasma specimens were used to demonstrate sequential rise in thyroid antibodies. Seventeen patients were diagnosed with AITD (median age, 38 yr; 65% were of black African or black Caribbean ethnicity; and 82% were female). The median duration of immune reconstitution was 17 months. Graves disease (GD) was diagnosed in 15 of 17 patients. One patient developed hashithyrotoxicosis with atypically raised C-reactive protein, and another developed hypothyroidism. One GD patient had associated secondary hypoadrenalism. The estimated combined prevalence of GD for 4 treatment centers for female patients was 7/234 and for males was 2/1289. The denominator numbers were matched controls, from 4 centers able to provide data, who commenced HAART during the same time (January 1996 to July 2002) and who did not develop clinical AITD. The mean baseline pre-HAART CD4 count was 67 cells/mL, and the mean increase from nadir to AITD presentation was 355 cells/mL. AITD patients were more likely than controls (95% confidence interval, chi-square test) to be severely compromised at baseline (as defined by a CD4 count < 200 cells/mL or the presence of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]-defining diagnosis), and to experience greater CD4 increments following HAART. AITD may be a late manifestation of immune reconstitution in HIV-positive patients taking HAART, and immune dysregulation may be an important factor."
9366,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia complex is a common and devastating manifestation of the late phases of HIV infection. The pathogenesis of dementia complex is poorly understood and effective treatments have not been developed, in part because of the lack of an appropriate animal model. Mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (scid mice), which accept xenografts without rejection, were intracerebrally inoculated with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and HIV. One to 4 weeks after inoculation, the brains of these mice contained human macrophages (some of which were HIV p24 antigen positive), occasional multinucleated cells, and striking gliosis by immunocytochemical staining. Human macrophages also were frequently positive for tumor necrosis factor type alpha and occasionally for interleukin 1 and VLA-4. Cultures of these brains for HIV were positive. Generally, human macrophages were not present in the brains of control mice, nor was significant gliosis, and HIV was not recovered from mice that received HIV only intracerebrally. Pathologically, this model of HIV encephalitis in scid mice resembles HIV encephalitis in humans and the data suggest that the activation of macrophages by infection with HIV results in their accumulation and persistence in brain and in the development of gliosis. This model of HIV encephalitis should provide insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of this disorder."

The presence of a hemodialysis or transplantation unit may be an additional institutional risk factor. HBV infection was not associated with a history of needle-sticks or contact with known antigen-positive patients.

Follow-up of 151 uninfected partners during a total of 351 person-years of observation showed no sero-conversions, although there were 13 pregnancies during that period. Eighty-seven percent of the seronegative respondents to a detailed questionnaire reported unprotected sexual contact at least occasionally. Among 304 other household members, including 108 parents who helped administer clotting factor concentrates to their children, none was seropositive at entry. Follow-up of 263 showed no seroconversions during a total of 605 person-years of observation. Thus, anti-HIV-1-positive hemophiliacs transmitted to their partners earlier in their course but were not found to do so when prospectively observed. No relationship to level of viremia as indicated by CD4 count, HIV-1 p24 antigenemia, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was found.

This study evaluated the level of exposure to different risk factors associated with HCV transmission and characterized the distribution of HCV genotypes in 356 HIV-1-positive patients in Wuhan, central China. HIV transmission routes were distributed as follows: heterosexual contact, male-to-male sexual contact, intravenous drug use, blood transfusion, and unknown route. HCV antibodies were detected by a third-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HCV-positive plasmas were subjected to RNA extraction, RT-PCR amplification, and sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis characterized HCV subtypes and the evolutionary origin of circulating HCV strains. Ninety-two of 356 (25.8%) patients infected with HIV were anti-HCV-positive. Among co-infected patients, the predominant risk for HCV transmission was intravenous drug use (87.3%). Six HCV subtypes (1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, 3b, and 6a) were detected. HCV genotype 6a was most prevalent, occurring in 39.3% of all patients, followed by genotypes 1b (24.7%), 3b (18.0%), and 3a (9.8%). The least frequent genotypes were 1a (4.9%) and 2a (3.3%). Intravenous drug use was strongly associated with genotype 6a, and infection by blood or blood product transfusion was strongly associated with genotype 1b. Genotype 2a was detected only among those infected by male-to-male sexual contact. The distribution of HCV subtypes suggests that the city plays a crucial role as a hub of HCV transmission in China. Exposure to multiple risk factors associated with HCV transmission was common among patients co-infected with HIV and HCV."

The aetiology and pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in HIV infection is still the subject of intense speculation, and is likely multi-factorial. HIV affects every aspect of the cardiac axis, causing pericarditis, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease and microvascular dysfunction, valvular heart disease, pulmonary vascular disease and pulmonary hypertension, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. HIV-associated vasculopathy is an increasingly recognised clinical entity, causing high morbidity and increasing mortality in southern Africa, particularly from stroke and cardiovascular disease. HIV causes disease of the vascular tree, either by a direct effect on vascular or perivascular tissue, or indirectly via immune complex-mediated mechanisms, associated opportunistic infections and malignancies. As a result, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may have an important role in controlling disease progression. We report a case of histologically defined primary HIV vasculopathy in which the chance to start HAART was initially missed and in which the patient progressed to require bilateral amputations, but obtained disease quiescence upon commencement of HAART."

There was a significant inverse correlation between age and thymic volume (r=-0.415; P=.018), and there was a significant direct correlation between thymic volume and total naive T cell counts (r=0.529; P=.002), naive CD4(+) cell counts (r=0.437; P=.012), naive CD8(+) cell counts (r=0.467; P=.007), and TREC levels (r=0.391; P=.027). In conclusion, this study found clear evidence that the thymus of heavily antiretroviral-treated HIV-1-infected adults with long-term virologic treatment failure is actively engaged in thymopoiesis, which generates new naive T cells for the peripheral lymphocyte pool."

In this study of 87 HIV-1-infected patients experiencing virological failure to second-line regimens containing protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir (viral load >1,000 HIV RNA copies/ml), we observed a low prevalence (3%) of ≥3 darunavir resistance-associated mutations, indicating that this drug may be a good option for third-line antiretroviral therapy in southern India."
8969,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to ART, fundamental to treatment success, has been poorly studied in India. Caregivers of children attending HIV clinics in southern India were interviewed using structured questionnaires. Adherence was assessed using a visual analogue scale representing past-month adherence and treatment interruptions >48 h during the past 3 months. Clinical features, correlates of adherence and HIV-1 viral-load were documented. Based on caregiver reports, 90.9 % of the children were optimally adherent. In multivariable analysis, experiencing ART-related adverse effects was significantly associated with suboptimal adherence (p = 0.01). The proportion of children who experienced virological failure was 16.5 %. Virological failure was not linked to suboptimal adherence. Factors influencing virological failure included running out of medications (p = 0.002) and the child refusing to take medications (p = 0.01). Inclusion of drugs with better safety profiles and improved access to care could further enhance outcomes."

Highly active antiretroviral therapy has decreased the incidence of VL in southern Europe among HIV-1-infected patients, but VL is still observed among patients with low CD4 cell counts, and most coinfected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy experienced relapse, despite initial treatment with liposomal amphotericin B."
13444,0.005,1.0000,"To analyze the profile of HBV-DNA forms in the liver in relation to different levels of virus replication, liver biopsies from 52 chronic HBsAg carriers were studied by Southern blot analysis. Quantitative evaluation of the major HBV-DNA molecules was carried out by densitometry in 27 patients with ongoing hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication in the liver. Significant variations in the intensity of the different bands were noted in individual cases, but statistical correlation between the amount of single stranded forms and levels of serum HBV-DNA was not observed. In contrast, the amount of linear 3.2 kb HBV-DNA appeared to have an inverse correlation with levels of circulating virions. Only the 3.2 kb form was detected in three patients negative for serum HBV-DNA. In these cases with 'inactive' state of episomic HBV genome seroconversion to anti-HBe occurred from 12 months before to 4 months after the time of liver biopsy testing. This 3.2 kb form can therefore be interpreted as a pattern of transition from the replicative to the non-replicative state of the virus."
15197,0.005,1.0000,"This study's hypothesis is that human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients in the inner city (predominantly injection drug users and ethnic minorities) do not take highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as prescribed and that nonadherence leads to virologic failure. A prospective, observational, 3-month study of adherence to HAART was undertaken at an inner-city clinic. There were 40 subjects [110 subject-months]; 30 were male, 10 were female, 75% were Hispanic, 23% were African American, 68% were injection drug users, and 68% were receiving triple therapy. At 3 months, adherence, which was determined by use of the Medication Event Monitoring System (Aprex) was significantly associated with virologic success: lower virus loads were associated with a rate of adherence of >80% (P<.05). Although nonadherence predicted virologic failure, virologic success was not always predicted by adherence: 11 (27.5%) of 40 subjects with suboptimal adherence rates (<90%) had complete virologic suppression."
6333,0.005,1.0000,"The depletion in circulating dendritic cells (DCs) and inverse correlation with viral load have been described in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the DC blood count in antiretroviral-treated patients might be predictive of viral load control independent of CD4+ T cell count. Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and myeloid DCs (mDCs) were enumerated using a newly developed flow cytometric assay based on TruCOUNT. A significant reduction of circulating pDCs and mDCs was detected both in untreated and -treated subjects. The probability of experiencing viral load increase according to pDC, and CD4 count at baseline was evaluated in 39 treated patients. Individuals with lower baseline pDCs were more likely to have an increase of HIV-RNA during the 30 month follow-up in comparison with patients with high pDCs (p <0.001). In particular, the pDC measurement may be useful in the context of a high CD4 count, to distinguish the patients who have virological failure despite high CD4 counts. These findings suggest that in treated patients the enumeration of circulating DCs, especially pDC count, can augment the predictive value of CD4 measurement in predicting virologic failure."
12346,0.005,1.0000,"Long term therapy with antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected patients often result in failure to suppress the virus load. Imperfect adherence to prescribed antiviral drugs is an important factor explaining the resurgence of virus. A better understanding of the factors responsible for the virological failure is important for the development of new treatment strategies. Many complex non-linear models have been developed to describe and simulate the dynamics of HIV-1 virus. Those complicated viral dynamic models have not been used in clinical trials to estimate HIV dynamics parameters, due to their complexity, until the recent development of simplification and approximation techniques. The estimation of the parameters associated with the dynamics from real data has been mostly limited to linearized models that can only explain the decay (suppression) of the virus following antiviral treatment. Moreover, no complete characterization of typical clinical data in terms of inter-subject variability and identification of important covariates effecting HIV-1 dynamics has been attempted. The objective of our paper was to develop a hierarchical non-linear mixed effect model characterizing inter-subject variability in the long-term response to treatment of HIV-1 RNA, and show how the model can be used to quantify the effect of important covariates, such as physiological variables, adherence to treatment or previous exposure to treatment, on the dynamics of HIV-1 RNA. As an example we report the analysis of AIDS clinical trial data from AACTG 398, which shows that patients with previous exposure to treatment show faster death rates for HIV-1, and that higher adherence to treatment is associated with lower reproductive ratio."

All samples were obtained from a study of antiretroviral-associated resistance mutations resulting in virological failure during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Eight (4.7%) patients had the non-B HIV-1 subtype including some circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). All of these individuals acquired the infection by heterosexual transmission. The detection of HIV-1 non-B strains was significantly associated with younger age of HIV-1 acquisition. Our findings indicate, for the first time, the presence of HIV-1 non-B subtypes in Sicily in patients who experienced virological failure during HAART, and highlight the need for implementing a network for the epidemiological surveillance of HIV-1 subtypes in Southern Europe."
4376,0.005,1.0000,"A cross-sectional seroepidemiologic study was carried out on household contacts and sexual partners of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody-positive intravenous drug abusers in Palermo, Italy, in 1985 to evaluate factors that influenced HIV transmission. A total of 43 index cases, 36 spouses or heterosexual partners, 28 children, and 55 adult household members were enrolled. None of the household members without sexual contact, who had shared items and facilities and had interacted with the index cases, contracted HIV infection. However, six of 36 sexual partners had antibodies to HIV. It was observed that the risk of HIV infection was significantly associated with the frequency of sexual intercourse with the seropositive partner. Four children were also found to be infected: two had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex, and the other two were clinically and immunologically normal. Furthermore, one other child had evidence of passive transfer of maternal antibodies. The infection was confined to the younger children (ranging in age from eight months to three years). The data support a high rate of vertical transmission from mother to infant, an intermediate rate of transmission to sexual partners, and no transmission attributable to household contact."
10528,0.005,1.0000,"Inner-city adolescents are believed to be at increased risk for HIV infection because of their high-risk behaviors, and black and Hispanic teenagers may be at greatest risk as a consequence of these behaviors and inadequate AIDS education. In the present paper, the HIV risk status of pregnant Hispanic adolescents presenting for prenatal care to an inner-city municipal outpatient clinic located in New York City was assessed. The assessment consisted of a confidential structured interview. Based on known adult risk factors, adolescents were identified as being at increased risk or low risk. One-third of the 87 teenagers were identified as being at increased risk for HIV infection. Nobody reported symptoms suggestive of AIDS, had had a transfusion, or reported use of intravenous drugs or crack cocaine. Sexual risk-taking behavior was the most common factor that increased HIV risk. Sixteen adolescents were at increased risk solely because of a sexually transmitted disease and seven others reported an STD with at least one other risk factor. Although 86% of the pregnant teenagers reported the risk-taking behavior of substance use by self or partner, only four were at increased risk based on this factor alone. However, many adolescents were unaware of their partners' past substance use and sexual history and, therefore, may have underestimated their own risk. Birthplace (United States vs. foreign born) and nationality (Puerto Rican vs. non-Puerto Rican Hispanic) were significantly associated with the adolescents' HIV risk assessment via an interaction effect. None of the adolescents had previously considered themselves to be at increased risk for HIV infection. The overwhelming majority who were at increased risk declined referral for further counseling or testing. It is recommended that pregnant Hispanic adolescents be assessed for HIV risk and receive risk reduction counseling as part of their general health care."

Blood transfusions (30 patients, 11.5%), illicit drug use (16 patients, 6.2%), homosexuality (five patients, 1.9%), and possible iatrogenic transmission (77 patients, 29.6%) accounted for less than 50% of the cases of hepatitis. Thirty (29.4%) of 102 sexual partners were the most probable source of infection of the patients; three (2.9%) had a history of acute HBV infection two to six months before their partners were admitted to the hospital, and the remaining 27 (26.5%) were characterized as asymptomatic, chronic carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The HBsAg carrier rate was higher in men (47.5%) than women (12.9%) and in unmarried (31.6%) than married (25.3%) sexual partners. Hepatitis B e antigen and abnormal serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase levels were detected more frequently in sexual partners who were HBsAg carriers (29.6% and 48.1%, respectively) than in comparable control partners (2.6% and 5.4%, respectively)."

With increased availability of ART in recent years, achievement of optimal adherence and patient retention are becoming the greatest challenges in the management of HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia. However, few studies have explored factors influencing medication adherence to ART and retention in follow-up care among adult Ethiopian HIV-positive patients, especially in the Amhara region of the country, where almost one-third of the country's ART is prescribed.

6687,0.005,1.0000,"Nineteen children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were treated with recombinant human gamma interferon (rIFN-gamma) (50 microg/m2 subcutaneously three times each week during weeks 1 through 12 and 100 microg/m2 subcutaneously three times each week during weeks 13 through 24) in a phase I/II clinical trial. All children continued to receive previously prescribed therapy with oral zidovudine or didanosine. Children were assessed clinically and with laboratory studies during 24 weeks of study treatment and for 12 weeks after completion of rIFN-gamma therapy. In general, rIFN-gamma therapy was well tolerated. There were two clinical or laboratory adverse events thought to be possibly or probably study drug associated. One child developed acute pancreatitis; another child developed granulocytopenia. Median CD4(+)-lymphocyte counts and plasma HIV RNA concentrations did not change significantly during therapy. In vitro neutrophil bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and superoxide production were not significantly affected by rIFN-gamma therapy. We conclude that rIFN-gamma therapy in HIV-infected children receiving single-agent antiretroviral therapy is safe and does not produce consistent changes in CD4(+)-lymphocyte count, plasma HIV RNA concentration, or in vitro neutrophil function."
8390,0.005,1.0000,"Latinos are more likely to delay HIV testing, present to care with an AIDS defining illness, and die within one year of learning their HIV-positive status than non-Latino blacks and whites. For this paper, we explore the role of partner-relationship characteristics and health behaviors, in predicting HIV testing among Latina adult women who engaged in risky sexual behaviors (i.e., unprotected vaginal and/or anal sex). Data from a convenience sample of 168 Latina adult women who engaged in risky sexual behavior in the year prior to assessment were analyzed for this paper. Rates and predictors of HIV testing among this sample were assessed after a five-year follow-up. Descriptive and analytical estimates include incidence rates and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) from multilevel models. At five-year follow-up, 63.7% (n = 107) women reported having been tested for HIV, of whom 12.2% (n = 13) were women who never tested before. Main reasons for not having been tested at follow-up included: low risk perception (62.1%) and trusting their partner(s)/being in a monogamous relationship/knowing their partner's HIV status (17.2%). Predictors of HIV testing included: age (AOR: 0.96; 95% CI = 0.92-0.99), provider endorsement of HIV testing (AOR: 4.59; 95% CI = 1.77-11.95), poor quality of their romantic relationships (AOR: 1.12; 95% CI = 1.03-1.26), and knowing the HIV sero-status of sexual partner (AOR: 3.61; 95% CI = 1.46-8.95). This study characterizes a group of Latina women at high risk for HIV infection and their HIV testing behaviors. Our findings underscore the need of increasing access to quality health-care services and HIV behavioral interventions, and to strengthen the adherence to HIV/sexually transmitted disease testing recommendations and guidelines among local health-care providers serving the Latino community in South Florida."

18821,0.005,1.0000,"Data were collected from students attending high school in a rural, low acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevalence community in Northern California, and compared with students in an inner-city AIDS epicenter (San Francisco). The findings demonstrate that rural adolescents have higher levels of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) knowledge, especially about risk-reduction strategies. However, rural adolescents also report higher rates of HIV-related sexual risk behaviors. Rural adolescents may not perceive the personal salience of practicing HIV risk-reduction behaviors thus increasing their risk for exposure to sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV infection. School-based HIV prevention programs developed for rural communities will need to enhance the personal salience of HIV for adolescents' and discourage their discounting of personal risk attributable to a lower prevalence of AIDS in the community. Physicians must become more actively involved in HIV prevention efforts by routinely assessing adolescent patient's sexual behavior and utilizing their clinical interaction to provide HIV education and promote the adoption of HIV risk-reduction behaviors."
928,0.005,1.0000,"Persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant public health problem because it is a major cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Roughly one-third of the world population has been infected with HBV and there are about 350 million (5%-6%) persistent carriers. HBV causes 80% of all liver cancer cases and is the second most important carcinogen, after smoking tobacco. There is an approximate 90% risk of becoming a persistent carrier following perinatal infection in infants born to e antigen positive carrier mothers and a 30% risk in pre-school children. Only 5%-10% of adults become persistent carriers following infection. Of individuals persistently infected with HBV, 10%-30% will develop liver cirrhosis and HCC. These highly variable outcomes in both clearance rates and disease outcomes in persistently infected individuals cannot be fully explained by differences in immunological, viral or environmental factors. Thus, differences in host genetic factors may affect the natural history of hepatitis B. "

From 1990 to 1992, a 3-dose hepatitis B vaccination series was introduced into the routine infant immunization schedule in French Polynesia, including a birth dose (BD). In 2014, a nationally representative 2-stage cluster survey was undertaken to evaluate the impact of the vaccination program on HBsAg prevalence among school children (∼6 years of age) in Cours Préparatoire (CP). Documented vaccination data were reviewed for all eligible children; children with consent were tested for HBsAg with a rapid point-of-care test. In total, 1,660 students were identified; 1,567 (94%) had vaccination data for review and 1,196 (72%) participated in the serosurvey. Three-dose vaccination coverage was 98%, while timely BD coverage, defined as a dose administered within 24 hours of life, was 89%. Receipt of the second and third doses was often delayed, with 75% and 55% receiving a second and third dose within 1 month of the recommended age, respectively. No children tested positive for HBsAg. French Polynesia's vaccination program has achieved high coverage and an HBsAg seroprevalence of 0% (0-0.5%) among CP school children, but timeliness of vaccination could be improved."
14463,0.005,1.0000,"Maintaining detectable levels of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in serum after HBsAg sero-conversion is the key clinical endpoint indicative of recovery from infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). As HBV-infected hepatocytes secrete HBsAg subviral particles in vast excess over HBV virions, detectable hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) titres imply complete elimination of HBV virions as well as HBsAg particles. Although intrahepatic phagocytes, for example Kupffer cells, are thought to mediate clearance of HBsAg via antibody (Ab)-dependent and Ab-independent mechanisms, the relative contributions of circulating phagocytic cell types to HBsAg elimination are poorly characterized. Understanding the role of various immune cell subsets in the clearance of HBsAg is important because Ab-dependent or Ab-independent phagocytic HBsAg uptake may modulate presentation of HBsAg-derived epitopes to antigen-specific T cells and hence plays a critical role in adaptive immunity against HBV. This study aims to characterize phagocytic leucocyte subsets capable of internalizing HBsAg immune complexes (HBsAg:IC) or un-complexed HBsAg particles in whole blood directly ex vivo. The data show that uptake of HBsAg:IC occurs most prominently in monocytes, B cells, dendritic cells and in neutrophils. In contrast, B cells, and to a lesser degree also monocytes, seem to be effective phagocytes for un-complexed HBsAg. Importantly, a similar pattern of phagocytic HBsAg uptake was observed in blood from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting that phagocytosis-related cellular functions are not altered in the context of CHB."

This practice transformed HIV from a fatal disease to a more manageable chronic condition. However, relatively few studies focus on the experiences of survivors. This study provided a unique opportunity to interview patients who survived at least 10 years after being treated with ART at GHESKIO. The goal of the study was to elicit from patients their perspectives on what enabled them to survive with AIDS. Grounded Theory, a qualitative research method was used to guide data collection, coding, and analysis. Individual interviews were conducted, audio-taped, transcribed and analyzed in Creole, and translated into English. Data saturation was reached at 25 participants. Of which, 64% were women, the mean age was 49, range of 43-55 years, 24% were married, 44% had not completed elementary school, and 72% had no income, the remaining participants had incomes ranging from $1000 to $5000 annually. Qualitative analysis resulted in 681 codes, which were grouped into six categories: being spiritually grounded, having supportive interactions with providers, caring for children, setting personal goals, persevering and living life as usual, and maintaining strict medication adherence practices. The overarching theory was that having a reason to live despite one's circumstances and living life as usual enabled one to survive. Having a strong spiritual foundation coupled with supportive family and providers motivated participants to live and adhere to their ART. As the number of patients who are living longer with HIV in Haiti increases, results from this study will be important in helping tailor interventions that enhance their overall quality of life."
11350,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can lead to serious liver diseases, including liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, about 85-90% of infected individuals become inactive carriers with sustained biochemical remission and very low risk of LC or HCC. To identify host genetic factors contributing to HBV clearance, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and replication analysis using samples from HBV carriers and spontaneously HBV-resolved Japanese and Korean individuals. Association analysis in the Japanese and Korean data identified the HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 genes with P(meta) = 1.89×10⁻¹² for rs3077 and P(meta) = 9.69×10⁻¹⁰ for rs9277542. We also found that the HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 genes were significantly associated with protective effects against chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in Japanese, Korean and other Asian populations, including Chinese and Thai individuals (P(meta) = 4.40×10⁻¹⁹ for rs3077 and P(meta) = 1.28×10⁻¹⁵ for rs9277542). These results suggest that the associations between the HLA-DP locus and the protective effects against persistent HBV infection and with clearance of HBV were replicated widely in East Asian populations; however, there are no reports of GWAS in Caucasian or African populations. Based on the GWAS in this study, there were no significant SNPs associated with HCC development. To clarify the pathogenesis of CHB and the mechanisms of HBV clearance, further studies are necessary, including functional analyses of the HLA-DP molecule."
1886,0.005,1.0000,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the IL28B gene have been shown to be associated with response to treatment for chronic hepatitis C and also with spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We analysed the association between IL28B genetic variants and spontaneous clearance of HCV infection in 376 HCV-infected Chinese paid plasma donors. Genotyping of eight SNPs near the IL28B region was performed by the iPLEX system (MassARRAY(®) SNP Genotyping; Sequenom) in all donors, and sequencing was performed on all 80 donors who cleared HCV and on 160 of 296 donors who did not clear HCV to validate the genotypes. Eighty (21.3%) donors spontaneously cleared HCV. Four SNPs were significantly associated with spontaneous HCV clearance: rs8099917 TT (vs GT), rs8105790 TT (vs CT), rs12980275 AA (vs AG) and rs10853728 CC (vs CG or GG) with OR (95% CI) 15.27 (2.07-112.50), 14.88 (2.02-109.72), 7.92 (1.88-33.32) and 2.32 (1.22-4.42) respectively. No association between the other four IL28B SNPs including rs12979860 and spontaneous HCV clearance was found. Women had a higher rate of spontaneous HCV clearance than men [56/213 (26.3%) vs 24/163 (14.6%), P = 0.007], and this was true even after stratification for IL28B genotypes with OR of 1.9-2.2 among those with favourable genotypes. Our results confirmed that IL28B polymorphism is associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV in Chinese subjects, but the SNPs that predict HCV clearance in Chinese subjects were different from those reported in Caucasians. Women were more likely to clear HCV infection regardless of IL28B genotypes."

Relatively low titers of anti-HBs developed in only five subjects (23.8%) 1 month after the third dose; all five had T4 cell counts greater than 700 cells/mm and none of the 11 subjects with a T4 cell count below this value responded. Five of the 16 nonresponders to the vaccine later had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex (two) and AIDS (three), while none of the responders did. Our results show that anti-HIV-positive persons are poor responders to the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, and that the absence of a response is an indicator of a more severe immune deficiency and of a poor prognosis. An optimal regimen of hepatitis B vaccination in HIV-infected persons is still to be established."

Infection occurred in 5 out of 76 infants (6.6%) born to 69 viraemic mothers and in none of 29 born to 26 non-viraemic mothers. Only one child was HCV RNA positive one month after birth, while the remaining children became positive at the 3rd to 4th month. HCV genotypes of the babies matched those of their mothers. No difference was found between women who transmitted the virus and those who did not with regard to age, history of drug abuse, HIV infection, ALT abnormal values, HCV genotype, type of delivery, and breast-feeding. Four out of 5 infected infants were born to mothers with IgM anti-HCV (P = 0.04). The mean viral titre in transmitting women (10(7.2)) was higher than in non-transmitting (10(6.5)), and the proportion of mothers with viral load > or = 10(7) was statistically higher in transmitting than non-transmitting women (P = 0.03). These data show that HCV perinatal infection is a rare event and suggest that IgM positivity and high viral load (> or = 10(7)) in the mother are independent variables correlated with HCV transmission (O.R. = 14.5; 95% CI: 1.3-160.7 and O.R. = 16.3; 95% CI: 1.5-179.9, respectively)."

Patients in both groups were previously untreated with oral antiviral agents at enrollment and were treated for at least 24 months (range 24-54). At the 12th and 18th month of treatment, HBV-DNA was negative in 21 (87.5%) and 23 (95.8%) patients with hepatitis B and C and in 20 (83.3%) and 22 (91.6%) in patients with isolated HBV; all patients in both groups were HBV-DNA-negative at month 24 and at subsequent observations. Treatment was well tolerated by all patients in both groups. At the last observation (for co-infected patients, median 44 months and range 24-54; for mono-infected patients, median 40 months and range 24-54), a deterioration in Child class was observed in eight (47%) of 17 patients in patients with both HBV and HCV who were HCV-RNA-positive at baseline, but in none of seven HCV-RNA-negative patients in the same group, and in one patient (4.2%) in the mono-infected patients. Reactivation of HCV infection was relatively infrequent (12.5% of cases) and never associated with a clinical deterioration.

For all these subjects at least two serial samples obtained at the first observation (before HAART) and more than 1 year later, underwent clonal sequence analysis of partial E1/E2 sequences, encompassing the whole HVR1. Evolutionary rates, dated phylogenies and population dynamics were co-estimated by using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, and site specific selection pressures were estimated by maximum likelihood-based methods. The intra-host evolutionary rates of HCV quasispecies was 10 times higher in subjects treated with HAART than in controls without immunodeficiency (1.9 and 2.3 × 10(-3) sub/site/month in group A and B and 0.29 × 10(-3) sub/site/month in group C individuals). The within-host Bayesian Skyline plot analysis showed an exponential growth of the quasispecies populations in immunological responders, coinciding with a peak in CD4 cell counts. On the contrary, quasispecies population remained constant in group B and in group C controls. A significant positive selection pressure was detected in a half of the patients under HAART and in none of the group C controls. Several sites under significant positive selection were described, mainly included in the HVR1. Our data indicate that different forces, in addition to the selection pressure, drive an exceptionally fast evolution of HCV during HAART immune restoration. We hypothesize that an important role is played by the enlargement of the viral replicative space."
6755,0.005,1.0000,"The temporal relationships between plasma human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA levels and evolution of CD4(+) cell counts was studied, using a 2-slope longitudinal mixed model, in 988 patients prospectively enrolled at the initiation of a protease inhibitor--containing regimen of antiretroviral therapy. The short-term slope (baseline through month 4) for mean change in CD4(+) cell count was +21.2 cells/mm(3)/month, and the long-term slope (month 4 through month 24) was +5.5 cells/mm(3)/month. Compared with results from patients without viral response, the long-term slope was 2.5 cells/mm(3)/month higher in patients who had plasma HIV RNA levels of <500 copies/mL at month 4 (P <.001). It was significantly lower after a rebound in plasma HIV RNA level to > or = 500 copies/mL (P <.0001), varied according to plasma HIV RNA level at the time of rebound, and was negative only when the plasma HIV RNA level at rebound was > or = 10,000 copies/mL. If CD4(+) cell counts can remain elevated despite virologic treatment failure, such a discrepant response may be transient in patients who have a high plasma HIV RNA level at the time of treatment failure."
3527,0.005,1.0000,"Most HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis can be treated satisfactorily with standard regimens with expectations of good results. Treatment of tuberculosis in these patients has been complicated by the introduction of HAART, which relies on drugs that interfere with the most potent class of antituberculous medications. Rifampin-free regimens or regimens that employ rifabutin may be acceptable strategies for patients who are receiving protease inhibitors, although these regimens have not been rigorously evaluated in patients with AIDS. At present, there is good reason to believe that a 6-month course of a rifabutin-containing regimen or a 9-12-month course of a regimen of streptomycin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide should be adequate therapy for most patients with drug-susceptible disease. As the treatment of HIV infection with antiretroviral agents evolves, the treatment of tuberculosis in patients with AIDS is likely to evolve as well. This will require careful coordination of antituberculosis and antiretroviral therapies."
12018,0.005,1.0000,"The safety and immunogenicity of a plasma-derived heat-inactivated hepatitis B vaccine (CLB) were evaluated in 471 healthy human volunteers, who, both in their occupations and in their private lives, had been at minimal risk of being infected with hepatitis B virus. The first 202 individuals received three 3-micrograms doses of heat-inactivated hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) at one-month intervals (trial A). A total of 42% one month after the first injection, 84% after two months, and 93% after five months had become anti-HBs (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen) positive. In a second randomized study (trial B), the immunogenicity of five different dosages of the vaccine was compared in 269 volunteers. When the dose of HBsAg was diminished from 3 micrograms to 1.5, 0.6, and 0.25 microgram, no decrease of the anti-HBs response was observed. However, when the dose was diminished to 0.1 microgram of HBsAg, the anti-HBs response dropped significantly to 63% (p less than 0.001). In the recipients of all five vaccine dosages, no influence of sex and age was found on the anti-HBs conversion rates. During the eight-month observation period, none of the vaccinees became HBsAg and/or anti-HBc (antibody to hepatitis B core antigen) positive, and none developed antibodies associated with autoimmune liver disease. No serious side effects were observed."

The modified SCC used was adopted by World Health Organisation (WHO)/International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (IUALTD) for developing countries and also by the Nigerian National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programmed (NTLCP). The regimen used consisted of ethambutol (E), isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R) and pyrazinamide (Z) in the intensive phase of 2 months. The continuation phase was 6 months of ethambutol (E) and isoniazid(H), i.e. 2EHRZ/6EH. Sputum conversion was 90% at the second month of treatment and there was no bacteriological relapse after 18 months of follow-up. Side effects were few and consisted mainly of acne vulgaris in 20 (22.5%) of 89 patients during the continuation phase. It is concluded that this modified 8-month chemotherapy regimen adopted by NTLCP is efficacious in treatment of smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients with background HIV infection."
6557,0.005,1.0000,"A new direct immunofluorescence monoclonal antibody (DFA) method (Genetic Systems, Inc., Seattle, Wash.) for identification of Pneumocystis carinii in induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens was compared in a blinded study with an established Giemsa stain method. We evaluated 148 consecutive clinical specimens from 104 patients with the following results. For the 67 patients (64%) infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 49 were initially negative by both the DFA and the Giemsa methods, none were negative by DFA and positive by Giemsa, 6 were positive by DFA and negative by Giemsa, and 12 were positive by both methods, for a sensitivity and a negative predictive value of greater than 99%. For the six patients positive by DFA and negative by Giemsa, all were positive by both methods on evaluation of subsequently obtained clinical specimens, suggesting a specificity of greater than 99% and a false-positive rate of less than 1%. For 37 patients whose HIV status was negative or unknown, 35 were negative by both methods and 2 were positive by DFA and negative by Giemsa. The DFA method was simple to perform and required less time for scoring of stained slides than the Giemsa method, but care had to be taken to avoid false-positive readings due to extraneous fluorescence. This study indicates that the DFA method represents an advance as a sensitive, simple, and rapid way to identify P. carinii in induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from HIV-infected patients and suggests greater sensitivity of the DFA than the Giemsa method in this patient population."

To determine whether a soluble ActRIIb receptor Fc fusion protein (ActRIIB.Fc), a ligand trap for TGF-β/activin family members including myostatin, can prevent or restore loss of lean body mass and body weight in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected juvenile rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Fourteen pair-housed, juvenile male rhesus macaques were inoculated with SIVmac239 and, 4 wk postinoculation (WPI) treated with intramuscular injections of 10 mg ⋅ kg(-1) ⋅ wk(-1) ActRIIB.Fc or saline placebo. Body weight, lean body mass, SIV titers, and somatometric measurements were assessed monthly for 16 wk. Age-matched SIV-infected rhesus macaques were injected with saline. Intervention groups did not differ at baseline. Gains in lean mass were significantly greater in the ActRIIB.Fc group than in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Administration of ActRIIB.Fc was associated with greater gains in body weight (P = 0.01) and upper arm circumference than placebo. Serum CD4(+) T-lymphocyte counts and SIV copy numbers did not differ between groups. Administration of ActRIIB.Fc was associated with higher muscle expression of myostatin than placebo. ActRIIB.Fc effectively blocked and reversed loss of body weight, lean mass, and fat mass in juvenile SIV-infected rhesus macaques."
6409,0.005,1.0000,"Despite antiretroviral therapy, pneumonias from pathogens such as pneumococcus continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality in HIV-1-infected individuals. Respiratory infections occur despite high CD4 counts and low viral loads; therefore, better understanding of lung immunity and infection predictors is necessary. We tested whether metabolomics, an integrated biosystems approach to molecular fingerprinting, could differentiate such individual characteristics. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf ) was collected from otherwise healthy HIV-1-infected individuals and healthy controls. A liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry method was used to detect metabolites in BALf. Statistical and bioinformatic analyses used false discovery rate (FDR) and orthogonally corrected partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to identify groupwise discriminatory factors as the top 5% of metabolites contributing to 95% separation of HIV-1 and control. We enrolled 24 subjects with HIV-1 (median CD4=432) and 24 controls. A total of 115 accurate mass m/z features from C18 and AE analysis were significantly different between HIV-1 subjects and controls (FDR=0.05). Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed clusters of metabolites, which discriminated the samples according to HIV-1 status (FDR=0.05). Several of these did not match any metabolites in metabolomics databases; mass-to-charge 325.065 ([M+H](+)) was significantly higher (FDR=0.05) in the BAL of HIV-1-infected subjects and matched pyochelin, a siderophore-produced Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Metabolic profiles in BALf differentiated healthy HIV-1-infected subjects and controls. The lack of association with known human metabolites and inclusion of a match to a bacterial metabolite suggest that the differences could reflect the host's lung microbiome and/or be related to subclinical infection in HIV-1-infected patients."

HIV-infected individuals (n = 97) had significantly greater adjusted BMD decline than controls (n = 614) during the first 96 weeks of ART. Subsequently, the rate of BMD decline slowed in HIV-infected individuals but remained greater than the rate of decline in HIV-uninfected individuals at the lumbar spine but not at the hip.

6561,0.005,1.0000,"This nonplacebo-controlled, open label, randomized study was conducted to test the hypotheses that pharmacological doses of nandrolone decanoate would increase lean body tissue, muscle mass, and strength in immunodeficient human immunodeficiency virus-infected men, and that these effects would be enhanced with progressive resistance training (PRT). Thirty human immunodeficiency virus-positive men with fewer than 400 CD4 lymphocytes/mm3 were randomly assigned to receive weekly injections of nandrolone alone or in combination with supervised PRT at 80% of the one-repetition maximum three times weekly for 12 weeks. Total body weight increased significantly in both groups (3.2 +/- 2.7 and 4.0 +/- 2.0 kg, respectively; P < 0.001), with increases due primarily to augmentation of lean tissue. Lean body mass determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry increased significantly more in the PRT group (3.9 +/- 2.3 vs. 5.2 +/- 5.7 kg, respectively; P = 0.03). Body cell mass by bioelectrical impedance analysis increased significantly (P < 0.001) in both groups (2.6 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.8 kg), but to a similar magnitude (P = NS). Significant increases in cross-sectional area by magnetic resonance imaging of total thigh muscles (1538 +/- 767 and 1480 +/- 532 mm2), quadriceps (705 +/- 365 and 717 +/- 288 mm2), and hamstrings (842 +/- 409 and 771 +/- 295 mm2) occurred with both treatment strategies (P < 0.001 for the three muscle areas); these increases were similar in both groups (P = NS). By the one-repetition method, strength increased in both upper and lower body exercises, with gains ranging from 10.3-31% in the nandrolone group and from 14.4-53.0% in the PRT group (P < 0.006 with one exception). Gains in strength were of significantly greater magnitude in the PRT group (P < or = 0.005 for all comparisons), even after correction for lean body mass. Thus, pharmacological doses of nandrolone decanoate yielded significant gains in total weight, lean body mass, body cell mass, muscle size, and strength. The increases in lean body mass and muscular strength were significantly augmented with PRT."
17304,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a threat to hemodialysis patients. Nevertheless, the vaccination rate against this virus is low, perhaps because of the low conversion rate. Although intradermal (ID) vaccination has been proven to be effective (even in patients nonresponsive to intramuscular [IM] vaccination), the duration of immunity was short. The impact of vaccination route and a greater peak antibody (Ab) titer on conversion rate and duration of immunity after ID or IM vaccination was compared in incident hemodialysis patients. Forty-nine patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 5 microgram of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix B; Smith Kline Beecham Pharma Inc, Oakville, ON, Canada) ID every 2 weeks up to either a peak Ab titer of 1,000 IU/L or greater or 52 doses, whereas 48 patients were administered 40 microgram IM at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months. Group demographics were similar. Conversion was achieved in 97.6% of the ID group and 90.5% of the IM group (P: = 0.16). There was no difference between ID and IM groups in time required to convert, peak Ab titer reached, and proportion of patients with a peak Ab titer of 1,000 IU/L or greater. Overall, the duration of immunity was not different after ID or IM vaccination (P = 0.683), and patients in the IM group with a peak Ab titer of 1,000 IU/L or greater had a longer duration of immunity (P = 0.001). In conclusion, a high conversion rate and long duration of immunity against HBV can be achieved cost-effectively in the end-stage renal disease population using the ID or IM route and aiming for an Ab titer exceeding 1,000 IU/L. Based on these data, we provide recommendations for vaccination and surveillance in this population."

At presentation, 18 patients were PPD non-reactors (PPD skin test induration < 2mm), ten patients (20%) had non-cavitary lung disease. The mean CD4 lymphocyte count at presentation was 339/microliters (+/- SD 275). Among patients with abnormal baseline clinical values, the median time to resolution of fever, weight gain of 10%, increase of haemoglobin to 10g/dl and of Karnofsky performance score (KPS) to 80 occurred before sputum smear and culture conversion. Short-term survival was associated with: baseline lymphocytes < 1200/microliters, (Odds ratio (OR) 17.5), CD4+ lymphocytes < 200/microliters (OR 9.8), cavitary lung disease, (OR 0.6), atypical chest radiograph, (OR 6.7), and PPD non-reactivity, (OR 13.5), PPD non-reactivity and non-cavitary disease were associated with significantly lower CD4 lymphocyte counts. Affordable serial measurements parallel the response to therapy and predict survival in HIV-associated PTB."
5845,0.005,1.0000,"To characterize selection factors related to therapy initiation, the authors investigated the extent to which key markers of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease severity were associated with initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART). Logistic regression was used to determine the effects of CD4+ cell count and HIV RNA level on potent ART initiation during 6-month periods among 2,059 HIV-infected US women enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Low CD4+ counts and high HIV RNA levels were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with initiation of potent ART. During all periods between April 1996 and March 1998, CD4+ counts were more strongly associated with potent ART initiation than HIV RNA levels were; however, during the last period, both were associated (odds ratio per 100 CD4+-count decrease = 1.17, p < 0.01; odds ratio per 1 log10 increase in HIV RNA level = 1.48, p < 0.05). For a CD4+ count of 500 cells/ml and an HIV RNA level of 5,000 copies/ml, the probability of potent ART initiation increased from 0.5% to 16.8% between October 1995-March 1996 and October 1997-March 1998, suggesting earlier initiation of potent ART. Given the documented occurrence of confounding by indication, prospectively collected, time-dependent data on markers of disease progression and therapy use should be considered when making population-level comparisons before and after introduction of potent ART."
18736,0.005,1.0000,"The human La (hLa) protein functions in RNA metabolism and is activated by casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can exploit hLa to stabilize its RNA and promote its pathogenesis. To enhance our knowledge of host molecular pathways involved in HBV pathogenesis, a bioinformatic approach was used to generate an expression profile of all predicted target genes of CK2-activated hLa in HBV-infected cells. A computerized literature search was performed to identify English language studies of HBV-, hLa- and CK2-related molecules. The data were pooled and the genes were classified in three functional groups by gene ontology (GO) analysis. HBV, hLa and CK2 targets were predicted, respectively, by a computational method, followed by screening for matching gene symbols in the NCBI human sequences, GO, pathway and network analyses. hLa targets and respective networks in the viral mechanisms of HBV were obtained by the final integrative analysis. Thirty-seven hub genes were identified by overlap calculation, suggesting that hLa may play an important role in the development and progression of HBV through cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, hematopoietic cell lineage, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), antigen processing and presentation, Jak-STAT signalling pathway, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, apoptosis, T-cell receptor signalling pathway, complement and coagulation cascades, protein export and other pathways. Our data may help researchers to predict the molecular mechanisms of hLa in the development and progression of HBV through CK2 comprehensively. Moreover, the present data indicate that hLa targets may be a series of promising candidates for HBV."

8740,0.005,1.0000,"An important aspect of vaccine development involves delivery of antigens to antigen-presenting cells for the induction of potent antigen-specific T lymphocyte responses. We investigated the effect of a cationic liposome, lipofectin, on delivery of whole proteins to human dendritic cells (DCs) derived from blood mononuclear cells by culture in interleukin 4 and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor for stimulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific memory cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. Delivery of HIV-1 Gag, Pol, and Env proteins to DCs by lipofectin stimulated greater anti-HIV-1 memory CTL responses in cells from HIV-1-infected subjects than those induced by DCs loaded with protein alone. The CTLs were CD8+ and HLA class I restricted. Antigen presentation was enhanced by chloroquine, but blocked by brefeldin A and peptide aldehyde inhibitors of proteasomes, indicating that the classic MHC class I cytosolic pathway was used for processing and presentation of HIV-1 protein by the DCs. Stimulation of anti-HIV-1 CTLs by this safe, inexpensive, and broadly applicable approach may be used in DC-based therapies for HIV-1 infection."

Descriptive analysis was performed using SPSS 18.0. From 2011 to 2014, we followed 22 PHIV+ pregnant women. Median age at prenatal entry was 19 years (Interquartile range (IQR) 17.6-21.0); 86% had an AIDS diagnosis; 81% had disclosed their HIV status to partner 11. The median age at HIV diagnosis was 8.3 y (IQR 4.0-13.6), the median age at sexual debut was 16 years (IQR 14-18). At the time of prenatal care initiation, four (18%) were on their first antiretroviral treatment (ART), eight (36%) in their second regimen and nine (41%) in their third regimen or beyond, and one had no data. Seventeen of 22 (77%) had HIV-viral load (VL) > 50 copies/mL at prenatal care entry, 16 had a genotyping exam performed. Seventeen of 22 PHIV+ had VL results near delivery: 7/17 (41%) had VL < 50 copies/mL. Among those who had genotyping at prenatal entry, 11/16 (69%) had mutations associated with ARV resistance. The most frequent major mutations were K103N, M184V, T215, M41L, D67N at reverse transcriptase gene and M46, I54V and V82A at protease gene. No vertical transmissions occurred. Management of pregnancy among PHIV+ is challenging. Individualized ART are needed to achieve viral suppression in a highly ART-exposed subpopulation."

15803,0.005,1.0000,"Although reported rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and related risk behaviours among drug injectors vary considerably throughout the world, and comparison of findings is often hampered by methodological variability among centres. In 1989 the World Health Organization initiated a comparative study of current drug-injecting behaviour and HIV infection using a standardized methodology. Centres were asked to recruit at least half of their samples outside drug treatment settings in order to achieve as representative a group of injectors as possible. Respondents were interviewed using a questionnaire designed by an international working group, and they were asked to provide blood and/or saliva specimens for voluntary testing. Data from 13 centres (Athens, Bangkok, Berlin, Glasgow, London, Madrid, Naples, New York, Rome, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Sydney and Toronto) are reported here. A total of 6,390 injectors were recruited to the study from October 1989 to March 1992, with sample sizes ranging from 85 at Santos (Brazil) to 1,300 in New York. Weekly or daily sharing of injecting equipment was reported by less than a quarter of injectors in all centres. A high proportion of those sharing made some effort to clean equipment before use, although not always by efficient methods. In all centres, the majority of respondents were sexually active; however, rates of unprotected sexual intercourse were high, particularly between regular sexual partners. The overall HIV prevalence rate was 22 per cent, ranging from 0 per cent in Athens to 60 per cent in Santos. Caution should be exercised in postulating a link between HIV prevalence and current risk behaviour, particularly since injectors appear to behave in similar ways across a diverse range of study locations. This is the first report on an international collaborative study for which a large number of injectors were successfully recruited from a variety of settings. The wealth of data now available provides a greater understanding of the social epidemiology of drug injecting, which is essential for the implementation and evaluation of campaigns and interventions designed to limit the spread of HIV infection."

Twelve women (20.6%) were RNA- and 20 (34.4%) E2Ab-positive. Seroprevalence was similar in the IDU and RSB groups and high in RSB partners of IDU men. Five (41.6%) children of RNA-positive mothers were HGV-infected, at a median age of 5 days (range, 1-27), independent of maternal CD4 T lymphocyte numbers, mode of delivery, and HIV-1 transmission; no other child at risk became RNA-positive subsequently. No HGV-infected child (follow-up, 16 months; range, 12-52) showed increased liver enzyme levels; 3 children cleared RNA and E2Ab-seroconverted after 10-48 months. Thus, in HIV-1-infected women, HGV infection is common and also sexually transmitted, and clearance may be impaired. Mother-to-child transmission is frequent and occurs antenatally; children remain long infected without evident disease."

The health-care delivery system depends mostly on nurses for service provision. There were two main purposes of this study: first, to gather descriptive data from major key players (with particular emphasis on nurses) concerning knowledge of the policy process and resource allocation for management and care of clients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Botswana; and, second, to identify nurse characteristics (e.g. position, education, experience, job category) associated with motivation to influence health-care policy in HIV/AIDS management and care in Botswana. A policy process conceptual framework was used to guide data collection and analysis. A case-study research method was used to conduct in-depth interviews from a purposive sample of 19 policy makers, and a survey questionnaire was used to collect data from a purposive sample of 95 registered nurses from six study sites in Botswana. The study findings indicate minimal participation of nurses in health-care policy process and resource allocation. The demographic variable of position was a predictor of the involvement of nurses in policy and in budgetary decisions. Both survey and interview data indicated that this minimal participation of nurses in the policy process resulted in implementation problems, thus compromising service provision. Implications of the findings for the nursing profession, nursing practice and policy, which address the importance of nurses' involvement, are discussed."

The Mantoux tuberculin skin test, which uses purified protein derivative (PPD) of tuberculin, has been used for years as a screening device to detect the presence of exposure and infection to tuberculosis.

The uncertainties in interpreting tuberculin skin tests in immunocompromised individuals is part of the challenge that is being faced by the health-care profession in this 2nd decade of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. This article will help advanced practice nurses understand the relationship between the immune system, tuberculosis, and the PPD skin test; the problem of anergy with immunocompromised patients, particularly those who are HIV-infected; issues involved in placement and interpretation of the results of the PPD test; new Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) standards for PPD interpretation with HIV-infected persons; the ""booster"" effect and two-step PPD testing; concerns regarding bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine; and the use of a critical pathway to aid in rapid identification and isolation of the patient with HIV admitted with a potential diagnosis of tuberculosis versus Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia."

Before a systematic implementation of the policy, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of tuberculosis (TB) record data from 46 clinics in 10 districts to assess baseline HIV testing rates among TB patients. Recorded HIV results from the facility TB register and TB treatment card were reviewed. Of the 1242 TB patients entered in the register, 47% had a recorded HIV result and 84% of these were co-infected with HIV. TB treatment cards were available for 862 (69%) registered patients. Among the 411 (47%) with test results recorded on the treatment card, 341 (83%) were HIV-infected; of these, 12% were reported to be receiving ART."
13741,0.005,1.0000,"The carrier rate for hepatitis B virus (HBV) varies from 1% to 2% to 10% in Asian-Pacific countries. A survey involving 12 transplant centers from 11 countries in this region showed that 1% to 25% of kidney transplant recipients were infected with HBV, and up to 60% of these subjects showed abnormal liver biochemistry. While nearly all centers tested anti-HBs in potential kidney transplant recipients, HBV vaccination of nonimmune subjects was routine in only 66.7%. One-third of the surveyed units rejected HBsAg-positive subjects as kidney donors, while the others demonstrated differing policies in choosing the respective recipients. Two units (16.7%) excluded HBsAg-positive patients from kidney transplantation, whereas the others only excluded those with severe liver disease. Heterogeneity also applies to the immunosuppressive regimens, the use of HBV DNA in serial monitoring, and the timing of antiviral therapy in HBsAg-positive kidney transplant recipients. The data showed that despite HBV infection being a significant problem in kidney transplantation, there is a lack of uniform management policy, attributable to the clinical complexity and deficiency of research data. Although improvement in clinical outcome is likely with the advent of nucleoside analogue therapy and better monitoring, the financial implications in the adoption of these recent advances remain realistic concerns."
17588,0.005,1.0000,The Chinese government has provided health services to those infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) under the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) care policy since 2003. Detailed research on the actual expenditures and costs for providing care to patients with AIDS is needed for future financial planning of AIDS health care services and possible reform of HIV/AIDS-related policy. The purpose of the current study was to determine the actual expenditures and factors influencing costs for untreated AIDS patients in a rural area of China after initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) under the national Free Care Program (China CARES).
5819,0.005,1.0000,"A second-generation surveillance system of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been implemented in Spain. Behavioural and clinical data were collected between 2002 and 2011 through an annual one-day, cross-sectional survey in public hospitals, including all in- and outpatients receiving HIVrelated care on the survey day. Mean age increased over time (from 38.7 years in 2002 to 43.8 years in 2011) and 68.4% of the 7,205 subjects were male. The proportion of migrants increased from 6.1% to 15.9%, while people who inject or used to inject drugs (PWID and Ex-PWID) decreased and men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexuals increased. Unprotected intercourse at last sex increased among MSM and PWID/Ex-PWID. Patients receiving antiretroviral treatment increased significantly from 76.0% to 88.2% as did those with CD4 T-cell counts ≥350 (from 48.2% to 66.9%) and viral copies <200 (from 47.0% to 85.2%). HIV-infected people with hepatitis C virus RNA decreased from 36.0% in 2004 to 29.9% in 2011, while those with HBsAg remained stable at around 4.4%. Implementation of a low-cost, sustainable system for second-generation surveillance in people living with HIV is feasible. In Spain, the information obtained has helped to define and refine public health policy and document treatment effectiveness."
11733,0.005,1.0000,"Dermatomyositis (DM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) with typical cutaneous manifestations. It has been proposed that DM may be caused by autoimmune responses to viral infections, and previous studies have also shown that an association between DM and malignancy. However, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection associated with DM and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rarely encountered. The authors report a case of DM and HCC in a patient with a HBV infection. A 58-year-old man presented erythematous skin rashes on a sun-exposed area of 2 year's duration, and recent proximal muscle weakness. His medical history revealed that he had a chronic HBV infection. A diagnosis of DM relies on proximal muscle weakness, elevated muscle enzymes, myopathic changes (demonstrated by electromyography), muscle biopsy evidence of myositis, and its characteristic cutaneous findings. A Liver mass in the left lobe visualized by abdominal computed tomography was confirmed histologically as HCC. This case suggests that DM associated with HCC might be caused by a HBV infection."
857,0.005,1.0000,"In the fall of 1982, we conducted a serosurvey of 920 of 933 employees in a large residential institution for the mentally retarded in Salem, Oregon. This survey demonstrated an overall prevalence of 10% for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), a marker of present or previous hepatitis B virus infection. Antibody positivity was significantly associated with a history of ever having worked in a position involving direct patient care (adjusted odds ratio = 3.1, 95% confidence interval 2.6-4.2). The length of time employed at the institution was significantly associated with an increasing prevalence of anti-HBc positivity among those persons who had ever worked in direct patient care (chi 2 for linear trend = 19.3, P less than .00001, one tail), but not among those employees who had never worked in patient contact. This evidence supports the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) recommendation of hepatitis B virus screening and, where appropriate, vaccinations for those workers in institutions for the mentally retarded who work closely with patients."
4261,0.005,1.0000,"Five patients infected with immunodeficiency virus who were suffering from chronic polyradiculoneuropathy were investigated during evolution of the disease. Four of them were immunodeficient. The prominent neurological feature was distal and symmetrical weakness of the legs. After 5 months only one patient had improved. All patients had an increased protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid and pleocytosis. Electrodiagnostic studies and sural nerve biopsies indicated demyelination. Sural nerve viral cultures, including human immunodeficiency virus, were negative. The presence of circulating anti-peripheral nerve antibodies and of immunoglobulin deposits in nerve biopsy specimens was investigated by immunofluorescence techniques but failed to demonstrate any immunoreactivity."
2758,0.005,1.0000,The cases of 14 patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura admitted to one institution after 1980 were reviewed. Three of the fourteen cases occurred in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex and one occurred in a patient with probable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The diagnosis in all four cases had been made after 1985. The association of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura with HIV infection was judged to be statistically significant on the basis of the proportion of patients with AIDS among the general population of patients admitted to the same institution during the same period. The fact that this association is only now being recognized suggests that there may be a long incubation period for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or that the association is a rare one recognized now only because of the increased number of persons with AIDS.
9183,0.005,1.0000,"A patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) developed a progressive neuromuscular disorder which included a sensory component, severe weakness and muscle wasting, and fasciculations. At autopsy, there was evidence of severe peripheral neuropathy, as well as widespread cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection within the central and peripheral nervous system. Although the anterior horn cell complement within the spinal cord appeared normal, there was also evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-like immunoreactivity of rare anterior horn cells, as judged by immunohistochemical staining. This patient illustrates the complexity of pathogenetic mechanisms operative in AIDS patients with neuromuscular disease, and suggests that at least some examples of neuromuscular disease in patients with this syndrome may be related to widespread CMV infection of the peripheral nerve (including microvascular endothelial cells) and, more rarely, direct HIV infection of some anterior horn cells."
2460,0.005,1.0000,"Although chronic granulomatous inflammation (CGI) with concomitant caseous necrosis (CN) is a characteristic histological feature of tuberculosis (TB), few studies have investigated its frequency or various pathologic findings. The medical records of 227 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -negative, culture-positive TB patients who underwent biopsy were studied. After the frequency of characteristic pathological findings of TB was determined, a pathologist reanalyzed the pathological findings with particular focus on necrosis and reclassified CGI, CN, or possible CN into possible TB pathologic findings. The initial biopsy interpretation revealed that 63 (34.8%) of 181 patients with pulmonary TB had caseating granulomas, 36 (19.9%) patients had only CGI, and 6 (3.3%) patients had only CN. Among 46 patients with extrapulmonary TB, 16 (34.8%) patients had only caseating granulomas, and 14 (30.4%) patients had only CGI. More patients who underwent percutaneous lung biopsy had CGI or CN (76.3%) than patients who underwent transbronchial lung biopsy (53.6%). The reanalysis confirmed all CN cases identified by the first interpretation, and 20 (95.2%) of 21 non-CN cases were reclassified as possible CN. Ten cases (three pulmonary and seven extrapulmonary) were reclassified as possible TB pathologic findings from just necrosis. Caseating granuloma was present in only one-third of TB cases. Even in cases where only necrosis was identified, CN may be present. "
2125,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence and clinical implications of the Q151M multidrug-resistance mutation gene (mut) to antiretroviral drugs in the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) gene have not yet been fully explained. In the present study three out of 350 (0.85%) of HIV-infected patients who underwent a drug-resistance genotyping assay because of therapeutic failure showed the Q151M mut. All these patients had been previously treated with zidovudine in association with didanosine. One such patient failed to respond to all salvage regimens tried and was shown to harbour some of the characteristic mut associated with Q151M (77L and 116Y). Another two patients partially responded to salvage regimens, both virologically and immunologically, and harboured the M184V mut in the RT gene. The prevalence of Q151M mut in our group was less (0.85%) than in other studies, which ranged from 2 to 19%. The M184V mut seemed to confer some viro-immunological benefit when associated with the Q151M mutation, compared with the latter alone."
8358,0.005,1.0000,"We retrospectively analysed the medical records of patients who underwent renal biopsy in our nephrology department over the past 8 years. Our aim was to discover the frequency of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in patients with primary glomerulonephritis (GN) in Turkey, a moderately endemic country for both infections. The study included 144 male and 104 female patients aged between 12-70 years. The frequency of HBsAg and anti-HCV were found to be similar to healthy controls, respectively 6.5% and 1.6% (p>0.05). As is true for low endemic countries, HBV and HCV infections might be rarely associated with GN in Turkey."
325,0.005,1.0000,"Patients with dual infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and delta virus (HDV) responded poorly to interferon (IFN) therapy. Little is known about the effect of IFN therapy in patients with HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) dual infection. The patients in two randomized controlled trials with chronic HBV infection were retrospectively assayed for HCV markers. The HBV responses to IFN therapy in patients with and without HCV markers were compared. An open trial was conducted in 4 patients who had lost their serum HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) but had continuing HCV viremia and hepatitis. Of the 15 patients seropositive for HCV marker(s), only 1 (6.7%) responded with seroclearance of HBV DNA and HBV e antigen, as compared with 46 (28%) of 164 HCV-negative patients (p = 0.058). Icteric hepatitis developed in 1 patient on emergence of serum HCV RNA in association with seroclearance of HBV DNA. In contrast, good response was demonstrated in 3 of the 4 patients who had lost serum HBsAg before therapy. The results suggest that IFN therapy is not only of limited value in patients with dual infection with HBV and HCV but also has a potential risk of severe hepatitis if the clearance of one virus removes its suppressive effect on and facilitates the emergence of the other. However, patients with continuing HCV hepatitis after termination of the chronic HBsAg carrier state responded well to IFN therapy."
5829,0.005,1.0000,"To determine the effect of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection upon pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a laparoscopic study of acute PID was conducted in Nairobi, Kenya. Subjects underwent diagnostic laparoscopy, HIV-1 serology, and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Of the 133 women with laparoscopically verified salpingitis, 52 (39%) were HIV-1-seropositive. Tubo-ovarian abscesses (TOA) were found in 33% of HIV-1-infected and 15% of HIV-1-uninfected women (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-6.5). Among seropositive women, TOA was found in 55% of those with CD4 cell percent <14% vs. 28% with CD4 cell percent>14% (OR 3.1, 95% CI 0.6-15.3). Neisseria gonorrhoeae was detected in 37 women (28%) and Chlamydia trachomatis in 12 (9%); neither was significantly related to HIV-1 seropositivity. Length of hospitalization was not affected by HIV-1 serostatus overall but was prolonged among HIV-1-infected women with CD4 cell percent <14%. Among patients with acute salpingitis, likelihood of TOA was related to HIV-1 infection and advanced immunosuppression. In general, HIV-1-seropositive women with acute salpingitis responded well to treatment."
18949,0.005,1.0000,"In order to assess the frequency of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in a high risk population, 32 women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with no AIDS-related symptoms, underwent colposcopic, cytologic and histologic examinations of the uterine cervix. In seven cases (21.9%) cervical smears showed dysplasia and in nine cases (28.1%) histologic evaluation indicated CIN. No invasive carcinomas were observed. In seven of the nine women CIN was associated with lesions due to human papillomavirus infection (HPV). These data confirm that HIV-positive women are at increased risk for developing neoplasias in the lower genital tract and are in need of regular and careful cytologic and, in particular, colposcopic and histologic examinations."
9903,0.005,1.0000,"Antiviral treatment can be complex in decompensated hepatitis B virus (HBV) cirrhosis because of potential emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutants and worsening liver function, and to multifactorial nephrotoxicity. Negative HBV-DNA status by hybridization before liver transplantation is a favorable prognostic factor. We present the case of a 54-year-old HBV+ liver transplantation candidate who, after testing negative for HBV-DNA, developed YMDD lamivudine-resistant mutants resulting in a deteriorated clinical condition. After 8 months of adefovir plus lamivudine double therapy, only partial response was achieved. Tenofovir was added to this regimen, and an early decline of HBV-DNA was seen at 4 weeks without adverse events. The patient underwent transplantation. At 21-month postoperative follow-up, the patient's outcome was excellent. Post-transplantation HBV prophylaxis, taking into account the prior development of mutants, consists of hepatitis B immunoglobulin plus lamivudine and adefovir. Tenofovir was well tolerated and produced a fast antiviral response, suggesting its potential value in combined antiviral treatment for liver transplantation candidates."
12451,0.005,1.0000,"Vaccination for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) remains an elusive goal. Whether an unsuccessful vaccine might not only fail to provoke detectable immune responses but also could actually interfere with subsequent natural immunity upon HIV-1 infection is unknown. We performed detailed assessment of an HIV-1 gag DNA vaccine recipient (subject 00015) who was previously uninfected but sustained HIV-1 infection before completing a vaccination trial and another contemporaneously acutely infected individual (subject 00016) with the same strain of HIV-1. Subject 00015 received the vaccine at weeks 0, 4, and 8 and was found to have been acutely HIV-1 infected around the time of the third vaccination. Subject 00016 was a previously HIV-1-seronegative sexual contact who had symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection approximately 2 weeks earlier than subject 00015 and demonstrated subsequent seroconversion. Both individuals reached an unusually low level of chronic viremia (<1,000 copies/ml) without treatment. Subject 00015 had no detectable HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses until a borderline response was noted at the time of the third vaccination. The magnitude and breadth of Gag-specific CTL responses in subject 00015 were similar to those of subject 00016 during early chronic infection. Viral sequences from gag, pol, and nef confirmed the common source of HIV-1 between these individuals. The diversity and divergence of sequences in subjects 00015 and 00016 were similar, indicating similar immune pressure on these proteins (including Gag). As a whole, the data suggested that while the gag DNA vaccine did not prime detectable early CTL responses in subject 00015, vaccination did not appreciably impair his ability to contain viremia at levels similar to those in subject 00016."
1812,0.005,1.0000,"India's National AIDS Control Organization provides free antiretroviral treatment (ART) to people living with HIV (PLHIV), including members of marginalized groups such as injecting drug users (IDUs). To help inform development of interventions to enhance ART access, we explored barriers to free ART access at government ART centers for IDUs living with HIV in Chennai by conducting three focus groups (n = 19 IDUs) and four key informant interviews. Data were explored using framework analysis to identify categories and derive themes. We found interrelated barriers at the family and social, health-care system, and individual levels. Family and social level barriers included lack of family support and fear of societal discrimination, as well as unmet basic needs, including food and shelter. Health-care system barriers included actual or perceived unfriendly hospital environment and procedures such as requiring proof of address and identity from PLHIV, including homeless IDUs; provider perception that IDUs will not adhere to ART, resulting in ART not being initiated; actual or perceived inadequate counseling services and lack of confidentiality; and lack of effective linkages between ART centers, needle/syringe programs, and drug dependence treatment centers. Individual-level barriers included active drug use, lack of self-efficacy in ART adherence, low motivation to initiate ART stemming from a fatalistic attitude, and inadequate knowledge about ART. These findings indicate that to facilitate IDUs gaining access to ART, systemic changes are needed, including steps to make the environment and procedures at government ART centers more IDU-friendly and steps to decrease HIV- and drug use-related stigma and discrimination faced by IDUs from the general public and health-care providers. Housing support for homeless IDUs and linkage of IDUs with drug dependence treatment are also essential."
16148,0.005,1.0000,"Individuals who are homozygous for the 32-bp deletion in the gene coding for the chemokine receptor and major human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor CCR5 (CCR5 -/-) lack functional cell surface CCR5 molecules and are relatively resistant to HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 infection in CCR5 -/- individuals, although rare, has been increasingly documented. We now report that the viral quasispecies from one such individual throughout disease is homogenous, T cell line tropic, and phenotypically syncytium inducing (SI); exclusively uses CXCR4; and replicates well in CCR5 -/- primary T cells. The recently discovered coreceptors BOB and Bonzo are not used. Although early and persistent SI variants have been described in longitudinal studies, this is the first demonstration of exclusive and persistent CXCR4 usage. With the caveat that the earliest viruses available from this subject were from approximately 4 years following primary infection, these data suggest that HIV-1 infection can be mediated and persistently maintained by viruses which exclusively utilize CXCR4. The lack of evolution toward the available minor coreceptors in this subject underscores the dominant biological roles of the major coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4. This and two similar subjects (R. Biti, R. Ffrench, J. Young, B. Bennetts, G. Stewart, and T. Liang, Nat. Med. 3:252-253, 1997; I. Theodoreu, L. Meyer, M. Magierowska, C. Katlama, and C. Rouzioux, Lancet 349:1219-1220, 1997) showed relatively rapid CD4+ T-cell declines despite average or low initial viral RNA load. Since viruses which use CXCR4 exclusively cannot infect macrophages, these data have implications for the relative infection of the T-cell compartment versus the macrophage compartment in vivo and for the development of CCR5-based therapeutics."
15374,0.005,1.0000,"It has been hypothesized that protection against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection may result from either acquired host immunity, inheritance of a dysfunctional CCR5 HIV-1 coreceptor, or a low or attenuated virus inoculum. Thirty-seven HIV-1-uninfected persons engaging in repeated high-risk sexual activity with an HIV-1-infected partner were prospectively studied to determine the contribution of these factors in protecting against HIV-1 transmission. More than one-third (13/36) demonstrated HIV-1-specific cytotoxicity, and this activity significantly correlated with the wild type CCR5 genotype (P=.03). Only 1 subject (3%) demonstrated the homozygous CCR5 32-bp deletion (Delta32/Delta32). Median plasma HIV-1 RNA levels from 18 HIV-1-infected sex partners were not statistically different from those of matched infected control patients. These results indicate that inheritance of the Delta32 CCR5 mutation does not account for the majority of persistently HIV-1-resistant cases, and the presence of cellular immunity in these persons suggests either undetected infection or protective immunity."
1864,0.005,1.0000,"Antigen-specific immunity is crucially important for containing viral replication in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected hosts. Several epitopes have been predicted for the early expressed HIV-1 proteins Tat and Rev, but few have been studied in detail. We characterized the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B44-restricted Rev epitope EELLKTVRL (EL9) in an HIV-1-infected subject treated with antiretroviral therapy. Interestingly, a high sequence similarity was found between the EL9 epitope and the human nucleolar protein 6 (NOL6). However, this similarity does not seem to impede immunogenicity as CD8(+)  T-cells, previously stimulated with EL9-pulsed dendritic cells, were able to specifically recognize the HIV-1 Rev epitope without cross-recognizing the human self-antigen NOL6. After the subject interrupted antiretroviral therapy and virus rebounded, mutations within the EL9 epitope were identified. Although the emerging mutations resulted in decreased or abolished T-cell recognition, they did not impair Rev protein function. Mutations leading to escape from T-cell recognition persisted for up to 124 weeks following treatment interruption. This study shows that the HLA-B44-restricted Rev CD8(+)  T-cell epitope EL9 is immunogenic notwithstanding its close resemblance to a human peptide. The epitope mutates as a consequence of dynamic interaction between T-cells and HIV-1. Clinical status, CD4(+)  T-cell count and viral load remained stable despite escape from T-cell recognition."
4499,0.005,1.0000,"The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a virus culture technique were used to detect human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells and infectious virus in cell-free CSF, respectively, of 28 HIV-1 seropositive homosexual men. Provirus was detected in 24 patients of whom 15 were also culture positive. One subject was virus culture positive but not PCR positive. Two asymptomatic HIV-1 seropositive persons and one individual with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy were negative by both techniques. All of four patients with overt neurological symptoms, but also 20 of 24 patients without such symptoms were PCR positive. The data indicate that viral replication is common, and that the vast majority of HIV-1-infected individuals harbor the virus DNA in CSF, during all stages of infection."
14225,0.005,1.0000,"With efforts underway to develop a preventive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine, it remains unclear which immune responses are sufficient to protect against infection and whether prior HIV-1 immunity can alter the subsequent course of HIV-1 infection. We investigated these issues in the context of a volunteer who received six HIV-1LAI envelope immunizations and 10 weeks thereafter acquired HIV-1 infection through a high-risk sexual exposure. In contrast to nonvaccinated acutely infected individuals, anamnestic HIV-1-specific B- and T-cell responses appeared within 3 weeks in this individual, and neutralizing antibody preceded CD8+ cytotoxic responses. Despite an asymptomatic course and an initial low level of detectable infectious virus, a progressive CD4+ cell decline and dysfunction occurred within 2 years. Although vaccination elicited immunity to HIV-1 envelope, which was recalled upon HIV-1 exposure, it was insufficient to prevent infection and subsequent immunodeficiency."
12616,0.005,1.0000,"Candidate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccines designed to elicit T-cell immunity in HIV-1-uninfected persons are under investigation in phase I to III clinical trials. Little is known about how these vaccines impact the immunologic response postinfection in persons who break through despite vaccination. Here, we describe the first comprehensive characterization of HIV-specific T-cell immunity in vaccine study participants following breakthrough HIV-1 infection in comparison to 16 nonvaccinated subjects with primary HIV-1 infection. Whereas none of the 16 breakthrough infections possessed vaccine-induced HIV-1-specific T-cell responses preinfection, 85% of vaccinees and 86% of nonvaccinees with primary HIV-1 infection developed HIV-specific T-cell responses postinfection. Breakthrough subjects' T cells recognized 43 unique HIV-1 T-cell epitopes, of which 8 are newly described, and 25% were present in the vaccine. The frequencies of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-secreting cells recognizing epitopes within gene products that were and were not encoded by the vaccine were not different (P = 0.64), which suggests that responses were not anamnestic. Epitopes within Nef and Gag proteins were the most commonly recognized in both vaccinated and nonvaccinated infected subjects. One individual controlled viral replication without antiretroviral therapy and, notably, mounted a novel HIV-specific HLA-C14-restricted Gag LYNTVATL-specific T-cell response. Longitudinally, HIV-specific T cells in this individual were able to secrete IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha, as well as proliferate and degranulate in response to their cognate antigenic peptides up to 5 years postinfection. In conclusion, a vaccinee's ability to mount an HIV-specific T-cell response postinfection is not compromised by previous immunization, since the CD8+ T-cell responses postinfection are similar to those seen in vaccine-naïve individuals. Finding an individual who is controlling infection highlights the importance of comprehensive studies of breakthrough infections in vaccine trials to determine whether host genetics/immune responses and/or viral characteristics are responsible for controlling viral replication."
19144,0.005,1.0000,"Herpesvirus infections are among the most common and debilitating opportunistic infections in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and they may have atypical clinical features. We describe the cases of three patients with AIDS in whom atypical persistent ulcerative skin lesions developed as a result of varicella-zoster virus infection. Two patients had disseminated infection without a vesicular stage; one patient had underlying asteatotic eczema. All responded well to acyclovir. One patient was treated with azidothymidine, and typical dermatomal herpes zoster subsequently developed. The profound loss of helper T cell function in AIDS may lead to multiple abnormalities in local immune response to cutaneous herpesvirus infections and may be responsible for the atypical morphology and a prolonged course."

In five, HIV positivity on serologic testing was first found when tuberculosis was diagnosed. The mean CD4 cell count was 37.3 +/- 29.6/microliters. Results of tuberculin skin tests were negative in 5 patients. One patient had pulmonary tuberculosis and 5 had miliary tuberculosis. Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy was found on chest X-ray films in 4 patients and superficial lymphadenopathy was found in all patients. All patients had positive mycobacterial cultures of sputum and 2 patients had positive tests for acid-fast bacilli on smears of lymph-node aspirates. In one patient with tuberculosis meningitis, a culture of cerebrospinal fluid for acid-fast bacilli was positive. Epithelioid cell granulomas were found in samples of lung, liver, and bone marrow from 4 patients. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated from all patients, and was not resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, or streptomycin.

7235,0.005,1.0000,"After the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 1996 the neurological manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)-infection did not decline in incidence and prevalence like the other complications of immunodeficiency; in contrast, due to the longer survival times of HAART treated HIV-1-positive individuals, prevalence of virus associated neurological disease increased during the last years, as international studies underline. Therefore, clinicians and HIV-therapists should be able to diagnose HIV-1-associated neurological disease even in early stages. This article describes symptoms and signs, neuro-imaging and cerebrospinal fluid findings as well as therapy options in primary HIV-1-associated neurological disease like encephalo- and myelopathy and polyneuropathy. Furthermore, those opportunistic infections, caused by bacteria, viruses other than HIV and parasites emerging with manifest immunodeficiency and remaining to be relevant in the HAART era are presented from diagnostic, differential-diagnostic and therapeutic points of view.

Quantitative image-analytic techniques were used to estimate volumes of ventricular and cortical cerebrospinal fluid, cerebral white matter, and cortical and subcortical gray matter structures. Relative to low-risk group control subjects and asymptomatic HIV-positive subjects, nondemented but medically symptomatic HIV-positive subjects showed significant increases in cerebrospinal fluid, reduced volume of cerebral white matter, and reduced cerebral gray matter volumes. Unexpectedly, however, some cerebrospinal fluid increases and gray matter volume decreases were present in the seronegative high-risk control subjects as well."
17054,0.005,1.0000,"In infants, the major components of the innate immune system appear weakened, and it has been shown that both polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) production and function are immature. This study was conducted to assess the expression of a number of receptors important to normal PMN function and the integrity of PMN degranulation in cord blood and in uninfected children of varying ages born to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seropositive mothers. Although the expression of l-selectin (CD62L) on PMN did not differ between the infants aged 12, 15 and 18 months, the expression of the interleukin-8 (IL-8) receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2, and the complement 5a (C5a) receptor CD88 displayed a similar pattern, with the highest levels expressed on PMN from infants in the 12 month old age group, and declining with age. It was also observed that PMN from a substantial proportion of the younger infants were unresponsive to a variety of stimuli including IL-8, C5a, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1alpha, SDF-1beta, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), with the proportions of children showing positive (adult-like) PMN degranulation responses increasing with age. Exposure to HIV-1 did not appear to be the cause of impaired degranulation responses, since a similar proportion of cord blood PMN from uninfected infants born to HIV-1 infected and HIV-1 uninfected mothers were unresponsive. The altered expression of these important receptors and inefficient agonist-induced degranulation in early life may contribute to the increased susceptibility of infants to secondary microbial infections."
19570,0.005,1.0000,"This study reports on four empirical models likely to contribute to understanding the behaviors linked with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among intravenous drug users. The sample comprises 1,637 intravenous drug users recruited between May 1989 and June 1990 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Adjusting for sociodemographics, four logistic regression models were constructed to assess the association of risk behaviors with HIV seropositivity. In model 1, the variables found to be significantly associated with HIV seropositivity were injecting four times a day, injection as the only route of consuming drugs, and years of injection. In model 2, the only risk behavior significantly associated with HIV seropositivity was injecting drugs in shooting galleries. In model 3, all sex risk variables failed to meet the adjusted level of significance. In model 4, pneumonia, hepatitis, and syphilis were significantly linked with HIV infection. In order to assess the individual effects of the significant variables in each one of the four models, a logistic regression analysis was performed simultaneously controlling for all of the variables. After adjustment for the Bonferroni correction, age group 25-34 years, injection as the only route of using drugs, number of years of injection, and syphilis were the only significant variables remaining."
12503,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death (1). Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major risk factor for HCC, accounting for more than one half of cases worldwide (2). Early detection of HCC in populations with chronic HBV infection through surveillance methods is critically important in providing definitive treatment for HCC and has a major impact on patient outcomes (3), including a survival benefit as demonstrated in one prospective randomised controlled trial (4). Efforts to identify populations and individuals with HBV infection who are at high risk may contribute to the development of surveillance strategies with the greatest impact on patient outcomes; however, the implementation of an individualised approach to surveillance can be challenging. This Perspective aims to explore risk factors associated with HCC in patients with chronic HBV infection, recent data on developing scoring systems to assess risk, and how these may impact surveillance strategies."
6324,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are the major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We examined trends in the incidence of HCC among a population-based cohort of people infected with HBV or HCV. HBV and HCV cases notified to the New South Wales Health Department between 1992 and 2007 were linked to the Central Cancer Registry, Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and National HIV/AIDS Registries. Crude HCC incidence rates were estimated using person-time methodology. Age-standardized incidence rates were calculated using the 2001 Australian population. Trends in incidence were examined using join point regression models. Between 1992 and 2007, 1201 people had a linked HCC record: 556 of those with HBV; 592 with HCV; 45 with HBV/HCV co-infection; and 8 with HIV co-infection. The overall age-standardized HCC incidence rates declined non-significantly from 148.0 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 63.7, 287.4) per 100,000 population in 1995 to 101.2 (95% CI 67.3, 144.6) in 2007 among the HBV monoinfected group and significantly from 151.8 (95% CI 62.4, 299.8) per 100,000 population to 75.3 (95% CI 50.8, 105.5) among the HCV monoinfected group. However, incidence rates in the HCV monoinfected group progressively increased from the period 1992-1997 to 2004-2007 when adjusted for age, sex, and birth cohort, and the total number of cases per annum continued to increase. Despite declines in the age-adjusted incidence rates of HCC over time, the absolute number of cases increased likely due to the ageing cohort and an increasing prevalence of both hepatitis B and C in Australia."
905,0.005,1.0000,"We investigated the effects of early human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection (HIV-1) on CD4- and CD28-mediated co-signaling of the T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). CD4 ligation either alone or in conjunction with TCR occupancy resulted in abrogated signaling shown by impaired co-association of the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 with the CD3-zeta chains in virally infected PBL. In addition, down-regulation of CD4-associated TCR signaling resulted in diminished tyrosine phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), a serine threonine kinase which is critically involved in the regulation of transcription factors. Furthermore, these aberrant CD4-driven signals rendered HIV-1-infected PBL susceptible to activation-induced cell death. By contrast, cross-linking of the TCR/CD3 complex with the CD28 receptor improved tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK and salvaged infected PBL from activation-induced cell death. Our data demonstrate the importance of appropriate CD3, CD4 and CD28 co-stimulatory function to prevent apoptosis. The CD4-mediated signaling defects of the TCR could contribute to the loss of immunocompetent cells during HIV-1 infection via activation-induced cell death, whereas stimulation through the CD28 pathway could reverse these detrimental effects."

11574,0.005,1.0000,"We prospectively examined whether the complexity of hepatitis C virus (HCV) quasispecies is related to the response to interferon (IFN) therapy. Among 64 patients who had histologically proven chronic hepatitis and were treated with natural IFN-alpha, 53 patients were analysed. The other 11 patients discontinued therapy because of adverse effects of IFN. The complexity of the hypervariable region 1 (HVR 1) in quasispecies was determined using both clone number determined by fluorescence single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and nucleotide diversity determined by direct sequencing. These parameters were measured not only before treatment but also at completion and 6 months after therapy, if serum HCV RNA was detectable. This population of patients was different from the general Japanese population with regard to the high prevalence of patients infected with genotype 2a or 2b (49%), who had a higher viral load than those with genotype 1b (P = 0.021). Twenty-two patients (41.5%) were sustained responders. Genotype non-1b (P = 0.0009) and a smaller clone number (P = 0.008) were significantly associated with a sustained response. In multivariate analysis, these variables were independently associated with a sustained response (i.e. genotype: odds ratio 6.84, 95% CI 1.84-30. 12; and clone number: odds ratio 1.26, 95% CI 0.99-1.68). The clone number and nucleotide diversity did not change significantly between pretreatment and at completion or 6 months after therapy. These results suggest that lower complexity of HVR 1 quasispecies predicts a preferable response to IFN therapy that is independent of viral load, especially in the population of the relatively high prevalence of patients infected with genotype 2."
11376,0.005,1.0000,"In this study, we assessed the prevalence of overt and occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among leukemia patients. Among 256 leukemia patients and 377 fracture patients (control group), we found that the hepatitis B surface-antigen-positive rate was greater in leukemia patients than in the controls (odds ratio, 2.08; p = 0.01). Moreover, the prevalence of occult HBV infection was higher in leukemia patients than in the controls (10.5 % vs. 2.9 %; odds ratio, 3.92; p < 0.001). The HBV genotype distribution differed significantly between the leukemia and chronic hepatitis B or control groups (p < 0.001 and 0.01, respectively); specifically, genotype C was primarily observed in occult HBV infection patients with leukemia. The stop codon mutation rate or amino acid substitutions in the major hydrophilic region did not differ between the groups. Thus, the prevalence of occult hepatitis B is higher in leukemia patients, and the HBV genotype distribution differs between patients with leukemia and chronic hepatitis B virus infection."

Demographic, virological, biochemical, and genetic characteristics of each patient were investigated. Liver fibrosis was assessed by transient elastometry. Mean age of the patients (72.9 % males, 27.1 % females) is 50 years. 91.5 % % of patients are Caucasian, 8.5 % African. In the patients with HCV1 and HCV4 a higher frequency of IL28B CT is observed with a prevalence of 52.1 and 61.8 % respectively. As regards ethnic group, African people have a prevalence of 35.5 % for CC, while Caucasians have a prevalence of 23.8 % for CC. In our cohort, IL28B polymorphism does not show significant differences among ethnic groups and in HCV1 and HCV4 genotypes. As described in literature, IL28B CC genotype is confirmed as predictor of sustained virological response in both Caucasians and Africans. A significant correlation between liver fibrosis and IL28B polymorphism emerges."
13871,0.005,1.0000,"Genetic polymorphisms of the interleukin 28B (IL28B) locus are associated closely with outcomes of pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between IL28B polymorphism and responses to therapy in patients infected with genotype 2. One hundred twenty-nine chronic hepatitis C patients infected with genotype 2, 77 patients with genotype 2a and 52 patients with genotype 2b, were analyzed. Clinical and laboratory parameters, including genetic variation near the IL28B gene (rs8099917), were assessed. Drug adherence was monitored in each patient. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses of these parameters and clinical responses were carried out. Univariate analyses showed that a sustained virological response was correlated significantly with IL28B polymorphism, as well as age, white blood cell and neutrophil counts, adherence to RBV, and rapid virological response. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients infected with genotype 2b achieved significantly lower rapid virological response rates than those with genotype 2a. Patients with the IL28B-major allele showed higher virus clearance rates at each time point than those with the IL28B-minor allele, and the differences were more profound in patients infected with genotype 2b than those with genotype 2a. Furthermore, both rapid and sustained virological responses were associated significantly with IL28B alleles in patients with genotype 2b. IL28B polymorphism was predictive of PEG-IFN plus RBV combination treatment outcomes in patients infected with genotype 2 and, especially, with genotype 2b. In conclusion, IL-28B polymorphism affects responses to PEG-IFN-based treatment in difficult-to-treat HCV patients."
4453,0.005,1.0000,"Approximately one-third of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are concomitantly infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). As a result, liver disease remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in HIV patients. Prior to 2011, treatments of HCV lacked efficacy in clinical trials in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Fortunately, several direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have now entered clinical practice and others have reached advanced stages of clinical development. These therapies offer significant benefits such as improved rates of sustained virologic response (SVR), shortened durations of treatment, and compatibility with HIV antiretroviral therapies. Treatments such as sofosbuvir (SOF) have received approval for HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Moreover, interferon-free options exist for HIV/HCV co-infected patients who may be ineligible or intolerant of interferon. Despite these improvements, physicians must be aware of the differences between these DAAs, the patient characteristics that play a role on the effectiveness of these medications, and the drug-drug interactions these DAAs may have with existing HIV antiretroviral therapies. The aim of this review is to discuss the prevalence and incidence of HIV/HCV co-infection, critical factors related to patient evaluation, current treatment options, and new developments in the management of HIV/HCV co-infected patients.

The sustained virologic response(SVR), defined as HCV RNA negativiation at 24 weeks after the treatment, were obtained 50% among the patients with genotype 1 (48 weeks treatment) and 80% among those with genotype 2 (24 weeks treatment) in Peg-IFN plus RBV combination therapy. The baseline host factors such as age, the degree of liver fibrosis progression and a genetic polymorphism near the IL28B gene, the viral factors such as HCV genotype, mutant virus at HCV core region and interferon sensitivity determining region, the treatment factors such as drug adherence and treatment duration have been reported to be associated with SVR. The risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence was significantly lower in SVR patients than non-SVR patients. Especially, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels decreased through therapy, and the patients with < 5 ng/mL had a low potential of HCC incidence regardless of HCV eradication. It is suggested that AFP levels at 24 weeks after the treatment can be a good surrogate marker for HCC incidence irrespective of the virologic response."

Four hundred fifty-four Asian-American HBeAg-positive HBV carriers, followed for 1-10 years, were tested approximately every 6 months for HBeAg. Patients with alanine aminotransferase levels > or = 50 IU/mL at entry had 1067.3 seroconversions/10(5) person-months in the 5- to 19-year age group, 1753.3 in the 20- to 34-year group, and 1257.2 in the 35- to 50-year group. Published data indicate that 30% of children and 33% of adults seroconvert during interferon-alpha treatment and follow-up. In our study population, spontaneous seroconversion occurred in 15% of children (95% confidence interval [CI], 8%-27%), 23% of adults 20-34 years (95% CI, 15%-34%), and 17% of adults 35-50 years (95% CI, 10%-28%) during the same interval. The high rate of spontaneous seroconversion should be weighed in decisions to treat HBV carriers with interferon-alpha."

IDUs were enrolled in 23 semiannual cross-sections from three community sites. For identification of recent infections, less sensitive enzyme immunoassay testing was performed on stored specimens that had previously tested positive for HIV antibodies. Annualized incidence rates were calculated and logistic regression models were fitted for assessment of risk factors for recent HIV infection. Among 8,065 susceptible IDUs, 34 had recent infections, for an incidence rate of 1.2% (95% confidence interval: 0.7, 2.0) per person-year. This rate declined from 2.7% in 1987/1988 to approximately 1% per person-year between 1989 and 1998. Two IDU subpopulations were at highest risk for infection: persons under age 30 years (2.8% per person-year) and men who had sex with men (3.0% per person-year). Participants who reported prior HIV test-result counseling were less likely than others to become infected (adjusted odds ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.21, 0.87). Sensitive/less sensitive enzyme immunoassay testing is an effective tool for assessing HIV incidence. HIV incidence among street-recruited IDUs in San Francisco appears to have remained stable and moderate since the late 1980s."
7717,0.005,1.0000,"Although a number of studies have documented that casual household contact does not result in the transmission of HIV, isolated cases of person-to-person transmission have been reported. We report a study of household transmission in which the families were unaware the children were infected with HIV and thus took no precautions to prevent transmission. Twenty-two family members of nine transfusion-associated HIV-infected children were studied for transmission of HIV in households. There was a total of 174 person-year of household exposure; 76 of these exposure years were before the diagnosis of HIV infection in the index child. All family members tested negative for HIV by ELISA. Sharing household facilities, and interactions with the infected child including kissing, bathing, sleeping with, and helping to bathe, dress, and eat, did not result in transmission. Interactions that could theoretically result in person-to-person transmission occurred in these households such as caring for nose bleeds, biting, and home health care procedures. The findings of this and other studies support the participation of HIV-infected infants and children in out-of-home care programs. It remains prudent, however, to observe current recommendations for prevention of HIV-1 for all individuals regardless of whether HIV status is known."
5227,0.005,1.0000,"Spontaneous hepatitis B virus (HBV) e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion is associated with reduced risk of liver-related complications, but is poorly understood. In this study, 113 chronic hepatitis B patients in the immune active HBeAg-positive phase were followed up for 76 weeks. Based on the outcome of liver function, HBeAg, hepatitis B viral e antibody (anti-HBe) and HBV DNA at week 76, 18 patients were classified as spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion group (group A) and 95 patients were classified as non-spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion group (group B). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only week 28 HBV DNA levels were used for the logistic regression equation, and the odds ratio was 0.505 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.366-0.697). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for HBV DNA and HBeAg levels at week 28 were 0.824 (P < 0.001, 95% CI: 0.720-0.927) and 0.832 (P < 0.001, 95% CI: 0.744-0.921), respectively. Based on the maximization of Youden's index, the optimal cutoff values of HBV DNA and HBeAg levels at week 28 were 3.84 log10 IU/ml and 1.53 log10 PEI-U/ml, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of HBV DNA levels at week 28 were 50.0%, 97.9%, 81.8%, and 91.2%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of HBeAg levels at week 28 were 94.4%, 60.0%, 30.9%, and 98.3%, respectively. In conclusion, the dynamic monitoring of HBV DNA and HBeAg levels predicted accurately determines spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion over the duration of 1 year."

We studied the prevalence of the IL28B CC genotype among 53 white HIV controllers, compared with the prevalence among 389 HIV-infected noncontrollers. We found that the IL28B CC genotype was independently associated with spontaneous HIV control (odds ratio [OR], 2.669; P = .017), as were female sex (OR, 7.077; P ≤ .001) and the presence of HLA-B57 and/or B27 (OR, 3.080; P = .017).

Studies report that HIV-1 complicates hepatitis C infection by increasing HCV viral load and reducing spontaneous clearance. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) upstream of the IL28B gene have been associated with spontaneous and treatment-induced clearance of HCV infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the SNP rs12979860 of the IL28B gene and spontaneous clearance of HCV infection in a Brazilian HIV-1 population. The SNP was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction digestion in 138 anti-HCV-positive patients. Spontaneous clearance was observed in 34 subjects (24.6%). Genotype distribution was significantly different between spontaneous clearance and HCV chronic patients. The CT/TT genotypes conferred a nearly 3-fold increased odds to chronic HCV infection relative to the CC genotype (odds ratio, 2.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-6.64; p=0.011).

A total of 2,162 patients admitted to 3 hospitals in Osaka, where the incidence of HCV-related hepatitis is highest in Japan, during the period from 1957 to 1997 were followed up from the date of diagnosis of chronic HCV-related hepatitis until 30 October 1997. Overall, 12,404.5 person-years of observation were accrued with a follow-up period ranging from 0.25 to 40.4 (average 5.74) years. NHL of the B-cell type developed in 4 patients. The interval between onset of chronic HCV and NHL ranged from 6 to 36 (median 13) years. Expected number of cases of NHL in the sex-, age- and calendar year-matched general population was 1.90, which gave a relative risk (RR) of 2.10 (95% confidence interval 0.57-5.38; p = 0.247). Taking the much higher RR for hepatocellular carcinoma among patients with HCV infection into account, chronic HCV infection was considered to be moderately associated with increased risk of NHL."

We examined incidence and survival of KS in HIV-infected patients enrolled in South African ART programs. We analyzed data of three ART programs: Khayelitsha township and Tygerberg Hospital programs in Cape Town and Themba Lethu program in Johannesburg. We included patients aged >16 years. ART was defined as a regimen of at least three drugs. We estimated incidence rates of KS for patients on ART and not on ART. We calculated Cox models adjusted for age, sex and time-updated CD4 cell counts and HIV-1 RNA. A total of 18,254 patients (median age 34.5 years, 64% female, median CD4 cell count at enrolment 105 cells/μL) were included. During 37,488 person-years follow-up 162 patients developed KS. The incidence was 1,682/100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 1,406-2,011) among patients not receiving ART and 138/100,000 person-years (95% CI 102-187) among patients on ART. The adjusted hazard ratio comparing time on ART with time not on ART was 0.19 (95% CI 0.13-0.28). Low CD4 cell counts (time-updated) and male sex were also associated with KS. Estimated survival of KS patients at one year was 72.2% (95% CI 64.9-80.2) and higher in men than in women. The incidence of KS is substantially lower on ART than not on ART. Timely initiation of ART is essential to prevent KS and KS-associated morbidity and mortality in South Africa and other regions in Africa with a high burden of HIV. "

The few antiretrovirals that have been tested against HTLV-1 in vitro have already been developed into anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drugs. Here, we show the effects of a newly synthesized family of phosphonated nucleoside compounds, phosphonated carbocyclic 2'-oxa-3'-aza-nucleosides (PCOANs), on HTLV-1 infection in vitro. To ascertain the anti-HTLV-1 activity of PCOANs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were infected in vitro by coculture with an HTLV-1 donor cell line in the presence of three prototype PCOAN compounds. PCOANs were able to completely inhibit HTLV-1 infection in vitro at a concentration of 1 microM, similar to what has been observed for tenofovir and azidothymidine. Treatment with PCOANs was associated with inhibited growth of HTLV-1-infected cells, and their effects were 100 to 200 times more potent than that of tenofovir. The mechanisms involved in the anti-HTLV-1 effects of PCOANs can mainly be ascribed to their capacity to inhibit HTLV-1 reverse transcriptase activity, as ascertained by means of a cell-free assay. PCOANs caused little reduction in proliferation or induction of apoptotic cell death of uninfected cells, showing toxicity levels similar to tenofovir and lower than azidothymidine. Overall, these results indicate that the family of PCOANs includes potential candidate compounds for long-lasting control of HTLV-1 infection."

The objective of the study is to determine the incidence of renal impairment associated with the use of tenofovir in HIV-infected patients, using abacavir as a control. In a single tertiary care center, all HIV-infected patients with baseline CKD stage 0 or 1 (CKD-1), who were started on either tenofovir or abacavir from 1998 to 2008 and had at least 1 follow-up eGFR measure on therapy, were included in this retrospective analysis. Progression to CKD stages 2 to 5 was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Progression to CKD-2 and CKD-3 occurred more frequently in patients who received tenofovir than those receiving abacavir (CKD-2, 2-year actuarial frequency, 48.8% vs 23.7%; P < .001, log rank; CKD-3, 5.8% vs 0.0%; P = .028). Only 1 patient in the tenofovir group progressed to CKD-4 and none to CKD-5. Treatment with tenofovir was the only independent factor associated with progression to CKD-2 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41-3.18; P < .001) and to CKD-3 (HR, 4.91; 95% CI, 1.02-23.7; P = .048). In HIV-infected patients, long-term therapy with tenofovir is associated with mild-to-moderate nephrotoxicity which is significantly higher than in abacavir-treated patients."
5186,0.005,1.0000,"The primary objective of this study was to measure atazanavir-ritonavir and tenofovir pharmacokinetics when the drugs were used in combination in young adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV-infected subjects > or =18 to <25 years old receiving (> or =28 days) 300/100 mg atazanavir-ritonavir plus 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) plus one or more other nucleoside analogs underwent intensive 24-h pharmacokinetic studies following a light meal. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained at 1, 4, and 24 h postdose for quantification of intracellular tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations. Twenty-two subjects were eligible for analyses. The geometric mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) atazanavir area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC(0-24)), maximum concentration of drug in serum (C(max)), concentration at 24 h postdose (C(24)), and total apparent oral clearance (CL/F) values were 35,971 ng x hr/ml (30,853 to 41,898), 3,504 ng/ml (2,978 to 4,105), 578 ng/ml (474 to 704), and 8.3 liter/hr (7.2 to 9.7), respectively. The geometric mean (95% CI) tenofovir AUC(0-24), C(max), C(24), and CL/F values were 2,762 ng.hr/ml (2,392 to 3,041), 254 ng/ml (221 to 292), 60 ng/ml (52 to 68), and 49.2 liter/hr (43.8 to 55.3), respectively. Body weight was significantly predictive of CL/F for all three drugs. For every 10-kg increase in weight, there was a 10%, 14.8%, and 6.8% increase in the atazanavir, ritonavir, and tenofovir CL/F, respectively (P < or = 0.01). Renal function was predictive of tenofovir CL/F. For every 10 ml/min increase in creatinine clearance, there was a 4.6% increase in tenofovir CL/F (P < 0.0001). The geometric mean (95% CI) TFV-DP concentrations at 1, 4, and 24 h postdose were 96.4 (71.5 to 130), 93.3 (68 to 130), and 92.7 (70 to 123) fmol/million cells. There was an association between renal function, tenofovir AUC, and tenofovir C(max) and intracellular TFV-DP concentrations, although none of these associations reached statistical significance. In these HIV-infected young adults treated with atazanavir-ritonavir plus TDF, the atazanavir AUC was similar to those of older adults treated with the combination. Based on data for healthy volunteers, a higher tenofovir AUC may have been expected, but was not seen in these subjects. This might be due to faster tenofovir CL/F because of higher creatinine clearance in this age group. Additional studies of the exposure-response relationships of this regimen in children, adolescents, and adults would advance our knowledge of its pharmacodynamic properties."
7292,0.005,1.0000,"A high percentage of patients with acute leukaemia in established remission develop chronic liver disease: how important hepatitis-B-virus (HBV) infection is as an aetiological factor is not clear. The presence of HBV markers in liver and serum of 23 leukaemic children with liver disease was investigated at the time of a diagnostic biopsy just before treatment withdrawal. Although, at this time, none had HBV antigens or antibodies in the serum by radioimmunoassay, HBsAg was detected by direct immunofluorescence in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in 13 children, 7 of whom also had hepatitis-B core or e antigens in hepatocyte nuclei. This pattern of both cytoplasmic and nuclear fluorescence was present in 4 of 6 patients with the histological features of chronic active hepatitis on liver biopsy. The failure of release of viral antigens into serum and the absence of an adequate immune response were probably due to the intense chemotherapy used to induce and maintain remission, since HBV markers appeared in the serum within 15 months of stopping treatment in 8 of the children in whom viral antigens had been detected in liver tissue but in none of those whose biopsy specimens were negative by immunofluorescence. These results suggest that HBV infection may be an important cause of chronic liver disease in children with leukaemia and show that during treatment serological tests may fail to detect the presence of the virus."
15906,0.005,1.0000,"Disclosure of HIV status to family, friends, and a stable partner may be linked to improved health outcomes for people living with HIV. This study assessed whether non-disclosure is associated with psychological symptoms, non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and viral load (VL) non-suppression. A total of 3258 HIV-diagnosed individuals in the UK completed the confidential ASTRA study questionnaire (2011-2012). Participants reported whether they told anyone they had HIV; to which confidant(s) (friends, family, work colleagues, stable partner) and to what extent (none, some, most/all). The prevalence and factors associated with non-disclosure were assessed. Associations between non-disclosure and the following factors were established using modified Poisson regression with adjustment for socio-demographic factors (gender, age group, ethnicity), HIV-related factors (time since HIV diagnosis, ART status), and clinic: low social support (score ≤ 12 on modified Duke-UNC FSSQ); depression and anxiety symptoms (≥10 on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 respectively); self-reported ART non-adherence in past 2 weeks/3 months; VL non-suppression (clinic-recorded VL > 50 copies/mL among those who started ART ≥ 6 months ago). Among 3233 participants with disclosure data, the prevalence of non-disclosure to anyone was 16.6 % (n/N = 61/367) among heterosexual men, 15.7 % (98/626) among women, and 5.0 % (113/2240) among MSM. MSM were more likely to disclose to some/all friends compared to family (85.8 vs. 59.9 %) while heterosexuals were less likely to disclose to friends than family (44.1 vs. 61.1 % for men, 57.5 vs. 67.1 % for women). Among 1,631 participants with a stable partner, non-disclosure to a stable partner was 4.9 % for MSM, 10.9 % for heterosexual men, and 13.0 % for women. In adjusted analyses, older age (≥60 years), non-white ethnicity, more recent HIV diagnosis, and not having a stable partner were significantly associated with overall non-disclosure for MSM and heterosexual individuals. The prevalence of low social support was 14.4 %, of depression and anxiety symptoms 27.1 and 22.0 %, respectively, of ART non-adherence 31.8 %, and of viral load non-suppression on ART 9.8 %. There was no evidence that non-disclosure overall (versus disclosure to anyone) was associated with low social support, depression or anxiety symptoms, ART non-adherence or VL non-suppression among MSM or heterosexual individuals. However, compared to MSM who disclosed to 'none' or 'some' friends and family, MSM who disclosed to 'most or all' of their friends and family were more likely to have symptoms of depression (adjusted PR = 1.4, 95 % CI 1.2-1.7), anxiety (1.3, 1.1-1.6), and to report ART non-adherence (1.3, 1.1-1.5). In this large multicentre study of people living with HIV in the UK, non-disclosure was overall low, but higher for heterosexual individuals compared to MSM. Non-disclosure was not associated with higher prevalence of adverse health measures."

Four patients discontinued study drug due to an adverse event and none due to proximal renal tubulopathy. As expected, decreases in CrCl were noted as early as week 2, after which they stabilized. The renal safety profile of STB in patients from this study is consistent with the long-term experience in a large number of patients with CrCl ≥70 mL/min."
16092,0.005,1.0000,"Current agents for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can be classified into interferon-α (standard or pegylated) (IFN) and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs). IFN therapy has the advantage of a finite duration (48 weeks) with a chance for durable sustained off-treatment response in HBeAg positive CHB patients. However, these benefits are limited to approximately 30% of HBeAg positive patients, while parenteral administration and potential side effects are common patient concerns. Thus, patients who can benefit from IFN therapy must be carefully selected and monitored. Recently, stopping rules for IFN non-responders were developed based on 12-week HBsAg levels. NAs are currently used in most CHB patients. They are administered in one tablet daily and can be used in all patients with excellent tolerability and a good safety profile. The current first-line options, entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir (TDF), are highly potent with a minimal risk of resistance during long-term monotherapy. Prolongation of entecavir or tenofovir maintains the initially high virological remission rates in adherent HBeAg positive patients and modifies the long-term outcomes. The need for a long-term, perhaps indefinite, treatment duration is the main limitation of ETV or TDF, which may sometimes be safely discontinued in HBeAg positive patients who achieve stable HBeAg seroconversion. Since there will always be safety concerns and family planning issues with long-term therapy, NAs should be used carefully particularly in young HBeAg positive patients with minimal-mild liver disease."

We compared mortality rates in 327 rural and 317 urban patients with HIV infection in a retrospective cohort study using a multivariate logistic regression model. Rural patients with HIV infection were older at the end of follow-up (43.4 vs. 41.4 years, p = 0.002), and more likely white (93.0% vs. 77.9%, p < 0.001), and a greater proportion were men who have sex with men (55.5% vs. 36.1%, p < 0.001). While the mean year of diagnosis was 1994 in rural patients and 1995 in urban patients (p < 0.001), the mean CD4(+) T cell count at presentation was similar in the two groups: 376 vs. 351 cells/mul (p = 0.298). Rural patients in our cohort were more likely to receive antiretroviral medications at any CD4 count (73.7 vs. 62.1%, p =0.0016), and received PCP prophylaxis at comparable rates (23.5% vs. 25.6%,p =0.555). Mortality was higher in rural patients (10.4% vs. 6.0%, p = 0.028). The risk of mortality remained higher in rural patients when adjusting for age, sex, race, HIV risk factors, year of diagnosis, travel time, lack of insurance, and receipt of antiretroviral treatment or PCP prophylaxis in a logistic regression model (OR 2.11, 1.064 to 4.218, p = 0.047).

No such change was observed for HIV-negative patients. The decrease in mortality is likely due to the more widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)."
179,0.005,1.0000,"Co-infection with GB virus C (GBV-C) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) appears to reduce mortality for HIV/AIDS. Epidemiological and demographic factors for GBV-C were examined prospectively in 167 subjects at risk for co-infection. We attempted to establish a hierarchical exposure risk for GBV-C. Overall exposure to GBV-C was 45.5%. In univariate analysis, GBV-C was associated with male to male sex (P<0.0001), HIV infection (P=0.0005) and hepatitis B infection (P=0.006). Injecting drug use approached statistical significance (P=0.08) while being a female sex worker was not associated with GBV-C exposure/infection (P=0.85). Exposure to GBV-C in 192 healthy blood donors was found to be 9.4%. In conclusion, the data suggest that male to male sex is a more effective mode of transmission of GBV-C and that GBV-C is associated with HIV co-infection. As male to male sex is also a risk factor for HIV transmission our data suggest that many may benefit from the potential protective effect GBV-C exerts on HIV-infected persons."

107,0.005,1.0000,"Due to shared routes of transmission, coinfection with both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is relatively common and results in accelerated liver disease, driving morbidity and mortality. Deaths related to HCV now exceed deaths related to HIV in the United States, and co-infected patients bear a significant proportion of that mortality. This burden may be addressed by novel antiviral therapies that promise increased rates of cure or by enhanced access to liver transplantation, but these are costly interventions. Ultimately, the future burden of coinfection is addressed by greater understanding of who is at risk for development of each infection, thus guiding preventive efforts. Key recent reports regarding the US burden of morbidity and mortality due to HCV and groups at risk for coinfection are reviewed, with a focus on recently described HCV occurring among young injection drug users and men who have sex with men.

10267,0.005,1.0000,"Loss of lean tissue often accompanies human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Exogenous human recombinant GH (hrGH) has been shown to be beneficial in reversing this wasting. However, catabolic effects of hrGH on muscle protein metabolism have also been reported. Therefore, the responsiveness of other GH-sensitive tissues, including bone formation and albumin synthesis, has been examined. Anabolic activity in bone, from serum levels of carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I collagen, was stimulated by 2 weeks of hrGH in controls (56 +/- 15%, P = 0.002), patients with asymptomatic HIV (24 +/- 10%, not significant), patients with AIDS (47 +/- 7%, P < 0.001), and patients with AIDS and > 10% weight loss (21 +/- 12%, P = 0.02). Albumin synthesis, determined from the incorporation of L-[2H5]phenylalanine, was increased in response to hrGH in controls (23 +/- 7%, P < 0.05), HIV+ subjects (39 +/- 16%, P < 0.05), and patients with AIDS (25 +/- 7%, P < 0.01). Patients with AIDS and weight loss, however, did not increase albumin synthesis (-0.6 +/- 12%) in response to hrGH. The results indicate variable anabolic responses to hrGH. Bone collagen synthesis remained sensitive to hrGH, whereas, the anabolic action of hrGH on the synthesis of albumin diminished with severity of disease. However unlike muscle protein synthesis, albumin synthesis was not depressed below basal levels by hrGH."
12449,0.005,1.0000,"To examine if the muscle fibers in patients with inflammatory myopathies have the potential to behave as antigen presenting cells (APCs), we investigated the expression of costimulatory molecules BB-1, B7-1 (CD80), and B7-2 (CD86), and their counterreceptors, CD28 or CTLA-4 (CD152), in the muscle biopsies of patients with polymyositis (PM), PM associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-PM), sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM), dermatomyositis (DM), and normal or disease controls. The expression of the B7 family of molecules on the muscle fibers was limited to BB-1. In PM, HIV-PM, and s-IBM, but not the disease controls, the nonnecrotic, MHC-class I-expressing muscle fibers, invaded or not by CD8+ T cells, had prominent membrane expression of BB-1. Several of the BB-1-positive fibers bound strongly in a cell-to-cell contact with their CD28 or CTLA-4 ligands on the autoinvasive CD8+ T cells, as confirmed by confocal microscopy. By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, the expression of CD28 and CTLA-4 was up-regulated in PM, HIV-PM, and s-IBM, but not the controls. Because the BB-1-positive fibers expressed MHC-class I antigen and bound to up-regulated counterreceptors CD28 and CTLA-4 on the autoinvasive CD8+ T cells only in PM, HIV-PM, and s-IBM, the BB-1 molecule in these diseases should have a functional role in antigen presentation and T cell differentiation. These findings complement recent studies and suggest that in PM, HIV-PM, and s-IBM the muscle fibers are not only targets of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells but may also behave as ""professional"" APC."
9375,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to determine if the myopathy that commonly occurs in patients with AIDS is associated with active HIV-1 infection in the muscle tissues. Seven muscle biopsies from patients infected by HIV-1 and six controls were tested for HIV-1 DNA and RNA using polymerase chain reaction in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase in situ polymerase chain reaction. HIV-1 DNA was detected in rare cells in only one case by standard in situ hybridization. However, after polymerase chain reaction amplification HIV-1 DNA was detected in many cells in four of seven muscle tissues from patients with the viral infection and in none of the controls. The number of cells with detectable provirus in the tissue positive by standard in situ hybridization increased up to 100-fold after amplification. Most of the HIV-1 infected cells were macrophages, as determined by colabeling experiments that were localized mainly in the areas of myocyte necrosis. Myocyte nuclei that contained amplified HIV-1 nucleic acids were also noted. Most virally infected cells contained HIV-1 transcripts, which is consistent with activated infection. The demonstration of many HIV-1 infected macrophages and myocytes in muscle biopsies from HIV-1 infected patients with myopathy suggests that active viral infection may play a role in the clinical disease state."
929,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) regulatory protein Tat is produced in the early phase of infection and is essential for virus replication. Together with other viral products, Tat has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD). As HIV-1 infection in the brain is very limited and macrophage/microglial cells are the only cellular type productively infected by the virus, it has been proposed that many of the viral neurotoxic effects are mediated by microglial products. We and others have shown that Tat affects the functional state of microglial cells, supporting the hypothesis that activated microglia play a role in the neuropathology associated with HIV-1 infection. This review describes the experimental evidence indicating that Tat stimulates microglia to synthesize potentially neurotoxic molecules, including proinflammatory cytokines and free radicals, and interferes with molecular mechanisms controlling cAMP levels, intracellular [Ca2+], and ion channel expression."

The overall prevalence of HBV infection was 54.7%. There were 31 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers (3.9%), with a low rate of HBV e antigen positivity, and none with anti-hepatitis D virus. Subtypes ayw3 and ayw2 of HBsAg were predominant, suggesting that the immigrants carried HBV from their original region to the Amazon. Clustering of HBV infection within families was found. The association between HBV markers and having lived in a gold-miners' camp, even after adjusting for confounders, indicated that the gold-miners may play a role in HBV spread in areas of the Amazon where gold prospecting occurs."

Interestingly, in 2 of these 6 patients (both with Kaposi sarcoma) vIL-6 and LNA-1 were detected in mononuclear lymphoid cells but not in stromal cells of the bone marrow. The detection of vIL-6--positive lymphoid cells in bone marrow suggests a homing for HHV-8--infected elements in this tissue.

Characteristic skeletal infections, such as tuberculosis and bacillary angiomatosis, require a high index of suspicion for accurate diagnosis. Neoplastic processes, such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma, occur more frequently as the immune system deteriorates. Inflammatory and reactive arthropathies are more prevalent in HIV-positive than HIV-negative individuals and include Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, HIV-associated arthritis, painful articular syndrome, acute symmetric polyarthritis, and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.

The present work provides evidence that the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (C-PKA) is packaged within HIV-1 virions as demonstrated using purified subtilisin-digested viral particles. Virus-associated C-PKA was shown to be enzymatically active and able to phosphorylate synthetic substrate in vitro. Suppression of virion-associated C-PKA activity by specific synthetic inhibitor had no apparent effect on viral precursor maturation and virus assembly. However, virus-associated C-PKA activity was demonstrated to regulate HIV-1 infectivity as assessed by single round infection assays performed by using viruses produced from cells expressing an inactive form of C-PKA. In addition, virus-associated C-PKA was found to co-precipitate with and to phosphorylate the CAp24gag protein. Altogether our results indicate that virus-associated C-PKA regulates HIV-1 infectivity, possibly by catalyzing phosphorylation of the viral CAp24gag protein."

Infected myeloid precursor cells of the bone marrow are thought to be a viral reservoir that may repopulate the peripheral blood, central nervous system (CNS), and other organ systems throughout the course of disease. To model select aspects of HIV-1 infection of the bone marrow compartment in vitro, the erythro-myeloid precursor cell line, TF-1, was used. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was found to induce the TF-1 cell line to differentiate through the myeloid lineage and become activated, as demonstrated by cellular morphologic changes and surface expression of differentiation and activation markers. Herein we demonstrate that HIV-1 long terminal repeats (LTRs) from T-, M-, and dual-tropic molecular clones have similar basal LTR activity in TF-1 cells and that differentiation of these cells by PMA resulted in increased LTR activity. Examination of specific cis-acting elements involved in basal and PMA-induced LTR activity demonstrated that the transcription factor families nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and specificity protein (Sp) contributed to the LTR activity of TF-1 cells, the Sp family being the most critical. These studies elucidate the impact of infected bone marrow monocytic cell differentiation on LTR activity and its potential impact on HIV-1-associated disease."

Such a combined modality may not only produce enhanced antiviral effects but also may have a valuable immunorestorative action. The interaction of several ratios of AZT and isoprinosine on the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was determined by reverse transcriptase assay of disrupted virus obtained from supernatants of cells that were exposed to virus and the drugs separately and in combination and by a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 p24 enzyme immunoassay of the same supernatants. The correlation between the reverse transcriptase and enzyme immunoassay data was high. The antiviral activity of AZT alone was neither diminished nor augmented when AZT was used in combination with isoprinosine. Isoprinosine did not enhance virus yield when used alone or in combination with AZT in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, nor did it affect the growth of uninfected cells. The in vitro results indicate that this combination did not decrease the efficacy of AZT or exacerbate virus replication."

One hundred seventy human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients, who had received AZT, ddI, and/or ddC for at least 6 months but were naive for d4T, 3TC, and protease inhibitors, were randomized to AZT at 250 to 300 mg twice daily, 3TC at 150 mg twice daily, and indinavir at 800 mg every 8 h or to d4T at 40 mg twice daily, 3TC at 150 mg twice daily, and indinavir at 800 mg every 8 h. The primary endpoint was time to virological failure, defined as plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of >5,000 copies/ml after at least 8 weeks of antiretroviral therapy. Additional endpoints were change from baseline in CD4 cell counts, AIDS-defining events and adverse events, and proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA levels of <500 copies/ml and HIV-1 RNA levels of <50 copies/ml. At week 80, 15 patients in the AZT arm and 14 patients in the d4T arm had reached the primary endpoint, and time to virological failure did not differ between the two arms (P = 0.98). In the d4T and in the AZT arms, 67 and 73% of patients, respectively, had HIV-1 RNA levels of <500 copies/ml (P = 0.50). The median change from baseline in CD4 cell count was 195 x 10(6) and 175 x 10(6)/liter for the d4T- and AZT-containing arms, respectively. The proportions of patients with HIV-1 RNA levels of <50 copies/ml at weeks 8, 16, and 24 were similar in the two arms. The occurrence of serious adverse events was not significantly different between arms. In conclusion, in these patients heavily pretreated with AZT, switching from AZT to d4T when initiating indinavir and 3TC did not bring any additional benefit compared to maintaining AZT."
2906,0.005,1.0000,"Effective therapy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is mainly based on inhibition of reverse transcriptase by nucleoside analogues such as zidovudine (azidothymidine; AZT), didanosine, and zalcitabine. A major problem associated with long-term AZT therapy is the waning efficacy ('clinical resistance') over time. Clinical isolates of HIV-1 with reduced susceptibility to AZT can be recovered from HIV-infected individuals under prolonged treatment. However, the clinical importance of AZT resistance is uncertain. Other factors such as increased virus burden, increased virulence, and AZT toxicity could contribute, singly or in combination, to the loss of therapeutic benefit. Recent observations based on experimental models and clinical trials suggest that cellular mechanisms ('cellular resistance') may account for clinical resistance to antiviral agents. In vitro experiments demonstrated that in analogy to antitumoral therapy, the acquisition of multidrug resistance, i.e., resistance of cells to multiple, structurally unrelated chemotherapeutic agents, may play a role in the failure of long-term antiretroviral therapy. The 'cellular resistance' may contribute directly to the failure of antiviral therapy by the generation of subtherapeutic levels of antiviral compounds and/or their active forms. Indirectly, such subtherapeutic concentrations of active substances which permit limited replication of virus may represent a selective pressure for emergence and development of a resistant virus population. Hence it is of great importance to investigate the role of cellular factors in 'clinical resistance' to AZT and other anti-HIV agents. More detailed knowledge of cellular interactions and antiviral agents could help to improve or develop new strategies for antiviral therapy regimens."
16014,0.005,1.0000,"The Italian Seroconversion Study (ISS) involves 16 major HIV-treatment centers across Italy and about 1,200 individuals. These individuals were HIV-negative less than 2 years before the first positive test and seroconverted between 1980 and 1994. The majority were infected through i.v. drug use (56%), male-to-male sex (25%), and heterosexual contact (7%). For each end point, crude and adjusted relative hazards were calculated using standard survival techniques such as Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Autoregression models were used to describe CD4 cell reductions. Objectives were as follows: to estimate HIV disease progression rates; to assess whether there are differences in the rate of development of severe immunosuppression, AIDS, and death according to age, gender, and exposure category; to identify co-factors and predictors of disease progression; and to evaluate the clinic-based population ""effect"" of antiretroviral treatment. The risk for developing AIDS among individuals in the ISS cohort was less than 50% by 10 years after HIV seroconversion. Using univariate analysis, more rapid progression was found for older individuals than for younger individuals and for homosexual men compared with those in other exposure categories. No difference between men and women was observed. After adjusting for age, differences among exposure groups disappeared. Individuals with a history of acute HIV disease were more likely to develop AIDS than other seroconverters. Co-infection with HCV and HTLV-II did not accelerate progression to AIDS. The cumulative incidence of receiving pre-AIDS therapy within 7 years of seroconversion was 49.2% (95% CI 45.3-53.0). The relative hazards of developing AIDS in patients who started treatment with zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy was 0.57 (0.36-0.91) and 0.92 (0.64-1.33) within the first year and after 1 year from AZT initiation, respectively. The effect was greater among homosexual men than among i.v. drug users. In conclusion, incident cohort studies may provide accurate information on incubation time and co-factors for disease progression. Observational studies may also provide useful information about the effect of treatment at the community level, which may complement the results of clinical trials."
1763,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated samples of peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) cells from 46 AIDS patients, before starting therapy with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTI), and after 6 months of drug use. PBMC were stored and tested by a Line Probe Assay (LiPA), in order to assess the frequency of RT mutations in this population. Six patients were taking AZT before initial blood collection (1 to 16 weeks of drug use) and 40 patients had no prior therapy. After baseline evaluation, 19 patients received AZT, 23 AZT plus DDI, 3 started AZT only with DDI added after 3 months, and 3 received a combination of AZT plus 3TC. Detection of at least one mutation was found in 33% (15/46) of patients at baseline, and 83% (38/46) had at least 1 mutation after 6 months of therapy. In the majority of cases, samples presented with the wild type and variants of HIV, simultaneously. Patients receiving monotherapy had a higher frequency of mutations (L41 and F214, Y215) than did patients receiving double-drug therapy (19 vs. 10). No specific mutation associated with DDI was identified in 26 patients so treated. Despite the finding of a mean increase in CD4 count and a mild decrease in viral load, patients tended to have an inverse correlation between the CD4 variation and number of mutations detected after 6 months, suggesting potential loss of drug efficacy in the presence of these genotypic changes."
4703,0.005,1.0000,"The acyclic purine nucleoside phosphonates, a newly described class of broad-spectrum antiviral agents, effectively inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in vitro and in animal AIDS models. 9-(2-Phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) is currently being evaluated in clinical trials in patients with AIDS. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of PMEA and a related analog, 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)diaminopurine (PMPDAP), against HIV-1 isolates exhibiting various degrees of resistance to zidovudine (azidothymidine [AZT]). HIV isolates highly (approximately 50 to 200-fold) resistant to AZT were found to be about two- to eightfold less susceptible to PMEA. A comparable degree of cross-resistance to PMPDAP, a structurally related analog of PMEA, was also observed. However, the 50% effective dose values of PMEA or PMPDAP against a panel of HIV isolates showing intermediate levels (approximately 8 to 25-fold) of AZT resistance was indistinguishable from the 50% effective dose values of PMEA (0.7 to 1.7 versus 2 microM) or PMPDAP (0.4 to 1.4 versus 0.8 to 1 microM) against HIV isolates from patients who had not previously used AZT. In addition, we were unable to generate PMEA- (or PMPDAP)-resistant HIV-1 variants by > 30 serial passages of the virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of PMEA. Careful analysis of HIV-1 isolates from patients previously treated with AZT for cross-resistance to PMEA are needed to evaluate the significance of these observations."

During a 10-mo period 111 HIV-1 infected patients with PDUE were examined, of whom 47 (42%) fulfilled the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical case definition for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and seven (6%) had an AIDS-defining illness. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis was diagnosed in 42 (38%) patients, tuberculosis in 25 (23%), cryptococcosis in 14 (13%), Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in 10 (9%), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in five (5%). The diagnosis remained undetermined in 18 (16%) patients. Chest radiograph patterns were generally nonspecific. TBB and BAL had diagnostic yields of 82 and 26% of all final diagnoses, respectively. Our study on Rwandese HIV-1-infected patients with PDUE provides evidence for a large spectrum of pulmonary diseases with relative frequencies differing strikingly from those in developed countries. Detailed investigations confirm the rarity of PCP in Africa and highlight nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis as the predominant diagnosis of PDUE. Empiric antituberculosis treatment is justified in the absence of clinical manifestations suggestive of a specific diagnosis and while awaiting the results of the diagnostic procedures. Primary prophylaxis for PCP would not be appropriate in Africa."
3215,0.005,1.0000,"Understanding early immunological events during HIV-1 infection that may set the course of disease progression is important for identifying correlates of viral control. This study explores the association of differentiation profiles of HIV-specific and total memory CD8(+) T cells with viral set point. A cohort of 47 HIV-1-infected individuals, with differing viral set points at 12 mo, were recruited during acute infection. We identified that the magnitude of IFN-gamma(+) T cell responses at 6 mo postinfection did not associate with viral set point at 12 mo. A subset of 16 individuals was further studied to characterize CD8(+) T cells for expression patterns of markers for memory differentiation, survival (CD127), senescence (CD57), and negative regulation (programmed death-1). We show that viral control and the predicted tempo of HIV disease progression in the first year of infection was associated with a synchronous differentiation of HIV-specific and total CD8(+) memory subpopulations. At 6-9 mo postinfection, those with low viral set points had a significantly higher proportion of early differentiated HIV-specific and total memory CD8(+) cells of a central memory (CD45RO(+)CD27(+)CCR7(+)) and intermediate memory (CD45RO(-)CD27(+)CCR7(-)) phenotype. Those with high viral set points possessed significantly larger frequencies of effector memory (CD45RO(+)CD27(-)CCR7(-)) cells. The proportions of memory subsets significantly correlated with CD38(+)CD8(+) T cells. Thus, it is likely that a high Ag burden resulting in generalized immune activation may drive differentiation of HIV-specific and total memory CD8(+) T cells."
8132,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the management and prognosis of severe Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patients. An observational cohort study of HIV-negative adults with PJP documented by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) through Gomori-Grocott staining or immunofluorescence, admitted to one intensive care unit (ICU) for acute respiratory failure, was undertaken. From 1990 to 2010, 70 patients (24 females, 46 males) were included, with a mean age of 58.6 ± 18.3 years. The mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS)-II was 36.9 ± 20.4. Underlying conditions included hematologic malignancies (n = 21), vasculitis (n = 13), and solid tumors (n = 13). Most patients were receiving systemic corticosteroids (n = 63) and cytotoxic drugs (n = 51). Not a single patient received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as PJP prophylaxis. Endotracheal intubation (ETI) was required in 42 patients (60.0 %), including 38 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In-ICU mortality was 52.9 % overall, reaching 80.9 % and 86.8 %, respectively, for patients who required ETI and for patients with ARDS. In the univariate analysis, in-ICU mortality was associated with SAPS-II (p = 0.0131), ARDS (p < 0.0001), shock (p < 0.0001), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) on BAL (p = 0.0031). In the multivariate analysis, only ARDS was associated with in-ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR] 23.4 [4.5-121.9], p < 0.0001). PJP in non-HIV patients remains a serious disease with high in-hospital mortality. Pulmonary co-infection with HSV or CMV may contribute to fatal outcome."

The corresponding 5'-triphosphate analogs (9) were also synthesized in order to examine inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity. Beyond expectation, some N3-derivatives of AZT were found to reserve the anti-HIV-1 activity to some extent. Among the compounds (2a-i) obtained, 3-allyl-AZT (2e) was the most active against HIV-1 replication in MT-4 cells in vitro with an EC50 value of 0.9 microM. 3-Allyl-AZT 5'-triphosphate (9e), however, exhibited no inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity."

The median observation period was 20.5 months. At 25 months the probability of survival was 82%, the probability of progression of disease from CDC III or IV C2 to IV C1 (AIDS) was 20% in patients on continuous AZT treatment and 50% in patients with interruption of treatment. Three patients developed severe leukopenia and 3 patients severe anemia during AZT treatment. In 1 patient a dose-dependent striking increase of transaminases during AZT treatment was observed. In 7 patients treatment was interrupted, in 1 patient because of anemia, in 1 because of pruritus and in 5 patients because of non-compliance. No significant changes in the consumption of clotting factor concentrates and number of bleeding episodes before and during AZT treatment were noted. We conclude, that both hematological and non-hematological side effects of AZT in HIV 1-infected hemophilic patients are comparable to those seen in other risk groups. AZT does not increase the bleeding tendency in this patient group."
8632,0.005,1.0000,"In a set of 42 antiretroviral naive HIV-1 infected persons who were treated with either Zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy, or a combination of AZT + ddC (Zalcitabine) or AZT + ddI (Didanosine), the HIV-1 DNA load was measured by competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and related to the HIV-1 RNA load in plasma, the CD4+ counts and to clinical markers. The question was whether a reduction in the cellular HIV-1 DNA level contributes to clinical benefit, as predicted by a lasting response in HIV-1 RNA levels in plasma. No significant decline relative to baseline in HIV-1 DNA load was found in the AZT monotherapy arm. In this arm the differences from baseline for both HIV-1 RNA load and CD4+ T cell counts were small and transient. In both combination therapy arms, the maximum mean decline in HIV-1 DNA load was 0.6 log and it never differed significantly from baseline. This is in contrast to plasma HIV-1 RNA load that declined earlier and steeper (mean of 1.5 and 1.9 log for AZT + ddC and AZT + ddI, respectively) and that remained significantly below baseline for 80 weeks. Although 9 of 42 (32%) of the patients under combination therapy had prolonged decreased plasma RNA levels, the proviral HIV-1 DNA remained present in the cells throughout the total follow-up of 144 weeks. In conclusion, combination therapy showed better laboratory parameter responses than AZT monotherapy, in agreement with the clinical data. The HIV-1 DNA sequences did not disappear in any of the patients, heralding renewed active infection after cessation of therapy."
19319,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants resistant to protease inhibitors often display a reduced replicative capacity as a result of an impairment of protease function. Such fitness-impaired viruses display Gag precursor maturation defects. Here, we report that some protease inhibitor-resistant viruses also display abnormalities in the processing of reverse transcriptase (RT) by the protease. In three recombinant viruses carrying resistant protease sequences from patient plasma, we observed a marked decrease in the amount of mature RT subunits and of particle-associated RT activity compared to their parental pretherapy counterparts. We investigated the possibility that a decrease in the amount of particle-associated mature RT could affect the sensitivity of the corresponding virus to RT inhibitors. We observed a twofold increase of sensitivity to zidovudine (AZT) when a virus which carried AZT mutations was processed by a resistant protease. Interestingly, the presence of AZT-resistance mutations partially rescued the replication defect associated with the mutated protease. The interplay between resistance to protease inhibitors and to RT inhibitors described here may be relevant to the therapeutic control of HIV-1 infection."
4039,0.005,1.0000,"This phase I, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study was conducted to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects concomitantly receiving a stable regimen of zidovudine (AZT). Sixteen HIV-infected males with CD4-cell counts ranging from 100 to 550 and not experiencing significant AZT intolerance were enrolled. Subjects received levofloxacin (350 mg of levofloxacin hemihydrate) or a placebo (eight subjects per treatment group) as a single oral dose on day 1, multiple doses every 8 h from days 3 to 9, and a single dose on day 10. On days 1 and 10, an AZT dose (100 mg) was administered concurrently with the study drug. In between these doses, AZT was administered according to the regimen used by the subject prior to entering the study up to a maximum of 500 mg/day. Plasma levofloxacin concentrations were monitored for 36 h after levofloxacin dosing on day 1, immediately prior to the morning doses on days 3 to 9, and for 72 h after dosing on day 10. Plasma AZT concentrations were monitored on day 0 for baseline (for 6 h after the AZT dose) and for 4 h after the AZT doses on days 1 and 10. Levofloxacin was rapidly absorbed (time to maximum plasma concentration, approximately 1.0 h) and extensively distributed in the body with an apparent volume of distribution of approximately 104 liters (approximately 1.34 liters/kg). Steady-state conditions on day 10 were confirmed. Pharmacokinetic profiles of levofloxacin from single doses and multiple (three-times-daily) doses were similar, with a moderate accumulation (observed day 10-to-day 1 ratio of the maximum plasma concentration, approximately 185% versus expected 169%; for the corresponding ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 h [AUC(0-8)], the values were observed 217% versus expected 169%) at steady state. Mean average steady-state peak plasma concentration, plasma levofloxacin concentration at the end of the dosing interval, AUC(0-8), terminal half-life, and total body clearance were 7.06 microg/ml, 3.62 microg/ml, 37.4 microg x h/ml, 7.2 h, and 9.4 liters/h (0.12 liters/h/kg), respectively. Pharmacokinetic profiles of levofloxacin in HIV-infected patients did not appear to be affected by the concomitant administration of AZT; nor were AZT pharmacokinetics altered by levofloxacin. Oral administration of 350 mg of levofloxacin hemihydrate every 8 h appeared to be well tolerated by the subjects. There were no apparent differences in adverse events between the two treatment groups. There were no clinically significant changes from baseline in any laboratory parameter or vital sign following treatments observed in this study. The study results suggest that there is no need for levofloxacin dosage adjustment in HIV-seropositive subjects who concomitantly receive AZT."
12213,0.005,1.0000,"Replication of drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the presence of drug can lead to the failure of antiretroviral drug treatment. Drug failure is associated with the accumulation of drug resistance mutations. Previous studies have shown that 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), (-)2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC), and AZT-resistant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) can increase the virus in vivo mutation rate. In this study, the combined effects of drug-resistant RT and antiretroviral drugs on the HIV-1 mutant frequency were determined. In most cases, a multiplicative effect was observed with AZT-resistant or AZT/3TC dually resistant RT and several drugs (i.e., AZT, 3TC, hydroxyurea, and thymidine) and led to increases in the odds of recovering virus mutants to over 20 times that of the HIV-1 mutant frequency in the absence of drug or drug-resistance mutations. This observation indicates that HIV-1 can mutate at a significantly higher rate when drug-resistant virus replicates in the presence of drug. These increased mutant frequencies could have important implications for HIV-1 population dynamics and drug therapy regimens."

The most common regimens in use at the time of genotype testing were AZT/3TC/nelfinavir, 3TC/D4T/nelfinavir and AZT/3TC/efavirenz. The majority of ARM occurred at protease (PR) gene at residue L90 (41%) and V82 (25%); at reverse transcriptase (RT) gene, mutations at residue M184 (V/I) were observed in 64%. One or more thymidine analogue mutations were detected in 73%. The number of ARM at PR gene increased from a mean of four mutations per patient who showed virological failure at the first ARV regimens to six mutations per patient exposed to six or more regimens; similar trend in RT was also observed. No differences in ARM at principal codon to the three drug classes for HIV-1 clades B or F were observed, but some polymorphisms in secondary codons showed significant differences. Strategies to improve the cost effectiveness of drug therapy and to optimize the sequencing and the rescue therapy are the major health priorities."

We used multivariable generalized estimating equations to estimate the effect of residential eviction on detectable VL and examine ART adherence as a mediating variable. Between June 2007 and May 2014, 705 ART-exposed participants were included in the study, among whom 500 (70.9 %) experienced at least one period of detectable VL. In a time-updated multivariable model, eviction independently increased the odds of detectable VL among those who were homeless [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.25; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.18-4.29] as well as not homeless (AOR = 1.76; 95 % CI 1.17-2.63) post eviction. The results of mediation analyses suggest that this association was mediated by incomplete ART adherence. These findings suggest the need for further development and evaluation of interventions to prevent evictions and promote ART adherence among PWUD facing eviction."
15241,0.005,1.0000,"The relation between a number of potential risk factors and change in body mass index per semester was examined in a community-based cohort of 1,809 homosexual and bisexual men seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The men were followed semiannually for up to 6.5 years between 1984 and 1990. A total of 9,735 person-semesters of observations were available for analysis. A Markov-type autoregressive model, adjusting for previous body mass index, was used to predict the change in body mass index over each person-semester. Overall, the cohort was gaining weight. An asymptomatic participant 1.8 m in height whose CD4+ cell count was > 750/microliters gained a mean of 0.5 kg each person-semester. In bivariate autoregressive models, diarrhea, fever, oral thrush, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and CD4+ lymphocyte counts of < 100 and 100-199 cells/microliters were all associated with a significant decrease in body mass index. A significant inverse association was also found between change in body mass index and lymphadenopathy and herpes zoster, but when the intercept coefficient was added, no overall decrease in body mass index was seen in these models. In a final multivariate model, diarrhea was less strongly associated with a change in body mass index (p = 0.057), although AIDS (p = 0.009), fever (p = 0.006), thrush (p = 0.002), and a CD4+ lymphocyte count of < 100 cells/microliters (p < 0.001) all remained independently associated with a decrease in body mass index. Lymphadenopathy and a CD4+ lymphocyte count of 100-199 cells/microliters were also significant covariates in the final model, but neither of the beta coefficients exceeded that of the intercept, indicating that they were not independently associated with a decrease in body mass index. These findings suggest that the importance of diarrhea as a cause of HIV-related weight loss may have been over-estimated in previous clinic-based studies. AIDS and nonspecific markers of progression (fever, thrush, and a CD4+ count of < 100 cells/microliters) were the best predictors of weight loss during a semester."

Altered body composition, recurrent opportunistic infection and a decline in immune function are associated with the progression of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to AIDS. The factors that might affect nutritional status in AIDS are numerous and include a reduced food intake, increased metabolism, malabsorption and the acute phase response to infection. It is not clear what difference nutritional intervention can make to the progression of the disease. However, there is a consensus that it has an important role to play during the course of the disease. A report was compiled to assess the requirement for a dietitian in an HIV Clinic (the Southern Alberta Clinic) and the role of the dietitian in that position. Nutritional and anthropometric data were collected from medical records. In addition, Clinic physicians were sent a questionnaire. It was found that clients, when seen by the dietitian, had lost weight and had more gastrointestinal symptoms and a lower CD4+ lymphocyte count than the average Clinic patient at their initial Clinic visit. The report recommended that all Clinic staff use body mass index as a screening tool for referral to the dietitian and that good nutrition be promoted by the Clinic as an important part of the care of the HIV infected person. The assessment recommended a 0.4 full-time equivalent position within the Southern Alberta Clinic."

Epidemiologic studies have found that persons infected with HIV are likely to be at higher risk for premature CVD compared with the general population, and clinical studies examining endothelial function in HIV-infected cohorts have supported such conclusions. The mechanisms underlying the regulation of endothelial function in HIV-infected persons appear to be multifactorial, including direct effects of HIV on the endothelium, indirect effects of HIV on lipids and inflammatory cytokines, HAART-related effects, and traditional/host factors. Better understanding of these processes can lead to improved strategies for the long-term management of HIV infection."

Eligibility covered methadone-maintained patients coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C who had received or were currently receiving NFV. The yield was 51 case patients. Parameters examined looked into safety, efficacy, and tolerability. Nelfinavir was discontinued in 2 patients for liver function abnormalities but resumed in 1 patient. One patient developed laboratory abnormalities during NFV therapy that were not present before NFV therapy; in 12 case patients, pre-NFV therapy liver function abnormalities resolved completely during NFV therapy. There was a statistically significant increase in CD4 count during NFV therapy. Viral load decreased or was unchanged in 10 case patients and increased in 8, of whom 5 had a CD4 count increase during NFV therapy. Three patients had diarrhea and 4 patients had constipation. Nelfinavir was not discontinued -- neither was dose adjusted -- in any of these patients. Patients who had received NFV > or =36 months had a smaller increase in mean methadone dose as compared with patients who had received NFV <36 months.

HAART induced a significant decrease in HIV-specific tetramer(+) T cells, whereas EBV-specific tetramer(+) T cells did not change. In addition, individuals who temporarily failed on therapy showed a temporary increase in the number of HIV-specific T cells, suggesting that differences in the pool size of antigen-specific T cells was determined by the presence of antigen. Interestingly, there was an increase in the ratio of IFN-gamma-producing T cells per total number of both HIV- and EBV-specific T cells in the majority of individuals, suggesting that the function of virus-specific T cells is improved in individuals successfully treated with HAART. Despite this relative functional improvement of EBV-specific T cells, no significant changes were observed in EBV load. In four subjects who temporarily failed on HAART, the percentage of IFN-gamma-producing T cells, both for HIV and EBV, paralleled CD4(+) T cell kinetics, suggesting that function seems to be related to differences in CD4(+) T cell numbers. Overall, these data indicate that HAART improves the antigen responsiveness of both HIV- and EBV-specific T cells, which is associated with an increase in CD4(+) T cells."

As these patients survive longer with profound immunodeficiency, they have an increased cumulative risk of developing NHL. This may result in even more AIDS-related NHL in the future than predicted from current epidemiological studies. An increased understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS-related NHL may lead to means of preventing their occurrence. Also, therapies that may prevent immunodeficiency from developing in HIV-infected patients may reduce the likelihood of NHL developing. Current efforts at treating these lymphomas are aimed at preventing the myelosuppression and immunosuppression associated with current regimens, lymphoma relapses within the central nervous system, and the opportunistic infections associated with treatment of these tumors. Ultimately, the best means of preventing the development of these lymphomas is by preventing infection with HIV."
18010,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated the effect of salvage antiretroviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) on the immune system of heavily antiretroviral pretreated HIV-infected children. We carried out a longitudinal study in 20 antiretroviral experienced HIV-infected children to determine the changes in several immunological parameters (T cell subsets, thymic function) every 3 months during 18 months of follow-up on salvage therapy with LPV/r. Statistical analyses were performed with the Wilcoxon test, taking as a reference the basal value at the entry in the study. HIV-infected children showed an increase of CD4+ T cells, a decrease in CD8+ T cells, and an increase in T cell rearrangement excision circle (TRECs) levels. The percentage of HIV children with undetectable viral load (VL < or = 400 copies/ml) increased significantly (p = 0.007) and the percentage with SI viral phenotype decreased significantly (p = 0.002) at the end of the study. Thus, the viral phenotype changed to NSI/R5 after salvage therapy with LPV/r. Interestingly, we observed a significant decrease of memory (CD4+ CD45RO+) and a moderate decrease of activated (CD4+ HLA-DR+, CD4+ HLA-DR+CD38, CD4+, CD45RO+HLA-DR+) CD4+ T cells during the follow-up. On the other hand, memory (CD8+ CD45RO+ and CD8+ CD45RO+CD38+), activated (CD8+ HLA-DR+CD38+, CD8+ HLA-DR+, CD8+ CD38+), and effector (CD8+ CD57+, CD8+ CD28(-)CD57+) CD8+ T cells had a very significant decrease during follow-up. Our data indicate an immune system reconstitution in heavily pretreated HIV-infected children in response to salvage therapy with LPV/r as a consequence of a decrease in immune system activation and an increase in thymic function."

Adherence to ART among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is influenced by several factors related to the patient, the medication, and health facilities. In Togo, previous studies on adherence to ART have reported good adherence to ART during the first year of follow-up. However these may hide many disparities dues to cultural specificities which may differ across geographic areas of the country. We sought to determine the level of adherence to ART and document the associated factors among PLWHA at the regional hospital of Sokodé, Togo."

Here, we show that the neural damage in HIVE mice extends beyond the basal ganglia and is associated with cognitive impairment. Morris water maze tests showed impaired spatial learning 8 d after MDM injection. Moreover, impaired synaptic potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 subregion was demonstrated at 8 and 15 d. By day 15, post-tetanic, short-term, and long-term potentiation were reduced by 14.1, 29.5, and 45.3% in HIVE mice compared with sham-injected or control animals. Neurofilament (NF) and synaptophysin (SP) antigens were decreased significantly in the CA2 hippocampal subregion of HIVE mice with limited neuronal apoptosis. By day 15, the CA2 region of HIVE mice expressed 3.8- and 2.6-fold less NF and SP than shams. These findings support the notion that HIV-1-infected and immune-competent brain macrophages can cause neuronal damage at distant anatomic sites. Importantly, the findings demonstrate the value of the model in exploring the physiological basis and therapeutic potential for HIV-1-associated dementia."
14143,0.005,1.0000,"Although vaccination with Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is considered safe, adverse regional (BCG-itis) and disseminated (BCG-osis) diseases preferentially occur in the immunocompromised host. The infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by mother-to-child transmission leads to impaired cellular immune responses, a situation that poses a great challenge regarding the universal use of BCG vaccine. World Health Organization recommends that children who are known to be HIV-infected, even if asymptomatic, should no longer be immunized with BCG. Many of the complications of BCG vaccination occur in severely immunosuppressed HIV-infected children and are related to late institution of antiretroviral and antimycobacterial therapy. We report two cases of BCG-itis in HIV-infected infants, who fulfilled clinical criteria of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome: axillary adenitis, one with suppuration, and both temporally associated with precocious restoration of immunity elicited by the use of antiretroviral therapy. Isoniazid (10 mg/kg/day) was offered until regression of adenopathies, and lesions were not handled."
15667,0.005,1.0000,"Alterations in hippocampal physiology affect cognition in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-associated dementia (HAD). The mechanism for how this occurs is not well understood. To address this, we investigated how changes in synaptic transmission and plasticity are affected by viral infection and macrophage activation using a severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model of human HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE). HIVE was induced in mice by stereotactic injection of HIV-1-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) into the striatum. Animals were sacrificed after 3, 7 and 15 days. Hippocampal slices were prepared from HIV-1, MDM- and sham-injected animals. Electrically evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Neuronal physiology was assessed by input-output and by long-term potentiation (LTP) assays. We observed that a higher stimulation intensity (mA) was required to induce a 1-mV response in the HIVE mice (0.32+/-0.06) compared with shams (0.17+/-0.01) at day 7. The stimulation intensities at day 15 were 0.44+/-0.07 and 0.23+/-0.05 in the HIVE and shams, respectively. An impairment of synaptic function was detected through measuring synaptic responses induced by stimuli with different intensities. Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) showed deficits in HIVE mice at days 3, 7, and 15. At day 3, PPF ratios were 1.13+/-0.02 and 1.24+/-0.04 in HIVE and sham. The induction and maintenance of LTP was also impaired in HIVE mice. The average magnitude of LTP was 131.23+/-15.26% of basal in HIVE as compared with sham animals of 232.63+/-24.18%. MDM-injected mice showed an intermediate response. Taken together, the results show a range of neuronal synaptic transmission and plasticity changes in HIVE mice that may reflect the mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in human HAD."
9399,0.005,1.0000,"Memantine, a low-to-moderate-affinity NMDA receptor antagonist, can be used to treat cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, its potential neuroprotective effects for human immunodeficiency virus type 1-associated (HIV-1-associated) dementia are less well appreciated. To this end we studied hippocampal synaptic function in a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model of HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE). Human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) infected with HIV-1(ADA) were injected stereotactically into the caudate and putamen of SCID mice, generating HIVE. These brain subregions are among those most affected in humans. Impaired synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) were detected in the CA1 region of hippocampal brain slices of HIVE mice. Memantine-treated HIVE mice showed significant improvements in synaptic function during frequency facilitation tests and LTP induced by high-frequency stimulation when compared with untreated animals. Immunocytochemical measures of neuronal antigens mirrored the neuronal physiological tests. These results demonstrate that memantine attenuates hippocampal synaptic impairment in murine HIVE and provide a rationale for its use in infected humans who experience cognitive decline."
10077,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) persistence may be due to impaired HBV-specific immune responses being unable to eliminate efficiently or cure infected hepatocytes. The immune mechanisms that lead to HBV persistence have not been completely identified, and no appropriate animal model is available for such studies. Therefore, we established a chronic HBV infection model in a mouse strain with human leukocyte antigen A2/DR1 (HLA-A2/DR1) transgenes and an H-2 class I/class II knockout. The liver of these mice was transduced with adeno-associated virus serotype 2/8 (AAV2/8) carrying a replication-competent HBV DNA genome. In all AAV2/8-transduced mice, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus e antigen, and HBV DNA persisted in serum for at least 1 year. Viral replication intermediates and transcripts were detected in the livers of the AAV-injected mice. The hepatitis B core antigen was expressed in 60% of hepatocytes. No significant inflammation was observed in the liver. This was linked to a higher number of regulatory T cells in liver than in controls and a defect in HBV-specific functional T-cell responses. Despite the substantial tolerance resulting from expression of HBV antigens in hepatocytes, we succeeded in priming functional HBV-specific T-cell responses in peripheral tissues, which subsequently reached the liver. This AAV2/8-HBV-transduced HLA-A2/DR1 murine model recapitulates virological and immunological characteristics of chronic HBV infection, and it could be useful for the development of new treatments and immune-based therapies or therapeutic vaccines for chronic HBV infections."
18944,0.005,1.0000,"In the light of increasing prevalence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), anaesthetists are likely to see more patients with this virus in their practice. This study evaluated, using a questionnaire format, the knowledge, attitude and practices of anaesthetists in the management of HIV infected surgical patients. The questionnaire sought demographic information, the knowledge of risks involved as well as attitude and practices. One hundred (66.7%) out of 150 questionnaires distributed amongst members of the Nigerian Society of Anaesthetists were completed and returned. Fifty-five per cent (55%) of the respondents confirmed their willingness to be screened but only 45% had had a personal HIV screening test. Even though 23% of all the respondents will transfuse unscreened blood in an emergency, only 1(8.3%) of the consultants will do so. This trend was also reflected in gloving behaviour as 11(91.6%) of consultants will routinely wear gloves whilst only 12(70.5%) of the senior house officers will routinely glove for venepuncture despite the availability of gloves. Other precautionary facilities such as goggles, sharp disposal bins, routine screening of all surgical patients were more available in private than in government hospitals. Ninety- six per-cent of all respondents will initiate an action after a needle stick injury whilst 4% will ignore. General Anaesthesia was the choice of anaesthetic in an HIV/AIDS infected patient by 43% of respondents whilst 22% of respondents would choose regional technique. However, only 85% of respondents were willing to anaesthetise an infected patient. This study suggested a dearth of knowledge and perception of risks of HIV/AIDs amongst Nigerian Anaesthetists. Appropriate training and greater education is highly recommended. Rigorous infection control policy is imperative and hospital authorities must ensure availability of protective facilities."
19803,0.005,1.0000,"Prior experiments in explants of human lymphoid tissue have demonstrated that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) productively infects diverse cellular targets including T cells and tissue macrophages. We sought to determine the specific contribution of macrophages and T cells to the overall viral burden within lymphoid tissue. To block infection of macrophages selectively while preserving infection of T cells, we used viruses deficient for viral protein R (Vpr) that exhibit profound replication defects in nondividing cells in vitro. We inoculated tonsil histocultures with matched pairs of congenic viruses that differed only by the presence of a wild-type or truncated vpr gene. Although these viruses exhibited no reduction in the infection or depletion of T cells, the ability of the Vpr-deficient R5 virus to infect tissue macrophages was severely impaired compared with matched wild-type R5 virus. Interestingly, the Vpr-deficient R5 virus also exhibited a 50% reduction in overall virus replication compared with its wild-type counterpart despite the fact that macrophages represent a small fraction of the potential targets of HIV-1 infection in these tissues. Collectively, these data highlight the importance of tissue macrophages in local viral burden and further implicate roles for CC chemokine receptor 5, macrophages, and Vpr in the life cycle and pathogenesis of HIV-1."

In 2008, 35% of homosexual participants, 26% of heterosexual participants and 11% of female participants reported methamphetamine use in the past year. Of participants, 29% reported using the Internet to find sex partners; Internet-users versus non-Internet-users reported a higher median number of sex partners in 6 months (4 vs. 1), were more likely to report unprotected sex (32 vs. 10%), and higher rates of methamphetamine use in the past 12 months (48 vs. 24%). Given the association among methamphetamine use, increased sex partners and Internet use, the Internet may present a new and effective medium for interventions to reduce methamphetamine-associated sexual risk behavior."
8608,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals develop a genetically diverse virus population over time, but often only a limited number of viral variants are transmitted from a chronic carrier to a newly infected person. Interestingly, many women but few men are infected by multiple HIV-1 variants from a single partner. To determine whether the complexity of the infecting virus population influences clinical outcome, we examined viral diversity in the HIV-1 envelope sequences present at primary infection in 156 women from Kenya for whom we had follow-up data on viral RNA levels and CD4 T-cell counts. Eighty-nine women had multiple viral genotypes, while 67 women had a single genotype at primary infection. Women who acquired multiple viral genotypes had a significantly higher viral load (median, 4.84 versus 4.64 log(10) copies/ml, P = 0.04) and a significantly lower CD4(+)-T-cell count (median, 416 versus 617 cells/mm(3), P = 0.01) 4 to 24 months after infection compared to women who were infected with a single viral genotype. These studies suggest that early HIV-1 genetic diversity is linked to faster disease progression."

To clarify the spectrum of M. kansasii infection in this population, we conducted a retrospective study of 35 patients. Twenty-eight of these patients were believed to have disease due to M. kansasii, while the remaining seven patients were probably colonized with the organism. All but two patients presented with advanced HIV infection; the median CD4 cell count was 12/microL. Most patients with pulmonary disease presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea, but only eight of these 22 patients had radiographic findings of either pulmonary cavitation or predominantly upper-lobe disease. Ten patients had M. kansasii isolated from blood or bone marrow. The majority of patients with pulmonary or disseminated disease responded to therapy. However, 11 patients died either before mycobacterial infection was diagnosed or early in the course of treatment, and two had a relapse of infection during therapy."

2298,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of different genotypes of Hepatitis C virus may vary between geographic areas and it is possible that various genotypes have different pathogenic characteristics. Therefore, 90 consecutive Italian patients anti-Hepatitis C Virus positive with a broad spectrum of chronic liver disease, have been analysed to observe prevalence of various genotypes of Hepatitis C Virus. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction with a set of nested biotinylated primers, located in 5'UTR region. Genotype 1b and genotype 2a were the most commonly encountered (respectively, 50% and 37%) whereas other genotypes were rare. The unexpected high prevalence of genotype 2a allowed direct comparison of clinical characteristics and response to therapy between patients with genotype 2a and those with 1b. Genotype 1b was more prevalent than 2a in patients over 60 years (29 vs 12) and in those with more severe liver disease (34 vs 16). In a univariate analysis, genotype 2a was associated with less severe liver disease (p = 0.02) and younger age (p = 0.018), in comparison with genotype 1b. Patients with genotype 2a responded to interferon alpha therapy better than those with 1b (p = 0.007). In a multivariate analysis, only younger age was associated with genotype 2a. Genotype 2a (in comparison with 1b) and absence of cirrhosis were independent predictors of response to interferon alpha. In conclusion, genotype 2a is playing an emerging role in younger Italian patients and seems more sensitive than 1b to interferon alpha therapy."
2094,0.005,1.0000,"As therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection evolves, optimizing hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment and identifying factors that impact its response in the HIV/HBV-coinfected population is critical. We identified retrospectively 45 HBV/HIV-coinfected patients with detectable HBV DNA by the Bayer VERSANT HBV 3.0 bDNA assay (limit of quantification 2000 copies/mL) at baseline and/or year 1 of therapy. Patients were divided into three groups based on the active HBV agent in their antiretroviral regimen: group 1 (n = 15) received lamivudine; group 2 (n = 10), lamivudine plus tenofovir and group 3 (n = 20), lamivudine followed by lamivudine plus tenofovir. HBV genotypes and resistance profiles were determined by the Bayer Trugene HBV 1.0 assay. More patients in group 2 achieved HBV DNA suppression below 2000 copies/mL (80%), loss of HBe antigen (HBeAg) (40%) and loss of HBeAg and gain of anti-HBe (20%) than did patients in group 1 or 3. More patients with HBV genotype A, achieved HBV DNA suppression <2000 copies/mL than did patients with non-A genotypes [74% (26/35) vs 20% (2/10)], respectively (P = 0.003). Risk for virological nonresponse was significant in those with non-A genotypes [odds ratio (OR) 11.1; 95% CI: 2.0-50], previous HIV therapy (OR 6.5; 95% CI: 1.2-35) and <90% compliance (OR 3.7; 95% CI: 0.99-14.3). Simultaneous therapy with lamivudine/tenofovir suppresses HBV DNA more effectively than lamivudine or tenofovir added to lamivudine.

Our objective was to determine whether fenofibrate and pravastatin were equivalent for the treatment of combined dyslipidemia in HIV as measured by a composite of the National Cholesterol Education Project (NCEP) goals based on absolute values for low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and to compare the safety of these agents through 48 weeks. This was a randomized, open-label trial with subjects assigned to fenofibrate 200 mg (n = 88) or pravastatin 40 mg (n = 86) daily. Subjects who failed to reach the NCEP composite goal on monotherapy by week 12 received both drugs. The composite goal at week 12 was achieved in 1% of fenofibrate and 5% of pravastatin subjects. At week 16, 69/88 subjects on fenofibrate added pravastatin (FP) and 67/86 subjects on pravastatin added fenofibrate (PF). At week 48, 7% FP subjects and 3% PF subjects achieved the composite goal. Median changes in LDL/HDL/TG/non-HDL were -8/+5/-144/+50 and -14/+2/-66/+34 mg/dl in subjects receiving FP and PF, respectively. There were few adverse events and no rhabdomyolysis reported. Combination therapy with fenofibrate and pravastatin for HIV-related dyslipidemia provides substantial improvements in lipid parameters and appears safe, but is unlikely to achieve all NCEP targets for lipid levels."

Combination therapy with daclatasvir and asunaprevir (DCV/ASV) that has proven efficacy for dialysis patients infected with genotype 1b HCV (HCV/1b) has several concerns in Japan. The recently available combination therapy with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir (OBV/PTV/r) is not contraindicated in patients with chronic renal failure and has more safety profile and shorter treatment period than that with DCV/ASV. We evaluated the effects of combination therapy with OBV/PTV/r in four dialysis patients infected with HCV/1b, who were eligible for our study. On-treatment assessments included standard laboratory testing, serum HCV RNA and symptom-directed physical examinations. Three patients had a sustained virological response at 12 weeks after treatment, but one remaining patient had viral breakthrough. Notably, the patient with viral breakthrough had been coinfected with HCV/1b and HCV/2b; namely, HCV/2b with resistance-associated variations was not eradicated by the combination therapy. Among the three patients responsive to the combination therapy, one patient complained of appetite loss and itching, while in another patient the therapy was discontinued due to itching, exacerbation of wamble, and a falling tendency probably due to interaction with valsartan. These AEs were ameliorated or disappeared after the completion of the therapy. The significance of our study is persuasive virological evaluation associated to the combination therapy and reasonable interpretation of AEs. In conclusion, combination therapy with OBV/PTV/r may have promise as an efficacious therapy, but caution regarding AEs should be practiced."

Approximately 60% of these women are African American, and 18% are Latina. A gynecologic infection is the most common symptom that leads to initial medical evaluation. Specific studies at baseline should include CD4 lymphocyte count, HIV-1 RNA level, and gynecologic examination with Papanicolaou smear. Decisions about initiation of antiretroviral therapy depend on the patient's clinical diagnoses, her willingness to adhere to treatment, and CD4 lymphocyte and HIV-1 RNA levels. Levels of HIV-1 RNA may be somewhat lower in women than in men at the same CD4 count, whereas women have higher CD4 lymphocyte counts at the time of AIDS diagnosis. However, prospective trials have not yet indicated the need to change the threshold CD4 lymphocyte counts or HIV-RNA levels for initiation of therapy in women. The efficacy of antiretroviral therapy appears to be similar in men and women, although women are more likely to experience toxicities. Abnormal Papanicolaou smears occur in approximately 40% of women at baseline, and 58% are infected with human papillomavirus. The prevalence of both conditions increases with lower CD4 lymphocyte counts and higher HIV-1 RNA levels. Precursor lesions to cervical cancer may be effectively treated, but almost 50% recur within 1 year, mandating careful follow-up. Referral should be sought for specialized gynecologic care and for issues related to HIV itself, since survival is prolonged in patients treated by physicians who are experienced in treating HIV. When they are provided the same access to care, HIV-infected women have similar prognoses as HIV-infected men."

Thirty adults with symptomatic HIV infection, no previous AIDS-defining diagnosis, and CD4+ counts of 0.200-0.499 x 10(9)/L (200-499/mm3) received 28 tablets each day of either a standardized oral preparation of 31 Chinese herbs or a cellulose placebo. Primary outcome measures were changes in life satisfaction, perceived health, and number and severity of symptoms. Other outcomes included adherence, and changes in weight, CD4+ count, depression, anxiety, physical and social function, and mental health. Two placebo- and no herb-treated subjects had mild adverse events (AE). Subjects on both arms reported taking 94% of prescribed tablets. No differences between treatment groups reached the p < 0.05 level. Life satisfaction improved in herb-treated [+0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): +0.29, +1.43] but not in placebo-treated subjects (+0.20, 95% CI -0.35, + 0.75). Number of symptoms was reduced in subjects receiving herbs (-2.2, 95% CI -4.1, -0.3) but not in those receiving placebo (-0.3, 95% CI -3.2, +2.7). There were trends toward greater improvements among herb-treated subjects on all symptom subscales except dermatologic. Believing that one was receiving herbs was strongly associated with reporting that the treatment had helped (p < 0.005), but not with changes in life satisfaction or symptoms. There were improvements in life satisfaction and symptoms among subjects receiving the herbal therapy. Whether Chinese herbs are effective in the management of symptomatic HIV infection can be adequately addressed only by larger trials of longer duration."

In this study, 102 children born from HIV-1-infected mothers between 1998 and 2004 in the city of Rio Grande, Brazil were analyzed for potential risk factors associated with MTCT. That geographic region is characterized by a high proportion of subtype C-infected subjects, and it allowed comparison between subtypes B and C and their influence on MTCT. The analysis also included clinical, obstetric and immunological parameters. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the influence of the parameters on MTCT, and prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI95) were also calculated. A surprisingly high prevalence of subtype C of over 70% was found. Only the HIV viral load and the use of ACTG 076 protocol were predictive of MTCT. HIV subtype and CD4 T-cell counts were not associated with increased risk of transmission. Although a clear expansion of subtype C is evident in southern Brazil, it does not seem to correlate with increased risk of vertical transmission."

Of those cases, more than 10% are children under 15 years of age. The vast majority of pediatric HIV infection is due to perinatal transmission. More than 95% of HIV-infected people live in the developing world. Different studies are currently being conducted with modifications of the original PACTG-076, especially shorter courses of zidovudine (ZDV), combinations of antiretrovirals (ZDV and 3TC), or comparison of a modified version of the standard ZDV course vs. a single dose of nevirapine for the mother intrapartum and also for the newborn. The results of these studies may provide more affordable, alternative regimens to prevent maternal-to-child HIV-1 transmission for developing countries than the PACTG-076 protocol. It is very important that physicians and physician extenders (nurse practitioners and physician assistants) caring for infants born to HIV-infected mothers have an understanding of the pathophysiology of vertical HIV-1 infection transmission.

This study, using a paired mother-teenager population, aimed to assess whether maternal HBsAg-negative HBV infection ((hn)HBI) is a significant source of child HBV infection (HBI). A follow-up study with blood collection has been conducted on the 93 mother-teenager pairs from the initial 135 pregnant woman-newborn pairs 13 years after neonatal HBV vaccination. Serological and viral markers of HBV have been tested, and phylogenetic analysis of HBV isolates has been done. The HBI prevalence was 1.9% (1 (hn)HBI/53) for teenage children of non-HBI mothers, compared with 16.7% (1 (hn)HBI/6) for those of (hn)HBI mothers and 2.9% (1 HBsAg-positive HBV infection [(hp)HBI]/34) for those of (hp)HBI mothers. Similar viral sequences have been found in one pair of whom both the mother and teenager have had (hn)HBI. In comparison with the (hp)HBI cases, those with (hn)HBI had a lower level of HBV load and a higher proportion of genotype-C strains, which were accompanied by differentiated mutations (Q129R, K141E, and Y161N) of the ""a"" determinant of the HBV surface gene. Our findings suggest that mother-to-teenager transmission of (hn)HBI can occur among those in the neonatal HBV vaccination program."
14760,0.005,1.0000,"The hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus share the same transmission routes, which makes co-infection an unfavorable condition for the natural history of both viral diseases. In this context, it should be highlighted that the knowledge of the extent of co-infection and associated risk factors is a vital tool for prevention and control over infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to review the literature, seeking to examine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus co-infection reported in studies conducted in Brazil, and identify the main risk factors associated with co-infection. The electronic search was conducted in the Medline, Lilacs and SciELO databases. The following keywords were used: human immunodeficiency virus and Hepatitis C or hepatitis C virus and Brazil. The search led to 376 articles, of which 69 were selected for data extraction. We excluded animal studies, reports or case series, review articles, letters to the editor, other types of hepatitis and those studies in which co-infected patients were intentionally selected for comparison to single infected individuals. As a result, 40 articles were reviewed. The majority of the population in these studies was male (71%) and young adults, with a mean age of 26.7 years. The prevalence of hepatitis C virus co-infection among individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus in the studies conducted in Brazil ranged from 3.3% (serum samples) to 82.4% (drug users), with an average of 20.3%. The findings reveal that the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus co-infection is highly variable, depending on the characteristics of the study population. Risk factors associated with human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus co-infection were injection drug use and blood transfusion. "
759,0.005,1.0000,"The eight genotypes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) exhibit distinct geographical distributions. This study identified HBV genotypes and transmission modes associated with acute infection in British Columbia (BC), Canada, from 2001 to 2005. Seventy cases of acute HBV in BC were identified from laboratory reports using a standardized case definition. Interviews for risk factors and hepatitis history were conducted for each case. HBV genotypes were determined by BLAST comparison analysis of the surface (S) or preS gene sequence. To illustrate the distribution of genotypes identified amongst acute cases in BC, an annotated map was produced showing the global occurrence of HBV genotypes. The majority of acute HBV cases occurred in Caucasian, Canadian-born males, with 30% of cases reporting injection drug use (IDU) and 21% reporting incarceration. The most common genotype observed was genotype D (62.9%), followed by genotypes A (18.6%), C (11.4%), B (4.3%), and E (1.4%). A significant association was observed between Genotype D and IDU (P = 0.0025) and previous incarceration (P = 0.0067). Phylogenetic analysis of the S gene sequence demonstrated identical or high genetic relatedness amongst genotype D viral strains (86% sub-genotype D3), thus verifying transmission clustering amongst BC injection drug users. The association between acute HBV genotype and reported transmission modes has not been previously described in North America. Tracking of genotypes can help identify disease transmission patterns and target at-risk populations for preventive immunization."

To our knowledge, no study addressing knowledge of mechanisms of HIV transmission and condom use has been done on HIV-positive heterosexual men and women."
1417,0.005,1.0000,"Although encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection has been commonly documented among domestic animals, less is known about EMCV transmission among humans. Recently, we described the isolation of EMCV from two febrile patients in Peru. To further investigate EMCV transmission in Peru, we screened febrile patients reporting to health clinics in Peru for serological evidence of recent EMCV infection. We also conducted a serological survey for EMCV-neutralizing antibodies in the city of Iquitos, located in the Amazon basin department of Loreto, Peru. Additionally, we screened serum from rodents collected from 10 departments in Peru for evidence of EMCV exposure. EMCV infection was found to be only rarely associated with acute febrile disease in Peru, accounting for <1% of febrile episodes analyzed. Despite the low acute disease burden associated with the virus, human exposure was quite common, as prevalence of EMCV-neutralizing antibodies ranged between 6.0% in the coastal city of Tumbes and >17% in cities in the tropical rainforest of northeastern Peru (Iquitos and Yurimaguas). On the basis of the serological survey conducted in Iquitos, risk factors for past infection include increased age, socioeconomic indicators such as residence construction materials and neighborhood, and swine ownership. Evidence from the rodent survey indicates that EMCV exposure is common among Murinae subfamily rodents in Peru (9.4% EMCV IgG positive), but less common among Sigmodontinae rodents (1.0% positive). Further studies are necessary to more precisely delineate the mode of EMCV transmission to humans, other potential disease manifestations, and the economic impact of EMCV transmission among swine in Peru."

18861,0.005,1.0000,"This study aimed at analyzing the reasons that patients co-infected with tuberculosis and HIV leave the treatment of tuberculosis and to know the conduct of the health team toward that abandonment. The study, using a qualitative approach, performed semi-structured interviews on 45 professionals working at a referral health center in Pará state. Two units emerged based on the thematic analysis: patient-associated factors that make TB treatment adherence difficult; and service-associated factors that contribute to treatment abandonment. It was found that, in terms of the patients, that their low socioeconomic condition was the most common factor that led to abandonment. Other factors that led to this outcome included the adverse drug effects, the use of illegal drugs, and poor personal motivation. Regarding the service, issues related to the physical structure, working process organization and accessibility were also relevant to their non-adherence. Results show there is a need to change the practices performed at the health care services."
5150,0.005,1.0000,"This qualitative study examined the role of experienced HIV-infected lay individuals who work in HIV medical care settings as educators. Participants in this study had been in the role an average of 4 years, and referred to their work as ""peering,"" a newly coined verb in the vein of nursing. An overarching theme was that the title ""peer educator"" captured neither the scope of their work, nor the skill set they contribute to patient care. Peers brought unique contributions to the HIV care team that were vital to encouraging patients to stay engaged in care. Peers felt undervalued and expressed the wish to be ""professionalized."" Results from this study suggest that peers show promise as behavior change agents who can model healthful behaviors, particularly for newly diagnosed patients or those struggling with engagement in HIV care and adherence to treatment. However, peers need and want more formal training in behavior change science, and peer-led services must become more uniform and readily available to patients across HIV care settings. Research is needed to document the positive impact that peers can have on HIV-related health outcomes and to increased knowledge about the attributes of successful peers."
7092,0.005,1.0000,"Approximately 30% of patients participating in the national antiretroviral therapy (ART) program in Argentina fail to achieve an undetectable viral load, and approximately 25% are not retained in care. This qualitative study was designed to explore and identify factors associated with engagement and retention in public and private health care in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Qualitative data from key informants (n = 12) and focus groups (n = 4 groups) of patients and providers from private and public HIV treatment facilities were recorded and transcribed. Predetermined and arising themes related to adherence, engagement, and retention in care were coded and analyzed using qualitative data analysis software. Reasons identified for patients' lack of adherence or engagement in care differed between patients and providers, and patients attributed limitations to low self-efficacy, fear and concerns about HIV, and lack of provider involvement in treatment. In contrast, providers viewed themselves as decision-makers in patient care and patients as responsible for their own nonadherence due to lack of commitment to their own health or due to medication side effects. Patients reported health care system limitations and HIV concerns contributed to a lack of engagement, and providers identified limited HIV literacy and stigma as additional problems. Both agreed that chronic illness and substance addiction impacted adherence and retention, and agreed on the importance of trust, honesty, and communication in the patient-provider relationship. Results support the incorporation of system-, provider-, and patient-focused components into interventions to facilitate patient engagement, adherence, and retention in public and private settings in Argentina.

1062,0.005,1.0000,"In the 6-year period 1984-1989, 101 liver biopsies or 'needle necropsies' from human immunodeficiency virus positive patients were examined histologically. Of these, only nine showed no abnormality whatsoever. The commonest histological findings were either fatty change or changes related to co-existent chronic viral hepatitis. Granulomas were seen in 15 cases, four of which were positive for acid-fast bacilli. A range of organisms were recorded: cytomegalovirus (4); Histoplasma capsulatum (1); Pneumocystis carinii (2); Cryptococcus neoformans (1); and Leishmania donovani (1). There were two cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but no cases of Kaposi's sarcoma. Marked iron deposition, which correlated with multiple blood transfusions was seen in nine biopsies. We were unable to identify any histological feature in the liver as being specific for HIV infection. The high incidence of liver abnormalities reflects: (i) the coincident exposure to hepatotropic viruses; (ii) the presence of opportunistic infections and neoplasms, usually part of a disseminated multi-organ process arising in the setting of profound immune depression; (iii) iatrogenic causes, in particular iron overload related to multiple blood transfusions received for treatment of zidovudine-induced anaemia; and (iv) non-specific changes associated with chronic debilitating disease."
12758,0.005,1.0000,"The documented prevalence of alcohol use among individuals with HIV is higher than reported among the general public. Little is known about how populations with HIV perceive the risks of alcohol use and what they consider to be safe levels of consumption. This qualitative study was conducted to increase understanding of the situations and environments in which alcohol is consumed and to explore the perceptions of risks among individuals with HIV, who were engaged in medical care and using alcohol regularly. Nineteen qualitative semi-structured individual interviews were conducted. The major themes that arose from these analyses were patterns of alcohol use, perceptions of risk based on the type of alcohol used, and the impact alcohol had on health. Findings suggest that alcohol is used regularly with little perception of risk; alcohol is perceived to have little effect on health and HIV progression; and providers rarely discuss alcohol use with patients. Future research includes assessment of alcohol use and the delivery of brief interventions to improve general health and HIV-related outcomes."
3518,0.005,1.0000,"AIDS, ARC, and other HIV-associated diseases were originally conceptualised exclusively in terms of defects in cell-mediated immunity and its consequences. But it is now becoming clear that HIV disease can also be a primary neuropsychiatric disorder, although the precise mechanism by which the retrovirus causes impairment in brain function and, ultimately, structural brain damage, remains obscure. The work presented here indicates another shift in our thinking concerning HIV infection. Until recently it was believed that neurological and neuropsychiatric phenomena tended to occur in the late stages of HIV disease. While that might be true for the more severe form of symptomatology that has been termed the AIDS dementia complex, we believe there is at least preliminary evidence that cognitive change can occur earlier in the course of illness, perhaps even in some medically asymptomatic HIV+ individuals. Other investigators have also noted increased neuropsychological abnormality in patients before they developed AIDS or ARC. For example, Janssen et al. found that about half their patients with lymphadenopathy syndrome (LAS) had some neuropsychological test deficits. Durara et al. recently reported on cerebral metabolic rates for glucose in seven HIV+ asymptomatic individuals, compared to 10 HIV- controls. Four of the HIV+ individuals had abnormal asymmetry in frontal and temporal regions suggesting focal reduction in cerebral glucose metabolism. Further indirect evidence that virus can enter the central nervous system early in the course of HIV disease comes from the work of McArthur and associates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
14297,0.005,1.0000,"Proliferative defects have been reported at the level of DNA synthesis, even in T-lymphocytes from asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus type-1+ (HIV-1+) patients. Since purine and pyrimidine ribonucleotide availability is crucial for proliferation, we compared the ability of HIV-1- and HIV-1+ T-lymphocytes (> 95% CD4+ and CD8+) to activate de novo biosynthetic and salvage pathways following phytohemagglutinin stimulation using 14C-labeled precursors. The striking abnormality already detectable in asymptomatic patients' cells was the impaired ability of CTP, UDP-Glc, and UTP pools to expand over 72 h (44-70% of control), although ATP and GTP pools and responses were normal. In symptomatic patients, resting T-cells showed markedly reduced pyrimidine pools (53-74% of control) with no change following activation. Relatively normal ATP, GTP, and NAD pools masked the same impaired response of de novo synthesis to activation, with ATP and GTP being reduced by 50% at 48 h. Purine salvage was more active than the control in unstimulated HIV-1+ cells. This impaired de novo synthesis in HIV-1+ T-lymphocytes severely restricts the availability of ribonucleotides for vital growth-related activities such as membrane expansion and strand break repair as well as DNA and RNA synthesis. The data indicate that resting T-lymphocytes from symptomatic patients survive through enhanced salvage, but the stimulation induces metabolic cell death, and provide an explanation for the activation-associated lymphocyte death seen in HIV-1+ T-lymphocytes."
18045,0.005,1.0000,"This longitudinal qualitative study sought to understand how and why a livelihood intervention affected the health and health behaviors of HIV-infected Kenyan adults. The intervention included a microfinance loan, agricultural and financial training, and a human-powered water pump. In-depth interviews were conducted at two time points with intervention and control participants and program staff. We double coded interviews (n = 117) and used thematic content analysis of transcripts following an integrative inductive-deductive approach. Intervention participants described improvements in HIV health, including increased CD4 counts and energy, improved viral suppression, and fewer HIV-related symptoms. Better health was linked to improved clinic attendance and ART adherence through several mechanisms: (1) reductions in food insecurity and abject hunger; (2) improved financial stability; (3) improved productivity which enhanced social support; (4) better control over work situations; and, (5) renewed desire to prioritize their own health. Livelihood interventions may improve health by influencing upstream determinants of health behavior including food security and poverty."

Salivary gland biopsy specimens showed diffuse lymphocytic infiltration of the glandular parenchyma. Serum autoantibodies and rheumatoid factor were not detected. All patients had IgG antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus and IgG to the viral capsid antigen of Epstein-Barr virus. These five patients had benign lymphocytic infiltrates in other organs (lung, liver, and kidneys). Sicca complex may be one of the various manifestations of the lymphoid hyperplasia noted in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. In these patients, the sicca complex showed specific features related to male predominance, lack of serum autoantibodies, and peripheral-blood T-lymphocyte subset distribution."

All patients were taking immunosuppressive treatment at the time of infection. Persistent cough, dyspnea, and severe hypoxemia were the most characteristic clinical signs. All patients presented with lymphopenia (average CD4-cell count=275/mm3), two with hypoalbuminemia, and one with renal failure. In all cases, the microscopic analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage was used to establish the diagnosis.

9806,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether hepatitis C virus plays any role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients. The role of age, sex, alcohol abuse, and infection by other hepatitic viruses, such as hepatitis B and Delta viruses, was also assessed. We found that mean age and male/female ratio were significantly higher in patients with HCC plus liver cirrhosis than in those with liver cirrhosis alone. Also, the prevalence of HCV infection was found to be higher in HCC patients compared to cirrhotics. Further, by means of multiple logistic regression, we evaluated the independent role of each variable in the development of HCC. Age, male sex, and to a lesser degree, HCV infection, as assessed by anti-HCV positivity, were the only risk factors which significantly correlated with the development of HCC. Moreover, when age and sex were excluded from the statistical model, HCV infection, but not HBV, HDV, and alcohol abuse, appeared to be associated with HCC. In conclusion, based on these data, age and male sex are the most important factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients. Hepatitis C virus, at least in the Mediterranean area, may play a role as an additive risk factor of HCC in patients suffering from liver cirrhosis."
6966,0.005,1.0000,"Although overt hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection promotes the onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients, the effect of occult HBV infection remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of occult HBV infection on the early-onset of HCC in HCV-infected patients. A total of 173 HCC patients with HCV infection were enrolled and classified into 2 groups according to the median age of HCC onset: the early-onset group (n=91; 61.1±5.6 years) and the late-onset group (n=82; 73.8±3.7 years). Independent factors associated with the early-onset of HCC were assessed by multivariate analysis. In the overall analysis, independent risk factors for the early-onset of HCC were the white blood cell count and alanine aminotransferase level, but not the presence of HBV DNA. In a stratification analysis according to albumin levels of ≥3.5 g/dl, the presence of HBV DNA was a significant independent risk factor for the early-onset of HCC (OR 145.18, 95% CI 1.38-15296.61, P=0.036), whereas the presence of antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen was not found to be a risk factor. The presence of HBV DNA was not a risk factor for the early-onset of HCC in the overall analysis. However, its presence was an independent factor for the early-onset of HCC in HCV-infected patients with an albumin level of ≥3.5 g/dl. Thus, occult HBV infection may accelerate hepatocarcino-genesis in HCV-infected patients with relatively low carcinogenic potential."
13297,0.005,1.0000,"Macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) is a cytokine that promotes monocyte differentiation and survival. When overexpressed, M-CSF contributes to pathology in a wide variety of diseases, including osteoporosis, obesity, certain human cancers, and in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, particularly with respect to monocyte/macrophage infection and the development of HIV-1 associated central nervous system disorders. In this study, our aim was to expand the current knowledge of M-CSF regulation, focusing on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), a transcription factor playing a prominent role during inflammation and HIV-1 infection. Our results suggest that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) promotes M-CSF secretion in primary macrophages and activates the -1310/+48 bp M-CSF promoter in Mono-Mac 1 cells. Inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway diminish this response. We identified four putative NF-κB and four CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein beta binding sites within the M-CSF promoter. Our findings, using promoter constructs mutated at individual NF-κB sites within the M-CSF promoter region, suggest that these sites are redundant with respect to NF-κB regulation. TNF-α treatment promoted NF-κB p65 binding to the M-CSF promoter in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treated U937 cells chronically infected with HIV-1 (U1 cells), but not in PMA treated uninfected U937 cells, suggesting that the presence of HIV-1 increases the NF-κB response. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that NF-κB induces M-CSF expression on a promoter level via multiple functional NF-κB binding sites and that this pathway is likely relevant in HIV-1 infection of macrophages."

A total of 317 patients who had received curative resection of pathologically proven small HCC (< or = 3 cm in diameter) were analyzed to ascertain the factors affecting recurrence. The median follow-up period was 33.7 months. Cumulative recurrence rates at 1, 3, and 5 years after resection were 23.5%, 49.5%, and 65.5%, respectively. Male sex, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) > or = 400 ng/mL, HBV DNA level > or = 4 log(10) copies/mL, prolonged prothrombin time, tumor size > or = 2 cm, microvascular invasion, absence of capsular formation, moderate/poor tumor differentiation, and absence of postoperative interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment were associated with increased cumulative risk of HCC recurrence. By multivariate analysis, HBV DNA level > or = 4 log(10) copies/mL (P < 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) 2.110), AFP > or = 400 ng/mL (P = 0.011, HR 1.574), microvascular invasion (P < 0.001, HR 1.767), and postoperative IFN-alpha treatment (P = 0.022, HR 0.562) remained to be independently associated with HCC recurrence. Those contributing to late recurrence (>2 years) were older age and HBV DNA level > or = 4 log(10) copies/mL. Patients with persistent HBV DNA level > or = 4 log(10) copies/mL at resection and follow-up had the highest recurrence risk (P < 0.001, HR 4.129).

Male gender is the apparent host factor when someone encounters with the severity of hepatitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the most polymorphic HLA class II allele, human leukocyte antigen-DRB1, with the severity of hepatitis in male carriers of hepatitis B virus. In this prospective cohort study, a total of 204 carriers of hepatitis B virus (131 men and 73 women) who have been followed-up for more than 1 year at the outpatient clinic of a university hospital were collected consecutively. Fifty carriers of hepatitis B virus (group I) with alanine aminotransferase <2x upper limit of normal (mean follow-up 83.6 months) were compared with 154 chronic hepatitis B patients (group II) with alanine aminotransferase >/=2x upper limit of normal (mean follow-up 81.3 months). Alleles of HLA-DRB1 were typed by the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization and genotypes of hepatitis B virus by melting curve analysis. HLA-DRB1*1101 was found in 18% of group I versus 8% of group II in male carriers (OR 0.23, P = 0.020, after adjustment for age) and 4% versus 9.4% in female carriers (P = 0.094). In male carriers harboring DRB1*1101, the distribution of hepatitis B viral genotype was comparable between the two groups. HLA-DRB1*1101 correlates with less severe hepatitis in Taiwanese male carriers of hepatitis B virus."
3447,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) and antibody to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was determined in the serum specimens of 288 patients treated surgically in the orthopaedic department of an urban public teaching hospital. The cumulative risk of HBV, HCV and HIV seroconversion for an orthopaedic surgeon during the surgical career span was calculated. We found that 1.4%, 3.1% and 1.7% of patients were seropositive for HBsAg, HCV antibody and HIV antibody, respectively. Seropositivity was neither associated with age nor with trauma, whereas male patients had a greater likelihood of seropositivity. Risk factor assessment did not prove to be discriminating in identifying which patients may pose a potential exposure risk. This study supports the concept of universal infection control precautions for orthopaedic surgeons regardless of the patients' risk factor or serologic status."

Among 488 Japanese hemophiliacs, 165 (33.8%) were seropositive and were infected by the injection of factor VIII or factor IX manufactured from American sources. The rates of infection among hemophiliacs were 21.8% (19/87) and 36.8% (43/117), respectively for 1984 and 1985. Sera of 10,272 volunteer blood donors were all negative for anti-HIV. There have been 16 confirmed AIDS cases in Japan consisting of 8 male homosexuals and 8 hemophiliacs, so it can be concluded HIV infections have exclusively occurred among male homosexuals and hemophiliacs.

Background staining of 13 HLA-A*02-negative patients showed that the frequency of CD8(+) T cells was <0.01%. Of the 28 HLA-A*02-positive patients, blood samples from 26 stained positive at least once the Gag tetramer (mean CD8(+) T cells, 0.87%; range, 0.1%-3.9%), and blood samples from 21 stained positive for the Pol tetramer (mean CD8(+) T cells, 0.59%; range, 0.1%-5.5%). The tetramer-binding cells were CD28(-), CD45RA(-), CD45RO(+), HLA-DR(+), and CD69(-) T lymphocytes. HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells can be detected easily in peripheral blood of HIV-infected children, using HLA tetramers combined with HIV peptides.

13413,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-related stigma has been linked to avoidance of health care services and suboptimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, less is known about concerns of stigma related specifically to the taking of ART in uptake of treatment. This study examines experiences of HIV treatment-related stigma and assesses if these experiences are associated with ART uptake, independent of general HIV-related stigma. People living with HIV (PLHIV; n = 697) were targeted to complete an online questionnaire measuring perceived HIV- and treatment-related stigma, social support, self-esteem, resilience, psychological distress, health satisfaction and quality of life. Findings suggest that experiences of general and treatment-related stigma were common, and that participants appear to experience greater stigma related to taking HIV treatment than general stigma associated with HIV. Neither general nor treatment-related stigma uniquely impacted HIV treatment uptake. Instead, treatment uptake was associated with being older (adjusted OR 1.05; 95% CIs: 1.03, 1.08), greater duration of HIV infection (adjusted OR 1.07; 95% CIs: 1.03-1.11) and having greater health satisfaction (adjusted OR 1.28; 95% CIs: 1.03, 1.59). Findings highlight that concerns around taking HIV treatment can be an added source of stigma for PLHIV, however other factors may be greater contributors to the likelihood of taking HIV treatment. "

In Brazil, the Roraima State is the third in the Northern region regarding the number of hepatitis B cases. On the other hand, few data on HBV genotyping and phylogenetic analysis are available. The purpose of this study is to characterize the HBV genotypes circulating in Roraima State. Of the 113 chronic hepatitis B patients enrolled in this study, 40 were HBV-DNA positive. A fragment of 280 bp (S gene) was amplified by PCR and submitted to nucleotide sequencing. A dataset containing the viral sequences obtained in this study, plus 130 obtained from GenBank was used for genotyping by phylogenetic analysis. The HBV subgenotype distribution found was A1 (62.5%), A2 (7.5%), D2, D3, D4 (2.5%), F2a (12.5%), and F3 (10%). We characterized the genotypes and subgenotypes of HBV circulating among patients in the State of Roraima. In addition, our study shows for the first time the HBV/F3 genotype circulating in Brazil. In conclusion, our findings showed a high diversity of HBV genotypes in Roraima, which is also found in other Brazilian geographical regions."
2905,0.005,1.0000,"As part of the multidisciplinary effort to characterize the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, the cell-surface phenotypes of lymphocytes from a cohort of homosexual men were analyzed in detail and related to clinical and laboratory parameters associated with HIV-1 infection. The present study represents a cross-sectional analysis of coded specimens from 153 homosexual men, of whom 74 were seronegative and 79 seropositive for HIV-1. Fewer circulating B lymphocytes (CD19+) were found in HIV-1-seropositive subjects relative to a seronegative reference group. HIV seropositivity was not associated with decreased numbers of CD8+ T cells or activated T cells, which suggests that the number of circulating B cells specifically decreased. In addition to CD19, B cells were measured by CD20 and CD21 in a subset of subjects, and decreases in circulating CD20+ and CD21+ B cells were also apparent in HIV-1-seropositive subjects. The decrease in B-cell numbers was present at the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection (asymptomatic, clinically silent) and became more pronounced at more advanced stages of HIV-1 infection. The absolute B-cell numbers correlated with absolute CD4+ cell numbers (r = 0.59, p less than 0.001). These data suggest that HIV-1 infection is associated with progressive, selective decreases in the numbers of circulating CD4+ T cells and B cells."

To describe the use of medicinal herbs among acquired immunodeficiency syndrome clinic patients and to investigate possible toxic effects, we interviewed 114 randomly selected patients attending a university-based acquired immunodeficiency syndrome clinic and performed a structured review of the literature to identify potential adverse effects of herbal use. Twenty-five participants (22%) reported using one or more herbal products in the past 3 months. Of those taking herbs, six (24%) were unable to identify the herb that they had used. The mean number of herbal tablets taken was 4.5 tablets per day, and 12 patients (48%) reported taking herbs for longer than 90 days. The median cost to patients for their herbs was $18 per month. Of those taking herbs, five (20%) stated that their primary medical provider was unaware of their herb use, and four (16%) were involved in clinical drug trials while using herbs. Several patients reported taking herbs in doses at which potential adverse effects were identified in our literature review. These adverse effects include dermatitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathies, altered mental status, hepatotoxicity, and electrolyte disturbances. Seven patients (28%) reported experiencing symptoms that could have been caused by one or more of the herbal products that they were taking. Physicians and clinical investigators need to inquire about patients' use of herbs. Patient care and clinical trials could be distorted because pharmacologic effects of herbs can resemble commonly occurring symptoms in human immunodeficiency virus disorders as well as side effects of prescribed or investigational medications."
18952,0.005,1.0000,"Designing an effective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine will rely on understanding which variants, from among the myriad of circulating HIV-1 strains, are most commonly transmitted and determining whether such variants have an Achilles heel. Here we show that heterosexually acquired subtype A HIV-1 envelopes have signature sequences that include shorter V1-V2 loop sequences and fewer predicted N-linked glycosylation sites relative to the overall population of circulating variants. In contrast, recently transmitted subtype B variants did not, and this was true for cases where the major risk factor was homosexual contact, as well as for cases where it was heterosexual contact. This suggests that selection during HIV-1 transmission may vary depending on the infecting subtype. There was evidence from 23 subtype A-infected women for whom there was longitudinal data that those who were infected with viruses with fewer potential N-linked glycosylation sites in V1-V2 had lower viral set point levels. Thus, our study also suggests that the extent of glycosylation in the infecting virus could impact disease progression."

In this study 149 antiretroviral-naïve seropositive subjects in Nigeria (SP, 92 women and 57 men) and 58 seronegative (SN, 38 women and 20 men) were administered neuropsychological testing that assessed 7 ability domains. From the neuropsychological test scores was calculated a global deficit score (GDS), a measure of overall NCI. Percentages of circulating monocytes and plasma HIV RNA, soluble CD163 and soluble CD14 levels were also assessed. HIV SP women were found to be younger, more educated and had higher CD4+ T cell counts and borderline higher viral load measures than SP men. On the neuropsychological testing, SP women were more impaired in speed of information processing and verbal fluency and had a higher mean GDS than SN women. Compared to SP men, SP women were also more impaired in speed of information processing and verbal fluency as well as on tests of learning and memory. Numbers of circulating monocytes and plasma sCD14 and sCD163 levels were significantly higher for all SP versus all SN individuals and were also higher for SP women and for SP men versus their SN counterparts. Among SP women, soluble CD14 levels were slightly higher than for SP men, and SP women had higher viral load measurements and were more likely to have detectable virus than SP men. Higher sCD14 levels among SP women correlated with more severe global impairment, and higher viral load measurements correlated with higher monocyte numbers and sCD14 and sCD14 levels, associations that were not observed for SP men. These studies suggest that the risk of developing NCI differ for HIV infected women and men in Nigeria and, for women, may be linked to effects from higher plasma levels of HIV driving activation of circulating monocytes.

Epidemiologic studies vary in design from longitudinal to cross-sectional, with varying periods of follow-up or retrospective history of exposure to STD. The major difficulty in assessing the results of past work centers on the validity and precision of widely used measures of association, such as relative risk (RR) and odds ratio (OR), in situations in which common behavior (e.g., different facets of sexual behavior) underpins the acquisition of both the STD cofactor and HIV."

The cases were 3 times more likely to have a history of ever having had another STD than the controls: multivariate conditional logistic regression showed that, after controlling for sexual behaviour, for known sexual contact with an HIV infected individual or AIDS patient or with a resident from a high HIV prevalence area, area of residence and for year of test, a history of gonorrhoea, syphilis, hepatitis B, genital herpes or genital warts were all significantly associated with HIV-1 seropositive status.

Although researchers have identified multiple correlates of adherence, the field remains relatively atheoretical. The authors propose a cognitive-affective model of medication adherence based on social support theory and research. Structural equation modeling of longitudinal survey data from 136 mainly African American and Puerto Rican men and women with HIV/AIDS provided preliminary support for a modified model. Specifically, baseline data indicated social support was associated with less negative affect and greater spirituality, which, in turn, were associated with self-efficacy to adhere. Self-efficacy to adhere at baseline predicted self-reported adherence at 3 months, which predicted chart-extracted viral load at 6 months. The findings have relevance for theory building, intervention development, and clinical practice."

The medical records of 293 HIV-infected adult patients who visited either of two urban health clinics in New Haven, Connecticut, from June 2003 to December 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. Changes in mean CD4 lymphocyte counts and undetectable viral loads were compared before and after the initiation of HAART for patients categorized into one of four substance abuse groups: history of neither alcohol abuse nor IDU, alcohol abuse only, IDU only, or both. Unadjusted mean improvements in CD4 count for the four groups were 136, 97, 20, and 27, respectively. In a linear regression model adjusted for age, gender, and baseline CD4 count, history of IDU only (P = 0.037) and a combination of alcohol abuse and IDU (P = 0.038) were associated with a lesser increase in CD4 count after HAART compared with those with neither alcohol nor IDU. No significant associations were found between substance abuse history and changes in detectable viral load. Our results show that many patients at urban health clinics have a history of either injection drug use or alcohol abuse, and that injection drug use is negatively associated with the immunologic response to HAART in urban HIV-infected individuals. This study highlights the importance for clinicians of understanding the negative associations of substance abuse with the treatment response of HIV-infected patients at urban health centers."
7927,0.005,1.0000,"The control of the spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection within dialysis units has been an important goal in the management of patients on regular dialysis but infected patients continue to enter the dialysis system. It is evident that HBV viraemia in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients on dialysis is low but it remains unclear whether haemodialysis per se can contribute to viral load reduction in such patients. HBV DNA was determined in 40 HBsAg-positive patients on maintenance haemodialysis immediately before and at the end of a 4-h haemodialysis session. The same measurements were repeated 48 and 72 h later. Twenty (50%) of 40 HBsAg-positive patients had detectable HBV DNA in serum. Detectable HBV DNA in serum was not predicted by demographic, clinical or biochemical parameters. HBV load decreased in the majority of patients after haemodialysis, although the difference was not significant (29 390 +/- 48 820 vs 23 862.8 +/- 4 350 copies/mL, NS). There was a strong relationship between mean HBV DNA levels before dialysis and absolute reduction of HBV DNA during haemodialysis sessions (r = 0.75, P = 0.0001). No difference occurred in the magnitude of change in HBV DNA titre when comparing cellulosic to synthetic membranes. Haemodialysis per se leads to a reduction in HBV load in HBsAg-chronic carriers on maintenance dialysis. This phenomenon could explain the low viral loads in these patients. Prospective studies are in progress to identify the mechanisms responsible for reduction in HBV load during haemodialysis."

Eighty-one were HIV infected (0.54%; 95% CI, 0.43-0.67), 60 were on hemodialysis, and 21 were on peritoneal dialysis. The mean (range) age was 45 (28-73) years. Seventy-two percent were men and 33% were former drug users. The mean (range) time of HIV infection was 11 (1-27) years and time on dialysis was 4.6 (0.4-25) years. ESRD was due to glomerulonephritis (36%) and diabetes (15%). HIV-associated nephropathy was not reported. Eighty-five percent were on HAART, 76.5% had a CD4 T cell count above 200 cells, and 73% had undetectable viral load. Thirty-nine percent of patients met criteria for inclusion on the renal transplant (RT) waiting list but only 12% were included. Sixty-one percent had HCV coinfection. HCV-coinfected patients had a longer history of HIV, more previous AIDS events, parenteral transmission as the most common risk factor for acquiring HIV infection, and less access to the RT waiting list (p < 0.05).

16555,0.005,1.0000,"Alcohol abuse is the most common and costly form of drug abuse in the United States. It is well known that alcohol abuse contributes to risky behaviors associated with greater incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. As HIV has become a more chronic disease since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, it is expected that alcohol use disorders will have an adverse effect on the health of HIV-infected patients. The biomedical consequences of acute and chronic alcohol abuse are multisystemic. Based on what is currently known of the comorbid and pathophysiological conditions resulting from HIV infection in people with alcohol use disorders, chronic alcohol abuse appears to alter the virus infectivity, the immune response of the host, and the progression of disease and tissue injury, with specific impact on disease progression. The combined insult of alcohol abuse and HIV affects organ systems, including the central nervous system, the immune system, the liver, heart, and lungs, and the musculoskeletal system. Here we outline the major pathological consequences of alcohol abuse in the HIV-infected individual, emphasizing its impact on immunomodulation, erosion of lean body mass associated with AIDS wasting, and lipodystrophy. We conclude that interventions focused on reducing or avoiding alcohol abuse are likely to be important in decreasing morbidity and improving outcomes in people living with HIV/AIDS. "

We assessed the outcome of HIV/HBV-coinfected patients exposed to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) including anti-HBV active drugs. Baseline and follow-up plasma HBVDNA and HIV-RNA levels, HBV serological markers, and CD4 counts were longitudinally evaluated in all HBsAg(+) individuals with HIV infection on regular follow-up at an urban HIV reference clinic. Out of 79 HBsAg(+) chronic carriers identified, 39 (50%) were HBeAg(+). Lamivudine (3TC) alone had been received by 37% of patients, while 3TC plus tenofovir (concomitantly or consecutively) had been taken by 58% of them. The median follow-up was of 52 months. Loss of HBeAg or HBsAg occurred in 28% (10/36) and 13% (10/75) of patients, respectively. In multivariate analysis, only undetectable plasma HIV-RNA levels [OR 4.58 (95% CI 1.25-16.78); p = 0.02] and greater CD4 gains on HAART [OR 1.003 (95% CI 1.000-1.006); p = 0.03] were associated with undetectable serum HBV-DNA at the end of follow-up. Anti-HBV active HAART makes it possible to achieve HBsAg clearance, anti-HBe seroconversion, and suppression of HBV replication in a substantial proportion of HBV/HIV-coinfected patients, particularly in those with complete HIV suppression and greater immune recovery.

A cross-sectional community-based population study of 993 Japanese residents was conducted. Based on anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA levels, 50 subjects were assigned to the spontaneous-clearance group, 155 to the chronic-infection group, and 788 to the control group. Logistic regression analysis was done to examine the roles of the IL28B rs8099917 genotype and sex. To analyze the interactions between these factors, an ""IL28B rs809991 genotype × sex"" interaction term was included in the multivariate analysis. Significantly more subjects in the spontaneous-clearance group than in the chronic-infection group had the favorable IL28B rs8099917 genotype and were female. Multivariate logistic regression analysis extracted the favorable IL28B rs8099917 TT genotype (odds ratio [OR] 9.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.16-40.83, P = 0.003) and female sex (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.16-4.45, P = 0.017) as factors contributing to the spontaneous clearance of HCV.

Since high titers of circulating hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) may be essential to exhaust the host anti-HBV immune response and they cannot be significantly reduced by current drugs, new antiviral strategies aiming to suppress serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) could help restore virus-specific immune responses and promote the eradication of the virus. As an alternative strategy, immunotherapy with HBsAg-specific antibodies has shown some direct HBsAg suppression effects in several preclinical and clinical trial studies. However, most described previously HBsAg-specific antibodies only had very short-term HBsAg suppression effects in CHB patients and animal models mimicking persistent HBV infection. More-potent antibodies with long-lasting HBsAg clearance effects are required for the development of the clinical application of antibody-mediated immunotherapy for CHB treatment. Our recent study described a novel mAb E6F6 that targets a unique epitope on HBsAg. It could durably suppress the levels of HBsAg and HBV DNA via Fcγ receptor-dependent phagocytosis in vivo. In this commentary, we summarize the current research progress, including the therapeutic roles and mechanisms of antibody-mediated HBV clearance as well as the epitope-determined therapeutic potency of the antibody. These insights may provide some clues and guidance to facilitate the development of therapeutic antibodies against persistent viral infection."

Serum sICAM-1 levels in asymptomatic HIV-1-positive patients were significantly increased in comparison to HIV-negative controls. Moreover, they were significantly higher in HIV-1-positive patients with AIDS-defining diseases than in the asymptomatic HIV-1-positive group. In subgroups of patients with neurological disease, the highest serum values were found in HIV encephalopathy. CSF levels of sICAM-1 were elevated only in HIV-1-positive patients with neurological disease mainly due to passive diffusion through a defective blood-brain barrier. An sICAM-1 index was calculated as a measure for intrathecal production of sICAM-1 but showed no significant differences between patients with and without neurological involvement. However, increased levels of the sICAM-1 index were found in some patients with opportunistic CNS infection of bacterial or fungal origin. Serum and CSF levels of sICAM-1 correlated with neopterin levels, a marker of interferon-gamma-mediated macrophage activation and CSF sICAM-1 levels were inversely correlated to numbers of CD4+ T cells. Elevated serum sICAM-1 levels already in asymptomatic HIV-1-positive individuals add to the evidence for an early immune activation in HIV infection. With the further increase of serum and CSF s-ICAM-1 in patients with AIDS-defining diseases sICAM-1 could serve as a new surrogate marker similar to neopterin."

Disease progression was defined as decrease in CD4+ cells to < 200 (14 events). At enrollment, provirus copy number was associated with CD4+ cell count and percentage, serum IgA, and p24 antigenemia. Elevated provirus copy number above 20 allowed identification of patients at high risk of a subsequently decreasing CD4+ cell count, even after adjusting for baseline CD4+ cell count (P = .003).

The greatest down-regulation of both receptors occurred in the HIV/TB group. Furthermore, associated with this reduced expression of IL-8 receptors was impairment of both intracellular calcium flux and migration of PMNL in response to IL-8 in a group of HIV/TB patients compared with that in healthy persons."
12857,0.005,1.0000,"Clinical, virologic, and immunologic responses to treatment that contained either indinavir or nelfinavir (both regimens included zidovudine and lamivudine) were determined in 32 children infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) who participated for >/= 96 weeks in a prospective, open, uncontrolled multicenter trial. The pharmacokinetics of indinavir and of nelfinavir were determined and showed large interindividual differences. After 96 weeks of therapy, 69% and 50% of the patients had an HIV-1 RNA load that was below the HIV assays' detection limits of 500 and 40 copies/mL, respectively. Virologic failure was associated with poor compliance and younger age (independent of baseline virus load and receipt of pretreatment). Relative CD4 cell counts increased significantly in relation to the median of the age-specific reference value, from a median of 44% at baseline to 94% after 96 weeks. In a high percentage of the children, clinical, virologic, and immunologic response rates to combination therapy were optimal during the initial 2 years of therapy."
1751,0.005,1.0000,"This study presents immunophenotypic variation in lymphocyte populations obtained from peripheral blood and lymph nodes from individuals with early HIV disease who were enrolled in a prospective, open-label study. At baseline, there was a significantly greater percentage of B cells and significantly smaller percentage of CD8+ cells in lymph nodes compared with peripheral blood. Evaluation of lymphocyte phenotypic markers of function, maturation, and activation at baseline revealed a significantly higher percentage of activated CD4+ cells in lymph nodes compared with peripheral blood, whereas the percentages of activated CD8+ cells were similar in both compartments. After an 8-week period of randomly assigned treatment, peripheral blood phenotypic marker changes included (1) a reduced proportion of activated cells (HLA-DR+) in antiretroviral-naive patients who received zidovudine (ZDV), and (2) as increased proportion of ""naive"" cells (CD45RA+) in individuals, previously administered ZDV alone, who received ZDV and didanosine (ddI) therapy. The lymph node phenotypic marker analysis showed no significant changes over the 8-week treatment period. Overall, the study demonstrates significant differences in lymphocyte subsets from lymph nodes compared with peripheral blood and suggests that further studies be performed to determine the functional significance of these phenotypic subsets."
580,0.005,1.0000,"To evaluate the incidence, characteristics, and risk factors of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, we conducted was a prospective observational study of inpatients with HIV disease. The study was conducted in a public teaching hospital affiliated with the University of California, San Francisco. We reviewed daily the hospital records of all eligible inpatients throughout their hospitalization for potential ADRs. Potential ADRs were independently evaluated by two of the authors with regard to the extent of their causal association(s) with implicated drug(s) using a previously validated algorithm. Type (A, augmented; B, bizarre) and severity (mild, moderate, severe) were also evaluated. Among 495 patient admissions involving 390 eligible patients, 173 potential ADRs were identified, of which 118 (68.2%) had a probable or definite causal relationship to the implicated drugs. These probable or definite ADRs occurred among 79 (20%) eligible patients; 82 ADRs (69.5%) were classified as augmented (type A) and 36 (30.5%) were classified as bizarre (type B) reactions. Skin rash was the most frequent (17%) ADR encountered. Of the medications causing ADRs, 70% were antimicrobial drugs. Significant independent risk factors for developing ADRs included advanced stage of HIV disease, intake of a greater number of medications, and longer hospital stay. A high percentage of patients with HIV disease developed ADRs. Skin rash was the single most common kind of ADR. Advanced stage of illness and prolonged drug exposure were the only risk factors for ADRs."
14945,0.005,1.0000,"The long-term impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on HIV-1 infected children is not well known. The Danish Paediatric HIV Cohort Study includes all patients <16 y of age with HIV-1 infection in Denmark. We report the complete follow-up from 1996 to 2005 of 49 perinatally infected children treated with HAART. Initial HAART included 2 nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors in combination with either a protease inhibitor (n =38) or a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (n =12). 19 (39%) patients were previously treated with mono- or dual therapy. Baseline characteristics were median CD4 percentage 14% and HIV-RNA viral load 4.9 log(10). Within the first 12 weeks of therapy approximately 60% achieved HIV-RNA viral load <500 copies/ml, and this remained stable for up to 8 y, although many children changed the components of HAART. The proportion of children with CD4 percentage >25% increased to 60-70% over the y of treatment. For the total cohort, 245 patient-y of observation were available with only 1 death. During our observation period there were no signs of a waning impact. The challenge remains to maintain a high adherence to therapy as the children grow into adolescence and develop more independence from family and health care staff."
3578,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the thymic contribution to immune reconstitution during antiretroviral therapy (ART), T cell receptor gene rearrangement excision circles (TRECs) were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CD4 cells from 33 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected children monitored for 96 weeks after ART initiation. Baseline TREC levels were associated positively with baseline CD4 cell percentage and inversely with age and HIV-1 RNA load. During therapy, TREC level changes in PBMC and CD4 cells were fairly comparable. TREC level changes were inversely related to baseline CD4 cell percentage and positively associated with CD4 cell percentage increases, the main source being naive CD4 cells. TREC changes were independent of age and baseline HIV-1 RNA load; however, HIV-1 suppression was independently associated with smaller TREC changes. Thymic output appears to be the main source of CD4 cell repopulation in children receiving ART. Recovery of thymic function is independent of age and influenced by the status of peripheral CD4 cell depletion and HIV-1 suppression."
3746,0.005,1.0000,"To identify the prognostic significance of hemophilia- and virus-related factors, the authors undertook a survival analysis among 644 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects enrolled in the Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study between 1985 and 1993. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was the leading cause of death, followed by hemorrhage and hepatic disease. Adverse prognostic factors included older age and CD4-positive lymphocyte values below 14 percent either at entry (age-adjusted mortality rate ratio (RR) = 6.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4-12.1) or after entry (time-dependent RR = 4.2, 95% CI 2.6-6.7); indeterminate antibody responses to hepatitis C virus (RR = 3.0, 95% CI 1.8-5.0); and inhibitory antibodies to factor VIII concentrates (RR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.1). Indeterminate hepatitis C virus status was associated with mortality from hepatic disease but not with AIDS mortality. Factors that were not prognostic included duration of HIV infection, hepatitis B virus infection, and other hemophilia variables. These findings suggest that fatal liver disease among coinfected subjects with an indeterminate hepatitis C virus status is probably related to an insufficient humoral response secondary to HIV immune dysfunction and that the risk of death among HIV-infected subjects is best evaluated with age and duration of low CD4 percentage."
12739,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is, to a great extent, a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Its diffusion among the heterosexual population is still limited. STD treatment centres are particularly well organized to watch this diffusion. At the STD centre of the Saint-Louis hospital, Paris, we conducted a 6-week prospective study concerning the systematic detection of HIV-1 infection in 240 consecutive female out-patients in 1988, and in 504 male out-patients in 1989. The results obtained were as follow: 5/240 women (2.1 percent) and 19/504 men (3.8 percent) were seropositive for HIV-1. Out of these 24 subjects, 15 did not know they were seropositive. Predictive factors for seropositivity were male homosexuality, addiction to heroin and, in women, drug addicts as sex partners. Altogether, 23 of the 24 seropositive subjects had the classical risk factors for HIV-1 infection. None of the 744 subjects in this study were HIV-2 seropositive, and only 1 out of 504 men was HTLV-1 seropositive. We conclude that the prevalence of HIV-1 infection was high in our centre, and this prompts us to suggest that the serological test should be proposed to all out-patients and that patient's education and preventive measures should be organized by STD centres, even though the infection is still limited to patients at a particularly high risk (drug addicts, homosexuals, country of origin)."
787,0.005,1.0000,"From June 1986 to March 1990, a prospective seroprevalence survey and questionnaire of individuals at risk for HIV infection was conducted with volunteers in Winnipeg. Of 610 individuals enrolled, 146 were injected drug users (IDU). Fifteen IDU were in a methadone treatment program and all were seronegative. Three of 131 remaining IDU were HIV-1 seropositive (2.3%), a rate similar to 2.2% positive (20+ of 927) in diagnostic specimens from IDU tested in the province. Demographics and behaviour of 131 IDU were compared with 335 individuals, of whom 112 were gay/bisexual [24 of whom also had sexually transmitted diseases (STD)] and 223 heterosexuals who had STD. Males enrolled were significantly older than females. Multivariate analysis showed that factors independently associated with IDU were: a younger age, less education, mental health counselling, unemployment, and a history of jaundice or hepatitis. Drugs most commonly used were Ritalin/Talwin, cocaine, and heroin. Over 90% of individuals admitted to sharing needles. In spite of the low seroprevalence of HIV-1 infections, these individuals are important for the potential spread of HIV because of multiple means of acquiring and transmitting HIV and a high rate of needle sharing."
11179,0.005,1.0000,"Intravenous heroin abusers comprise a high risk group for hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) infection. Chronic alcoholics with liver disease (LD) also comprise a high risk group for HBV infection whereas the frequency of antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) ranges from 27-42.6%. In this study, HBV and HCV infection markers were determined in alcoholic patients with (83 patients) or without LD (68 patients) in order to assess the prevalence of these markers (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAb and anti-HCV). The reason for the study was a lack of established data in this group of patients in Greece. The disease control groups consisted of 70 non-alcoholic hospitalized patients and 60 heroin addicts, whereas 1342 healthy blood donors were also investigated. Our results showed significantly increased prevalence of HBV infection markers in chronic alcoholic patients compared to healthy controls and non-alcoholic hospitalized patients. The findings were independent of the presence or absence of LD. In contrast to heroin addicts, where anti-HCV antibodies were observed in 90%, there was no difference in the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies in chronic alcoholics (with or without LD), nonalcoholic hospitalized patients or healthy controls. In conclusion, we found that in this area of north-western Greece, chronic alcoholics, independent of the presence of LD, comprise a high risk group for HBV infection but very rarely have HCV infection. The latter finding may reflect technical or socio-economic differences regarding the lifestyle of our patients, and our population in general."
3687,0.005,1.0000,"In April 1987, antibody to HIV-1 was determined in sera from 764 subjects from the Mwanza region in the north of Tanzania. Patients with a clinical suspicion of AIDS were HIV-1 antibody-positive in 65.4% (34 out of 52) and patients admitted for pulmonary tuberculosis in 25% (9 out of 36). In patients attending general outpatient departments (OPD), HIV antibody was found in 12.5% of 48 patients with a history of sexually transmitted disease (STD) and in 10.6% of 141 patients without such a history. In healthy subjects, HIV-1 antibody was present in 6% of 332 pregnant women and in 4.5% of 155 blood donors. Of the blood donors, pregnant women and OPD patients without a history of STD (628 subjects in all), 465 belonged to the rural population of the region and the majority were peasants. In this subgroup, the HIV-1 antibody prevalence was 4.8% in blood donors, 4.9% in pregnant women and 10.3% in OPD patients. This indicates a spread of HIV-1 among the population in this part of Tanzania. Further studies are needed to determine what proportion of the population is affected."
16583,0.005,1.0000,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends sexually transmitted disease (STD) screening among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons as a means of HIV prevention. HIV-infected persons in care may be an important target group in which to conduct regular STD screening to prevent enhanced transmission of HIV. We conducted STD screening for syphilis and two causes of urethritis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea, among 447 HIV-infected persons at two busy, urban clinics in San Francisco: a general HIV acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) care clinic and a methadone maintenance clinic. There were no new cases of syphilis identified and only two prevalent cases of chlamydia. While STD screening was feasible and acceptable in this population, the benefits of screening for asymptomatic gonococcal and chlamydial infection remain to be determined. Because these two pathogens only cause about 20% of urethritis, broader screening tests for urethritis, e.g., leukocyte esterase or urine microscopy, may be more useful. Finally, this study reaffirms the notion that local data should be used to evaluate national screening recommendations."
10630,0.005,1.0000,"The heterosexual transmission of subtype E human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was evaluated in 467 couples in Thailand in whom the man was HIV-1 positive and the woman had no risk factors for HIV other than sex with her infected partner. At baseline, 216 (46.3%) of the 467 women were positive for HIV-1; prevalence of HIV among women was 52.2% when their male partners had CD4+ lymphocyte counts of <200 cells/microL, 45.9% in women whose partners had counts of 200-499 micro/L, and 39.2% in women whose partners had counts of >/=500/microL. Women were twice as likely to be HIV positive if their partners had a history of a sexually transmitted disease (STD); however, their HIV prevalence was 29% among couples who had no STD history. It appears that female partners of men infected with subtype E HIV-1 are at high risk of infection even when the man's CD4+ cell count is relatively high. A high rate of STDs may contribute significantly to this risk [corrected]."

The detection of these mutations (including minor mutant subpopulations) was achieved by direct sequencing, whose sensitivity for minor mutant subpopulations identification was confirmed by clone sequencing. Patients enrolled were infected with either genotype B (46.35%) or C (53.65%) HBV identified by routine tests in our laboratory. The A1762T/G1764A or G1896A mutations were detected in 125specimens (125/192, 65.10%), in which 77 (77/125, 61.60%) existed as subpopulations. The A1762T/G1764A mutations were found to be more prevalent in genotype C than that in genotype B HBV [62.14% (64/103) vs. 20.22% (18/89), P<0.0001]. There is no statistically significant link between G1896A and genotypes. The emergence of A1762T/G1764A mutations was also found to be associated with an older age, an elevated ALT/AST level, and a lower HBsAg level in serum [wild-type vs. mutant: 4.57 (3.46-5.42) vs. 3.93 (2.51-5.36), P<0.0001]. In conclusion, HBV basal core promoter mutations A1762T/G1764A are associated with genotype C and a low serum HBsAg level in chronically-infected HBeAg-positive Chinese patients."
17037,0.005,1.0000,"The nucleotide transition G-->A is known as a hypermutation due to its high prevalence in HIV-1 and other pathogens. However, the contribution of the G-->A transition in the generation of drug resistance mutations is unknown . Our objective was to ascertain the rate of nucleotide substitutions in protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) in both untreated and treated HIV-1 patients. Genotypic analysis was performed on viruses from both treated and untreated patients with subtype B infections. Nucleotide genomic diversity was compared with a consensus subtype B reference virus. Then, the prevalence of resistance-associated mutations in different subgroups of treated patients was evaluated in relation to the patterns of nucleotide transitions. In untreated patients (n = 50) G-->A was most prevalent, followed by A-->G, C-->T, and T-->C transitions. In treated patients (n = 51), the prevalence of A-->G was similar to that of G-->A. Among mutations that confer resistance to antiretroviral drugs, M184V was present in 76% of treated patients and K70R in 31% (A-->G transitions). Other frequent mutations in RT included T215Y (C-->A and A-->T substitutions), which was prevalent in 31% of treated patients. In PR, a L90M (T-->A substitution) was prevalent in 47% of protease inhibitor (PI)-treated patients. In conclusion, the G-->A transition was most prevalent in RT and PR among untreated patients. In contrast, A-->G was the most prevalent transition in patients treated with antiretroviral drugs."
18677,0.005,1.0000,"The critical events in clearance or persistence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are unknown but likely to be determined early in acute infection. Type 1 and type 2 cytokine production was assessed by HCV peptide ELISpot and multiplex in vitro cytokine production assays in longitudinally collected samples from 20 untreated participants enrolled in the Australian Trial in Acute Hepatitis C (ATAHC); a prospective cohort of acute HCV infection (77% injecting drug users, IDU). Significantly higher interleukin-10 (IL-10) production (P = 0.048), in the relative absence of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and IL-2 production, was present early in HCV infection in those who progressed to chronic infection. In contrast, viral clearance was associated with a greater magnitude and broader specificity of IFN-γ (magnitude P < 0.001, breadth P = 0.004) and IL-2 responses, in the relative absence of IL-10. Early IL-10 production was correlated with higher HCV RNA level at baseline (P = 0.046) and week 12 (P = 0.018), while IFN-γ and IL-2 production was inversely correlated with HCV RNA level at baseline (IFN-γ P = 0.020, IL-2 P = 0.050) and week 48 (IFN-γ P = 0.045, IL-2 P = 0.026). Intracellular staining (ICS) indicated the HCV-specific IFN-γ response was primarily from CD8(+) T cells and NK cells, whereas IL-10 production was predominantly from monocytes, with a subset of IL-10 producing CD8(+) T cells present only in those who progressed to chronic infection. IL-10, an immunoregulatory cytokine, appears to play a key role in progression to chronic HCV infection."

A sample of 851 out-of-treatment IDUs was recruited in Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, between 2003 and 2005. Participants were tested for HIV and HCV antibodies. Demographic, drug use, and injection practice data were collected via interviews. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analysis. Participants had a mean age of 40 years and 74% are male, 63% are African American, 29% are non-Hispanic white, and 8% are of other race/ethnicity. Overall, 42% of participants had ever used an HDSS and 12% had shared one. HIV prevalence was 5% among IDUs who had never used an HDSS compared with 16% among IDUs who had shared one. The HIV model used a propensity score approach to adjust for differences between IDUs who had used an HDSS and those who had never used one. The HCV models included all potential confounders as covariates. A history of sharing HDSSs was associated with prevalent HIV (odds ratio=2.50; 95% confidence interval=1.01, 6.15). Use and sharing of HDSSs were also associated with increased odds of HCV infection. Prospective studies are needed to determine if sharing HDSSs is associated with increased HIV and HCV incidence among IDUs."

Infection, defined as the presence of HCV RNA in a serum sample collected from an infant at any time during follow-up, was detected in six of 63 (9.5%) infants born to HCV antibody-positive viraemic mothers. No mother who was HCV RNA negative at delivery transmitted HCV to her infant. Hepatitis C virus antibodies became undetectable in uninfected infants by 15 months, but persisted in all HCV-infected infants throughout follow-up. An abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was observed on at least one occasion in all HCV-infected infants and in six occasions in uninfected infants. Two of the six HCV-infected infants became HCV RNA negative during follow-up by 27 and 29 months. Both of these infants had a large ALT elevation (mean peak ALT 398U l-1) at around 12 months of age. Analysis of a range of potential risk factors revealed that maternal HCV RNA load was important in predicting transmission, but suggested that other factors play a role in perinatal transmission from mother to child. No difference was found between mothers who transmitted HCV to their infants and those who did not for HCV genotype, duration of drug use, duration of methadone use, methadone dose, history of alcohol abuse, past hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, mode of delivery, maternal and gestational age, birth weight and incidence of breast-feeding. Mothers who transmitted HCV to their infants had a longer duration between membrane rupture and delivery than the mothers who did not transmit (P = 0.03). HCV RNA was not detected in breast milk and colostrum samples from 38 viraemic mothers, including two who transmitted HCV to their infant."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the level of exposure to different risk factors associated with HCV transmission among a group of co-infected patients and to characterize the genotypic distribution of HCV in this cluster. A series of 100 HIV-HCV co-infected patients was analysed. The data to be analysed were collected from specific laboratory tests. Information was collected through a questionnaire. HCV genotyping was carried out by sequencing the 5' non-coding region of HCV. Chi-square and Fischer association tests or Kruskal-Wallis test were used to study the association between HCV transmission-related variables and the established genotypes. In conclusion, exposure to multiple risk factors associated with HCV transmission was common among HIV co-infected patients and an association between HCV genotype 3 and intravenous drug user was observed."
1245,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a major problem worldwide, is usually transmitted parenterally or by use of contaminated needles among intravenous-drug users (IVDU). In a cross-sectional study, demographic data were collected and behaviour patterns investigated in interviews with 453, consenting IVDU. Blood samples were collected from each interviewee and checked for anti-HCV antibodies and, in a PCR-based assay, for the RNA of HCV. Almost all (92.5%) of the IVDU investigated were found positive for anti-HCV and/or the viral RNA. Most (73.5%) of those positive for HCV RNA were found to be infected with genotype 3a alone, the rest being infected with 1b (17.9%), 6a (3.5%), 3b (1.4%), 1a (1.0%), or both 3a and 6a (2.1%) or having non-typable infections (0.6%). Curiously, 26.0% of those who appeared seronegative for anti-HCV were positive for HCV RNA. The longer an interviewee had been using intravenous drugs, the more likely he or she was to be infected with HCV. Among the IVDU, the sharing of needles, syringes and/or other drug-related paraphernalia appeared to be the behaviour carrying the highest risk of HCV infection, giving an adjusted odds ratio and (95% confidence interval) of 4.84 (1.88-12.43). Programmes of needle and syringe exchange should probably be implemented among IVDU in Thailand and elsewhere, to slow the transmission of HCV."
9454,0.005,1.0000,"Interactions between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) have been widely studied before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART). We reviewed the potential impact of HAART on hepatitis C as well as the interactions between HIV and HCV therapies. Physicians should be aware of the potential risk of: (i) symptomatic liver disease in HCV-HIV-coinfected patients at the era of triple antiretroviral therapy; (ii) potential liver deterioration paralleling immune restoration; (iii) lack of impact of triple antiretroviral therapy on HCV load; and (iv) potential drug-related hepatitis which may modify the natural history of HCV-related liver disease. Liver biopsies should be performed regularly in these patients in order to identify patients with severe liver disease who require early initiation of anti-HCV therapy under close monitoring of their immune status. Treatment is, to date, based on the combination of ribavirin and interferon with an expected sustained response rate around 25%. An important unresolved issue is to better delineate the temporal place of anti-HCV and anti-HIV antiviral therapies. At least in coinfected patients with significant liver disease, namely necro-inflammatory activity and/or fibrosis >or= 2, we believe that anti-HCV therapy is the priority since it lessens the risk of drug-induced hepatitis and of hepatitis due to immune restoration."

Unlike other herpesviruses, HHV-6 was found with higher frequency and in higher copy numbers of HIV-infected men with high rather than low CD4 cell counts. Among subjects with > 400 CD4 cells/mL, 100% had detectable HHV-6 genomes in PBMC compared with 57.9% of subjects with < 400 CD4 cells/mL (P < .05).

404,0.005,1.0000,"A quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay with single-copy sensitivity targeting HIV-1 gag RNA (the gag single-copy assay [gSCA]) has been used widely to quantify plasma viremia below the limit of detection of clinical assays in patients on effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), but viral RNA in 15 to 30% of samples amplifies inefficiently because of primer/probe mismatches. We sought to develop improved single-copy assays with increased sensitivity by improving nucleic acid recovery, designing qRT-PCR primers and a probe for a highly conserved region of integrase in the HIV-1 pol gene (the integrase single-copy assay [iSCA]), and increasing the plasma volume tested (Mega-iSCA). We evaluated gSCA versus iSCA in paired plasma samples from 10 consecutive patients with viremia of >1,000 copies/ml and 25 consecutive patients on suppressive ART. Three of 10 viremic samples amplified inefficiently with gSCA compared to the Roche Cobas Ampliprep/TaqMan 2.0, whereas all 10 samples amplified efficiently with iSCA. Among 25 samples from patients on suppressive ART, 8 of 12 samples that were negative for HIV-1 RNA by gSCA had detectable HIV-1 RNA by iSCA, and iSCA detected 3-fold or higher HIV-1 RNA levels compared to gSCA in 10 of 25 samples. Large-volume plasma samples (>20 ml) from 7 patients were assayed using Mega-iSCA, and HIV-1 RNA was quantifiable in 6, including 4 of 5 that were negative by standard-volume iSCA. These improved assays with superior sensitivity will be useful for evaluating whether in vivo interventions can reduce plasma viremia and for assessing relationships between residual viremia and other virologic parameters, including the inducible proviral reservoir.

A high prevalence of occult HBV has been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from Asia, but little information is available on the prevalence of occult HBV in HCC from regions with a low prevalence of typical chronic hepatitis B infection. In a retrospective study, 19 cases of primary liver cancer were investigated for the presence of occult HBV DNA by amplification of the surface, core, and X gene. In addition, HBV copy numbers were quantitated by real time polymerase chain reaction, genotyped, and samples tested for covalently closed circular HBV DNA, which is a marker of active viral replication. Occult HBV was found in three of 19 cases (16%). Genotyping was successful in two cases, both of which were genotype A. HBV DNA copy numbers were low, all less than 10 copies/microg liver DNA. No closed circular HBV DNA was detected. Thus, in this study occult HBV was of genotype A and was found in a low percentage of cases of HCC and was associated with low tissue HBV DNA copy numbers and no detectable evidence for viral replication."
3495,0.005,1.0000,"AIDS, caused by the retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the leading cause of death of economically active people (age, 15-59 years) in sub-Saharan Africa. The host genetic variability of immune response to HIV and immune reconstitution following initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is poorly understood. Here we focused on copy number variation of the β-defensin genes, which have been shown to have anti-HIV activity, and are important chemoattractants for Th17 lymphocytes via the chemokine receptor CCR6. We determined β-defensin gene copy number for 1002 Ethiopian and Tanzanian patients. We show that higher β-defensin copy number variation is associated with increased HIV load prior to HAART (P=.005) and poor immune reconstitution following initiation of HAART (P=.003). We suggest a model where variable amounts of β-defensin expression by mucosal cells, due to gene copy number variation, alters the efficacy of recruitment of Th17 lymphocytes to the site of infection, altering the dynamics of infection."

By Mann-Whitney U test, significantly higher (P < .05, two-tailed) copy numbers of CMV DNA were detected in HIV-seropositive patients with retinitis than in either patients with < 100 CD4 cells/mm3 and no symptomatic CMV disease or HIV-seropositive patients with > 100 CD4 cells/mm3. By prospective monitoring for increases in CMV DNA copy number, it may be possible to identify HIV-seropositive patients who are at imminent risk for development of symptomatic CMV retinitis."
10083,0.005,1.0000,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 69 individuals using a real-time NASBA quantitative assay. Patients with HIV infection harbored significantly lower mtDNA copy number in PBMC than HIV-negative controls. Besides, subjects on stavudine-containing regimens showed significantly lower median mtDNA amounts than HIV-positive patients receiving other antiretroviral drugs, and this was associated with higher lactate levels. Thus, either HIV infection itself or treatment with stavudine-containing regimens might induce mtDNA depletion and related metabolic disturbances as hyperlactatemia."
2628,0.005,1.0000,"Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) represent an extrahepatic hepatitis C virus (HCV) reservoir, the significance of which is unclear due to limited studies and varying test methodologies. In this study, a commercial viral load assay for measuring cell-associated PBMC HCV RNA was evaluated. HCV RNA was extracted from PBMCs, sorted CD14+, and CD19+ cells and corresponding plasma samples using the Abbott m2000 and Real-Time HCV assay. Test performance and influence of HIV seropositivity on plasma and PBMC HCV RNA were studied. Among 51 patients, 67 and 62 unique patient samples had detectable plasma and PBMC HCV viral load, respectively. The median PBMC viral load was 535 IU/1 M cells (range 29-5,190). CD19+ cells had significantly higher viral load than CD14+ cells (median log(10) HCV viral load 2.63 vs. 1.50 IU/ml; P< 0.001). Stability of PBMC viral load over time was demonstrated in untreated patients; all patients with an undetectable plasma HCV viral load after HCV treatment also demonstrated undetectable PBMC viral load. Repeated testing in nine samples yielded consistent PBMC viral load, differing by only 1.3-fold (range 1.0-1.7-fold). Among samples with detectable plasma HCV RNA, the correlation between PBMC and plasma viral load was moderate (r = 0.66) and was greater among HCV mono-infected compared to HIV/HCV co-infected subjects (r = 0.80 vs. 0.52). Measurement of cell-associated PBMC HCV RNA using a commercial assay demonstrated promising test characteristics. Differences in PBMC HCV viral load based on HIV-coinfection status and the significance of greater copy number in B-cells requires further study."
16209,0.005,1.0000,"The use of high activity antiretroviral therapies (HAART) to treat HIV-infected patients frequently results in the long-term suppression of plasma virus RNA loads below levels detectable by current assays. The measurement of provirus DNA load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells provides a means of continuing to monitor the efficacy of treatment and the decline in reservoirs of latent virus. A quantitative PCR assay was developed for HIV-1 provirus using a three-point internal calibrator system to give high reproducibility and accuracy at the low copy numbers of provirus seen in clinical samples. Provirus DNA copies are related to cell number in the samples using a fluorescent dye-binding assay for measurement of input DNA. The assay agreed closely with an end-point dilution PCR and gave accurate quantification of extracts from an HIV-1 infected continuous cell line containing known provirus copy numbers. The inclusion of a second primer set in the LTR region of the HIV-1 genome, optimised to non-clade-B virus strains improved the detection and quantification of samples from patients infected with genetically divergent virus strains. Application of the assay to clinical trial patients showed no relationship between changes in provirus DNA loads and plasma virus RNA and changes in provirus load over 24 weeks were small."

Increased rates of atherosclerotic disease and diabetes have been associated with lipodystrophy and now from one of the major causes of morbidity in HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).This review, based on a multi-database keyword search, summarises the lipid changes observed in the course of HIV infection and its treatment, and puts them into the context of other risk factors for cardiac disease, and other causes of cardiovascular disease in HIV."

Hyperhomocysteinemia, which is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease and thromboembolism, may develop in HCV-infected patients although altered alanine amino transferase (ALT) enzyme levels are generally associated with damage to liver cells. The gold standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C patients is pegylated interferon combined with an anti-viral drug (ribavirin).

11989,0.005,1.0000,"According to the Institute of Medicine, the risk of clinically significant vitamin D deficiency increases at 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL. By this standard, most cirrhotic hepatitis C virus- (HCV-) positive patients and many noncirrhotic patients are vitamin D-deficient. The high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among HCV patients is a cause for concern for several specific reasons. Classic studies established the importance of vitamin D and calcium in maintaining bone. Vitamin D's beneficial effects on bone are likely to be vital for HCV-infected patients because these individuals have a high prevalence of low bone mineral density. Many pharmaceutical agents reduce bone density and exposure to these drugs may increase bone disease in HCV-positive patients. Bone loss occurs following liver transplantation and bone density is often low in patients with HIV/HCV co-infection who are on combination antiretroviral therapy. Some evidence suggests that ribavirin reduces bone density, underscoring the special need to monitor vitamin D in patients receiving HCV treatment and to prescribe supplements, as appropriate. In addition to its role in calcium metabolism, vitamin D is also an immune modulator that reduces inflammation while enhancing protective immune responses. Higher vitamin D levels are associated with less liver fibrosis and less inflammation in HCV patients. Recent studies show that low vitamin D levels are associated with treatment failure among HCV-infected patients receiving pegylated-interferon and ribavirin. If confirmed, these findings will provide an additional reason to ensure adequate levels of vitamin D. Information about how to monitor vitamin D status and how to use vitamin D supplements most effectively in HCV-infected patients is provided."
3496,0.005,1.0000,"Cardiovascular disease has been frequent in HIV-infected patients both before and after the advent of antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The pathogenic basis for the increase of cardiovascular disease, in particular myocardial lesions, may involve HIV-1 itself or other mechanisms including endothelial dysfunction, activation of proinflammatory cytokines, and changes in platelets, which lead to atherosclerotic lesions of blood vessels. In the last decade, among the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin 18 seems to play a central role in the inflammatory cascade, leading to development of atherosclerotic disease and the occurrence of ischemic heart disease in uninfected HIV-1 people. Increased levels of interleukin 18 were observed in HIV-1 infected patients. This review attempts to evaluate the role of interleukin 18 in cardiovascular disease, especially in myocardial infarction, in HIV-1 infection, as well as the relationship between interleukin 18 and atherosclerotic plaque formation. Two other characteristic aspects in HIV-1 infection, metabolic syndrome and lipodystrophy, will be evaluated in light of activity of interleukin 18. Moreover, the role of platelets and interleukin 18 as an important linkage between chronic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and atherogenesis will be highlighted. Finally, experimental an animal model of rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus clearly demonstrates the involvement of interleukin 18 in myocardial lesions, and that circulating levels of interleukin 18 are important predictors of coronary heart disease. In conclusion, interleukin 18 may be considered a partner in crime with other factors, including endothelial dysfunction, increased expression and production of adhesion molecules and proinflammatory cytokines in determining cardiovascular disease."
19280,0.005,1.0000,"HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients have a 3-fold increased fracture incidence compared to uninfected patients. The impact of HCV therapy on bone health is unclear. We evaluated bone turnover markers (BTM) in well-controlled (HIV RNA <50 copies/ml) HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who received pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) in ACTG trial A5178. Early virologic responders (EVR: ≥2 log HCV RNA drop at week 12) continued PEG-IFN/RBV and non-EVRs were randomized to continuation of PEG-IFN alone or observation. We assessed changes in C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX; bone resorption marker) and procollagen type I intact N-terminal propeptide (P1NP; bone formation marker), and whether BTM changes were associated with EVR, complete early virologic response (cEVR: HCV RNA <600 IU/ml at week 12), or PEG-IFN treatment. A total of 192 subjects were included. After 12 weeks of PEG-IFN/RBV, CTX and P1NP decreased: -120 pg/ml and -8.48 μg/liter, respectively (both p < 0.0001). CTX declines were greater in cEVR (N = 91; vs. non-cEVR (N = 101; p = 0.003). From week 12 to 24, CTX declines were sustained among EVR patients who continued PEG-IFN/RBV (p = 0.027 vs. non-EVR) and among non-EVR patients who continued PEG-IFN alone (p = 0.022 vs. Observation). Median decreases of P1NP in EVR vs. non-EVR were similar at weeks 12 and 24. PEG-IFN-based therapy for chronic HCV markedly reduces bone turnover. It is unclear whether this is a direct IFN effect or a result of HCV viral clearance, or whether they will result in improved bone mineral density. Further studies with IFN-free regimens should explore these questions."
7971,0.005,1.0000,"In the United States, approximately 30% of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients are also infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Both viruses share similar routes of transmission. Unlike HIV or hepatitis B virus, HCV is curable if treated and the patient achieves a sustained virologic response. The impact of coinfection includes greater morbidity and mortality, with higher rates of opportunistic disease, development of cirrhosis, and death. The standard of treatment for HIV-HCV coinfection is similar to that for HCV monoinfection and consists of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin. As with HCV monoinfection, the best predictor of response to therapy for HIV-HCV coinfection is infection with an HCV genotype other than genotype 1 or 4. Adherence to treatment is critical for improving response to HCV therapy. However, considerable toxicities are associated with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin and pose particular problems in the coinfected patient. Coinfected patients are more likely to experience significant weight loss with HCV therapy. Neutropenia and anemia are both common laboratory abnormalities that necessitate dosage reductions and are concerns for development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining events. The effect of CD4(+) cell count has been evaluated both as a factor in response to HCV therapy and in stratification of risk for infection. Immunosuppression is not a contraindication to HCV therapy, although CD4(+) counts above 350 cells/mm(3) are associated with increased response rates in patients with HCV genotype 1 coinfection. Antiretroviral therapy does need to be adjusted to minimize adverse effects. Concomitant use of zidovudine is contraindicated because of its profound exacerbation of bone marrow suppression. The use of didanosine is also not indicated during HCV therapy because of the risks of hepatic decompensation. Controversy exists regarding the use of abacavir. Newer agents for HCV include the protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir. Although results with the protease inhibitors are highly encouraging, their effects in coinfected patients have not been evaluated. Treatment for HCV in patients with HIV poses potential obstacles to success, but the benefits of viral eradication warrant the challenge of therapy."
9219,0.005,1.0000,"The role of virus-specific T cells in hepatitis C virus (HCV) pathogenesis is not clear. Existing knowledge on the frequency, phenotype, and behavior of these cells comes from analyses of blood and liver, but other lymphoid compartments that may be important sites for functionally mature T cells have not yet been analyzed. We studied HCV-specific T cells from bone marrow, in comparison to those from peripheral blood and liver biopsy tissue, from 20 persistently HCV-infected patients with benign hematological disorders. Bone marrow contained a sizeable pool of CD8(+) T cells specific for epitopes from structural and nonstructural HCV proteins. These cells displayed the same effector memory phenotype as liver-derived equivalents and the same proliferative potential as blood-derived equivalents but had greater antiviral effector functions such as Ag-specific cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production. These features were not shared by influenza virus-specific CD8(+) T cells in the same bone marrow samples. Despite their highly differentiated phenotype and activated status, some bone marrow-resident HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells were not directed against the infecting virus but, instead, against historical HCV Ags (i.e., viral species of a previous infection or minor viral species of the current infection). These findings provide a snapshot view of the distribution, differentiation, and functioning of virus-specific memory T cells in patients with persistent HCV infection."

Although education, behavior modification, and promotion of condom use are effective transmission-prevention measures, the severity of the pandemic demands that all possible prevention strategies be explored. Antiretroviral therapy has the potential to decrease sexual transmission of HIV type 1 by reducing levels of HIV RNA and thus decreasing the risk that infected persons will transmit the disease or by its use as preexposure or postexposure prophylaxis. In this article, we explore the rationale for using antiretroviral therapy to prevent sexual transmission of HIV, as well as the limitations of this approach."
4896,0.005,1.0000,"Worldwide, about 85% of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections were acquired through sexual transmission. Control strategies have been focused on behavioral change through educational efforts and condom promotion, which had achieved certain success in several countries. The past decade witnessed the extraordinary advances in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and its effectiveness. HAART fundamentally alters the course of HIV-1 infection by decreasing the plasma viral load to the undetectable level and increasing the number of CD4 + T cells. However, problems including drug resistance and adverse events also exist in HAART. In the near future, the major challenges may include: determining the role and efficacy of new drugs and new therapies; addressing the coinfection of HIV/liver diseases/tuberculosis; improving the savage management; addressing the issues faced by the resource-limited countries; and achieving further success in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment."

To monitor HIV prevalence and behaviors associated with HIV risk and prevention among persons who inject drugs (PWID), CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) system conducts interviews and HIV testing in selected cities. This report summarizes HIV prevalence and behaviors among PWID interviewed and tested in 20 cities in 2012. Of the 10,002 PWID tested, 11% had a positive HIV test result. Among 9,425 PWID included in the behavioral analysis, 30% receptively shared syringes, 70% had vaginal sex without a condom, 25% had heterosexual anal sex without a condom, and 5% of males had male-to-male sexual contact without a condom in the previous 12 months. Fifty-one percent of PWID included in the behavioral analysis had been tested for HIV, 25% participated in an HIV behavioral intervention, and 39% participated in substance abuse treatment in the previous 12 months. Additional efforts are needed to reduce risk behaviors and increase access to HIV testing, drug treatment, and other HIV prevention programs to further reduce HIV infections among PWID. "

A cross-sectional study was carried out on 480 HIV-positive sexually active new mothers in 48 primary health care clinics in Nkangala District. Post-natal women were recruited by systematic sampling (every consecutive patient over a period of 2 months) and responded to a questionnaire. Overall, 31.9% reported unsafe sex with an HIV-uninfected of unknown-status partner. In multivariate regression analysis, not having disclosed their HIV status, having experienced physical partner violence, lack of male involvement and not having attended a support group were associated with unsafe sex. Several risk factors for unsafe sex post-natally have been identified and can be utilised in post-partum sexual health education programmes. "

Data from 1,938 young sexually active women who lived in five U.S. cities where the risk for human immunodeficiency virus is high were analyzed by using logistic, ordinal, and multiple linear regression analysis. For the pros scale of condom use, 27% of the women had low scores, and 33% had moderate scores. For the cons scale, 27% had moderate scores, and 5% had high scores. Of the total, 47% had a negative score on the decisional balance measure. Older age, living with a spouse or partner, or binge drinking was associated with lower pros scores and with a negative score on the decisional balance measure. Income from public assistance was associated with higher pros scores. Income from a spouse or partner or a history of sexually transmitted disease was associated with lower pros scores. Multiple sex partners or being at risk for HIV infection (based on perceptions of the main partner's behaviors) was associated with higher cons scores. Income from a job was associated with a positive score on the decisional balance measure. Our analysis identified the characteristics of women who have low pros scores, high cons scores, and negative decisional balance scores. The regression results can inform our work in HIV prevention on whether to focus on the pros, the cons, or both to obtain positive decisional balance scores and increase condom use in situations that warrant protective behaviors."
6432,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the relationship between viral factors and the development of chronic hepatitis B, the entire hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome of chronic carriers at different disease stages were analyzed. Eighty genotype C HBV carriers including 12 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive asymptomatic carriers (Group A), 49 HBeAg positive patients with chronic liver diseases (Group B) and 19 anti-HBe positive patients with chronic liver diseases (Group C) were studied. HBV nucleic acid from serum samples was sequenced directly and compared with GenBank reference sequences HBV X01587 and M12906. On phylogenetic analysis, 76 cases were genotype C2. Of the 76 genotype C2 cases, the nucleotide and amino acid substitution rates in the precore/core region were significantly higher in Groups B and C than in Group A, also in Group C than in Group B. The nucleotide substitution rates in the full genome and the core promoter region were significantly higher in Group C than in Group A, also in group C than in Group B. The nucleotide and amino acid substitution rates in the X region were significantly higher in Group C than in Group A. The amino acid substitution rate in the pre-S2 region was significantly higher in Group C than in Group B. Deletion mutations were found mainly in Groups B and C. This whole genome analysis of HBV chronic carriers suggested that the nucleotide substitutions and deletions in HBV were closely associated with the pathogenesis of chronic HBV infection."
169,0.005,1.0000,"Direct infection of glia by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been suggested as one of several mechanisms responsible for the severe neurologic complications observed in both neonates and adults with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We have demonstrated by protein immunoblotting analysis that HIV-1 infection of human fetal glial cells isolated from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of the developing human peripheral nervous system results in viral gag antigen expression with little, if any, detectable env gene products. No cytopathogenicity was evident in the infected cell population. Blot hybridization analyses indicate transient expression of the HIV-1 genome with maximum levels of virus-specific RNA being observed between 2 and 3 days postinfection and decreasing below the limits of detection by 16 days postinfection. To determine whether infection of the human fetal DRG glial cell population culminates in the production and release of infectious HIV-1, cocultivation and reverse transcriptase assays were performed. Direct assay of HIV-1-infected neural cell supernatants as well as exposure of permissive SupT1 cells to these HIV-1-infected neural cell supernatants resulted in no demonstrable reverse transcriptase activity in either the HIV-1-infected DRG glial cell supernatants or the SupT1 cell supernatants. Although transmission electron microscopy analyses have suggested the absence of intracellular viral particles, highly electron-dense inclusions in the cytoplasm of HIV-1-infected DRG glial cells were observed. The nature of the intracellular cytoplasmic inclusions is under current investigation. Cumulatively, these data suggest that the interaction of HIV-1 with human fetal DRG neural cells results in transient expression of the HIV genome culminating in a nonproductive infection."

HCV RNA was found in sera from 27 of these 28 anti-HCV-positive patients. However, 8 dialysis patients had detectable levels of HCV RNA but were anti-HCV-negative with second-generation ELISAs. Among the 35 HCV-infected dialysis patients 16 were positive, 7 indeterminate, and 12 negative with the second-generation RIBA. More than 60% of patients with evidence of ongoing liver disease had HCV infection. Thus, current commercially available antibody tests did not accurately reflect the HCV status in dialysis patients. A relatively high prevalence (> 10%) of HCV RNA, closely associated with liver disease, was found among dialysis patients in a low-prevalence area of the world."

Serum samples were tested for HCV antibodies by a second-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and for HCV RNA using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and retested for anti-HCV and HCV RNA three months later. 24 (30%) of 80 hemodialysis patients were anti-HCV positive, and 2 (3.6%) of 56 anti-HCV negative cases were found HCV RNA positive. By combined assessment, the HCV infection rate of hemodialysis patient was 32.5% (26/80). Mantel-Haenszel analysis showed that HCV infection was associated with multi-transfusions, dialysis over a long period, renal transplantation, history of operation. Samples of dialysate in 9 serum HCV RNA positive cases were directly detected for HCV RNA, and 3 were found HCV RNA detectable. HCV infection rate in hemodialysis patients is higher than that of general population. The main risk factors for HCV transmission is transfusion of unscreened blood but is not an independent factor, hemodialysis itself plays an important role, the length of time on dialysis, renal transplantation, blood-contaminated material and contaminated dialysis equipment are also the risk factors. Infected hemodialysis patients should be isolated."
4241,0.005,1.0000,"A nationwide prospective survey on hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections among dialysis patients in The Netherlands was performed. Patients were recruited from 34 dialysis centers and were tested for antibodies and HCV RNA in 1995 and 1997. Seronegative serum samples were analyzed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in pools. HCV-RNA-positive serum samples were genotyped and were partly sequenced. In the first and second rounds, 67 (2.9%) of 2281 and 76 (3.4%) of 2286 patients were HCV positive, respectively. Of 960 patients with paired serum samples, 35 were HCV positive in both rounds, and 9 HCV-positive cases were newly identified in the second round. The incidence of HCV infection was 0.5 per 100 dialysis years. Phylogenetic analysis revealed clustered sequences that indicated nosocomial transmission. Sixty percent of HCV infections, however, can be attributed to 4 interdependent risk factors (i.e., hemodialysis before 1992, kidney transplantation before 1994, and birth or dialysis in a foreign country). In conclusion, the prevalence of HCV infections in The Netherlands does not decline, and transmission within dialysis units continues. Adequate screening of HCV infections and strict enforcement of universal infection control practices are required."
16203,0.005,1.0000,"Viral hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are important causes of mortality and morbidity in patients treated by haemodialysis (HD). Both are further promoted by the characteristic immunological dysfunction that develops in renal failure and interferes with the patient's ability to eliminate these viruses. The hepatotropic viruses A through G remain the causative agents in 60 to 80% of hepatitis. But, as far as HD is concerned, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the two most important organisms responsible for almost all the patients' morbidity. In HD, both patients as well as staff are at a high risk of acquiring hepatitis B infection. The prevalence of HBV in the dialysis population in India is reported to range between 3.4% and 42%. The acute course of the infection is often anicteric and peak transaminase concentration is significantly less than in patients with normal renal function. Up to 60% of dialysis patients with HBV infection develop chronic hepatitis with persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and infectivity. The risk of transmission of HBV infection due to blood from one patient to another is mostly because of inadequate precautions taken by the dialysis staff. Combined therapy with interferon (6-10 million units) three times a week and lamivudine (100-300 mg/day) would be more effective in controlling viral replication. The most important modality for prevention of HBV infection is induction of immunity by hepatitis B vaccination. Administration of 40 microg doses at months 0, 1, 2 and 6 is the most rapid immunogenic schedule. The prevalence of HCV in HD patients ranges from 6% in the United Kingdom to 60% in Poland and Eastern Europe, 8-36% in North America. HD patients in different parts of India exhibit high anti-HCV positivity (12.1%, 45.2%, 33.3% and 41.9%) in various studies. The incidence and prevalence of HCV infection among patients on dialysis in developed countries are steadily declining because of (i) reduction in post-transfusion HCV infection, (ii) infection control measures to prevent nosocomial infection. Among HD patients with HCV infection, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) levels are elevated in only 4 to 67% patients who are positive for anti-HCV, in only 12 to 31% patients with HCV RNA and only in one-third of those with biopsy proven hepatitis. Number of blood transfusion, duration of HD treatment, and mode of dialysis are important risk factors. Patient to patient transmission of HCV occurs in HD units by needle stick injury, breakdown in standard infection control practices, physical proximity to an infected patient, dialysis machines, dialysis membranes and HD ultrafiltrate and reprocessing of dialyser. The prevalence of HIV infection in dialysis populations varies according to different countries and geographic areas, 0% and 13% in 1990 and 1995 respectively. There was no evidence of transmission within the centre transmission, from patient to patient or patient to staff. Antiretroviral therapy is the corner-stone of the HIV infection in end stage renal disease (ESRD). Most commonly, zidovudine (AZT) has been used in these patients. Currently recommended dose of 200 mg three times a day is probably safe in these patients."

They were followed for 19 months after cessation of therapy. Sustained serum HCV RNA clearance occurred in 42% of patients treated for 6 months and in 64% of those treated for 12 months. HCV was eradicated from 6 of 13 patients infected with HCV genotype 1b and from 2 of 6 patients also infected with hepatitis G virus. HCV RNA remained undetectable in both serum and a liver biopsy of 2 patients who were given cadaveric kidney transplants after IFN-alpha treatment. These data suggest that HCV RNA-positive dialysis patients can be considered for treatment while receiving dialysis, particularly those awaiting transplant."

19279,0.005,1.0000,"The efficiency of hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission by sexual activity remains controversial. We conducted a cross-sectional study of HCV-positive subjects and their partners to estimate the risk for HCV infection among monogamous heterosexual couples. A total of 500 anti-HCV-positive, human immunodeficiency virus-negative index subjects and their long-term heterosexual partners were studied. Couples were interviewed separately for lifetime risk factors for HCV infection, within-couple sexual practices, and sharing of personal grooming items. Blood samples were tested for anti-HCV, HCV RNA, and HCV genotype and serotype. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis determined the relatedness of virus isolates among genotype-concordant couples. The majority of HCV-positive index subjects were non-Hispanic white, with a median age of 49 years (range, 26-79 years) and median of 15 years (range, 2-52 years) of sexual activity with their partners. Overall, HCV prevalence among partners was 4% (n=20), and nine couples had concordant genotype/serotype. Viral isolates in three couples (0.6%) were highly related, consistent with transmission of virus within the couple. Based on 8,377 person-years of follow-up, the maximum incidence rate of HCV transmission by sex was 0.07% per year (95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.13) or approximately one per 190,000 sexual contacts. No specific sexual practices were related to HCV positivity among couples."
17448,0.005,1.0000,"The aim was to determine the prevalence of HIV infection and risk factors for HIV infection in various population subgroups in Ethiopia. Serum panels from blood donors (n = 2610), from various population subgroups in Ethiopia were tested for anti-HIV-1/2 by ELISA. All ELISA repeatedly reactive samples were subjected for confirmation by immunoblot (IB) and anti-HIV-1 and anti-HIV-2 specific ELISAs. 155/2610 (5.9%) blood donors were HIV-1 infected. Of pregnant women, 84/797 (10.5%) were HIV-1 infected, and 1/797 (0.1%) was HIV-2 infected. 1/240 (0.4%) individuals from the rural population were HIV-1 infected. 198/480 (41.3%) female attendees, and 106/419 (25.3%) male attendees at sexual transmitted disease (STD) clinics were HIV-1 infected. One (0.2%) male, and 2 (0.4%) female STD patients were infected with both HIV-1 and HIV-2. It was concluded that the prevalence of HIV-1 infection varied from 0.4% among urban residents to 25.3-41.3% among STD attendees. There is a low prevalence of HIV-2 present in Ethiopian subjects. Risky sexual behaviour is significantly associated with HIV-infection in Ethiopia."
7506,0.005,1.0000,"Although HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection has been recognized worldwide in individuals exposed to blood-borne and sexually transmitted diseases (STD), limited data are available on the epidemiology of this coinfection in Brazil. A cross-sectional study was carried out to estimate the prevalence of HCV seropositivity in a cohort of people living with HIV/AIDS in Santos, Brazil, and to investigate potential risk factors for HCV infection. Anti-HCV antibodies were sought by using two immunoenzymatic assays. Overall HCV seroprevalence was 36.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31.9-40.4%). However, it was significantly higher (84.8%, 95% CI 78.2-91.3%) among intravenous drug users (IDU) as compared to non-IDU (20.9%, 95% CI 16.8-25.1%) (p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that HCV seropositivity among IDU was independently associated with needle sharing (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] = 4.28, p = 0.07) and with serologic evidence of exposure to other bloodborne agents: HBV (adjOR = 4.39, p = 0.01) and HTLV-I/II (adjOR = 6.43, p = 0.02). In contrast, no association with lifetime number of sexual partners, history of STD, or of sex with commercial sex workers (CSW) could be demonstrated. Among non-IDU, HCV seropositivity was independently associated with sexual partnership with IDU (adjOR = 2.15, p = 0.08) and with HBV seropositivity (adjOR = 1.71, p = 0.05), but not with engaging in oral or anal receptive intercourse or having sex with CSW. Results indicate that exposure to blood and sexual partnership with IDU constitute the main risk factors for HCV acquisition among HIV-positive patients in Santos, Brazil. Prevention of HCV spread in this population should thus include harm reduction measures and information on safer sex practices for both IDU and their sexual partners."
15146,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this descriptive correlational study was to (1) examine differences in baccalaureate nursing students' attitudes toward persons living with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (PLWAs) according to mode of transmission and (2) identify demographic and academic variables influencing baccalaureate nursing students' attitudes toward PLWAs. Two hundred forty-six students from five geographically dispersed baccalaureate programs returned a completed demographic data sheet, AIDS Knowledge Scale, and AIDS Attitude Scale. The AIDS Attitude Scale, based on Goffman's theory of stigma, assesses stigmatizing attitudes, perceptions of deservedness of care, and attitudes of respect and regard for PLWAs according to five modes of human immunodeficiency virus transmission. The findings of this study demonstrated overall that baccalaureate students were the most stigmatizing toward persons who had developed AIDS through injecting drugs followed by sexual contact (both homosexual and heterosexual) and least stigmatizing toward PLWAs who contracted the virus through maternal transmission or a blood transfusion. Perhaps the PLWA who contracted AIDS through either maternal transmission or a blood transfusion was viewed as an ""innocent victim"" of the disease, whereas PLWAs who contracted the virus through either shared needles or sexual transmission were viewed as having acquired the infection through the results of their actions. The demographic characteristics of the respondents did not influence AIDS attitudes."

The study was carried out in the period May 2006-June 2010 and recruited a total of 393 patients (59.8% males-median age of 32.6 years). All patients were tested for serological markers of HBV, HCV, and HIV infection. One-hundred thirty-eight (35.1%) individuals did not show any HBV/HCV/HIV serological marker, while 186 (47.3%) were indicative of past or current HBV infection. A total of 42 (10.7%) subjects were HBsAg positive, 59 (15.0%) showed the serological profile ""anti-HBc alone"", and only 40 (10.1%) were anti-HBs alone. Overall, 22/393 (5.6%) immigrants were anti-HCV positive and 13/327 (4.0%) were infected with HIV. Findings from this study suggest that a suitable screening protocol for the viral blood/sexually transmissible diseases is recommended on entering Italy, and the adoption of health control strategies should also be considered to safeguard the health of the local population."

1596,0.005,1.0000,"We tested whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) could be differentiated from HIV-2 by a reverse transcriptase (RT)-typing assay that measured the reduction of enzyme activity owing to specific antibody. RT-inhibiting antibody was examined for HIV type specificity by a new nonradioisotopic RT assay. Antibodies from four rabbits immunized with recombinant HIV-1 RT and from 23 HIV-1-seropositive individuals all specifically inhibited the enzyme activities of two HIV-1 strains (LAV-1 and GH-3), three zidovudine-resistant HIV-1 mutants, and a recombinant HIV-1 RT. However, none of these antisera affected the activities of six HIV-2 strains (GH-1, GH-2, GH-4, GH-5, GH-6, LAV-2ROD), Rous-associated virus type 2, and DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli. In contrast, HIV-2 antibody from a rabbit immunized with disrupted GH-1 virions blocked the enzyme activities of the six HIV-2 strains but not those of the three HIV-1 strains, Rous-associated virus type 2, or DNA polymerase I. These results indicate that the antigenic domains of HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs recognized by their inhibiting antibodies are distinct from each other and are highly conserved. Clinical HIV isolates from 18 HIV-1-seropositive individuals and 3 HIV-2-seropositive Ghanaian individuals were identified as HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively, by the nonradioisotopic RT-typing assay."
16551,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has seven genotypes, A to G. Previous studies have shown that genotype C is the most prevalent strain in chronic HBV carriers in East Asia. This study was undertaken to investigate the epidemiology of HBV genotypes among Japanese patients who are coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The sequences of the complete hepatitis B surface antifen (HBsAg) genes were obtained from 18 coinfected Japanese patients. Among the 18 patients, 12 of 13 men who had sex with men (MSM) had genotype A (92%), whereas only one of five heterosexual or hemophiliac patients had genotype A. The predominance of genotype A HBV in MSM showed a striking contrast to the current genotype prevalence in the Japanese population. Owing to the recent decrease in the rate of vertical transmission in Japan, the role of sexual behavior in the transmission of HBV cannot be overestimated. Thus, the relative proportion of genotype A may gradually increase in Japan."
146,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-2 differs from HIV-1 in its relative lower transmissibility and pathogenicity. To understand the virologic basis of these differences, the nef gene from HIV-2-seropositive persons was analyzed because of its importance for disease progression in the genetically related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV[MAC]). Proviral nef sequences from 60 HIV-2-infected persons were amplified from peripheral blood lymphocytes, and nef open-reading frames were screened by a transcription and translation assay for the presence of full-length (32- to 36-kDa) or truncated (<32 kDa) Nef proteins. Overall, 6 (10%) of 60 persons had truncated Nef proteins; of these, 5 were among the 36 asymptomatic subjects (13.9%) and only 1 was among the 24 symptomatic subjects (4.2%) (P =.23). The results of this study document the presence of defective nef genes in HIV-2 infections with a prevalence higher than that previously seen in HIV-1-infected cohorts of long-term nonprogressors or patients with AIDS."
13610,0.005,1.0000,"Owing to antiretroviral drug-induced endothelial dysfunction, HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) may have elevated blood pressure. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effects of ART on blood pressure levels and hypertension risk among HIV-infected populations worldwide. We sought articles that compared the mean blood pressure measurements and hypertension prevalence between HIV-infected adults naive and exposed to ART. Thirty-nine studies comprising 44 903 participants met the inclusion criteria. Overall, systolic (mean difference (MD) 4.52 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.65-6.39, I(2)=68.1%, 19 studies) and diastolic blood pressure levels (MD 3.17 mm Hg, 95% CI 1.71-4.64, I(2)=72.5%, 16 studies) were significantly higher among ART-exposed patients compared with treatment-naive patients. Similarly, the risk of hypertension was significantly higher among ART-exposed patients, such that among 28 908 ART-exposed patients, 4195 (14.5%) had hypertension compared with 950 of 9086 (10.5%) in those who were treatment-naive (odds ratio 1.68, 95% CI 1.35-2.10, I(2)=81.5%, 32 studies). In summary, exposure to ART is significantly associated with increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, and increased risk of hypertension, regardless of study-level sociodemographic differences. This meta-analysis supports the need for population-based strategies to reduce the risk of high blood pressure among people living with HIV on ART."
19164,0.005,1.0000,"A prospective study was designed to determine the risk of hepatitis B transmission from health care deliverers to patients in the hospital setting. Six chronic carriers of hepatitis B were identified: 2 surgeons, 1 dialysis nurse, 1 pediatric ICU nurse, 1 pharmacist and 1 orderly. Three of the six were HBeAg-positive. Two of the HBeAG-positive chronic carriers also had circulating hepatitis B virus DNA and accounted for approximately two-thirds of the total patient contacts. Two hundred thirteen patients were exposed 450 times to these six hepatitis B carrier staff without evidence of hepatitis B acquisition over a 6-month follow up. One-hundred nineteen control patients, exposed 789 times to noncarrier health care deliverers, were also negative. Another 33 patients were exposed to three additional individuals who were in the prodrome of acute hepatitis B: an intensive care nurse, a dental hygienist and a medical student. These patients showed no evidence of hepatitis B during 6 months of follow-up, nor did 25 separate control patients. Thus, 246 patients were exposed a total of 483 times to nine health care personnel who had either acute or chronic hepatitis B. No evidence of hepatitis B transmission was found. One-hundred forty-four controls revealed similar results after 814 exposures. Based on the number of exposures to chronic carriers alone, the risk of hepatitis B transmission is estimated to be less than 1%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
14240,0.005,1.0000,"Over the past decade the cognitive approach to depression has received considerable attention. The impetus for this stems from empirical and theoretical reports of its efficacy in its application to the treatment of depressed individuals (Beck, 1976, 1976; Seligman, 1975; Abramson et al., 1978). This paper examines the theory and practice of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and questions whether it has anything to offer clinicians working with people affected by acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) given that it was originally developed, and has traditionally been used, to treat mood disordered psychiatric patient populations. The theory of cognitive therapy is examined with specific emphasis on Beck's contribution. Reference is made to the literature on the psychological problems experienced by people with AIDS (PWAs), and an assessment is presented of the contribution of cognitive therapy to ameliorate problems experienced by PWAs."

Considerable research and clinical work has focused on issues surrounding patient compliance to prescribed regimens. Few studies have explored the essence of antiretroviral medications in the lives of women of colour with HIV. A qualitative study of HIV-infected women of colour was undertaken in response to the question: What is the role of antiretroviral medication in your life? Taped interviews were conducted with graduate psychology students and commercially transcribed. Transcriptions were analyzed by Spiegelberg's category-cluster-theme process by four different reviewers. Three themes were distilled: trust/mistrust, approach/avoidance motivation and 'constantly tethered'.

12881,0.005,1.0000,"Alcohol use negatively affects adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), thus human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) care providers need accurate, efficient assessments of alcohol use. Using existing data from an efficacy trial of 2 cognitive-behavioral ART adherence interventions, the authors sought to determine if results on 2 common alcohol screening tests (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test--Consumption [AUDIT-C] and its binge-related question [AUDIT-3]) predict ART nonadherence. Twenty-seven percent of the sample (n = 308) were positive on the AUDIT-C and 34% were positive on the AUDIT-3. In multivariate analyses, AUDIT-C-positive status predicted ART nonadherence after controlling for race, age, conscientiousness, and self-efficacy (P = .036). Although AUDIT-3-positive status was associated with ART nonadherence in unadjusted analyses, this relationship was not maintained in the final multivariate model. The AUDIT-C shows potential as an indirect screening tool for both at-risk drinking and ART nonadherence, underscoring the relationship between alcohol and chronic disease management."
11282,0.005,1.0000,"The introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has substantially modified the natural history of HIV infection. At the beginning of the cART era the objective was focused on HIV-1-associated mortality and morbidity, but as this objective was accomplished other issues emerged, including toxicity, resistance and compliance with treatment. Moreover, the participation of other disease mechanisms, such as proinflammatory activity, in the so-called non-AIDS events is becoming increasingly important. To overcome these issues, therapeutic options have dramatically expanded, which has made the management of HIV-1-infected patients increasingly complex. The intense changes seen raise the question of what will be the future of HIV infection and its treatment. A projection into the future may help to reflect on current limitations, needs and research priorities, to optimize patient care. To debate on this topic a group of 38 experts has initiated The HIV 2020 Project, with the aim of reflecting on the future of HIV infection and identifying the needs that should be the attention of research in different areas. This document summarizes the group's conclusions on the future of antiretroviral treatment, presented as 20 relevant questions. Each question includes the current status of the topic and our vision for the future."
9052,0.005,1.0000,"The adequacy with which nurses address the needs of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) depends upon their ability to recognize such needs. A 61-item Nurse/Patient Summary was completed on all patients by day shift nurses at a tertiary care center. The Nurse/Patient Summary encompasses the physical, functional, psychological, and social needs of patients as perceived by their nurses. Data were collected from 1987 to 1989. Findings indicate that the needs identified by the day shift nurses were congruent on the whole with the nursing literature on persons with HIV disease, although some identified needs were not adequately explored in the literature. This study does not address directly the question as to whether nurses in AIDS units might have identified more needs than their nonspecialty colleagues. Using the literature as a proxy, however, these findings indicate that nonspecialty nurses are able to identify the needs of persons with HIV disease. Thus, specialty units need not be predicated on the basis of a lack of nursing expertise in general units."
5181,0.005,1.0000,"From 1996 to 2002, hepatitis C virus (HCV) typing was prospectively performed for 1,281 unselected HCV-infected and viremic patients, irrespective of their clinical status. Eighty-three patients (6.5%) were coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV. A total of 1,195 strains were identified by a serotype screening (Murex HCV Serotyping 1-6 assay) and/or genotyping (Inno-LiPA HCV II) test. The distribution of HCV types showed an unusually high rate of type 5 (14.2%) that was stable over time and was the third most frequent type, after type 1 (59.1%) and type 3 (15.1%). HCV type 5 was more frequent in patients who were older than 50 (P = 10(-6)), but its frequency did not differ significantly by gender (P = 0.21). Serotyping was performed for 1,160 strains but failed for 30.2% of them. The efficiency depended on HIV status (for HCV-HIV-coinfected patients, half of the strains were untypeable) and HCV type. Genotyping was performed for 428 samples, with an overall efficiency of 99.3%. It failed in three cases, which were subsequently identified as HCV type 2. Serotyping and genotyping results for 39 patients showed discrepancies between the two methods for 4 patients, who had HCV type 2, type 6, or mixed infections. Thus, HCV type 5 may also be encountered frequently in Western countries. Its apparent confinement to a restricted area raises the question of how it emerged and underscores the need for further studies of HCV type prevalence, routes of transmission, pathogenicity, and responses to treatment."
15223,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health concern around the world, and only a minority of patients receiving current treatments achieve a sustained response following a short course of therapy. The majority of patients require prolonged therapy to suppress viral replication. However, several recent reports show that inhibiting host-cell proteins can prevent viral infection. Human epiregulin (EREG) was confirmed by our previous study to be up-regulated in HepG2.2.15 cells while down-regulated by lamivudine. Therefore, the question was asked whether inhibiting EREG could prevent viral infection. To address this question, antisense oligonucleiotides (ASODNs) were used to down-regulate EREG expression in HepG2.2.15 cells. We were able to show that HBV propagation in HepG2.2.15 cell culture was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by EREG inhibition. In addition, we found that treatment with ASODNs did not affect HepG2.2.15 cell viability. To probe the role of EREG in HBV replication, the interaction between EREG and HBsAg was also verified using co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. We observed that EREG can contribute to HBsAg binding to HepG2 cells. In summary, this study demonstrates that EREG is essential for HBV replication and also provides some evidence for the potential role of EREG in HBsAg binding."

13689,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains an important cause of acute and chronic liver disease globally and in the United States. An encouraging trend is that the incidence of acute hepatitis B in the United States declined as much as 80% between 1987 and 2004, attributable to effective vaccination programs as well as universal precautions in needle use and in healthcare in general. Although encouraging, these decreases in acute infections have not translated into diminished prevalence or burden of chronic HBV infection. The prevalence for HBV in the United States has been estimated to be approximately 0.4%. However, these estimates have been based on surveys conducted in samples in which population groups with high prevalence of HBV infection, namely foreign-born minorities, were underrepresented. Voluntary screening data indicate prevalence in excess of 15% in some of these groups. Recent immigration trends suggest a substantial increase in the number of Americans with chronic HBV infection. This trend is reflected in the health and economic burden associated with HBV infection. The number of outpatient visits and hospitalizations for a HBV-related diagnosis increased several-fold during the 1990s. Similarly, the total charges for hospitalizations have been estimated to have increased from $357 million in 1990 to $1.5 billion in 2003. Most recent data indicate that death and liver transplant waitlist registration for HBV-related liver disease, which had been increasing, have now reached a plateau or started to decline. This encouraging trend might be attributable to recent advances in treatment for HBV infection; however, to the extent that the number of Americans living with chronic HBV is growing, careful clinical monitoring and continued epidemiologic surveillance remain important."
18430,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy among HIV patients is the most important patient-enabled factor related to virological failure and can lead to drug resistance. It is important to avoid virological failure, especially in resource-limited settings where treatment options are limited and the effects of treatment failure are profound. This qualitative study aimed to identify the psycho-social factors related to adherence behaviour in Gaborone, Botswana, a high prevalence setting in southern Africa. One-to-one, in-depth interviews were conducted with adult antiretroviral patients in the private and public health sectors who had been on antiretroviral therapy for a minimum of 6 months. A grounded theory approach was adopted and patients were selected purposively and theoretical sampling determined the final sample size. Thirty-two patients were interviewed, 22 from the public-sector, the mean age was 9.5 years and 53% were women. We found that acceptance of HIV-status, the ability to avoid internalising stigmatising attitudes and identification of an encouraging confidante were key factors related to good adherence. Encouraging confidantes (including clinicians) and contributed to promoting hope and acceptance of HIV-status, enabling patients to develop a positive therapeutic relationship with their antiretrovirals and make lifestyle changes that promoted adherence. Active participation in a social network and a desire to avoid being thin and visibly identifiable as HIV-positive were also adherence-motivating factors. Conversely, participants who expressed some degree of denial about their HIV-status tended to express emotions associated with depression, and internalised stigma that inhibited the development of a relationship with a confidante. We feel it is important to identify individuals with HIV who are still in some degree of denial about their status and to identify depression among patients on antiretrovirals. This will enable more targeted, individualised support in the management of individuals' HIV disease."
14741,0.005,1.0000,"Despite the Mozambique government's efforts to curb human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), national prevalence is 11.5% and support is needed to expand HIV-related services and improve program quality. Positive prevention (PP) programs, which prioritize HIV prevention with people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHIV), have been recognized as an important intervention for preventing new HIV infections. To address this, an evidence-based PP training intervention was implemented with HIV healthcare providers in Mozambique. This study focuses on the acceptability and feasibility of a PP intervention in HIV clinics from the healthcare provider perspective. In-depth interviews were conducted with 31 healthcare providers from three provinces who participated in PP trainings in Mozambique. Interview data were coded using content analysis. Study data suggest that healthcare providers found PP acceptable, feasible to implement in their HIV work in clinic settings, and valued this strategy to improve HIV prevention. The PP training also led providers to feel more comfortable counseling their patients about prevention, with a more holistic approach that included HIV testing, treatment and encouraging PLHIV to live positively. While overall acceptance of the PP training was positive, several barriers to feasibility surfaced in the data. Patient-level barriers included resistance to disclosing HIV status due to fear of stigma and discrimination, difficulty negotiating for condom use, difficulty engaging men in testing and treatment, and the effects of poverty on accessing care. Providers also identified work environment barriers including high patient load, time constraints, and frequent staff turnover. Recognizing PP as an important intervention, healthcare providers should be trained to provide comprehensive prevention, care and treatment for PLHIV. Further work is needed to explore the complex social dynamics and cultural challenges such as gender inequalities, stigma and discrimination which hinder the full impact of PP interventions in this context.

9959,0.005,1.0000,"In 1996 Nowak and his colleagues proposed a differential equation virus infection model, which has been widely applied in the study for the dynamics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Biological dynamics may be described more practically by discrete events rather than continuous ones. Using discrete systems to describe biological dynamics should be reasonable. Based on one revised Nowak et al's virus infection model, this study introduces a discrete virus infection model (DVIM). Two equilibriums of this model, E1 and E2, represents infection free and infection persistent, respectively. Similar to the case of the basic virus infection model, this study deduces a basic virus reproductive number R0 independing on the number of total cells of an infected target organ. A proposed theorem proves that if the basic virus reproductive number R0<1 then the virus free equilibrium E1 is locally stable. The DVIM is more reasonable than an abstract discrete susceptible-infected-recovered model (SIRS) whose basic virus reproductive number R0 is relevant to the number of total cells of the infected target organ. As an application, this study models the clinic HBV DNA data of a patient who was accepted via anti-HBV infection therapy with drug lamivudine. The results show that the numerical simulation is good in agreement with the clinic data. "
4117,0.005,1.0000,"With significant reductions in AIDS-related morbidity and mortality, HIV is increasingly viewed as a chronic condition. However, people on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are experiencing new challenges such as metabolic and morphological body changes, which may affect self-perceived body image. The concept of body image is complex and encompasses an individual's perception of their existential self, physical self and social interpretation of their body by others. The Longitudinal Investigations into Supportive and Ancillary Health Services (LISA) cohort is a prospective study of HIV-positive persons on ART. An interviewer-administered survey collects socio-demographic and health information including body image, stigma, depression, food insecurity, and quality of life (QoL). In bivariate analyses, Chi-squared or Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare individuals reporting positive body image with those reporting negative body image. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine associations between negative body image and covariates. Of 451 LISA participants, 47% reported negative body image. The adjusted multivariate analysis showed participants who reported high stigma in the presence of depressive symptoms were more likely to have negative body image compared to people reporting low stigma and no depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.41, confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-4.68). The estimated probability of a person having positive body image without stigma or depression was 68%. When stigma alone was included, the probability dropped to 59%, and when depression was included alone the probability dropped to 34%. Depressive symptoms and high stigma combined resulted in a probability of reporting positive body image of 27%. Further efforts are needed to address body image among people living with HIV. In order to lessen the impacts of depression on body image, such issues must be addressed in health care settings. Community interventions are also needed to address stigma and negative body image to improve the lives of people living with HIV."

Children of HIV-infected parents in China are particularly affected. The present study examined the relationship between associative stigma, self-esteem, optimism, anxiety and depression among 195 children of HIV-infected parents in rural China. Findings showed that more than one-third (35.4 %) of the participants scored higher than cut-off for depression; and 23.6-67.7 % of them scored higher than cut-off for different types of anxiety disorders. Structural equation modelling revealed that associative stigma had a significant negative relationship on self-esteem and optimism, which were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. The indirect effects of associative stigma on depression and anxiety were significant. The overall model showed a satisfactory fit. Findings suggest that associative stigma has a significant negative impact on mental health of children affected by HIV. Interventions to reduce their associative stigma are warranted."

The survival status of patients until October 31, 1999 was ascertained from the hospital records, mailing letters, and death certificates at the Provincial Health Office. Of 1110 patients who attended the clinic, we had data on duration of follow-up for 1081 (97%) with a total of 1175 person-years of observation; 607 (54.7%) patients died. Clinical status, CD4 group, ARV drug group, and registered year were independently associated with death. The adjusted hazard ratio of monotherapy to no therapy was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.87; p = .001) and that of dual therapy was 0.43 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.62; p < .001). The mortality rate of patients attending a government hospital in northern Thailand is high. Suboptimum ARV drug regimens like dual therapy had a substantial survival benefit. Further cost reduction for multiple ARV drug regimens is impatiently awaited."
1080,0.005,1.0000,"The impact of pretreatment anaemia on survival in individuals with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection is not known. Moreover, HCV treatment is offered less frequently to individuals with anaemia, due to haematological side effects of the treatment regimen. This study aimed to determine the effect of HCV treatment on survival among HCV/HIV co-infected individuals with pretreatment anaemia using the Electronically Retrieved Cohort of HCV-Infected Veterans (ERCHIVES). Individuals with HCV/HIV co-infection were included in current analyses. Participants were considered treated if they were prescribed ≥ 4 weeks of HCV treatment. All-cause mortality data were obtained using record linkage. Survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models. Among 5000 HCV/HIV co-infected individuals, 1671 (33.4%) had pretreatment anaemia. In a follow-up period of up to 7 years (19,500 person-years), individuals with anaemia had significantly higher mortality rate compared with those without anaemia [144.2 (95% CI: 134.5-154.7) vs 47.5 (44.0-51.2) per 1000 person-years, respectively]. Among individuals with anaemia, HCV treatment was associated with significantly lower mortality rate [66.6 (44.3-100.2) vs 149.6 (139.2-160.5) per 1000 person-years, for treated vs untreated, respectively]. Treatment remained associated with substantial survival benefit after taking into account the effect of multiple comorbidities (hazards ratio: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.21-0.62). These data suggest that HCV/HIV co-infected individuals with pretreatment anaemia have significantly higher mortality compared with those without anaemia. HCV treatment is associated with substantial survival benefit in this group. Additional studies are needed to determine strategies to improve HCV treatment rates among this group."
4410,0.005,1.0000,"Individuals living with HIV often have complicated histories, including negative experiences such as traumatic events, mental illness, and stigma. As the medical community in the United States adapts to managing HIV as a chronic disease, understanding factors such as these negative experiences that may be associated with poorer adherence to treatment regimens, greater HIV risk behavior, and lower patient quality of life becomes critical to HIV care and prevention. In less wealthy nations, these issues are also critical for addressing quality of life as well as medication adherence in the areas where antiretroviral therapies are being made available. This article presents a review of the literature regarding the following psychosocial factors as they relate to HIV/AIDS in the US and globally: traumatic events; mental illness, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder; lack of trust in the healthcare system and government; and experiences of stigma among individuals with HIV disease. These factors have been found to be prevalent among individuals with HIV/AIDS, regardless of gender or race/ethnicity. Traumatic events, mental illness, distrust, and stigma have also been linked with poorer adherence to medication regimens and HIV risk behavior."
1945,0.005,1.0000,"Widening of the electrocardiographic (ECG) spatial QRS-T angle has been predictive of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in the general population. However, its prognostic significance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients remains unknown. The spatial QRS-T angle was derived from the baseline resting 12-lead electrocardiogram of 4,453 HIV-infected patients aged 43.5 ± 9.3 years from the Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) trial. CVD events were identified during a median follow-up of 28.7 months. Quartiles of the spatial QRS-T angle was calculated for men and women separately, and values in the upper quartile were considered as a widened angle (values >74° for women and >93° for men). A multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to examine the association between a widened baseline spatial QRS-T angle and incident CVD events. During 11,965 person-years of follow-up, 152 CVD events occurred at a rate of 1.27 events/100 person-years. The rate of CVD events in those with a widened spatial QRS-T angle was almost double the rate in those with a normal spatial QRS-T angle (rate ratio 1.94, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 2.69; p <0.001). In a model adjusted for study treatment arm, demographics, CVD risk factors, HIV characteristics, inflammatory markers, and other ECG abnormalities, a widened spatial QRS-T angle was associated with a >50% increased risk of CVD events compared to a normal spatial QRS-T angle (hazard ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.17; p = 0.02). No interaction was seen by SMART trial arm (p value for interaction = 0.37) or gender (p value for interaction = 0.84). In conclusion, a widened spatial QRS-T angle was independently predictive of CVD events in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. This highlights the potential role of routine electrocardiography as a simple noninvasive CVD risk-screening tool in HIV-infected patients."
8566,0.005,1.0000,"This report updates and consolidates all previous U.S. Public Health Service recommendations for the management of health-care personnel (HCP) who have occupational exposure to blood and other body fluids that might contain hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Recommendations for HBV postexposure management include initiation of the hepatitis B vaccine series to any susceptible, unvaccinated person who sustains an occupational blood or body fluid exposure. Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and/or hepatitis B vaccine series should be considered for occupational exposures after evaluation of the hepatitis B surface antigen status of the source and the vaccination and vaccine-response status of the exposed person. Guidance is provided to clinicians and exposed HCP for selecting the appropriate HBV PEP. Immune globulin and antiviral agents (e.g., interferon with or without ribavirin) are not recommended for PEP of hepatitis C. For HCV postexposure management, the HCV status of the source and the exposed person should be determined, and for HCP exposed to an HCV positive source, follow-up HCV testing should be performed to determine if infection develops. Recommendations for HIV PEP include a basic 4-week regimen of two drugs (zidovudine [ZDV] and lamivudine [3TC]; 3TC and stavudine [d4T]; or didanosine [ddI] and d4T) for most HIV exposures and an expanded regimen that includes the addition of a third drug for HIV exposures that pose an increased risk for transmission. When the source person's virus is known or suspected to be resistant to one or more of the drugs considered for the PEP regimen, the selection of drugs to which the source person's virus is unlikely to be resistant is recommended. In addition, this report outlines several special circumstances (e.g., delayed exposure report, unknown source person, pregnancy in the exposed person, resistance of the source virus to antiretroviral agents, or toxicity of the PEP regimen) when consultation with local experts and/or the National Clinicians' Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline ([PEPline] 1-888-448-4911) is advised. Occupational exposures should be considered urgent medical concerns to ensure timely postexposure management and administration of HBIG, hepatitis B vaccine, and/or HIV PEP."
17971,0.005,1.0000,"Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who subsequently develop an acute sexually transmitted disease have an increased probability of transmitting HIV. Therefore, characterizing such persons can help direct prevention efforts to a group who are likely to be continuing sources of HIV transmission. We assessed the incidence and factors associated with trichomoniasis in a cohort of HIV-infected women receiving care at a public clinic in Los Angeles County, California from 1992 through 1995. Demographic, clinical, and behavioral data were available from medical records and from patient interviews. Trichomonas infection was the most frequently identified sexually transmitted disease and was found in 37 (17.4%) of 212 women representing a crude incidence rate of 14.1 per 100 person-years experience. The crude rate of trichomoniasis was highest in black women (69.0 per 100 person-years), women with a history of trading sex for drugs or money (51.0 per 100 person-years), those using crack or cocaine (35.5 per 100 person-years), women with four or more sex partners (43.0 per 100 person years), and those born in the United States (23.3 per 100 person-years). Among women with severe immunosuppression (CD4+ count < 200), 18.4% (18 of 98) were diagnosed with trichomoniasis. After multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazards approach, black race (adjusted rate ratio [RR] = 5.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.3, 13.3) continued to be strongly associated with Trichomonas infection. Trading sex for money or drugs (adjusted RR = 25.2, 95% CI = 4.3, 148.6) and single marital status (adjusted RR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.1, 13.0) were independent risk factors for trichomoniasis in nonblack women but not among black women. Data from this study indicate that Trichomonas may be a frequently acquired infection in HIV-positive women. Our findings suggest that HIV-infected women who are black, and nonblack women who trade sex for money or drugs or are unmarried, are at increased risk of trichomoniasis and therefore may be more likely to transmit HIV infection. Local HIV prevention strategies should target such women for intervention efforts."

Of 700 (92.6%) patients with complete data, the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positivity was 11.9% and 3.3%, respectively. Eight (9.6%) HBV co-infected patients did not have anti-HBV core antibody (anti-HBcAb). During 1166.7 person-years of observation (pyo), 258 (36.9%) patients died [22.1/100 pyo, 95% confidence interval (CI) 16.7–27.8]. HBV and probably HCV co-infection was associated with a higher mortality with adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of 1.81 (95% CI 1.30–2.53) and 1.90 (95% CI0.98–3.69), respectively. Interestingly, HBV co-infection without anti-HBc Ab was strongly associated with death (aHR 6.34, 95% CI 3.99–10.3). The influence of hepatitis co-infection on the natural history of HAART-naive HIV patients requires greater attention."
1628,0.005,1.0000,"The incidence of biologic false-positive rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests may be increased in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; however, injecting drug use has not been excluded as the cause. Review of 3371 periodic syphilis serology results from 1077 HIV-seropositive patients in the United States Air Force HIV Natural History Study between January 1986 and June 1992 revealed a cumulative biologic false-positive RPR rate of 1%. Most (6/9) were transient low-titer results associated with a recent acute infectious process. False-positive RPR tests did not appear to correlate with anticardiolipin antibody levels or serum IgG or IgA levels, which are increased in HIV infection. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend toward higher IgM levels in patients with biologic false-positive tests. Thus, the incidence of false-positive RPR in an HIV-infected population with a low risk of injecting drug use is similar to that in the general population, and the mechanism may correlate with elevated serum IgM levels."
9833,0.005,1.0000,"The evaluation of viral load as virological marker and its clinical and immunological correlation are presented. The first viral load studies were performed during 1996 at the National Reference Center for AIDS in Argentina in HIV-1 positive patients derived from different Hospitals in Buenos Aires. The study included 216 HIV-1 positive patients, 49 females and 167 males. Plasma was used for evaluating viral load and a second sample was obtained in 25 of the 216 patients for their monitoring. Viral load was performed using bDNA technique (Quantiplex HIV RNA assay 2.0, Chiron Corporation, USA). Other parameters such as CD4 count determined by flow cytometry and clinical stages according to CDC classification were obtained in order to correlate clinical and immunological status of the patients. When CD4 count was compared with viral load, the results showed a trend of viral RNA increase in plasma along with a decrease in CD4+ lymphocytes. This trend was also observed to correlate with the progression to AIDS disease. In all groups of patients, considering either CD4 counts or clinical status, ranges of viral load values were broad. Thus, as shown by percentiles 25 and 75, patients with CD4 counts < 200/ml, presented viral load values between 18,395 c/ml to 215,425 c/ml and patients with > 200/ml viral RNA showed values from < 10,000 to 35,180 c/ml. Patients with CDC's A and B stages presented values from < 10,000 to 45,160 c/ml and 87,000 c/ml respectively, while patients classified as C had 10,582 to 215,000 c/ml. Results of two consecutive samples in the 25 patients showed the usefulness of this technique for monitoring antiretroviral therapy. Nevertheless, despite the tendency of viral load to increase along with the progression of the disease, the broad range of values suggested the importance of using both virological and immunological parameters for the management of HIV infected patients."

Melatonin, the main hormone produced by the pineal gland, seems to promote a Th1 response by increasing the production of IL-12 in vitro.

19516,0.005,1.0000,"The factors that determine the emergence of X4 isolates in some HIV-1-infected subjects are unknown. As the level of expression of CXCR4 could favor an R5 to X4 switch, quantitative flow cytometry was used to measure CXCR4 density on CD4 T cells in 200 HIV-1-positive adults, and this was compared with CD4 counts, interleukin-7 (IL-7), and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted) plasma levels and the R5/X4 virus phenotype. CD4 T-cell surface CXCR4 densities were increased in infected subjects and inversely correlated with CD4 T-cell count (r=-0.548, P<0.001). Yet, in vitro infection with either R5 or X4 strains and in vivo increases in viral load following interruption of antiretroviral treatment did not induce CXCR4 overexpression. The plasma levels of IL-7 and RANTES, 2 cytokines able to induce CXCR4 expression, did not correlate with CXCR4 density. Finally, higher CXCR4 densities were observed in patients harboring X4 strains (3300, 95% CI 2431-4169 CXCR4 molecules per cell) than in patients harboring only R5 strains (2406, 95% CI 2135-2677, P=0.027). These data suggest that CXCR4 overexpression during the course of the disease in some patients could favor the emergence of X4 strains."
903,0.005,1.0000,"We developed a scheme using routinely available data to estimate the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) dementia in HIV-infected persons over time. We performed a longitudinal review of medical records from more than 100 medical facilities in 11 U.S. cities. A total of 19,462 HIV-infected persons without history of dementia enrolled in a multi-institution survey. The main outcome measure was the development of HIV dementia (1987 case definition) during the median follow-up period of 17 months (range, 1 to 72 months). Of 19,462 HIV-infected persons, HIV dementia developed in 880 persons (4.5%; 2.6% per person-year). The strongest predictors of HIV dementia were CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, anemia, and AIDS-defining infections or cancer. The 2-year probability of HIV dementia was highest for persons who had a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of fewer than 100 cells/microL and an AIDS-defining illness or anemia or both (18.6 to 24.9%). Intermediate risk was observed in persons with CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 100 to 199 cells/microL and an AIDS-defining illness or anemia or both or in persons with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of fewer than 100 cells/microL but without another risk factor (2-year probability, 10.4 to 15.2%). The 2-year probability that HIV dementia would develop was lowest (1.0%) for persons with CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of more than 200 cells/microL and no other risk factors. Risk stratification using routine clinical information provides information that may prove useful in patient care decisions."
7883,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) continues to spread at an alarming rate. The virus may be transmitted through blood, genital secretions, and breast milk, and higher levels of systemic virus in the index case, as measured by plasma RNA viral load, have been shown to correlate with increased risk of transmitting HIV-1 both vertically and sexually. Less is known about the correlation between transmission and HIV-1 levels in breast milk or genital secretions, in part because reliable quantitative assays to detect HIV-1 in these fluids are not available. Here we show that the Gen-Probe HIV-1 viral load assay can be used to accurately quantify viral load in expressed breast milk and in cervical and vaginal samples collected on swabs. Virus could be quantified from breast milk and swab samples spiked with known amounts of virus, including HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and D. As few as 10 copies of HIV-1 RNA could be detected above background threshold levels in > or =77% of assays performed with spiked breast milk supernatants and mock swabs. In genital swab samples from HIV-1-infected women, similar levels of HIV-1 RNA were consistently detected in duplicate swabs taken from the same woman on the same clinic visit, suggesting that the RNA values from a single swab sample can be used to measure genital viral load."
3389,0.005,1.0000,"Entamoeba histolytica is not a common causative agent of acute appendicitis. However, amoebic appendicitis can sometimes be severe and life threatening, mainly due to a lack of awareness. Also, its frequency, clinical features, and pathogenesis remain unclear. The study subjects were HIV-1-infected individuals who presented with acute appendicitis and later underwent appendectomy at our hospital between 1996 and 2014. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded preserved appendix specimens were reexamined by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining and PCR to identify undiagnosed amoebic appendicitis. Appendectomies were performed in 57 patients with acute appendicitis. The seroprevalence of E. histolytica was 33% (14/43) from the available stored sera. Based on the medical records, only 3 cases were clinically diagnosed as amoebic appendicitis, including 2 diagnosed at the time of appendectomy and 1 case diagnosed by rereview of the appendix after the development of postoperative complications. Retrospective analyses using PAS staining and PCR identified 3 and 3 more cases, respectively. Thus, E. histolytica infection was confirmed in 9 cases (15.8%) in the present study. Apart from a significantly higher leukocyte count in E. histolytica-positive patients than in negative patients (median, 13,760 versus 10,385 cells/μl, respectively, P = 0.02), there were no other differences in the clinical features of the PCR-positive and -negative groups. In conclusion, E. histolytica infection was confirmed in 9 (15.8%) of the appendicitis cases. However, only 3, including one diagnosed after intestinal perforation, were diagnosed before the present analyses. These results strongly suggest there is frequently a failure to detect trophozoites in routine examination, resulting in an underestimation of the incidence of amoebic appendicitis."
8704,0.005,1.0000,"The impact of prior antiretroviral experience on adherence and clinical outcomes in patients initiating a new highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen is not well defined. We performed an observational cohort analysis of antiretroviral-experienced or -naive HIV-infected patients prescribed a new HAART regimen (3538 patients) and enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California from 1997 through 2002. Outcomes evaluated were HAART adherence and changes in HIV RNA level and CD4 T-cell counts over 12 and 24 months. The antiretroviral-naive group had a significantly greater odds of achieving >/=95% adherence to the HAART regimen over 12 months (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.88, p < 0.001) and over 24 months (OR = 1.66, p < 0.001). The odds of achieving HIV RNA levels below limits of quantification also was higher among patients who were antiretroviral naive; over 24 months OR = 6.88, p < 0.001. Adjusted change in CD4 T-cell count was also greater among naive patients over 24 months (+67 cells/muL, p < 0.001), compared to antiretroviral-experienced patients. Years of antiretroviral experience did not affect adherence or any outcome measure. Adjusting for HAART adherence did not significantly affect HIV RNA results but did lessen CD4 T-cell count differences between antiretroviral-naive and -experienced patients. Thus, antiretroviral naive patients have improved HAART adherence, HIV RNA control, and CD4 T-cell count increases compared to antiretroviral-experienced patients regardless of years of antiretroviral experience. These findings should help direct HAART adherence efforts in HIV care clinics."

Dates of HIV seroconversion were determined retrospectively from frozen sera. HCV assays were performed by a ""second generation"" four-antigen recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA 2). Liver failure was found after a latency period of 10 to 20 years in 9% of multitransfused HCV-positive/HIV-positive adult hemophiliacs without an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or malignancy. Lymphocytopenia, decreased CD4 counts, and, possibly, thrombocytopenia were associated with liver failure which appeared to be accelerated by HIV disease and its treatment. This form of severe liver disease is being seen with increasing frequency among multi-transfused persons with hemophilia who are coinfected with HCV and HIV."

Macaque models of simian immunodeficiency virus-Mycobacterium bovis BCG (SIV/BCG) coinfection were employed to determine the extent to which anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis immunity can be restored by antiretroviral therapy. Both SIV-infected macaques with active BCG reinfection and naive animals with simultaneous SIV/BCG coinfection were evaluated. The suppression of SIV replication by antiretroviral treatment resulted in control of the active BCG infection and blocked development of the fatal SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease. The resolution of this disease coincided with the restoration of BCG purified protein derivative (PPD)-specific T-cell immune responses. In contrast, macaques similarly coinfected with SIV/BCG but not receiving antiretroviral therapy had depressed PPD-specific primary and memory T-cell immune responses and died from tuberculosis-like disease. These results provide in vivo evidence that the restoration of anti-mycobacterial immunity by antiretroviral agents can improve the clinical outcome of an AIDS virus-related tuberculosis-like disease."

Entecavir has demonstrated high efficacy and a favorable safety profile for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatment, but data for patients undergoing HBV-related LT are limited. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of entecavir combined with various HBIG regimens after CHB-related LT. In this phase 3b, single-arm, open-label study, 65 patients undergoing LT for CHB-related liver disease with an HBV DNA load <172 IU/mL at LT received entecavir (1.0 mg daily) for 72 weeks after LT. The primary endpoint was the proportion of evaluable patients (treated for ≥4 weeks) with virological recurrence (HBV DNA level ≥50 IU/mL) through week 72. Concomitant HBIG therapy was received by 64 of the 65 enrolled patients, and 44% of these patients received high-dose HBIG (any HBIG dose in the specified interval ≥10,000 IU). Through week 72, all 61 patients evaluable for the efficacy analysis had undetectable HBV DNA. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of patients without hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) recurrence at week 72 was 0.9655. Two patients experienced a reappearance of HBsAg, but both remained HBV DNA(-) until the last follow-up. The frequency and nature of adverse events were consistent with those expected for this patient population. Serum creatinine increments ≥0.3 mg/dL and ≥0.5 mg/dL occurred in 62% and 39% of the patients, respectively, and all of these patients received calcineurin inhibitor therapy. In conclusion, in this population of patients treated with entecavir after CHB-related LT, entecavir was well tolerated and effective in maintaining viral suppression, even in individuals who experienced a reappearance of HBsAg."

7641,0.005,1.0000,"We analyzed retrospectively, by use of logistic regression, the role of the phenotypic susceptibility score (PSS) as a determinant of virologic outcome in a study of treatment-experienced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected subjects. A model for PSS in which each drug was treated equally and scored as active or inactive was not predictive of HIV-1 RNA load (VL) suppression. However, weighting the potential contribution of each drug on the basis of inferred potency and by use of a continuous scale to quantify drug susceptibility revealed significant associations between PSS and outcome. Entry VL was a strong independent predictor of therapy outcome, and PSS was a strong predictor of the magnitude of the initial decrease in VL. This suggests that the prospective evaluation of PSS to identify regimens that maximize decreases in VL to reduce the probability of virologic rebound could improve antiretroviral treatment."
13942,0.005,1.0000,"We have investigated a potential transmission chain of HIV-1 with drug resistance-associated mutations between three individuals over a period of 5 years by use of cloning and sequencing of viral genes, and phenotypic characterization. Viruses containing reverse transcriptase drug resistance-associated mutations were transmitted sequentially between three homosexual men (A, B, and C), and persisted in one individual for at least 4 years, despite intermittent therapy and reduced viral replicative capacity compared with wild-type strains. Clonal analysis of the envelope gene from semen and blood virus showed that the virus transmitted to patient C was more closely related to virus from the semen than the blood of patient B. Our data suggest that HIV variants with drug resistance-associated mutations can persist following primary infection, despite intervening antiretroviral therapy, and subsequently sexually transmitted. We provide ""proof of principle"" that such mutations can therefore become ""fixed"" within the circulating virus pool."

High 4-months adherence [odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 3.72 (1.98 to 6.98)] was associated with long-term prolonged viral suppression, irrespective of maintenance adherence. This unexpected long-term virological impact of early adherence reinforces the message that, when starting antiretrovirals, all means should be mobilized to ensure optimum early adherence to achieve prolonged antiretroviral success."

To assess the frequency and trends of methamphetamine use, sexual activity, injection drug use, patient-provider communication, and medication adherence among HIV-infected persons in care, we administered a one-page anonymous survey in 2004 and 2006. The survey was conducted at the two University of California, San Francisco outpatient HIV clinics: at Moffitt Hospital (Moffitt), serving primarily privately insured patients, and at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), a county hospital serving primarily patients who are uninsured or publicly insured. In 2006, 39% of men who have sex with men (MSM), 33% of heterosexual men, and 11% of women reported methamphetamine use in the prior 12 months. Methamphetamine use was significantly associated with an increased number of sex partners among MSM and heterosexual men, and poor anti-retroviral medication adherence. Among MSM, methamphetamine use was more common at the SFGH clinic. Between 2004 and 2006, reported methamphetamine use in the last 12 months decreased among MSM at Moffitt (38 to 20%, p<0.01), but increased at SFGH (40 to 50%, p<0.05). Among methamphetamine users we found a high frequency of injection of methamphetamine, which increased at SFGH from 38 to 55%, p<0.05. Patient-provider communication regarding methamphetamine use has increased from 2004 to 2006 but no significant change has been found for providers asking patients about sexual activity. Overall, we found methamphetamine use to be common among HIV-infected patients in care, and associated with an increased number of sex partners, a high frequency of injection drug use, and poor adherence to anti-retroviral medications. These findings support the need for improved screening and clinic-based interventions to reduce and treat methamphetamine abuse and associated high risk sexual behaviors."
1729,0.005,1.0000,"Dysfunction of the dopaminergic system accompanied by loss of dopamine in the striatum is a major feature of human immunodeficiency virus-1-associated dementia. Previous studies have shown that human immunodeficiency virus-1-associated dementia patients with a history of drug abuse have rapid neurological progression, prominent psychomotor slowing, more severe encephalitis and more severe dendritic and neuronal damage in the frontal cortex compared with human immunodeficiency virus-1-associated dementia patients without a history of drug abuse. In a previous study, we showed that methamphetamine and human immunodeficiency virus-1 protein Tat interact to produce a synergistic decline in dopamine levels in the rat striatum. The present study was carried out to understand the underlying cause for the loss of dopamine. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered saline, methamphetamine, Tat or Tat followed by methamphetamine 24 h later. Two and seven days later the animals were killed and tissue sections from striatum were processed for silver staining to examine terminal degeneration while sections from striatum and substantia nigra were processed for tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity. Striatal tissue was also analyzed by Western blotting for tyrosine hydroxylase protein levels. Compared with controls, methamphetamine+Tat-treated animals showed extensive silver staining and loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity and protein levels in the ipsilateral striatum. There was no apparent loss of tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra. Markers for oxidative stress were significantly increased in striatal synaptosomes from Tat+methamphetamine group compared with controls. The results indicate that methamphetamine and Tat interact to produce an enhanced injury to dopaminergic nerve terminals in the striatum with sparing of the substantia nigra by a mechanism involving oxidative stress. These findings suggest a possible mode of interaction between methamphetamine and human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection to produce enhanced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in human immunodeficiency virus-1 infected/methamphetamine-abusing patients."
6961,0.005,1.0000,Measuring the survival of human immunodeficiency virus-infected adult patients enrolled in antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs is complicated by short observation periods and loss to follow-up. We synthesized data from treatment cohorts in sub-Saharan Africa to estimate survival over 5 years after initiation of ART.
15999,0.005,1.0000,"We investigated the effects of glutathione (GSH), the major naturally occurring thiol, and a pharmacologic thiol precursor of GSH, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), on the expression of human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) in primary cord blood and adult donor monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). HIV-1 infection of cord blood and adult MDM was accomplished after incubating 10-15-d-old cultures for 4 h with a monocyte-tropic strain of HIV-1 (Bal). After 1 wk in culture cell supernatants were tested for reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. MDM were exposed to 5, 10 and 20 mM concentrations of both GSH and NAC before infection, during infection, and after infection was established. GSH and NAC suppressed the replication of HIV-1 in both primary cord blood and adult donor MDM in a concentration dependent fashion. These suppressive effects were more pronounced in cord-derived cells than in adult-derived cells. In cells treated with GSH or NAC before infection, there was no significant rise in RT activity as compared with controls. Similarly, when cells were treated with GSH and NAC and simultaneously infected, there was also no significant rise in RT activity after 1 wk in culture. In cells treated after infection was established, RT values were suppressed 80-90% that of untreated controls. This effect persisted for 1-2 wk after exposure to GSH and NAC. Untreated controls demonstrated syncytium formation and lost characteristics of spreading and elongation 2 wk after HIV-1 infection, whereas most of the treated cells remained free of syncytium and retained cytoplasmic spreading, adherence, and elongation. These data are consistent with other studies of thiol suppression of HIV-1 replication and demonstrate a similar observation for primary cultured cord MDM. These results may offer new approaches toward cellular protection after infection with HIV-1."
11212,0.005,1.0000,"Disclosure of HIV-positive status has important implications for patient outcomes and preventing HIV transmission, but has been understudied in TB-HIV patients. We assessed disclosure patterns and correlates of non-disclosure among adult TB-HIV patients initiating ART enrolled in the START Study, a mixed-methods cluster-randomized trial conducted in Lesotho, which evaluated a combination intervention package (CIP) versus standard of care. Interviewer-administered questionnaire data were analyzed to describe patterns of disclosure. Patient-related factors were assessed for association with non-disclosure to anyone other than a health-care provider and primary partners using generalized linear mixed models. Among 371 participants, 95% had disclosed their HIV diagnosis to someone other than a health-care provider, most commonly a spouse/primary partner (76%). Age, TB knowledge, not planning to disclose TB status, greater perceived TB stigma, and CIP were associated with non-disclosure in unadjusted models (p < .1). In adjusted models, all point estimates were similar and greater TB knowledge (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-0.90) and CIP (aOR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.79) remained statistically significant. Among 220 participants with a primary partner, 76% had disclosed to that partner. Significant correlates of partner non-disclosure (p < .1) in unadjusted analyses included being female, married/cohabitating, electricity at home, not knowing if partner was HIV-positive, and TB knowledge. Adjusted point estimates were largely similar, and being married/cohabitating (aOR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.12), having electricity at home (aOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17-0.85) and greater TB knowledge (aOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.98) remained significant. In conclusion, although nearly all participants reported disclosing their HIV status to someone other than a health-care provider at ART initiation, nearly a quarter of participants with a primary partner had not disclosed to their partner. Additional efforts to support HIV disclosure (e.g., counseling) may be needed for TB-HIV patients, particularly for women and those unaware of their partners' status."
5754,0.005,1.0000,"The growth of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV) infection among women in the USA has been coincident with an international momentum to better address the specific health care needs of women. This paper provides an overview of a demonstration model for comprehensive HIV care of adolescent and adult women in an academic setting. The paper contains a descriptive summary of a university-based demonstration model of comprehensive care for women with HIV infection. During 1997-1998, there were 279 urban and rural Midwest adolescent and adult women with HIV infection in care at this model programme. Medical care encompassed subspecialty HIV care, obstetrical and gynaecological care, primary care of non-HIV comorbidities, mental health assessments and family planning in a safe, university-based environment. For 279 women during the two-year period, health services included the detection and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (56%) and cervical dysplasia (35%), perinatal care (12%) and screening and referral for substance abuse treatment (30%). There was no mother-to-child HIV transmission among 33 pregnant women enrolled in the Center prior to delivery, and transmission by three of nine women enrolled after delivery. Only 167 (60%) women were compliant with biannual medical visits during 1997-1998. Integral to the health services delivery was the provision of ancillary support services intended to enhance optimal medical care for this cohort of women. This university-based model of care also incorporated HIV provider training and formative HIV research. Structured medical and public health experiential learning opportunities occurred for medical and social work students, medicine residents, infectious diseases fellows, nurses and other professional health care workers. Clinical investigations of adolescent and adult women have complemented care and training, with funded research in HIV medication adherence and health services research. In follow-up, 71% of these women remained active in care in 1999. Retention of vulnerable populations in care may be a big challenge over the next decade, despite the availability of potent antiretroviral therapies."
12120,0.005,1.0000,"Both foscarnet (PFA) and zidovudine (AZT) select for drug-resistant variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but the interactions between the mutations causing such resistance are unknown. The introduction of the previously identified PFA resistance mutation W to G at codon 88 (W88G), E89K, L92I, or Q161L into an HIV-1 strain having the four known AZT resistance mutations completely reversed high-level AZT resistance. Two additional PFA resistance mutations, W88S and S156A, partially suppressed AZT resistance. Phenotypic reversion of AZT resistance by W88S, W88G, E89K, L921, and S156A was associated with a concomitant suppression of PFA resistance. The degree to which PFA resistance mutations reversed AZT resistance was directly correlated with each mutation's ability to confer high-level PFA resistance (> or = 5.0-fold) and AZT hypersusceptibility in a wild-type genetic background. Highly PFA-resistant HIV- 1 strains were hypersusceptible to AZT; conversely, AZT-resistant strains with M41L and T215Y; M41L, L210W, and T215Y; or M41L, D67N, K70R, and T215Y mutations were 2.2- to 2.5-fold hypersusceptible to PFA. Prolonged in vitro selection of wild-type or AZT-resistant HIV-1 strains with the combination AZT and PFA failed to generate coresistant virus, indicating that dual resistance was relatively difficult to achieve. Strains selected by passage in PFA plus AZT were phenotypically PFA resistant and AZT susceptible despite multiple reverse transcriptase mutations known to confer AZT resistance. These data show that PFA resistance mutations can phenotypically reverse AZT resistance and that AZT and PFA resistance might be mutually exclusive. The reciprocal interactions between AZT and PFA resistance-conferring mutations have implications for structure-function studies of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase."
3089,0.005,1.0000,"We determined the prevalence of three emergent urogenital mycoplasma species (M. fermentans, M. penetrans, and M. genitalium) in comparison to the most common species (M. hominis and U. urealyticum). M. genitalium is probably the third most frequent agent of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) in men. It has been suggested that M. fermentans and M. penetrans play a role in the development of AIDS. We analysed the urine and the urethral swab samples from 106 HIV-1 infected individuals (HIV group) and 110 HIV-negative patients with NGU (STD group) by using PCR and culture methods. M. genitalium was detected in 0.9% of the urine and in 1.9% of the urethral samples from the HIV group, compared to 9.1% found only in urethral swab samples from the STD group. M. fermentans was detected in 5.7% urethral swabs from the HIV group and in 0.9% from the STD group. M. penetrans was detected in 6.6% urine samples from the HIV group. M. hominis and U. urealyticum showed infection rates of 7.5 and 18.9% in the HIV group, and 0.9 and 13.6% in the STD group. Overall there was a higher prevalence of mycoplasmas in the HIV group than in the STD group, but the significance of these results remains unclear."
18270,0.005,1.0000,"GB virus C (GBV-C) and hepatitis G virus (HGV) are two isolates of the same virus, independently identified in humans in the 1990s by two research laboratories, and were initially considered a potential cause of liver disease. Studies failed to associate the virus with hepatitis or any known human disease. GBV-C reappeared in the scientific scene when some research groups, in an attempt to find the interference of the virus among HIV seropositive patients, reported a lower mortality rate and slower disease progression among co-infected patients. From then on, several mechanisms have been proposed to clarify this putative benefit; however, the question whether GBV-C exerts a protective effect in HIV-infected patients remains to be resolved."
14933,0.005,1.0000,"As increasing numbers of persons are placed on potentially life-saving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in sub-Saharan Africa, it is imperative to identify the psychosocial and social factors that may influence antiretroviral (ARV) medication adherence. Using an 87 question survey, the following data were collected from patients on cART in Botswana: demographics, performance (Karnofsky) score, perceived stigma and level of HIV disclosure, attitudes and beliefs concerning HIV/AIDS, substance and/or drug use, depression, and pharmacy and healthcare provider-related factors. Overall adherence rates were determined by patient self-report, institutional adherence, and a culturally modified Morisky scale. Three hundred adult patients were recruited between April and May 2005. The overall cART adherence rate was 81.3% based on 4 day and 1 month patient recall and on clinic attendance for ARV medication refills during the previous 3 months. Adults receiving cART for 1-6 months were the least adherent (77%) followed by those receiving cART for greater than 12 months (79%). Alcohol use, depression, and nondisclosure of positive HIV status to their partner were predictive of poor adherence rates (p value <0.02). A significant proportion (81.3%) of cART-treated adults were adherent to their prescribed treatment, with rates superior to those reported in resource-rich settings. Adherence rates were poorest among those just starting cART, most likely due to the presence of ARV-related toxicity. Adherence was lower among those who have been treated for longer periods of time (greater than 1 year), suggesting complacency, which may become a significant problem, especially among these long-term cART-treated patients who return to improved physical and mental functioning and may be less motivated to adhere to their ARV medications. Healthcare providers should encourage HIV disclosure to ""at-risk"" partners and provide ongoing counseling and education to help patients recognize and overcome HIV-associated stigma, alcohol abuse, and depression."
5078,0.005,1.0000,"Controversy surrounds the issue of screening for the human immunodeficiency virus in pregnancy. The question remains: Which pregnant women should be tested? To answer this question, it is clear that local prevalence data of seropositivity must be known. At present, these figures are unavailable for midwestern metropolitan areas such as ours. Therefore an obstetric human immunodeficiency virus screening committee was formed to determine the prevalence of seropositivity of this virus in our obstetric clinic population. During a 14-month period of time all patients registering for prenatal care were offered human immunodeficiency virus antibody testing. A total of 585 out of 751 patients (78%) gave informed consent. Forty-two of these patients had risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection. The rate of seropositivity in this group was 7.1% (3 of 42). The remaining 543 patients had no risk factors and none of these patients had positive test results. From our preliminary results, screening only those prenatal patients with identified risk factors appears to be justified."
18504,0.005,1.0000,"From among 2,375 young men, examined by doctors, 111 tattooed subjects were found. Twenty one subjects reported engaging in promiscuous sexual behavior or being intravenous drug abusers, and so were excluded. The other 90 were evaluated. To make up the control group, 180 non-tattooed subjects from the remaining 2,264, who neither engaged in promiscuous sexual activity nor were intravenous drug abusers, were matched from household registry reports by age, sex, education, occupation, and geographic origin from Mainland China, where their parents were born. IgG antibody of hepatitis A (anti-HAV) and markers of hepatitis B were tested in serum with radioimmunoassay. In the prevalence rate of hepatitis A and carrier rate of HBsAg there were no differences between the tattooed and the non-tattooed groups. However, the prevalence odds ratio of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection for the tattooed group was 8.1 (95% CI 1.9-34.8) as compared to the non-tattooed groups. Moreover, there was a trend correlation when the prevalence rates of hepatitis B were compared for the group with multiple sites of tattoos, for the group with one site of tattoos, and for the non-tattooed group (p = 0.002). These findings suggested an association between HBV infection and tattooing. Tattoo exposure, with improper or no sterilization of the needle, seems to appear to increase the risk of HBV infection in the already high risk endemic area in question."

Authors have reported the improvement of epidemiological situation among employees of the Child Health Center in the years 1987-1994 and analysed factors which were the probably cause of improvement (protective vaccination, infection control, and education of workers). In the first year of observation, among ca. 1700 health care workers 32 new hepatitis B infections were noted, while in 1994 there were no hepatitis B cases."
6783,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-(1/2)), human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I/II), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Treponema pallidum and Trypanosoma cruzi among 63 male prisoners in Manhuaçu, Minas Gerais, Brazil and to compare this with data from eligible blood donors. The positive results were as follows: 11/63 (17.5%) for HBV, 5/63 (7.4%) for syphilis, 4/63 (6.3%) for HCV, 3/63 (4.8%) for Chagas' disease, 2/63 (3.2%) for HIV-1/2 and 1/63 (1.6%) for HTLV-I/II. The seroprevalence in prisoners was higher than among blood donors, mainly for antibodies to HIV-1/2, HCV and HBV. This is probably due to low social economic level, illiteracy, higher proportion with a prior history of intravenous drug use and/or unsafe sexual behavior. Therefore, these prisoners constitute a high-risk group and routine screening and counseling are recommended."
14447,0.005,1.0000,"Zidovudine delays the progression of disease in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but it can cause serious adverse reactions, a fact which makes zidovudine treatment undesirable to some patients. In this study, zidovudine was offered to HIV-infected patients with CD4 leukocyte counts between 200 and 500 cells/microL, and the acceptance or refusal of therapy was recorded over a 4-month period. Of 73 patients approached, 49 (67%) consented to the therapy (23 asymptomatic and 26 with AIDS-related complex). The high acceptance rate of zidovudine among both asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic HIV patients raises the question of finding additional financial resources and health care providers for close monitoring of side effects."
6119,0.005,1.0000,"As a model system to study the infection of early myeloid cells by human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), we have infected the human promyelocytic cell line, HL-60, with a recombinant selectable HIV-1 clone. A fully infected population showed a relatively high frequency of low-level infection, with 40% of subcloned cells being negative by reverse transcriptase and p24 indirect immunofluorescence analysis and displaying only low levels of supernatant p24. The same treatment of a T-lymphoid cell line produced 100% productive infections. HIV-1 infection of HL-60 did not appear to alter the state of differentiation of the cells, as assessed by surface antigen expression, regardless of the level of viral expression. Furthermore, infected cells were able to respond normally to chemical inducers of differentiation. Induction of differentiation towards monocyte/macrophages by phorbol myristate acetate activated the HIV-1 long terminal repeat in a transient transfection system, and there was a corresponding increase in viral production from the infected subclones. Granulocytic differentiation, as stimulated by dimethyl sulfoxide or retinoic acid, had no effect on long terminal repeat activity and did not stimulate viral replication. These data suggest that low-level HIV-1 infections may be established at a relatively high frequency in myeloid precursor cells, and that different pathways of promyelocytic differentiation vary in their ability to stimulate HIV-1 replication."
17684,0.005,1.0000,"Increasing data support host genetic factors as an important determinants of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) susceptibility, mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), and disease progression. Of these genetic mediators, those impacting innate and adaptive immune responses seem to play a critical role in viral infectivity and pathogenesis. During primary infection, CCR5 using virus is predominantly transmitted and polymorphisms that affect the expression of CCR5 alter the risk for MTCT and rate of disease. Chemokines that naturally bind to coreceptors alter infectivity and viral pathogenesis. Additional genes that affect innate immunity including those encoding for MBL2 and those modulating the adaptive immune response including CX3CR1 and human leukocyte antigen types can significantly modify susceptibility and response to HIV-1 infection. As young children develop, the dependence on certain arms of the immune system varies and can alter the effect of genetic variants. Additionally, host genetic factors may alter the response to antiretrovirals. Finally, because HIV-infected children progress more rapidly than adults and have fewer background cofactors, such as drug use and coinfections, the effects of host factors on HIV-1 disease may be more clearly identified. In this review, we summarize available data on the impact of host genetics on MTCT and disease progression of HIV-infected children."
1629,0.005,1.0000,"Vitamin A and other retinoids have profound effects on macrophage differentiation and function. Such effects could alter interactions between HIV and tissue macrophages, a principal target cell and reservoir for virus during HIV disease. Indeed, retinoids are used to treat various symptoms associated with HIV infection. We show that levels of virus replication in monocytes cultured 7 days before and continuously after HIV infection in 1 to 10 microM retinoic acid were 10- to 20-fold greater than those of control cells. No direct toxicity (detachment from substrate or cell death) was evident in infected or control monocytes treated with less than or equal to 10 microM retinoic acid. Maximum effects of retinoic acid (50% maximum effect was at 0.8 +/- 0.1 microM) required 5 to 7 days treatment before infection and persisted without additional treatment through more than 4 wk. RT activity in cultures of retinoic acid-treated monocytes reached maximum levels much earlier than those of control cultures, but the minimum tissue culture infectious doses for retinoic acid-treated and untreated monocytes were comparable. Retinoic acid treatment did not affect susceptibility of monocytes to HIV infection. Further, the frequency of infected cells in retinoic acid-treated and control cultures were also comparable: about 20% of cells in each culture expressed HIV proteins or RNA 2 wk after infection. In contrast, levels of HIV-specific RNA and DNA were 3- to 5-fold higher in the retinoic acid-treated over control monocytes 1 wk after infection. That retinoic acid increased levels of HIV gene expression in monocyte cultures without affecting the number of infected cells per culture suggested a transcriptional mechanism for the effect. This was confirmed in the U937 myeloid cell line transfected with HIV LTR linked to a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene. Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity in lysates of retinoic acid-treated cells were 20-fold higher than that of control cells. These data show that retinoic acid significantly increased HIV replication in monocytes through mechanisms related to cell differentiation and to a direct transcriptional effect on viral gene expression."
2174,0.005,1.0000,"To determine the correlates of immune recovery from active human CMV (HCMV) disease, we compared the antigenic repertoire, diversity, magnitude, and differentiation of HCMV-specific CD8+ T cells in HIV-HCMV coinfected subjects with no, cured, or active HCMV disease and in healthy HIV-negative HCMV-positive controls. ELISPOT-IFN-gamma assays using peptide pools spanning the pp65 and immediate early 1 (IE1) HCMV proteins showed that HCMV-specific CD8+ T cells had a significantly broader antigenic repertoire and greater diversity in HIV-positive patients controlling HCMV replication than in those with active HCMV disease, but the magnitude of the CD8 T cell response did not differ between the different groups. HCMV-specific T cells mainly were focused against IE1 during the short-term recovery from retinitis, and switched toward pp65 during long-term recovery. HCMV-specific T cells displaying an ""early"" (CD8+CD27+CD28+) and ""intermediate"" (CD8+CD27-CD28+) differentiation phenotype were increased significantly during long-term recovery compared with other HIV-positive patients and were nearly undetectable during active HCMV disease. HCMV-specific T cells with a ""late"" (CD8+CD27-28-) differentiation phenotype predominated in all cases. Therefore, restoration of immune protection against HCMV after active HCMV disease in immunodeficient individuals is associated with enlarged repertoire and diversity, and with early differentiation of virus-specific CD8+ T cells, thus defining immune correlates of protection against diseases caused by persistent viruses."

Multiple areas of stenosis and occlusion in all branches of the circle of Willis, and hypertrophy of collateral perforating vessels at the base of the brain in a ""puff of smoke"" appearance typical of moyamoya disease were seen on cerebral angiogram 5 months before the patient died. At autopsy, the patient had meningovascular syphilis and a necrotizing encephalitis with massive treponemal invasion of the brain, the pathology of late-stage degenerative, ""quaternary"", neurosyphilis. The patient was also infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Retrovirus-like particles 100 nm in diameter with dense cores were seen by electron microscopy. Nucleic acid obtained from the patient's brain contained sequences homologous to HIV DNA as determined by dot blot hybridization. The moyamoya-like radiologic appearance of neurosyphilis has not been previously described. The autopsy finding of quaternary neurosyphilis in a patient with HIV infection supports the hypothesis that retrovirus may alter the natural history of syphilitic infection."

HBV does not appear to alter HIV disease progression; however, HBV infection is more frequent and more severe in the HIV-infected population, emphasizing the importance of preventing HBV infection. The goal of anti-HBV therapy is prevention of cirrhosis because therapy does not eradicate the hepatic reservoirs (cccDNA). The approved therapies-interferon-alfa, lamivudine, and adefovir-each have a niche in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in the HIV-infected population, but none has been well-studied in this setting.

However, most of these antiretrovirals are also potent inhibitors (and occasionally inducers) of hepatic and intestinal cytochrome P450 systems and, therefore, have the potential to alter the elimination of any substance that utilizes these metabolic pathways. We describe a patient infected with HIV-1 who was treated with ritonavir and saquinavir and then experienced a prolonged effect from a small dose of methylenedioxymetamphetamine (MDMA or ecstacy) and a nearly fatal reaction from a small dose of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). We also discuss the potential for HIV-1 protease inhibitors to alter the metabolism of other abusable prescribed and illicit substances."

These include an inappropriately normal triiodothyronine (T(3)) and reduced reverse triiodothyronine (rT(3)), and increased thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Opportunistic infections involving the thyroid gland, neoplasms such as lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma, and medications can alter the thyroid function in individuals with more advanced HIV infection. If thyroid dysfunction is diagnosed in an HIV-infected patient, it should be treated in the usual manner. However, high index of suspicion and caution in the interpretation of thyroid function tests in patients with HIV disease are needed for optimal diagnosis and treatment."

In this study we assessed whether 1,25D could improve the maturation defect we have previously demonstrated in monocytes from AIDS patients. In vitro growth and maturation of monocytes from 10 controls, 15 asymptomatic HIV positives (CDC group II or III) and 13 symptomatic HIV positives (CDC group IV) was examined by assessing cellular morphology, differentiation, adherence and protein content. Cells were cultured for 10 days with or without addition of 1,25D at a concentration of 100 pg/ml. In addition, patients were monitored clinically and by immunological parameters and HIV p24 antigen in serum. The present study showed that addition of 1,25D significantly improved the growth and maturation in both patient and control groups. There was a significant negative correlation between response to 1,25D and CD4+ lymphocyte count in blood in HIV-infected patients. A greater response to 1,25D was seen in monocytes from patients with advanced immunodeficiency and symptomatic disease than in monocytes from asymptomatic patients. However, in the most advanced cases of HIV infection with serious ongoing opportunistic infections the response to 1,25D was very poor, possibly reflecting profound and incorrigible dysfunction of monocytes."
9775,0.005,1.0000,"We sought to determine the pattern of resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) among HIV-1-infected children failing first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) and ascertain their response to second-line regimens in 48 weeks of follow-up. The design involved a cohort study within an HIV care program. We studied records of 142 children on ART with virological failure to first-line ART and switched to second-line ART with prior genotypic resistance testing. The pattern of RAMs was determined in frequency runs and the factors associated with accumulation of≥3 thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) and K103N were determined using multivariate logistic models. Changes in weight, height, CD4, and viral load at weeks 24 and 48 after switch to second-line therapy were determined using descriptive statistics. The children were mean age 10.9±4.6 years and 55.6% were male. The commonest nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) RAM was M184V in 129/142 (90.8%) children. TAMs,≥3 TAMs, 69 insertion complex, K65R/N, and Q151M were observed in 43.0%, 10.6%, 18.3%, 2.8%, and 2.1% of the children, respectively. The commonest nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) RAM was K103N in 72/142 (50.7%) children. The starting ART regimen was associated with accumulation of both≥3 TAMs (p=0.046) and K103N (p<0.0001), while a history of poor adherence was associated with K103N accumulation (p=0.0388). After 24 weeks and 48 weeks of follow-up on lopinavir-ritonavir based second-line ART, 86/108 (79.6%) and 84.5% (87/103) of the children had viral loads<400 copies/ml, respectively. The mean CD4 absolute count increased by 173 cells/μl and 267cells/μl at weeks 24 and 48, respectively. Increments were also observed in mean weight (1.6 kg and 4.3 kg) and height (1.8 cm and 5.8 cm) at weeks 24 and 48, respectively. Multiple RAMs were observed among HIV-1-infected children with virological failure on first-line ART with M184V and K103N most frequent. The children responded favorably to boosted PI-based second-line ART."

11036,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious public-health issue in China. While the hepatitis B vaccine is effective in preventing HBV infection, the HBV vaccination coverage rates among Chinese adults remain low. From a survey of rural adults from 7 provinces in China, we identified a unique HBV at-risk group: rural adults who had no history of HBV vaccination and had no plan to HBV vaccinate in the future. We divided this 'no history-no plan' group into those who identified No-need to vaccinate and those that perceived a Need to vaccinate (even if they had no plan to do so). We found age, marital status, health status, perceived HBV infection environment, perceived HBV infection risk and perceived HBV infection severity explained differences between the 'No-need' and 'Need"" to HBV vaccinate groups. Education, occupation and knowledge of hepatitis B and HBV transmission were not associated with HBV vaccination need. Our results showed that free HBV vaccinations and reimbursement for vaccinating could significantly increase the HBV vaccinate take-up rate for both Need and No-need rural adults. A tailored public health HBV campaign, especially targeting the No-need subgroup, would increase vaccination rates by better informing rural adults about HBV transmission routes, the dangers of HBV infection, the effectiveness of HBV vaccinations and the safety of HBV vaccinations."

Large randomized studies of newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as escitalopram in the treatment of depression in HIV, examining comparative treatment efficacy and safety, have yet to be done in HIV-positive patients. This was a fixed-dose, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study to investigate the efficacy of escitalopram in HIV-seropositive subjects with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, major depressive disorder. One hundred two participants were randomly assigned to either 10 mg of escitalopram or placebo for 6 weeks. An analysis of covariance of the completers found that there was no advantage for escitalopram over placebo on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (p = 0.93). Sixty-two percent responded to escitalopram and 59% responded to placebo on the Clinical Global Impression Scale. Given the relatively high placebo response, future trials in this area need to be selective in participant recruitment and to be adequately powered. "
6541,0.005,1.0000,"Although viral hepatitis infection is known to be associated with aplastic anemia, a causal link between viral hepatitis and aplastic anemia has not been convincingly demonstrated. A case of hepatitis B-associated severe aplastic anemia is described which only partially responded to conventional immunosuppressive treatment but went into complete clinical remission after clearance of the hepatitis B virus. Disappearance of the hepatitis B virus occurred during lamivudine treatment and coincided with immune activation secondary to discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy. This case was somewhat atypical in that a history of acute hepatitis preceding the aplastic anemia was absent. The observation made in this case report supports a cause-effect relationship between hepatitis B virus infection and aplastic anemia."
583,0.005,1.0000,"We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 96 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who received intramuscular pentamidine for the prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). These patients, all of whom had either a history of PCP or a CD4 lymphocyte count of < or = 0.2 x 10(9)/L, were intolerant of sulfa drugs, neutropenic, or intolerant of aerosolized treatment. Intramuscular pentamidine was given monthly by the Z-track technique at a dosage of 300 mg (4 mg/kg if the patient weighed < 50 kg). During a total of 350 months of primary prophylaxis in 47 patients and 426 months of secondary prophylaxis in 49 patients, only three cases of PCP occurred. More than 73% of the patients were receiving zidovudine concomitantly. Adverse reactions to intramuscular pentamidine included two episodes of hypotension, three of sterile abscess, two of glucose intolerance, and one of asymptomatic hypoglycemia. The administration of intramuscular pentamidine by the Z-track technique for PCP prophylaxis appears to be highly effective and minimally toxic."
3787,0.005,1.0000,"The decision to operate on carriers of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who need an urgent cardiac operation is difficult. There is a lack of knowledge about the effect of the presence of HIV on operative risk, about the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on the progression of HIV infection to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and about the risk to the cardiac surgical team of operating on 1 or more HIV carriers. This lack of knowledge is exacerbated by the strict regulations surrounding testing. We polled the board-certified cardiac surgeons in the United States on their willingness to perform open cardiac procedures on HIV carriers and AIDS patients. Fifty-three percent of the surgeons responded. Two thirds of them will operate on HIV carriers who need an urgent cardiac operation but regard the presence of AIDS as a contraindication to cardiopulmonary bypass. This is presumably a medical judgment. Those who will not operate on HIV carriers are apparently motivated by fear rather than moral judgments concerning the patients. Virtually all surgeons want to be able to test ""high-risk"" patients, and a substantial majority would test all patients."
4636,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the incidence, determinants and significance of delayed clearance of serum HBsAg in chronic hepatitis B virus infection, a prospective follow-up study was conducted in two consecutive groups of patients. Group I consisted of 984 patients (859 men and 125 women) with biopsy-proven chronic type B hepatitis, whereas group II consisted of 1,598 asymptomatic chronic carriers (998 men and 600 women) with normal serum aminotransferase activity. During a mean follow-up period of 4.0 +/- 2.3 yr, 19 patients (1.9%) of group I cleared HBsAg from their serum, whereas 35 patients (2.2%) in group II did so in a mean follow-up period of 2.7 +/- 1.4 yr. The annual incidence of delayed serum HBsAg clearance was 0.5% in group I and 0.8% in group II (p less than 0.02). The cumulative probability of HBsAg clearance was also higher in group II than in group I (p less than 0.007). Antibodies to HBsAg developed in 9 patients (47.4%) with chronic hepatitis and in 11 (31.4%) asymptomatic carriers who cleared serum HBsAg. Those who were HBeAg negative and those older than 40 at entry and those who exhibited cirrhosis during follow-up had a higher incidence of delayed HBsAg clearance. Gender, initial histological changes and hepatitis delta virus infection did not influence the occurrence of HBsAg clearance. Serum HBV DNA was not detectable by slot-blot hybridization but was still detectable by polymerase chain reaction in serum specimens collected within 1 yr of HBsAg clearance. Liver biopsy performed later in 10 patients showed no significant hepatitis activity or tissue HBV DNA, HBsAg or HBcAg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
10740,0.005,1.0000,"Our objective was to determine the level of adherence and reasons for non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among HIV-positive (HIV+) people on ART in a resource-limited setting. Patients receiving ART were recruited into the cross-sectional study from three treatment centres in Kampala, Uganda. The number of missed doses over the last three days was assessed by structured patient interviews and dichotomized at +/-95% adherence. Reasons for non-adherence were assessed with both structured patient interviews and unstructured qualitative interviews. Independent predictors of non-adherence were assessed with multivariate logistic regression. In all, 304 HIV-infected persons on ART were enrolled into the study. Factors associated with non-adherence were marital status (odds ratio (OR) = 2.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-6.50) and low monthly income <50 US$ [OR = 2.77, 95% CI 1.64-4.67]. We concluded that levels of self-reported adherence in patients receiving ART in Kampala are comparable to levels in resource-rich settings with inability to purchase and secure a stable supply as a major barrier to adherence."
15764,0.005,1.0000,"We compared adherence to cART and virological response between indigenous and immigrant HIV-infected patients in the Netherlands, and investigated if a possible difference was related to a difference in the psychosocial variables: HIV-stigma, quality-of-life, depression and beliefs about medications. Psychosocial variables were assessed using validated questionnaires administered during a face-to-face interview. Adherence was assessed trough pharmacy-refill monitoring. We assessed associations between psychosocial variables and non-adherence and having detectable plasma viral load using logistic regression analyses. Two-hundred-two patients participated of whom 112 (55%) were immigrants. Viral load was detectable in 6% of indigenous patients and in 15% of the immigrants (P < 0.01). In multivariate analyses, higher HIV-stigma and prior virological failure were associated with non-adherence, and depressive symptoms, prior virological failure and non-adherence with detectable viral load. Our findings suggest that HIV-stigma and depressive symptoms may be targets for interventions aimed at improving adherence and virological response among indigenous and immigrant HIV-infected patients."

Contacts were followed for > or = 12 mo. TB infection at enrollment was 27% (28/104) among contacts of HIV-seropositive TB patients and 35% (90/256) among contacts of HIV-seronegative TB patients (odds ratio [OR] = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41 to 1.12; p = 0.130).

TB was diagnosed in nine contacts; eight were contacts of HIV-seronegative index cases. HIV seropositivity in the index case was independently associated with a lower risk of TB infection among contacts, even among household contacts younger than 15 yr of age.

6884,0.005,1.0000,"A novel lipodystrophy syndrome characterized by insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and fat redistribution has recently been described in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men and women. Women with the HIV lipodystrophy syndrome exhibit a marked increase in waist-to-hip ratio and truncal adiposity; however, it is unknown whether androgen levels are increased in these patients. In this study, we assessed androgen levels in female patients with clinical lipodystrophy based on evidence of significant fat redistribution in the trunk, extremities, neck and/or face (LIPO: n = 9; age, 35.7+/-1.7 yr; BMI, 24.7+/-0.8 kg/m2) in comparison with age- and BMI-matched nonlipodystrophic HIV-infected females (NONLIPO: n = 14; age, 37.6+/-1.1 yr; BMI, 23.4+/-0.6 kg/m2) and healthy non-HIV-infected control subjects (C: n = 16; age, 35.8+/-0.9 yr; BMI, 23.1+/-0.4 kg/m2). Fasting insulin, lipid levels, virologic parameters, and regional body composition using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry were also assessed. Total testosterone [ LIPO, 33+/-6 ng/dL (1.1+/-0.2 nmol/L); NONLIPO, 17+/-2 ng/dL (0.6+/-0.1 nmol/L); C, 23+/-2 ng/dL (0.8+/-0.1 nmol/L); P < 0.05 LIPO vs. C and LIPO vs. NONLIPO] and free testosterone determined by equilibrium dialysis [LIPO, 4.5+/-0.9 pg/mL (16+/-3 pmol/L); NONLIPO, 1.7+/-0.2 pg/mL (6+/-1 pmol/L); C, 2.4+/-0.2 pg/mL (8+/-1 pmol/L); P < 0.05 LIPO vs. C and LIPO vs. NONLIPO] were increased in the lipodystrophic patients. Sex hormone-binding globulin levels were not significantly different between LIPO and C, but were significantly lower in the LIPO vs. NONLIPO patients (LIPO 84+/-7 vs. NONLIPO 149+/-17 nmol/L, P < 0.05). The LH/FSH ratio was significantly increased in the LIPO group compared with the NONLIPO and C subjects (LIPO, 2.0+/-0.6; NONLIPO, 1.1+/-0.1; C, 0.8+/-0.1; P < 0.05 LIPO vs. NONLIPO and LIPO vs. C). Body fat distribution was significantly different between LIPO and C subjects. Trunk to extremity fat ratio (1.46+/-0.17 vs. 0.75+/-0.05, LIPO vs. C, P < 0.05) was increased and extremity to total fat ratio decreased (0.40+/-0.03 vs. 0.55+/-0.01, LIPO vs. C, P < 0.05). In contrast, fat distribution was not different in the NONLIPO group vs. control subjects. Among the HIV-infected patients, free testosterone correlated with percent truncal fat (trunk fat/trunk mass) (r = 0.43, P = 0.04). These data suggest that hyperandrogenemia is another potentially important feature of the HIV-lipodystrophy syndrome in women. Additional studies are necessary to determine the clinical significance of increased androgen levels and the relationship of hyperandrogenism to fat redistribution and insulin resistance in this population of patients."

We conducted a cross-sectional study among HIV-infected adults prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy and receiving care from nine clinics. Depression was screened using Patient Health Questionnaire 9 and facilitators of HIV medication adherence were assessed using an 11-item scale which yielded a total positive attitude to disease score. Prevalence ratios of non-adherence between different categories of potential risk factors were calculated. We compared mean 'facilitators to adherence' scores between the adherent and non-adherent population. Multivariable Poisson regression with robust variance was used to identify independent risk factors. Among the 211 respondents, nearly 20% were non-adherent, approximately 8% had either moderately severe or severe depression and mean score for combined facilitators to medication adherence was 33.35 (±7.88) out of a possible 44 points. Factors significantly associated with non-adherence included older age, female sex worker, moderate-to-severe depression and the combined facilitators to medication adherence score. These data from a broad range of clinical settings in Hyderabad reveal that key groups to focus on for adherence intervention are female sex workers, older persons and those with depression."
13675,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study is to assess adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected children using the pill count method, and determine factors leading to adherence failure. Records of 106 children living with HIV (CLHIV) age <15 years and on ART for >6 months were reviewed. Average adherence to ART by pill count method over preceding six months was calculated and re-assessed by 3-day recall method. The caregivers of 105 children and one child himself were interviewed about the problems encountered while giving ART. Median age of enrolled children was 104 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 77.3-133.8) months. Median duration of ART was 25 (IQR 16-35) months. The desired adherence level of >95% during six months of review assessed by pill count was achieved in 95.3% children. The 3-day recall method yielded >95% adherence in 99% children (p ≤ .001). Caregivers of 59 children (56.2%) reported multiple problems while administering drugs. In most instances, problems encountered were related to family/caregivers, the commonest being multiple caregivers, job constraints and death/illness in the family. In conclusion, we found a very high level of adherence to ART in CLHIV. Poor adherence was mainly associated with issues related to the family/caregivers."
9370,0.005,1.0000,"Mental distress is common in primary care and overrepresented among Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, but access to effective treatment is limited, particularly in developing countries. Explanatory models (EM) are contextualised explanations of illnesses and treatments framed within a given society and are important in understanding an individual's perspective on the illness. Although individual variations are important in determining help-seeking and treatment behaviour patterns, the ability to cope with an illness and quality of life, the role of explanatory models in shaping treatment preferences is undervalued. The aim was to identify explanatory models employed by HIV-infected and uninfected individuals and to compare them with those employed by local health care providers. Furthermore, we aimed to build a theoretical model linking the perception of mental distress to treatment preferences and coping mechanisms."

The efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF single-tablet regimen is the first once-daily, single-tablet, triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) formulation available for the treatment of HIV infection and, in the EU, is indicated for use in adults infected with HIV-1 who have been virologically suppressed for >3 months on their current ART regimen. In treatment-experienced adults with HIV-1 infection already virologically suppressed with ART, switching to once-daily triple combination therapy with efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF (including the single-tablet regimen) is effective in maintaining virological suppression and is generally well tolerated, according to several randomized, open-label or noncomparative multicentre trials and an open-label extension study of up to 96 weeks' duration. Moreover, additional data from some of these studies indicate that adherence to treatment was maintained or improved after switching to the once-daily triple combination, with patients generally preferring the efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF single-tablet regimen over their previous more complex regimen and (in one of two trials) finding it easier to follow. Thus, the efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF single-tablet regimen provides a convenient once-daily regimen for use in treatment-experienced adults that may confer an advantage over more complex or frequently administered regimens for which adherence to treatment is an issue."

HIV-related symptoms are associated with side effects and HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) complications. The purposes of this study were to estimate the frequency and intensity of HIV-related signs and symptoms in patients with HIV infection and to explore relationships between HIV-related symptoms and the HAART regimen. Data on a total of 172 HIV-positive patients enrolled in an HIV case management program were analyzed for this study. Participants experienced an average of 9.73+/-7.27 symptoms, with fatigue, dry mouth and weakness the most frequently reported. Average mean symptom intensity among participants was 13.24+/-11.48. Insomnia, depression and disorientation were the most severe symptoms. No differences were recorded between HIV-related symptoms and disease progression. Fatigue intensity showed significant differences between NRTI (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), +NNRTI (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) and NRTI+PI (protease inhibitors) based regimens (p=.03). In addition, cluster symptoms of confusion/distress among participants without HAART had a significantly higher mean intensity than those with HAART (t=2.0, df=1, p=.04). Our study indicated that symptom management for fatigue and early detection of psychological distress is needed to improve quality of life for people living with HIV/AIDS."

To examine the degree to which alterations in various neuroendocrine and psychological markers might be related to this phenomenon we measured plasma cortisol, beta-endorphin, denial coping strategies, intrusive thoughts related to AIDS risk, and several affective distress markers in 46 HIV-1 seronegative subjects at each of the timepoints previously studied. Results indicated that cortisol levels were elevated at study entry and decreased across the subsequent five-week period--mirroring the changes in mitogen responsivity across these timepoints. Analyses of individual differences showed that higher baseline cortisol and lower denial coping scores predicted lower PHA values at baseline. Persisting intrusive thoughts about risk of HIV-1 infectivity (after seronegativity notification) were consistently associated with higher plasma cortisol levels. Finally, beta-endorphin levels did not change significantly across the 10-week observation period, were not associated with psychological variables, and were inconsistently associated with immune functioning."

Tenofovir is extensively and rapidly excreted unchanged in the urine. In the expectation that tenofovir could potentially reach agricultural lands through the application of municipal biosolids or wastewater, and in the absence of any environmental fate data, we evaluated its persistence in selected agricultural soils. Less than 10% of [adenine-8-(14)C]-tenofovir added to soils varying widely in texture (sand, loam, clay loam) was mineralized in a 2-month incubation under laboratory conditions. Tenofovir was less readily extractable from clay soils than from a loam or a sandy loam soil. Radioactive residues of tenofovir were removed from the soil extractable fraction with DT(50)s ranging from 24±2 to 67+22days (first order kinetic model) or 44+9 to 127+55days (zero order model). No extractable transformation products were detectable by HPLC. Tenofovir mineralization in the loam soil increased with temperature (range 4°C to 30°C), and did not occur in autoclaved soil, suggesting a microbial basis. Mineralization rates increased with soil moisture content, ranging from air-dried to saturated. In summary, tenofovir was relatively persistent in soils, there were no extractable transformation products detected, and the response of [adenine-8-(14)C]-tenofovir mineralization to soil temperature and heat sterilization indicated that the molecule was biodegraded by aerobic microorganisms. Sorption isotherms with dewatered biosolids suggested that tenofovir residues could potentially partition into the particulate fraction during sewage treatment."

Several drugs are available to treat hepatitis B. The most potent and the one with the lowest risk of resistance appears to be tenofovir (TDF). However there are several questions that remain unanswered regarding the use of TDF, including the proportion of patients that achieves suppression of HBV viral load and over what time, whether suppression is durable and whether prior treatment with other HBV-active drugs such as lamivudine, compromises the efficacy of TDF due to possible selection of resistant HBV strains."
6991,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic infections by hepatitis B (HBV) and C virus (HCV) result in diagnosis and therapeutic issues in dialysis and kidney recipients patients. The exposure to nosocomial, including blood transfusion, risk explains the high prevalence of HBV and HCV infection in this setting. Chronic infection reduces the survival of both patients and allografts, including a specific risk of de novo glomerulonephritis. Cirrhosis was considered as a contra-indication to renal transplantation given the high risk of decompensation and death, questionning the indication of a combined liver and kidney transplantation. Thus, it is mandatory to screen HBV and HCV markers in all dialysis patients, whether or not they are candidates to transplantation. Liver biopsy allows evaluating the severity of the liver disease since the noninvasive markers of fibrosis appear to be less accurate in ""renal"" patients than in the general population and to better define antiviral therapeutic indications. HCV treatment was mainly based on pegylated interferon α (and low doses of ribavirin), which is contra-indicated in kidney recipients given the risk of graft rejection; HCV treatment is now based on the use of oral direct acting antivirals, which are very potent and well tolerated. HBV replication is now easily suppressed by second-generation nucleos(t)tidic analogues (entecavir and tenofovir), which will be indicated in all the dialysis patients with significant fibrosis (F2,3 or 4 according to the Metavir scoring system) and in any candidate to renal transplantation and to any HBsAg-positive kidney recipients. The best treatment remains preventive by anti-HBV vaccination for HBV and by the respect of universal hygiene rules for HCV. "

Total body water was measured by means of deuterium oxide dilution, fat free mass by means of total body dual X-ray absorptiometry, and BIA with a bioelectrical impedance analyzer. The use of standard prediction equations resulted in substantial error. Regression equations using height and BIA resistance for estimating total body water and fat free mass were developed and appear to improve accuracy for prediction. This study suggests that total body water and fat free mass can be estimated in children with HIV by means of BIA equations specifically developed for use with this group of children."

8260,0.005,1.0000,"A vaccine breakthrough occurred in a phase 1 clinical trial of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 candidate subunit vaccine. The vaccine antigen, gp120SF2, is a fully glycosylated protein produced in mammalian cells from the HIVSF2 isolate. After 4 immunizations, the subject developed neutralizing antibodies and lymphoproliferative responses to the gp120 protein. About 18 weeks after the last immunization, the subject became HIV infected. During the acute phase of infection, there was high virus burden, a decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes, increases in rgp120SF2-binding antibodies and HIVSF2- and HIVMN-neutralizing antibodies, and transient lymphoproliferative responses to HIV-1 envelope and core proteins. The nucleotide sequence of the V3 loop from 2 virus isolations displayed close similarity to the V3 sequence of the vaccine antigen. Thus, the immunologic responses induced by the vaccine in this subject did not protect him from HIV-1 infection."
5117,0.005,1.0000,"With increasing life expectancy due to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the spectrum of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated morbidity and mortality has shifted from opportunistic infections toward associated chronic medical conditions. We report on a 26-year-old female patient receiving HAART for HIV infection, who developed spontaneous thrombosis of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery, resulting in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She had none of the conventional risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease. Following diagnostic coronary angiography that showed a large (16x3.4 mm) spontaneous thrombus in the proximal LAD artery, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed with prior aspiration of the occluding thrombus and implantation of a bare-metal stent. The patient was discharged with instruction of appropriate medical therapy. This case highlights the association between immunosuppression with HAART, particularly protease inhibitors, and the development of accelerated atherosclerosis in patients with HIV infection."
11437,0.005,1.0000,"Body image disturbance is a common problem reported among sexual minority men living with HIV, and is associated with poor antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. Recently, a novel integrated intervention (cognitive behavioral therapy for body image and self-care; CBT-BISC) was developed and pilot tested to simultaneously improve body image and ART adherence in this population. Although CBT-BISC has demonstrated preliminary efficacy in improving ART adherence, the mechanisms of change are unknown. Utilizing data from a two-armed randomized controlled trial (N = 44 sexual minority men living with HIV), comparing CBT-BISC to an enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) condition, sequential process mediation via latent difference scores was assessed, with changes in body image disturbance entered as the mechanism between treatment condition and changes in ART adherence. Participants assigned to CBT-BISC reported statistically significant reductions in body image disturbance post-intervention, which subsequently predicted changes in ART adherence from post-intervention to long term follow-up (b = 20.01, SE = 9.11, t = 2.19, p = 0.028). One pathway in which CBT-BISC positively impacts ART adherence is through reductions in body image disturbance. Body image disturbance represents one, of likely several, mechanism that prospectively predicts ART adherence among sexual minority men living with HIV."
4681,0.005,1.0000,"A growing body of evidence indicates that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals are more likely to be infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) than HIV-negative individuals, possibly as a result of shared risk factors. There is also evidence that HIV-positive individuals who are subsequently infected with HBV are more likely to become HBV chronic carriers, have a high HBV replication rate, and remain hepatitis Be antigen positive for a much longer period. In addition, it is evident that immunosuppression brought about by HIV infection may cause reactivation or reinfection in those previously exposed to HBV. Furthermore, HIV infection exacerbates liver disease in HBV co-infected individuals, and there is an even greater risk of liver disease when HIV and HBV co-infected patients are treated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). Complicating matters further, there have been several reports linking HIV infection to 'sero-silent' HBV infections, which presents serious problems for diagnosis, prevention, and control. In sub-Saharan Africa, where both HIV and HBV are endemic, little is known about the burden of co-infection and the interaction between these two viruses. This paper reviews studies that have investigated HIV and HBV co-infection in sub-Saharan Africa, against a backdrop of what is currently known about the interactions between these two viruses."
4952,0.005,1.0000,"Many aspects of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been described in detail in the literature. However, there have been very few articles on the phenomenon of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS patients. The objective of this communication is to record the incidence of DVT in HIV/AIDS patients and the risks for development of embolic events and to emphasize the need for prevention and for the vigorous treatment of this complication. We conducted a retrospective review of HIV/AIDS-infected patients with DVT admitted to Mount Sinai School of Medicine/Cabrini Hospital in New York during the last 5 years. Analysis includes demographic data; risk factors for HIV/AIDS infection; associated medical problems; recent surgery; and laboratory findings including CD4 counts, platelet counts, prothrombin times, partial thromboplastin times, and plasma albumin levels; and image studies. From January 1995 to January 2000 4752 HIV/AIDS-infected patients were admitted. Of those admitted to the hospital 45 (0.95%) were found to have DVT. There were 36 males and nine females (mean age 43 years). Of the 45 patients 38 had infectious complications and 13 developed a malignancy. The distribution of the thromboses were the femoral vein in 23 patients, the popliteal vein in 20 patients, and the iliofemoral system in 2 patients. Twelve patients had recurrent DVT and three patients developed a pulmonary embolism. HIV/AIDS infection is a considerable risk for development of DVT in the lower extremity. Statistically DVT in HIV/AIDS is approximately 10 times greater than in the general population. Emphasis upon prevention and vigorous treatment of DVT is recommended."
7703,0.005,1.0000,"The preS1 domain of hepatitis B virus envelope proteins contains a site of attachment to the hepatocyte membrane that has been shown to evoke virus-neutralizing antibodies. Using synthetic peptides, we have examined kinetics and specificity of the anti-body response to preS1 during acute and chronic HBV infection. Antibodies against two continuous B cell epitopes, p (21-32) and p (32-47), which overlap with the virus receptor for hepatocytes, were detected in 17 (28%) and 28 (47%) patients, respectively, of 60 patients who were tested during acute hepatitis B. Serial testing demonstrated these anti-preS1 specificities in more than 50% of patients who became virus free. By contrast, five patients with chronic evolution of hepatitis B and 61 of 66 patients with an established chronic HBV infection were negative, independent of serological profile and liver disease activity. Fifteen (22.7%) patients with chronic hepatitis B were positive for antibody to the C-terminus p (94-117) preS1 sequence that, unlike the acute-phase anti-(21-32) and anti-(32-47) reactivities, did not behave as a virus-precipitating antibody. Acute-phase sera were found to also contain virus-precipitating antibodies directed against conformational preS1 epitopes. These results indicate that the preS1 site, which contains the binding activity for the hepatocyte membrane, elicits an early antibody response during acute hepatitis B. A defect in such antibody repertoire may participate in the chronicity process as a result of continuing reinfection of hepatocytes by circulating virions."

17679,0.005,1.0000,"Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids and serum samples from 153 patients with pulmonary symptoms who were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and underwent BAL were examined for the presence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) by conventional culture and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of CMV DNA. PCR detected CMV more frequently than did cultures of BAL fluid (PCR of BAL fluid, 53%; PCR of serum, 40%; and culture, 30%). In a multivariate model, development of extrapulmonary CMV disease was predicted by the finding of CMV in BAL fluid by culture (relative risk [RR], 8.0; confidence interval [CI], 3.8-16.8) or the finding of CMV DNA in serum (RR, 7.4; CI, 3.2-17.3) or BAL fluid (RR, 8.0; CI, 3.1-20.7) by PCR. Mortality was found to be similar for patients who did or did not have CMV detected by either culture or PCR. Detection of CMV DNA by PCR was a more rapid and sensitive technique than conventional culture. Detection of CMV DNA in BAL fluid or serum predicted subsequent development of extrapulmonary CMV disease but not death for HIV-infected patients with pulmonary symptoms."
1100,0.005,1.0000,"Monocyte/macrophages (MM) were isolated from HIV-1 seronegative individuals, infected with HIV-1 and examined for their ability to infect autologous T lymphocytes with and without concomitant presentation of exogenous Ag. HIV-1-infected MM presented tetanus toxin (TT) and streptokinase to T cells (as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation) comparable to presentation by uninfected MM. In these studies, it was observed that HIV-1-infected MM without additional exogenous Ag stimulated autologous T lymphocytes, however, to a lesser degree than with TT and streptokinase. Virus production in T cells appeared to be relative to the degree of stimulation with the highest levels of stimulation and infection observed when T cells were exposed to HIV-1-infected TT-presenting MM. Studies were carried out to examine some of the restricting elements in MM-mediated infection of T lymphocytes with and without TT presentation. Antibodies to CD4, as well as soluble immunopurified gp120, blocked cell-mediated infection indicating that infection of T cells was through the CD4 molecule as has been demonstrated with cell-free virus. In addition, soluble gp120 inhibited Ag presentation by HIV-1-infected and uninfected MM. mAb to MHC class II Ag HLA-DR and -DP blocked T cell infection by HIV-1-infected MM with and without presentation of TT. No effect was observed with mAb to MHC class I Ag. These results indicate that virus transmission to T lymphocytes can be mediated by HIV-1-infected MM and that these cells maintain their function as APC. Activation of T cells appears to be important in the process of T cell infection in this system inasmuch as antibodies that block Ag presentation and thus a T cell proliferative signal inhibit infection."
670,0.005,1.0000,"Lung infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality, even in the current antiretroviral therapy era. Pneumonia is the most common cause of admission in HIV-positive individuals in our centre as reported in a previously published study. The objective of this retrospective observational study was to further characterize these admissions, with respect to index of disease severity at presentation, organisms identified, and investigations pursued including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). There were 123 unique patients accounting for a total of 209 admissions from 2005 to 2015. An organism was isolated in only 33% of all admissions (68/209). The most common organism was Pneumocystis jirovecii with a frequency of 29% of all admissions. Eighty-seven percent of presentations were mild, and 13% were moderate by CURB-65 criteria. A total of 39 BALs were performed, of which 27 yielded an organism (69%). Considering the burden of disease, low diagnostic yield of the current diagnostic strategy and increased morbidity and mortality caused by pneumonia in HIV-positive individuals, further methods are needed to more accurately target therapy. The preponderance of mild disease in this study suggests that better diagnostic tests may identify individuals that can be candidates for outpatient therapy."
17555,0.005,1.0000,"Various cobalamins act as important enzyme cofactors and modulate cellular function. We investigated cobalamins for their abilities to modify productive human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection of hematopoietic cells in vitro. We show that hydroxocobalamin (OH-Cbl), methylcobalamin (Me-Cbl), and adenosylcobalamin Ado-Cbl (Ado-Cbl) inhibit HIV-1 infection of normal human blood monocytes and lymphocytes. The inhibitory effects were noted when analyzing the monocytotropic strains HIV-1-BaL and HIV-1-ADA as well as the lymphocytotropic strain HIV-1-LAI. Cobalamins did not modify binding of gp120 to CD4 or block early steps in viral life cycle, inhibit reverse transcriptase, inhibit induction of HIV-1 expression from cells with established or latent infection, or modify monocyte interferon-alpha production. Because of the ability to achieve high blood and tissue levels of cobalamins in vivo and the general lack of toxicity, cobalamins should be considered as potentially useful agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection."
6188,0.005,1.0000,"Clevudine shows high rates of virologic and biochemical responses in patients with chronic hepatitis B. However, the efficacy and safety of clevudine in patients with cirrhosis are unknown. The aims of this study were to evaluate the safety and to assess the virologic and the biochemical responses to clevudine in patients with cirrhosis with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We reviewed data from treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis B with and without cirrhosis who started clevudine between April 2007 and March 2008 (n = 52, hepatitis B without cirrhosis n = 21 and chronic hepatitis B with cirrhosis n = 31) at Korea University Ansan/Guro Hospital. All of the patients were treated for more than 48 weeks. The mean age was older in the patients with cirrhosis. Baseline HBV DNA levels were 6.9 and 7.78 log copies/mL (P = 0.042), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were 104.9 and 147.4 IU/L (P = 0.204), for those with and without cirrhosis, respectively. Virologic response (HBV DNA <1000 copies/mL) (87.1%vs 71.4%, P = 0.24) and biochemical response (83.9%vs 80.9%, P = 0.99) at week 48 were not significantly different between the two groups. Early virologic response at week 12 was even higher in the patients with cirrhosis (61.3%vs 28.6%, P = 0.026). Neither ALT flare nor newly onset hepatic decompensation was found in the patients with cirrhosis, whereas ALT flare was transiently observed in 14.3% of the chronic hepatitis group. In conclusion, although clevudine may produce a transient elevation of ALT during the early treatment period, such findings were not observed in patients with cirrhosis and the virologic and biochemical responses of the groups were comparable."
16007,0.005,1.0000,"To compare electronically monitored (MEMS) with self-reported adherence in drug users, including the impact of adherence on HIV load, we conducted a 6-month observational study of 67 antiretroviral-experienced current and former drug users. Adherence (percentage of doses taken as prescribed) was calculated for both the day and the week preceding each of 6 research visits. Mean self-reported 1-day adherence was 79% (median, 86%), and mean self-reported 1-week adherence was 78% (median, 85%). Mean MEMS 1-day adherence was 57% (median, 52%), and mean MEMS 1-week adherence was 53% (median, 49%). One-day and 1-week estimates were highly correlated (r>.8 for both measures). Both self-reported and MEMS adherence were correlated with concurrent HIV load (r=.43-.60), but the likelihood of achieving virologic suppression was greater if MEMS adherence was high than if self-reported adherence was high. We conclude that self-reported adherence is higher than MEMS adherence, but a strong relationship exists between both measures and virus load. However, electronic monitoring is more sensitive than self-report for the detection of nonadherence and should be used in adherence intervention studies."

Our aim was to evaluate the long-term therapeutic efficacy of the combination of interferon alpha-2b and thymosin-alpha1 compared with lamivudine plus interferon alpha-2b and interferon alpha-2b alone. Fifty-two patients with HbeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B were assigned to three different groups in a nonrandomized manner. Group 1 (n = 27) received thymosin-alpha1 [1.6 mg subcutaneously (sc), twice a week] and interferon alpha-2b (10 MIU sc, three times per week) for 26 weeks, subsequently followed by interferon alpha-2b monotherapy at the same dosage for an additional 26 weeks. Group 2 (n = 10) received interferon alpha-2b (10 MIU sc, three times per week) for 52 weeks. Group 3 (n = 15) received interferon alpha-2b (10 MIU sc, three times per week) and lamivudine [100 mg orally (po), q.d.] for 52 weeks, followed by continuous lamivudine (100 mg po, q.d.) therapy. By the end of 78 weeks, a sustained response (SR-6 mo) was seen in 74% (20/27) of the patients within Group 1. On the contrary, Groups 2 and 3 had sustained response rates of 40 (4/10) and 53.3% (8/15), respectively (p = 0.13). At the end of 12 months post-treatment in Group 1, a virological and biochemical response rate was seen in 70.3% of patients (19/27); in contrast, Groups 2 and 3 had response rates of 20 (2/10) and 26.6% (4/15), respectively (p = 0036). At the end of the 18-month post-treatment follow-up period, 71.4% (19/27) of patients in Group 1, 10% of patients in Group 2 (1/10), and 20% of patients in Group 3(3/15) preserved their sustained response (p = 0.0003). Interferon alpha-2b and thymosin-alpha1 combination therapy results in significant virological and biochemical response rates compared with standard therapeutic regimens and is well tolerated."
15343,0.005,1.0000,"In patients with chronic hepatitis C and HIV infection, responsiveness to the standard schedule of alpha-interferon (IFN) is unsatisfactory. To quantify the effectiveness of tailoring IFN dosage according to HCV viral load under treatment, we enrolled 41 patients (M/F 32/9) chronically coinfected by HCV and HIV with chronic liver disease. All were former i.v. drug addicts, with a mean age of 32+/-4 years, and had clinical and histological evidence of chronic hepatitis (10% with cirrhosis). The CDC stage was A1 in five, A2 in 14, A3 in eight, B2 in eight, B3 in three and C3 in three. Twenty four patients were on triple therapy with protease inhibitors, 11 were on two-drug anti-HIV regimens and three were untreated. IFN (alphan1 interferon) was started at 3 MU tiw and increased at 6 MU tiw at 4 weeks if serum HCV-RNA had not dropped by at least 50%. IFN was stopped at 24 weeks in non-responders. Eleven patients received a dose increase (total IFN dose at 24 weeks 396 MU), while 16 did not increase the initial dose (total IFN dose at 24 weeks 216 MU). Fourteen subjects stopped within the first weeks due to relapse of drug abuse (ten) or subjective intolerance (four). ALT and HCV-RNA levels were markedly decreased at week 4, and this reduction lasted up to 24 weeks. However only one patient had a complete biochemical and virological end-of-treatment response, which was maintained over a 24 weeks post-therapy follow-up. All other patients relapsed to baseline ALT and HCV-RNA values after stopping IFN. HIV viral load was slightly reduced under IFN therapy, while CD4 counts were unaffected. We conclude that raising the dose of IFN dose not eradicate HCV in most HIV-infected patients, even when HIV is well controlled by treatment. HCV viraemia and necroinflammation are temporarily suppressed by IFN, but the relevance of these surrogate endpoints to progression of liver disease and to survival cannot be assessed."
72,0.005,1.0000,"Few studies have examined the association between having an informal (unpaid) caregiver and viral suppression among persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) who are on antiretroviral therapy. The current study examined relationships between caregivers' individual and social network characteristics and care recipient viral suppression. Baseline data were from the BEACON study caregivers and their HIV seropositive former or current drug using care recipients, of whom 89 % were African American (N = 258 dyads). Using adjusted logistic regression, care recipient's undetectable viral load was positively associated with caregiver's limited physical functioning and negatively associated with caregivers having few family members to turn to for problem solving, a greater number of current drug users in their network, and poorer perceptions of the care recipient's mental health. Results further understandings of interpersonal relationship factors important to PLHIV's health outcomes, and the need for caregiving relationship-focused intervention to promote viral suppression among PLHIV.

4720,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus are transmitted by venereal contact or by the sharing of used needles during drug use. A questionnaire was administered to street youths admitting to prostitution and to a group denying prostitution, as well as to sexually active adolescents who lived with their family and were attending an adolescent medical clinic. The age, gender, race, number of sexual partners, condom use, illicit drug use, anal intercourse and admission to prostitution were recorded for each of the subjects. Serology was obtained for hepatitis B markers and human immunodeficiency virus antibody. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the factors which might predict hepatitis B serologic status. A single subject, who admitted to prostitution, was found to be human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive. Seven of 43 (16%) admitted prostitutes compared with 1 of 44 (2%) other street youth and none of 27 controls demonstrated anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies. The higher rate of seropositivity in admitted prostitutes was statistically significant (P less than 0.0097). Two seropositive prostitutes had IgM hepatitis B core antibody suggesting recent infection. Two factors, number of partners (P less than 0.0007) and practice of anal intercourse (P less than 0.05), were identified in the multiple regression analysis as predictive of seropositivity. Thus adolescents who live on the street are at increased risk for becoming infected with hepatitis B virus. The difficulty in ensuring vaccine coverage in this population would support calls for including hepatitis B vaccination as part of childhood immunization."
264,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag polyprotein binds most members of the cyclophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases. Of 15 known human cyclophilins, cyclophilin A (CypA) has been the focus of investigation because it was detected in HIV-1 virions. To determine whether CypA promotes HIV-1 replication, we deleted the gene encoding CypA (PPIA) in human CD4(+) T cells by homologous recombination. HIV-1 replication in PPIA(-/-) cells was decreased and not inhibited further by cyclosporin or gag mutations that disrupt Gag's interaction with cyclophilins, indicating that no other cyclophilin family members promote HIV-1 replication. The defective replication phenotype was specific for wild-type HIV-1 since HIV-2/SIV isolates, as well as HIV-1 bearing a gag mutation that confers cyclosporin resistance, replicated the same in PPIA(+/+) and PPIA(-/-) cells. Stable re-expression of CypA in PPIA(-/-) cells restored HIV-1 replication to an extent that correlated with steady-state levels of CypA. Finally, virions from PPIA(-/-) cells possessed no obvious biochemical abnormalities but were less infectious than virions from wild-type cells. These data formally demonstrate that CypA regulates the infectivity of HIV-1 virions."

In 2001 we undertook a descriptive study among a population of PLHIV treated in an ambulatory center in order to 1(o)) describe the socio-demographical characteristics of PLHIV admitted to the center and 2(o)) identify the strategies adopted by PLHIV and their families to control the risk of HIV transmission in the entourage. Patients were systematically included over a period of two weeks. Each patient was asked to indicate the name of a family member that could be interviewed by the research team. A total of 188 PLHIV (122 women) ranging in age from 19 to 55 years were questioned. Interviews were conducted in 66 families. Most PLHIV had received some formal education ranging from primary school to university. Over one third (36.4%) had known that they were seropositive for at least one year. Almost three-fourths (73.4%) were aware that HIV was transmissible to other people. The most frequently mentioned transmission hazards were handling contaminated articles (51.5%), unprotected sexual intercourse (46.4%), contact with blood (34.8%), and sharing personal toilet articles (11.6%). The most commonly mentioned preventive measures were abstinence from sex (27.1%), use condoms (28.7%), and protection from pointed or cutting objects (19.1%). According to responding family members, the most common protective measures against HIV transmission were observing hygiene measures (36.5%), discarding any fluids from the ill person in the toilet (26.5%), wearing gloves (25%), and protecting against handling contaminated objects (5.8%). These data suggest that programs aimed at educating PLHIV and their families on the risk of HIV transmission and preventive measure has had a positive impact on the quality of life."

7321,0.005,1.0000,"To test the hypothesis that the lung represents a source of interleukin (IL)-6 in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-positive subjects, alveolar macrophages (AM) obtained from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of 10 HIV-1-positive patients were investigated for the expression of IL-6 mRNA and the ability to release IL-6. The presence of IL-6 in BAL fluid was also investigated. It has been demonstrated that freshly recovered AM from HIV-1-positive patients show a strong IL-6 mRNA signal. The message for IL-6 increases following culture with LPS. Supernatants obtained from AM cultured in medium alone contain high amounts of IL-6; the values are three to four times higher following culture with LPS. IL-6 has also been detected in the BAL fluid from 5 of 8 HIV-1-positive patients. Results of immunoblotting analysis were consistent with those given above. These findings suggest that the lung represents a source of IL-6 production in HIV-1-infected subjects with lung disorders."
12318,0.005,1.0000,"We report the case of an adult patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) presenting with acute dyspnoea and cutaneous disseminated lesions suggestive of an atypical varicella. The chest radiograph and the computed tomography (CT)-scan revealed a miliary pneumonia. On a previous serum sample varicella-zoster (VZV)-specific serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G titre was 1/200. A high dose acyclovir treatment was effective, but recurrences occurred twice when the treatment was discontinued. During the first recurrence the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected the presence of VZV in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of secondary varicella with pulmonary involvement. Secondary varicella pneumonia has not been reported in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adult until now. The use of PCR on a BAL sample was very useful in this case because viral culture remained negative. Recurrences of the varicella pneumonia suggested that a maintenance treatment was required in this deeply immunocompromised patient."
17303,0.005,1.0000,"HIV disease progression and the effect of replacement therapy with clotting factor concentrates (CFCs) were studied in 100 Swedish haemophiliacs, mean age at seroconversion 29 years (range, 4-72). On average 16 years after seroconversion, 67 per cent of the patients had CD4+ cell counts of < 200 x 10(6)/l, 50 per cent had developed AIDS, and 58 per cent had died. HIV disease progression was significantly slower in those aged less than 28 (median age) at seroconversion (P = 0.004). Moreover, mortality was inversely correlated to total annual CFC consumption after adjustment for age and HIV-related therapy, i.e., Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis and antiretroviral drugs (P = 0.014), but unrelated to the purity of the CFCs used. After adjustment for age, annual CFC consumption and HIV-therapy, prophylactic replacement therapy was not associated with significantly better survival than on-demand treatment. It is concluded that in HIV-positive haemophiliacs replacement therapy may have a beneficial effect on the immune system, and that CFC purity and the regimen (prophylaxis vs on-demand) would seem to be factors of minor importance."
9557,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of the present study was to identify variables relevant to psychological well-being in HIV patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Multiple stressors accompany living with HIV while managing a HAART regimen. However, a variety of cognitive and behavioral variables can protect against or augment the deleterious effects of stress in this population. The authors hypothesized that satisfaction with social support, coping styles, and maladaptive attributions about HIV would explain more variance in psychological well-being than stressful life events per se. Participants were individuals with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy-either starting a new HAART regimen or having difficulties adhering to their current regimen. Satisfaction with social support, coping styles, and punishment beliefs about HIV were uniquely associated with depression, quality of life, and self-esteem over and above the effects of stressful life events. These results provide support for continued psychosocial interventions that target these variables among patients with HIV."

A clinic-based sample of 2032 YLWH (mean age 20.3 years), recruited from 20 adolescent medicine HIV clinics, completed a cross-sectional survey of health behaviors and psychological symptoms using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Overall, 17.5% of youth reported psychological symptoms greater than the normative threshold on the Global Severity Index. A wide variety of symptoms were reported. The prevalence of clinical symptoms was significantly greater in youth with behaviorally acquired HIV compared to those with perinatally acquired infection (20.6% vs. 10.8%, OR=2.06 in Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR)), and in those not taking ART that had been prescribed (29. 2% vs. 18.8%, OR=1.68 in MLR). Knowing one's HIV status for more than one year and disclosure of HIV status were not associated with fewer symptoms. A large proportion of YLWH have psychological symptoms and the prevalence is greatest among those with behaviorally acquired infection. The high rate of psychological symptoms for youth not taking ART that is prescribed is a cause for concern. Symptoms do not appear to be a transient reaction to diagnosis of HIV."

To the best of our knowledge, severe recurrent rhabdomyolysis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in a HIV-infected patient on two different triple antiretroviral regimens has not been reported. We present a HIV-positive patient who first developed heme pigment-induced oliguric AKI due to non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis, 5 days after initiation of triple antiretroviral therapy. Renal function normalized 2 months after discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy. Two weeks after reinitiating a different HAART regimen, our patient developed a recurrent episode of severe rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI. Both rhabdomyolysis and AKI resolved after discontinuation of the second antiretroviral regimen. First tenofovir and subsequently abacavir seem to be the likely culprits in our case. We also briefly discuss tenofovir nephrotoxicity followed by a literature review on rhabdomyolysis in HIV-infected patients."
18054,0.005,1.0000,"It was suspected that feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection would affect the function of feline macrophages, and that the concomitant infection of cats with FIV and Toxoplasma gondii would cause even greater changes in macrophage function. Sixteen specific-pathogen-free kittens, four per group, were infected either with FIV, T. gondii, both pathogens, or neither pathogen. After the cats had been infected with FIV for 14 weeks (8 weeks after T. gondii infection), peritoneal macrophages were collected. Some macrophages were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and supernatants were collected for the measurement of interleukin-1 production. Other macrophages were infected with T. gondii in a microbiocidal assay. Peritoneal macrophages from cats infected with FIV had decreased interleukin-1 secretion and increased antimicrobial activity. Co-infection with T. gondii apparently had no effect on these modifications of macrophage activity. Thus, acute FIV infection alone caused significant changes in macrophage functions that were not affected by concomitant T. gondii infection."

The clinical characteristics of 143 HIV-1-infected patients were measured, and patients were split into 2 groups: AIDS progression and AIDS non-progression. Genotyping of ZNRD1 and RNF39 was performed in all participants. We found that patients in the AIDS progression group had higher HIV-1 viral loads and lower CD4 cell counts than did patients in the AIDS non-progression group. The frequency of the AA genotype of ZNRD1 (rs16896970) was lower in the AIDS progression group than in the AIDS non-progression group. Patients with AA genotypes had lower levels of HIV-1 viral loads and higher levels of CD4 cell counts than did patients with AG+GG genotypes. AIDS progression in patients with the AA group is significantly different from that in patients with the AG and GG groups by using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The hazard ratio for progression was lower in the AA group than in the AG and GG groups. We identified a SNP that contributes to AIDS progression in HIV-1-infected patients in this population. This SNP had a significant protective influence on AIDS progression, and polymorphisms of the ZNRD1 gene may play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. "
2407,0.005,1.0000,"MHC class I polypeptide-related chain A (MICA), mapping to 6p21.33, belongs to the non-classical class I family and its expression is induced by several stress factors including viral infection. A recent genome-wide association study has identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of MICA, rs2596542 to be significantly associated with hepatitis C-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a Japanese population. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether the SNP rs2596542 plays any role in hepatitis B virus (HBV) sero-clearance or in the development of complications associated with chronic HBV such as cirrhosis and/or HCC. TaqMan genotyping assay was used to identify the association of the SNP among 584 normal healthy controls and 777 HBV-infected patients. The patient group was further categorized into inactive carriers (Group I), active carriers (Group II), cirrhosis (Group III) and cirrhosis-HCC (Group IV). Variation at this SNP was found to be significantly more frequent in control subjects than in patients (OR = 0.852; 95% C.I. = 0.730-0.994; p = 0.0415). Also, the SNP was found to have a highly significant association when the inactive carriers were compared to the rest of the patients (OR = 1.308; 95% C.I. = 1.058-1.617; p = 0.0130). The TT genotype was found to occur more frequently among active HBV carriers (groups II, III and IV) when compared to inactive HBV carriers, thus suggesting that the rs2596542-T may be recessively associated with an active HBV infection. However, no significant association was observed in the case of HBV-related cirrhosis or HCC. These findings indicate that the MICA rs2596542 has a significant role in HBV infection."
3479,0.005,1.0000,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have become important in predicting treatment response to interferon containing anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy in HCV and HIV/HCV-infected patients. A reliable method for extracting host DNA from serum for genotyping assays would present a practical alternative for clinicians and investigators seeking to perform SNP analyses in HCV-infected patients, particularly in resource-limited settings. Human genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum of 51 HIV/HCV coinfected patients using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit and QIAamp Min Elute Virus Spin Kit, respectively. Genotyping assays for the IL28B SNP (rs12979860) and SOCS3 SNP (rs4969170) were performed using the commercially available ABI Taqman allelic discrimination kit and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using 50 cycles. Results of the genotyping assays using DNA from both PBMCs and cell-free serum were determined separately and then analyzed for concurrence. Genotype analyses performed using DNA isolated from PBMCs or cell-free serum showed a 100% agreement between the IL28B genotyping results from the serum and PBMC isolates and 98% agreement for SOCS3 SNP. This novel serum-based assay to isolate DNA fragments from the serum of HIV/HCV-coinfected subjects can accurately determine a subject's genotype for IL28B (rs12979860) and SOCS3 (rs4969170). This assay could be immediately valuable for detecting clinically relevant SNPs from serum in cases in which PBMCs are not available."

However, little is known about the role of miRNA-323b in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-host interaction. We explored whether single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of miRNA-323b affects HBV replication in a Korean HBV cohort. Genotyping was performed in a total of 1439 subjects composed of 404 spontaneously recovered (SR) subjects as normal controls and 1035 chronic carriers (CC) of HBV who were further classified into 313 patients with chronic hepatitis, 305 patients with liver cirrhosis and 417 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. To confirm the effect of SNP of miRNA-323b on HBV replication in vitro, HepAD38 cells were transfected with miRNA-323b wild type or miRNA-323b SNP plasmid vectors, and HBV replication was induced for 5 days. HBV DNA was isolated and quantified using real-time PCR. The polymorphism rs56103835C>T in the pre-miRNA region of miRNA-323b revealed significant minor allele frequency (0.273). rs56103835C>T SNP showed significantly affect persistence of HBV in CC group compared with SR group (OR = 1.29, P = 0.009 in a codominant model; OR = 1.29, P = 0.03 in a dominant model; and OR = 1.78, P = 0.03 in a recessive model). In vitro, the total intracellular HBV DNA content was significantly reduced by miRNA-323b wild-type plasmid vector transfection (P = 0.014). The polymorphism of miRNA-323b was significantly associated with persistence of HBV by the enhancement of HBV replication (P = 0.021). Our findings provide a novel perspective on the role SNP of miRNAs in host-virus interactions in HBV infection. "

The effect of p53 codon 72 polymorphism Arg72Pro on HCC risk remains inconsistent. This study evaluated the association of MDM2 and p53 polymorphisms with the presence and early onset of HCC in Korean patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In total, 583 consecutive patients with chronic HBV infection were classified according to the presence (n = 287) or absence (n = 296) of HCC. The MDM2 SNP 309 and p53 Arg72Pro were genotyped using restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The MDM2 G/G and p53 Pro/Pro genotypes were more frequent in HCC group than in non-HCC group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). Multivariate analysis for the presence of HCC revealed that the odds ratio (OR) for MDM2 G/G over T/T was 4.89 (P < 0.001) and that of p53 Pro/Pro over Arg/Arg was 3.03 (P = 0.006). Combined MDM2 G/G and p53 Pro/Pro had a synergistic effect on HCC risk, with an OR of 20.78 (P < 0.001). The mean age of tumor onset in patients with MDM2 G/G genotype was 50.9 years compared with 55.1 with T/T genotype (P = 0.018) and that with p53 Pro/Pro was 49.7 years compared with 52.9 with Arg/Arg (P = 0.040). Thus, MDM2 SNP 309 and p53 Arg72Pro are associated with the early development of HCC in Korean patients with chronic HBV infection."

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CXCL12 gene (SDF1-3'A) has been associated with disease progression to AIDS in some studies, but not others. Mutations in the CXCR4 gene are generally rare and have not been implicated in HIV-1/AIDS pathogenesis. This study analyzed the SDF1-3'A SNP and performed mutation screening for polymorphic markers in the CXCR4 gene to determine the presence or absence of significant associations with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. The study consisted of 257 HIV-1-seropositive patients and 113 HIV-1-seronegative controls representing a sub-Saharan African population belonging to the Xhosa ethnic group of South Africa. The SDF1-3'A SNP was associated with an increased risk for HIV-1 infection (P = 0.0319) whereas no significant association was observed between the occurrence of the SDF1-3'A SNP and increased or decreased plasma levels of CXCL12. Comprehensive mutation analysis of the CXCR4 gene confirmed a high degree of genetic conservation within the coding region of this ancient population."

The survey response rate was 72.4 per cent. In patients with acute valvular insufficiency or with continuing angina despite maximal medical therapy (unstable angina) who were HIV-1 antibody positive, 75.8 and 80.8 per cent, respectively, of surgeons would operate. If the patient had end-stage infection, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), 29.7 per cent and 34.7 per cent, respectively, would consider surgical intervention. When asked to perform simple procedures such as open lung biopsy or pleurectomy on a patient with AIDS, more than half of surgeons would operate (52.2 and 65.6 per cent respectively). In patients with operable carcinoma of the lung and asymptomatic HIV-1 infection 52.3 per cent would operate. This fell to 15.0 per cent if the patient had a diagnosis of AIDS. The majority of surgeons (77.2 per cent) felt patients should have an HIV-1 antibody test before operation and this rose to 95.6 per cent if patients were in a high-risk group; 60.2 per cent of surgeons had changed their surgical practice to reduce the risks of blood-borne infection."

Alveolar opacification was seen in seven patients. Cavitation was rare (2 patients), as was ground-glass opacification (2 patients). Five patients had pleural effusions. No patient had mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Normal chest radiographs were seen in eight patients. Although the radiographic appearances of Pseudomonas bronchopulmonary infection in HIV-infected patients are non-specific, an interstitial infiltrate is a common finding.

It has also been predicted that by the end of the decade, HIVAN is likely to become a third leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in African-Americans between the ages of 20-64 years. As the morbidity and mortality from HIV-infection has decreased in the last few years, it is possible that prevalence of HIVAN is also changing. We therefore screened HIV-1-infected patients followed in our hospital for HIVAN. A screening urinalysis was performed in 557 HIV-1-infected adult patients between March and May 1998. Of these, 252 were outpatients and 305 were Texas Department of Criminal Justice inmates (TDCJI). Demographic and laboratory data of these patients was obtained from the HIV patients' database. Fifty percent of the patients were African-American, 36.6% were Caucasian and 12. 7% were Hispanic. The mean age of patients was 37 +/- 8 years. Seventy-nine percent of the patients were males and a history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) was present in 28%. Twenty-three percent of the patients were concomitantly infected with hepatitis C virus, 4.1% were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, and rapid plasma reagin test for syphilis was positive in 9.1%. In 38 patients who had more than 100 mg/dl (2+) proteins on screening urinalysis, total urinary proteins were quantitated by collecting 24 h urine specimens. Fifteen of these patients had urinary proteins more than 1.5 g/day (12 patients >3.5 g/24 h and 3 patients >1.5 g/24 h). A renal biopsy was done in 14 of these patients and clinical diagnosis of HIVAN was made in one patient who refused biopsy. Renal biopsies revealed HIVAN [9], diabetic nephropathy [2], membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis [2], Fibrillary glomerulonephritis [1]. All 10 patients (5 TDCJI and 5 outpatients) with HIVAN were African-American. Two of these 10 patients had a history of IVDA and another two were concomitantly infected with hepatitis C virus. The plasma viral load (Pvl) and total CD4 count was not different in patients with or without HIVAN [(Pvl log 10.05 +/- 1.39 vs. 9.9 +/- 2.18 copies/ml, p = 0.78) (CD4: 187 +/- 192 vs. 288 +/- 249 cells/microl, p = 1.17) mean +/- SD].

The peptide remained within the cervicovaginal tissues throughout the 9-day incubation period without altering tissue viability, inducing damage or inducing the release of inflammatory cytokines.

This means a reduction of the viral load and restitution of the CD4 cell count. A decreased rate of HIV replication improves both the number and function of CD4 cells. Nevertheless, this treatment sometimes results in the reappearance of previous symptoms from treated conditions due to opportunistic infections (ie: tuberculosis, criptococcosis, hepatitis, Pneumocystis jirovesi, toxoplasmosis, etc) or non infectious condition such as sarcoidosis, Graves disease or Kaposi sarcoma. This is known as Inflammatory Reconstitution Immune Syndrome (IRIS). We report a 37 year-old woman in stage C3-AIDS with a previous criptococcal meningitis. She was treated, achieving a marked improvement with treatment and subsequent suppressive therapy with fluconazole 200 mg/day. IRIS appeared after 8 months of ongoing antiretroviral therapy with immune restoration with the development of aseptic meningitis and intracranial hypertension. The opportunistic agent could not be identified by cultures. Additional laboratory tests excluded toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, bacterial cerebral abscesses, syphilitic cerebral gummas, and lymphoma. Brain CT and magnetic resonance studies were compatible with brain vasculitis and leptomeningitis. The patient condition improved with general measures, such as a repeated lumbar punctures and non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

It is one of the important causes of chronic pain and disability. Some of the drugs used for the treatment have immunosupressive activity. One of the serious side-effects of immunosupressive treatment is activation of opportunistic pathogens. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of these pathogens, and the rate of carriers in the population is considerably high. It can cause liver damage and death if reactivated. Thus, the management of oppotunistic pathogens becomes a complex issue when treating rheumatic diseases with immunosupressive drugs. In this case report, we present a juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patient whose liver enzymes raised while he was under treatment and afterwards HBV reactivation was determined as the cause. When reactivation was detected, we started controlled antiviral therapy. We achieved successful clinical and laboratory results after adding biological agents to the treatment. Careful evaluation of the patients who have indication for immunosuppressive agents and regular follow-up in case of infection may be protective from severe morbidity and/or mortality."

The aim of the current study was to investigate whether serum sCD163 levels correlate with liver inflammation and fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In a retrospective cohort study, serum sCD163 levels were assessed by ELISA together with clinical and laboratory data in 186 patients with chronic HBV infection and 15 healthy controls. The relation between parameters for liver fibrosis and necroinflammation and sCD163 levels was analysed. Additionally, sCD163 was quantified in a subset of follow-up serum samples after initiation of antiviral treatment. sCD163 levels differed among phases of chronic HBV infection (P < 0.0001), and sCD163 concentrations were associated with inflammatory activity and fibrosis in the liver. sCD163 levels ≥ 1961 ng/l had a high specificity in the identification of subjects with substantial fibrosis (F ≥ 2). sCD163 concentrations decreased significantly after initiation of antiviral treatment. The correlation of sCD163 levels with necroinflammation and fibrosis and the sCD163 decline under treatment indicates that macrophage activation plays a role in HBV-related liver pathogenesis."

E913 potently inhibited the replication of laboratory and primary R5 HIV-1 strains as well as various multidrug-resistant monocyte/macrophage tropic (R5) HIV-1 at IC(50) values of 0.03 to 0.06 microm. E913 was inactive against T cell tropic (X4) HIV-1; however, when combined with a CXCR4 antagonist AMD-3100, E913 potently and synergistically inhibited the replication of dualtropic HIV-1 and a 50:50 mixture of R5 and X4 HIV-1. Antagonism in anti-HIV-1 activity was not seen when E913 was combined with the reverse transcriptase inhibitor zidovudine or protease inhibitors. E913 proved to compete with the binding of antibodies to CCR5 which recognize the C-terminal half of the second extracellular loop (ECL2B) of CCR5.

The neurological manifestations of HIV infection noted in Indian patients is different from those reported in Western countries. Moreover, few studies have investigated the role of virological and immunological parameters with respect to the progression of HIV-1 clade C infection in India. In this study, we measured virological (HIV-1 RNA levels) and immunological parameters (CD4 cell count and inflammatory markers) in the plasma and CSF of HIV-1-infected neurologically asymptomatic and symptomatic (with opportunistic infections and/or dementia) subjects. By using clade-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we ascertained that all samples used for the study were infected with HIV-1 clade C. Among the various laboratory parameters evaluated, high viral loads in the CSF, low CD4 counts, and higher levels of interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), beta(2)-microglobulin, and neopterin were noted in HIV-infected subjects with neurological disease as compared to asymptomatic subjects.

From June to December 1993, serum samples were collected from 47 IVDU and 98 alcoholics in Hiroshima, Japan, and examined for markers of virus infection. The prevalence of antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) and/or HCV-RNA was significantly higher in IVDU than alcoholics (74.5% vs 20.4%, 44.7% vs 10.2% respectively, P < 0.001). In contrast, the prevalence of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen and/or core antigen (anti-HBs and/or anti-HBc) showed no significant difference between the 2 groups (57.4% vs 66.3%). HIV-1 infection was found in one (2.1%) IVDU and genome analysis indicated that it was subtype B according to Myers' classification.

In this multicenter, retrospective, longitudinal study, CD4 restoration was assessed according to HCV status in treatment-naive HIV-infected patients within 3 years of HAART. Only patients with persistent HIV suppression were included. Factors predicting CD4 gains were analyzed with multivariate linear regression. Out of 322 patients included 139 had positive HCV-RNA and 183 were only HIV infected. HCV-HIV-coinfected patients were older, more often ex-intravenous drug users (IVDU), and had less advanced HIV infection. Baseline CD4 count [OR -0.21 [95% CI (-0.34)-(-0.04)]; p = 0.01] and male sex [OR -0.19 [95% CI (-191.12)-(-10.87)]; p = 0.03] predicted smaller increments in absolute CD4 counts, and higher baseline CD4% [OR -0.38 [95% CI (-0.39)-(-0.21)]; p < 0.0001] and older age [OR -0.12 [95% CI (-0.23)-(-0.01)]; p = 0.03] predicted smaller gains in CD4% after 3 years of HAART.

Use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-only regimens and of zidovudine as part of the NRTI backbone was associated with smaller and greater gains in CD4%, respectively. HCV replication per se does not impair the CD4 restoration in HIV-infected patients successfully treated with antiretroviral therapy. Lower baseline CD4 counts are the strongest predictors of greater CD4 gains over a 3-year period, while a history of IVDU negatively affects CD4 restoration only early after the initiation of HAART."

In this study, we have investigated whether the fusion-inhibitor enfuvirtide (ENF) can induce mutations in Rev and if these mutations correlate with the classical ENF resistance gp41 mutations and with viremia and CD4 cell count. Specific Rev mutations were positively associated with ENF treatment and significantly correlated with classical ENF resistance gp41 mutations. In particular, a cluster was observed for the Rev mutations E57A (E57A(rev)) and N86S(rev) with the ENF resistance gp41 mutations Q40H (Q40H(gp41)) and L45M(gp41). In addition, the presence at week 48 of the E57A(rev) correlates with a significant viremia increase from baseline to week 48 and with a CD4 cell count loss from baseline to week 48. By modeling the RRE structure, we found that the Q40(gp41) and L45(gp41) codons form complementary base pairs in a region of the RRE involved in Rev binding. The conformation of this Rev-binding site is disrupted when Q40H(gp41) and L45M(gp41) occur alone while it is restored when both mutations are present. In conclusion, our study shows that ENF pressure may also affect both Rev and RRE structures and can provide an excellent example of compensatory evolution. This highlights the multiple roles of ENF (and perhaps other entry inhibitors) in modulating the correct interplay between the different HIV-1 genes and proteins during the HIV-1 life cycle."
3432,0.005,1.0000,"An increase in morbidity associated with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS patients has been described in Africa and the Mediterranean. Despite the high endemicity of VL and HIV-1/AIDS in Brazil, this association has not been thoroughly investigated. Our aim was to evaluate the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of VL-HIV-1/AIDS cases from Central-west [Mato Grosso do Sul (MS)] Brazil. Medical records of 23 VL-HIV-1/AIDS patients were reviewed. Patients were predominantly adult males (87%) and 34.8% of the patients were intravenous drug users (IVDU). Leishmaniasis was the first opportunistic infection in 60% of the HIV-1 patients. Fever occurred in all patients, although splenomegaly and hepatomegaly were absent in 21.7% of the cases. CD4+ T-cell counts were below 200 cells/mm(3) in 80% of the cases and the counts did not increase after clinical remission despite antiretroviral therapy. The first drug chosen to treat the cases was antimonial, but the therapeutic regimen was altered to amphotericin B in 12 of 17 cases due to side effects. Relapses were reported in 56.5% of the patients. IVDU may constitute an important risk factor for the transmission of both diseases in MS. VL-HIV-1/AIDS patients in MS share similar clinical characteristics as those from other endemic regions worldwide. Thus, these findings are critical for improving the surveillance of VL-HIV/AIDS patients."
1386,0.005,1.0000,"As part of an effort towards optimization of dosing of zidovudine (ZDV), formation and elimination of total phosphorylated ZDV (ZDVPt) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were examined in 21 asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients during their first 24 weeks of therapy (AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 161). Intracellular concentrations of ZDVPt were measured with a previously described and validated radioimmunoassay technique. Although ZDV phosphorylation occurred readily upon initiation of therapy, it declined with time; the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) at week 4 (mean +/- standard deviation, 3.41 +/- 0.93 pmol.h/10(6) cells) was significantly greater than that at week 24 (2.19 +/- 1.10 pmol.h/10(6) cells). Plasma ZDV AUC did not change with time and did not correlate with ZDVPt AUC. In dose-response experiments (20 to 100 mg orally), phosphorylation did not proportionally increase with increasing plasma ZDV concentrations. Similarly, compared with a single dose, two doses of ZDV over an 8-h period resulted in little ZDVPt increase in cells relative to increase in plasma ZDV concentrations. The half-life of intracellular ZDVPt was twice that of plasma ZDV (4 versus 2 h), suggesting that an every-8-h dosing regimen is justifiable. These findings suggest that metabolism of ZDV to its active intracellular forms may be saturable in some patients, is poorly correlated with plasma concentrations, and diminishes over time. These findings have implications for future development and management of anti-human immunodeficiency virus nucleoside therapy."

At present, 59 patients have begun receiving the trial regimen. Characteristics of patients at baseline were as follows: 46 men/13 women, CDC stage A, 75%; mean CD4 cell count, 429 cells/mm3; mean HIV RNA, 4.6 log10 copies/ml). Mean decrease of viral load was -1.9 log10 at week 4 (n = 39), -1.9 log10 at week 16 (n = 20), with HIV RNA below the detectable level (< 500 copies/ml) in 62% of patients at week 4 and 85% at week 16. Mean CD4 cell count increase was +118 cells/mm3 at week 4. Cutaneous intolerance occurred within the first 4 weeks in 11/59 (19%) patients after a mean of 14 days (range, 3-24 days) and led to nevirapine discontinuation in 3/11 patients. Preliminary results of this ongoing trial show that combination therapy with stavudine/didanosine/nevirapine is a convenient (seven pills in two daily intakes) triple-therapy regimen with rapid immunological and antiviral effects. Rash, frequent in the first weeks of therapy, usually can be managed without stopping nevirapine. Long-term suppression of plasma HIV RNA with this combination needs to be confirmed but may support use of nevirapine as a component of first-line anti-HIV therapy along with two nucleosides."
2665,0.005,1.0000,"9-(2-Phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro in human T-lymphocyte MT-4, H9, and ATH8 cells. PMEA also inhibits Moloney murine sarcoma virus (Mo-MSV)-induced transformation of murine C3H embryo fibroblasts. Moreover, PMEA causes a dose-dependent suppression of tumor formation and associated mortality in mice inoculated with Mo-MSV. At a dose of 50 or 20 mg/kg per day PMEA effected a 90-100% protection of the mice against Mo-MSV-induced tumor formation and mortality. Even with a PMEA dose as low as 1 to 5 mg/kg per day, tumor formation was significantly delayed and the survival rate was significantly enhanced. In parallel experiments, azidothymidine exhibited a comparable inhibitory effect on Mo-MSV-induced tumor formation and associated death only at a 25-fold higher dose than PMEA. Because PMEA has stronger in vivo antiretrovirus potency and selectivity than azidothymidine and various other compounds currently being subjected to clinical trials, PMEA studies should be pursued to assess the potential of this compound in the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other retrovirus infections in humans."
5644,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been linked to the development of glomerular disease. HCV infection is highly prevalent among intravenous drug users, a population that is also at risk for HIV coinfection. This study reports the clinical-pathologic features and outcome of HCV-associated glomerular disease (HCV-GD) in 14 patients with HIV coinfection. All were intravenous drug users and all but one were African-Americans. Renal presentations included renal insufficiency, microscopic hematuria with active urine sediment, hypertension, and nephrotic syndrome or nephrotic-range proteinuria without hypercholesterolemia. Hypocomplementemia and cryoglobulinemia were present in 46 and 33% of patients, respectively. The predominant renal biopsy findings were membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type 1 or type 3 (Burkholder subtype) in 79% of patients and membranous glomerulopathy with atypical features in 21% (including overlap with collapsing glomerulopathy in one patient). The clinical course was characterized by rapid progression to renal failure requiring dialysis. The overall morbidity and mortality were high with median time of 5.8 mo to dialysis or death. Although most patients died in renal failure, cause of death was primarily attributable to long-term immunosuppression and advanced AIDS. Patients with AIDS had shorter survival than those without (median survival time of 6.1 mo versus 45.9 mo, log-rank test P = 0.02). Only two patients were alive with stable renal function at follow-up of 28.5 mo. In patients with HCV-GD, coinfection with HIV leads to an aggressive form of renal disease that can be easily confused with HIV-associated nephropathy. Although hypocomplementemia, cryoglobulinemia, and more prominent hypertension and microscopic hematuria may provide clues to the presence of HCV-GD, renal biopsy is essential to differentiate HCV-GD from HIV-associated nephropathy."
18254,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is one of the most common infectious etiologies of acute hepatitis worldwide. The virus is known to be transmitted fecal-orally, resulting in symptoms ranging from asymptomatic infection to fulminant hepatitis. HAV can also be transmitted through oral-anal sex. Residents from regions of low endemicity for HAV infection often remain susceptible in their adulthood. Therefore, clustered HAV infections or outbreaks of acute hepatitis A among men who have sex with men and injecting drug users have been reported in countries of low endemicity for HAV infection. The duration of HAV viremia and stool shedding of HAV may be longer in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals compared to HIV-negative individuals with acute hepatitis A. Current guidelines recommend HAV vaccination for individuals with increased risks of exposure to HAV (such as from injecting drug use, oral-anal sex, travel to or residence in endemic areas, frequent clotting factor or blood transfusions) or with increased risks of fulminant disease (such as those with chronic hepatitis). The seroconversion rates following the recommended standard adult dosing schedule (2 doses of HAVRIX 1440 U or VAQTA 50 U administered 6-12 mo apart) are lower among HIV-positive individuals compared to HIV-negative individuals. While the response rates may be augmented by adding a booster dose at week 4 sandwiched between the first dose and the 6-mo dose, the need of booster vaccination remain less clear among HIV-positive individuals who have lost anti-HAV antibodies."

The structure-activity relationship revealed that compounds with the combination of hydrophilic P3 and beta-branched hydrophobic P2 amino acids generally showed strong inhibitory activity against HIV-1 PR. In particular, compounds 4 (Boc-Orn-Val-Cha-psi [H.E.]-Ala-NHBun; Bu(n) = n-butyl, Ki = 11 nM) and 6 (Z-Orn-Val-Cha-psi [H.E.]-Ala-NHBun, Ki = 8 nM) exhibited good enzyme selectivity, possessing no significant inhibitory activities toward closely related aspartic proteases, pepsin, cathepsin D, and renin. As a possible model system for (anti-Mo-MSV/MLV complex (Mo-MSV = Moloney murine sarcoma virus; MLV = murine leukemia virus)) activity was investigated. Both compounds were found to inhibit moderately the focus formation of Mo-MSV/MLV complex in NIH3T3 cells (compound 4, IC50 = 1.8 microM; compound 6, IC50 = 1.0 microM)."
11119,0.005,1.0000,"Development of HCV infection is typically followed by chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in most patients, while spontaneous HCV viral clearance (SVC) occurs in only a minority of subjects. Compared with the widespread application of HCV RNA testing by quantitative RT-PCR technique, HCV core antigen detection may be an alternative indicator in the diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infections and in monitoring the status of infectious individuals. However, the correlation and differences between these two indicators in HCV infection need more investigation, especially in patients coinfected by HIV-1. In this study, a total of 354 anti-HCV and/or anti-HIV serum positive residents from a village of central China were enrolled. Besides HCV-related hepatopathic variables including clinical status, ALT, AST, anti-HCV Abs, as well as the altered CD4+/CD8+ T cell counts, HCV core antigen and HCV viral load were also measured. The concentration of serum HCV core antigen was highly correlated with level of HCV RNA in CHC patients with or without HIV-1 coinfection. Of note, HCV core antigen concentration was negatively correlated with CD4+ T cell count, while no correlation was found between HCV RNA level and CD4+ T cell count. Our findings suggested that quantitative detection of plasma HCV core antigen may be an alternative indicator of HCV RNA qPCR assay when evaluating the association between HCV replication and host immune status in HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients."
1735,0.005,1.0000,"N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) catalyzes protein N-myristoylation. It has been suggested that the isozyme NMT1 enhances the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). However, the details of the mechanism by which NMT1 does so remain unclear. In this study, we investigated NMT1-binding proteins by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. As a result, several RNA-binding proteins including ribosomal proteins, NMT isozymes, and hnRNP A2/B1 were observed to bind to NMT1, as mediated mainly by RNA. Interestingly, only hRNP A2/B1 was found to associate with NMT1 without mediation by RNA. It was also suggested that hnRNP A2/B1 contributes to the formation of complexes of high molecular weights involving NMT1. Knockdown of hnRNP A2/B1 resulted in the enhancement of viral replication with an increase in the expression level of viral RNA in HIV-1-producing cells. On the other hand, knockdown of NMT1 resulted in the attenuation of viral replication with the decrease in the expression level of viral RNA in HIV-1-producing cells. Additionally, overexpression of NMT1 induced the enhancement of viral replication with the increase in the expression level of the viral RNA. These findings suggest that both NMT1 and hnRNP A2/B1 take part in the regulation of HIV-1 RNA expression through their mutual opposite effects on the viral RNA expression in HIV-1-producing cells. "
5787,0.005,1.0000,"Cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus carrying the gag and pol regions of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 genome (Vac-gag/pol) released human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-like particles containing HIV-specific RNA. However, cells infected with another recombinant vaccinia, Vac-gag/pol-dP, derived through the deletion of an 85-base region (nucleotide positions 679-763) of the HIV genome between the primer binding site and the gag initiation codon of Vac-gag/pol, produced HIV-like particles devoid of the HIV-specific RNA. This 85-base deletion was suggested to cause the collapse of a stable stem-loop structure of 46 bases (751-796) around the gag initiation codon. To examine the role of the stem-loop structure in the packaging of RNAs, we constructed a vaccinia vector plasmid that carried this 46-base sequence followed by the Sendai virus nucleocapsid (NP) gene. When both Vac-gag/pol-dP and this plasmid were introduced into cells, HIV-like particles released from the cells contained the NP gene RNA. However, another vaccinia vector plasmid, which carried the 46-base sequence in the midst of the NP gene, could not supply RNA for incorporation into HIV-like particles. Computer analysis of this plasmid sequence suggested that the 46-base sequence cannot form the stem-loop structure. These findings suggest that the stem-loop structure formed by the 46-base sequence is crucial as a packaging signal."
3211,0.005,1.0000,"The temporal association between the increase in viral replication and the depletion in CD4+ T cells in HIV-1 infection is not yet clear. To investigate this phenomenon HIV-1 RNA was quantified in several frozen sera from 20 asymptomatic HIV-1 infected patients in the 2 years preceding CD4+ T cell depletion of 50% or more, and compared with 20 HIV-1 infected paired patients who were stable in the same period. In each group, no statistically significant variation in the mean HIV-1 RNA titre was found between the last checkup and the one 24 months earlier. The mean HIV-1 RNA titre was 10(3.86) copies/ml in the non-progressor group and 10(5.12) copies/ml in the progressor group. These data support the view that the quantity of circulating HIV-1 RNA is an early predictor of disease progression that is relatively constant during the asymptomatic period of HIV-1 infection."
12229,0.005,1.0000,"In multiply coinfected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, we investigated the effects of high-activity antiretroviral therapy (HAART) using HIV protease inhibitors on three other viruses: hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis G virus (HGV), and TT virus (TTV). Viral concentrations were measured serially by polymerase chain reaction methods in five patients with quadruple infection (HIV, HCV, HGV, and TTV) and in two patients with triple infection (HIV, HCV, and HGV) before and during HAART. In addition, CD4+ cell counts and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were measured serially. Generally we observed no difference in serum HCV RNA, HGV RNA, or TTV DNA concentrations between samples obtained before and after initiation of HAART, whereas HIV RNA concentration decreased and CD4 counts increased in most patients. However, two patients had markedly decreased concentrations of HCV RNA and HGV RNA, respectively, more than 12 months after beginning HAART. Normalization of serum ALT levels was observed in a patient with decline of HCV RNA concentrations. No interactions were observed among these four viruses. HAART had no apparent direct effects on HCV, HGV, or TTV. Further studies will be required to elucidate whether the restoration of immune status through suppression of HIV replication by HAART may affect HCV or HGV RNA concentrations."
3197,0.005,1.0000,"Due to the inconsistent effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the human male reproduction in previous studies and the impacts of environmental exposures, such as heavy metals, on male reproduction receiving little attention in HIV-infected population, the aim of present study was to investigate whether heavy metals have potential effects on reproductive parameters in HIV-infected men. The current study assessed the associations between semen quality or serum hormone and concentration of the three heavy metal toxicants (lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and zinc (Zn)) in seminal, urine, and serum, and 50 HIV-infected men were recruited in the present study. Concentrations of Pb, Cd, and Zn were measured in three fluids by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Semen analyses were performed according to World Health Organization criteria. Serum samples were analyzed for follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone. HIV RNA viral load was determined by HIV virus loads kit. Spearman's rank correlations were used for correlation analyses. The results showed that the concentrations of Pb, Cd, and Zn were significantly correlated with semen quality and serum hormone. HIV-1 virus loads were significantly associated with increased seminal Pb. However, HIV-1 virus loads were not statistically associated with semen quality and serum hormone. Our findings suggested that environmental heavy metals had potential effects on reproductive parameters in HIV-infected men in China."

Since his liver function became rapidly impaired, anti-HBV therapy with oral administration of entecavir (ETV) was started, and resulted in a favorable outcome. However, serum concentration of HIV-RNA decreased by log 1.26 within 60 days, which strongly suggested the inhibition of HIV proliferation by ETV. To prevent the appearance of mutated HIV, novel therapeutic strategies should be established in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients."
1127,0.005,1.0000,"The ability of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) to control and influence the outcome of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is not fully understood. The association between HIV-CTL activity and disease progression was evaluated prospectively in 36 HIV-1-infected individuals with a median follow-up of 3.0 years. HIV-CTL activity was measured in a 4 h Cr* release assay using autologous target cells expressing HIV-1 BRU isolate gene products (gp-120, gag, pol, nef) and a bulk culture of autologous effector cells. The CD4 count was measured at enrolment and plasma HIV RNA was measured retrospectively. The present study failed to support the hypothesis that HIV-CTL activity, as measured using the present method, is important in reducing the risk of death in HIV-infected individuals. However, using other approaches and methods could possibly yield other conclusions, and further prospective studies are needed to examine the relationship between CTL and disease progression."
10073,0.005,1.0000,"In addition to muscle changes due to peripheral nervous system involvement, primary myopathic changes associated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have also been described. We studied seven cases: two had developed an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), four had seroconverted to HIV but were otherwise asymptomatic, one was HIV seronegative when the biopsy was performed and one was biopsied twice. Besides the HIV no other infectious agent was detected. Muscle biopsies showed: (a) muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration; (b) inflammatory changes with moderate perivascular infiltration; and (c) unusual myofibrillary disorganization. Immunocytochemical techniques using anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies showed the presence of the virus in one biopsy. HIV-RNA was detected by in situ hybridization in the same biopsy. With both techniques the HIV was detected in isolated mononuclear cells in the muscle endomysium and not within the muscle fibers. Muscle involvement associated with HIV infection may be related, at least in some cases, to the presence of the virus in interstitial cells."
19896,0.005,1.0000,"Although skeletal muscle abnormalities have been described in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the effects of HIV infection on respiratory muscle function have not been well characterized. We hypothesized that HIV+ individuals may develop respiratory muscle weakness and that respiratory muscle dysfunction may contribute to the unexplained dyspnea that occurs in the setting of HIV. To test this hypothesis we studied maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), inspiratory muscle endurance, and respiratory symptoms in 23 HIV+ male outpatients who had no history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related pulmonary complications, with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 331.6 +/- 62.1 (mean +/- SEM). Respiratory muscle endurance was measured with an incremental threshold loading (ITL) protocol. We compared these results to those for 14 HIV- males matched for age and weight. Compared with the controls, HIV+ subjects had a significantly lower mean MIP (98.7 +/- 7.4 versus 121.4 +/- 9.3 cm H2O, p < 0.05) and MEP (115.0 +/- 9.3 versus 152.1 +/- 14.8 cm H2O, p < 0.05). Furthermore, during ITL, the mean load at task failure in the HIV+ group was 295.7 +/- 36.2 g, versus 405.8 +/- 52.2 g in the control group (p < 0.05). In the HIV+ subjects there was no relationship between muscle performance and CD4+ count or azidothymidine (AZT) use. There was, however, a highly significant relationship between respiratory muscle dysfunction and symptoms of dyspnea. We conclude that HIV seropositivity is associated with a decline in respiratory muscle performance. This impairment in respiratory muscle function may contribute to the feeling of breathlessness that has been well described in this patient population."
15958,0.005,1.0000,"Heart muscle disease in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), characterized by electrocardiographic changes or congestive cardiomyopathy, is a documented clinical problem, but its pathogenesis is obscure. In AIDS the heart is known to be involved by a variety of opportunistic infections as well as Kaposi's sarcoma, but no causative relation with the development of cardiomyopathy has been established. This study reports evidence for direct infection of the heart in AIDS, not by an opportunistic pathogen but by the AIDS, not by an opportunistic pathogen but by the AIDS virus itself, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For this study the technique of in situ deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization was applied to cardiac tissues obtained at autopsy from AIDS patients. Using sulfur-35-labeled ribonucleic acid probes encompassing the entire HIV genome, HIV nucleic acid sequences were detected in cardiac tissue sections from 6 of 22 patients examined who died of AIDS. The hybridization targets appeared to be cardiac myocytes, although their precise morphology was often obscured by the intensity of the signal. The myocardial cells showing a positive hybridization signal were sparse, often comprising only 1 or a few cells per section, and their number and location did not correlate obviously with any histopathologic or clinical evidence of heart muscle disease in these patients. It is conceivable that the presence of HIV nucleic acid sequences may represent a preclinical marker of impending AIDS-associated heart muscle disease. This sequela would not be recognized in many patients, including those in this series, who died rapidly of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Kaposi's sarcoma and other well-documented manifestations of AIDS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
1318,0.005,1.0000,"Zidovudine (ZDV), a nucleoside analogue which inhibits viral replication, is currently used in the treatment of type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. It has been considered to be the cause of an acquired form of myopathy associated with a depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in muscle fibres, although the fact that the patients previously studied were clearly symptomatic, and the theoretical difficulty in differentiating on HIV-related myopathy from the effects of ZDV, led to a controversy on the possible deleterious effect of ZDV on muscle fibres. We studied the muscle biopsy taken from 42 HIV-1 infected patients, regardless of their medical complaints, and two series of controls: 12 HIV-negative patients suffering from diverse neuromuscular diseases and 10 normal patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery. Whole DNA was extracted following standard procedures and analysed by means of Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We found that mtDNA was only depleted in HIV-1 infected patients treated with ZDV, but not in controls or patients untreated with this antiretroviral drug. Moreover, the depletion was more marked in patients who either presented weakness, myalgia, raised serum creatine kinase (CK), or ragged-red fibres. Mitochondrial DNA deletions were found in low proportion in all groups of patients, regardless of their HIV infection or ZDV status, but not in normal controls. We conclude that ZDV treatment in HIV-1 positive patients produces depletion of muscle mtDNA. The depletion can be demonstrated even in asymptotic patients, but is more marked in patients with clinical symptoms or abnormalities in their muscle biopsies. Other mtDNA abnormalities such as deletions seemed to be more related to other circumstances concurring in HIV-1 infected patients than to the effects of ZDV."
3889,0.005,1.0000,"We report the first case of inclusion body myositis (IBM) which occurred after interferon-alpha treatment for chronic hepatitis C. A 63-year-old man contracted hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) from a blood transfusion at age of 18. At age 57, he was treated with interferon-alpha (IFN alpha) for chronic hepatitis C. A month later, he developed muscle weakness in the proximal part of his lower extremities. IBM was diagnosed after a muscle biopsy at age 62. Steroid therapy improved his muscle power. One year later, worsening of his hepatic condition required re-administration of IFN alpha after gradual decrease and discontinuation of prednisolone. However, several days later, he rapidly became weaker and required a cane to walk. Elevated serum creatine kinase (2,199IU/L) and abnormal intensity in his MRI of thigh were demonstrated. The second muscle biopsy, performed after obtaining the informed consent from our patient, confirmed relapse of IBM. His symptoms improved again after discontinuation of IFN alpha and re-induction of prednisolone. Although a few cases each of IBM associated with HCV or HTLV-1 have been reported, the pathogenesis of virus-associated inflammatory myositis has not been clearly understood. Moreover, there has been no description on IBM associated with IFN alpha treatment, though several cases of polymyositis have been reported. Our case suggests that infection of HCV and HTLV-1 may be immunologically involved in the development of IBM and that IFN alpha can be directly related to onset and relapse of IBM."

One hundred and seventeen (24.4%) had evidence of previous infection, including nine (1.9%) carriers. The effect of potential risk factors on seropositivity was evaluated by multiple logistic regression analysis, which enabled assessment of the individual contribution of each risk factor under the specific environmental conditions. The following risk factors were found to influence seropositivity: origin from Third World countries as opposed to the Western World, employment as sanitary workers, age over 40 years, and history of accidental needle punctures. In the heterogeneous Israeli population, hospital workers had a relatively high prevalence of HBV markers, probably resulting from occupational exposure."
18766,0.005,1.0000,"It is known that antiretroviral drugs can induce immunologic improvement in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other manifestations of HIV infection. However, the improvements so attained are often partial and transient. This may result from a number of factors, including incomplete inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication by available agents, the development of viral drug resistance, the effect of cytokines, or thymic damage. An understanding of this problem may be important in further development of AIDS therapies. It will also be important to learn how to best assess the response to various therapies. In this regard, the CD4 count is evolving as a mortality risk indicator in AIDS and as such may find utility in assessing new therapeutic approaches. We have observed that in a cohort of gay men receiving antiretroviral therapy in a research environment, nearly all deaths occurred in individuals with fewer than 50 CD4 cells/mm3. However, the relationship between the CD4 count and the hazard of dying may be influenced by a number of factors (e.g., active intravenous drug use, extreme poverty, etc.), and further studies are needed to define the relationship between CD4 and clinical endpoints under a variety of conditions."
13089,0.005,1.0000,"The recent elucidation of the life cycle and dynamics of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and technological advances in development of the HIV RNA PCR assay for sensitive detection of viral load have revolutionized the diagnosis, management, and treatment of HIV infection. Beginning with initial infection, there is unremitting, high-level viral replication that persists throughout the course of HIV infection. The measure of the amount of virus present in plasma, HIV viral load, is the single most important predictor of HIV progression, the best indicator of immune system decline, and the best guide for initiating and monitoring antiviral treatment. Further, HIV viral load has become the new yardstick against which other markers, including CD4 number, age, chemokine receptor mutations, cytotoxic T-cell responses, and neutralizing antibody titers are assessed. For individuals with haemophilia, additional 'markers' may have significant impact on the outcome of HIV disease. Chronic factor concentrate treatment has led to transfusion-associated hepatitis, co-infection with hepatitis C (HCV), and chronic liver disease. The latter may become accelerated with HIV progression and may lead to hepatotoxicity with antiviral drug therapy. Chronic factor concentrate treatment has also been associated with immunosuppression, including both B- and T-cell immune defects. In HIV(+) haemophilic men, this immune deficit has led to lower CD4 counts with HIV progression and poorer CD4 response to antiviral drugs than in gay men. The underlying haemophilic bleeding tendency may result in significant haemorrhage with HIV-associated immune thrombocytopenia and with protease inhibitor antiretroviral therapy. Although AIDS is the leading cause of death in this group, the reduction in the size of the haemophilia population over the next two centuries is estimated to be small, and survival should improve as better antiviral therapeutics are identified."

The present retrospective cohort study assessed the antiviral efficacy of ETV/adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) combination therapy for ETV-resistant HBV with prior lamivudine (LAM) resistance, and either with or without previous ADV resistance. The cumulative probability of achieving a virological response (undetectable serum HBV DNA) was compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Breslow method. Seventeen patients with ETV-resistant HBV who were treated with ETV/ADV combination therapy for at least 6 months at a tertiary care center, were included; seven had dual resistance to ETV and LAM [ADV-r(-) group] and 10 had triple resistance to ETV, LAM, and ADV [ADV-r(+) group]. The median follow-up period was 9 months (range, 6-23). A virological response was noted in seven patients after a median of 3 months (range, 3-12) of treatment; five in the ADV-r(-) group and two in the ADV-r(+) group. The cumulative probability of a virological response was significantly higher in the ADV-r(-) group than in the ADV-r(+) group (6 months cumulative probability, 57.1% vs. 11.1%). In conclusion, ETV/ADV combination therapy led to virological responses in five of seven patients with resistance to ETV and LAM, but a significantly poorer response in patients with prior ADV resistance than in those without prior ADV resistance. Therefore, ETV/ADV combination therapy could be a useful therapeutic option for ETV- and LAM-resistant HBV without prior ADV resistance."
15788,0.005,1.0000,"Detection of hepadnaviral DNA in extrahepatic tissues of human and animal models of hepatitis B virus (HBV) has raised the question of whether virus replication in organs other than the liver could be targeted for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Since duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) replication is dynamic in the liver, kidney, pancreas, and spleen of newly hatched ducklings infected in ovo, we used the duck model and the new antiherpesvirus agent, famciclovir (FCV), to determine whether antiviral effect of nucleoside analogues on DHBV replication is pluripotential. Day-old ducklings hatched from eggs laid by a DHBV-carrier duck were bled and administered FCV (25 mg/kg/bd) orally for periods of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 days. Seventeen (17) hours after the last dose of each regimen the duckling(s) was bled and postmortem samples of liver, kidney, pancreas, and spleen were snap-frozen and stored at -70 degrees C. Analysis of plasma samples of ducklings treated for 2 days and longer by dot-blot hybridisation showed that levels of DHBV DNA were reduced significantly compared to levels in samples collected before treatment begun. Southern blot hybridisation of tissue DNA corroborated these results and showed that DHBV DNA replicative intermediates in all the tissues examined were reduced to levels that reflected the amount of virus released into the blood of each treated duckling. It is concluded from these results that if antiviral agents could be transformed to active metabolites in any infected tissues including the liver, replication of hepadnaviruses would be inhibited.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
313,0.005,1.0000,"Carcinoma of the breast is the most common malignancy in women in the United States. More than 40% of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection develop cancer during their illness, but breast cancer has seldom been reported. Twenty patients with breast cancer and HIV infection seen at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital between January 1988 and August 2000 were retrospectively analyzed. Seventeen patients had a previous or concurrent diagnosis of HIV at the time of the breast cancer diagnosis. Their CD4 count ranged from 13-1126/microL (median, 309/microL). Most patients were premenopausal (16 of 20), with ages ranging from 31-61 years (median, 44 years). All stages of breast cancer were seen: ductal carcinoma in situ (2 patients), stage I (1 patient), stage II (9 patients), stage III (6 patients), and stage IV (2 patients). Ten tumors had estrogen receptors. Four of the 13 patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection had abnormal lymph node findings, including 2 with follicular hyperplasia and 2 with caseating granulomas. Seven patients received chemotherapy with very poor tolerance. Estrogen receptor-positive patients were treated with tamoxifen. Of the 18 patients who presented with local disease, 7 have died: 2 of breast cancer, 4 of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and 1 of cardiac arrest. Nine patients remain free of disease (5 of them > 5 years) and 2 patients are alive with metastatic disease. Breast cancer in the HIV-positive population is similar to that seen in seronegative women. Most of the patients that are long-term survivors were treated with surgery and tamoxifen. The benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy are not clear."
14100,0.005,1.0000,"Non-adherence to safer sex and non-adherence to ART can each have adverse health consequences for HIV-infected individuals and their sex partners, but little is known about the association of these behaviors with each other. This ""dual risk"" has potential negative public health consequences since non-adherence can lead to the development of resistant virus that can then be transmitted to sex partners. Among participants in the Multi-site Adherence Collaboration in HIV we examined, at study baseline, the association between the frequency of unprotected sex (assessed by self-report) and ART adherence (assessed by Medication Event Monitoring System, Aardex) among the sexually active participants in the five studies (N = 459) that collected sexual risk behavior. The bivariate association between sexual risk behaviors and ART adherence was assessed by Pearson correlations; subsequently regression analyses were used to evaluate the role of demographic characteristics, depression and substance use in explaining the ""dual risk"" outcome (sexual risk and non-adherence). Among participants who had been sexually active, more unprotected anal/vaginal sex was weakly associated with poorer ART adherence (r = -0.12, p = 0.01 for the overall sample). Further analysis showed this association was driven by the heterosexual men in the sample (r = -0.29, p < 0.001), and was significant only for this group, and not for gay/bisexual men or for women (heterosexual and homosexual). Neither substance use nor depression accounted for the association between sexual risk and ART adherence. HIV-infected heterosexual men who are having difficulty adhering to ART are also more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors and therefore may benefit from counseling about these risk behaviors. We must identify procedures to screen for these risk behaviors and develop interventions, appropriately tailored to specific populations and identified risk factors, that can be integrated into routine clinical care for people living with HIV. This will become increasingly important in the context of wider access to treatment globally, including new recommendations for ART initiation earlier in a patients' disease course (e.g., ""Test and Treat"" paradigms)."
18505,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the clinical and radiographic features and the response to therapy of Mycobacterium kansasii infection in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, the clinical charts of 19 cases diagnosed during a 15-year period were reviewed retrospectively. Most patients were male intravenous drug abusers. Mycobacterium kansasii infection occurred late in the course of HIV disease and was associated with advanced immunosuppression. Thirteen patients had pulmonary disease, three extrapulmonary disease (2 with pulmonary involvement), and three pulmonary colonization. Most of them had fever and nonspecific respiratory symptoms; interstitial and alveolar infiltrates were the most common radiographic findings. Fourteen patients were given antituberculous treatment; among these, a clinical response was observed in 85%. Overall mortality was 63%, but only four patients died from active Mycobacterium kansasii disease. HIV infection has become the most important risk factor for Mycobacterium kansasii disease in our setting. Pulmonary infection is the most frequent form of disease and is usually responsive to antituberculous therapy."
11389,0.005,1.0000,"CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are strong mediators of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) control, yet HIV-1 frequently mutates to escape CTL recognition. In an analysis of sequences in the Los Alamos HIV-1 database, we show that emerging CTL escape mutations were more often present at lower frequencies than the amino acid(s) that they replaced. Furthermore, epitopes that underwent escape contained amino acid sites of high variability, whereas epitopes persisting at high frequencies lacked highly variable sites. We therefore infer that escape mutations are likely to be associated with weak functional constraints on the viral protein. This was supported by an extensive analysis of one subject for whom all escape mutations within defined CTL epitopes were studied and by an analysis of all reported escape mutations of defined CTL epitopes in the HIV Immunology Database. In one of these defined epitopes, escape mutations involving the substitution of amino acids with lower database frequencies occurred, and the epitope soon reverted back to the sensitive form. We further show that this escape mutation substantially diminished viral fitness in in vitro competition assays. Coincident with the reversion in vivo, we observed the fixation of a mutation 3 amino acids C terminal to the epitope, coincident with the ablation of the corresponding CTL response. The C-terminal mutation did not restore replication fitness reduced by the escape mutation in the epitope and by itself had little effect on replication fitness. Therefore, this C-terminal mutation presumably impaired the processing and presentation of the epitope. Finally, for one persistent epitope, CTL cross-reactivity to a mutant form may have suppressed the mutant to undetected levels, whereas for two other persistent epitopes, each of two mutants showed poor cross-reactivity and appeared in the subject at later time points. Thus, a viral dynamic exists between the advantage of immune escape, peptide cross-reactivity, and the disadvantage of lost replication fitness, with the balance playing an important role in determining whether a CTL epitope will persist or decline during infection."

We evaluated the efficacy of 96 weeks of entecavir therapy in patients with resistance to lamivudine/adefovir sequential therapy. In total, 33 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with evidence of active viral replication (HBV DNA levels ≥ 10(5) copies/mL) or a history of treatment failure to lamivudine/adefovir sequential therapy between April 2007 and July 2009 were treated with entecavir (1.0 mg daily) for at least 48 weeks. The rates of alanine transaminase (ALT) normalization and HBV DNA negativity were 66.7% (14/21) and 24.2% (8/33) at 48 weeks, respectively. The initial HBV DNA level was the only factor that was inversely associated with serum HBV DNA negativity after 48 weeks of entecavir therapy (P < 0.023). At 96 weeks, the rates of ALT normalization and HBV DNA negativity were 77.8% (7/9) and 16.7% (3/18), respectively. Viral breakthrough occurred in 21.2% (7/33) and 78.9% (15/19) of patients at 48 and 96 weeks, respectively. Patients who achieved a HBV DNA level of <4 log(10) copies/mL at 48 weeks maintained a similar HBV DNA level and a normal ALT level until 96 weeks. Entecavir monotherapy for 96 weeks was not efficacious for patients with lamivudine/adefovir-resistant HBV. The initial HBV DNA level was the only predictive factor for antiviral efficacy. However, patients who achieved a HBV DNA level of <4 log(10) copies/mL with a normal ALT level at 48 weeks should maintain, rather than stop, entecavir therapy."
277,0.005,1.0000,"Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare soft tissue infection associated with a high mortality rate. Several risk factors for the development of necrotizing fasciitis have been studied, which has given surgeons insight into the types of patients who are more likely to present with this rapidly progressive infection. The concomitant diagnosis of hepatitis C viral infection has not been reported in the literature previously. In this retrospective study covering a 12-year period in 1 Level I trauma center, 10 (34%) of 29 patients presenting with necrotizing fasciitis had an underlying diagnosis of hepatitis C viral infection. The mortality rate in patients with hepatitis C viral infection was 30% compared with 21% for those without hepatitis C viral infection (P=.59). The proportion of patients presenting with the concomitant diagnosis of hepatitis C viral infection and necrotizing fasciitis was statistically greater than that expected from the prevalence of hepatitis C viral infection in the general population (1.8%; P<.001).Our study showed that hepatitis C viral infection is a risk factor for developing necrotizing fasciitis. Although our sample size was too small to show a statistical significance, we believe that a clinically significant increase in mortality of necrotizing fasciitis occurred in patients with concomitant hepatitis C viral infection. Therefore, the presence of hepatitis C viral infection in patients presenting with symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis should raise the clinical suspicion for this diagnosis, with the potential for a worse prognosis."
11633,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is able to establish a latent infection during which the integrated provirus remains transcriptionally silent. In response to specific stimuli, the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) is highly activated, enhancing both transcriptional initiation and elongation. Here, we have identified a specific binding sequence of the nuclear NF-kappaB-repressing factor (NRF) within the HIV-1 LTR. The aim of this work was to define the role of NRF in regulating the LTR. Our data show that the endogenous NRF is required for transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR in stimulated cells. In unstimulated cells, however, NRF inhibits HIV-1 LTR activity at the level of transcription elongation. Binding of NRF to the LTR in unstimulated cells prevents recruitment of elongation factor DRB sensitivity-inducing factor and formation of processive elongation complexes by hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II. Our data suggest that NRF interrupts the regulatory coupling of LTR binding factors and transcription elongation events. This inhibitory mechanism might contribute to transcriptional quiescence of integrated HIV-1 provirus."
5219,0.005,1.0000,"The HIV-1 Vif protein suppresses the inhibition of viral replication caused by the human antiretroviral factor APOBEC3G. As a result, HIV-1 mutants that do not express the Vif protein are replication incompetent in 'nonpermissive' cells, such as primary T cells and the T-cell line CEM, that express APOBEC3G. In contrast, Vif-defective HIV-1 replicates effectively in 'permissive' cell lines, such as a derivative of CEM termed CEM-SS, that do not express APOBEC3G. Here, we show that a second human protein, APOBEC3F, is also specifically packaged into HIV-1 virions and inhibits their infectivity. APOBEC3F binds the HIV-1 Vif protein specifically and Vif suppresses both the inhibition of virus infectivity caused by APOBEC3F and virion incorporation of APOBEC3F. Surprisingly, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G are extensively coexpressed in nonpermissive human cells, including primary lymphocytes and the cell line CEM, where they form heterodimers. In contrast, both genes are quiescent in the permissive CEM derivative CEM-SS. Together, these data argue that HIV-1 Vif has evolved to suppress at least two distinct but related human antiretroviral DNA-editing enzymes."
7325,0.005,1.0000,"The death of CD4(+) CCR5(+) T cells is a hallmark of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We studied the plasma levels of cell death mediators and products--tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), Fas ligand, TNF receptor type 2 (TNFR-2), and plasma microparticles--during the earliest stages of infection following HIV type 1 (HIV-1) transmission in plasma samples from U.S. plasma donors. Significant plasma TRAIL level elevations occurred a mean of 7.2 days before the peak of plasma viral load (VL), while TNFR-2, Fas ligand, and microparticle level elevations occurred concurrently with maximum VL. Microparticles had been previously shown to mediate immunosuppressive effects on T cells and macrophages. We found that T-cell apoptotic microparticles also potently suppressed in vitro immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibody production by memory B cells. Thus, release of TRAIL during the onset of plasma viremia (i.e., the eclipse phase) in HIV-1 transmission may initiate or amplify early HIV-1-induced cell death. The window of opportunity for a HIV-1 vaccine is from the time of HIV-1 transmission until establishment of the latently infected CD4(+) T cells. Release of products of cell death and subsequent immunosuppression following HIV-1 transmission could potentially narrow the window of opportunity during which a vaccine is able to extinguish HIV-1 infection and could place severe constraints on the amount of time available for the immune system to respond to the transmitted virus."
2534,0.005,1.0000,"A survey of consultations to the Division of Nephrology at San Francisco General Hospital from 1982 to 1988 found only seven cases of proven or possible renal disease matching that described for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated nephropathy (nephrotic proteinuria, rapidly progressive renal insufficiency, and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis [FSGS] histologically). In the period from April 1, 1988 (the conclusion of the original survey) through December 31, 1990, a roughly 11-fold increase in the incidence of such cases among referrals of HIV-infected patients to the Division occurred compared with the initial experience. The patients were nearly exclusively black men, only about half of whom had intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) as an HIV risk factor. This striking increase was associated with a progressive increase in the number of black patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in San Francisco, and in the percentage of patients with an AIDS diagnosis discharged from San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) who were black. These data support other evidence indicating a particular vulnerability of blacks to this form of renal disease and help to reconcile data from our division with the experience reported from other centers."

This study explores the role of timing of ART intake, the information patients received from health workers, local adherence patterns, barriers to and facilitators of ART among 28 HIV-positive adults at the Senkatana HIV Clinic in Maseru, Lesotho. This qualitative, semi-structured interview study was carried out during February and March of 2011 and responses were analyzed inspired by the Grounded Theory method. Results were then compared and discussed between the authors and the main themes that emerged were categorized. The majority of the respondents reported having missed one or more doses of medicine in the past and it was a widespread belief among patients that they were required to skip the dose of ART if they were ""late"". The main barriers to adherence were interruptions of daily routines or leaving the house without sufficient medicine. The use of mobile phone alarms, phone clocks and support from family and friends were major facilitators of adherence. None of the patients reported to have been counseled on family support or the use of mobile phones as helpful methods in maintaining or improving adherence to ART. Being on-time with ART was emphasized during counseling by health workers. In conclusion, patients should be advised to take the dose as soon as they remember instead of skipping the dose completely when they are late. Mobile phones and family support could be subjects to focus on during future counseling particularly with the growing numbers of mobile phones in Africa and the current focus on telemedicine. "

This is a retrospective study, conducted on medical data of hospitalized cases of patients with HIV infection in the ITDU at the teaching hospital of Treichville (Abidjan) from 2006 to 2007. During the two years, 447 patients were included in the study. Their average age was 39 years [18 years-86 years] and sex ratio was 0.69. Of the 447 patients, 35% were unemployed and 67% were new patients who had never undergone antiretroviral therapy (ART). The duration of drug exposure was less than 6 months in 59% of treated patients. The average time to initiate ART was seven weeks. Among naive patients 41.9% were lost to follow up, 35.9% were waiting for treatment and 22.1% waiting for baseline biological test to initiate ART. At the initiation of ART, 79.6% of patients had a CD4 count less than 200/mm(3). The reasons of hospitalization defining AIDS were dominated by tuberculosis (34.2%), cerebral toxoplasmosis (17.9%) and neuromeningeal cryptococcosis (8%). The main reasons of hospitalization in classifying non-AIDS were pyelonephritis (6.5%), bacterial pneumonia (5.4%) and undetermined infectious encephalitis (4.9%). Hospital mortality was 24.4%. The leading causes of death were tuberculosis (22.9%), cerebral toxoplasmosis (20.2%), undetermined infectious encephalitis (18.3%) and cryptococcal meningitis (13.7%).

Mitochondrial abnormalities were evaluated in skeletal muscle obtained from 18 HIV-positive, ZDV-exposed patients, and 9 who were drug naive. All patients had clinical myopathy, and underwent neuromuscular evaluation with information recorded on timing and dosage of ZDV. All underwent muscle biopsies and samples were examined without knowledge of clinical history or ZDV status. Biopsy samples were evaluated by light and electron microscopy. Mitochondrial abnormalities were seen in ZDV-treated and -naive groups, and did not correlate with ZDV exposure or cumulative ZDV dosage. Mitochondrial abnormalities displayed significant correlation with the presence and severity of myofiber degeneration on biopsy, regardless of ZDV status. As mitochondrial abnormalities reflect myofiber degeneration, present in both patient groups, they may not be used as evidence of primary mitochondrial dysfunction. The etiology of myofiber degeneration in patients with HIV infection, whether ZDV-exposed or -naive, remains unclear."
6513,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1), the human foamy retrovirus and the simian immunodeficiency viruses have been associated with the development of an inflammatory myopathy in humans and primates. The myopathy caused by HIV and HTLV-1 is not due to direct infection of the muscle by these viruses, but rather due to an immunopathologic process triggered by the viruses, mediated by autoaggressive CD8+ cells in the context of MHC-class I antigen expression. This has been based on a series of studies utilizing immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization, polymerase chain reaction, and co-cultivation of human myotubes with the viruses or with HIV-1 and HTLV-1-infected homologous lymphoid cells. Because the clinical, histological and immunological picture of patients with retroviral-associated inflammatory myopathies is identical to that of patients with retroviral-negative inflammatory myopathy, there is a reasonable possibility that retroviruses may be candidate viruses in triggering inflammatory myopathies. In recent years, the antiretroviral drug AZT (Zidovudine), commonly used for the treatment of AIDS, has been shown to cause a distinct mitochondrial myopathy characterized by depletion of the muscle mitochondrial DNA due to AZT's ability to inhibit the gamma-DNA polymerase of the mitochondrial matrix. Distinction of the AZT-myopathy is clinically important because it responds to discontinuation of AZT and to administration of another antiretroviral agent such as ddI or ddC."

HCV knowledge in College students (43% correct) and HIV patients (54% correct) was significantly lower than in HCV patients (77% correct) and community healthcare workers (80% correct) (p < 0.001). Community workers' HCV knowledge was positively correlated with years of HCV work experience (r = 0.30, p < 0.01). This self-administered Brief HCV Knowledge scale has high levels of validity and reliability across patient, healthcare provider and college student populations. It has valuable applications as a clinical teaching tool with patients and healthcare providers and could be used as an outcome indicator in novel HCV educational intervention studies."
14878,0.005,1.0000,"Fifty-two patients on regular haemodialysis at our institution were evaluated for the presence of HCV infection. Evaluation included detailed history, clinical examination, and monthly screening for anti-HCV antibody, liver enzymes (ALT, AST), serum iron and ferritin. Also, three-monthly screening for other viral markers, HBV (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAb), CMV (IgG and IgM), EBV, and HIV. Anti-HCV antibody was found in 21 patients (40.4%). There was a significant (P less than 0.05) relationship between presence of anti-HCV antibody and proportion of patients who received blood transfusion. During a 12-month follow-up, four (11.4%) patients seroconverted to be Anti-HCV positive while one case (4.8%) seroconverted to be anti-HCV negative. The frequency of elevation of liver enzymes was significantly higher in Anti-HCV positive cases (14/18) than in negative cases (11/28, P = 0.01). Evaluation of liver biopsies of 13 patients showed chronic persistent hepatitis in six and chronic active hepatitis in seven cases. We concluded that hepatitis C is a common problem among chronic haemodialysis patients at our institution; HCV infection is documented in 70% of all clinically diagnosed NANB hepatitis. Presence of anti-HCV antibodies cannot differentiate between active and past infection and cases with early HCV infection can be missed when relying on the mere detection of anti-HCV antibodies."
364,0.005,1.0000,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes (HLA in humans) regulate the immune response to foreign antigens. Molecular and serologic techniques were used to identify products of HLA class I, class II and transporter (TAP) genes (also part of the MHC) in homosexual seroconverters to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Comprehensive statistical analysis produced an HLA profile that predicted time from HIV-1 infection to the onset of AIDS. The profile was developed in a cohort of 139 men and evaluated in a second unrelated cohort of 102 men. In the evaluation cohort, the profile discriminated a sixfold difference between groups with the shortest and longest times to AIDS (P = 0.001). These findings support current theory about control of antigen processing by HLA genes and have implications for immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 and other infections."
17893,0.005,1.0000,"A 66-year-old female patient with rheumatoid arthritis, who had been HBsAg-negative and anti-HBs-positive, developed hepatic dysfunction following low-dose methotrexate therapy. Serologic testing for HBsAg, HBeAg, IgM HBc and HBV DNA were positive. Despite antiviral therapy with lamivudine, the hepatic condition gradually deteriorated until the patient died. Since HBV replication persists in the liver even in individuals with resolved HBV infection (i.e., HBsAg-negative, anti-HBs-positive), HBV reactivation may occur in these patients with immunosuppression. Therefore, especially in endemic areas, all patients being considered for immunosuppressive therapy should be closely monitored with liver function tests and evaluated for HBV reappearance even when HBsAg-negative."
14048,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major public health threat. Enzyme immune assay (EIA) of HBsAg is the screening method used in most settings, including in blood banks. Other markers are used to evaluate the HBV replication, immunity and the infectious level of the patient. Testing negative for HBsAg, however, does not always mean the absence of infection, and testing other markers using EIA is costly. This study evaluated the diagnostic reliability of commercially available non-HBsAg HBV biomarkers to detect their usefulness to screen for HBV infection. INTEC rapid tests for HBV markers were evaluated in 508 HBsAg negative blood donors and were compared to EIA as a reference method. Only anti-HBs, anti-HBc and anti-HBe could be evaluated. Sensitivities of all tests (64.2, 85.48, and 82.78 respectively) were much lower than those claimed by the manufacturer. The specificities and negative predictive values for all tests exceeded 95% and 93% respectively and were lowest for anti-HBs. Anti-HBe had the highest accuracy (99.02%), while anti-HBs had the lowest (90.16%). It was concluded that the rapid test performance was lower than the manufacturer's reports. They are reliable tools to prove negativity, but less efficient to confirm reactivity. The best performance was for anti-HBe. The positive results of anti-HBs was significantly associated with higher ELISA titer levels, which is therefore recommended to be used for screening of immunity. "
10698,0.005,1.0000,"Elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels have been reported in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults, but there is little information in children. The aim of the present study was to compare serum IgE levels in HIV-positive and -negative children hospitalized with pneumonia in South Africa and to investigate whether IgE may be useful as a marker of specific infections or prognosis in HIV-infected children. History, examination, blood tests, and induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage were carried out. Of 122 children [45% female, median age 8 months (3-20 months)], 81 were infected with HIV. A history of allergy or asthma was present in three children (two of whom were HIV positive). Serum IgE was higher in HIV-infected children [83 (33-147) vs. 29 (6-113) IU/l; p = 0.011] as was immunoglobulin G (IgG) [49 (37-63) vs. 27.5 (23-34) g/l; p < 0.001].

Bacteremia occurred in 12 (10%) children; other specific pathogens identified included Mycobacterium tuberculosis in eight (7%) and Pneumocystis carinii in nine (7%). There was no correlation with CD4 count, CD4 : CD8 ratio, or the presence of specific pathogens, and IgE level. In-hospital mortality (11%) did not correlate with IgE levels. HIV-infected children with pneumonia have higher serum IgE compared with seronegative patients. In HIV-positive children, IgE levels did not correlate with the degree of immunosuppression or with outcome."
14201,0.005,1.0000,"Low-level production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) marks human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced immunodeficiency and has been ascribed to a bias towards T2 cytokines. This was investigated in two cross-sectional studies of HIV patients who were immunodeficient when they began antiretroviral therapy (ART) and had stable increases in CD4 T-cell counts. Blood leucocytes were assessed unstimulated or after stimulation with cytomegalovirus (CMV), anti-CD3 or mitogen. IFN-gamma and interleukin (IL)-5 responses were initially assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot-forming cell assay (ELISPOT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We then adopted a sensitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) system to assess IFN-gamma, IL-5, IL-4 and IL-4delta2 (an inhibitory splice variant of IL-4) mRNA. The results were correlated with putative serological markers of a T1 [lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), CD26] or a T2 [CD30, immunoglobulin E (IgE)] cytokine environment. IL-5 production and IgE levels were elevated in patients. IgE levels did not correlate with IFN-gamma, but showed an inverse correlation with IL-5 released in culture (P = 0.05). The levels of IL-4, IFN-gamma, IL-5 and IL-4delta2 mRNA were correlated after anti-CD3 stimulation, where IL-5 was the best predictor of IFN-gamma mRNA (P = 0.006). Weak positive correlations were evident between CD30 and cytokine mRNA levels, whilst IgE correlated inversely with IL-4, IL-4delta2, IL-5 and IFN-gamma mRNA levels. These analyses provide no evidence for an inverse relationship between T1 and T2 cytokine responses in HIV patients, but suggest that the elevation of IgE marks low cytokine responses."
14594,0.005,1.0000,"The emergence of syncytium-inducing (SI) variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in infected individuals is an indicator of poor prognosis and is often correlated with faster CD4(+) cell depletion and rapid disease progression. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a pleiotropic cytokine with various immune-modulating functions including induction of immunoglobulin E (IgE) production in B cells, down-regulation of CCR5 (a coreceptor for HIV-1 non-SI [NSI] strains), and up-regulation of CXCR4 (a coreceptor for HIV-1 SI variants). Here we show that homozygosity of a polymorphism in the IL-4 promoter region, IL-4 -589T, is correlated with increased rates of SI variant acquisition in HIV-1-infected individuals in Japan. This mutation was also shown to be associated with elevated serum IgE levels in HIV-1-infected individuals, especially in those at advanced stages of disease. In contrast, neither a triallele polymorphism in IL-10, another Th2 cytokine, nor a biallele polymorphism in the RANTES promoter affected acquisition of the SI phenotype. This finding suggested that IL-4-589T increases IL-4 production in the human body and thus accelerates the phenotypic switch of HIV-1 from NSI to SI and possibly disease progression of AIDS."
18919,0.005,1.0000,"We assessed correlations between body mass index and plasma lipids, immune activation markers and the CD4+ T-cell count. The subjects of this cross-sectional study were randomly selected and comprised all those who attended the AIDS Out-Patient Clinic at the University Hospital in Innsbruck in March and April 1992. Patients with signs and symptoms of acute bacterial and secondary opportunistic infections were excluded. We investigated 63 individuals with HIV infection of whom 35 were asymptomatic, 8 had oral candidiasis, 4 had constitutional signs and symptoms and 16 had AIDS, for an association among body mass index, urinary neopterin, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors (sTNFRs), plasma lipids, and the numbers of CD4+ T cells. The body mass index correlated inversely with urinary neopterin (rs = -0.42, p = 0.0009) and weakly with the numbers of CD4+ T cells (rs = 0.29, p = 0.02) but not with plasma lipids, sTNFRs and beta 2-microglobulin. The results show that body mass index correlates with immune activation. The data suggest that endogenous formation of interferon-gamma may be an important mediator of wasting in HIV infection, since this cytokine is responsible for the observed elevation of neopterin concentrations in body fluids."
2251,0.005,1.0000,"Several mathematical models have been investigated for the description of viral dynamics in the human body: HIV-1 infection is a particular and interesting scenario, because the virus attacks cells of the immune system that have a role in the antibody production and its high mutation rate permits to escape both the immune response and, in some cases, the drug pressure. The viral genetic evolution is intrinsically a stochastic process, eventually driven by the drug pressure, dependent on the drug combinations and concentration: in this article the viral genotypic drug resistance onset is the main focus addressed. The theoretical basis is the modelling of HIV-1 population dynamics as a predator-prey system of differential equations with a time-dependent therapy efficacy term, while the viral genome mutation evolution follows a Poisson distribution. The instant probabilities of drug resistance are estimated by means of functions trained from in vitro phenotypes, with a roulette-wheel-based mechanisms of resistant selection. Simulations have been designed for treatments made of one and two drugs as well as for combination antiretroviral therapies. The effect of limited adherence to therapy was also analyzed. Sequential treatment change episodes were also exploited with the aim to evaluate optimal synoptic treatment scenarios."

Before HAART, CD4 and CD8 T cell turnover was increased. However, the total number of proliferating CD4(+) T lymphocytes, i.e., CD4(+)Ki67(+) T lymphocytes, was not significantly different in HIV-infected (n = 73) and HIV-negative (n = 15) subjects, whereas proliferating CD8(+)Ki67(+) T lymphocytes were significantly higher in HIV-infected subjects. After HAART, the total body number of proliferating CD4(+)Ki67(+) T lymphocytes increased over time and was associated with an increase of both naive and memory CD4(+) T cells. The maximal increase (2-fold) was observed at week 36, whereas at week 72 the number of proliferating CD4(+) T cells dropped to baseline levels, i.e., before HAART. The kinetics of the fraction of proliferating CD4 and CD8 T cells were significantly correlated with the changes in the total body number of these T cell subsets. These results demonstrate a direct relationship between ex vivo measures of T cell production and quantitative changes in total body T lymphocyte populations. This study provides advances in the delineation of the kinetics of T cell production in HIV infection in the presence and/or in the absence of HAART."

It has been considered that persistent innate and acquired immune activation contributes to the pathogenesis of these non-AIDS related diseases. Immune activation has been related with several conditions, remarkably with the bacterial translocation related with the intestinal barrier damage by the HIV or by hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver cirrhosis. Consequently, increased morbidity and mortality must be expected in HIV-HCV coinfected patients. Disrupted gut barrier lead to an increased passage of microbial products and to an activation of the mucosal immune system and secretion of inflammatory mediators, which in turn might increase barrier dysfunction. In the present review, the intestinal barrier structure, measures of intestinal barrier dysfunction and the modifications of them in HIV monoinfection and in HIV-HCV coinfection will be considered. Both pathogenesis and the consequences for the progression of liver disease secondary to gut microbial fragment leakage and immune activation will be assessed. "

In this study, we sought to evaluate the efficacy of postoperative anti-HBV for intermediate-stage HCC patients who underwent radical liver resection.According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, this study enrolled 202 HCC patients who underwent liver resection and had a high HBV-DNA load. The patients were divided into 2 groups on the basis of postoperative anti-HBV therapy: group A included patients undergoing postoperative anti-HBV therapy, whereas group B patients did not receive any postoperative anti-HBV therapy. Factors including baseline demographics, tumor characteristics, overall long-term survival, tumor-free survival, and tumor recurrence rate were compared between the 2 groups. Moreover, univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify risk factors of HCC recurrence.Baseline demographics and tumor characteristics were comparable between the groups. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates in group A were 91.3%, 80.9%, and 66.1%, respectively, values that were significantly increased compared with group B (91.7%, 60.7%, and 52.4%, respectively, P = .019). Group A patients also exhibited enhanced 1-, 3-, and 5-year tumor-free survival compared with group B patients (87.0%, 67.0%, and 62.6%, respectively, in group A; 82.1%, 50.0%, and 42.9% in group B, P = .002). In addition, the tumor recurrence rate in group B was significantly increased compared with group A (P < .01). Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated lack of postoperative anti-HBV therapy [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.882; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.712-0.938; P = .042] to be a predictor of tumor recurrence.For intermediate-stage [Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B] HCC with a high HBV-DNA load, postoperative anti-HBV therapy after curative resection should be routine adjuvant therapy."

The viral effect in the cell is complicated and the overall disease outcome is the result of interaction between a few viral proteins and complex host immune response. Because it has been reported that XPG (Xeroderma pigementesum group G) gene does play a role in reducing UV induced apoptosis and participate in Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) process of DNA damage, it was hypothesized that polymorphism in this gene may have a role in HIV 1 disease progression to AIDS. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to find out the association between XPG gene polymorphism and its effect on the rate of HIV 1 disease progression to AIDS. 300 HIV seropositive cases and an equal number of age and sex matched controls were recruited for the study from north Indian population. The PCR-RFLP method was utilized to genotype 600 study subject for the XPG Asp (1104) His gene polymorphism.

This was a prospective follow-up study of HIV-infected women who participated in a randomized micronutrient supplementation trial conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. 795 HIV-infected Tanzanian women with singleton newborns were utilized from the cohort for this analysis. The proportion of women breastfeeding declined from 95% at 12 months to 11% at 24 months. The multivariate analysis showed breastfeeding cessation was significantly associated with increasing calendar year of delivery from 1995 to 1997 [risk ratio (RR), 1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-1.63], having a new pregnancy (RR 1.33; 95% CI 1.10-1.61), overweight [body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg m(-2) ; RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.07-1.75], underweight (BMI <18.5kg m(-2) ; RR 1.29; 95% CI 1.00-1.65), introduction of cow's milk at infant's age of 4 months (RR 1.30; 95% CI 1.04-1.63). Material and social support was associated with decreased likelihood of cessation (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.68-1.02). Demographic, health and nutritional factors among women and infants are associated with decisions by HIV-infected women to cease breastfeeding. The impact of breastfeeding counselling programs for HIV-infected African women should consider individual maternal, social and health contexts."
15041,0.005,1.0000,"The factors contributing to unequal mortality rates following Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in different groups at risk are poorly understood. We therefore compared the first episodes of PCP without prophylaxis in human immunodeficiency virus infected (HIV) and otherwise immunosuppressed patients in this retrospective study. A total of 58 HIV-infected and 16 otherwise immunosuppressed patients were analysed. The comparison included epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological and microbiological data, as well as therapy and clinical course. A prognostic analysis was performed using a logistic regression model. The mortality was significantly different in the two groups (HIV group 17 versus non-HIV group 50%). Renal transplant patients had a higher survival rate as compared to malignancy or collagen vascular disease as underlying diseases at risk. Acute respiratory failure was more common in the non-HIV group. Variables found to be significantly associated with lethal outcome in univariate analysis were alveolar to arterial pressures difference for oxygen (P(A-a),O2), haemoglobin, platelet count, total protein, serum albumin, and gamma-globulins in the HIV-group, and serum albumin in the non-HIV group. In the multivariate analysis of the HIV group, platelet count and gamma-globulins remained independent prognostic factors. In conclusion, in the HIV-group, mortality is closely related to the severeness of PCP as well as to the severeness of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) disease. In the non-HIV group, malignancy and collagen vascular disease as underlying conditions at risk account for the high mortality rate. Its severeness was mainly reflected by serum albumin, which represented the only variable found to be significantly associated with death in both groups."

HIV-infected infants were divided into those who were P1 (asymptomatic) or P2 (symptomatic) by 1 year of age. The P2 group was further divided into P2A (mildly symptomatic) and > P2A (rapidly symptomatic) by 1 year of age.

Serum samples were collected from 10,321 first blood donation voluntary male donors. All samples were screened for anti-HIV and anti-HCV by particle agglutination test, and syphilis antibody by RPR. The anti-HIV positive sera were repeated by EIA and confirmed by western blot. The reactive anti-HCV samples were confirmed by EIA whereas reactive syphilis antibody samples were confirmed by TPPA. Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analysis. The prevalence of anti-HIV in first time male donors was 0.70 per cent (72/10,321). The age of HIV group and 10,018 male control group ranged from 17-50 years old. The prevalence of HIV among 21-40 years old age group was significantly higher than the 17-20 years old (p = 0.00003). The 17-20 years old HIV group showed significantly higher sero-prevalence of TPPA (p = 0.003). The 21-30 years old HIV group gave significantly higher sero-prevalence of anti-HCV (p = 0.0008) and TPPA (p = 0.045), but the seroprevalence of anti-HCV and TPPA among the 31-50 year old group were nonsignificantly different (p > 0.05). The concurrence of anti-HCV and TPPA in HIV groups was not found.

In this study we evaluate the clinical spectrum of oral lesions in a series of HIV-infected patients when first examined at the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) clinic of a tertiary care institution in Mexico City, Mexico, and the changes observed over 12 years. All HIV-infected adult patients had an oral examination performed by specialists in oral pathology and medicine who used established clinical diagnostic criteria for oral lesions. Four periods were defined according to the evolving pattern of antiretroviral use: the first 2 were before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and the last 2 were during more established use of HAART. For the statistical analysis the chi-square test for contingency tables and the chi-square test for trend were utilized. For dimensional variables, except age, the Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney rank sum tests were used when applicable and trend was tested with the Spearman correlation coefficient. Age was tested through analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear regression analysis. Alpha value was set at p = 0.05 for each test. In the 12-year study, 1,000 HIV-infected patients were included (87.9% male). At the baseline examination, oral lesions strongly associated with HIV were present in 47.1% of HIV-infected patients. Oral candidosis (31.6%), hairy leukoplakia (22.6%), erythematous candidosis (21.0%), and pseudomembranous candidosis (15.8%) were the most frequent lesions. Oral Kaposi sarcoma (2.3%), HIV-associated periodontal disease (1.7%), and oral non-Hodgkin lymphoma (0.1%) were less frequent. HIV-related oral lesions decreased systematically-by half during the course of the 4 study periods (p < 0.001). Except for Kaposi sarcoma, all oral lesions strongly associated with HIV showed a trend to decrease significantly during the study period. No apparent variation in the occurrence of salivary gland disease or human papillomavirus-associated oral lesions was found. A significant trend to a lower prevalence was observed in the group of patients who were already taking antiretroviral therapy, non-HAART and HAART (p < 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively). Only a discrete reduction, barely significant, was noted among untreated patients (p = 0.060). By Period IV (1999-2001), those who received HAART showed the lowest prevalence of oral lesions strongly associated with HIV (p < 0.001). Patients with oral lesions strongly associated with HIV had significantly lower median CD4+ counts and higher viral loads than those without oral lesions strongly associated with HIV (p < 0.001 and p = 0.005, respectively). When CD4+ counts were correlated with prevalence of oral candidosis, a consistently negative association was found; this association prevailed even after the study group was partitioned according to period. In this selected cohort of 1,000 patients with HIV infection, the clinical spectrum of HIV-related oral lesions has changed over the 12-year study, with a decreased prevalence of most oral lesions. Our findings probably represent improvements in medical care of HIV-infected persons, earlier detection of HIV-infected patients at the AIDS clinic, the increasing use of prophylactic drugs to prevent secondary AIDS-related opportunistic infections, and, perhaps most important, the availability of potent antiretroviral therapy in recent years, since the introduction of HAART."

11497,0.005,1.0000,"Rapid disease progression and associated opportunistic infections contribute to high mortality rates among children aged <15 years with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (1). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has decreased childhood HIV-associated morbidity and mortality rates over the past decade (2). As accumulating evidence revealed lower HIV-associated mortality with early ART initiation, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines broadened ART eligibility for children with HIV infection (2). Age at ART initiation for children with HIV infection expanded sequentially in the 2010, 2013, and 2016 WHO guidelines to include children aged <2, <5, and <15 years, respectively, regardless of clinical or immunologic status (3-5). The United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has supported ART for children with HIV infection since 2003 and, informed by the WHO guidelines and a growing evidence base, PEPFAR-supported countries have adjusted their national pediatric guidelines. To understand the lag between guideline development and implementation, as well as the ART coverage gap, CDC assessed national pediatric HIV guidelines and analyzed Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; UNAIDS) data on children aged <15 years with HIV infection and the numbers of these children on ART. Timeliness of WHO pediatric ART guideline adoption varied by country; >50% of children with HIV infection are not receiving ART, underscoring the importance of strengthening case finding and linkage to HIV treatment in pediatric ART programs."
8193,0.005,1.0000,"Increased cardiovascular risk has been linked to HIV infection and combination antiretroviral therapy, but the impact of hepatitis C virus (HCV) status on indices of cardiovascular risk has not been routinely assessed in the HIV-infected population. The objective of this study was to analyze associations of HCV, HIV, and combination antiretroviral therapy with lipid levels and C-reactive protein (CRP) among older men. We measured fasting total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride, and high-sensitivity CRP serum levels in a cross-sectional study of 108 HIV-infected and 74 HIV-uninfected at-risk older men. One hundred ten men (60%) had detectable HCV RNA, with no difference by HIV status (p = 0.25). The majority (88%) of men with HCV infection had a history of injection drug use. Among all men, HCV infection was independently associated with lower total cholesterol (p < 0.001), LDL-C (p < 0.001), triglycerides (p = 0.01), and CRP (p = 0.001). Among HIV-infected men, HCV infection was associated with lower total cholesterol (p < 0.001), LDL-C (p < 0.001), and CRP (p = 0.004). HCV infection was associated with lower triglycerides among men on protease inhibitors (PI) (p = 0.02) and non-PI combination antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.02), but not among antiretroviral-naïve men. These findings demonstrate an association of lower serum lipid and CRP levels with HCV infection and suggest that HCV status should be assessed as an important correlate of cardiovascular risk factors in studies of older men with or at risk for HIV."

The simplest approach to assessment is serial weight measurement. A comprehensive nutritional assessment includes (1) anthropometric measurements of body composition; (2) biochemical measurements of serum protein, micronutrients, and metabolic parameters; (3) clinical assessment of altered nutritional requirements and social or psychological issues that may preclude adequate intake; and (4) measurement of dietary intake. Techniques for measuring body composition of fat and lean body mass include anthropometry and bioelectric impedance analysis. Other techniques, including dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), hydrodensitometry, total body potassium measurement, and cross-sectional computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging are available in research centers. Anthropometry, including waist-hip ratios, regional DXA, and cross-sectional imaging, is best for detecting morphologic changes associated with fat redistribution syndrome.

Chronic heavy alcohol consumption and HIV/AIDS both result in reduced lean body mass and muscle dysfunction, increasing the incidence of comorbid conditions. Previous studies from our laboratory using rhesus macaques infected with Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) demonstrated that chronic binge alcohol (CBA) administration in the absence of antiretroviral therapy exacerbates skeletal muscle (SKM) wasting at end-stage SIV disease. The aim of this study was to characterize how CBA alters global gene regulatory networks that lead to SKM wasting at end-stage disease. Administration of intragastric alcohol or sucrose to male rhesus macaques began 3 months prior to SIV infection and continued throughout the duration of study. High-output array analysis was used to determine CBA-dependent changes in mRNA expression, miRNA expression, and promoter methylation status of SKM at end-stage disease (~10 months post-SIV) from healthy control (control), sucrose-administered, SIV-infected (SUC/SIV), and CBA-administered/SIV-infected (CBA/SIV) macaques."

In addition to its function as the key trans-activator of viral transcription, Tat is also secreted by the infected cell and taken up by neighboring cells where it has an effect both on infected and uninfected cells. In this review we will focus on the relationship between the structure of the Tat protein and its function as a secreted factor. To this end we will summarize some of the exogenous functions of Tat that have been implicated in HIV-1 pathogenesis and the impact of structural variations and viral subtype variants of Tat on those functions. Finally, since in some patients the presence of Tat-specific antibodies or CTL frequencies are associated with slow or non-progression to AIDS, we will also discuss the role of Tat as a potential vaccine candidate, the advances made in this field, and the importance of using a Tat protein capable of eliciting a protective or therapeutic immune response to viral challenge."
12685,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus infection is currently the most important cause of chronic viral hepatitis worldwide and is one of the most frequent causes of end-stage liver disease. With the international implementation of the hepatitis B vaccine and combined prophylaxis for infants born to HBsAg(+) mothers, the prevalence of hepatitis B has decreased remarkably. However, intra-uterine transmission has become a critical bottleneck for eliminating hepatitis B infection. The efficacy of nucleos(t)ide analogs on inhibiting hepatitis B replication has been widely confirmed, and the quality of life and the survival of individuals with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) have improved to a great degree. However, with the availability of long-term antiviral treatment and the ever increasing ageing population, renal disorders should be considered when choosing antiviral medicines. The antiviral efficacy and safety of telbivudine (LdT) have been shown in patients with CHB infection, and LdT is approved as a class B drug for pregnancy. Furthermore, the renal protective function of LdT has been demonstrated recently. In this review, we will focus on the efficacy and safety of LdT in gravidas with CHB infection, as well as the renal protective function of LdT in CHB patients. LdT might provide physicians with a solid option for effectively treating patients with CHB, especially gravidas or those either with or at risk of renal impairment."
7573,0.005,1.0000,"Following infection with Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) there is a remarkable variation in virus replication and disease progression. Both host and viral factors have been implicated in the observed differences in disease status. Here, we focus on understanding the contribution of HIV-1 viral protein R (Vpr) by evaluating the disease-associated Vpr polymorphism and its biological functions from HIV-1 positive rapid progressor (RP) and long-term nonprogressor (LTNP) subjects. Results presented here show distinct variation in phenotypes of Vpr alleles from LTNP and RP subjects. Most notably, the polymorphism of Vpr at R36W and L68M associated with RP shows higher levels of oligomerization, and increased virus replication, whereas R77Q exhibits poor replication kinetics. Interestingly, we did not observe correlation with cell cycle arrest function. Together these results indicate that polymorphisms in Vpr in part may contribute to altered virus replication kinetics leading to the observed differences in disease progression in LTNP and RP groups.

5681,0.005,1.0000,"Chemokines are the chemoattractant cytokines which function briefly in inflammatory processes and also act as regulatory bridge molecules between innate and acquired immunity. Chemokines mediate their effects by binding to cell surface receptors that belong to the seven transmembrane domain superfamily of proteins, which are found mainly on the surface of leucocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes. Besides the functions in the immune system, certain chemokine receptors also function as co-receptors, in addition to CD4 molecule, for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry into the target cells. Of these a beta-chemokine receptor CCR5 and an alpha chemokine receptor CXCR4 are the major co-receptors required for macrophage-tropic and T cell-tropic viruses, respectively. Genetic analysis has revealed the importance of chemokine receptor genes in the disease progression, and the identification of genetic polymorphisms such as alterations in the CCR5 gene that prevent surface expression, leads explaining why some people with CCR5 mutation are protected from HIV infection. Today it is accepted that chemokine gene deletion mutations and high production of chemokines are the host factors which take place in the resistance mechanisms of HIV-infected non- or slow-progressors. Depending on these data, recent studies have focused on chemokine receptor inhibitors and/or chemokine antagonists as the new therapeutic strategies that prevent HIV from interacting with receptors and block HIV infection. In this review, latest developments in chemokine receptor researches with a particular focus on their roles in HIV pathogenesis and resistance to HIV infection, have been discussed."

Prior reports focus on perioperative complications, but longer-term outcomes remain unclear. The authors specifically analyzed clinical outcomes, perioperative complications, and survivorship free of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) of THAs and TKAs in HIV-positive patients who had extended follow-up. A total of 21 HIV-positive patients who underwent 29 primary arthroplasties (14 THAs, 15 TKAs) from 1992 to 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Mean age was 43 years and mean follow-up was 8 years. Mean perioperative CD4 cell count was 450 cells/mL; only 2 patients had perioperative CD4 cell counts less than 200 cells/mL. At mid-term follow-up, THAs and TKAs were reliable in improving function (mean postoperative Harris Hip Score: 87, P<.01; mean postoperative Knee Society Score: 83, P<.01). The rate of perioperative complications was high (17%). Patients with both hemophilia and HIV were at particular risk for complications at 33% (P=.04). Survivorship free of deep PJI was 100% in THAs at 10 years and 93% in TKAs at 10 years. Only 1 (7%) patient (1 TKA), who had a perioperative CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mL, was revised for deep PJI. In HIV-positive patients, both THAs and TKAs are reliable in alleviating pain and improving clinical function at mid-term follow-up. However, HIV-positive patients are at substantial risk of perioperative complications, especially with comorbid hemophilia. With antiretroviral therapy and maintained CD4 cell counts above 200 cells/mL, survivorship free of deep PJI approaches 100%. [Orthopedics. 2017; 40(4):e699-e702.]."
4145,0.005,1.0000,"The adaptive immune system, including type1 helper T cells (Th1 cells), cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and dendritic cells (DCs), plays an important role in the control of hepatitis B virus (HBV). On the other hand, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) suppress the immune reaction in HBV and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Excessive activation of immune suppressive cells could contribute to the persistent infection of HBV and the progression of HCC. The frequency and/or function of Tregs could affect the natural course in chronic hepatitis B patients and the treatment response. In addition to the suppressive function of MDSCs, MDSCs could affect the induction and function of Tregs. Therefore, we should understand in detail the mechanism by which Tregs and MDSCs are induced to control HBV persistent infection and HBV-related HCC. Immune suppressive cells, including Tregs and MDSCs, contribute to the difficulty in inducing an effective immune response for HBV persistent infection and HBV-related HCC. In this review, we focus on the Tregs and MDSCs that could be potential targets for immune therapy of chronic hepatitis B and HBV-related HCC. "
16640,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1-infected patients have low circulating tryptophan concentrations despite evidence of adequate dietary intake of this essential amino acid. A chronic increase in inducible tryptophan oxidation is the basis of HIV-1-associated tryptophan depletion. This metabolic process results in the irretrievable loss of tryptophan molecules from the available pool. Such sustained disruption of normal tryptophan metabolism over time disturbs the many metabolic processes involving this amino acid, and has been implicated in some features of AIDS pathogenesis. Normal T-cell function is adversely affected by tryptophan depletion, but the extent of the effect in HIV-1-infected patients is still unclear. Attempting to directly supplement tryptophan is not advised given the potential increase in circulating concentrations of neurotoxic intermediates. Although only preliminary data are available, evidence suggests that antiretroviral and nicotinamide treatments can boost plasma tryptophan concentrations in HIV-1-infected patients and impact the secondary effects of tryptophan depletion. Additional study of this metabolism could lead to improved treatment strategies for patients with HIV infection. In this review I focus on the potential links between disturbed tryptophan metabolism and pathogenesis."
18018,0.005,1.0000,"The emergence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains resistant to highly active antiretroviral therapy necessitates continued drug discovery for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Most current drug discovery strategies focus upon a single aspect of HIV-1 replication. A virus-cell-based assay, which can be adapted to high-throughput screening, would allow the screening of multiple targets simultaneously. HIV-1-based vector systems mimic the HIV-1 life cycle without yielding replication-competent virus, making them potentially important tools for the development of safe, wide-ranging, rapid, and cost-effective assays amenable to high-throughput screening. Since replication of vector virus is typically restricted to a single cycle, a crucial question is whether such an assay provides the needed sensitivity to detect potential HIV-1 inhibitors. With a stable, inducible vector virus-producing cell line, the inhibitory effects of four reverse transcriptase inhibitors (zidovudine, stavudine, lamivudine, and didanosine) and one protease inhibitor (indinavir) were assessed. It was found that HIV-1 vector virus titer was inhibited in a single cycle of replication up to 300-fold without affecting cell viability, indicating that the assay provides the necessary sensitivity for identifying antiviral molecules. Thus, it seems likely that HIV-1-derived vector systems can be utilized in a novel fashion to facilitate the development of a safe, efficient method for screening compound libraries for anti-HIV-1 activity."
10111,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the United States; the prevalence in maintenance hemodialysis patients substantially exceeds that in the general population. In hemodialysis patients, HCV infection has been associated with increased occurrence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and increased mortality. Injection drug use and receipt of blood transfusions before 1992 has accounted for most prevalent HCV infections in the United States. However, HCV transmission among patients undergoing hemodialysis has been documented frequently. Outbreak investigations have implicated lapses in infection control practices as the cause of HCV infections. Preventing these infections is an emerging priority for renal care providers, public health agencies, and regulators. Adherence to recommended infection control practices is effective in preventing HCV transmission in hemodialysis facilities. In addition, adoption of routine screening to facilitate the detection of incident HCV infections and hemodialysis-related transmission is an essential component of patient safety and infection prevention efforts.

In Brazil, these measures have been in place since 1996. The aim of this study was to evaluate the current HBV and HCV epidemiology among hemodialysis patients in the State of Tocantins comparing them with those found 14 years ago. There was a significant decline in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV prevalence from 4% and 13% in 2001 to 0.8% and 2.8% in 2014-2015, respectively (p < 0.05). Variables related to hemodialysis environment such as working shift and length of time on hemodialysis treatment were no longer associated to HCV and HBV exposure in 2014-2015. A high prevalence of self-reported hepatitis B vaccination was observed in both periods, but only 30% of the individuals showed serological profile of effective previous immunization, suggesting a low compliance with surveillance of hepatitis B immunization in hemodialysis centers. The significant decline in viral hepatitis B and C prevalence in hemodialysis patients in Tocantins underscores the importance of infection control measures, but the low frequency of protective serological profile after immunization against hepatitis B points to the need for greater vigilance of the patients' vaccination."

An assay of anti-HCV antibodies was performed using both first- and second-generation immunoenzymatic tests, and anti-HCV specificity was confirmed with a second-generation recombinant immunoblot assay. Of 548 hemodialysis patients, 90 (16.4%) were positive with first-generation, and 166 (30.3%) with second-generation tests. These rates were significantly higher than those for either hospital staff members (0.5% and 2.3%; p < 0.01) or healthy blood donors (0.98% and 1.30%; p < 0.001). Patients with a history of blood transfusion tended to have a higher positivity rate for anti-HCV than did the non-transfused group (35.4% vs. 25.7% with second generation tests; p < 0.05). Positivity for anti-HCV was related to the duration of hemodialysis. Only a few patients seroconverted during the 2-year, 5-month period between the previous and present studies. Although hemodialysis patients remain a high-risk group for HCV infection, the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies has decreased recently thanks to the use of erythropoietin for renal anemia, the universal screening of blood donors for anti-HCV antibodies, and improvements in infection control measures for this virus."

Of 2,123 centers surveyed, 2,046 (96%), representing 155,877 patients and 40,298 staff members, responded. The 1991 survey found that certain hemodialysis practices are increasing in frequency, including use of bicarbonate dialysate and high-flux dialysis and reuse of disposable dialyzers (in 1991, 71% of centers reused dialyzers). Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was present at low frequency in patients (incidence = 0.2%, prevalence = 1.3%) and staff (incidence = 0.04%, prevalence = 0.3%). Among centers that had > or = HBsAg positive patient, the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was lower in those centers that used a separate room for dialysis of HBsAg positive patients. Reuse of dialyzers, blood lines, transducer filters, or dialyzer caps was not associated with an increased risk of acquiring HBV infection among either patients or staff. Antibody to HBsAg was present in 21% of patients and 53% of staff, and was significantly related to levels of hepatitis B vaccine coverage. Pyrogenic reactions in the absence of septicemia were reported by 20% of centers and associated with the reuse of dialyzers.

One hundred twenty-nine patients undergoing hemodialysis in 1986 and 1987 were tested for antibody against both viral antigens by EIA (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Seroreactive samples for HIV-1 and/or HTLV-I were confirmed by Western blot and, for HTLV-I, by viral cultures. Thirty patients (23.2%) were positive for retroviral infection (22 for HIV-1 alone, four for HTLV-I alone, and four for both HIV-1 and HTLV-I). The most important risk factor was intravenous drug use, followed by blood transfusion. Patients with HIV-1 had lower T4-T8 ratios and higher mortality than those with HTLV-I infection alone. It was concluded that HTLV-I, as well as HIV-1, infection is endemic in chronic dialysis centers in Miami.

Three health beliefs indices were identified: antiretroviral therapy (ART) benefits, ART adherence self-efficacy, and beliefs about future HIV-related health concerns. Patients who experienced medication side-effects reported strong beliefs that HIV infection would cause them future health problems or distrust in the benefits of ART. AIDS diagnosis obtained through medical records or medication side-effects were not related to any of the three types of adherence. Beliefs about future HIV-related health concerns were associated with suboptimal dose adherence. Beliefs about ART benefits were associated with suboptimal schedule and dietary instructions adherence. Older age and partner were protective factors of schedule adherence. Data suggest that health beliefs may vary across type of adherence and that adherence behaviours may be a coping strategy to adjust antiretroviral therapy to one's daily living."

At least 95% adherence to HAART is optimum and studies have shown that 50%. Important factors that influence adherence to HAART such as regimen related complexities, patient/family related issues and factors related to healthcare delivery system makes adherence to HAART challenging. Although numerous interventions to improve adherence have been investigated in developed as well as developing countries, majority of work in this area is focused on adherence in adults and data in children is limited.

However, HAART is unable to reconstitute HIV-specific immunity and eradicate the virus. Several observations in primate models and in humans support the notion that cell-mediated immunity can control viral replication and slow disease progression. Thus, besides drugs, an immunotherapy that induces long-lasting HIV-specific T-cell responses could play a role in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. To induce such immune responses, DermaVir Patch has been developed. DermaVir consists of an HIV-1 antigen-encoding plasmid DNA that is chemically formulated in a nanoparticle. DermaVir is administered under a patch after a skin preparation that supports the delivery of the nanoparticle to Langerhans cells (LC). Epidermal LC trap and transport the nanomedicine to draining lymph nodes. While in transit, LC mature into dendritic cells (DC), which can efficiently present the DNA-encoded antigens to naïve T-cells for the induction of cellular immunity. Pre-clinical studies and Phase I clinical testing of DermaVir in HIV-1-infected individuals have demonstrated the safety and tolerability of DermaVir Patch. To further modulate cellular immunity, molecular adjuvants might be added into the nanoparticle. DermaVir Patch represents a new nanomedicine platform for immunotherapy of HIV/AIDS. In this review, the antiviral activity of DermaVir-induced cellular immunity is discussed. Furthermore, the action of some cytokines currently being tested as adjuvants are highlighted and the adjuvant effect of cytokine plasmid DNA included in the DermaVir nanoparticle is reviewed."

The overall prevalence of HTLV-I antibody was 12.6% (59/469) among Japanese immigrant populations, but increased with age, being 16.2% (49/303) among adults and 6.0% (10/166) among children; no significant difference in relation to sex was noted. The first generation immigrants (issei) from Kyushu, the large southwestern island of Japan where adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is endemic, had 19.0% (49/258) HTLV-I seroprevalence, while issei from outside Kyushu had none (0/39). Among Bolivian members of the community, consisting mostly of Indians and persons of Spanish descent, the HTLV-I seroprevalence was 4.3% (7/164) overall, 2.4% (1/42) among adults and 4.9% (6/122) among children. No antibody to HIV was detected among Japanese or Bolivian populations. The results of this study show that: (1) there is a considerable number of HTLV-I carriers among Japanese immigrant populations in Bolivia, especially among immigrants from Kyushu, (2) there exist some HTLV-I carriers among Bolivian natives, raising the possibility of HTLV-I transmission by co-habitation with Japanese immigrants, (3) HIV is far from endemic in this district of Bolivia, at present."
9561,0.005,1.0000,"Central nervous system disease is a frequent finding in both pediatric and adult AIDS. Microglia have been shown to be the major target of HIV-1 infection in the central nervous system. However, studies in vitro concerning susceptibility of human microglia to HIV-1 infection reported conflicting results; microglia from adult brain showed productive infection by HIV-1, whereas microglia from fetal brain did not. To investigate this further and to define the possible mechanisms responsible for this difference, we prepared highly purified human microglial cell cultures from fetuses of 16 to 24 weeks' gestation and exposed them to monocytotropic (HIV-1 JR-FL and HIV-1 JR-CSF) isolates of HIV-1. Culture supernatants were examined for the presence of p24 antigen for a 4-week period after viral exposure. Concurrently, potential cytopathic effects and cellular viral antigen expression (gp41 and p24) were examined by light microscopy in combination with immunocytochemistry. The results showed that human fetal microglia can be productively infected by HIV-1 as judged by p24 antigen capture assay, syncytia formation, and gp41 and p24 immunoreactivity of infected microglia. In addition, by electron microscopy, numerous viral particles characteristic of HIV-1 were present both in the intracellular and extracellular compartments. Uninfected cultures or astrocytes overgrown in the microglial cultures did not show evidence of infection under identical experimental conditions. These data demonstrate that human fetal microglia, like their adult counterparts, are susceptible to HIV-1 infection in vitro and can support the production of virus."
5455,0.005,1.0000,"Infection of microglial cells by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is supposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of AIDS-related central nervous system (CNS) complications. So far, however, experimental data about interactions between HIV and ramified microglia from the adult CNS were only occasionally reported, making it difficult to understand the exact nature of pathogenic events contributing to HIV-encephalopathy. Therefore, we used the animal model of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection of domestic cats to establish an experimental system which is suitable for studying the relationships between an immunodeficiency virus and the mature ramified microglia of the central nervous system. By means of density gradient centrifugation approximately 95% pure microglial cells could be isolated from adult feline brain that were characterized by their CD45(low) phenotype. Resident microglia extracted from the CNS of experimentally infected cats harbored FIV-specific DNA and cocultivation with mitogen-activated, but uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) resulted in recovery of high-titered infectious virus. Double labeling of brain cell monocultures explanted from persistently infected animals for both microglia and FIV markers disclosed less than 1% of viral antigen expressing microglial cells. This suggests that during the subclinical phase of the infection only a small number of brain-resident macrophages are productively infected. However, interaction of FIV-infected microglia and inflammatory lymphocytes may promote viral replication, thus supporting viral spread in brain tissue."
5784,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B and C virus infection prevalence was investigated in the Island of Jeju (formerly Cheju), the Republic of Korea, by means of a small-scale sero-epidemiological survey in 2000. Adult women in the city of Jeju (the provincial capital) and two fishing-farming villages A and B were invited to offer venous blood samples for immunological examination for infection markers of two virus and serum biochemistry for liver function. In practice, 66 married women (33, 16 and 17 women from the city, Village A and Village B, respectively) volunteered. Sera were separated on site and were assayed for HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HCV positivities and liver function markers including AST, ALT and gamma-GTP. The serum assay showed that the prevalence of HbsAg+ or anti-HCV+ cases was low (5 and 2%, respectively), whereas that of anti-HBs+ and anti-HBc+ cases were high (71 and 62%) so that the over-all HBV positivity was 82%. There were essentially no urban-rural difference or age-dependent changes in the positivity. Comparison with the prevalence reported in literature shows that prevalence of HBsAg+ and anti-HCV+ is in general agreement with the values reported for the populations in general, but HBV+ prevalence might be somewhat higher than the levels reported for the general populations."
15954,0.005,1.0000,"The authors tested the impact of social instability on adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among patients infected with HIV through injection drug use (IDU; MANIF2000 cohort). In the study, they analyzed sociodemographic baseline characteristics to develop an indicator of social instability. Information concerning adherence to HAART was collected through questionnaires during a 2-year follow-up period. Factors associated with nonadherence were studied in two different groups: 1) patients who had stopped injection drug use (ex-IDUs) and who were not in drug maintenance programs (DMT) during the entire follow-up period, and 2) those who were still opiate dependent. Among the 210 eligible patients, 114 were classified as ex-IDUs and 96 as opiate dependent. Ex-IDUs reported nonadherence behaviors in 96 of 384 visits (25.0%), while opiate-dependent patients were nonadherent in 111 of 308 visits (36.0%; p = .02). Among ex-IDUs, the only factor associated with nonadherence was social instability, while among opiate-dependent patients, injection behavior was the only determinant of nonadherence behavior. For opiate-dependent patients, DMT may enhance adherence to HAART, but only if it is successful in reducing abuse of injection practices. For ex-IDUs, it is very important that the management of social difficulties be taken into account to increase adherence to HAART."
5546,0.005,1.0000,"Opiate abuse is a risk factor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Because the direct effects of opiates on HIV infection are difficult to determine epidemiologically, animal models of lentivirus infection are relied upon to study the effects of opiates in the absence of confounding factors. Morphine, the predominant metabolite of heroin, is used in most experimental systems examining heroin abuse. In this study, morphine treatment of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected cats modeled a typical pattern of escalating drug use interspersed with withdrawals. Plasma cortisol levels were measured for evidence of stress associated with morphine withdrawal. In the morphine-treated cats, cortisol levels peaked at time points corresponding to morphine withdrawal and returned to baseline levels during treatment and several weeks after the final withdrawal. Morphine-treated cats displayed clear behavioral and physical signs of opiate exposure and evidence of withdrawal when the drug was stopped. Morphine-exposed cats did not experience enhanced severity of FIV-related disease; in fact, morphine demonstrated a protective effect on FIV-associated changes in brainstem auditory evoked potentials. Our research suggests that opiate exposure is unlikely to adversely affect the progression of acute lentivirus infection and might be beneficial in controlling associated neurological disease."
12452,0.005,1.0000,"At the cellular level, cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exhibit immunity to a second infection by the virus that initiated the first infection or by related viruses [superinfection resistance (SIR)]. In the case of HIV infection, SIR was basically attributed to downregulation of the CD4 receptors. We have recently reported on an interaction between HIV-1 Rev and integrase (IN) proteins, which results in inhibition of IN activity in vitro and integration of cDNA in HIV-1-infected cells. A novel function for the viral Rev protein in controlling integration of HIV cDNAs was thus proposed. The results of the present work suggest involvement of the inhibitory Rev in sustaining SIR. A single exposure to wild-type HIV-1 resulted in one to two integrations per cell. The number of integrated proviral cDNA copies remained at this low level even after double infection or superinfection. SIR was dependent on Rev expression by the strain used for the first infection and was eliminated by peptides that disrupt intracellular complex formation between IN and Rev. The same lack of resistance was observed in the absence of Rev, namely following first infection with a DeltaRev HIV strain. The involvement of Rev, expressed from either unintegrated or integrated viral cDNA, in promoting SIR was clearly demonstrated. We conclude that SIR involves Rev-dependent control of HIV cDNA integration."

In transient transfection assays, these LTRs demonstrated no significant difference in basal or stimulated levels of transcription in any of a variety of cell lines tested, compared with expression directed from the LTR of a T-lymphocyte-tropic strain of HIV-1. Chimeric viruses were created with the LTRs of the macrophage-tropic and brain-derived viruses ligated to the viral backbone from a T-lymphocyte-tropic strain. No change in cellular tropism was demonstrated with these chimeric viruses. Thus, unlike the LTRs of some murine retroviruses, the LTR of HIV-1 does not appear to play a major role in determining cellular tropism."

Eleven laboratories participated in this comparison study of 14 methods for detection of HIV neutralizing antibodies (NA). A panel of 10 coded sera and a positive and a negative control serum were tested in each assay. The 10 coded samples included aliquots of the same sera that were distributed as positive and negative control sera, an aliquot of the WHO reference human anti-HIV-1 serum, and seven other sera from people with HIV-1 infection. Each laboratory reported features of its test methods and results. The results demonstrated excellent within laboratory and between laboratory consistency. The most important variable appeared to be the virus strain used. Cell line, conditions of neutralization or culture, method of endpoint determination, or use of VSV pseudotypes did not appear to be important variables. The results indicate that standardization of HIV-1 NA assays should be readily achievable."
8743,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection causes dysfunction of different organ systems. Myocardial diastolic dysfunction has been reported previously in an adult HIV population. Our aim was to study myocardial strain in children and young adults infected by HIV who have apparently normal ejection fraction. Forty HIV-infected patients (mean age 20.6 ± 1.5 years) with normal ejection fraction and 55 matched normal controls (mean age 17 ± 1.5 years) were studied by two-dimensional echocardiogram. The images were stored then exported to velocity vector imaging software for analysis. Measures considered were left-ventricular peak global systolic strain (LV S) and strain rate (LV SR) as well as right-ventricular peak global systolic strain (RV S) and strain rate (RV SR). Circumferential measures of the left ventricle included the following: LV circumferential peak global systolic strain (LV circ S), strain rate (LV circ SR), radial velocity (LV rad vel), and rotational velocity (LV rot vel) at the level of the mitral valve. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The means of all longitudinal deformation parameters were significantly lower in HIV patients compared with normal controls: LV S (-14.15 vs. -19.31), LV SR (-0.88 vs. -1.30), RV S (-19.58 vs. -25.09), and RV SR (-1.34 vs. -2.13), respectively (p < 0.05). LV rot vel was lower in patients compared with controls (43.23 vs. 51.71, p = 0.025). LV circ S, LV circ SR, and LV rad vel showed no significant difference between the two groups (p ≥ 0.05). HIV infection affects longitudinal systolic cardiac strain and strain rate in children and young adults. Normal ejection fraction might be attributed to preserved circumferential myocardial deformation. Strain and strain rate may help identify HIV patients at high risk for cardiac dysfunction and allow early detection of silent myocardial depression."
9396,0.005,1.0000,"The binding properties of seven CD4-blocking monoclonal antibodies raised against recombinant gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strain MN (HIV-1MN) and two CD4-blocking monoclonal antibodies to recombinant envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp160 of substrain IIIB of HIVLAI were analyzed. With a panel of recombinant gp120s from seven diverse HIV-1 isolates, eight of the nine antibodies were found to be strain specific and one was broadly cross-reactive. Epitope mapping revealed that all nine antibodies bound to epitopes located in the fourth conserved domain (C4) of gp120. Within this region, three distinct epitopes could be identified: two were polymorphic between HIV-1 strains, and one was highly conserved. Studies with synthetic peptides demonstrated that the conserved epitope, recognized by antibody 13H8, was located between residues 431 and 439. Site-directed mutagenesis of gp120 demonstrated that residue 429 and/or 432 was critical for the binding of the seven antibodies to gp120 from HIV-1MN. Similarly, residues 423 and 429 were essential for the binding of monoclonal antibody 5C2 raised against gp120 from HIV-1IIIB. The amino acids located at positions 423 and 429 were found to vary between strains of HIV-1 as well as between molecular clones derived from the MN and LAI isolates of HIV-1. Polymorphism at these positions prevented the binding of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and raised the possibility that HIV-1 neutralization serotypes may be defined on the basis of C4 domain sequences. Analysis of the binding characteristics of the CD4-blocking antibodies demonstrated that their virus-neutralizing activity was directly proportional to their gp120-binding affinity. These studies account for the strain specificity of antibodies to the C4 domain of gp120 and demonstrate for the first time that antibodies to this region can be as effective as those directed to the principal neutralizing determinant (V3 domain) in neutralizing HIV-1 infectivity."
15927,0.005,1.0000,"97 sera collected during a 10-year period from 10 HIV-1 infected individuals were tested for neutralizing capacity against a virus isolate FICPH-22 obtained from a Danish AIDS patient, and the laboratory strain HTLV-IIIB. Three patterns of serum neutralizing activity were demonstrated: (a) patients developing high neutralizing activity against both HIV strains; (b) patients developing high neutralizing activity against the Danish virus isolate; and (c) patients developing only low titers of neutralizing antibodies (NA) against both HIV strains. The HTLV-IIIB strain was less sensitive to serum neutralization than the FICPH-22 isolate and the appearance of NA against HTLV-IIIB was typically lacking several years behind that against FICPH-22 indicating a broadening of the NA response over time. No difference in clinical outcome was observed comparing patients reaching high titers of NA and patients with low titers. Development of AIDS among patients reaching high titers of NA was preceded by a decline in NA titers, indicating an association of high titers of NA with the healthy carrier state and of declining or low titers of NA with disease progression. The majority of the neutralizing activity was mediated by IgG, but some neutralizing activity was demonstrated in the IgG depleted serum, indicating the presence of additional neutralizing substances in serum."
10457,0.005,1.0000,"Macrophage-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains are able to grow to high titers in human monocyte-derived macrophages. However, it was recently reported that cellular protein SAMHD1 restricts HIV-1 replication in human cells of the myeloid lineage, including monocyte-derived macrophages. Here we show that degradation of SAMHD1 in monocyte-derived macrophages was associated with moderately enhanced growth of the macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strain. SAMHD1 degradation was induced by treating target macrophages with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) particles containing viral protein X. For undifferentiated monocytes, HIV-2 particle treatment allowed undifferentiated monocytes to be fully permissive for productive infection by the macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strain. In contrast, untreated monocytes were totally resistant to HIV-1 replication. These results indicated that SAMHD1 moderately restricts even a macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strain in monocyte-derived macrophages, whereas the protein potently restricts HIV-1 replication in undifferentiated monocytes.

However, the evolution of bone mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolism during HAART has not been studied yet. In the current longitudinal study we monitored the changes of BMD and bone metabolism over a period of 12 months. Thirty-two HIV-infected children (15 girls and 17 boys), aged from 6.3 to 17.7 yr, with a long duration of HAART exposure (40.0 months at baseline) were enrolled in the study. As a control group, 381 healthy volunteers of comparable age were assessed. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine and whole skeleton by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP, as bone formation index) and N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (as bone resorption index) were measured in serum and urine, respectively. BMD values at baseline were significantly lower at all skeletal sites than those of control subjects. The annual increment of spine BMD was comparable to normal, whereas that of the whole skeleton was significantly lower (P < 0.04). BALP and N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen concentrations were significantly higher compared with controls at baseline and at follow-up. BALP annual changes of HIV patients were significantly different from normal. Our data confirm the presence of low BMD and bone metabolism derangement in HIV-infected children treated with HAART. The role of possible therapeutic approach to restore bone mass and metabolism should be assessed in pediatrics."

2762,0.005,1.0000,"Our understanding of how community-level context impacts care of persons living with HIV (PLWH), including antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and retention in care, is limited. The objective of this study was to characterize the activity spaces of PLWH from an urban area in Southeastern U.S., where the epidemic is among the nation's highest, and to examine how such activity spaces are associated with daily mood and health behaviors. In this small, pilot study, 11 participants were tracked with a global positioning system (GPS)-enabled application on their smartphones for 2 weeks. Activity spaces were created by connecting GPS points sequentially and adding buffers. Contextual exposure data (e.g., alcohol outlets) were connected to activity spaces. Participants also completed daily diary entry through texts 3 times per day regarding outcomes of substance use behaviors, mood, and medication adherence. This yielded a total of 18,007 GPS polyline records that we aggregated into 258 person-days that captured discrete occasions of exposure to contextual factors and subjects' behaviors and moods. On average, the participants spent 19% of their time awake during the 2-week periods in their residential census tract. Exposure to social and built environment factors such as alcohol outlets was greater when participants were outside versus inside their residential census tract. Exposures on daily routes were also significantly associated with ART adherence, alcohol consumption, and mood. Findings suggest substantial differences between activity spaces and residential contexts. Activity spaces are relevant for PLWH and may impact HIV care and behavioral outcomes such as ART adherence and substance use."

Advances in antiretroviral therapy, reductions in side effects, new classes and new drugs within existing antiretroviral classes offer enormous benefits, although issues around adherence during adolescence persist. The longer term impact of exposure to HIV and antiretroviral therapy throughout childhood are becoming apparent, with growing concern over neurocognitive, cardiovascular, renal and bone health. Careful follow-up of this early perinatal cohort as they enter adulthood will inform the future management of the growing numbers of adolescents surviving worldwide as access to therapy increases."

Among a predominately minority sample of 303 HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) who were either newly diagnosed with HIV or showed evidence of inconsistent engagement in HIV care, we explored rates of exposure to crime, sexual and physical trauma, and associations with factors potentially related to poor engagement in care. Two thirds of participants experienced a crime-related event, and nearly one third reported exposure to physical and/or sexual trauma. All three types of exposure were related to HIV stigma and to concerns about initiating ART. Associations between exposure and social support and HIV disclosure needs were also observed. Findings have implications for the role of trauma exposure and efforts to optimize treatment engagement for HIV-infected MSM. "
12007,0.005,1.0000,"Based on the information available, transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can and does occur in health-care settings. No cases of such transmission have been reported from an infected health-care worker to a patient. Transmission of HIV from an infected patient to a health-care worker has been documented after parenteral or mucous-membrane exposure to blood. However, this risk is less than 1%, is limited to exposure to blood, and can be further minimized through adherence to routine infection control measures. Patient-to-patient transmission through invasive equipment or through HIV-infected blood, blood products, organs, tissues, or semen also occurs but can be prevented by proper sterilization of instruments and through donor-deferral, donor screening, and heat treatment of Factors VIII or IX to inactivate the HIV. In health-care settings, prevention of HIV transmission requires education of all health-care workers and ancillary staff, provision of necessary equipment, and strict adherence to general infection control practices."
16261,0.005,1.0000,"Health care workers exposed to blood and body fluids have a low but measurable risk of occupational infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This risk is related to the prevalence of HIV among patients, the frequency of exposure to infected blood, and the method of exposure. The magnitude of risk is thus difficult to assess for any given situation, although the overall risk following percutaneous exposure is approximately 0.3%. Risk can be reduced by paying close attention to infection control procedures and by minimizing risky procedures. Exposure management should include preexposure education and immediate postexposure care and counseling. Chemoprophylaxis is widely used despite doubts as to its effectiveness, and much research is clearly needed to develop more effective prophylaxis.

Although the principles of exposure management remain unchanged, recommended HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens and the duration of HIV follow-up testing for exposed personnel have been updated. This report emphasizes the importance of primary prevention strategies, the prompt reporting and management of occupational exposures, adherence to recommended HIV PEP regimens when indicated for an exposure, expert consultation in management of exposures, follow-up of exposed HCP to improve adherence to PEP, and careful monitoring for adverse events related to treatment, as well as for virologic, immunologic, and serologic signs of infection. To ensure timely postexposure management and administration of HIV PEP, clinicians should consider occupational exposures as urgent medical concerns, and institutions should take steps to ensure that staff are aware of both the importance of and the institutional mechanisms available for reporting and seeking care for such exposures. The following is a summary of recommendations: (1) PEP is recommended when occupational exposures to HIV occur; (2) the HIV status of the exposure source patient should be determined, if possible, to guide need for HIV PEP; (3) PEP medication regimens should be started as soon as possible after occupational exposure to HIV, and they should be continued for a 4-week duration; (4) new recommendation-PEP medication regimens should contain 3 (or more) antiretroviral drugs (listed in Appendix A ) for all occupational exposures to HIV; (5) expert consultation is recommended for any occupational exposures to HIV and at a minimum for situations described in Box 1 ; (6) close follow-up for exposed personnel ( Box 2 ) should be provided that includes counseling, baseline and follow-up HIV testing, and monitoring for drug toxicity; follow-up appointments should begin within 72 hours of an HIV exposure; and (7) new recommendation-if a newer fourth-generation combination HIV p24 antigen-HIV antibody test is utilized for follow-up HIV testing of exposed HCP, HIV testing may be concluded 4 months after exposure ( Box 2 ); if a newer testing platform is not available, follow-up HIV testing is typically concluded 6 months after an HIV exposure.

Information of 110 HIV/AIDS patients from 19 provinces and cities treated with TCM from 2004 to 2013 was collected. Changes in the indexes of CD4 counts ( ≤ 200, 201-350, 351-500 and > 500 cells/mm(3)) at five time points (0, 12, 36, 60 and 84 months) and different treatments [TCM and TCM plus antiretroviral therapy (ART)] were compared. Repeated measures test indicated no interaction between group and time (P > 0.05). Degrees of increasing and decreasing CD4 count of the two groups at four different frames were statistically significant compared with the baseline. The CD4 count between the two groups was not statistically significant. For CD4 count of ≤ 200 cells/mm(3), the mean CD4 count changes were 21 and 28 cells/mm(3) per year for the TCM group and TCM plus ART group, respectively. For CD4 count of 201-350 cells/mm(3), the mean CD4 count changes were 6 and 25 cells/mm(3) per year for the TCM group and TCM plus ART group, respectively.

7952,0.005,1.0000,"Repertoire composition, quantity, and qualitative functional ability are the parameters that define virus-specific T-cell responses and are linked with their potential to control infection. We took advantage of the segregation of different hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes in geographically and genetically distinct host populations to directly analyze the impact that host and virus variables exert on these virus-specific T-cell parameters. T-cell responses against the entire HBV proteome were analyzed in a total of 109 HBV-infected subjects of distinct ethnicities (47 of Chinese origin and 62 of Caucasian origin). We demonstrate that HBV-specific T-cell quantity is determined by the virological and clinical profiles of the patients, which outweigh any influence of race or viral diversity. In contrast, HBV-specific T-cell repertoires are divergent in the two ethnic groups, with T-cell epitopes frequently found in Caucasian patients seldom detected in Chinese patients. In conclusion, we provide a direct biological evaluation of the impact that host and virus variables exert on virus-specific T-cell responses. The discordance between HBV-specific CD8 T-cell repertoires present in Caucasian and Chinese subjects shows the ability of HLA micropolymorphisms to diversify T-cell responses and has implications for the rational development of therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines for worldwide use."

We use qualitative methods in 12 focus groups (n = 113) of adults who self-reported their ethnicity to be Chinese, Korean, or Vietnamese. We use grounded theory (i.e., consensus-building between co-coders about recurring, emerging themes) for analysis. Diet, nutrition, fatigue and stress were misidentified as HBV causes. Improving hygiene, diet, exercise, and holistic methods were misidentified as viable HBV prevention methods. Common screening problems included not affording test and not understanding test results. Participants shared reasons for using complementary and alternative medicine--when Western medicine fails or becomes unaffordable. Participants sought information from medical providers and fellow community members, but also from the internet. Many of the attitudes and opinions that emerged may deter participation in HBV screening, prevention and treatment, insofar as community members may factor them into healthcare decision-making, choose alternative but ineffective methods of prevention and treatment, and undervalue the benefits of screening. More patient education in both traditional and new media is necessary for clarifying transmission, screening and treatment misunderstandings."

In 18 patients receiving prednisolone, serum HBV DNA levels rose during the course of therapy, but dropped abruptly within 1 month of cessation of treatment. Conversely, their serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels decreased during high doses of prednisolone therapy, and then became transiently elevated during the period of withdrawal of prednisolone. At 1 year from initial treatment, the serum HBV DNA and ALT levels were similar between the groups of patients treated with prednisolone or placebo.

Clinical and biological data were collected every 3 months. Predictors for survival were identified using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models. A 2-slope-mixed linear model was used to estimate MELD score changes as a function of survival.Sixty seven patients were included in 32 centers between 2009 and 2012 (72% male; median age: 48 years [interquartile ratio (IQR):45-52], median follow-up: 22.4 months [range: 0.5-65.3]). Overall survival rates were 86%, 78%, and 59% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Under multivariate analysis, the MELD score at initial decompensation was predictive of survival, adjusted for age, type of decompensation, baseline CD4 counts, and further decompensation during follow-up as a time-dependent variable. The adjusted hazard ratio of death was 1.32 for a score 3 points higher (95% CI: [1.06-1.63], P = 0.012). MELD score kinetics within the 6 months after initial decompensation differed significantly between non-deceased and deceased patients, with a decreased (-0.49/month; P = 0.016), versus a flat (+0.06/month, P = 0.753) mean change in score.MELD is an effective tool to predict survival in HIV+/HCV+ patients with decompensated cirrhosis. A non-decreasing MELD score within 6 months following this initial decompensation episode may benefit from privileged access to liver transplantation in this poor prognosis population."

The primary barriers were prioritization of drug use; low level of disease-specific knowledge; stigmatization; accessibility of testing, results and treatment; and psychological factors. The primary facilitator was interest in promoting one's health. Our findings indicate that injection drug using women experience multiple barriers to HIV and hepatitis testing, results, treatment and vaccination. Methods for improving the motivators for health, facilitating infectious disease prevention, and decreasing unnecessary disease complications of injection drug using women need to be utilized.

The seroprevalence was highest for EBV (99%), followed in decreasing order by CMV (95%), HHV-6 (26%), and HTLV-1 (0.6%). The VDRL was positive in 15% of patients. The highest seroprevalence to HHV-6 was noted in the Chinese (33%) and the lowest in the Laotian hilltribes, the Mien and Hmong (14%). Antibody to HHV-6 was most prevalent among patients under 20 and those between 60 and 69 years of age. Differences were not found among ethnic groups in the seroprevalence of HTLV-1, EBV, or CMV."
11794,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the potential benefits of directly administered antiretroviral therapy (DAART) in HIV-infected former injecting drug users (ex-IDUs) admitted to residential drug rehabilitation facilities. We compared 106 of these patients consecutively admitted in 12 communities where DAART was administered (DAART group) to two matched control groups of ex-IDUs undergoing self-administered ART: 106 subjects in other 10 communities (SAT group) and 106 outpatients at hospital infectious-disease wards where community patients were referred after discharge (OUT group). We estimated the proportion of patients with high adherence and the hazard ratio (HR) of 20% or more increase in the CD4(+) cell count and of reaching an undetectable viral load. The proportion of patients with high adherence to treatment was highest in the DAART group. The probability of 20% or more increase in the CD4(+) cell count was significantly lower in the two control groups versus the DAART group (SAT group HR=0.32; OUT group HR=0.43). The HR of observing an undetectable HIV-RNA level versus DAART was significantly lower in the OUT group (HR: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-0.97) but did not reach statistical significance for the SAT group (HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.74-1.33). Our findings after a 24-month follow-up, suggest that DAART in HIV-infected patients of drug-rehabilitation communities improves adherence, immunologic, and virologic outcome toward free outpatients. Even if our retrospective 36-month data do not show a prolonged viral suppression in these patients, DAART may be considered a valuable therapeutic and educational strategy in this particular target group."
6802,0.005,1.0000,"Interleukin (IL)28B polymorphisms are associated with spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and response to therapy. Whether IL28B genotype affects fibrosis progression or clinical outcome is unclear. Our aim was to study the relationship between IL28B genotype and both histological and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Hepatic fibrosis was scored using the Ishak (0-6) scale; progression was defined as a 2-point increase in Ishak score between biopsies. Multiple logistic and Cox regressions were used to identify variables associated with fibrosis progression. In all, 1,483 patients were included in a baseline cross-sectional analysis, from which 276 were eligible for a paired biopsy analysis (median time between biopsies 4 years), and 400 for a clinical outcome analysis. At baseline biopsy, patients with IL28B CC genotype had significantly higher portal inflammation (2.4 versus 2.2) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (133 versus 105 U/L; P < 0.05 for all). In the paired biopsy analysis, there was no difference in the frequency of fibrosis progression between patients with IL28B CC and non-CC genotypes (17% versus 23%). In logistic regression, only higher baseline alkaline phosphatase, lower platelets, and greater hepatic steatosis were associated with fibrosis progression. Patients with IL28B CC were twice as likely to develop adverse clinical outcomes compared to non-CC (32% versus 16%; P = 0.007)."
17900,0.005,1.0000,"Although empirical information on resource use during HIV infection is vital to improving quality of care, the issues involved in conducting research on resource use have received little attention in the medical literature. The purpose of this paper is to review the theoretical and methodological issues of conducting research on health care utilization patterns among persons with HIV/AIDS. Conceptual definitions of utilization are compared and contrasted. Three theoretical frameworks, the Andersen Behavioral Model, the Health Belief Model, and the Biopsychosocial Model are described to illustrate their applicability in future research studies. Research designs, measurement considerations, sampling approaches, and existing data sources on utilization are reviewed. Recommendations for health care utilization research are summarized and highlight the importance of designing studies and generating data for investigation of the factors facilitating patients' use of an optimal array of services including prevention, long-term, and rehabilitation care."

We conducted behavioral and biological sexual health surveys with 300 MSW in Ho Chi Minh City. Generalized estimating equation models were built to assess factors associated with HIV, hepatitis C, and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Of 300 MSW, 19 (6.3 %) were diagnosed seropositive for HIV, 11 (3.7 %) had hepatitis C, and 26 (8.7 %) had at least one prevalent STI. In a multivariable model, opiate use was significantly associated with HIV infection (aOR 6.46, 95 % CI 1.28-32.7) and hepatitis C (aOR = 19.6, 95 % CI 2.35-163.6).

These findings suggest that MSW in Vietnam would benefit from regular HIV and STI testing, as well as linkage to care and substance use rehabilitation services. "
10801,0.005,1.0000,"A depressed level of natural killer (NK) activity is one of the various immunologic abnormalities in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Interleukin-15 (IL-15), an immunotherapeutic candidate in HIV infection, increases NK activity and induces the excretion of CC-chemokines from divergent immune cells, but the mechanisms of NK activity enhancement by IL-15 stimulation is not clearly established in HIV infection. This study examined whether CC-chemokines, which are known to increase NK activity, are secreted adequately in HIV-infected individuals, and also investigated whether P-glycoprotein is involved in NK activity enhancement after IL-15 administration. NK activity increased with IL-15 stimulation in NK cells of HIV-infected individuals, as it does in normal NK cells. IL-15 stimulates NK cells to secrete CC-chemokines, such as, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), macrophage chemotactic protein-1alpha (MCP-1alpha) and regulated upon activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) in both HIV-infected individuals and controls with no significant difference. P-glycoprotein expression and function is decreased in HIV-infected individuals and restored only in NK cells of HIV-infected individuals after IL-15 stimulation. P-glycoprotein may play a role in the mechanism of increased NK cell activity in HIV-infected individuals after IL-15 stimulation."
11370,0.005,1.0000,"Interleukin 8 (IL-8) is a chemokine produced by macrophages and other cell types, including epithelial cells, and its receptor is CXCR2. IL-8 plays an important role in the initiation and amplification of inflammatory diseases, including opportunistic infections. With the advent of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, opportunistic infections have become major health concerns. However, the role of host genetics on the occurrence of these infections has not been clearly defined. In this study, genomic DNA was extracted from 185 HIV-infected individuals in the Limpopo Province, South Africa. Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to genotype the CXCR2 +1208 T/C gene. Genotypes CC, TT, and TC were associated with chest pains, frequent headaches, loss of weight, diarrhea, and loss of appetite among HIV patients. A significant association between the CC genotype and chest pains was found (P=0.035). The TC genotype was associated with loss of appetite (P=0.044) and chest pains (P=0.042). A weak association between diarrhea and the TT genotype was found (P=0.082). No association was observed between tuberculosis and the genotypes. Immunological characteristics, such as viral load and CD4 count, were not significantly associated with the genotypes. The results of the present study suggest that carriers of the TC genotype are more susceptible to chest pain, but that this genotype confers a protective effect against loss of appetite. The CC genotype was found to confer protection against chest pain but appeared to increase susceptibility to headaches. Further studies using larger samples are necessary to confirm these results."
11851,0.005,1.0000,"Neuronal injury, dendritic loss and brain atrophy are frequent complications of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1. Activated brain macrophages and microglia can release quinolinic acid, a neurotoxin and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor agonist, which we hypothesize contributes to neuronal injury and cerebral volume loss. In the present cross-sectional study of 94 HIV-1-infected patients, elevated CSF quinolinic acid concentrations correlated with worsening brain atrophy, quantified by MRI, in regions vulnerable to excitotoxic injury (the striatum and limbic cortex) but not in regions relatively resistant to excitotoxicity (the non-limbic cortex, thalamus and white matter). Increased CSF quinolinic acid concentrations also correlated with higher CSF HIV-1 RNA levels. In support of the specificity of these associations, blood levels of quinolinic acid were unrelated to striatal and limbic volumes, and CSF levels of beta(2)-microglobulin, a non-specific and non-excitotoxic marker of immune activation, were unrelated to regional brain volume loss. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that quinolinic acid accumulation in brain tissue contributes to atrophy in vulnerable brain regions in HIV infection and that virus replication is a significant driver of local quinolinic acid biosynthesis."

Twenty-one treatment periods, 13 after initiation of zidovudine and 8 after initiation of didanosine, were studied. During zidovudine treatment, CSF HIV RNA levels decreased by a mean of 1.05 log10 (-91%, P < .01), and CSF neopterin and beta2-microglobulin levels by 57% and 33%, respectively (P < .01). No reduction was seen during didanosine treatment in CSF HIV RNA (+0.13 log10, not significant), CSF neopterin, or beta2-microglobulin levels. Changes in CSF HIV RNA levels correlated with changes in CSF neopterin and beta2-microglobulin (r(s) = .81 and .83, respectively, P < .001). The decrease in HIV RNA was significantly larger in CSF than in serum following zidovudine treatment (P < .01).

As a group, anaesthetists in training were more concerned than consultants about the risk of HIV or HBV infection and, as a consequence, were more likely to adopt protective measures. A similar variation was seen with age, younger anaesthetists being more concerned about the risk of infection and adopting preventive measures in greater numbers than their older colleagues. The sex of the anaesthetist had minimal effect on their attitude. Despite the marked variation in the incidence of both HIV and HBV, the attitude of anaesthetists to the risk of infection and the numbers adopting simple preventive measures did not vary significantly on a regional basis throughout the country. However, there was a significant inter-regional variation in the availability and uptake of HBV immunisation (p < 0.01) and knowledge of the existence of local policy guidelines for the management of known HIV or HBV positive patients (p < 0.01)."

To determine the source of this virus, levels of HIV RNA and DNA from lymphoid tissues and levels of viral RNA in serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and genital secretions in 28 patients treated for < or =2.5 years with indinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine were examined. Both HIV RNA and DNA remained detectable in all lymph nodes. In contrast, HIV RNA was not detected in 20 of 23 genital secretions or in any of 13 CSF samples after 2 years of treatment. HIV envelope sequence data from plasma and lymph nodes from 4 patients demonstrated sequence divergence, which suggests varying degrees of residual viral replication in 3 and absence in 1 patient. In patients receiving potent antiretroviral therapy, the greatest virus burden may continue to be in lymphoid tissues rather than in central nervous system or genitourinary compartments."

Forty-four (38.6%) of the patients met our criteria for abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); another 13 (11.4%) had borderline elevations of nucleated cells or protein and could not be definitely classified as having normal or abnormal CSF. No significant differences existed between the patients with normal and abnormal CSF with regard to age; sex; race; serum FTA-Abs; clinical staging; absolute T helper lymphocyte counts; or cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma, or Epstein-Barr virus serologies. Seventy-two percent of the patients with abnormal CSF had evidence of possible viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS), as evidenced by increased CSF IgG, increased IgG synthesis rates, or the presence of oligoclonal bands. We found that a significant percentage of asymptomatic patients with apparent early HIV infections have abnormal CSF that is possibly due to CNS involvement by HIV."

It is also known that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients often show poor immunologic responses to immunization. We examined whether the use of GM-CSF could augment the immunologic response to recombinant vaccine against the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 80 HIV infected patients (18-35 years old). They received a double dose (40 microg) of recombinant HBV vaccine IM at 0, 1 and 6 months and were randomized to receive either concurrent 20 microg of GM-CSF (n=40) or placebo IM (n=40) with the first vaccine dose. A significant increase in the seroconversion rate was observed after the second vaccine dose in the GM-CSF group (62% GM-CSF versus 30% control group P<0.0074). The average anti-HBs titers measured on days 28, 60 and 210 were 40.3; 366.5 and 644.8 milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/ml), respectively, in the GM-CSF group, and 62.4; 166.4 and 375.0 mIU/ml, respectively, in the control group, with significant differences at 60 and 210 days (P<0.01). There were no significant differences between CD4/CD8 cells, viral load, risk factors, age, sex and the serological responses to the HBV vaccine. This study suggests that GM-CSF increases the immunogenicity of recombinant HBV vaccine in HIV infected individuals."

A possible strategy to eliminate cellular reservoirs in long-lived, HIV-1-infected quiescent CD4(+) T-lymphocytes might be to add T-cell-activating agents to potent antiretroviral therapy. In this report we describe a patient with Guillain-Barré syndrome treated with high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in addition to antiretroviral therapy. A transiently increased viral load and immunoactivation during the IVIG treatment suggest activation of latently infected cells and increased turnover rate of the latent viral reservoir. HIV replication was controlled with plasma viral load <20 copies/ml, for at least 3 months after antiretroviral treatment interruption. CSF neural markers reflecting degenerative processes in the brain during the symptomatic period and follow-up were also analysed. Very high CSF sulfatide concentrations were found indicating that the pathology involves severe demyelination.We hypothesize that IVIG in this case contributed to an activation of latently infected cells, which led to a transient increase in plasma HIV-1 RNA during the IVIG treatment and a long period of undetectable viral load after antiretroviral treatment interruption. Further, this is the first time, to our knowledge, that detailed CSF findings are described in HIV-1 associated GBS."
15372,0.005,1.0000,"The impact of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection on the long-term outcome of kidney transplant patients is controversial. A total of 34 chronic hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers among 143 renal allograft recipients were identified in this study (mean follow-up period: 5.6+/-3.3 years; range: 1-13 years). During the follow-up, one HBsAg-positive recipient with preexisting cirrhosis died of liver failure, and seven (21%) others developed serious HBV-related complications (four fulminant hepatitis, two hepatocellular carcinoma, one cirrhosis), and four died. Although HBsAg-positive recipients had a higher rate of liver-related complications and deaths than HBsAg-negative recipients did, there were no significant differences in the long-term graft and patient survival between the two groups. The survival rates, liver-related complications, and deaths in HBsAg-positive allograft recipients and 28 HBsAg-positive uremic patients under dialysis were similar. In conclusion, HBV infection is not a contraindication to kidney transplantation. However, pretransplant candidates should be warned of potentially serious liver-related complications."
7556,0.005,1.0000,"A variety of clinical syndromes, including AIDS and neurological disorders, may follow as a consequence of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). It is not yet clear, however, to what extent the destruction of lymphocytes and neural cells associated with these conditions is caused by adverse immune responses to HIV-1 or how much is due to cytopathic effects of the virus itself. Here we document the existence of HLA-restricted, HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid of two AIDS patients manifesting neurologic disorders. These cytotoxic T lymphocytes showed dual specificity, recognizing target cells coated with purified HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp 120) or inactivated HIV-1 in the context of HLA antigens. Cytotoxic T-cell clones derived from one of the AIDS patients revealed restriction specificities representing both HLA class I and HLA class II antigens. Considerable phenotypic heterogeneity was observed amongst these clones, some expressing conventional combinations of cytotoxic T-cell surface markers, and others displaying unusual phenotypes. The presence of HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in AIDS patients, and in particular in their cerebrospinal fluid, suggests that these cytotoxic effectors may participate in the lymphoid cell and/or neurologic damage observed in such patients."
1967,0.005,1.0000,"We noticed considerable variation in anxiety among staff reporting blood exposure incidents and therefore undertook a study to investigate this. We studied 100 consecutive staff reporting blood or other body fluid exposures to the Occupational Health Unit. The nurse seeing the staff member administered a questionnaire about worries related to the incident, knowledge of HIV and hepatitis B transmission risks, perception of risk from the particular incident and predicted reaction of others that would be told. Level of anxiety was recorded on a visual analogue scale. Staff were then given information and counselling as usual, and asked to re-attend after a week, when the questionnaire was repeated. We found that the initial level of anxiety was not related to knowledge of HIV or hepatitis B transmission risks, but was related to perception of risk from the incident and to predicted reaction of others that would be told. The eight staff involved in exposures to known HIV-infected blood were not more anxious than the remainder. There was a reduction in anxiety between visits, which was significantly greater in women, in those who had a non-parental exposure and in those where the source patient was known. Knowledge of transmission risks also improved significantly between visits. This study underlines the importance of adequate counselling of staff who have suffered blood exposures."

The joint diseases were of the polyarthritis and acute oligoarthritis types, affecting mainly the knees and ankles but also the wrist and fingers; the spine was involved in one case. The synovial fluid present in 4 patients contained 5,000 to 27,000 cells per cubic millimeter, with a strong predominance of polymorphonuclears. In 3 cases, infective viral particles were found in the fluid with anti-HIV antibodies. In 2 patients biopsy of the synovial membrane provided evidence of non-specific subacute synovitis. All X-ray films, including those of the sacro-iliac joint, were and remained normal. The course of the joint disease was acute and regressive in 5 cases, chronic and prolonged in the remaining 5 cases. In 5 patients the arthropathies were the first clinical manifestations of the HIV infection. Three patients who had stage IV C AIDS died; the others were in stages II (5), III (1) or IV E (1) and did not progress to a more severe stage. This study shows that various types of inflammatory arthritis may occur in HIV positive patients. In most cases the arthritis is reactive, but certain data suggest that it may be directly related to the virus in some patients."
6805,0.005,1.0000,"Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) promotes macrophage differentiation, increases susceptibility of macrophages to viral infection, and enhances human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in infected macrophages. Given the current model of HIV neuropathogenesis, which involves monocyte trafficking into the central nervous system, immune factors linked with macrophage maturation and survival may be associated with cognitive decline (measured by neuropsychological z-score [NPZ-8] or Memorial Sloan-Kettering [MSK] score) and alterations in a marker of neuronal integrity, N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Fifty-four chronically infected HIV+ subjects underwent neuropsychological assessment, magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, and quantification of M-CSF in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at baseline. Thirty-nine of those subjects underwent further examination at 3 and 10 months after initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens. Within 3 months of therapy use, CSF M-CSF and viral RNA levels were reduced, whereas NAA concentrations in many brain regions were increased. Neither baseline levels nor the change in M-CSF levels had the ability to predict changes in NAA levels observed after 10 months of combination ART use. At study entry those with the lowest M-CSF levels in the CSF had the least cognitive impairment (NPZ-8). Those who had higher baseline CSF M-CSF levels and exhibited larger decreases in M-CSF after therapy, tended to have greater cognitive improvement after 10 months. Increased prevalence of M-CSF in the setting of HIV infection could contribute to neuronal injury and may be predictive of cognitive impairment."
7798,0.005,1.0000,"Numerous studies published in the past two decades have identified the viral protein R (Vpr) as one of the most versatile proteins in the life cycle of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In this regard, more than a thousand Vpr molecules are present in extracellular viral particles. Subsequent to viral entry, Vpr participates in early replicative events by assisting in viral genome nuclear import and, during the viral life cycle, by shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm to accomplish its functions within the context of other replicative functions. Additionally, several studies have implicated Vpr as a proapoptotic protein because it promotes formation of permeability transition pores in mitochondria, which in turn affects transmembrane potential and adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Recent studies have identified Vpr as a virion-free protein in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients infected with HIV-1 whose plasma viremia directly correlates with the extracellular concentration of Vpr. These observations pointed to a new role for Vpr as an additional weapon in the HIV-1 arsenal, involving the use of an extracellular protein to target and possibly inhibit HIV-1-uninfected bystander cells to enable them to escape immune surveillance. In addition, extracellular Vpr decreases adenosine triphosphate levels and affects the intracellular redox balance in neurons, ultimately causing their apoptosis. Herein, we review the role of Vpr as an extracellular protein and its downstream effects on cellular metabolism, functionality, and survival, with particular emphasis on how extracellular Vpr-induced oxidative stress might aggravate HIV-1-induced symptoms, thus affecting pathogenesis and disease progression."
11933,0.005,1.0000,"HIV infection treatment strategies have historically defined effectiveness through measuring patient plasma HIV RNA. While combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) can reduce plasma viral load (pVL) to undetectable levels, the degree that HIV is eliminated from other anatomical sites remains unclear. We investigated the HIV DNA levels in 229 varied autopsy tissues from 20 HIV-positive (HIV(+)) cART-treated study participants with low or undetectable plasma VL and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VL prior to death who were enrolled in the National Neurological AIDS Bank (NNAB) longitudinal study and autopsy cohort. Extensive medical histories were obtained for each participant. Autopsy specimens, including at least six brain and nonbrain tissues per participant, were reviewed by study pathologists. HIV DNA, measured in tissues by quantitative and droplet digital PCR, was identified in 48/87 brain tissues and 82/142 nonbrain tissues at levels >200 HIV copies/million cell equivalents. No participant was found to be completely free of tissue HIV. Parallel sequencing studies from some tissues recovered intact HIV DNA and RNA. Abnormal histological findings were identified in all participants, especially in brain, spleen, lung, lymph node, liver, aorta, and kidney. All brain tissues demonstrated some degree of pathology. Ninety-five percent of participants had some degree of atherosclerosis, and 75% of participants died with cancer. This study assists in characterizing the anatomical locations of HIV, in particular, macrophage-rich tissues, such as the central nervous system (CNS) and testis. Additional studies are needed to determine if the HIV recovered from tissues promotes the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, cancer, and atherosclerosis."
9103,0.005,1.0000,"The role of Human Leukocytic Antigen (HLA) antigens in susceptibility to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is still being debated. We analyzed HLA phenotype frequencies in two major ethnic groups, namely Egyptian and Saudi nationals. The Egyptian group included 110 patients of whom 55 were HCV positive and the other 55 HCV negative (control group). The Saudi group included 146 HCV positive patients and 122 HCV negative individuals (control group). The results for the Egyptian population revealed increased frequencies of some HLA phenotypes and decreased frequencies of others but without any statistically significant difference. In contrast, in the Saudi population, the HLA-A19 phenotype was significantly increased in HCV positive patients when compared with the control group while significantly decreased frequencies were found for HLA-B8, HLA-DRI and HLA DR3. Our data suggest that there was no significant association between HLA phenotypes and susceptibility to HCV infection among the Egyptian population while the overall data of the Saudi population seem to indicate that the expression of particular HLA alleles could be associated with susceptibility or resistance to the HCV infection. Further studies on larger numbers of patients are needed to support the role of the HLA system in HCV infection. A total of 108 HCV positive patients underwent renal transplantation at the Jeddah Kidney Center and the results were compared with 100 age and sex-matched controls. Graft survival at 36 months was 82% and 86% for HCV positive and control subjects respectively while patient survival was respectively 90% and 91%. Our data suggest that the outcome, at least in the Short-time, of renal transplantation in HCV positive patients is very good."
9436,0.005,1.0000,"Like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) invades and infects the central nervous system (CNS) soon after peripheral infection. The appearance of viral RNA is particularly prominent in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), suggesting an efficient route of virus transfer across the blood-CSF barrier. This raises the concern whether this route can establish a stable viral reservoir and also be a source of virus capable of reseeding peripheral systems. To examine this possibility, 200 mul of cell-free NCSU1 FIV or FIV-infected choroid plexus macrophages (ChP-Mac) was directly injected into the right lateral ventricle of the brain. Negative controls were sham inoculated with uninfected ChP-Mac or virus-free culture supernatant and positive controls were infected systemically by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) inoculation with cell-free FIV resulted in high levels of plasma FIV RNA detected as early as 1 to 2 weeks post inoculation in all cats. In each case, the plasma viremia preceded the detection of CSF viral RNA. Compared to i.p. cats, i.c.v. cats had 32-fold higher CSF viral loads, 8-fold higher ratios of CSF to plasma viral load, and a 23-fold greater content of FIV proviral DNA in the brain. No FIV RNA was detected in plasma or CSF from the cats inoculated with FIV-infected ChP-Mac but an acute inflammatory response and a slight suppression of the CD4+:CD8+ ratio were observed. These results indicate that free FIV circulating in the CSF promotes infection of the CNS and provides a highly efficient pathway for the transfer of infectious virus to the periphery."

Antiviral treatment may be of benefit in selected patients with recurrent hepatitis B post-LT. The aim of this prospective open-label study is to determine the safety and efficacy of lamivudine in 33 liver transplant recipients with active HBV infection. The median time from LT to study enrollment was 51 months, all patients were hepatitis B surface antigen positive, and 75% and 94% of subjects had detectable hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and HBV DNA at entry, respectively. The median duration of lamivudine treatment on study was 85 weeks, during which time median HBV DNA levels became undetectable by 16 weeks and 9% of patients lost previously detectable HBeAg. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels improved in most patients and normalized in 27% of patients with elevated values pretreatment. Serum bilirubin and albumin levels significantly improved in patients with abnormal values at entry (P <.05). Virological breakthrough was detected in 13 subjects after a median of 61 weeks of lamivudine treatment and was confirmed to be caused by YMDD mutants in all patients tested. None of the patients with virological breakthrough showed a complete loss of clinical response to lamivudine. Serum ALT and bilirubin levels in patients with and without virological breakthrough were not significantly different at last study follow-up. Study results show that lamivudine is safe and effective in liver transplant recipients with recurrent hepatitis B. However, the high rate of virological breakthrough with prolonged therapy indicates the need for further studies of combination antiviral therapy in this patient population. Our results and others further establish the improving long-term outcomes with LT for patients with hepatitis B through advances in prevention of reinfection, as well as the availability of safe and effective antiviral therapies to treat patients with HBV recurrence."
16708,0.005,1.0000,"A group of 76 consecutive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with fever of unknown origin (n = 52) or fever associated with pulmonary diseases was evaluated in order to assess the usefulness of PCR with peripheral blood in the diagnosis and follow-up of visceral leishmaniasis. We identified 10 cases of visceral leishmaniasis among the 52 patients with fever of unknown origin. At the time of diagnosis, all were parasitemic by PCR with peripheral blood. During follow-up, a progressive decline in parasitemia was observed under therapy, and all patients became PCR negative after a median of 5 weeks (range, 6 to 21 weeks). However, in eight of nine patients monitored for a median period of 88 weeks (range, 33 to 110 weeks), visceral leishmaniasis relapsed, with positive results by PCR with peripheral blood reappearing 1 to 2 weeks before the clinical onset of disease. Eight Leishmania infantum and two Leishmania donovani infections were identified by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. PCR with peripheral blood is a reliable method for diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-infected patients. During follow-up, it substantially reduces the need for traditional invasive tests to assess parasitological response, while a positive PCR result is predictive of clinical relapse."
3626,0.005,1.0000,"Recently the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and the association between these genotypes and the clinical status of HBV-infected patients were recently investigated in the Lebanese population. The aim of the additional study reported here was to determine the current prevalence of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection and the range of HDV genotypes in this Lebanese population. Two hundred and fifty-eight HBsAg-positive patients (107 asymptomatic blood donors, 92 with chronic hepatitis, 24 with cirrhosis, 15 with hepatocellular carcinoma, 20 patients on haemodialysis) from ten medical centers in Lebanon were tested for antibody to hepatitis D virus (anti-HDV). Those testing positive were analysed further for HDV-RNA and for genotyping by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Three samples (1.2%) were anti-HDV positive and out of these, only one was HDV-RNA positive (0.6%) and was analysed as HDV genotype I. Our results point to a low endemicity of HDV in the Lebanese population which is in sharp contrast to data reported from Lebanon 20 years ago and to the situation in neighbouring Arab and non-Arab countries in the Mediterranean region. HDV genotype I seems to be the predominant genotype in Lebanon and the Middle East."

A total of 139 antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected adults with active TB were prospectively enrolled to receive efavirenz 600 mg-tenofovir 300 mg-lamivudine 300 mg. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CYP2B6 were genotyped. Seven SNPs, including 64C→T, 499C→G, 516G→T, 785A→G, 1375A→G, 1459C→T, and 21563C→T, were included for CYP2B6 haplotype determination. The CYP2B6 18492T→C polymorphism was studied in 48 patients who carried haplotype *1/*1. At 12 and 24 weeks after antiretroviral therapy, plasma efavirenz concentrations at 12 h after dosing were measured. Plasma HIV RNA was monitored every 12 weeks for 96 weeks. Of 48 patients {body weight [mean±standard deviation (SD)], 56±10 kg}, 77% received a rifampin-containing anti-TB regimen. No drug resistance-associated mutation was detected at baseline. The frequencies of the wild type (18492TT) and the heterozygous (18492TC) and homozygous (18492CC) mutants of the CYP2B6 18492T→C polymorphism were 39%, 42%, and 19%, respectively. At 12 weeks, mean (±SD) efavirenz concentrations of patients who carried the 18492TT, 18492TC, and 18492CC mutants were 2.8±1.6, 1.7±0.9, and 1.4±0.5 mg/liter, respectively (P=0.005). At 24 weeks, the efavirenz concentrations of the corresponding groups were 2.4±0.8, 1.7±0.8, and 1.2±0.4 mg/liter, respectively (P=0.003). A low efavirenz concentration was independently associated with 18492T→C (β=-0.937, P=0.004) and high body weight (β=-0.032, P=0.046). At 96 weeks, 19%, 17%, and 28% of patients carrying the 18492TT, 18492TC, and 18492CC mutants, respectively, had plasma HIV RNA levels of >40 copies/ml and developed efavirenz-associated mutations (P=0.254). In summary, the CYP2B6 18492T→C polymorphism compromises efavirenz concentrations in patients who carry CYP2B6 haplotype *1/*1 and are coinfected with HIV and tuberculosis."
13065,0.005,1.0000,"It has been reported that hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA is present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), although it is unclear whether it actually replicates there or is adsorbed from serum. HBV DNA sequences from the core promoter and precore regions were amplified from PBMCs and serum taken from 13 patients with hepatitis B infection. Analysis by single strand conformation polymorphism, direct sequencing and cloning revealed identical HBV DNA sequences in both PBMCs and serum from five patients with acute hepatitis and in five out of eight patients with chronic hepatitis. However, in the remaining three chronic hepatitis cases, HBV DNA sequences in both PBMCs and serum were different: two patients harboured HBV DNA sequences from their PBMCs with deletions/insertions in the core promoter region and one patient harboured HBV DNA sequences from their PBMCs with two nucleotide substitutions. These findings point to a possible presence of independent HBV DNA replication in PBMCs."
8224,0.005,1.0000,"To evaluate the associations of HPA polymorphisms -1, -3, and -5 with HIV/HCV coinfection were included in this study 60 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients from the Sao Paulo State health service centers. Data reported by Verdichio-Moraes et al. (2009: J. Med Virol 81:757-759) were used as the non-infected and HCV monoinfected groups. Human Platelet Polymorphism genotyping was performed in 60 Patients co-infected with HIV/HCV by PCR-SSP or PCR-RFLP. HIV subtyping and HCV genotyping was performed by RT-PCR followed sequencing. The data analyses were performed using the χ2 test or Fisher's Exact Test and the logistic regression model. Patients coinfected with HIV/HCV presented HCV either genotype 1 (78.3%) or non-1 (21.7%) and HIV either subtype B (85.0%) or non-B (15%). The Human Platelet Polymorphism-1a/1b genotype was more frequent (P < 0.05) in HIV/HCV coinfection than in HCV monoinfection and the allelic frequency of Human Platelet Polymorphism-5b in the Patients coinfected with HIV/HCV was higher (P < 0.05) than in HCV monoinfected cases and non-infected individuals. These data suggest that the presence of specific HPA allele on platelets could favor the existence of coinfection. On the other hand, Human Platelet Polymorphism-5a/5b was more frequent (P < 0.05) in HIV/HCV coinfected and HCV monoinfected groups than in the non-infected individuals, suggesting that this platelet genotype is related to HCV infection, regardless of HIV presence. Results suggest that the Human Platelet Polymorphism profile in HIV/HCV coinfected individuals differs from the one of both HCV monoinfected and non-infected population. So, the Human Platelet Polymorphism can be a genetic marker associated with HIV/HCV coinfection."
8477,0.005,1.0000,"Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has bactericidal and virocidal effects. Although NO synthesis and iNOS expression in macrophages affect several aspects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type-1 pathogenesis, their role in HIV disease remains largely unknown. In humans, the expression of iNOS is influenced by a functional CCTTT-repeat polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene. We investigated the association of this polymorphism with HIV pathogenesis in naive HIV-infected patients before the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. The allele frequencies of the iNOS CCTTT-repeat polymorphism were assessed by PCR in 857 patients from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, including rapid progressors and long-term nonprogressors, and in 240 healthy volunteers. In HIV-infected patients, the initial viral load and the decline in total CD4 cells was calculated to estimate disease progression. Allele frequencies of the iNOS CCTTT-repeat polymorphism were similar between the HIV-infected and noninfected blood donors. In treatment-naive HIV-positive patients, there was no association of the iNOS polymorphism with viral load or with the course of CD4 cells. Regulation of iNOS expression by the functional CCTTT-polymorphism does not modify HIV pathogenesis."
11178,0.005,1.0000,"The innate antiviral factor TRIM5alpha restricts the replication of some retroviruses through its interaction with the viral capsid protein, leading to abortive infection. While overexpression of human TRIM5alpha results in modest restriction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), this inhibition is insufficient to block productive infection of human cells. We hypothesized that polymorphisms within TRIM5 may result in increased restriction of HIV-1 infection. We sequenced the TRIM5 gene (excluding exon 5) and the 4.8-kb 5' putative regulatory region in genomic DNA from 110 HIV-1-infected subjects and 96 exposed seronegative persons, along with targeted gene sequencing in a further 30 HIV-1-infected individuals. Forty-eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 20 with allele frequencies of >1.0%, were identified. Among these were two synonymous and eight nonsynonymous coding polymorphisms. We observed no association between TRIM5 polymorphism in HIV-1-infected subjects and their set-point viral load after acute infection, although one TRIM5 haplotype was weakly associated with more rapid CD4(+) T-cell loss. Importantly, a TRIM5 haplotype containing the nonsynonymous SNP R136Q showed increased frequency among HIV-1-infected subjects relative to exposed seronegative persons, with an odds ratio of 5.49 (95% confidence interval = 1.83 to 16.45; P = 0.002). Nonetheless, we observed no effect of individual TRIM5alpha nonsynonymous mutations on the in vitro HIV-1 susceptibility of CD4(+) T cells. Therefore, any effect of TRIM5alpha polymorphism on HIV-1 infection in primary lymphocytes may depend on combinations of SNPs or on DNA sequences in linkage disequilibrium with the TRIM5alpha coding sequence."
16423,0.005,1.0000,"The northeast of Gabon, central Africa is characterized by high population density and a high rate of immigration from the surrounding countries. To determine the prevalence, circulating subtypes, and antiretroviral resistance mutations of HIV-1, 810 blood samples were collected from the general population of the two main cities (Oyem and Makokou) of this region. Of these, 61 (7.5%) were found to be positive for HIV-1. Analysis of the env (gp120), pol, and gag (p24) sequences as well as phylogenetic analyses showed at least eight different viral lineages. The most prevalent strains were CRF02 recombinants, followed by subtypes A, D, and C. The remaining strains were found to be F, J, G, and also, for the first time in Gabon, the recombinant form CRF11cpx. Analysis of antiretroviral drug-resistance mutations in protease and reverse transcriptase from this untreated population showed a low level of specific mutations. These mutations were associated with subtype polymorphism rather than with resistance to antiretroviral drugs. The wide diversity and the emergence of recombinant strains are in accordance with the rapid spread of new HIV strains in the population and, thus, the dynamic evolution of the epidemic."

The recently reported data on AIDS progression in patients, and on gene mutation and polymorphism of CCR5, CCR2b and SDF-1 genes were collected. The data also included the HIV-1-associated genes polymorphisms of the Chinese individuals detected by the present authors. There was a significant link between the gene mutation, polymorphism of HIV-1-associated genes, genetic susceptibilities and the AIDS progression in patients, although the differences of HIV-1-associated gene mutation, polymorphisms existed among different ethnic populations in the world. The Chinese individuals are more likely to be infected by the M-tropic HIV-1 strain than the American Caucasian. The Chinese individuals have very low gene mutation of CCR5Delta32, which would be helpful for the prevention and gene therapy against the HIV-1 infection."
473,0.005,1.0000,"A case control study was carried out to determine the exposure factors of gluteal fibrotic contracture (GFC). Sixty two school children were taken as the case group and were matched for sex, age and village of residence with 62 of their classmates constituting the control group. It was found that all 62 members of the case group had received intramuscular (IM) injections at some time prior to the onset of GFC, while only 57 of the control group had received IM injections. This difference is a statistically significant (p = 0.029). Injection sites on both buttocks were higher in the case group than among the controls. The odds ratio for the prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) in the case group as compared to the control group was 3.0 (95% CI 1.1-7.8). A trend correlation was found between the annual frequency of IM injection, GFC and HBV infection. We concluded that IM injections played an important role in GFC and added to the risk of HBV infection, because they had been administered by improperly sterilized reusable syringes in an area where both GFC and HBV infections were prevalent and IM injection was common."
19384,0.005,1.0000,"Cyclophilin A (CypA), predominantly located intracellularly, is a multifunctional protein. We previously reported decreased CypA levels in hepatocytes of transgenic mice expressing hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg). In this study, we found that expression of HBV small surface protein (SHBs) in human hepatoma cell lines specifically triggered CypA secretion, whereas SHBs added extracellularly to culture medium did not. Moreover, CypA secretion was not promoted by the expression of a secretion deficient SHBs mutant, suggesting a close association between secretion of CypA and SHBs. Interaction between CypA and SHBs was observed by using coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. Hydrodynamic injection of the SHBs expression construct into C57BL/6J mice resulted in increased serum CypA levels and ALT/AST levels, as well as the infiltration of inflammatory cells surrounding SHBs-positive hepatocytes. The inflammatory response and serum ALT/AST level were reduced when the chemotactic effect of CypA was inhibited by cyclosporine and anti-CD147 antibody. Furthermore, higher serum CypA levels were detected in chronic hepatitis B patients than in healthy individuals. In HBV patients who had received liver transplantation, serum CypA levels declined dramatically after the loss of HBsAg as a consequence of liver transplantation. Taken together, these results indicate that expression and secretion of SHBs can promote CypA secretion, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of HBV infection."
14790,0.005,1.0000,"Injection drug use is the major mode of hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission in developed countries. Despite this, relatively few current and recovering injection drug users (IDUs) have received HCV treatment. Studies among individuals with a recent history of injection drug use or those receiving drug dependency treatment have provided evidence that these groups can be successfully treated for chronic HCV infection. These studies have provided the impetus to change guidelines for treatment of current and recovering IDUs, with a move toward individualized HCV treatment assessment and the removal of defined periods of illicit drug use abstinence. Strategies to improve access to HCV treatment for current and recovering IDUs include drug dependency treatment education and training for hepatologists and other HCV treatment physicians, HCV treatment education and training for addiction medicine physicians, development of multidisciplinary clinics, and peer-based eduction and support for individuals considering and receiving HCV treatment."
754,0.005,1.0000,"Injection drug users who continue to use drugs may not respond to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as well as other HIV-infected individuals, even after adjusting for a reliable measure of adherence. We therefore compared the virologic response among participants in a population-based HIV/AIDS Drug Treatment Program in British Columbia, Canada, by injection drug use activity. Participants who were HIV infected and naive to antiretroviral therapy and who were prescribed antiretroviral treatment between August 1996 and December 2000 were eligible for this study. They were classified as current, former, or non-injection drug users. The main outcome was having two consecutive HIV-1 RNA levels less than 500 copies/mL. We used logistic regression to adjust for baseline HIV-1 RNA, type of antiretroviral regimen (2 nucleosides + nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor versus 2 nucleosides + protease inhibitor), duration of therapy (months), adherence (derived from refill compliance data), and age. A total of 578 participants were first prescribed HAART during the study period. Among them, 78 (13%) were current injection drug users, 96 (17%) were former injection drug users, and 404 (70%) never injected drugs. In the multivariable logistic regression, relative to non-drug users, current injection drug users were significantly less likely to suppress their HIV-1 RNA (adjusted OR [AOR] = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.13-0.67), and former injection drug users were not significantly different from non-drug users (AOR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.24-1.34). There was a significant interaction between drug use and adherence. In the analyses stratified by drug use, the adherence of former and non-drug users was positively associated with HIV-1 RNA suppression (AOR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.14-1.55), whereas for current drug users, it was not (AOR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.87-1.33). Current injection drug users were less likely to achieve HIV-1 RNA suppression compared with non-drug users.

Clinical isolates with a wide range of 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of zidovudine (IC50, 0.003 to > 2.0 microM) and didanosine (IC50, 0.02 to > 10.0 microM) were inhibited by atevirdine (median IC50, 0.74 microM; range, 0.06-1.60). Cross-resistance to atevirdine in zidovudine- or didanosine-resistant isolates was not observed. Combinations of atevirdine and zidovudine were highly synergistic against zidovudine-resistant clinical isolates of HIV-1. By contrast, these combinations were mostly additive when tested against zidovudine-susceptible isolates. Combinations of atevirdine and didanosine were additive in their effects against both didanosine-susceptible and -resistant isolates. These data suggest that the interaction of atevirdine with HIV-1 RT is different than that of other nonnucleoside RT inhibitors and that combinations of atevirdine and zidovudine may be useful in patients with AIDS who have initially received monotherapy with zidovudine."
10151,0.005,1.0000,"The occurrence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease and hepatitis C is common in injection drug users, most of whom are opioid dependent. Methadone pharmacotherapy has been the most widely used treatment for opioid addiction in this population. Methadone has significant, adverse drug-drug interactions with many antiretroviral therapeutic agents that can contribute to nonadherence and poor clinical outcomes in this high-risk population. The present article summarizes current knowledge about interactions between methadone and antiretroviral medications. Buprenorphine is the newest agent available for the treatment of opioid dependence and may have fewer adverse interactions with antiretroviral agents. Buprenorphine has a significant pharmacokinetic interaction with efavirenz but no pharmacodynamic interaction; therefore, simultaneous administration of these drugs is not associated with opioid withdrawal, as has been observed with methadone. This promising finding may simplify the treatment of opioid-dependent patients with HIV disease and should also improve clinical outcomes for persons coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus."

During follow-up, 1630 patients with PTLD were diagnosed. HCV prevalence at transplantation was 11.3%. HCV infection did not increase PTLD risk in the total cohort (Cox regression model, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.05), even after adjustment for type of organ transplanted, indication for transplantation, degree of HLA mismatch, donor type, or use of immunosuppression medications. Additional analyses also revealed no association by PTLD subtype (defined by site, pathology, cell type, and tumor Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] status). HCV infection did increase PTLD risk among the 2.8% of patients (N = 5959) who were not reported to have received immunosuppression maintenance medications prior to hospital discharge (HR = 3.09; 95% CI, 1.14-8.42; P interaction = .007). Our findings suggest that HCV is not a major risk factor for PTLD, which is consistent with the model in which an intact immune system is necessary for development of HCV-related lymphoproliferation."

Two control chimpanzees received identical doses of HBV not incubated with the murine anti-HBs. Neither study chimpanzee developed HBV infection during 12 months of follow-up as judged by normal serum aminotransferase activity, normal liver biopsies, and negative serological tests for HBV-associated antigens and antibodies. In contrast, both control chimpanzees became infected by HBV as evidenced by elevated serum aminotransferase activity, liver biopsy changes characteristic of viral hepatitis, and the appearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in their sera. Both study chimpanzees were shown to be fully susceptible to infection with these same HBV inocula when challenged 15 months after the initial inoculations at a time when passively administered anti-HBs was no longer detectable. Prior to challenge with HBV, one of the two study chimpanzees received a second injection of the same volume of the murine monoclonal anti-HBs.

We therefore performed a meta-analysis to estimate this association. A search of the literature published prior to November 1, 2013, was conducted using various databases. Eleven eligible studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results revealed that rs12979860 genotype CC in the recipient, donor, and recipient/donor pair was significantly related to high SVR in the recipients (recipient: odds ratio [OR]=3.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.18-4.30; donor: OR=2.65, 95% CI=1.83-3.85; recipient/donor pair: OR=6.05, 95% CI=3.16-11.58).

Analyses were carried out among patients who received ATV/r in the CASTLE study to better understand the clinical significance of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia associated with administration of boosted ATV. Hyperbilirubinemia was defined as total bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated) elevation greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (grade 3-4). Patients in the ATV/r arm were assessed based on the presence or absence of hyperbilirubinemia through week 96. Analyses included number of confirmed virologic responders (CVR; HIV RNA<50 copies per milliliter), impact of hyperbilirubinemia on symptoms, elevations in liver enzymes, patient quality of life, and medication adherence. Through 96 weeks in the CASTLE study, 44% of patients who received ATV/r had hyperbilirubinemia at any time point, and between 12.5% and 21.6% had hyperbilirubinemia at any single study visit. At 96 weeks, 74% of patients overall and 84% and 69% of patients with and without hyperbilirubinemia, respectively, achieved CVR. Symptoms of jaundice or scleral icterus occurred in 5% of patients overall and in 11% with hyperbilirubinemia and 0% without hyperbilirubinemia. Four percent of patients with and 3% of patients without hyperbilirubinemia had grade 3-4 elevations in liver transaminases. Less than 1% of patients discontinued treatment due to hyperbilirubinemia. There were no differences in quality of life or adherence between patients with or without hyperbilirubinemia. In the CASTLE study, hyperbilirubinemia observed in the ATV/r group did not negatively impact clinical outcomes in HIV-infected patients."

The mean age of the cohort was 29.9 + 4.9 years; all were men. A majority of patients (73%) achieved viral suppression (HIV-RNA <1000 copies/mL). Correlates of viral suppression include self-reported > or = 95% adherence (P < 0.01) and current use of trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (P < 0.01); current or ever diagnosed with tuberculosis was associated with viral non-suppression (P = 0.006). Tobacco use was prevalent (84%), and surprisingly 48% of patients reported active drug use; neither was associated with viral non-suppression. This is the first study to document successful ART treatment in a population of Vietnamese drug users; rates of viral suppression are comparable to other international populations. The 28% of patients without HIV-1 suppression highlight the need for adherence promotion, risk reduction programmes, and population-based surveillance strategies for assessing the emergence of HIV drug resistance in settings where access to viral load and drug resistance testing is limited."

Data were analysed from GT1-infected patients enrolled in six phase 3 studies of 3D ± RBV. Patients who experienced non-virologic failure were excluded from analysis. HCV RNA was determined using the Roche COBAS TaqMan RT-PCR assay (lower limit of quantification, LLOQ =25 IU/mL). SVR12 was analysed by week of first HCV RNA suppression, defined as HCV RNA <LLOQ. The analysis included a total of 2027 patients. Cumulative proportions of subjects with initial HCV RNA suppression <LLOQ at weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6 were 31%, 81%, 99% and 100%, respectively. SVR12 was achieved by 98%, 97%, 98% and 92% of patients with initial suppression at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6, respectively (P=.42, trend test). Across six phase 3 trials of 3D ± RBV, most patients achieved viral suppression by week 2. Time to viral suppression was not associated with subsequent achievement of SVR12, suggesting that on-treatment virologic monitoring may not be necessary with this regimen."
9625,0.005,1.0000,"This nonexperimental, descriptive study examined relationships between recent intimate partner violence (IPV) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among women. Data from 272 HIV-infected women receiving care at a large HIV clinic were obtained through interviews and medical record abstraction. The Severity of Violence Against Women Scale was used to determine IPV experience in the previous 12 months; the prevalence of recent IPV in our sample was 52%. Mean Domestic Violence Specific Morisky Medication Adherence Scale scores among women experiencing recent IPV were significantly lower (M = 5.49, SD = 2.06) than in women without IPV experiences (M = 6.57, SD = 1.57, t[262.1] = 4.91, p < .001). A greater proportion of detectable viral loads (Fisher's exact p < .001) was found in women experiencing recent IPV compared to women who did not experience IPV. The data indicate that clinicians should screen HIV-infected women frequently for IPV when assessing ART adherence. "
9937,0.005,1.0000,"There is no consensus on a gold standard for monitoring adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We compared different adherence monitoring tools in predicting virologic failure as part of a clinical trial. HIV-infected Thai and Cambodian children aged 1-12 years (N=207) were randomized to immediate-ART or deferred-ART until CD4% <15%. Virologic failure (VF) was defined as HIV-RNA >1000 copies/mL after ≥6 months of ART. Adherence monitoring tools were: (1) announced pill count, (2) PACTG adherence questionnaire (form completed by caregivers), and (3) child self-report (self-reporting from children or caregivers to direct questioning by investigators during the clinic visit) of any missed doses in the last 3 days and in the period since the last visit. The Kappa statistic was used to describe agreement between each tool. The median age at ART initiation was 7 years with median CD4% 17% and HIV-RNA 5.0 log(10)copies/mL and 92% received zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine. Over 144 weeks, 13% had VF. Mean adherence by announced pill count before VF in VF children was 92% compared to 98% in children without VF (p=0.03). Kappa statistics indicated slight to fair agreement between tools. In multivariate analysis adjusting for gender, treatment arm ethnicity and caregiver education, significant predictors of VF were poor adherence by announced pill count (OR 4.56; 95%CI 1.78-11.69), reporting any barrier to adherence in the PACTG adherence questionnaire (OR 7.08; 95%CI 2.42-20.73), and reporting a missed dose in the 24 weeks since the last HIV-RNA assessment (OR 8.64; 95%CI 1.96-38.04). In conclusion, we recommend the child self-report of any missed doses since last visit for use in HIV research and in routine care settings, because it is easy and quick to administer and a strong association with development of VF."
6833,0.005,1.0000,"To more accurately determine the seroprevalence of hepatitis G virus (HGV) infection, we surveyed antibody to HGV (anti-E2) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and HGV RNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 298 residents of a hepatitis C virus (HCV)-endemic area of Japan and in 225 hemodialysis patients. We then compared these findings with known HCV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection prevalences. Anti-E2 and HGV RNA prevalences were 32 (10.7%) and 5 (1.7%) in the residents and 24 (10.7%) and 10 (4.4%) in the hemodialysis patients, respectively. Anti-E2 and HGV RNA concurrence was found in two of the hemodialysis patients. Total HGV marker (anti-E2 and/or HGV RNA) prevalences [37 (12.4%) in residents and 32 (14.2%) in hemodialysis patients], were significantly lower than the prevalences of antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) by ELISA [59 (19.8%) and 96 (42.7%)], and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) by radioimmunoassay (RIA) [87 (29.2%) and 101 (44.9%)] (P<0.05). The anti-HCV prevalence in subjects with total HGV marker was significantly higher than in those without total HGV marker. There was no significant difference in anti-HBc prevalence between those with and without total HGV marker. The viremic rate was highest in HCV infection (HCV RNA by PCR/anti-HCV) (83.2%), with HGV infection (HGV RNA/total HGV marker) (21.7%) intermediate, and HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen by RIA/anti-HBc) (5.3%) lowest (P<0.05). These findings indicate that HGV infection was less endemic than HCV and HBV. HGV was eliminated naturally more frequently than HCV infection and less frequently than HBV infection."
13576,0.005,1.0000,"Symptom management in HIV/AIDS is a critical issue that influences the quality of life of those living with the disease. Although the goals of treating the numbers living with HIV/AIDS have not yet been achieved, availability of antiretroviral therapies (ARVs) has been expanded to many clinical settings in KwaZulu-Natal, the epicenter of HIV infection in South Africa. The South African Department of Health (2007) estimates indicate that 5.54 million South Africans are living with HIV/AIDS, whereas UNAIDS (2007) estimates suggest that 18.8% of the population in South Africa is affected. Because the symptom experience may influence adherence to ARVs and quality of life, this study focused on the prevalence of symptoms reported by patients (N = 149) diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and adherence to medications and appointments. Self-report data were obtained from this community-based sample of HIV-infected patients who received care in outpatient clinics in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. With an average of three side effects, the most frequently reported by the study participants were fatigue/tiredness (41%), rashes (40%), headaches (32%), insomnia (31%), sadness (24%), disturbing dreams (23%), numbness (22%), pain (22%), and self-appearance (20%). On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being worst possible), those with symptoms reported an average intensity of 4.2 (SD = 2.0), and the degree to which symptoms affected activity levels was 3.2 (SD = 2.2). Although intensity of symptoms and effects on activity levels were strongly correlated (r = .78, p < .001), there were no significant relationships between adherence and the intensity of symptoms or the relationship of symptoms with activity levels. Logistic regression analyses indicate that the presence of a greater number of symptoms was not associated with greater adherence (odds ratio = 2.27, 95% confidence interval = 0.60-8.70, ns). However, those who reported higher adherence were 1.5 times more likely to report greater physical health than low adherers (p = .04). High adherers were also 1.6 times more likely to report greater psychological health than low adherers (p = .03). This suggests that further study is needed to investigate adherence motivations for those living with HIV/AIDS in South Africa because adherence seems not to be linked to the frequency of symptoms or limitations on activity related to symptoms."

We present a clinical case with a probable cause and effect association between these two entities. A 71-year-old woman developed an erythematous exanthem with pruritic and scaly lesions located at the torso and upper limbs associated with heliotrope and Gottron's papules. At the same time, she notice a significant loss of muscular strength. Skin and muscular biopsies made the diagnosis of dermatomyositis and the patient started with prednisolone (60 mg/day) with poor symptoms control. Paraneoplastic syndrome, HIV, hepatitis B virus and syphilis infections were excluded. HCV serology was positive, with a viral load of 58 159 IU/mL (genotype 1a). Therefore, the patient underwent a 12-week treatment with grazoprevir 100 mg and elbasvir 50 mg achieving a sustained virological response with regression of skin lesions and complete recovery of muscular strength (photodocumented before/after treatment). Additionally it was possible to reduce prednisolone dosage to 5 mg/day."
7644,0.005,1.0000,"A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing two daily doses of oral ribavirin (600 mg and 800 mg) and placebo was conducted at six medical centers. Two hundred fifteen adults were enrolled over a 5-month period and randomized to receive ribavirin 800 mg daily (74 subjects), ribavirin 600 mg (71 subjects), or placebo (70 subjects). Active treatment was administered for 24 weeks followed by a 4-week wash-out period. Fifteen patients receiving placebo, 10 receiving ribavirin 600 mg, and 18 receiving ribavirin 800 mg developed AIDS during the 28-week study period. Ribavirin at daily doses of 600 mg or 800 mg for 24 weeks did not significantly affect the rate of progression to AIDS as defined by the Centers for Disease Control, in univariate analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, or Cox proportional hazards modeling. Although in the proportional hazards analysis, the dose-response regression coefficients indicated a reduction of 43% in the hazard of progression to AIDS among patients on active treatment, it was not statistically significant (p = 0.19). Furthermore, there was no evidence that ribavirin had a significant effect upon any immunologic or virologic parameter measured, including CD4 count, CD4:CD8 ratio, lymphocyte proliferative response, skin test reactivity, interferon-gamma production, peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or level of HIV p24 antigen in serum. The most prominent adverse effect of ribavirin was induction of a mild reversible hemolytic anemia (mean fall in hematocrit, 5%). No severe or unremitting drug reaction was documented."
13052,0.005,1.0000,"A 30-year-old man diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 10 years earlier, presented with large tense blisters associated with minimal itching of 10 days' duration. He had no history of oral or genital erosions or ulcerations and showed no symptoms of HIV-related illnesses. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) had been started 6 weeks earlier when his CD4 count was 116/mL. He initially received nevirapine 200 mg once daily; after 2 weeks with no skin eruptions or other adverse reactions, the dose was increased to 200 mg twice daily. Other components of his HAART included lamivudine and stavudine. The patient was not taking any other prescription or alternative medicines. During the past year, he experienced 4 episodes of intensely itchy urticarial lesions that subsided with antihistamines. The present episode of bullous lesions was also preceded by urticarial lesions. On examination, he had multiple, large, tense bullae over relatively normal-looking skin involving all parts of the body (Figure 1). There were a few well-defined erosions. Nikolsky and bullae spread signs were negative, and no oral or genital erosions or ulcerations were noted. Results of a complete blood count, renal and liver function tests, and chest x-ray were within normal limits. Skin biopsy from one of the blisters showed a subepidermal bulla filled with eosinophils and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Figure 2). The underlying dermis showed perivascular inflammatory infiltrate composed of polymorphonuclear and lymphomononuclear cells. The overall features were suggestive of bullous pemphigoid. A direct immunofluorescence test could not be done because of possible risk of cross-infection to the operator of the cryostat. Workup for herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus infection also could not be performed. HAART was discontinued temporarily with the suspicion that it was the causative factor. The patient was started on oral prednisolone 40 mg/d and topical clobetasol propionate (0.05%). Within 1 week of treatment, he had significant improvement with almost complete disappearance of the lesions. A few small, tense vesicles continued to appear between. Once the lesions completely disappeared, the prednisolone was gradually tapered off and all the components of HAART were resumed. The patient did well without any recurrence of lesions, thus virtually excluding HAART as the cause of the bullous pemphigoid-like eruptions. Subsequently, he did not return for follow-up."
2562,0.005,1.0000,"Gene expression from HIV-based gene therapy vectors or live-attenuated HIV-1 vaccines requires RNA transcription supported by the HIV-1 promoter, the long terminal repeat (LTR). Delivery of live-attenuated HIV-1 vaccines as plasmid DNA would overcome problems associated with production of attenuated HIV-1 strains. We investigated the expression of reporter plasmids and proviral HIV-1 constructs driven by either the HIV-1 LTR or LTRs with deletions in the U3 enhancer regions. LTR-driven plasmids were inoculated by gene gun into both human epidermis ex vivo and macaques in vivo. The HIV-1 LTR drove reporter gene expression in human and macaque skin, although with 15- to 20-fold less efficiency compared to the immediate-early cytomegalovirus promoter. A deleted LTR derived from a naturally attenuated HIV-1 strain infecting a member of the well-characterized Sydney Blood Bank Cohort of long-term nonprogressors was 5-fold less efficient in expression of the reporter gene compared to wild-type LTR. Delivery of proviral wild-type HIV-1 DNA constructs to human skin resulted in recovery of HIV-1 from cells emigrating from the epidermis, providing an ex vivo model of the infectivity of proviral HIV-1 DNA. However, delivery of proviral HIV-1 DNA containing deletions in either the LTR, Nef, or the secondary viral transcription activator,Vpr, significantly reduced HIV-1 replication in this model. The early coexpression of Tat from a second plasmid did not restore replication. Thus, although attenuated lentiviral vaccines might be deliverable as proviral DNA constructs in primate subjects, significant improvements are needed to enhance the efficiency of this method."

In this phase I study, FP-21399 was administered intravenously over 1 h as a single dose (0.9, 1.7, 2.8, and 4.2 mg/kg) or as a once-weekly infusion (1, 2, and 3 mg/kg) for 4 consecutive weeks to 34 HIV-1 infected patients with CD4(+) cell counts of 50-400 cells/microL. Concomitant antiretroviral therapy was permitted but not required. The most frequent adverse events involved the transient, dose-dependent appearance of drug- or metabolite-related color in the urine and skin. Plasma drug levels were linear with dose. The drug was cleared, with an elimination half-life of 4 h and a terminal half-life of 1.5-2 days; the terminal half-life represented redistribution and clearance from tissues. FP-21399 administered weekly for 4 weeks was well tolerated. Further studies are necessary to define the role of this fusion inhibitor in the treatment of HIV infection."
5217,0.005,1.0000,"In HIV-infected patients, an increase in the production of oxygen-reactive species (ROS) is observed, with a consequent reduction of plasma levels of antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol. The nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is activated by a prooxidant state in the infected T cells through the release of its inhibitory subunit I-kappaB. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the behavior of hematological parameters and markers of anemia in HIV-infected patients who underwent antiretroviral therapy associated with 800 mg/day alpha-tocopherol supplementation. Blood samples were collected from supplemented (n=9) and not-supplemented (n=9) HIV-seropositive patients (n=18). We observed a decreased viral load in the alpha-tocopherol-supplemented group (p<0.05); other changes, such as an increase in the CD4/CD8 ratio, in the hematocrit and in the hemoglobin concentration were also observed, though lacking statistical significance. We conclude that antiretroviral therapy in association with alpha-tocopherol (800 mg/day) supplementation is more effective in reducing viral load levels and also, possibly, in recovering other hematological parameters after a 60-day period of use."
7421,0.005,1.0000,"The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic represents a modern-day plague that has not only resulted in a tragic loss of people from a wide spectrum of society but has reshaped our viewpoints regarding health care, the treatment of infectious diseases, and social issues regarding sexual behavior. There is little doubt now that the cause of the disease AIDS is a virus known as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The HIV virus is a member of a large family of viruses termed retroviruses, which have as a hallmark the capacity to convert their RNA genome into a DNA form that then undergoes a process of integration into the host cell chromosome, followed by the expression of the viral genome and translation of viral proteins in the infected cell. This review describes the organization of the HIV-1 viral genome, the expression of viral proteins, as well as the functions of the accessory viral proteins in HIV replication. The replication of the viral genome is divided into two phases, the early phase and the late phase. The early phase consists of the interaction of the virus with the cell surface receptor (CD4 molecule in most cases), the uncoating and conversion of the viral RNA genome into a DNA form, and the integration into the host cell chromosome. The late phase consists of the expression of the viral proteins from the integrated viral genome, the translation of viral proteins, and the assembly and release of the virus. Points in the HIV-1 life cycle that are targets for therapeutic intervention are also discussed."

Five patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated KS (4 receiving antiretroviral therapy) and 2 patients with classical KS were administered CDV (5 mg/kg/dose) weekly for 2 weeks and then every other week. All 7 patients had progression of their KS at a median of 8.1 weeks (range, 5-27 weeks). Skin biopsy specimens of KS lesions showed no change in expression of latent or early lytic genes, but, in the 1 assessable patient, there was decreased expression of a late lytic gene. There was no decrease in the virus load of KSHV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This study does not provide proof of principle for the treatment of KS with CDV. However, it remains possible that antiherpesvirus therapy can be developed for herpes-induced tumors."
8787,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to determine if a correlation exists between long-term azidothymidine (AZT) therapy and low pseudocholinesterase concentrations in patients who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A pilot study was conducted of 10 patients infected with HIV, 5 of whom were receiving AZT. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests, helper/inducer T lymphocyte numbers (CD4), serum dibucaine numbers, and serum pseudocholinesterase concentrations were examined. Control and study subjects both exhibited normal dibucaine numbers, but the pseudocholinesterase concentrations were significantly lower in the group that was not receiving AZT relative to the AZT treatment group. However, only two patients, neither of whom were receiving AZT, demonstrated low or borderline low pseudocholinesterase concentrations according to laboratory criteria. It is possible that pseudocholinesterase synthesis is significantly inhibited by the HIV disease process and that treatment with AZT partly reverses the inhibition. Associated variables contributing to low pseudocholinesterase concentrations in the HIV-positive patient are explored."

The dUST was studied in 29 HIV-1 positive patients, 18 without low serum vitamin B12 or low red cell folate and 11 with low serum vitamin B12 (6 patients), low red cell folate (4 patients) and 1 case with both. The role of AZT was studied using different concentrations (0.2, 2.5 and 10 microM/ml) in 2 groups: 1 group of 5 patients with vitamin B12 and/or folate deficiency and another group consisting of 13 healthy subjects. Methotrexate (MTX)(50 micrograms/ml) was added to induce a folate megaloblastic pattern in the latter group. Results of the dUST in the HIV-1 group without low levels of serum vitamin B12 fell within the health-related reference interval values. A vitamin B12 deficiency was only detected in 1 case in the HIV-1 group with low serum vitamin B12, although a folate deficiency pattern was observed in the 4 patients with low red cell folate. In the healthy subjects AZT induced a dose-dependent decrease of the MTX-induced folate megaloblastic pattern. The pattern was also observed in the group of patients with vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, although AZT did not entirely interfere with the dUST. The effect of AZT on the dUST was attributed to a decrease in the incorporation of the isotope in the absence of deoxyuridine. The dUST is useful in differentiating vitamin B12 deficient patients from HIV-1 infected patients with low levels of serum vitamin B12."

These cells and cells of the endothelium express scavenger receptors which mediate the transport of modified low density lipoprotein (LDL). LDL modified by covalently bound azidothymidine (AZT), a potent inhibitor of HIV replication, is internalized via this pathway into human macrophages. Treatment of HIV-1 infected human macrophages with AZT-LDL showed in vitro efficient inhibition of viral replication. In contrast, HIV replication in T-lymphocytes (Molt 4/8), which do not express scavenger receptors, is not inhibited by AZT-LDL but by free AZT."

We evaluated 38 patients infected with HCV genotype 1-17 coinfected with HIV-who were undergoing a full course of pegIFNα/RBV therapy. The interdependence and roles of T cell-mediated immune responses and IL28B rs12979860 single-nucleotide polymorphism genotype as predictors of virological response to anti-HCV treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C were evaluated using nonparametric tests. Factors associated with rapid virological response (RVR) in univariate analysis were presence of CD4 T cell response against NS3 HCV protein, low baseline HCV-RNA, and IL28B CC genotype. Factors associated with sustained virological response (SVR) in univariate analysis were IL28B CC genotype, low baseline HCV-RNA, and presence of CD4 response against NS2. In the multivariate analysis, low baseline HCV-RNA and NS3-specific CD4 response showed a clear trend toward association with RVR (P = 0.09 and P = 0.07, respectively). Regarding SVR, IL28B CC genotype was the strongest predictor (P = 0.02), with presence of NS2-specific CD4 response showing a clear trend (P = 0.09). HCV-specific T cell response influences the outcome of pegIFNα/RBV therapy regardless of IL28B genotype. HCV-specific T cell responses (adaptive immunity) seem to influence viral clearance both in the short and long term during therapy (RVR and SVR), whereas the influence of the IL28B genotype (innate immunity) may be more relevant to the long-lasting therapeutic effect (SVR)."
17137,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes systemic T cell destruction and reduced cell-mediated immunity that leads to a wide range of opportunistic infections and cancers. Second, it directly damages many tissues - gut, brain, lung - through mononuclear cell infection and activation. Third, through immune activation and effects on endothelia, it can cause more subtle systemic organ damage, such as chronic cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary and central nervous system disease. Antiretroviral treatment has enabled HIV-infected persons to live with chronic infection, although with some side-effects and mortality, including reactions due to the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). As cohorts of infected people get older, age-related diseases will combine with chronic HIV infection to produce disabilities whose scale is not yet understood. HIV is detectable in tissues by immunohistochemistry when infection loads are high, such as at first presentation. Pathologists should proactively consider HIV disease in routine diagnostic work, so as to identify more HIV-infected patients and enable their optimal management."

Our children with HIV and AIDS are 3 months to 12 years of age (average 4.5 years); mean age at diagnosis was 18 months. All are either symptomatic or have laboratory evidence of progressive immunodeficiency, 1 is asymptomatic (N2), 1 has mild symptoms (A2) and the rest present significant symptoms or AIDS-defining disease. All have moderate to severe immunodeficiency, as evidenced by CD4+ cells counts. 60% have rapidly progressive disease, based on their symptomatology and immune state, whereas clinical reports in the literature point to only 10-15%. However, the average CD4 + cell count was 22% (749/mm3) at diagnosis and 22% (759/mm3) at last follow-up. These stable findings during an average follow-up of 28 months probably reflect the effect of medical and supportive treatment. All received antiretroviral medication consisting of a combination of 2 or 3 drugs. 8 of 11 also received prophylactic treatment against opportunistic infections and 8 of 11 are clinically well.

100,0.005,1.0000,"Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common; worldwide, an estimated 10% of HIV-infected persons have chronic hepatitis B. Because the incidence of traditional acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related opportunistic infections has decreased with successful anti-HIV therapy, liver disease has emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. HIV infection negatively impacts all phases of the natural history of hepatitis B leading to increased rates of persistent infection, higher HBV DNA levels, lower rates of hepatitis B e antigen loss, increased cirrhosis and liver-related mortality, and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma at lower CD4+ T cell counts. The management of hepatitis B in HIV infection is complicated by the dual activity of several nucleoside analogs, the more rapid development of lamivudine-resistant HBV in patients who are HIV-positive, and the paucity of studies in this population. Until further research emerges on the optimal treatment for this population, data from HBV monoinfected persons will need to be extrapolated to the HIV-HBV coinfected population.

Several standardized screening measures associated with ART nonadherence were examined in order to determine the independent correlates of optimal (≥90%) and perfect (100%) adherence, which were assessed using logistic regression. Of the 302 participants recruited, 263 (87.1%) were prescribed ART. Among those prescribed ART, 229 (87.1%) reported optimal and 146 (55.5%) reported perfect adherence. The prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUD; 43.2%), alcohol dependence (5.3%), recent drug use (6.0%), and depression (44.5%) was high, and most participants had some evidence of neurocognitive impairment. Meeting criteria for having an AUD and depression were collinear (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, having an AUD was inversely related and the only independent correlate of optimal (AOR = 0.427; 95% CI = 0.187-0.976) and perfect (AOR = 0.552; 95% CI = 0.327-0.930) ART adherence. AUDs are highly prevalent among Peruvian HIV-infected MSM and contribute significantly to ART nonadherence. These findings support the need for screening and treating underlying AUDs. In order to meet HIV TasP goals, evidence-based strategies targeting AUDs are likely to directly improve ART adherence and indirectly improve overall individual health, HIV treatment engagement, and reduce transmission to sexual partners among this vulnerable and disproportionally affected population."
8369,0.005,1.0000,"As the focus of the management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection turns from the treatment of AIDS to the entire continuum of the disease, projection of long-term healthcare costs becomes increasingly important. Rather than a fulminant disease treated primarily inside the hospital, HIV infection will become a chronic condition requiring years of outpatient monitoring and pharmacologic intervention with attending increases in pharmacy costs. The objective of this study was to characterize outpatient drug costs by Walter Reed (WR) disease stage in order to estimate the association of disease progression and outpatient prescription drug costs. We hypothesized that there was an association between HIV disease progression, measured by the WR Staging Classification System, and outpatient prescription drug costs. Outpatient drug costs were summarized for 190 HIV-positive patients during a three-month period who presented at Walter Reed Army Medical Center for staging and follow-up. The overall median cost per day per patient for all stages was $3.21 (range $0.01-53.45) with wide variation between patients. Daily costs for patients in WR stage V were the greatest (median $9.26). There was a significant association between WR stage of disease and outpatient drug costs (Spearman rho = 0.51, t = 6.9, df = 188, p less than 0.001). The association was not completely linear because costs in WR stage VI were less than WR stages IV or V. Annual extrapolated outpatient drug costs for these 190 patients would be nearly $0.5 million."

8502,0.005,1.0000,"One of the main aspects related to non-adherence to combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) for patients infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) refers to the abandonment of outpatient care. This study was aimed to estimate the loss to follow-up in outpatient HIV care at a Regional Referral Clinic (SAE) for HIV/AIDS in the city of Juiz de Fora, Brazil, and to identify associated factors and predictors. This is a prospective cohort of patients older than 18 years, under cART and regular outpatient care. The study included patients who attended medical visits during July-August 2011. Those who did not return to the clinic for new medical appointments within 90 days after the sixth month of follow up were considered lost to follow-up in outpatient care. Variables with P value ≤0.25 in the univariate analysis were included in a logistic regression model, adopting a significance level of 0.05. Among the 250 patients included in the study, 44 (17.6 %) were lost to follow up in outpatient care. Among these, 38 (86.4 %) were located in the cART delivery database system (SICLOM). Younger patients (≤43 versus >43 years) (OR 2.30 CI 1.06-5.00, P = 0.04), and patients attended by physician ""E"", when compared with physicians ""A"", ""B"", ""C"" or ""D"" (OR 5.90 CI 2.64-13.18, P = 0.00) were more likely to be lost to follow-up. Patients admitted in the service for 7 years or more were also more likely to be to lost to follow-up (OR 2.27 CI 1.2-4.4, P = 0.01), although this association did not remain statistically significant in the multivariate analysis. Although the purpose of the study, to identify individual factors associated to loss to follow-up, positives associations with a specific physician and with patients admitted in the service for 7 years or more suggest organizational factors. Although the majority of patients lost to follow-up in outpatient care were detected by SICLOM, a detectable viral load in most of these patients suggest a quality of outpatient HIV care proved ineffective, despite the availability of cART. We conclude on the need for further studies to investigate structural factors associated to loss to follow-up when enhanced retention strategies should be implemented in order to maintain an effective outpatient HIV care."
92,0.005,1.0000,"The effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) serostatus, AIDS, and level of immunosuppression on health service use were examined in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Data on self-reported hospitalizations, outpatient medical services (non-emergency room) and emergency room care during the preceding 6 months were collected for 3,447 homosexual/bisexual men returning for their 14th and/or 15th semiannual visits in Chicago, Baltimore, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh. AIDS-free seropositive men with CD4+ cells < 200/microliters were more likely to be hospitalized [odds ratio (OR) = 2.3, 95% confidence limits (CL) = 1.4, 3.8] and use outpatient medical care (OR = 7.9, 95% CL = 4.9, 12.6), compared with seronegative men. Increased outpatient care was initiated at the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection, even when CD4+ cells were > 500/microliter. Dramatic increases in outpatient care for each level of immunosuppression were observed. HIV-1-related symptoms were associated with increased hospitalizations (OR = 4.8, 95% CL = 3.2, 7.3), use of outpatient medical services (OR = 3.3, 95% CL = 1.9, 5.6), and emergency room care (OR = 3.1, 95% CL = 2.1, 4.6). Persons with AIDS and < or = 50 CD4+ cells/microliter most likely to be hospitalized (OR = 8.1; 95% CL = 4.4, 14.9). No significant difference (p > 0.05) in emergency room use was observed according to HIV-1 serostatus, AIDS, or immunosuppression, after adjusting for insurance and clinical symptoms. To the extent that CD4+ cell counts are used as one of the criteria for an AIDS diagnosis and such a diagnosis broadens available benefits to persons with HIV disease, the pattern of health care services described here will be important for health care providers and planners."
17979,0.005,1.0000,"In this study, amino acid sequence variation in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Gag CD8(+) T cell epitopes was examined in untreated mother-infant pairs. Several HIV-1 CD8(+) T cell escape variants were identified within maternal plasma viral p17 and p24 sequences that were either not detected or did not persist in the plasma of their non-HLA-matched HIV-1-infected infants. Viruses constructed with each of these mutations demonstrated reduced viral replication in vitro and reduced expression of p17 and p24 proteins compared with wild type. Reduced recognition of the variant sequences compared with wild-type sequence was also demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunospot assays. Nontransmission or reversion after transmission was thus associated with reduced viral fitness cost in vivo. Better understanding of the balance between CD8(+) T cell selective pressures and viral fitness cost may facilitate the identification of optimal viral sequences for inclusion in HIV-1 vaccines."
521,0.005,1.0000,"There is a high burden of underlying substance use and mental illness in HIV-infected populations. HIV-care settings provide an important opportunity to assess substance and mental health needs among HIV-positive patients and to provide or make referrals for appropriate treatment services. In 2003, with funding from the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), we developed a model of integrated substance-use counselling and referral for treatment within a primary care HIV-care setting at The Miriam Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. The project uses a multidisciplinary approach to provide linkage to treatment services for substance use and mental illness as well as to help participants with social service needs, such as housing and medical coverage, to ensure continuity of care and optimal HIV treatment adherence. Twelve percent of the 965 HIV-infected patients in care at our center have been enrolled in the project. Of these, all have a current substance-use disorder and 79.3% have been diagnosed with a mental illness. In addition, most participants are hepatitis C-positive (HCV) (65.5%). The majority of participants are on antiretroviral therapy (76.7%). Participants have been referred for the following treatment modalities: intensive outpatient services, methadone, buprenorphine, outpatient services and residential as well as individual and group counselling. Our model has been successful in assessing the substance-use and mental health needs of HIV-infected individuals with numerous co-morbidities and referring them for ancillary medical and social services."
3196,0.005,1.0000,"A 31-year-old cachectic intravenous drug user received treatment at in- and outpatient AIDS care facilities for almost one year before the diagnosis of Munchausen syndrome was established. Cases of factitious AIDS have been reported with increasing frequency since the onset of the AIDS epidemic. Patients typically give a complex history of opportunistic infections and present with acute neurological or psychiatric complaints. Few of these patients have a history of Munchausen syndrome. Most are members of groups at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and are thus at risk for actually developing the conditions they feign. As multidisciplinary care of HIV-infected patients becomes increasingly broad-based, technical, and expensive, health care providers should be aware of the phenomenon of factitious AIDS. Judicious confirmation of medical history and HIV serologic test results should not be overlooked in clinical facilities that are oriented toward treatment of HIV-infected patients."
5192,0.005,1.0000,"To detect the earliest structural changes in the brain in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, 118 gay men and 115 parenteral drug users enrolled in a study of the natural history of HIV infection underwent magnetic resonance imaging evaluations. Routine T2-weighted and heavily T2-weighted scans for quantification of brain water were obtained, blinded to HIV serostatus. Atrophy and foci of increased signal did not correlate with any medical, immunologic, neurologic, or neuropsychologic parameters in the group as a whole, or in the gay men or parenteral drug user subgroups. Three subjects had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and one had central nervous system lymphoma. In a subgroup in whom intracranial water percent was calculated, correlations were found with CD4 counts and CD4/CD8 ratios. We conclude that standard magnetic resonance imaging of the brain does not differentiate asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic HIV-positive individuals from HIV-negative individuals, regardless of risk group. However, intracranial water percent may distinguish HIV-positive from HIV-negative individuals because it correlates with raw CD4 counts and CD4/CD8 ratios."
13991,0.005,1.0000,"In January 1989 [corrected], the media reported the identity of a surgeon who was recently diagnosed with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Concern about surgeon-to-patient transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) persisted despite reassurances from health authorities. Therefore, HIV antibody testing was offered to the surgeon's patients. We identified 2160 patients operated on since 1982; none had been reported to Tennessee's AIDS registry. A total of 264 had already died; none were reported to have died of AIDS or other HIV-related diseases. Of the 1896 patients remaining, we contacted 1652; 616 (37%) were tested. Only one (an intravenous drug user) was HIV antibody positive, and his medical history suggested that he may already have had AIDS at the time of his surgery. These results support the concept that the risks to patients operated on by HIV-infected surgeons are most likely quite low and support recommendations for the individualized assessment of HIV-infected health care workers."

For each case, one control was randomly selected, matched for gender, age, nadir CD4 count and date of HIV diagnosis. Of 15 symptomatic AVN cases identified, eight were in women. Univariate analysis demonstrated significant associations between AVN and a history of systemic steroid use (p = 0.004) and cumulative exposure to protease inhibitor (p = 0.03).

With 100 participants randomly selected at various stages of HIV-related immunosuppression, serum HCV RNA concentrations increased with age (P = .007) and were higher in HIV-positive IDUs with 201-500 (P = .026) and 51-200 (P = .004) CD4 cells/mL than in HIV-negative participants. Among 27 HCV-infected IDUs who acquired HIV infection, serum HCV RNA concentrations varied between semiannual visits by a mean of 0.45 logs, increasing by 0.60 logs after HIV seroconversion (P < .0001), by 0.12 logs each subsequent year (P = .006), and by 0.36 logs per log increase in CD4 cells (P = .01). Serum ALT levels were similar between HIV-positive (40.1 IU/mL) and HIV-negative (45.4 IU/mL) patients (P > .10). While HIV infection and possibly HIV progression are associated with increased HCV RNA levels, other factors appear to affect biochemical and virologic markers of HCV infection in some dually infected persons."

However, the molecular virological factors that contribute to the progression of liver disease in the south Indian setting remain largely unclear. We prospectively studied 679 consecutive patients for HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBeAg, and HBV DNA by qualitative PCR. Randomly selected samples were subjected to bidirectional sequencing to reveal core/precore variants. Of the total 679 chronic HBV cases investigated, 23% (154/679) were replicative HBV carriers. Furthermore, amongst the 560 HBV DNA samples analyzed, 26% (146/560) were viremic. Among the 154 HBeAg positive cases, HBV DNA was positive in 118 cases (77%), significantly (p<0.001) higher than the anti-HBe positive (7%) (28/406) cases. Significant increase in liver disease (p<0.01) with ALT enzyme elevation (p<0.001) was observed in both HBe and anti-HBe viremic cases. Interestingly, low frequencies of mutations were seen in the precore region of the HBV strains studied. HBV precore and core promoter variants were less often detected in subjects with ""e"" negative chronic HBV infection and, therefore, may not have a prognostic role in determining liver disease sequelae in this part of tropical India."

Significant HS (more than 10% of hepatocytes) can be accurately assessed using controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) determination. Aim of this study was to assess prevalence and factors associated with significant HS in HIV monoinfected patients.A total of 364 HIV-infected patients (289 monoinfected) were included in this prospective, cross-sectional study. All patients underwent CAP determination. Steatosis was classified as S1 (significant steatosis) with CAP > 238 dB/m, S2 with CAP > 260 dB/m, and S3 with CAP > 292 dB/m. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the factors associated with HS in this cohort.Significant HS was detected in 118 monoinfected patients (149 in the total cohort). In the total cohort as well as in the monoinfected patients alone, HS grade distribution showed a similar pattern (S1:29%, S2:34%, and S3:37%). Interestingly, patients with HS had a longer history of HIV infection and combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Interalia, age, gender, ethnicity, and metabolic factors were strongly associated with HS, while body mass index (BMI), triglyceride, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were independently associated with significant HS.HS is highly prevalent among HIV monoinfected patients. Although metabolic risk factors, such as obesity and poorly controlled diabetes, are independently associated with HS in HIV monoinfected patients, cART and control of HIV seem to play an indirect role in the development of HS, probably through the return-to-health effect."

Here, we investigated recent posttransplant clinical outcomes of KTRs with HBV and compared them with KTRs with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and seronegative KTRs.Of 3855 KTRs from April 1999 to December 2011, we enrolled 3482 KTRs who had viral hepatitis serology data; the patients were followed up for 89.1 ± 54.1 months. The numbers of recipients with HBV and HCV were 160 (4.6%) and 55 (1.6%), respectively. We analyzed the clinical outcomes, including overall mortality and graft failure, among patients who had undergone kidney transplantation.Patients with HBV showed poorer survival (P = 0.019; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.370; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.155-4.865) than KTRs without HBV. However, the graft survival of patients with chronic hepatitis B did not differ from that of patients without HBV. Hepatic complications were the primary causes of mortality of KTRs with HBV. Mortality significantly correlated with a higher grade of inflammation (P = 0.002) and with the use of lamivudine or adefovir antiviral treatment (P = 0.016). HBV-positive KTRs treated with the new-generation antiviral agent entecavir showed improved patient survival compared with KTRs receiving lamivudine (log-rank P = 0.050). HCV did not affect patient survival; however, it increased the incidence of graft failure (P = 0.010; adjusted HR = 2.899; 95% CI: 1.289-6.519). KTRs with HCV had an increased incidence of acute rejection (log-rank P = 0.005, crude HR = 2.144; 95% CI: 1.341-3.426; P = 0.001).KTRs with chronic hepatitis B may exhibit poor survival due to post-transplantation hepatic complications. Pretransplant histological liver evaluations and adequate antiviral management with potent nucleoside/nucleotide analogues are needed to improve the survival of KTRs with chronic hepatitis B even when liver function is within the normal range.

7590,0.005,1.0000,"This review describes current knowledge of changes in natural killer (NK) cell function in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related disorders, vis-à-vis associated abnormalities in NK cytolytic function, NK cell subset distribution, NK cytopathology, and lymphokine regulation. NK cells, which are closely associated with large granular lymphocytes, are spontaneously cytotoxic to tumor and virally infected targets. As such, they may play a role in natural resistance to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-associated disorders and other opportunistic infections. Yet, peripheral blood NK activity is frequently reduced in patients with HIV-1-induced disease. NK cells are heterogeneous both with respect to their expression of serologically defined membrane antigens and functional activity. In AIDS-related syndromes, there appears to be a diminution of the NK pool (CD16+ cells) involved in cytolytic function, while there is an elevation of the NK pool that coexpresses NK (Leu 7+) and T (CD8+) cell markers, which show little or no involvement in cytolytic function. The impairment of in vitro NK function is not associated with a reduced frequency of lytic conjugates of effectors and target cells nor with the recycling capacity of these effector cells but rather is associated with defects in the NK cell lytic machinery following formation of such conjugates. NK cells in AIDS patients show an impairment in effector cell microtubule rearrangement following target cell interaction. The causes of NK cell dysfunction in AIDS-related disorders remain unknown. NK cells do not appear to express the CD4 epitope of the HIV receptor, nor have they been demonstrated to be susceptible to infection by HIV-1. There appears to be a preponderance of immature NK cells and a lymphokine imbalance in patients with HIV-1 associated disease. Interleukin-2 can partially restore diminished in vitro NK function. Elucidation of the involvement of the NK compartment in natural resistance to HIV-1 merits further investigation."

This report describes the first case, to our knowledge, of nasal NK cell lymphoma in an HIV-positive patient. A 50-year-old African man presented with an obstructive nasopharyngeal tumor, leading to the diagnosis of HIV infection. Nasal biopsy specimens showed NK cell lymphoma, confirmed on nasal tissues by morphologic, immunohistochemical, and polymerase chain reaction studies using a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technique that showed no T-cell receptor gamma rearrangement. The EBV was detected by in situ hybridization. The patient received chemotherapy but died from infection. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of nasal NK cell lymphoma associated with EBV in an HIV patient. Involvement of EBV in HIV non-B-cell lymphomas may represent a further manifestation of opportunistic EBV infection arising in these patients."
7066,0.005,1.0000,"Differences in innate immune responses may be associated with different capabilities of controlling HIV infection, not necessarily reflected by CD4(+) T-cell counts alone. We investigated by cytofluorometry the expression of NK cell receptors and ligands in 19 treated HIV-infected patients with CD4(+)<220 ml(-1) at presentation (11 AIDS, 8 non-AIDS) and 10 healthy donors. Expression of NKp46 and NKp30 was significantly higher in non-AIDS vs. AIDS patients. Overall, the level of NKp46 expression directly correlated with the degree of NK cell cytotoxicity. As compared to healthy donors, in both groups, there was a similar increase of CD69 and HLA-DR expression in NK cells that directly correlated with the presence of activation markers (HLA-DR) on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. As compared to AIDS, in non-AIDS patients in vitro activated CD4(+) showed higher expression of MIC-A (NKG2D ligand), with significantly higher Nectin-2/DNAM-1 and MIC-A/NKG2D ratios. Thus, NK cell responses in AIDS and non-AIDS patients with similar CD4(+) counts significantly differ despite similar treatment. This suggests an involvement of innate mechanisms, in preventing AIDS-defining opportunistic infections in HIV infection and further suggests, that CD4(+) absolute counts alone, may be inadequate to explain differences in the clinical outcome."
7472,0.005,1.0000,"NK cells play important roles in immune surveillance against malignancy and virus-infected cells. NK cell functions are affected in patients infected with HIV-1; however, whether there is direct interaction between NK cells and HIV-1 remains controversial. In this study the expression of CD4, an important receptor for HIV-1, was up-regulated on NK cells co-cultured with an NK cell-selective stimulating cell line, HFWT, and rIL-2. Although the level of CD4 was lower on NK cells than on CD4+ T cells, expression of the HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5 was clearly up-regulated on CD4+ NK cells. CD4+ NK cells expressed higher levels of HLA-DR and CD25 than CD4- NK cells, suggesting that they were highly activated. Cell-free HIV-1 could not infect the NK cells, but NK cells were infected when co-cultured with HIV-1-infected T cells. Using this co-culture system, we can better understand how HIV-1 infects NK cells and how NK cell functions are affected in AIDS."

317,0.005,1.0000,"Natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in host defense against viral infections. However chronic HIV-1 infection is associated with an accumulation of dysfunctional NK cells, that poorly control viral replication. The underlying mechanisms for this NK cell mediated dysfunction are not understood. Certain tumors evade NK cell mediated detection by dampening NK cell activity through the downregulation of NKG2D, via the release of soluble NKG2D-ligands, resulting in a potent suppression of NK cell function. Here we show that chronic HIV-1 infection is associated with a specific defect in NKG2D-mediated NK cell activation, due to reduced expression and transcription of NKG2D. Reduced NKG2D expression was associated with elevated levels of the soluble form of the NKG2D-ligand, MICA, in patient sera, likely released by HIV+CD4+ T cells. Thus, like tumors, HIV-1 may indirectly suppress NK cell recognition of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells by enhancing NKG2D-ligand secretion into the serum resulting in a profound impairment of NK cell function."
18348,0.005,1.0000,"The role of natural killer (NK) cell function in HIV disease especially in the setting of long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) and viral suppression is not fully understood. In the current study, we have investigated NK cell activation in healthy controls and aviremic ART-treated HIV+ subjects with different degrees of immune restoration. We performed a cross sectional study in 12 healthy controls and 24 aviremic ART-treated HIV-infected subjects including 13 HIV+ subjects with CD4+ T cells above 500 cells/μL defined as ""immunologic responders"" and 11 HIV+ subjects with CD4+ T cells below 350 cells/μL defined as ""immunologic non-responders"". We analyzed NK cell number, subset, and activation by expression of CD107a and NKG2D and co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR. NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against uninfected CD4+ T cells was tested in vitro. We found that NK cell absolute number, percentage of NK cells, and percentage of NK cell subsets were similar in the three study groups. The increased NK cell activation was found predominantly in CD56dimCD16+ subset of immunologic non-responders but not immunologic responders compared to healthy controls. The activation of NK cells was inversely correlated with the peripheral CD4+ T cell count in HIV+ subjects, even after controlling for chronic T cell activation, sex, and age, potential contributors for CD4+ T cell counts in HIV disease. Interestingly, NK cells from immunologic non-responders mediated cytotoxicity against uninfected CD4+ T cells ex vivo. NK cells may play a role in blunted CD4+ T cell recovery in ART-treated HIV disease."
17166,0.005,1.0000,": Natural killer (NK) cells are important effectors of innate immunity playing a key role in the eradication and clearance of viral infections. Over the recent years, several studies have shown that HIV-1 pathologically changes NK cell homeostasis and hampers their antiviral effector functions. Moreover, high levels of chronic HIV-1 viremia markedly impair those NK cell regulatory features that normally regulate the cross talks between innate and adaptive immune responses. These pathogenic events take place early in the infection and are associated with a pathologic redistribution of NK cell subsets that includes the expansion of anergic CD56/CD16 NK cells with an aberrant repertoire of activating and inhibitory receptors. Nevertheless, the presence of specific haplotypes for NK cell receptors and the engagement of NK cell antibody-dependent cell cytotocity have been reported to control HIV-1 infection. This dichotomy can be extremely useful to both predict the clinical outcome of the infection and to develop alternative antiviral pharmacological approaches. Indeed, the administration of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected patients restores NK cell phenotype and functions to normal levels. Thus, antiretroviral therapy can help to develop NK cell-directed therapeutic strategies that include the use of broadly neutralizing antibodies and toll-like receptor agonists. The present review discusses how our current knowledge of NK cell pathophysiology in HIV-1 infection is being translated both in experimental and clinical trials aimed at controlling the infection and disease."
18661,0.005,1.0000,"It is estimated that up to one-third of persons with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the United States are not engaged in care. We evaluated factors associated with patients' failure to establish outpatient HIV care at our clinic and found that females, racial minorities, and patients lacking private health insurance were more likely to be ""no shows."" At the clinic level, longer waiting time from the call to schedule a new patient visit to the appointment date was associated with failure to establish care. Because increased numbers of patients will be in need of outpatient HIV care as a result of recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines advocating routine HIV testing, it is imperative that strategies to improve access are developed to overcome the ""no show"" phenomenon."
5683,0.005,1.0000,"Therapeutic measures aimed at boosting the immunity of HIV-infected patients are a critical component of strategies for effective therapy of HIV and AIDS. To improve immunocompetence in patients with progressive disease, autologous lymphocytes that were collected and cryopreserved earlier in the course of HIV-infection were reinfused. None of the 12 patients receiving cell infusions experienced any adverse effects. Improvements in immunologic parameters (CD4+ counts, CD8+ counts, or both; HIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity; or viral load) were seen in seven patients. Restoration of the CD4+ count to the level recorded at the time of cell harvest was achieved in two patients with less advanced disease. Plasma HIV RNA was reduced by >0.5 logs in two of the four patients tested. These preliminary results suggest that cellular immunotherapy using cryopreserved autologous lymphocytes has the potential to improve some measures of immunity in patients with HIV/AIDS and warrants further investigation."
16736,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections were evaluated in chimpanzees that had previously cleared HCV and were rechallenged. Animals that had previously cleared HCV infection rapidly cleared homologous and heterologous virus upon rechallenge, indicative of a strong protective immunity. In one animal, sterilizing immunity was observed with regard to viremia, although viral RNA was transiently detected in the liver. Accelerated viral clearance following rechallenge with HCV was observed in animals that had not been exposed to HCV for over 16 years, suggesting that long-lasting protective immunity may be possible. The ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to recognize HCV proteins was evaluated during the course of the rechallenge experiments. A very early and strong in vitro recall response to HCV nonstructural proteins appeared to be associated with viral clearance. In contrast, proliferative responses to HCV proteins were not observed in 4 persistently infected chimpanzees, and a weak proliferative response was observed in 1 of 2 animals during acute resolving infection. The results suggest that a strong T-cell proliferative response is induced upon rechallenge of chimpanzees with HCV and that this response is associated with rapid viral clearance. The antibody response to HCV proteins increased by over 1,000-fold in all animals following rechallenge as well. A more complete understanding of the role of the cellular immune response in the clearance of HCV and the nature of the protective immune response following viral clearance may aid in the generation of therapies and vaccines."
996,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is necessary to achieve long-term effectiveness. The impact of HIV/AIDS-specific pharmacy services on patient adherence and HIV viral suppression is currently not well described. This study aimed to compare the impact of differing levels of HIV-pharmacy care on adherence and time to HIV viral suppression among participants on HAART enrolled in a population-based HIV/AIDS drug treatment programme in British Columbia. We performed a retrospective observational study of 788 treatment-naïve patients who started HAART between August 1997 and July 2000 and were followed until 31 March 2002. The degree of outpatient pharmacy care was defined according to pharmacy dispensing site for the participants' first prescription of HAART: highest at the AIDS-tertiary care hospital outpatient pharmacies, intermediate at HIV/AIDS drug treatment programme funded off-site pharmacies and lowest at family physician's offices. Cox-proportional hazard models examined the independent effect of pharmacy dispensing site on time to two consecutive HIV viral suppressions controlling for other prognostic factors including physicians' experience, age, gender, injection drug use, use of therapy containing NNRTI versus PI, adherence >90%, AIDS diagnosis at baseline, baseline CD4 cell count and HIV viral load. The median time on antiretrovirals was 28 months (IQR=14-38). There were 489 (62.1%) participants who obtained their medications from the AIDS-tertiary care outpatient pharmacies; 98 (12.4%) from off-site pharmacies and 201 (25.5%) from their physicians' offices. The proportion of patients exhibiting >90% adherence to treatment was observed to be higher among patients receiving their HAART at the AIDS-tertiary care pharmacies compared to off-site pharmacies and to physicians' offices (70.4, 59.2 and 55.7%, respectively; p=0.0001). After adjusting for other prognostic factors, subjects who were first dispensed medications from the AIDS-tertiary care pharmacy were 1.42 times (CI: 1.10-1.84) more likely to achieve HIV viral suppression than those getting their medications from off-site pharmacies and physicians' offices. Providing regular outpatient pharmacy care is independently associated with improved HIV viral load response through enhanced adherence to HAART. Standardization of pharmacy practices for dispensing HAART may improve outcomes for patients who receive their HIV medications from other non-tertiary care pharmacy sites."

Interleukin 27 is a heterodimeric cytokine and a member of interleukin-6/interleukin-12 family. Interleukin-27 shows a broad range of pro- and antiinflammatory properties and plays a determining role during immune responses in combating hepatitis B virus.

Controversy still exists over the role of innate immunity in the progression of HBV infection. Adaptive immunity, especially the immune response mediated by CD8+ T cells, plays an important role in HBV clearance. However, in patients with chronic infection, such CD8+ T cells are often exhausted and associated with various regulatory factors including programmed cell death 1 and T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3. This article elaborates on the association of chronicity of HBV infection with host immune system and various regulating factors. "
19440,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic HCV (hepatitis C virus)-associated cirrhosis represents a major indication for liver transplantation. Bile acids contribute to hepatic stellate cell activation as a key event in fibrogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of bile acids and polymorphisms in bile acid level-regulating genes on fibrosis progression. A total of 206 subjects with chronic HCV infection were included for ABCB11 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member II) 1331T>C and NR1H4 (nuclear receptor) -1G>T genotyping, 178 of which were analysed for fibrosis stage. Exclusion criteria were HBV (hepatitis B virus) or HIV coinfection, alcohol >40 g/day and morbid obesity. A total of 358 patients with NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) were genotyped for comparison with a non-viral liver disease. Caucasian individuals (n = 110), undergoing liver resection for focal hepatic metastasis, served as controls. The ABCB11 1331C allele was significantly overrepresented in HCV patients compared with controls {allelic frequency 62.9%; OR (odds ratio), 1.41 [95% CI (confidence interval), 1.012-1.965]}. Median plasma bile acid levels were not significantly increased in the CC compared with TT genotype [7.2 (1-110) μmol/l compared with 3.5 (1-61) μmol/l; values are medians (range). A significant association between the presence of cirrhosis and ABCB11 genotype (CC compared with CT or TT, P=0.047) was observed in the χ2 test and independent of other risk factors of age, gender, body mass index and disease duration in multivariate analysis (P = 0.010). No such association could be observed in fatty liver patients with regard to advanced fibrosis (F ≥ 2). The common ABCB11 1331CC genotype, which is present in 40% of HCV patients and renders the carrier susceptible to increased bile acid levels, is associated with cirrhosis."

7106,0.005,1.0000,"We investigated how amino acid changes within and outside the V3 loop of the envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 influence the infectivity, host range, and syncytium-forming ability of the virus. Our studies show that on the genomic backgrounds of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strains SF2 and SF13, a reciprocal exchange of full-loop sequences does not alter the syncytium-forming ability of the viruses, indicating that a determinant(s) for this biological property maps outside the loop. However, specific amino acid substitutions, both within and outside the V3 loop, resulted in loss of infectivity, host range, and syncytium-forming potential of the virus. Furthermore, it appears that a functional interaction of the V3 loop with regions in the C2 domain of envelope gp120 plays a role in determining these biological properties. Structural studies of mutant glycoproteins show that the mutations introduced affect the proper association of gp120 with the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41. Our results suggest that mutations that alter the structure of the V3 loop can affect the overall conformation of gp120 and that, reciprocally, the structure of the V3 loop is influenced by the conformation of other regions of gp120. Since the changes in the replicative potential, host range, and fusogenic ability of the mutant viruses correlate well with the changes in gp120 conformation, as monitored by the association of gp120 with gp41, our results support a close relationship between envelope gp120 structural conformation and the biological phenotype of the virus."
8498,0.005,1.0000,"The immune system of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is in a state of chronic activation; however, the nature of HIV-related immune activation is unknown. As normal T-cell activation involves early tyrosine phosphorylation induced by the T-cell antigen receptor-associated src-family protein tyrosine kinase p59(fyn(T)) (Fyn), we examined a potential role for this kinase in HIV-related immune dysfunction. We determined the relative specific kinase activity of Fyn in lysates of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 47 normal control individuals tested negative for HIV-1 and -2, human T-cell lymphotropic virus Type I, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and syphilis; 14 asymptomatic HIV-infected patients having near-normal CD4+ T-cell counts (350 to 980 CD4+ cells/microL); 4 patients with symptomatic acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (<30 CD4+ cells/microL); 13 patients having chronic infection with HBV (6 patients) or HCV (7 patients); and 6 patients with systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE). All patients with asymptomatic HIV disease were shown to have a profound increase (mean increase of 19-fold; range threefold to 56-fold increase; p = 1.33 x 10(-9)) in the relative specific kinase activity of Fyn compared to uninfected controls or patients with hepatitis or SLE. In contrast, patients with AIDS had an Fyn-specific kinase activity that was much less affected (mean increase of threefold; range onefold to sevenfold increase; p = 1.30 x 10(-5)). It was further shown that HIV infection affects the Fyn-specific kinase activity in CD8+-enriched cells, suggesting abnormal Fyn activity in both CD8+ as well as CD4+ T lymphocytes. Initial results implicate a role for the CSK protein tyrosine kinase as responsible for the abnormal Fyn kinase activity observed in HIV-infected patients. These data indicate early and chronic activation of Fyn as a unique HIV-related effect that has the potential to be diagnostic for early HIV infection and/or may serve as a prognostic indicator for advancement to full-blown AIDS. More importantly, sustained activation of the protein tyrosine kinase associated with T-cell antigen receptor function may result in, or contribute to, the immunopathogenic effects associated with HIV infection."

They were 87 males and 56 females with a mean age of 52.3 years (range 14.6-82.3). An associated hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was found in 16 of the 143 NHL cases (11.2%; 95% CI 6.5-17.5). They were 11 males and 5 females [mean age 59.9] year with disseminated (13/16) or localized NHL disease (3/16)]. The NHL histological subgroup was low grade (6/16), intermediate grade (2/16) or high grade (8/16). The cell origin was B in 15/16 cases and B cell-T cell rich in 1/16. The discovery of HCV infection was contemporary to lymphoma diagnosis in 6/16 cases but preceded the NHL onset in the other 10 patients. In these 10 patients the median time between HCV infection diagnosis and NHL onset was 3.6 years (range 1-14.5). These data confirm that in Italy the prevalence of HCV infection in patients with NHL (11.2%) is significantly higher than expected in the general population (1.3-3.2%). The finding that, in most cases, HCV infection was definitely antecedent to NHL onset, usually by years, adds evidence to the possible causative role of the HCV in lymphomagenesis."

17590,0.005,1.0000,"To determine the effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on cervical histology, 32 known HIV-seropositive women underwent cervical colposcopic evaluation. All had cervical cytology, colposcopically directed biopsy, and T-cell studies performed. Thirteen of 32 patients (41%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Another 14 of 32 patients (44%) had histologic evidence of cervicitis. Abnormal cytology, noted in only three women, suggested CIN in one and inflammatory atypia in two. All (five of five) patients with a clinical diagnosis of AIDS had CIN, compared with 30% (eight of 27) of non-AIDS HIV-positive patients (P less than .05). Patients diagnosed with CIN had significantly lower CD4 cell counts (221/mm3 versus 408/mm3; P less than .06) and CD4:CD8 ratios (0.33 versus 0.62; P less than .02) than those without CIN. Patients with cervicitis had greater T-cell immunosuppression than did those with normal histology. In addition, patients with AIDS were more likely to have higher-grade lesions than were non-AIDS HIV-seropositive patients. Seven of 12 CIN specimens available for analysis by polymerase chain reaction using consensus sequence primers detected human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, including three patients with three or more HPV types. Our data suggest that abnormal cervical pathology is common among HIV-positive women and that cytologic screening is not predictive of CIN in this population. In addition, the presence and severity of cervical dysplasia correlates with quantitative T-cell function. We strongly recommend that cervical colposcopy be part of the routine management of HIV-seropositive women."

Patients included had abnormal alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, detectable HCV RNA, and an interpretable liver biopsy. Demographic, epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, histological, and therapeutic data were recorded in all patients. We also registered the clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis (previous to biopsy) and whether the biopsy result deferred the decision of initiating therapy. During the 33-month duration of the study, 112 patients were included. The degree of fibrosis in liver biopsies was none or mild (F0 or F1) in 47 patients (42%) and was significant or severe in 65 (58%). Seventeen patients (15%) had histological cirrhosis. By logistic regression analysis, only portal hypertension (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 5.3 [1.05-25.9], P = 0.04) was independently associated with significant fibrosis. Overall, cirrhosis was predicted before biopsy in 29 patients (26%) by the caregiving physician, but only 8 of these were confirmed histologically. The clinical prediction of cirrhosis before biopsy had a sensitivity of 47%, a specificity of 78%, a positive predictive value of 28%, and a negative predictive value of 89%. Histological findings changed the decision to initiate HCV therapy in 19 patients (17%) because of little or no fibrosis. Liver biopsy is a useful tool in the management of HCV-HIV-coinfected persons. In addition to allowing grading and staging of the disease far better than any other method or combination of methods, it is important for making management decisions for patients coinfected with HCV and HIV."

In this study, we sought to identify nucleotide changes in the reverse transcriptase (RT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) at baseline and explore their predictive value for ADV antiviral response. Ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) was utilized to determine HBV genetic variability within the RT region at baseline and during a 48-week ADV therapy. According to the viral load at the end of ADV treatment, all patients were classified into responders (HBV DNA level reduction of ⩾ 3 log 10 IU/mL) and suboptimal responders (HBV DNA level reduction of <3 log 10 IU/mL). Based on UDPS data at baseline, we identified 11 nucleotide substitutions whose combination frequency was significantly associated with the antiviral response among 36 CHB patients in the study group. However, the baseline distribution and frequency of rt181 and rt236 substitutions known to confer ADV resistance was a poor predictor for the antiviral response. Compared with baseline serum HBeAg, HBV-DNA and ALT levels, the baseline HBV sequence-based model showed higher predictive accuracy for ADV response. In an independent cohort of 31 validation patients with CHB, the sequence-based model provided greater predictive potency than the HBeAg/HBV-DNA/ALT and the HBeAg/HBV-DNA/ALT/sequence combinations. Taken together, we confirm the presence of ADV resistance variants in treatment-naïve patients and firstly unravel the predictive value of the baseline mutations in the HBV RT region for ADV antiviral response."

One hundred and thirteen hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients with a normal or minimally elevated ALT level and moderate-to-severe histologic changes in their liver tissue were selected to receive peginterferon monotherapy and participate in a follow-up analysis. A multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that increasing age (P=.049) and lower hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels (P=.038) were associated with significant histological abnormalities in patients with a normal or minimally elevated ALT. Our predictive model which incorporated HBeAg testing at treatment week 12 combined with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) testing at treatment week 24 was able to identify which patients with a normal ALT level would achieve a sustained virological response (SVR) (positive predictive value [PPV]: 66.7%, negative predictive value [NPV]: 90.0%). Lower HBsAg and HBeAg levels at treatment week 24 were associated with a SVR in patients with a minimally elevated ALT level (PPV: 100.0%, NPV: 100.0%). A liver biopsy and antiviral therapy should be strongly considered when treating HBeAg-positive patients with a normal or minimally elevated ALT level, low HBV DNA level, and aged >35 years. On-treatment quantification of combined HBsAg and HBeAg test results may be useful for predicting a SVR to peginterferon monotherapy in these patients."

Necroinflammation and fibrosis was scored by the Ishak classification system, and binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess HIV and antiretroviral-related determinants of necroinflammation and fibrosis. A total of 46 biopsies were included; 33 were from HIV-positive patients co-infected with HCV and 15 biopsies were from HIV-positive patients co-infected with HBV. One HIV-positive patient was co-infected with HBV and HCV. Median biopsy inflammatory grade for the cohort was 8.5 (IQR 6-10), the median fibrosis Stage 2 (IQR 1.8-4), and the median steatosis score was 1 (IQR 0-2). At the univariate level, HIV-related variables that were significantly associated with more severe biopsy changes were higher HIV RNA at the time of biopsy (associated with inflammatory Grade 10+; P = 0.018) and any exposure to didanasine (ddI) or stavudine (D4T; associated with fibrosis Stage 3+; P = 0.022). HIV RNA at the time of biopsy remained significant at the multivariate level. Patients with HIV hepatitis co-infection in this cohort had surprisingly mild changes in liver histology, and there were no statistically significant differences between biopsy results in HBV compared to HCV co-infection. The association between HIV RNA and necroinflammation supports current recommendations for earlier initiation of HAART in patients with HIV-hepatitis co-infection."

6300,0.005,1.0000,"T cell activation levels, viral load and CD4(+) T cell counts at early stages of HIV-1 infection are predictive of the rate of progression towards AIDS. We evaluated whether the inflammatory profile during primary HIV-1 infection is predictive of the virological and immunological set-points and of disease progression. We quantified 28 plasma proteins during acute and post-acute HIV-1 infection in individuals with known disease progression profiles. Forty-six untreated patients, enrolled during primary HIV-1 infection, were categorized into rapid progressors, progressors and slow progressors according to their spontaneous progression profile over 42 months of follow-up. Already during primary infection, rapid progressors showed a higher number of increased plasma proteins than progressors or slow progressors. The plasma levels of TGF-β1 and IL-18 in primary HIV-1 infection were both positively associated with T cell activation level at set-point (6 months after acute infection) and together able to predict 74% of the T cell activation variation at set-point. Plasma IP-10 was positively and negatively associated with, respectively, T cell activation and CD4(+) T cell counts at set-point and capable to predict 30% of the CD4(+) T cell count variation at set-point. Moreover, plasma IP-10 levels during primary infection were predictive of rapid progression. In primary infection, IP-10 was an even better predictor of rapid disease progression than viremia or CD4(+) T cell levels at this time point. The superior predictive capacity of IP-10 was confirmed in an independent group of 88 HIV-1 infected individuals. Altogether, this study shows that the inflammatory profile in primary HIV-1 infection is associated with T cell activation levels and CD4(+) T cell counts at set-point. Plasma IP-10 levels were of strong predictive value for rapid disease progression. The data suggest IP-10 being an earlier marker of disease progression than CD4(+) T cell counts or viremia levels."

Understanding resistance to these inhibitors is important to maximize their efficacy. It has been shown that natural variation and covariation provide valuable insights into the development of resistance for established HIV inhibitors. Therefore, we have undertaken a study to fully characterize natural polymorphisms and amino acid covariation within an inhibitor-naïve sequence set spanning all defined HIV-1 subtypes. Inter- and intrasubtype variation was greatest in a 50-amino-acid segment of HIV-1 integrase incorporating the catalytic aspartic acid codon 116, suggesting that polymorphisms affect inhibitor binding and pathways to resistance. The critical mutations that determine the resistance pathways to raltegravir and elvitegravir (N155H, Q148K/R/H, and E92Q) were either rare or absent from the 1,165-sequence data set. However, 25 out of 41 mutations associated with integrase inhibitor resistance were present. These mutations were not subtype associated and were more prevalent in the subtypes that had been sampled frequently within the database. A novel modification of the Jaccard index was used to analyze amino acid covariation within HIV-1 integrase. A network of 10 covarying resistance-associated mutations was elucidated, along with a further 15 previously undescribed mutations that covaried with at least two of the resistance positions. The validation of covariation as a predictive tool will be dependent on monitoring the evolution of HIV-1 integrase under drug selection pressure."

Despite this quandary, few studies have assessed the relationship between the duration or extent of HIV-1 infection and the intrinsic neurobehavioral responsiveness to opioids. To address this problem, doxycycline (DOX)-inducible HIV-Tat(1-86) transgenic mice were used as a model for HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders, which permitted the regulation of Tat exposure and duration. The effects of continuous Tat induction on the activity of morphine were examined at weekly intervals using standard behavioral assays for nociception and motor function. In the spinal cord, Tat mRNA levels did not increase until the second and third weeks following induction, which corresponded to a significant loss of morphine antinociception as assessed in the tail-flick test. Alternatively, in the striatum, sustained increases in Tat mRNA expression during the second week of induction coincided with significant decreases in rotarod performance and interactions with morphine. Importantly, the behavioral effects of morphine differed depending on the timing and location of Tat expression, with increases in Tat transcript levels in the spinal cord and striatum corresponding to significant alterations in morphine-dependent nociception and rotarod performance, respectively. Assuming Tat levels contribute to the clinical manifestations of HIV-1, the results suggest that regional differences in viral load and opioid phenotype might influence the nature and degree that opiate responsiveness is altered in HIV-1-infected individuals."
1765,0.005,1.0000,"Because interruptions of antiretroviral treatment may entail clinical risks for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, we investigated their impact on neurocognitive functioning. Cross-sectional study was carried out, comparing HIV-infected persons who had interrupted antiretroviral therapy in the past (interruption group, IG) with persons who had never discontinued therapy (noninterruption group, NIG). Interruption was defined as the discontinuation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for more than 15 days after previous treatment of at least 15 days. All the participants were on therapy. Demographic, clinical, and neurocognitive variables were assessed. The primary end point was the percentage of people with neurocognitive impairment. The score in different neurocognitive domains was a secondary end point. A total of 83 subjects participated in the study (IG: n = 27; NIG: n = 56). Demographic and clinical characteristics were balanced between the groups, except for years since HIV diagnosis (IG, 13.8; NIG, 10.2 [P = .003]). The percentage of people with neurocognitive impairment was significantly higher in the IG group (IG, 59.25%; NIG, 33.92% [P = 0.02]). As for scores in neurocognitive domains, individuals in the IG showed worse neurocognitive functioning, and significant differences in attention/working memory and information processing speed were found. The adjusted analysis supported the unadjusted analysis. In this study, a higher prevalence of neurocognitive impairment was detected in HIV-infected persons who had interrupted antiretroviral therapy in the past. Additionally, neurocognitive functioning was observed to be more impaired in the same individuals. Further studies should examine the potential negative effects of antiretroviral therapy interruptions on neurocognitive functioning."

All patients have been tested for neurocognitive functioning through a comprehensive, five-domain neuropsychological battery performed in the study. Human cytokine (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor serum levels were quantified using ELISAs, and the hepatic fibrosis was estimated using the noninvasive Fibrosis 4 (FIB-4) score.

Using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), 329 HAART recipients were interviewed in May 2007. Questions on sociodemographic characteristics, chronic diseases (besides HIV/AIDS), HAART side effects and adherence to antiretroviral drugs were added. Treatment data, the first and latest available CD4 counts were retrieved from patients' records. Gender and age-adjusted mean scale scores of the sample were compared to those of the general Tanzanian population of the late 1990 s using t test. Logistic regression was used to explore the effect of sex, age, education level, income, chronic diseases, CD4 count, HAART side effects and adherence to antiretroviral drugs on recipients' physical functioning and mental health scale scores. The mean scale scores of HAART recipients were generally lower than those of the general population except for general health perceptions (p = 0.191) and mental health (p = 0.161). HAART recipients with chronic disease comorbidity were more likely to score below the general population's mean score for mental health (p = 0.007). While the effect of chronic disease comorbidity on physical functioning among those who recorded a CD4 count increase was negative (odds ratio [OR] = 13.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.7, 49.9), there was no effect on those who did not have such an increase. The control of chronic diseases among recipients should be given priority to improve their HRQOL."

Infants were subdivided according to their HIV serostatus and the clinical expression of the disease. Uninfected status (n = 92), late (>6 months, n = 18) and early (<3 months, n = 9) onset of symptoms among the HIV infected defined three groups. Infants with early symptoms showed the lowest median WA and LA Z-scores at all times and the LA difference with their uninfected counterparts was already significant at birth. Infants with late symptoms showed early differences in WL and then in WA also compared with the uninfected ones. A < -0.40 LA Z-score at birth gave a 5.9 relative risk (RR) to be an infant with early symptoms (95% CI = 1.2-27.4) while a negative WL Z-score at 2 months of age gave a 4.2 RR for the HIV seropositivity (95% CI = 2.1-8.3)."
2807,0.005,1.0000,"There is an urgent need for valid, reliable, and simple-to-use screening tools for HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in South Africa, as little is known about its impact on South Africa's 5.5 million people living with HIV (PLWH). Screening for HAD in South Africa involves several challenges, including few culturally appropriate and validated screening tools, and a shortage of trained personnel to conduct screening. This study examined rates of positive HAD screens as determined by the cutoff score on the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) administered by nonspecialist community health workers (CHWs) in South Africa and examined associations between positive HAD screens and common risk factors for HAD. Sixty-five Xhosa-speaking HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with low CD4 counts and documented ART adherence problems were administered a battery of demographic, psychiatric and neurocognitive screening measures. Positive HAD screens were present in 80% of the sample. Presence of a current alcohol dependence disorder and CD4 counts of 200 or lower were significantly associated with positive HAD screens. HIV-positive South Africans on ART with low CD4 counts and ART adherence problems may be at a very high risk for HAD, highlighting the need for more routine screening and monitoring of neurocognitive functions among South Africa's millions of PLWH on ART. Future research is needed to: (1) validate IHDS performance against a gold standard neurocognitive battery for the detection of HAD among larger samples of Xhosa-speaking South Africans with ART adherence difficulties and (2) compare performance of CHW to expert health care personnel in administering the IHDS."

This might influence neuropathogenesis by altering trafficking of monocytes into the CNS. A previous study suggested low rates of HIV-associated dementia in clade C-infected individuals. The present study evaluated neurocognitive impairment rates in clade B- and C-infected individuals from the same local population. HIV+ and HIV- participants were recruited from the same geographic region in Southern Brazil. We evaluated neuropsychological (NP) impairment using a screening instrument (the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS)), as well as a Brazilian Portuguese adaptation of a comprehensive battery that has demonstrated sensitivity to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) internationally. NP performance in controls was used to generate T scores and impairment ratings by the global deficit score (GDS) method. Clade assignments were ascertained by sequencing pol and env. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid were collected from all HIV+ participants. HIV+ and HIV- participants were comparable on demographic characteristics. HIV+ participants overall were more likely to be impaired than HIV- by the IHDS and the GDS. Clade B- and C-infected individuals were demographically similar and did not differ significantly in rates of impairment. The prevalence of pleocytosis, a marker of intrathecal cellular chemotaxis, also did not differ between clade B and C infections. Clade B and C HIV-infected individuals from the same geographic region, when ascertained using comparable methods, did not differ in their rates of neurocognitive impairment, and there was no evidence of differences in CNS chemotaxis."
80,0.005,1.0000,"The phenotype of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in the developed world has changed with the broad institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and with aging of the HIV+ population. Extrapyramidal motor signs were a prominent feature of HAND as defined in the early stages of the epidemic but has not been reevaluated in the era of HAART. Moreover, the contribution of aging to extrapyramidal motor signs in the context of HIV remains undefined. We examined these questions among the 229 HIV+ participants in the Hawaii Aging with HIV Cohort compared to age-, gender-, and ethnicity-matched HIV-negative controls. Extrapyramidal motor signs were quantified using the motor exam of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRSmotor) and compared to concurrent neuropsychological and clinical cognitive diagnostic categorization. The mean UPDRSmotor score increased with older age (1.68 versus 3.35; P<.001) and with HIV status (1.18 versus 3.56; P<.001). Age group (P=.024), HIV status (P<.001), and the interaction between age and HIV (P=.026) were significantly associated with UPDRSmotor score. Among HIV+ patients, the mean UPDRSmotor score increased with worsening cognitive diagnostic category (P<.001) where it was 2.06 (2.31) in normal cognition (n=110), 3.21 (3.48) in minor cognitive motor disorder (MCMD) (n=84), and 5.72 (5.01) in HIV-associated dementia (HAD) (n=37). We conclude that extrapyramidal motor signs are increased in HIV in the era of HAART and that the impact of HIV on extrapyramidal motor signs is exacerbated by aging. These results highlight the importance of a careful neurological examination in the evaluation of HIV patients."

Seropositivity was 21% in newly tested partners. Index cases chose patient referral for 25% of partners and referred 20% of eligible partners; the provider referred 71%. Index case acceptance of service, proportion of index cases with newly identified HIV positive partners, and choice of partner referral method were similar across groups. Gay men identified fewer partners, had a lower proportion of partners accepting new counselling and testing and referred a lower proportion of partners than heterosexual men. The total costs of the service were $19,496. Twelve new cases of HIV were identified through patient and provider referral and cost per case identified was $1625. Partner notification and provider referral should be offered to all HIV infected individuals in Colorado, as few differences across groups emerged and only 20% of located and eligible partners received counselling through patient referral."
16494,0.005,1.0000,"Interaction in vitro between cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and surrounding, uninfected, target cells often leads to cell fusion and the formation of multinucleated cells, called syncytia. The presence in HIV-infected individuals of virus strains able to induce syncytia in cultures of T cells is associated with disease progression and AIDS. Even in the asymptomatic stage of infection, multinucleated cells have been observed in different organs, indicating that fused cells may be generated and remain viable in the tissues of patients. We used lymphocytic cells transfected for the expression of the HIV-envelope (Env) glycoproteins to develop a method for the direct quantification of fusion events by flow cytometry (Huerta et al., 2006, J. Virol. Methods 138, 17-23; López-Balderas et al., 2007, Virus Res. 123, 138-146). The method involves the staining of fusion partners with lipophilic probes and the use of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to distinguish between fused and aggregated cells. We have shown that such a flow-cytometry assay is appropriate for the screening of compounds that have the potential to modulate HIV-Env-mediated cell fusion. Even those syncytia that are small or few in numbers can be detected. Quantitative analysis of the fusion products was performed with this technique; the results indicated that the time of reaction and initial proportion of fusion partners determine the number, relative size, and average cellular composition of syncytia. Heterogeneity of syncytia generated by HIV-Env-mediated cell-cell fusion may result in a variety of possible outcomes that, in turn, may influence the biological properties of the syncytia and surrounding cells, as well as replication of virus. Given the myriad immune abnormalities leading to AIDS, the full understanding of the extent, diverse composition, and role of fused cells in the pathogenesis of, and immune response to, HIV infection is an important, pending issue."
8727,0.005,1.0000,"The long asymptomatic stage of HIV infection poses a great challenge in identifying recent HIV infections. This is a bottleneck for monitoring HIV epidemic trends and evaluating the effectiveness of national AIDS control programs. Several serological methods were used to address this issue with some success. Because of high false-positive rates in patients with advanced infection or in ART treatment, UNAIDS still hesitates to recommend their use in routine surveillance. We developed a new pattern-based method for measuring intra-patient viral genetic diversity for determination of recent infections and estimation of population incidence. This method is verified by using several datasets (424 subtype B and 77 CRF07_BC samples) with clearly identified HIV-1 infection times. Pattern-based diversities of recent infections are significantly lower than that of chronic ones. With larger window periods varying from 200 to 350 days, a higher accuracy (90%-95%) not affected by advanced disease nor ART treatment could be obtained. The pattern-based genetic method is supplementary to the existing serology-based assays, both of which could be suitable for use in low and high epidemic regions, respectively."
16565,0.005,1.0000,"Knowledge of factors associated with medication adherence could help HIV clinicians to target persons in need of intervention, design these interventions, and help researchers to plan studies of adherence. This review summarizes the results of 20 studies investigating the issue of barriers to optimal highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence. Only a few determinants were consistently associated with nonadherence. Symptoms and adverse drug effects, psychologic distress, lack of social or family support, complexity of the HAART regimen, low patient self-efficacy, and inconvenience of treatment were the factors most consistently associated with nonadherence. There were inconsistent findings regarding the relationship of adherence and the following variables: sociodemographic characteristics, substance abuse, depressive symptoms, quality of life, CD4+ cell count, knowledge and beliefs about treatment, patients' satisfaction with health care, and patient-provider relationship. A synthesis of findings relating various factors to adherence to HAART is difficult to reach because of several limitations of the existing body of research. These limitations concern the measurement of adherence, the assessment of correlates and predictors of adherence, the study population, and the study design."
14963,0.005,1.0000,"In both clinical trials and clinical practice, nonadherence to medications is widespread among patients with chronic diseases. The shift to combination therapies for treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals has increased adherence challenges for both patients and health-care providers. Estimates of average rates of nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy range from 50% to 70%. Adherence rates of <80% are associated with detectable viremia in a majority of patients. The principal factors associated with nonadherence appear to be patient-related, including substance and alcohol abuse. However, other factors may also contribute, such as inconvenient dosing frequency, dietary restrictions, pill burden, and side effects; patient-health-care provider relationships; and the system of care. We discuss the major reasons reported by HIV-infected individuals for not taking their medications. Improving adherence probably requires clarifying the treatment regimen and tailoring it to patient lifestyles."
15360,0.005,1.0000,"Development of a safe and effective vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is urgent, but many concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of the currently developing vaccines remain. A major hindrance in HIV vaccine development is the genetic diversity, a hallmark of HIV biology, and a poor understanding of how HIV vaccine prevents the emergence of escape variants during infection and progression of AIDS. Here, we developed a method to construct a molecularly cloned viral library. This technique employs a long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify a virtually full-length HIV type 1 (HIV-1) provirus genome from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with CRF01_AE (subtype E) Thai primary isolate. Among randomly selected 93 clones, 41 with a full-length sequence were able to replicate in PBMCs, 5 of which induced strong cytopathic effects. Replication kinetics also showed that the parental virus was intermediate among the clones. Thus, the molecular library prepared by this method showed the quasi-species in infected cells and this method could provide a new possibility for the development of an order-made therapeutic vaccine against HIV-1."
4916,0.005,1.0000,"Primary factors that influence virus burden during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) disease progression remain a fundamental issue in pathogenesis. Because pneumococcal vaccine is routinely given to HIV-1-infected patients and replication of HIV-1 within CD4 T cells is dependent on the activation state of the cell, it was investigated whether the T cell activation that enhances the immune response to vaccines may also enhance HIV-1 replication. Vaccination of asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients led to rapid and significant increases in virus burden in some patients. The magnitude of these increases correlated significantly with the extent of the antibody response to the vaccination. Thus, antigenic stimulation by vaccines designed to prevent secondary infections may promote HIV-1 replication in certain patients. These findings provide a window for examining HIV-1 pathogenesis and for determining the appropriate preventive measures against other diseases in HIV-1-infected persons."

The surveys were returned by 154 (41%) health care professionals (RN = 99, NP = 5, PA = 7, MD = 39, other = 4). The average years in practice were 11. Only 7% of respondents were certified to provide state mandated HIV pretest counseling (certification not required for MD). Respondents reported caring for an average of 13 patients per week with suspected STD. Fifty-five percent of respondents reported that they always or usually warn STD patients of their HIV risk, yet only 10% always or usually encouraged these patients to consent to HIV testing in their emergency department (RN = 7%, NP = 25%, PA = 0%, MD = 16%). Reasons for not offering HIV testing in their emergency department were follow-up concerns (51%), not certified to provide pretest/posttest counseling (45%), and too time consuming (19%). Twenty-seven percent of respondents indicated HIV testing was not available in their emergency department despite all hospital laboratories reporting HIV testing capability. Ninety-three percent of respondents were aware that confidential testing sites were available, but only 35% always or usually referred patients not tested in the emergency department elsewhere for testing.

Between February 1984 and March 1988, 2073 of the Clinic's patients were tested for antibodies to HIV on 5095 occasions. Of those tested, 538 (26%) were positive for antibodies to HIV: 532 (98.9%) of the seropositives had practised male homosexual intercourse. This is the highest reported seroprevalence of HIV for any primary care service in Australia. Those individuals seropositive because of other risk behaviours were detected by voluntary contact tracing rather than by screening. Female prostitution was not found to be a risk factor for HIV. In general, rates of first HIV antibody tests were adversely affected by threatening legislation, and temporarily stimulated (among lower-risk persons) by a national television campaign. These data suggest that much of the counselling, detection and management of HIV infection in Australia is occurring in private practice, and that STD services (private and public) are at the forefront of the HIV epidemic. This has implications for disease surveillance and control, health services planning and medical education."

13025,0.005,1.0000,"Studies of heterosexual HIV transmission have consistently found anal intercourse to be a highly predictive risk factor for seroconversion. Yet most AIDS prevention messages targeted at heterosexuals, presumably influenced by cultural taboos against acknowledging this sexual practice, continue to emphasize vaginal and, increasingly, oral sex transmission. The health risks of anal sex appear to be severely underestimated by a substantial proportion of sexually active women and men in North and Latin America as well as parts of South Asia, Africa, and other regions. Among heterosexuals reported rates of condom use are nearly universally lower for anal than for vaginal intercourse. This review examines anal sex among the general population, including its prevalence in various world regions, related sociocultural factors, and other associated health problems including anorectal STDs, Hepatitis B infection, and HPV-related anal cancer in women. U.S. survey and other data suggest that, in terms of absolute numbers, approximately seven times more women than homosexual men engage in unprotected receptive anal intercourse. Research among higher risk subpopulations, including bisexual men, injecting drug users, female sex workers, inner-city adolescents, and serodiscordant heterosexual couples, indicates that persons particularly at risk of being infected by or transmitting HIV are also more likely to practice anal sex. Considering this finding, along with the much greater efficiency for HIV infection as well as lower rates of condom usage, a significant proportion of heterosexual transmission in some populations is due to anal intercourse. This typically stigmatized and hidden sexual practice must be given greater emphasis in AIDS/STD prevention, women's care, and other health promotion programs."
5865,0.005,1.0000,"There are about 400 million people with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection worldwide with a potential of adverse sequelae including hepatocellular carcinoma. Recent data have shown that the level of HBV DNA in serum or plasma of an infected person probably reflects more accurately the replicative activity of the virus and therefore may serve as a better maker for management of the infection. This study was designed to determine the rate of detection of HBV DNA in blood samples of patients with HBsAg positive in Nigeria in comparison with the HBe and anti-HBe used widely as serological markers of infectivity. Plasma samples from 105 patients with HBsAg positive were tested for the presence of HBeAg and anti-HBe using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay while plasma HBV DNA was quantified using the COBAS Amplicor HBV Monitor assay. Of the 105 HBsAg samples, 17 (16.2%) and 85 (81%) were positive for HBeAg and anti-HBe, respectively, while 8 (7.6%) were negative for both HBeAg and anti-HBe. HBV DNA was detected in 86 (81.9%) of the samples, out of which 15 (18.1%) and 67 (80.7%) were positive for HBeAg and anti-HBe, respectively. HBV DNA was detected in 78.4% of the HBeAg negative samples and in all the eight samples that were negative for both HBeAg and anti-HBe.

2265,0.005,1.0000,"Neutropenia frequently complicates infection due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The etiology of neutropenia in this setting includes bone marrow infection or infiltration, myelosuppressive therapies, the presence of antibodies to HIV, and accelerated apoptosis. Protection against microbial invaders by neutrophils is further compromised by impaired chemotaxis and phagocytosis, production of toxic oxygen species, and expression of cellular adhesion molecules. Neutropenia is a significant risk factor for bacterial infection in HIV-infected patients. Endogenous cytokines, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, regulate neutrophil count and function. Treatment with recombinant human methionyl G-CSF (filgrastim) has lessened neutropenia in patients with HIV infection. Clinical trials have shown that the incidence of bacterial infections and the number of consequent days of hospitalization for HIV-infected patients receiving filgrastim therapy are lower. Filgrastim treatment also allows administration of larger doses of myelosuppressive agents."
17421,0.005,1.0000,"Neutrophils dominate acute inflammatory responses that generally evolve into chronic inflammatory reactions mediated by monocyte/macrophages and lymphocytes. The latter cell types also serve as major targets for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In this study we have investigated the role of neutrophil products, particularly cathepsin G, in HIV infection. Cathepsin G induced chemotaxis and production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages but not CD4(+) T cells. Pretreatment with cathepsin G markedly increased susceptibility of macrophages but not CD4(+) T cells to acute HIV-1 infection. When macrophages were exposed to pertussis toxin prior to cathepsin G treatment, the cathepsin G-mediated effect was almost abrogated, suggesting that enhancement of HIV-1 replication by cathepsin G requires Gi protein-mediated signal transduction. Although prolonged exposure to cathepsin G suppressed HIV infection of macrophages, serine protease inhibitors, which are exuded from the bloodstream later during inflammatory processes, neutralized the inhibitory effect. Neutrophil extracts or supernatants from neutrophil cultures, which contain cathepsin G, had effects similar to purified cathepsin G. Thus, cathepsin G, and possibly other neutrophil-derived serine proteases, may have multiple activities in HIV-1 infection of macrophages, including chemoattraction of monocyte/macrophages (HIV-1 targets) to inflamed tissue, activation of target cells, and increase in their susceptibility to acute HIV-1 infection."

Phagocytosis and oxidative burst were evaluated using commercially available kits. Results clearly denote a significant decrease of the phagocytic function of both cell types of groups B and C compared with group A. Among group C patients, those in the upper quartile of CD4 increase had higher oxidative burst compared with patients of the other quartiles. In addition, comparisons clearly showed a lower degree of phagocytic function and of oxidative burst of both monocytes and neutrophils of group D compared with group B. Finally, it was found that monocyte and neutrophil function was correlated inversely to the change in viral load, i.e. the greater the decrease of viral load, the better the phagocytic and oxidative activity. Innate immunity defects appear to be present in HIV-positive patients, regarding phagocytic activity and oxidative burst of monocytes and neutrophils. These defects are greatly influenced by the level of treatment efficacy, with emphasis on CD4 cell counts and viral load."
10816,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 infection is associated with a progressive loss of T cell functional capacity and reduced responsiveness to antigenic stimuli. The mechanisms underlying T cell dysfunction in HIV-1/AIDS are not completely understood. Multiple studies have shown that binding of program death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on the surface of monocytes and dendritic cells to PD-1 on T cells negatively regulates T cell function. Here we show that neutrophils in the blood of HIV-1-infected individuals express high levels of PD-L1. PD-L1 is induced by HIV-1 virions, TLR-7/8 ligand, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and IFNα. Neutrophil PD-L1 levels correlate with the expression of PD-1 and CD57 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, elevated levels of neutrophil degranulation markers in plasma, and increased frequency of low density neutrophils (LDNs) expressing the phenotype of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs). Neutrophils purified from the blood of HIV-1-infected patients suppress T cell function via several mechanisms including PD-L1/PD-1 interaction and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Collectively, the accumulated data suggest that chronic HIV-1 infection results in an induction of immunosuppressive activity of neutrophils characterized by high expression of PD-L1 and an inhibitory effect on T cell function.

18538,0.005,1.0000,"Patients at the same stage of chronic disease may have had different rates of disease progression. The authors developed a mathematical modeling approach that allows reconstructing and comparing populations in terms of the disease progression rates of their participants when the disease onset and progression rates are unknown for individual patients. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection was used as an example. Both published and hypothetical models were used to describe the human immunodeficiency virus 1 epidemic (epidemic heterogeneity) and incubation and survival functions for different disease stages (individual heterogeneity). Reconstructions of populations with late disease (e.g., acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients) show a marked predominance of rapid progressors, unless the incidence of new infections has been decreasing for a long time. Rapid progressors would also predominate in populations of acute seroconverters, unless diagnosis is based on repeated serologic screening rather than symptoms. Populations of patients who have not progressed beyond an early stage of the disease (e.g., patients with CD4 cell counts > 500/microliter) tend to overrepresent slow progressors, especially if the epidemic has been decreasing for a long time. With this approach, one can assess whether the target population of a clinical trial is comparable with other patient populations at different places and times. Epidemic and individual diversity may even affect trial results if patients with different progression rates experience different benefits from a treatment. By modeling the targeted populations in trials of early versus deferred antiretroviral treatment, the authors observed larger treatment benefits in trials in which rapid progressors probably predominated, compared with trials of slow progressors."

We have examined the incidence, associations and prognostic significance of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies in individuals with HIV infections. One hundred and five patients, with asymptomatic infections (n = 37), AIDS-related complex (n = 32) or AIDS (n = 36) were studied. Plasma from 24 of these (23%) were positive for ANA: most demonstrated speckled fluorescence (n = 21) and were of low titre (1+ in 18). ANCA were demonstrated by IIF in 18 individuals (17%) and all fluorescent patterns were seen; 6 of these plasma were also positive in the ELISAs for antibodies to proteinase 3, myeloperoxidase or elastase. Thirteen plasma were positive for ANCA in the neutrophil cytoplasm ELISA; 10 of these were also positive in the specific ELISAs. A total of 30 plasma bound to proteinase 3, myeloperoxidase or elastase in specific ELISAs, in 6 cases with 2 specificities. Finally, 18 plasma (17%) contained anti-GBM antibodies by ELISA, but none of 4 plasma tested in inhibition assays was specific. ANA, ANCA and anti-GBM antibodies were not uncommon in HIV-infected individuals but the presence of these antibodies was not associated with the clinical manifestations of the corresponding autoimmune diseases. In addition, there was no correlation between the demonstration of these antibodies and the immunological status of the individual (apart from a correlation between CD4 counts less than 400/microliters with anti-GBM antibodies), the presence of an opportunistic infection, the development of malignancy or reduced survival. Some of these antibodies may arise from polyclonal activation, or be due to ""sticky"" serum since we have shown that the presence of anti-GBM antibodies correlated with the demonstration of ANCA by ELISA. These antibodies are not more common in hypergammaglobulinemic plasma but some may be due to heat-treatment of the plasma. The clinician caring for HIV-infected individuals needs to be aware of these ""false-positive"" antibody results."

A comprehensive analysis of HCV-specific T cell responses was performed at two time points during acute HCV infection using a T cell expansion assay with overlapping peptide pools spanning the entire HCV genome Three patients with (near) normal CD4+ T cell counts (range 400-970 x 10(6)/L) either resolved (n=1) or temporary suppressed HCV RNA. In contrast, one patient with low CD4+ T cell counts (330 x 10(6)/L), had sustained high HCV RNA levels. All four patients had low HCV-specific CD8+ T cell responses, and similar magnitudes of CD4+ T cell responses. Interestingly, individuals with resolved infection or temporary suppression of HCV-RNA had HCV-specific CD4+ T cell responses predominantly against nonstructural (NS) proteins. While the individual with high HCV RNA plasma concentrations had CD4+ T cell responses predominantly directed against Core. Our data show that an acute HCV infection in an HIV-1 infected person can be suppressed in the presence of HCV-specific CD4+ T cell response targeting non-structural proteins. However further research is needed in a larger group of patients to evaluate the role of HIV-1 on HCV-specific T cell responses in relation to outcome of acute HCV infection."

The occurrence of pyomyositis complicating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been reported in 10 patients since 1986. We report six cases of this entity in patients with advanced HIV disease seen in our institution over a 20-month period. A common denominator in all of our patients was muscle injury, induced by either exercise or trauma. Unlike most previous reports of HIV-associated pyomyositis, the clinical picture in our cases was complicated by the development of abscesses in multiple muscle groups, requiring prolonged antimicrobial therapy and repeated drainage procedures for successful management. Interestingly, one patient developed concomitant rhabdomyolysis--an otherwise rare event in classical pyomyositis. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant infecting organism in this as well as all other series. Of note, we also observed and report the first case, to our knowledge, of gram-negative pyomyositis in an HIV-infected individual. The pathogenic implications of this catalase-producing gram-negative isolate are discussed in the context of neutrophil abnormalities in HIV disease."

In Brazil, the Domiciliary Therapeutic Assistance is a multidisciplinary and integrated home-based assistance program provided for HIV+ patients confined in their homes due to physical deficiency. This study investigated ADT's ability to monitor and promote appropriate adherence to ARV therapy. Fifty-six individuals were recruited from three study groups: Group 1 -- patients currently in the ADT program, Group 2 -- 21 patients previously treated by the ADT program, and Group 3 -- 20 patients who have always been treated using conventional ambulatory care. Using multivariable self-reporting to evaluate adherence, patients in the ADT program had significantly better adherence than patients in ambulatory care (F = 6.66, p = 0.003). This effect was independent of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics as well as medical history. Patients in the ADT program also showed a trend towards greater therapeutic success than ambulatory patients. These results suggest the incorporation of characteristics of ADT in conventional ambulatory care as a strategy to increase adherence to ARV therapy."

The sample comprised 190 participants enrolled in a randomized trial of a case management intervention. Participants were interviewed about their backgrounds, housing status, income, alcohol and drug use problems, health status and depressive symptoms at study entry. Electronic medical records were used to assess medical service use. Poisson regression models were tested to determine the effects of need, enabling and predisposing factors on the dependent variables of emergency department visits, inpatient admissions and ambulatory care visits. During a two-year period, 71% were treated in the emergency department, 64% had been hospitalized and the sample averaged 12.9 ambulatory care visits. Homelessness was associated with higher utilization of emergency department and inpatient services; drug use severity was associated with higher inpatient and ambulatory care service use; and alcohol use severity was associated with greater use of emergency medical services. Homelessness and substance abuse exacerbate the health care needs of HIV-infected persons and result in increased use of emergency department and inpatient services. Interventions are needed that target HIV-infected persons with substance abuse disorders, particularly those that increase entry and retention in outpatient health care and thus decrease reliance on acute hospital-based services."

The purpose of this study was to describe and to compare the characteristics of patient admissions during two periods, one pre HAART and the other when HAART was fully available. A retrospective analysis of demographic data, ambulatory care information and hospitalization characteristics was performed. Causes of admission, outcome, mortality, length of hospitalization and type of antiretroviral therapy were analyzed. A total of 330 medical records were reviewed, corresponding to 522 admissions during both study periods: 1995-96 (n = 289) and 2001-02 (n = 233). The most frequent causes of hospitalization were AIDS defining events (period 1: 57.1%; period 2: 59.7%). Tuberculosis was the main cause of admission in both periods (23.9% and 15.5%). Criptococosis (3.5%-7.3%), Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (5.9%-9.4%), and CNS toxoplasmosis (6.9 -8.6%) followed tuberculosis. Mortality did not vary significantly (13.5%-16.1%). HIV-1 infection was diagnosed at admission in 30% of cases. During 2nd period, a significant decrease in re-admission (41.6-26.8%) was observed, whereas there was an increase in the percentage of patients with previous antiretroviral treatment on admission (8%-25%). An increase in the ambulatory care clinic consultations (1995: n = 1678; 1996: n = 2512; 2001: n = 5670; 2002: n = 7074) was observed.

Approximately 70% of the caretakers stated that their children participated in the OHAP, however 20% of them did not return to the recall appointments; such visits were even less frequent when the caretakers were not the parents themselves (p= 0.036). The adherence of this population to dental treatment outside the OHP was small, 48% of the caretakers stated that the child did not conclude the treatment when referred to another place for treatment. The attitude of the caretakers regarding dental care of HIV+ children was not considered satisfactory.

Patient clinical and health care data came from 1987-1992 New York State (NYS) Medicaid files and clinic data came from interviews of clinic directors. The HIV/AIDS experience of each study patient's clinic was measured as the annual number of Medicaid enrollees newly diagnosed with AIDS who were contemporaneously followed by the patient's clinic. Repeated ED use was observed for 24%. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of repeated ED visits was reduced for patients in clinics with a physician on-call (0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.65, 0.92), evening or weekend clinic hours (0.77; 95% CI = 0.64, 0.93), or >50 AIDS patients/year in 1987-1988 (0.56; 95% CI = 0.44, 0.71) versus fewer patients in those years. Patients in clinics with more than one feature promoting accessibility or HIV expertise had a greater reduction in their AOR of repeated ED use.

Patient-specific challenges associated with the delivery of TB/HIV care have been minimally explored in this regard. As part of a larger study conducted in South Africa, this article highlights coinfected patients' experiences with TB and HIV healthcare in light of their broader social environments. Qualitative, in-depth interviews were conducted with 40 adult, coinfected patients (24 women and 16 men) and eight key-informant healthcare workers at three urban/peri-urban, ambulatory, public health clinics in the high-burden province of KwaZulu-Natal. Transcribed interviews were analyzed under a modified grounded theory approach to capture subjective meanings of healthcare experience subsequent to patients' codiagnosis with TB and HIV. Emerging analytic themes highlighted critical sociomedical constraints to TB/HIV care in relation to patients' income and employment, eligibility for social assistance and antiretroviral treatment, fears around illness disclosure, social and material support, and treatment adherence. Patients' healthcare experiences were bound by their poor access to essential resources, multiple life responsibilities, disparate gender roles, limits within the healthcare system, and the stigmatizing social symbolism of their illness. Overlapping social inequalities perpetuated coinfected patients' experiences with stigma and collectively mediated their health decisions around disclosure, adherence, and retention in medical care. The study urges a contextualized understanding of the social challenges associated with TB/HIV healthcare and helps inform more patient-sensitive and socially responsive interventions against the co-epidemic."

Extreme sampling techniques were used to recruit four HIV-positive gay men who are enrolled in a research project that is examining factors related to disease progression in HIV infection but who do not otherwise receive any health care. Intensive, open-ended interviews were conducted, and the interviews were analyzed for recurring themes. Results indicate that the participants did not have an accurate perception of health care and therefore were hesitant in seeking health care. Part of this hesitation involved their strong reluctance to begin antiretroviral therapy. Enrollment in a longitudinal study allowed the participants to have some monitoring of their HIV infection. However, not having a primary care provider resulted in a lack of preparedness when they encountered changes in their health status. The end result of this process was progression in their HIV disease. Implications for clinicians and researchers are discussed."
13776,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) account for millions of cases of vertical infections worldwide. Laboratory diagnosis is essential for the detection of potentially infectious carriers. HBeAg represents the best serological marker for HBV replication. Since 10% of HBeAg-negative carriers transmit the virus to their children, determination of viral DNA is more reliable for the assessment of the risk to vertical infection. Risk assessment of vertical HIV transmission and monitoring AZT therapy during pregnancy are achieved by determination of HIV-1 viral load and CD4+ cell count. HIV-1 RNA or cDNA detection permits a nearly 100% sensitive diagnosis of congenital HIV infection already 2 weeks after birth. While qualitative HBV DNA determination should be limited only to anti-HBe carriers in order to assess infectiosity, HIV-1 RNA measurement represents in combination with the CD4+ cell count the best prognostic marker for vertical HIV infection and for the follow-up of infected children."

LTNP status was defined as an asymptomatic HIV infection for at least 8 years, a stability of CD4+ cell counts > or =600 cells/mm3 and no antiretroviral therapy. LTNP subjects exhibited a lower median plasma RNA load than controls (6,000 vs. 40,000 RNA copies/ ml) despite a wide range of values in both groups. When compared to the control group, LTNP subjects also exhibited a lower virus isolation rate (65% vs. 100%) and cell-associated viremia (0.75 vs. 56.8 number of infectious unit/ million cells) when CD8-depleted CD4+ cells were tested. By contrast, no major differences in virus replication properties or cell tropism were observed. After 1 year of follow-up, no major overall changes in the virological parameters was observed in the 50 LTNP subjects evaluated at this time. However, nine patients had started antiretroviral therapy, and six others had increased viral loads.

11229,0.005,1.0000,"The woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) was the first of the mammalian and avian hepadnaviruses described after discovery of the virus of hepatitis B (HBV). Woodchucks chronically infected with WHV develop progressively severe hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, which present as lesions that are remarkably similar to those associated with HBV infection in humans. The initial virological studies and studies of pathogenesis utilized woodchucks that had been trapped in the wild and had acquired WHV infection naturally. Research with wild woodchucks was complicated by lack of knowledge of their backgrounds (e.g., dietary history, exposure to parasites or environmental toxins, and source and duration of WHV infection). Breeding colonies of woodchucks have been established and maintained in laboratory animal facilities, and laboratory-reared woodchucks are superior for experimental studies of pathogenesis or hepatocarcinogenesis. It is possible to infect neonatal woodchucks born in the laboratory with standardized inocula and produce a high rate of chronic WHV carriers that are useful for controlled investigations. WHV has been shown experimentally to cause hepatocellular carcinoma, supporting conclusions based on epidemiological and molecular virological studies that HBV is an important etiological factor in human hepatocarcinogenesis. Chronic WHV carrier woodchucks have become a valuable animal model for the preclinical evaluation of antiviral therapy for HBV infection, providing useful pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results in a relevant animal disease model. It also has been shown that the pattern of toxicity and hepatic injury observed in woodchucks treated with certain fluorinated pyrimidines is remarkably similar to that observed in humans that were treated with the same drugs, suggesting the woodchuck has significant potential for the preclincial assessment of antiviral drug toxicity."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of trak-C as an additional laboratory diagnostic marker of viraemia. The performance was compared to HCV-RNA detection in the ""screening"" of sera from a large heterogeneous population of hospitalised patients and outpatients. Six hundred and eighteen anti-HCV negative sera, 405 anti-HCV positive/HCV-RNA negative sera, 604 anti-HCV positive/HCV-RNA positive sera and 67 anti-HCV negative sera containing antigens or antibodies potentially interfering with the performance of the assay were analysed. Supplemental HCV antibody testing was performed using a commercial strip immunoblot assay. HCV-RNA was investigated using a qualitative commercial assay. A quantitative commercial RT-PCR was used for the analysis of selected samples. Sensitivity and specificity values were 94.7 and 100%, respectively. The latter was also confirmed when anti-HCV negative samples containing potentially interfering antigens/antibodies were examined. Sensitivity below 100% was probably due to an antigenaemia below the detection limit of trak-C. Besides, because 65.6% of HCV-RNA positive/trak-C negative samples presented specific antibodies against all four RIBA antigens, the hypothesis was raised that, in some cases, the dissociation step efficiency could be sub-optimal. In conclusion, trak-C seems suitable for identifying HCV infection on large based populations. It is a rapid to perform, reliable and specific assay that can be adapted to any laboratory setting."

Twenty-six HIV-infected, 14 seroreverted, and 20 control (non-HIV-exposed) children were studied; the sample consisted of nonreferred children living in foster placement who had been exposed to maternal drug addiction. Each child received a psychiatric diagnostic evaluation which included completion by the caretaker of a structured diagnostic interview and a behavior checklist on the child as well as a child self-report on a pictorial interview. Age, ethnicity, and IQ were controlled in the analyses because of group differences. There were high rates of behavioral and psychiatric morbidity, especially with respect to disruptive behavior disorders, in this sample of school-age children with HIV infection, but similarly high rates were found in the seroreverted and non-HIV-exposed children. There was some suggestion that the HIV-infected children were experiencing higher levels of subjective distress than either the nonexposed or seroreverted children. The possible relevance of drug exposure to the behavioral outcomes observed here is discussed, as well as the importance of using age-appropriate materials to elicit subjective distress in HIV-infected school-age children.

In a country such as South Africa where rates of these infectious diseases are high, it is concerning that there is limited/no data on prevalence rates of mental disorders such as PTSD and its associated factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of PTSD symptoms and associated factors in TB, TB retreatment and/or TB-HIV co-infected primary public health-care patients in three districts in South Africa. Brief screening self-report tools were used to measure: PTSD symptoms, psychological distress (anxiety and depression) and alcohol misuse. Other relevant measures, such as adherence to medication, stressful life events and sexual risk-taking behaviours, were obtained through structured questions. A total of 4900 public primary care adult patients from clinics in high TB burden districts from three provinces in South Africa participated. All the patients screened positive for TB (either new or retreatment cases). The prevalence of PTSD symptoms was 29.6%. Patients who screened positive for PTSD symptoms and psychological distress were more likely to be on antidepressant medication. Factors that predicted PTSD symptoms were poverty, residing in an urban area, psychological distress, suicide attempt, alcohol and/or drug use before sex, unprotected sex, TB-HIV co-infected and the number of other chronic conditions. Health-care systems should be strengthened to improve delivery of mental health care, by focusing on existing programmes and activities, such as those which address the prevention and treatment of TB and HIV.

The majority of cases occurred in residents of Roka commune. The Cambodian National Center for HIV/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), Dermatology and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (NCHADS) investigated the outbreak in collaboration with the University of Health Sciences in Phnom Penh and members of the Roka Cluster Investigation Team. By February 28, 2015, NCHADS had confirmed 242 cases of HIV infection among the 8,893 commune residents, an infection rate of 2.7%. Molecular investigation of the HIV strains present in this outbreak indicated that the majority of cases were linked to a single HIV strain that spread quickly within this community. An NCHADS case-control study identified medical injections and infusions as the most likely modes of transmission. In response to this outbreak, the Government of Cambodia has taken measures to encourage safe injection practices by licensed medical professionals, ban unlicensed medical practitioners, increase local capacity for HIV testing and counseling, and expand access to HIV treatment in Battambang province. Measures to reduce the demand for unnecessary medical injections and the provision of unsafe injections are needed. Estimates of national HIV incidence and prevalence might need to be adjusted to account for unsafe injection as a risk exposure. "
16205,0.005,1.0000,"The authors examined levels of psychosocial distress and well-being in 65 gay or bisexual men infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); 24 of these men had asymptomatic HIV infection, 22 had acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex, and 19 had AIDS. All of the men evidenced high levels of psychosocial distress, but those with AIDS-related complex and those with asymptomatic HIV infection were significantly more distressed than those with AIDS. Corresponding differences were not observed in feelings of psychosocial well-being. The authors conclude that specific psychosocial issues and adaptive demands should be identified over the course of HIV illness."
13262,0.005,1.0000,"A case control study was conducted to identify the association of therapeutic injections with acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Karachi, Pakistan. We enrolled 67 cases of acute HBV infection (IgM anti-HBc positive) and 247 controls (anti-HBc negative) from four hospitals of Karachi during July 2000-June 2001. Exposure to various risk factors during the period relevant to the incubation period of HBV was recorded both from cases and controls using a structured questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the data showed that cases were more likely to have received one injection (OR = 4.0; 95 % CI 1.4, 11.1), or more than one injection (OR = 6.3; 95 % CI 3.2, 12.4) compared to controls. The estimated population attributable risk (PAR) for therapeutic injections was 53%. Also the cases compared to controls were more likely to have household size of seven or more (OR = 1.9; 95 % CI 0.95, 3.9). This study showed that unsafe therapeutic injections appear to be the major risk factor for acute HBV infection and needs immediate focus from public health stand point."
9763,0.005,1.0000,"Severity criteria for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) have always excluded patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A 1-yr, multicenter, prospective observational study of HIV-infected patients with bacterial CAP was done to validate the criteria used in the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for CAP, and to determine the prognosis-associated factors in the HIV-infected population with bacterial CAP. Overall, 355 cases were included, with an attributable mortality of 9.3%. Patients who met the ATS criteria had a longer hospital stay (p = 0.01), longer duration of fever (p < 0.001), and higher attributable mortality (13.1% versus 3.5%, p = 0.02) than those who did not. Three factors were independently related to mortality: CD4(+) cell count < 100/microl, radiologic progression of disease, and shock. Pleural effusion, cavities, and/or multilobar infiltrates at admission were independently associated with radiologic progression. A prognostic rule based on the five criteria of shock, CD4(+) cell count < 100/microl, pleural effusion, cavities, and multilobar infiltrates had a high negative predictive value for mortality (97.1%). The attributable mortality for severe pneumonia was 11.3%, as compared with 1.3% for nonsevere disease (p = 0.008). The ATS severity criteria are valid in HIV-infected patients with bacterial CAP. Our study provides the basis for identification of patients who may require hospitalization determined by clinical judgment and the five clinical criteria of shock, a CD4(+) cell count < 100/microl, pleural effusion, cavities, and multilobar involvement. These prognostic factors should be validated in independent cohort studies."
7744,0.005,1.0000,"In the past 5 yr, an increased incidence of tuberculosis has been noted in the United States. Simultaneously, the population infected with human immunodeficiency virus-type I (HIV-I) and the number of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have increased. Selected areas of the United States have also reported increases in the frequency of drug-resistant isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Because our institution serves a population in which tuberculosis, AIDS, and drug resistant isolates of M. tuberculosis are frequently encountered, we sought to better define interrelationships among these factors by retrospectively reviewing the demographic, clinical, bacteriologic, and radiologic data for all adult patients in whom M. tuberculosis was isolated from a culture of respiratory-tract secretions during a 1-year period (June 1, 1988 to May 31, 1989). Two hundred forty-six patients were thus identified; 66.5% were U.S. born blacks, and 62.6% were 17 to 40 yr of age. Risk factors for HIV infection were present in 106 patients. The overall resistance rate (one or more drugs) = 30.9%, with primary resistance = 22.6% (35 of 155) and secondary resistance = 49.2% (29 of 59). In addition, 12 resistant isolates were found in 32 patients whose prior treatment status was indeterminate. Of the resistant isolates, 56.6% (43 of 76) were multiply resistant. Isoniazid resistance was noted in 90.7% (69 of 76) and rifampin resistance was noted in 50% (38 of 76) of the resistant isolates. No significant differences in the overall frequency of resistance were noted in patients at risk for HIV infection compared with those without these risks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

5828,0.005,1.0000,"Both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are more common in HIV-infected individuals than in the general population as a result of shared risk factors for viral acquisition. Populations of injecting drug users are at particularly high risk for HIV/HCV co-infection. Co-infection with HIV results in greater likelihood of chronicity and enhanced viral replication in the setting of both HBV and HCV infections. Current evidence suggests that HIV infection may have a negative impact on HBV-related liver disease progression, although the mechanisms for this are unclear. HBV seems to have little impact on the progression of HIV disease. HIV co-infection hastens HCV-related liver disease with faster progression to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. There is still conflicting evidence on the impact of HCV on HIV progression with inconsistent results from cohort studies. Long-term follow-up of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-treated patients will help elucidate this further. Antiretroviral agents have little long-term impact on HCV viraemia, although some have significant anti-HBV activity. Morbidity and mortality from end-stage liver disease in HIV-infected individuals is increasing and every effort should be made to identify, educate and treat as appropriate those with HBV or HCV co-infection."
4964,0.005,1.0000,"In HIV-infected men, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is strongly linked with the development of anogenital lesions but is not a sufficient factor to explain the neoplastic transformation of such lesions. We investigated the association between HPV and herpesvirus infections in penile and anal lesions from 54 HIV-seronegative and 54 HIV-seropositive men by means of colposcopy, histopathology and in situ hybridization. Our patients showed condyloma acuminata (39%), papular warts (35%) and macular warts (26%). High-grade lesions were predominant in the HIV+ men, whereas low-grade lesions were more frequent in the HIV- men. In the HIV+ group, potential oncogenic HPV were the most frequently detected (83.4%) whereas the ""low-risk"" HPV were found chiefly in HIV- men (62.1%). The CD4 number was lower in patients showing ""high-risk"" HPV than in men showing lesions without HPV or with non-oncogenic HPV. HPV types 6/11 were found mainly associated with koilocytosis or with AIN(PIN)I. Oncogenic HPV were more often detected in AIN(PIN)II-III. The herpesviruses DNA detection revealed a higher prevalence of HSVI and -2 than CMV and EBV in the studied biopsies. The frequency of HSV and CMV detection was higher in the HIV+ than in the HIV- men. A link was found between the ""high-risk"" HPV and the CMV detection whatever the population considered. The detection in HPV lesions of other sexually transmitted viral agents could therefore represent an important means of preventing progression of the anogenital disease, especially in immunosuppressed patients."
18690,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) in prostate cancer (PCa) patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This is a prospective cohort study of HIV patients undergoing RALP, comparing the demographics, tumor characteristics, complications, and short-term oncological outcomes of HIV-positive men to HIV-negative men using univariate (χ(2), Mann-Whitney test) and multivariable (logistic regression) analyses. From 2007 to 2010, 298 men underwent RALP, 8 of whom were known to be HIV positive. Preoperatively, all eight were taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and had undetectable viral loads (<50); mean CD4 count was 634 cells per mm(3). HIV-positive men were younger (54 versus 62 years, P=0.010) and less likely to be white (P=0.007). There were no significant differences between groups with respect to clinical staging, pathological and oncological outcomes or most complication rates. However, the prevalence of perioperative transfusions (P=0.031) and ileus (P=0.021) were higher in HIV-positive patients. HIV remained significantly associated with risk of transfusion after adjustment for age, race, Gleason sum and clinical T stage (P=0.002). After a median of 2.6 (range 0.03-19.2) months of follow-up, PSA remained undetectable in all eight HIV patients. These data suggest that RALP is safe for, and demonstrates short-term oncological efficacy in, HIV-positive patients with PCa."
12245,0.005,1.0000,"Therapeutic concentrations of antiretroviral agents in seminal plasma (SP) may reduce virus burden and influence sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1. This study compared the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and dose responses of efavirenz (EFV) in SP versus those in blood plasma (BP). A total of 431 BP samples and 157 SP samples were obtained over a period of 40 days, from 9 EFV-naive men (i.e., men about to receive EFV for the first time) and from 12 EFV-experienced men (i.e., men already receiving EFV as part of an antiretroviral regimen). Overall, median EFV exposure in SP was 3.4% (range, 2.0%-5.0%) of that in BP. However, all EFV concentrations in SP were >/=40-fold higher than the wild-type IC(90) (IC(90)(WT)) for HIV-1. During the dosing interval, no single SPrcolon;BP EFV-concentration ratio was significantly predictive of the absolute measure of exposure in SP. By day 40, HIV-1 RNA in SP was undetectable in 8 (89%) of 9 EFV-naive men and remained undetectable in 10 (83%) of 12 EFV-experienced men. In SP, EFV reaches concentrations above the HIV-1 IC(90)(WT) throughout the dosing interval. EFV-containing regimens effectively suppress HIV-1 RNA in SP."
6765,0.005,1.0000,"To determine whether total energy expenditure (TEE) is increased in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) lipodystrophy syndrome, we compared energy expenditure (EE) and substrate oxidation rates in 12 HIV-infected men with lipodystrophy, 7 HIV-infected men without lipodystrophy, and 14 healthy controls. TEE and nutrient oxidation rates were assessed by whole-room indirect calorimetry. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured by indirect calorimetry using the open-circuit technique. Body composition was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Insulin sensitivity was measured using the insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. TEE adjusted for lean body mass (LBM) was significantly higher in the HIV-infected group with lipodystrophy compared to HIV-infected patients without lipodystrophy (2,873.3 +/- 69 v 2,573.9 +/- 92 kcal/d, P =.02) and compared to healthy controls (2,873.3 +/- 69 v 2,404.0 +/- 64 kcal/d, P <.001). REE and sleeping metabolic rate (SMR) adjusted for LBM were also significantly higher in the HIV-infected group with lipodystrophy compared to both HIV-infected and healthy controls. Carbohydrate oxidation rates adjusted for LBM were higher in men with HIV lipodystrophy as compared to healthy controls (362.5 +/- 23 v 250.0 +/- 22 g/d, P = <.01) and tended to be higher as compared to HIV-infected controls (362.5 +/- 23.6 v 297.3 +/- 31 g/d, P =.1). In conclusion, TEE and carbohydrate oxidation are increased in the HIV lipodystrophy syndrome. The increase in TEE appears to be due to increases in REE. The pathogenesis of elevated EE in HIV lipodystrophy and other forms of lipodystrophy remains to be determined."
19501,0.005,1.0000,"The aims of this study were to assess the long-term efficacy of lamivudine (LAM) plus adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) combination therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B resistant to LAM, to identify predictive factors of complete viral response (HBV-DNA <2.6  log  copies/ml at 12 months of combination therapy), and to analyze amino acid substitutions associated with treatment resistance in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome. Seventy-two patients who received ADV in addition to LAM for breakthrough hepatitis were enrolled. Undetectable HBV-DNA was observed in 61%, 74%, 81%, 84%, and 85% at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months of combination therapy, respectively. On multivariate analysis, undetectable HBV-DNA during the preceding LAM monotherapy (P < 0.0001), alanine aminotransferase value  ≥  the upper limit of normal × 6 (P = 0.006) and HBV-DNA level < 6.0 log copies/ml at the initiation of combination therapy (P = 0.007) were independent significant predictors of complete viral response. The cumulative rate of undetectable HBV-DNA was significantly higher in patients with response to the preceding LAM monotherapy than in those with poor response to it. Breakthrough hepatitis occurred in three patients without complete viral response and with poor response to the preceding LAM monotherapy, and rtA181A/V substitution was detected in one of the three patients. In conclusion, undetectable HBV-DNA during the LAM monotherapy was the strongest independent predictor of complete viral response to the following combination therapy. The efficacy of LAM plus ADV combination therapy may be determined by viral response to the preceding LAM monotherapy."

A total of 76 male Chinese patients who had been on highly active antiretroviral therapy for over one year were enrolled. All except one had undetectable viral load at the time of the assessment. Though a majority (76%) scored 100% in self-reporting adherence rating, one-third of these had in fact missed at least one dose in the preceding four-week period. Men having sex with men had a lower tendency of missing dose than heterosexuals (13.6% versus 42%, P=0.019). There was no association between missing doses and clinical staging or the regimens. The study revealed that missing doses may occur despite report of almost complete adherence, which, in the long run, could be a cause for concern."
14797,0.005,1.0000,"To determine the prevalence of erectile dysfunction and its associated factors we conducted an observational study on a consecutive cohort of asymptomatic HIV-positive men. All the patients completed a questionnaire to evaluate erectile dysfunction based on the International Index of Erectile Function, a validated survey for the diagnosis of anxiety and depression (self-administered HAD), and a questionnaire about cardiovascular risk factors. Epidemiological, clinical, and analytical data were collected. In all, 158 men, participated: mean age 46.0 years, 96.2% on antiretroviral therapy (91.3% undetectable viral load), and the mean CD4 count was 534 cells/mL. Erectile dysfunction was present in 106 (67.1%) patients, and associated factors were age (OR 4.5 for each 5 years; 95% CI 4.3-4.7; p=0.0001) and anxiety (OR 8.2, 95% CI 2.2-30.4; p=0.002). The prevalence of erectile dysfunction is high in men living with HIV, even in those with good immunovirological control. It is related to increasing age and anxiety, both of which are important factors within our HIV cohort."
235,0.005,1.0000,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is an AIDS-defining condition. Typically, KS affects the skin with or without visceral involvement. The extensive use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has decreased the incidence of KS amongst the HIV-positive population. We report a case of a 40-year-old man with HIV-1 infection with CD4 count of 551 cells/mm(3)and an undetectable viral load who presented with two skin-coloured KS lesions on the prepuce of the penis. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology. He had been commenced on ART three years earlier with a nadir CD4 count of 255 cells/mm(3) He had achieved and maintained viral suppression since commencing ART. The patient was initially treated with cryotherapy and 5% imiquimod as the lesions were presumed to be warts. The lack of response to treatment prompted further investigation. We carried out a literature search of published cases of penile KS over the past 10 years. The majority of articles regarding penile KS were published in the pre-ART era and involved patients with AIDS. Over the past 10 years, published cases of penile KS have almost exclusively been in HIV-negative men. We found 10 published cases of penile KS in HIV-negative men and only one other published case of penile KS in a HIV-positive man, who had severe immune suppression with CD4 count below 200 cells/mm(3) This is the first case report to describe a HIV-positive patient stable on ART with a CD4 count above 200 cells/mm(3)and suppressed HIV-1 viral load, to develop two KS lesions on the penis. Clinicians have to remain suspicious of penile lesions and appreciate the crucial role a biopsy with histopathological analysis plays in confirming a diagnosis. In addition, this case illustrates that unusual presentations of KS can still occur in treated HIV-positive patients with sustained immune recovery. "
9708,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy can reduce HIV-1 to undetectable levels in peripheral blood, but the effectiveness of treatment in suppressing replication in lymphoid tissue reservoirs has not been determined. Here we show in lymph node samples obtained before and during 6 mo of treatment that the tissue concentrations of five of the most frequently used antiretroviral drugs are much lower than in peripheral blood. These lower concentrations correlated with continued virus replication measured by the slower decay or increases in the follicular dendritic cell network pool of virions and with detection of viral RNA in productively infected cells. The evidence of persistent replication associated with apparently suboptimal drug concentrations argues for development and evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies that will fully suppress viral replication in lymphatic tissues. These strategies could avert the long-term clinical consequences of chronic immune activation driven directly or indirectly by low-level viral replication to thereby improve immune reconstitution. "
15610,0.005,1.0000,"This study aims to investigate health care providers' empathy levels and its association with avoidance in providing service to patients living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in China. A total of 1760 health service providers were randomly sampled from 40 county hospitals in two provinces of China. Using a self-administered questionnaire, participants' demographic characteristics, work history, empathy level, and avoidance attitudes toward PLWHA were collected in a cross-sectional survey. Empathy was higher among participants aged 31-40 years, those who had an associated medical degree, and those who had served in the medical profession for less than 20 years. Nurses, younger providers, and providers with lower education tended to avoid contact with PLWHA. Multiple linear regression model showed that a higher level of empathic attitude toward patients was significantly negatively associated with avoidance attitude toward PLWHA. Service providers' empathy level plays an important role in providing quality care to HIV-infected patients. Future stigma reduction interventions should cultivate empathy as a platform for understanding, effective communication, and trusting provider-patient relationships. PLWHA could potentially benefit from attitudinal change in medical settings."

Overall, 39 patients (9.4%) had anti-HEV IgG in January 2003, and included 35 patients (8.4%) who had already been positive for anti-HEV IgG at the start of hemodialysis and 4 patients (1%) who seroconverted after initiation of hemodialysis. Periodic serum samples that had been collected from the four seroconverted patients were tested for HEV antibodies and HEV RNA. The four patients became positive for anti-HEV IgG in 1979, 1980, 1988, or 2003, and continued to be seropositive until the end of the observation period. Although anti-HEV IgM was not detectable in the four patients, three were infected transiently with apparently Japanese indigenous HEV strains of genotype 3. The patient who contracted HEV infection in 1979 had been transfused with 2 U of blood 21 days before the transient viremia: one of the two stored pilot serum samples had detectable HEV RNA with 100% identity to that recovered from the patient. Our study provides evidence of transfusion-transmitted HEV infection in Japan in 1979, and that the prevalence of de novo HEV infection during hemodialysis was low (1.1% or 4/374)."

Of the 338 PCVs who served in Zaire between October 1985 and May 1988, 282 (83%) were enrolled, representing 7776 volunteer-months of service. Analyses of serum samples for HIV and hepatitis B virus were performed on enrollment and at completion of service. All PCVs received extensive education and counseling regarding HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome throughout their stay in Zaire. There were no documented seroconversions to HIV among 282 PCVs who lived in Zaire for periods ranging from 1 to 81 months, with a mean length of stay of 27.4 months. Of the 14 (6.2%) of 226 PCVs tested who had at least one positive serologic marker for infection with hepatitis B virus, none was documented to have seroconverted during service. During the study period, the rate of all sexually transmitted diseases among PCVs in Africa decreased from 131 to 68 per 1000 study population per year, and there were 52 cases of confirmed malaria among volunteers in Zaire. These data suggest that the risk of acquiring infection with HIV or hepatitis B virus in PCVs in Zaire is very low, and there is no evidence for unusual modes of transmission."

Our understanding of the situation in older adults, especially the middle-aged is, however, limited. We undertook to examine the latter's pattern of CD4/CD8 recovery following antiretroviral therapy.Retrospective clinical cohort data of HIV patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2014 in Hong Kong were collected. They were categorized by age at treatment initiation, viz., young adults (age 18-49), middle-aged (age 50-64), and elderly (≥65 years' old). Predictors of immune recovery (CD4 count, CD8 count, CD4/CD8 ratio) over time were examined using multivariable linear generalized estimating equations.A total of 2754 patients (aged ≥18) have been on antiretroviral therapy, with baseline characteristics similar between middle-aged and the elderly. Late diagnosis, defined as progression to AIDS within 3 months of HIV diagnosis, was less common in middle-aged (odds ratio = 0.58, 95% confidence interval = 0.37-0.91). Among Chinese patients who have been on treatment for ≥4 years (n = 913), 80.6%, 14.6%, and 4.8% were young adults, middle-aged, and elderly respectively. Late treatment initiation, defined as AIDS diagnosis or CD4 count ≤100 cells/μL before treatment, was common in middle-aged and elderly, the former however had faster CD4 recovery (3.95 vs. 3.36 cells/μL/month), but slower CD8 decline (-1.76 vs. -4.34 cells/μL/month) and CD4/CD8 normalization (0.009 vs. 0.0101/month).As a transitional age group, the immune recovery of middle-aged patients lagged behind young adults largely because of late treatment initiation. Following adoption of early and non-CD4-guided treatment initiation, their long-term clinical outcome is expected to improve."

Of 163 patients (16%) with a history of herpes zoster at enrollment, 22 (13%) had a recurrence during the 2-year follow-up. For those without prior herpes zoster, the probability of its development was 6.3% at 1 and 8.8% at 2 years. Progression to AIDS was not associated with herpes zoster. By proportional hazards analysis, an initial occurrence of herpes zoster was associated with prolonged survival independent of baseline CD4 cell count and disease stage; however, recurrence tended to be associated with death. Thus, herpes zoster is relatively common in advanced HIV infection and its initial occurrence late in disease may indicate improved prognosis."
342,0.005,1.0000,"Individuals who present late with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection do not benefit from advances in drug therapies that delay their progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This paper describes these individuals and their subsequent survival and investigates predictors of late presentation. All AIDS diagnoses from 1992-1998 notified to the Victorian State AIDS Registry were included. Subjects were grouped as individuals diagnosed with AIDS within 8 weeks of a first positive HIV test (late presenters), or individuals for whom there was more than 8 weeks between AIDS diagnosis and first positive HIV test (non-late presenters). Of 1021 AIDS diagnoses notified, 24% were late presenters. Late presentation was associated with increasing age, being bisexual or heterosexual, being born in Asia, southern Europe or South America and being diagnosed at a hospital. Late presenters survived longer following AIDS diagnosis (P < 0.0001). This increased survival may indicate a positive response by drug naïve patients to antiretroviral therapies following AIDS diagnosis."

Because simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in macaques is a common model system for HIV-1 pathogenesis, we determined whether SIV infection in macaques that develop simian AIDS is associated with a similar shift in viral tropism, replication, and cytopathic properties. The virus that infected the monkeys (SIVMneCL8) and predominated at early times in infection is a macrophage-tropic virus that replicates with relatively low efficiency in human T cell lines. The variant populations that arise in macaques as they progress to AIDS are more infectious for human T cell lines, exhibiting enhanced replication in CEM x 174 cells and an expanded host range that includes Molt-4 Clone 8 cells. Infections starting with equal doses of the viruses demonstrated that the late variants are cytopathic and syncytia-inducing compared to SIVMneCL8, but the variants replicate less efficiently in primary macaque macrophages. V3 sequences were generally conserved between the early and the late variants, suggesting that changes in SIVMne tropism, replication, and cytopathicity were apparently not due to alterations in V3. This study demonstrates important similarities in the phenotypic viral changes that accompany development of AIDS in SIV and HIV-1 infections and suggest that SIV may provide a model system for determining whether the rapidly replicating, T-cell-tropic cytopathic variants present late in infection and disease are indeed important in determining progression to AIDS."
8275,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) interacts with the immune system throughout the course of infection. For most of the disease process, HIV activates the immune system, and the degree of activation can be assessed by measuring serum levels of molecules such as beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin, as well as other serum and cell surface phenotype markers. The levels of some of these markers correlate with clinical progression of HIV disease, and these markers may be useful as surrogate markers for development of clinical AIDS. Because the likelihood and timing of development of clinical AIDS following seroconversion, for any particular individual, are not readily predictable, the use of nonclinical disease markers has become critically important to patient management. Surrogate markers of HIV infection are, by definition, measurable traits that correlate with disease progression. An ideal marker should identify patients at highest risk of disease progression, provide information on how long an individual has been infected, help in staging HIV disease, predict development of opportunistic infections associated with AIDS, monitor the therapeutic efficacy of immunomodulating or antiviral treatments, and the easily quantifiable, reliable, clinically available, and affordable. This review examines the current state of knowledge and the role of surrogate markers in the natural history and treatment of HIV infection. The clinical usefulness of each marker is assessed with respect to the criteria outlined for the ideal surrogate marker for HIV disease progression."
9037,0.005,1.0000,"OSTEOPOROSIS AND OSTEOPENIA: The use of multiple antiretroviral therapies has transformed the prognosis of HIV infection. However, the potential disadvantages of these treatments have rapidly appeared: lipodystrophy, cardiovascular complications and, more recently bone affections with osteonecrosis, followed by other weakening osteopathies (osteoporosis and osteopenia). Osteoporosis is a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) leading to a high risk of fracture. It is measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and is defined by a T-score<-2.5 standard deviations from the mean value of a young adult. Osteopenia corresponds to low bone density with, avec -1>T-score>-2.5. REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF RETROVIRAL AGENTS: During HIV infections, an osteopathy (most often osteopenia) is observed in a quarter to more than half of patients who have never received antiretroviral agents, and in up to three quarters in those in whom treatment in ongoing. The transversal nature of the majority of the studies, the heterogeneity of the treatments, the inclusion of both male and female patients in some studies, and the differences in the results observed do not permit one to draw any conclusions as to the possible responsibility of antiretroviral agents. An association between an osteopathy and a lipodystrophy is inconstant. Lastly, the substitution of a class of a antiretroviral agents by another does not lead to any significant modification in BMD. THE MECHANISM OF OCCURRENCE OF AN OSTEOPATHY: Has not been clearly established. The modifications in serum concentrations of biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption observed in HIV-infected patients and their evolution under antiretroviral treatment, suggest a viral origin, mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. The rare in vitro studies, or on animal models, are contradictory, with the results of clinical trials regarding the inherent role of antiretroviral drugs. However, it is probable that the classical risk factors for osteoporosis are often implied."

10484,0.005,1.0000,"Osteopenia and osteoporosis are common in HIV-1-infected individuals and represent a challenge in clinical and therapeutic management. This report investigated osteopenia/osteoporosis in a group of 31 antiretroviral naive HIV-1-positive men and the role of specific molecules belonging to TNF and the TNF-receptor family in HIV-1-related bone mass loss. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), the receptor activator of NF-kappab-ligand (RANKL), and the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) were significantly increased in the plasma of antiretroviral naive HIV-1-positive patients compared to a control group of healthy blood donors. In addition, TRAIL and RANKL plasma concentrations were positively correlated to HIV-1-RNA viral load. Measurement of bone mineral density in 20 out of 31 HIV-1-positive subjects disclosed osteopenia/osteoporosis in 40% of these patients. The antiretroviral naive HIV-1-positive subjects with low bone mineral density had a decreased plasma OPG/RANKL ratio and a plasma RANKL concentration >500 pg/ml. Together, these data indicate that plasma concentrations of specific factors involved in bone homeostasis were increased during HIV-1 infection and that RANKL and OPG/RANKL ratio deregulation may be involved in osteopenia/osteoporosis occurring in antiretroviral naive HIV-1 individuals."

All participants provided information on bone health and underwent DEXA scanning. Osteopenia was found in 58% of subjects and osteoporosis in 12%; 14% reported fractures since HIV diagnosis. Number of fractures since HIV diagnosis was significantly increased among those with osteoporosis (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.2-10.4, p = 0.018). Duration of infection greater than 13 years was significantly associated with osteoporosis. Duration of cART was associated in univariate but not multivariate analyses. Strategies to prevent osteoporosis and fractures in HIV will require attention to viral and lifestyle factors and not just cART. "
9663,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has revolutionized care of patients with HIV infection. The cost of increased survival has been antiretroviral toxicity and increasing age-related co-morbidities that include significant metabolic issues. Hypogonadism was first described in the setting of advanced AIDS and can be primary or secondary. Data regarding treatment largely concern patients with wasting. Varied syndromes involving bone have been described in patients with HIV including osteonecrosis, low bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis, and rarely osteomalacia. Low BMD leading to osteoporosis is the most common bone pathology and may be as a result of HIV infection, drug toxicity or co-morbidities. However, increasingly fragility fractures are reported in HIV-infected patients, suggesting bone demineralization in this population is of clinical relevance. Further research is required to understand its pathogenesis and determine effective management; however, initiation of antiretroviral therapy seems to accelerate (in the short-term) bone demineralization. One particular antiretroviral agent, tenofovir is widely used and is potentially implicated as having a greater role in long-term bone and renal dysfunction. As this population ages, screening for low BMD will become increasingly more important."
17682,0.005,1.0000,"Risk factors for hypoandrogenemia among low-weight, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are not known. Testosterone levels of 69 HIV-infected women with low weight and weight loss were compared with levels for 25 healthy, age- and body mass index-matched control subjects. HIV-infected subjects were of low weight, with a mean (+/- standard deviation) weight loss of -17.6% +/- 9.7% from preillness maximum, and 42% of HIV-infected subjects had a body mass index of <20 kg/m(2). Forty-nine percent of the HIV-infected population versus 8% of the control population exhibited low free testosterone levels (P<.001). Among HIV-infected women, when we controlled for chronic hepatitis status, age, and time of blood sampling, weight loss of >10% of maximum weight was a significant predictor of low free testosterone levels. Free testosterone levels did not differ by drug class or antiretroviral regimen. In conclusion, decreased androgen levels are common among HIV-infected women reporting significant weight loss, independent of exposure to antiretroviral medications."
1243,0.005,1.0000,"Gynecomastia has been reported to occur in HIV-infected patients receiving HAART. A retrospective case-control study was conducted to determine risk factors associated with this condition. Two control patients were randomly chosen for each of 23 case patients identified. An efavirenz-containing regimen was strongly associated with the development of gynecomastia (odds ratio, 20; P < .001). Case patients were not more likely to have lipodystrophy, low testosterone levels, chronic infection with hepatitis B or C virus, or liver dysfunction compared with control patients. None of these factors altered the efavirenz-associated risk when analyzed by multiple logistic regression. Efavirenz appears to be strongly associated with gynecomastia in HIV-infected patients receiving HAART."

Its general aim is to contribute in the design of programmes to help people with HIV/AIDS (PWH/A) adopt and maintain safe sexual behaviours. A self-administered questionnaire on sexual and drug use behaviours was distributed to study participants. Between 1997 and 1999, 573 women with HIV infection naive to antiretroviral therapies completed the questionnaire (of whom 234 reported a history of injection drug use (IDU) and were enrolled in the study. Non-IDU women reported fewer sexual partners, both in their lifetime and in the preceding month, than IDU women: 19% of IDU and 4% of non-IDU women reported more than 25 lifetime sexual partners (p < 0.001). Interestingly, 83% of non-IDU women were infected by their regular partners: these women reported the lowest number of sexual partners. No difference emerged between IDU and non-IDU women in terms of number of sexual intercourse in the two weeks preceding the interview or in terms of condom use in the last intercourse (reported, overall, by 54% of these 573 women). Among women who had sex partners at the time of interview, more non-IDU (65%) than IDU (43%) women reported HIV-positive partners (p < 0.001). Overall, these findings stress a marked heterogeneity in the levels of past and recent sexual promiscuity according to history of drug use. It suggests the need to differentiate and individualize messages about self-protection and behaviours that may prevent further spread of HIV infection."
18136,0.005,1.0000,"Ill-health contributes to impoverishment, a process brought into sharper focus by the impact of the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic. This paper reviews studies that have measured the economic costs and consequences of illness for households, focusing on malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and HIV/AIDS. It finds that in resource-poor settings illness imposed high and regressive cost burdens on patients and their families. Direct and indirect costs of illness for malaria were less than 10% of the household income, but still significant when combined with the costs of other illnesses. The costs of TB and HIV/AIDS were catastrophic for households (more than 10% of the income). Health service weaknesses in many countries, including low coverage, user charges, and poor quality of care, contributed to high costs. Poor households in developing countries with a member with TB or HIV/AIDS struggled to cope, highlighting the urgent need for a substantial increase in health sector investment to expand access to preventive and curative health services. Government and non-governmental interventions should also be broadened to encompass measures that reduce the substantial indirect costs associated with diseases such as malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS."
271,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a challenging public-health issue in China. Hepatitis B carriers and patients suffer not only physically but also experience strong discrimination and stigma. China's rural population is 629 million. Thus, there is a great need to understand the situation surrounding HBV-related discrimination in everyday life in rural China. We studied 6,538 participants (≥18 y old) from 42 villages across 7 provinces (districts). Many studies have addressed discrimination against those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, few studies have addressed HBV-related discrimination. We found that the fear of HBV infection, not lack of knowledge about it, predominantly leads to HBV-related discrimination (although limited knowledge is also a cause). Notably, receiving the HBV vaccination contributes to reduced discrimination. In addition, the existence of fewer misunderstandings about false HBV transmission routes plays a more important role in discrimination than does understanding of true HBV transmission routes. Therefore, to reduce HBV-related discrimination, policy makers should consider eliminating HBV-related fear, strengthening adult HBV immunization programs, developing large-scale education dissemination about HBV transmission routes and non-transmission routes, and paying greater attention to target populations.

4080,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). In a significant number of patients, ART is associated with fat redistribution and metabolic alterations such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes, summarized under the term HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HIV-LS). The pathogenesis of HIV-LS is complex and involves a number of factors including ART, HIV-1, abnormal fat redistribution, metabolic abnormalities and chronic inflammation. In view of a novel understanding on how chronic inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection, this review focuses on the interaction of the immune system and metabolic pathways and the potential consequences for the HIV-LS. Based on the current literature, we suggest a central role of systemic inflammation in triggering and deteriorating various components of the HIV-LS."

Replication of isolated virus varied from barely detectable to similar to that of the wild-type virus, and virus isolated from five SBBC members showed coreceptor usage signatures unique to each individual. Higher viral loads and stronger neutralizing antibody responses were associated with better-replicating viral strains, and detectable viral replication was essential for the development of strong and sustained humoral immune responses. Despite the presence of strong neutralizing antibodies in a number of SBBC members, disease progression was not prevented, and each cohort member studied displayed a unique outcome of infection with nef-attenuated HIV-1."

The study group consisted of 230 HIV-positive health plan members who received care at the Kaiser Permanente Santa Rosa medical center (KPMC-SRO). In 1994, the comparison group consisted of 4747 HIV-positive health plan members who received care at Kaiser Permanente's 18 other medical centers in northern California. The percentages of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-positive patients as determined by CD4+ T-cell counts were similar (P = 0.97). Compared with patients at the other Kaiser Permanente medical centers, KPMC-SRO patients had more visits with nurse practitioners (rate ratio [RR] = 1.72) and nutritionists (RR = 12.3) and fewer visits with primary care physicians (RR = 0.82). More HIV-positive members at KPMC-SRO received social workers' services (27% at KPMC-SRO vs 6% for patients at the other Kaiser Permanente medical centers) and fewer used emergency services (RR = 0.92) and psychiatric services (RR = .89). At KPMC-SRO, the mean number of days that AIDS patients spent in the hospital decreased from 7.8 (1991) to 2.01 (1994). Hospital admissions were fewer (AIDS patients, RR = 0.67; HIV-positive patients without AIDS, RR = 0.45), and length of stay was briefer, compared with patients at the other Kaiser Permanente Medical Centers. The mean cost of HIV-related drugs for patients seen at KPMC-SRO ($2343 per infected member) was lower than that for patients seen elsewhere in the region ($3289 per infected member).

5623,0.005,1.0000,"Genetic recombination contributes to the diversity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Productive HIV-1 recombination is, however, dependent on both the number of HIV-1 genomes per infected cell and the genetic relationship between these viral genomes. A detailed analysis of the number of proviruses and their genetic relationship in infected cells isolated from peripheral blood and tissue compartments is therefore important for understanding HIV-1 recombination, genetic diversity and the dynamics of HIV-1 infection. To address these issues, we used a previously developed single-cell sequencing technique to quantify and genetically characterize individual HIV-1 DNA molecules from single cells in lymph node tissue and peripheral blood. Analysis of memory and naïve CD4(+) T cells from paired lymph node and peripheral blood samples from five untreated chronically infected patients revealed that the majority of these HIV-1-infected cells (>90%) contain only one copy of HIV-1 DNA, implying a limited potential for productive recombination in virus produced by these cells in these two compartments. Phylogenetic analysis revealed genetic similarity of HIV-1 DNA in memory and naïve CD4(+) T-cells from lymph node, peripheral blood and HIV-1 RNA from plasma, implying exchange of virus and/or infected cells between these compartments in untreated chronic infection.

The sample was comprised of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who resided in a predominantly rural area with low HIV prevalence. The majority of participants relied on a combination of sources including their HIV/AIDS physician, the Internet, a Ryan-White caseworker and a staff member of a community-based support organization to meet their informational needs. Information sought focused primarily on drug regimens, drug side effects, or drug research. Participants shared barriers to accessing information including stigma, fear, concern about disclosure, and feelings of futility and anger.

A total of 169 blood samples were collected. The sera were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine the presence of antibodies anti-HTLV-1/2. Confirmation of infection and discrimination of HTLV types and subtypes was performed using a nested polymerase chain reaction targeting the pX and 5' LTR regions, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing analysis. The presence of anti-HTLV1/2 was detected in six patients from Belém. The amplification of the pX region followed by RFLP analysis, demonstrated the presence of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infections among two and four patients, respectively. Sequencing HTLV-1 5' LTR indicated that the virus is a member of the Cosmopolitan Group, Transcontinental subgroup. HTLV-2 strains isolated revealed a molecular profile of subtype HTLV-2c.

For these reasons, in the present prospective study on 45 HIV-infected patients, a structured psychiatric interview (SIDAM) was conducted based on the algorithm of diagnosing dementia in DSM-III-R and the ICD-10 guidelines. The psychopathological findings are expressed in syndrome scores; the results are summarized in a total score (SISCO). The interview contains the Mini-Mental State Examination. The degree of psychosocial functioning was estimated on the global assessment of functioning, Axis V of DSM-III-R. In stages preceding AIDS, only slight cognitive dysfunction was found compared with age- and education-matched normal controls, and this caused no relevant disturbance of psychosocial functioning. In 9 patients with manifest AIDS, dementia was diagnosed with DSM-III-R criteria and ICD-10 guidelines (30% of the AIDS patients).

Women (37%) were also significantly less likely than men (59%) to report that they believe new treatments have brought hope and better prospects for PLWHA. Thirteen women and 63 men who completed the survey also participated in an in-depth interview which further explored the use of, and attitudes to, antiretroviral drugs for HIV/AIDS and their impact on personal relationships and work-related issues. Taken together, the survey and interview data suggest that male PLWHA have positive albeit qualified views about antiretrovirals and believe their health and future prospects have been improved by advances in treatments. In contrast, female PLWHA were sceptical about treatments and were unwilling to link their future prospects to the outcomes of antiretroviral therapy. Multivariate analysis of the correlates of attitudes to treatments revealed gender to be a significant independent predictor of more positive attitudes.

Subjects consented to a voluntary, anonymous, and confidential interview containing information on demographic characteristics, medical history, drug use, and sexual behavior. Of 26 cases interviewed, 20 (76.9%) reported behaviors defined by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as risk factors for HIV infection, while 11 of 74 (14.9%) controls also reported such behaviors. This proportion of reclassified NIR cases was similar to that reported from the NIR case series study conducted by the CDC. Of the six (23.1%) cases who remained at NIR, all reported at least one of the following risks: a history of sexually transmitted diseases, sexual contact with prostitutes, or sexual activity with female partners which caused bleeding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
17630,0.005,1.0000,"This study provides an understanding of the experiences and perceptions of phlebotomy in people with infection who have venous damage related to injecting drug use with the aim of improving their care. Narrative interviews were conducted with 10 attendees of a phlebotomy service within an acute Trust in the south-west of England. The participants had hepatitis C infection and poor venous access due to current or former drug use. Interview audiotapes were analyzed, and the themes - conflict, emotional responses, the patient as expert, and offering solutions - were identified. In the context of this study, we discuss the difficulties associated with phlebotomy, which might explain why individuals with hepatitis C infection and venous damage disengage from health services and are less likely to undertake antiviral treatment. This research adds to the literature on phlebotomy for vulnerable groups, and recommends hepatitis C virus clinics within drug agencies, the need to review training and policy, and the development of ""phlebotomy passports"" to enable continuity of care between services.

16192,0.005,1.0000,"Brazil provides free antiretroviral (ARV) therapy to some 150,000 individuals living with HIV/ AIDS). ARV regimens require optimal adherence to achieve undetectable viral loads and to avoid viral resistance. Physicians play a key role to foster ARV adherence, but until now little is known about the communication between physicians/ people living with HIV/AIDS in this setting. In-depth interviews were conducted with 40 physicians treating people living with HIV/AIDS at six public reference centers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Interview topics included: experiences in the treatment of people living with HIV/AIDS, relationship and dialogue with patients, barriers/facilitators to adherence, and effectiveness of available services. Barriers to ARV adherence were mainly related to the low quality of patient-provider relationship. Other barriers were related to ""chaotic"" patients' lifestyles, and inadequate knowledge and/or negative beliefs about HIV/AIDS and ARV effectiveness. It is necessary to improve networking between services, establish agile referral systems, and improve health professionals' integration. These structural changes could contribute to improved adherence, resulting in improved quality of life for people living with HIV/AIDS."

A total of 26 of 84 genes of the apoptosis pathway were differentially expressed. Two of the upregulated genes, DFFA and TNFRSF1A, classified 75% of study participants correctly as either a case or control. Thus, apoptosis may be in the causal pathway of ART-associated mitochondrial toxicity. These two genes could be markers for detecting and monitoring ART-induced mitochondrial toxicity."

2216,0.005,1.0000,"This is a systematic review of eighty-two published studies investigating the impact of DSM-IV mental disorders on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) adherence and persistence among persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Sixty-two articles examined depression, with 58 % (N = 32/62) finding lower cART adherence and persistence. Seventeen articles examined one or more anxiety disorders, with the majority finding no association with cART adherence or persistence. Eighty percent of the studies that evaluated the impact of psychotic (N = 3), bipolar (N = 5) and personality disorders (N = 2) on cART adherence and persistence also found no association. Seven out of the nine studies (78 %) evaluating the impact of antidepressant treatment (ADT) on cART adherence found improvement. Adherence and depression measurements varied significantly in studies; common research measurements would improve data harmonization. More research specifically addressing the impact of other mental disorders besides depression on cART adherence and RCTs evaluating ADT on cART adherence are also needed."

One hundred and seventeen patients were selected for this study; their plasma viral RNA was extracted and the PR and RT genes sequenced to examine subtype, genetic polymorphisms and mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs. HIV-1 sequence analysis showed that 86/100 (86%) were infected with subtype B, 7/100 (7%) with subtype F and 7/100 (7%) with RT/PR hybrid forms (2 D/B, 2 F/B, 2 B/F and 1 D/F). In 14 (12%) of the samples, the subtype was not determined. The prevalence of resistance mutations was high (93.1%), mainly in the RT gene. The most prevalent resistance mutations were: M184V (60.7%), T215Y (49.6%) and M41L (46.7%) in the RT gene and L90M (19.6%), M46I (16.2%) and D30N (12.8%) in the PR gene. The frequency of resistance mutations tended to increase from the first to the second therapeutic scheme failure (p=0.079); but it stabilized after subsequent failures (p=0.875). Our finding of a high frequency of drug resistant HIV-1 samples supports the need for continuous genotypic monitoring of patients failing HAART."
16899,0.005,1.0000,"Seventeen AIDS patients were enrolled in a prospective open-label dose-finding study of octreotide (Sandostatin) therapy for refractory diarrhea. Five were nonevaluable due to progression of AIDS symptomatology, and one was excluded because of lack of confirmation of HIV infection. Five of 11 evaluable patients responded to therapy (45%); two each at 50 micrograms and 100 micrograms, and one at 250 micrograms thrice daily doses. A sixth patient demonstrated a moderate reduction in stool volume at 250 micrograms thrice daily, which, although deemed clinically relevant, did not meet the criteria for response. On discontinuation of therapy, diarrhea recurred in all patients within 1-12 days, and responded to reinitiation of octreotide in those five patients who resumed treatment. Only one of the three patients with concurrent cryptosporidial infection responded to treatment. The drug was well tolerated, with mild symptomatology in three patients. Long-term treatment at a stable dose was effective in three of five treated patients for periods for seven months in one (moderate responder) and one year in two. One patient required dose increases to control symptoms, but after one year of treatment developed severe nausea following injections, which required dose cessation. One patient had partial control of his diarrhea for only three months despite two dose increases. These data suggest that octreotide may be of useful therapeutic value in HIV-associated diarrhea and that further studies are indicated."
5553,0.005,1.0000,"We have analyzed the V beta usage by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals in response to an in vitro stimulation with the superantigenic erythrogenic toxin A (ETA) of Streptococcus pyogenes. ETA amplifies specifically CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from control donors expressing the V beta 8 and the V beta 12 elements. When peripheral T cells from asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals were stimulated with ETA, there was a complete lack of activation of the V beta 8+ T cell subset, whereas the V beta 12+ T cell subset responded normally to the superantigen. This V beta-specific anergy, which was also observed in response to staphylococcal enterotoxin E (SEE), affected both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and represented an intrinsic functional defect rather than a specific lack of response to bacterial superantigens since it was also observed after a stimulation with V beta 8 monoclonal antibodies. The V beta 8 anergic T cells did not express interleukin 2 receptors (IL-2Rs) and failed to proliferate in response to exogenous IL-2 or IL-4, suggesting that this anergy was not a reversible process, at least by the use of these cytokines. The unresponsiveness of the V beta 8 T cell subset is frequent since it was found in 56% of the patients studied, and comparison of the clinical status of responder vs. anergic patients indicated that the only known common factor between them was HIV infection. In addition, it is noteworthy that the anergy of the V beta 8 subset may be a very early phenomenon since it was found in a patient at Centers for Disease Control stage I of the disease. These data provide evidence that a dominant superantigen may be involved in the course of HIV infection and that the contribution of HIV has to be considered."
5521,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) replicates more efficiently in T-cell lines expressing T-cell receptors derived from certain V beta genes, V beta 12 in particular, suggesting the effects of a superantigen. The targeted V beta 12 subset was not deleted in HIV-1-infected patients. It was therefore possible that it might represent an in vivo viral reservoir. Viral load was assessed by quantitative PCR with gag primers and with an infectivity assay to measure competent virus. It was shown that the tiny V beta 12 subset (1-2% of T cells) often has a higher viral load than other V beta subsets in infected patients. Selective HIV-1 replication in V beta 12 cells was also observed 6-8 days after in vitro infection of peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal, HIV-1 negative donors. Viral replication in targeted V beta subsets may serve to promote a biologically relevant viral reservoir."
18179,0.005,1.0000,"The search to identify HIV-associated molecules with superantigenic properties has focussed on demonstration of T cell receptor V beta subset-specific perturbations in HIV-infected patients. In this report, the V beta repertoire of two HIV patients was studied in lymph nodes, where HIV-1 replication is the most intense, and compared to the repertoire found in peripheral blood. Use of this fully MHC-compatible system has allowed identification of a small, partly overlapping set of V beta determinants which appear significantly perturbed in HIV-1 infection. These results are consistent with the presence of an HIV-associated superantigen."
10818,0.005,1.0000,"In HIV-1-infected individuals the CD8+ T cell subset is considerably expanded. This has been shown to be caused predominantly by an increase in the number of CD8+CD28- T cells. To characterize further the subsets of CD8+ T cells, we have performed analyses of cell surface phenotype, T cell receptor Vbeta usage, and ability to survive in unstimulated cultures. CD8+CD28- T cells frequently expressed CD45RA. Nonetheless, coincident expression of CD95 (Fas) and high levels of integrins suggested that these cells were immunologically experienced. Contrary to what has been observed in CD8+CD28- T cells from uninfected individuals, a common hierarchy of Vbeta usage was found in CD8+CD28- T cells from HIV-1-infected individuals, which was adhered to by all the study participants, and which was shown to be similar to that observed within CD8+CD28+ T cells. Cells from the memory subsets of CD8+ T cells showed a high incidence of spontaneous death in unstimulated cultures, indicating that these cells have received signals for death by apoptosis in vivo. In contrast, most naive CD8+CD28+CD45RA+ cells survived. The CD8+CD28- memory subset is expanded in vivo despite evidence for coincident excessive cell death in vitro. Our results are consistent with the notion that frequent transitions occur from the memory CD8+CD28+CD45RA- T cell subset to the end-stage CD8+CD28- subset during HIV-1 infection."
12827,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) replicates more efficiently in T cells expressing T-cell receptors using certain V beta genes, V beta 12 in particular. This V beta specificity was consistent with an HIV-1-associated superantigen. In addition, T cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-positive donors potently stimulated V beta 12 cell lines to proliferate in culture, but not control B beta 6.7a cell lines, thus indicating the presence of a V beta-selective mitogen. The targeted V beta subsets were not deleted. It was therefore possible that these subsets might represent a viral reservoir in vivo. Viral load was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (with HIV-1 gag primers) and with an infectivity assay to measure competent virus. It was shown that the tiny V beta 12 subset (1-2% of T cells) has a higher viral load than other V beta subsets in about 65% of infected individuals. Selective HIV-1 replication in V beta 12 cells was also observed 6-9 days after in vitro infection of peripheral blood T cells from several normal HIV-1-negative donors. In summary, a superantigen-like activity appears to promote V beta-selective HIV-1 replication in vitro and in vivo in patients infected with HIV-1. New therapeutic approaches are suggested based on these findings."
18653,0.005,1.0000,"The frequency of neurodegenerative markers among long surviving human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals is unknown, therefore, the present study investigated the frequency of alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid, and HIV-associated brain pathology in the brains of older HIV-infected individuals. We examined the substantia nigra of 73 clinically well-characterized HIV-infected individuals aged 50 to 76 years from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium. We also examined the frontal and temporal cortical regions of a subset of 36 individuals. Neuritic alpha-synuclein expression was found in 16% (12/73) of the substantia nigra of the HIV+cases and none of the older control cases (0/18). beta-Amyloid deposits were prevalent and found in nearly all of the HIV+cases (35/36). Despite these increases of degenerative pathology, HIV-associated brain pathology was present in only 10% of cases. Among older HIV+adults, HIV-associated brain pathology does not appear elevated; however, the frequency of both alpha-synuclein and beta-amyloid is higher than that found in older healthy persons. The increased prevalence of alpha-synuclein and beta-amyloid in the brains of older HIV-infected individuals may predict an increased risk of developing neurodegenerative disease."
1385,0.005,1.0000,"We have examined the relation of cell surface marker phenotype to the anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) function of CD8+ cells from individuals at various clinical stages of HIV infection. Multiparametric flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that the most significant changes in cell surface phenotype was found within the CD8+ cell subset expressing HLA-DR and CD28. These changes in the levels of CD28 and HLA-DR expression on CD8+ cells were found to be related to antiviral activity and have clinical relevance based on three pieces of evidence: (1) strong CD8+ cell antiviral responses were associated in infected individuals with high levels of HLA-DR+ and CD28+ subsets; (2) CD8+ cell anti-HIV activity in vitro resides predominantly in the separated CD8+ cell subsets that express HLA-DR or CD28; and (3) in longitudinal studies, CD8+ cell anti-HIV activity decreased as an individual progressed from a healthy state to an AIDS condition. Taken together, the data suggest that the CD8+ cell subset identified phenotypically as a CD8+ CD28+ HLA-DR+ cell is responsible for natural anti-HIV activity. Longitudinal studies should determine if alterations in this subset can be used as a prognostic indicator for disease progression."
5631,0.005,1.0000,"CD8(+) T lymphocytes play a pivotal role in controlling human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 replication in vivo. We have performed four-color flow cytometric analysis of CD8(+) peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 21 HIV-1 seronegative and 103 seropositive individuals to explore the phenotypic heterogeneity of CD8beta-chain expression on CD8(+) T lymphocytes and to clarify how its expression on CD8(+) T lymphocytes may relate to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) clinical progression. We showed that the single monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 2ST8-5H7, directed against the CD8alpha beta-heterodimer, identifies CD8(+) T lymphocytes as effectively as the conventional combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD8alpha antibodies. However, we detected a significantly lower mean fluorescence (MF) of anti-CD8alpha beta staining on PBL from HIV-1 seropositive donors as compared with seronegative donors. In fact, CD8(+) T lymphocytes from HIV-1-infected individuals with the lowest CD4 counts showed the lowest levels of CD8alpha beta MF. To explore further this change in CD8alpha beta expression, we assessed the expression of 14 different cell surface molecules on CD8alpha beta+ T lymphocytes of PBL from 11 HIV-1 seronegative and 22 HIV-1 seropositive individuals. The MF of anti-CD8alpha beta staining was significantly reduced on CD8(+) T lymphocyte subsets that showed immunophenotypic evidence of activation. The subset of lymphocytes expressing low levels of CD8alpha beta expressed higher levels of activation, adhesion, and cytotoxic-associated molecules and was predominantly CD45RO+ and CD28(-). Finally, we monitored the expression of the CD8alpha beta-heterodimer on PBL of eight HIV-1-infected individuals over a 16-week period after the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), including zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), and indinavir (IDV), and found a significant increase in the expression of the CD8alpha beta-heterodimer. These results suggest that antibodies recognizing the CD8alpha beta-heterodimer are useful tools to specifically identify CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Moreover, the quantitative monitoring of CD8alpha beta expression allows the detection of discrete CD8(+) T lymphocyte subsets and may be useful for assessing the immune status of individuals infected with HIV-1."
2379,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection causes apoptosis of infected CD4 T cells as well as uninfected (bystander) CD4 and CD8 T cells. It remains unknown what signals cause infected cells to die. We demonstrate that HIV-1 protease specifically cleaves procaspase 8 to create a novel fragment termed casp8p41, which independently induces apoptosis. casp8p41 is specific to HIV-1 protease-induced death but not other caspase 8-dependent death stimuli. In HIV-1-infected patients, casp8p41 is detected only in CD4(+) T cells, predominantly in the CD27(+) memory subset, its presence increases with increasing viral load, and it colocalizes with both infected and apoptotic cells. These data indicate that casp8p41 independently induces apoptosis and is a specific product of HIV-1 protease which may contribute to death of HIV-1-infected cells."
33,0.005,1.0000,"With advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART), individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are living longer and increasingly die of non-HIV-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). Several observational studies suggest that HIV-infected patients on ART are at increased risk of CVD; however, the precise mechanisms underlying the association between HIV infection and CVD risk are uncertain. Atherosclerosis and arterial disease in HIV-infected individuals is a multifactorial process with several potential targets for research and therapeutic intervention. This paper critically reviews the contributions of imaging to our understanding of arterial disease, atherosclerosis, and CVD risk in HIV-infected individuals. In general, the findings of studies using carotid ultrasound, coronary computed tomographic angiography, and aortic positron emission tomography agree with those from observational studies of CVD events and suggest that HIV infection is associated with an increased risk of CVD. Observational studies of CVD outcomes and studies using carotid intima-media thickness suggest that there is a moderate increase in CVD risk related to HIV serostatus. Less can be said about the role of ART and specific ART therapies in CVD risk, mainly because imaging studies have had serious methodological limitations that diminish their generalizability. Brachial artery reactivity testing has been especially useful for elucidating the arterial pathophysiology of HIV infection and its treatments, as well as the arterial effects of interventions for treating HIV and dyslipidemia. Aortic positron emission tomography has been especially useful for evaluating arterial inflammation. Coronary artery calcium has not proven to be a useful marker of subclinical atherosclerosis in HIV-infected individuals. Imaging studies support the intriguing hypothesis that persistent inflammation and immune dysregulation contribute to increased CVD risk among treated and suppressed patients with HIV infection. "

15154,0.005,1.0000,"With widespread availability and the use of antiretroviral therapy, patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States are living long enough to experience non-AIDS-defining illnesses. HIV is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) because of traditional CVD risk factors, residual virally mediated inflammation despite HIV treatment, and side effects of antiretroviral therapy. No United States population-wide studies have evaluated patterns of CVD mortality for HIV-infected subjects. Our central hypothesis was that the proportionate mortality from CVD (CVD mortality/total mortality) in the HIV-infected population increased from 1999 to 2013. We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research online database of the United States public health data to assess proportionate CVD mortality from 1999 to 2013 in the HIV-infected, general, and inflammatory polyarthropathy populations; the inflammatory polyarthropathy population was included as a positive control group. Total mortality in the HIV-infected population decreased from 15,739 in 1999 to 8,660 in 2013; however, CVD mortality increased from 307 to 400 during the same period. Thus, proportionate CVD mortality for the HIV-infected population increased significantly from 1999 to 2013 (p <0.0001); this pattern was consistent across races, particularly for men. In contrast, proportionate CVD mortality decreased for the general and inflammatory polyarthropathy populations from 1999 to 2013. In conclusion, CVD has become an increasingly common cause of death in HIV-infected subjects since 1999; understanding evolving mortality risks in the HIV-infected population is essential to inform routine clinical care of HIV-infected subjects as well as CVD prevention and treatment.

7074,0.005,1.0000,"From a global perspective, cardiovascular disease (CVD) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may result from cardiac involvement upon presentation of opportunistic infections in the presence of advanced immunosuppression, be a consequence of HIV-induced immune activation or derive from antiretroviral therapy-associated dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance. Indeed, in developed countries with unlimited access to antiretroviral therapy CVD has become one of the major causes of death in HIV. Therefore, cardiovascular risk reduction and lifestyle modifications are essential and careful selection of the antiretroviral drugs according to underlying cardiovascular risk factors of great importance. In developing countries with delayed roll-out of antiretroviral therapy pericardial disease (often related to TB), HIV-associated cardiomyopathy, and HIV-associated pulmonary hypertension are the most common cardiac manifestations in HIV. In Africa, the epicentre of the HIV epidemic, dynamic socio-economic and lifestyle factors characteristic of epidemiological transition appear to have positioned the urban African community at the cross-roads between historically prevalent and 'new' forms of CVD, such as coronary artery disease. In this context, cardiovascular risk assessment of HIV-infected patients will become a critical element of care in developing countries similar to the developed world, and access to antiretroviral therapy with little or no impact on lipid and glucose metabolism of importance to reduce CVD in HIV.

17529,0.005,1.0000,"Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection might be at risk for ischemic cardiovascular disease (CVD). We reviewed the records of 16 HIV-infected persons with proven CVD (8 cases of angina and 8 cases of myocardial infarctions). This represents 1.7% of HIV-infected persons seen at our institution from 1 April 1999 through 25 April 2000. In comparison with 32 HIV-infected age- and sex-matched controls, case patients had more risk factors for CVD (median number of risk factors for CVD, 3 versus 1; P<.001), lower nadir CD4+ lymphocyte counts (median, 101 cells/mm3 versus 278 cells/mm3; P=.02), and a longer duration of prior exposure to nucleoside analogs (median, 190 weeks versus 130 weeks; P=.02). There was no difference in the duration of exposure to protease inhibitors. Ischemic CVD occurs in HIV-infected persons and appears to be most closely associated with traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease (for example, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia). Lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts and duration of HIV infection might also be risk factors or markers for the development of ischemic CVD."

12556,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and incidence of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection among young (aged 29 years or younger) injection drug users (IDUs) and to compare sociodemographic and risk characteristics between (HIV/HCV) coinfected, monoinfected, or HIV- and HCV-negative youth. Data were collected through the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS). To date, more than 1400 IDUs have been enrolled and followed, of whom 479 were aged 29 years or younger. Semiannually, participants have completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire and have undergone serologic testing for HIV and HCV. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were undertaken to investigate predictors of baseline coinfection. Cox regression models with time-dependent covariates were used to identify predictors of time to secondary infection seroconversion. A Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to determine risk associations across 3 categories: no infection, monoinfection, and coinfection. Of the 479 young injectors, 78 (16%) were coinfected with HIV and HCV at baseline and a further 45 (15%) with follow-up data became coinfected during the study period. Baseline coinfection was independently associated with being female, being aboriginal, older age, greater number of years injecting, and living in the IDU epicenter. Factors independently associated with time to secondary infection seroconversion were borrowing needles and greater than once-daily cocaine injection, and accessing methadone maintenance therapy in the previous 6 months was protective. There were clear trends across the 3 categories for increasing proportions of female subjects, aboriginal subjects, older age, greater number of years injecting, living in the IDU epicenter, and daily cocaine use. There were a shocking number of youth living with coinfection, particularly female and aboriginal youth. The median number of years injecting for youth seroconverting to a secondary infection was 3 years, suggesting that appropriate public health interventions should be implemented immediately."
2783,0.005,1.0000,"Since the cloning of hepatitis C virus (HCV), a number of serologic and virologic tests for detecting infections with this virus have been made available for clinical practice. This led to the recognition of HCV as a major health hazard in hemodialysis (HD) centers. Yet the nephrology community has not been offered explicit recommendations about routine serologic testing for HCV of dialysis patients and consequently has remained unclear and divided about the utility of this testing. This review presents evidence in support of instituting routine serologic testing for HCV among dialysis patients. It concludes that because of the peculiar features of HCV infection in HD patients, serologic testing for HCV is the only means for unequivocal diagnosis of hepatitis C and an irreplaceable instrument for monitoring the incidence and the prevalence of the infection in this population. Serologic surveillance for HCV infection is crucial for identifying the association of new cases of HCV infection with potential risk factors for HCV transmission, particularly nosocomial, that can be modified in a way to prevent further dissemination of the virus. Data collected from routine serologic testing for HCV will undoubtedly improve our understanding of the epidemiology of HCV in the dialysis population and will provide a strong foundation for developing preventive measures and infection control strategies that are highly effective in controlling HCV infection. Routine serologic testing for HCV is also of direct benefit to the individual patient since establishing the HCV serologic status of each patient is important for optimizing patient care."

Seven dialysis units and 112 dialysis workers participated in the study over a period of 2 years. Participation was limited to dialysis workers who, by questionnaire, denied non-occupational risk factors for HIV infection. The vast majority of the study participants were drawn from areas where the prevalence of HIV infection and AIDS cases are substantially greater than the national average. Study participants received the ELISA test for HIV antibodies. All 112 of the participants tested negative for HIV antibodies. These results are encouraging, as they failed to reveal unrecognized occupational transmission of HIV infection among dialysis workers."
17502,0.005,1.0000,"Concerns about the risks of HIV infection among drug injectors have eclipsed concerns about the prevalence and transmission of hepatitis, and in particular hepatitis B virus infection. Findings are reported from surveys undertaken with two separate community-recruited samples of drug injectors in London collected in 1992 (n = 505) and in 1993 (n = 507). Anonymized confirmed testing of saliva shows 51.5% of drug injectors in 1992 and 47.9% in 1993 to be antibody positive to the core antigen of hepatitis B virus (anti-HBc). Approximately half of the drug injectors confirmed as anti-HBc positive were unaware that they had been infected with hepatitis. Anti-HIV-1 prevalence was considerably lower at 7.0% in 1992 and 6.9% in 1993. Multivariate analyses showed anti-HBc positivity to be most likely among older injectors with longer injecting careers who had a history of having shared used needles and syringes. HIV-1 positivity was also associated with a history of having shared injecting equipment as well as with recent sharing (i.e. in the last 6 months). Unlike anti-HBc positivity, there were no associations between HIV-1 positivity and age or length of injecting career. Younger injectors with shorter injecting careers were more likely to report recent sharing of used injecting equipment than older injectors with longer injecting careers. We note the potential for continued transmission of HBV and HIV-1, particularly among younger injectors. We recommend an integrated strategy to maximize the health of drug injectors, of which HIV and HBV prevention is a part. There is a need to widen the availability of HBV vaccinations for HBV negative drug injectors and their sexual partners and for clear guidelines to drug injectors about the relative efficacy of bleach to disinfect injecting equipment of HBV and HIV."
18868,0.005,1.0000,"Dialysis patients are at risk for contracting blood-borne infections, including hepatitis viruses (HBV and HCV). The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of HBV and HCV infection among hamodialysis patients in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Study subjects comprised 81 Bahraini and 34 Saudi dialysis patients, and as control 7714 Bahraini and 2330 Saudi blood donors. Serologic markers of HBV (HBsAg, anti-HBc) and HCV (anti-HCV) were determined by EIA and confirmed by PCR (HBV) and RT-PCR (HCV). Higher prevalence of HCV (9.240% vs 0.300%, P <.001), HBsAg (5.88% vs 0.620%; P <.001), but not anti-HBc (1.7% vs 4.6%; P =.01) were seen in patients compared to controls, respectively. When compared to Bahrainis, higher prevalence of HBsAg (11.8% vs 3.7%) and anti-HCV (14.7% vs 7.4%) were seen among Saudi patients, respectively. Double HCV infection was frequent, and the most prevalent types were HCV1a/1b plus HCV4 in Bahraini, and HCV 2/2a plus HCV 4 among Saudi dialysis patients. Our results are the first report on viral hepatitis among dialysis patients in Bahrain, and the first to compare HBV/HCV rates among dialysis patients in the Eastern Arabian peninsula, and confirms other results that documented increased HBV and HCV infection among dialysis patients. Future studies aimed at assessing the status and to monitor the progress of viral hepatitis infection among dialyzed and transfused patients will have a strong impact on patient diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment."
5780,0.005,1.0000,"This study describes how hospital-at-home care (HHC) use by persons with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (PWA) has changed since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). For this study, all adult PWA (877) admitted for the first time to the HHC program, established for PWAs in the metropolitan area of Rome, between January 1994 and December 1998, were enrolled. Temporal changes in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated. For subjects who concluded their first HHC cycle (851/877), the reasons for ending the service were assessed over time. From 1994 to 1998, the proportion of patients admitted to HHC of those living with AIDS in the Rome area decreased significantly (from 15.1% to 7.5%), while the median CD4+ cell count at HHC entry increased significantly. The proportion of patients referred to outpatient services at the end of their cycle of HHC increased sevenfold from 1994 to 1998, with a steep increase between 1996 and 1997. In multivariate analysis, only the use of triple-combination ART was significantly associated with referral to outpatient care (odds ratio [OR] = 4.26; 95%, confidence interval [CI] = 1.94-9.34). The results suggest that HHC use by PWAs in the ART era has diminished, while the HHC use pattern has also changed: there is a growing tendency to provide care to patients with less advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, prior to the beneficial effects of drugs, and the consequent referral to outpatient care."
7792,0.005,1.0000,"In this article we analyse how the costs of treating patients with HIV infection in the US have changed over time, with an emphasis on the relationship between inpatient hospitalization costs and the costs of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We examine how HIV treatment modes have evolved by comparing the pre-HAART treatment period before 1996-7 with the subsequent use of HAART. We describe the sources of data on HIV healthcare service utilization, the costs of those services, and the differences between the annual costs of treating all patients with different stages of HIV and the lifetime costs of treating a person with HIV from the time of infection. The major question in estimating HIV treatment costs and their components is how to incorporate a complete set of services utilized from all providers of HIV treatment for a representative sample of patients with HIV. The literature reviewed varies significantly on both of these factors. Although the hospitalization of patients with HIV has been declining over the past 2 decades, this rate of decrease accelerated after the introduction of HAART. Initially, the declines in hospitalization and its associated costs were greater than the increases in drug therapy costs, so the annual total costs of treating patients with HIV decreased. However, subsequent studies failed to show decreases in overall annual treatment costs, given rising drug costs and increases in hospitalizations due to complications from, or resistance to, HAART and due to other diseases impacting HIV-infected patients. Although the lifetime costs of treating a person with HIV have also increased, this treatment has resulted in substantial gains in the length and quality of life for those living with HIV."
15901,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of ocular diseases in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients in Washington, DC in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This was a cross-sectional study of patients with HIV who were seen by the ophthalmology consultation service between September 2003 and May 2011 at a single academic institution in Washington, DC. Medical history and ophthalmic findings were reviewed. Patients with complete laboratory data dated within 3 months of their presenting eye examination were included. Descriptive statistics were performed. The records of 151 patients were included in the final analysis. All patients had complete laboratory data dated within 3 months of their presenting eye examination. Sixty-eight (45 %) patients and fifty-eight (50 %) of those with a diagnosis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were diagnosed with an HIV-related ophthalmic disease. The leading anterior segment disease was herpes zoster ophthalmicus and the leading posterior segment disease was HIV retinopathy. Of the 151 included patients, 78 (52 %) were receiving HAART at the time of the examination. Thirty-one (42 %) of those not receiving HAART were diagnosed with an HIV-related ophthalmic disease. In this study, we find that the overall prevalence of ocular disease has decreased since the introduction of HAART. However, HIV patients continue to be predisposed to developing ophthalmic disease at higher rates than the general population. Visual dysfunction remains an important source of morbidity in HIV patients, particularly in those with AIDS. Measures for improvement include increased communication between infectious disease specialists and ophthalmologists to ensure adherence to HAART and routine eye examinations."
12292,0.005,1.0000,"Despite major advances in the treatment and survival of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), weight loss and wasting remain common problems. In the HIV-infected population, weight loss is associated with lower CD4+ cell counts and is an independent predictor of mortality. The etiology of weight loss and wasting is complex and multifactorial. We discuss, on the basis of a large longitudinal cohort that examined nutritional status in HIV infection, data on weight loss and wasting from the present clinical era. The definition, prevalence, and significance of HIV-associated weight loss and wasting are summarized. The etiology of weight loss is discussed for 2 main categories: inadequate nutrient intake and altered metabolism. Finally, studies of interventions to treat HIV-associated weight loss and wasting are discussed. This information is intended to raise awareness among health care providers of HIV-infected patients that weight loss and wasting remain important acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining conditions, despite the advent of HAART."
12383,0.005,1.0000,"Weight loss is reported by more than 20% of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-monoinfected patients treated with the peg-interferon (peg-IFN) and ribavirin combination. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors of severe weight loss (> or =10%) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) / HCV-coinfected patients participating in a randomized, controlled 48-week trial comparing peg-IFN alpha 2b plus ribavirin with IFN alpha-2b plus ribavirin. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify links with antiretroviral treatments, anti-HCV therapy and clinical and laboratory findings. One hundred eleven (28.9%) of 383 patients who received at least one dose of anti-HCV treatment subsequently had severe weight loss. Among patients who took at least 80% of the planned total dose, severe weight loss occurred in 74 patients (32.7%). In multivariate analysis, age >40 years [hazard ratio (HR), 1.59; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.31; P = 0.016], body mass index (BMI) >22 (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.16 to 2.55; P = 0.0069), peg-IFN alpha-2b (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.69; P = 0.0022) and female sex (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.43; P = 0.027) were associated with severe weight loss. In contrast, patients taking non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)-containing antiretroviral regimens were less likely to lose weight (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.96; P = 0.034). Lipodystrophy tended to occur more frequently in patients who had severe weight loss than in the other patients (26.1%vs 17.6%; P = 0.0682) and patients whose weight loss >5% persisted 24 weeks after the completion of anti-HCV therapy (n = 58 / 111) were more likely to be receiving stavudine-based antiretroviral therapy, suggesting that mitochondrial toxicity plays some role in weight loss. These findings show that severe weight loss is a frequent side effect of anti-HCV therapy in HIV / HCV-coinfected patients. The underlying mechanisms remain to be identified."
16129,0.005,1.0000,"Tenofovir (TFV) is eliminated by renal excretion, which is mediated through multidrug-resistant protein 2 (MRP2) and MRP4, encoded by ABCC2 and ABCC4, respectively. Genetic polymorphisms of these transporters may affect the plasma concentrations of tenofovir. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of genetic and nongenetic factors on tenofovir plasma concentrations. A cross-sectional study was performed in Thai HIV-infected patients aged ≥18 years who had been receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate at 300 mg once daily for at least 6 months. A middose tenofovir plasma concentration was obtained. Multivariate analysis was performed to investigate whether there was an association between tenofovir plasma concentrations and demographic data, including age, sex, body weight, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hepatitis B virus coinfection, hepatitis C virus coinfection, duration of tenofovir treatment, concomitant use of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, and polymorphisms of ABCC2 and ABCC4. A total of 150 Thai HIV-infected patients were included. The mean age of the patients was 43.9 ± 7.2 years. The mean tenofovir plasma concentration was 100.3 ± 52.7 ng/ml. In multivariate analysis, a low body weight, a low eGFR, the concomitant use of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, and the ABCC4 4131T → G variation (genotype TG or GG) were independently associated with higher tenofovir plasma concentrations. After adjusting for weight, eGFR, and the concomitant use of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, a 30% increase in the mean tenofovir plasma concentration was observed in patients having the ABCC4 4131 TG or GG genotype. Both genetic and nongenetic factors affect tenofovir plasma concentrations. These factors should be considered when adjusting tenofovir dosage regimens to ensure the efficacy and safety of a drug. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT01138241.)."
1880,0.005,1.0000,"Sexually transmitted infections affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 and -2) and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) remain incurable, urging the development of new prevention strategies. While current prophylactic technologies are dependent on strict user adherence to achieve efficacy, there is a dearth of delivery vehicles that provide discreet and convenient administration, combined with prolonged-delivery of active agents. To address these needs, we created electrospun fibers (EFs) comprised of FDA-approved polymers, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(DL-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLCL), to provide sustained-release and in vitro protection against HIV-1 and HSV-2. PLGA and PLCL EFs, incorporating the antiretroviral, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), exhibited sustained-release for up to 4 weeks, and provided complete in vitro protection against HSV-2 and HIV-1 for 24h and 1 wk, respectively, based on the doses tested. In vitro cell culture and EpiVaginal tissue tests confirmed the safety of fibers in vaginal and cervical cells, highlighting the potential of PLGA and PLCL EFs as multipurpose next-generation drug delivery vehicles."
14145,0.005,1.0000,"Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in children ages 2 years and older and is recommended by the World Health Organization for use as a preferred first-line nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor in adults and adolescents ages 10 years and older. The simplicity of once daily dosing, few metabolic side effects and efficacy against hepatitis B virus make TDF suitable for use in a large scale program. Unlike thymidine analoge nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs); tenofovir does not induce multi-NRTI resistance mutations, so more NRTI options are available for future second-line-regimens. Fixed-dose combinations of TDF with other ARVs as a single tablet regimen are now widely available for adults and adolescents, but none are available for young children. Current information on TDF including the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability in children and adolescents was reviewed. A dosing regimen according to body-weight-band has been established for pediatric use. Safety concerns of TDF mainly relate to its effects on renal function and bone mineral density. Regular monitoring of renal function in high-risk patients, including those on other nephrotoxic drugs, may be warranted to detect adverse renal effects. Long-term-data on renal and bone outcomes among HIV-infected children is needed. Lessons learned from clinical studies will help clinicians balance the risks and benefits of TDF and design appropriate antiretroviral regimens for children in different circumstances."
18110,0.005,1.0000,"Non-subtype B viruses cause the vast majority of new human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections worldwide and are thus the major focus of international vaccine efforts. Although their geographic dissemination is carefully monitored, their immunogenic and biological properties remain largely unknown, in part because well-characterized virological reference reagents are lacking. In particular, full-length clones and sequences are rare, since subtype classification is frequently based on small PCR-derived viral fragments. There are only five proviral clones available for viruses other than subtype B, and these represent only 3 of the 10 proposed (group M) sequence subtypes. This lack of reference sequences also confounds the identification and analysis of mosaic (recombinant) genomes, which appear to be arising with increasing frequency in areas where multiple sequence subtypes cocirculate. To generate a more representative panel of non-subtype B reference reagents, we have cloned (by long PCR or lambda phage techniques) and sequenced 10 near-full-length HIV-1 genomes (lacking less than 80 bp of long terminal repeat sequences) from primary isolates collected at major epicenters of the global AIDS pandemic. Detailed phylogenetic analyses identified six that represented nonrecombinant members of HIV-1 subtypes A (92UG037.1), C (92BR025. 8), D (84ZR085.1 and 94UG114.1), F (93BR020.1), and H (90CF056.1), the last two comprising the first full-length examples of these subtypes. Four others were found to be complex mosaics of subtypes A and C (92RW009.6), A and G (92NG083.2 and 92NG003.1), and B and F (93BR029.4), again emphasizing the impact of intersubtype recombination on global HIV-1 diversification. Although a number of clones had frameshift mutations or translational stop codons in major open reading frames, all the genomes contained a complete set of genes and three had intact genomic organizations without inactivating mutations. Reconstruction of one of these (94UG114.1) yielded replication-competent virus that grew to high titers in normal donor peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures. This panel of non-subtype B reference genomes should prove valuable for structure-function studies of genetically diverse viral gene products, the generation of subtype-specific immunological reagents, and the production of DNA- and protein-based subunit vaccines directed against a broader spectrum of viruses."
19961,0.005,1.0000,"The pharmacokinetics and safety of hyperimmune anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) intravenous immunoglobulin (HIVIG) were evaluated in the first 28 maternal-infant pairs enrolled in a randomized, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)-controlled trial of HIVIG maternal-infant HIV transmission prophylaxis. Using 200 mg/kg, mean half-life and volume of distribution (Vd) in women were 15 days and 72 mL/kg, respectively, after one and 32 days and 154 mL/kg after three monthly infusions, with stable 4 mL/kg/day clearance. Transplacental passage occurred. Newborn single-dose half-life, Vd, and clearance were 30 days, 143 mL/kg, and 4 mL/kg/day, respectively. HIVIG rapidly cleared maternal serum immune complex-dissociated p24 antigen, and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were stable. Mild to moderate adverse clinical effects occurred in 2 of 103 maternal and 2 of 25 infant infusions. No adverse hematologic, blood chemistry, or immunologic effects were seen. HIVIG is well-tolerated in HIV-infected pregnant women and their newborns, clears antigenemia, crosses the placenta, and exhibits pharmacokinetics similar to those of other immunoglobulin preparations."

Information on medical history and HIV risk-related behaviour was collected by means of a standardized, computer-coded medical record. Of the 1222 intravenous drug users in this study, 72.3% were men, 26.9% were women and 0.8% were transsexual, with 60.1% of the total claiming exclusive heterosexuality. Of the sample, 40.2% were current intravenous drug users, and 86.8% recorded having shared needles and syringes. Among this sample, the over-all prevalence of HIV seropositivity was 14.5%. Of subjects who were diagnosed as HIV seropositive, 43.8% were homosexual men, 13.1% were bisexual men and 5.3% were heterosexual men. Of all intravenous drug users, 49.9% had a history of at least one sexually-transmitted disease, with 21.8% reporting a history of more than one. Fifty-two per cent of the sample reported that they had been infected with hepatitis B previously. There was no over-all increase in the annual rate of HIV infection among this population of intravenous drug users. The sexual activity and prevalence of hepatitis and other sexually-transmitted diseases among this group are suggestive of widespread, continuing risk behaviour."
16480,0.005,1.0000,"Serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, HCV genotypes and liver function tests were evaluated in a series of 189 unselected, consecutive anti-HCV positive intravenous drug users (IVDUs). Serum HCV RNA was detected in 106/189 patients. Abnormal liver function tests were associated with alcohol abuse, but not with the presence of serum HCV RNA. Among 109 patients retested after a mean follow-up of 21 months, 41 were intermittently serum HCV RNA positive. Patients persistently negative had more commonly a past history of acute hepatitis. A history of prostitution and/or a pattern of abuse involving >30 injections per week were related to infection by genotype 3a. In conclusion, serum HCV RNA is either transiently or persistently detectable in most anti-HCV positive IVDUs, but bears no association with abnormal liver biochemistry. Infection by HCV-3a is more common in IVDUs with more deviant life styles. In those cases where serum HCV RNA is found repeatedly negative, HCV infection may have been cleared, possibly through an episode of acute hepatitis."
17573,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate health-related quality of life in HIV-infected intravenous drug users registered but not engaged in HIV outpatient care (missing ≥2 outpatient appointments over 1 year or non-attendance for ≥6 months) we conducted a cross-sectional study to examine health-related quality of life of HIV-infected intravenous drug users registered for care at an inner city HIV unit. EQ-5D, SF-36, SF-6D, mood disorder, clinical and substance misuse data were collected. Mean scores and preference derived utility scores were calculated. Statistical relationships between health-related quality of life and other variables were explored using univariate and multivariate analysis. Fifty-five patients were recruited, 64% were males. The mean anxiety value was 11.44 (anxious) and mean depression score was 9.3 (borderline depressed). The mean EQ-5D utility was 0.45 (95% CI 0.35, 0.55) and mean SF-6D utility was 0.52 (95% CI 0.48, 0.55). There was no statistical relationship between HIV indices, substance misuse and EQ-5D and SF-6D utility. Anxiety and depression were significantly correlated with EQ-5D and SF-6D utility values on univariate and multivariate analysis. Health-related quality of life was reduced in this HIV-infected intravenous drug user population. Whilst hepatitis C co-infection and substance misuse did not affect health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression had a significant impact on it. "
14183,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence among a selected sample of 169 high-risk homeless men residing in a congregate shelter in New York City, NY, was 62%. Seropositivity for HIV correlated significantly with intravenous drug use (odds ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 4.4) and active tuberculosis (odds ratio, 7.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.4 to 13.5). Most cases of active tuberculosis were among homeless men with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex; and significant CD4 lymphocyte depletion was associated with active tuberculosis. Total time homeless correlated positively with active and latent tuberculosis infection. Compliance rates with return for HIV antibody test results, medications, and follow-up visits were 70%, suggesting a significant degree of knowledge, awareness, and personal concern regarding HIV infection among homeless men; yet 28% of homeless intravenous drug users continue active drug injection, despite HIV infection. Cohabitation in overcrowded congregate dormitories creates a risk of airborne transmission of tuberculosis, which is a common reactivation infection in HIV-seropositive homeless men. Medically appropriate housing should be provided to such homeless persons, and expanded HIV antibody testing, counseling, and medical services on site should be offered to residents of shelters."
17015,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence rates of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) were 5.6% and 34% in 144 homosexual men in Seattle. Prevalence rates were only 0.9% and 3.6% in 111 heterosexual male venereal disease clinic patients with nongonococcal urethritis, and also 0.9% and 3.6% in 111 healthy men undergoing routine physical examinations. Thus, previous exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV) was estimated to be 8.8 times greater for homosexual men than for heterosexual men. Four of four HBsAg positive sera from homosexual men were subtyped as ""ad,"" whereas subtype ""ay"" is preponderant in intravenous drug abusers. Future public health measures to control HBV infection should address the prevention of sexually transmitted HBV infection among homosexual men."
11958,0.005,1.0000,"A study among heterosexual men and women with multiple sexual partners was carried out to assess the seroprevalence of antibody against hepatitis C virus (HCV). The 468 participants were recruited among visitors to the Clinic for Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Amsterdam. Sera were tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Ortho), a recombinant-based immunoblot assay (RIBA; Chiron), and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 468 persons were tested, and seven (1.5%) were found ELISA positive. Another 25 (5%) were ELISA indeterminate. Six of the seven ELISA-positive cases were RIBA positive. Further serum samples from five HCV ELISA-positive persons were tested by PCR, and four were found to be positive. The HCV ELISA-positive/RIBA-indeterminate reaction was PCR negative. None of the 17 RIBA-tested sera of the ELISA-indeterminate group yielded a positive result. There was a good correlation between an ELISA optical density/cut-off ratio greater than 2 and a positive RIBA result. The risk factor for HCV appeared to be the type of sexual partner, i.e., belonging to a ""high-risk"" group for human immunodeficiency virus infection and origin from hepatitis B-endemic countries. It is concluded that HCV may be transmitted through heterosexual contact but probably with low efficiency."

18239,0.005,1.0000,"A serologic survey of 4863 patients attending two inner-city sexually transmitted disease clinics was conducted in 1988 1 year after an initial survey to reassess the prevalence and associated risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The HIV seroprevalence rates had not changed significantly (5.2% in 1987, 4.9% in 1988), and remained higher among men (5.6%) than among women (3.6%). The HIV seroprevalence increased steadily with age, to 34 years in women and to 39 years in men. Of patients with a reactive syphilis serologic test result, 24.3% were HIV infected compared with 3.5% of patients with a nonreactive test for syphilis. In multivariate analysis, a reactive serologic test for syphilis was significantly associated with HIV infection in all major risk behavior categories. Among heterosexuals who denied parenteral drug abuse, HIV infection rates were 6.8 and 8.7 times greater for women and men, respectively, who had a reactive serologic test for syphilis. Evidence of heterosexual transmission of HIV was further suggested by a change in HIV seroprevalence in women from 3.0% in 1987 to 3.6% in 1988, a male to female HIV infection ratio of 1.6, and 3.0% prevalence of infection among patients who denied established risk factors. This was most evident among those younger than 25 years, in whom 72% of infected women and 46.2% of infected men denied high-risk behaviors. These data demonstrate the strong association between syphilis and HIV infection and the importance of heterosexual HIV transmission in patients attending sexually transmitted disease clinics. This study underscores the need for a more comprehensive control program for sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis and HIV infection."

7214,0.005,1.0000,"To define the role of sexual transmission in the spread of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a seroprevalence study of antibodies against HCV was performed in populations at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases. Subjects included 310 female prostitutes, 88 clients of prostitutes, 168 homosexual men and 147 stable heterosexual partners of index cases reactive for anti-HCV (98 of whom were partners of drug addicts coinfected with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]). All subjects denied prior transfusion or intravenous drug use. Controls were 400 voluntary blood donors selected randomly from first-time donors. The prevalence of anti-HCV by enzyme immunoassay, confirmed by a second-generation recombinant immunoblot assay, was 6.4% in prostitutes, 6.8% in clients of prostitutes, 4.2% in homosexual men, 7.4% in heterosexual partners of index cases and 1.2% in random donors. However, the anti-HCV prevalence in stable heterosexual partners of HCV-positive/HIV-positive index cases was 2.2 times higher than in stable heterosexual partners of index cases reactive for anti-HCV only (9.2% vs. 4.1%), and sexual partners of index cases coinfected with HCV and HIV were almost three times more likely to be infected with HIV than with HCV (25.5% vs. 9.2%). These data suggest that HCV infection may be sexually transmitted but with low efficiency and that this efficiency could be increased in the presence of coexistent HIV infection in the index case."

The median duration of the warts before and after the start of treatment of seven HIV infected and 10 non-infected heterosexual men was similar. In homosexual men, however, the duration of the lesions in 15 HIV infected patients was greater before and after treatment than in 22 non-HIV infected men. As the median number of CD4+ cells in the peripheral blood was significantly lower in homosexual than heterosexual men infected with HIV, the difference in the course of anogenital warts in homosexual compared with heterosexual men may reflect different degrees of immunosuppression."

To determine the status of HIV infection in a Mississippi adolescent population, we evaluated seroprevalence rates for adolescents attending Mississippi State Department of Health STD clinics from 1988 to 1990. During this 2-year period, 9855 adolescents (aged 13 to 20 years) attended STD clinics, and HIV antibody was confirmed in 39 (seroprevalence rate 4.0/1000; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.7 to 5.2). Seropositive rates were almost equal for male and female subjects (4.1/1000 and 3.8/1000, respectively), suggesting predominantly heterosexual transmission. Rates among blacks were 3.5 times higher than among whites. Adolescents with HIV infection were identified throughout the state, irrespective of urban centers. Rates among the smallest counties (ie, population less than 25,000) were not significantly different from those of the largest counties (ie, population greater than 100,000). Mississippi's rank in the top 10 states for other STDs and the state's high teenage pregnancy rate make it an epicenter of the HIV epidemic among adolescents."

They were recruited from visitors to the Clinic for Sexually Transmitted Diseases of the Municipal Health Service. Half of the study group was born in the Netherlands, 13% in Surinam or the Dutch Antilles, and 8% in Turkey or Morocco. Seventy percent were involved in commercial sex. Three persons were positive for HTLV-I, with serum antibodies against p19, p24, p28, gp46, and gp61 in Western immunoblot (WIB) and radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA). Two of them originated from Surinam and the third was a Dutch woman.

There were no significant differences in the prevalence of antibodies to cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis A and B viruses, herpes simplex virus, syphilis, and toxoplasmosis among the African and US patients with AIDS, African heterosexual controls, and US homosexual men. However, these four groups all demonstrated a significantly greater prevalence of antibodies to each of these infectious agents compared with US heterosexual men. Immunologic studies demonstrated a significant elevation of activated lymphocytes (HLA-DR and T3 positive) and immune complexes in both AIDS populations and African heterosexual and US homosexual populations, compared with the US heterosexual population. These data demonstrate that the immune systems of African heterosexuals, similar to those of US homosexual men, are in a chronically activated state associated with chronic viral and parasitic antigenic exposure, which may cause them to be particularly susceptible to HIV infection or disease progression."

This is the first study in Brazil evaluating HPV16 variants in women with (n = 19) and without (n = 22) HIV infection, as well as cervical lesions. Although non-European variants presented an almost 3-fold increase (13.6% vs. 36.8%) among HIV-positive women, associations between HPV16 variants and HIV infection did not reach statistical significance (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.15). No associations were found between non-European variants and HSIL (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.41), although a significant association was observed between European variants and HSIL among HIV-negative women (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.01). In conclusion, in HIV-negative women the HPV16 European variants seem to influence the occurrence of HSIL, whereas in HIV-positive women, similar roles are atributted to both variants."
4945,0.005,1.0000,"A patient who underwent living donor kidney transplantation was infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) that resulted in persistent EBV infection and EBV-associated chronic hepatitis, determined by abnormally elevated anti-EBV antibody titers and high frequency of EBV-infected B lymphocytes. Despite decreases in immunosuppressant doses, persistent EBV infection and chronic hepatitis persisted for several years. Therapy using anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) virtually eliminated peripheral B lymphocytes and EBV-encoded small RNA 1 (EBER-1)-positive cells. Moreover, hepatic enzyme levels normalized and histological findings indicated marked improvement in hepatic inflammation. Although peripheral CD20(+) B lymphocyte and EBER-1-positive cell levels began to increase 4 months after the end of therapy, the number of EBER-1-positive cells remained very low, and liver function test results remained within normal ranges. The present case illustrates the significance of early diagnosis, monitoring of viral load, and vigorous management of EBV-related disorders associated with organ transplantation."
15909,0.005,1.0000,"Direct population sequencing and reverse hybridization (line probe assay [LiPA])-based methods are the most common methods for detecting hepatitis B virus (HBV) drug resistance mutations, although only mutations present in viral quasispecies with a prevalence of > or =20% can be detected by sequencing, and only known mutations are detected by LiPA. Massively parallel ultradeep pyrosequencing (UDPS; GS FLX platform) was used to analyze HBV quasispecies in reverse transcriptase (RT) and hepatitis B S antigen (HBsAg) from five drug-naive patients and eight drug-resistant patients. Eight primer pairs were used to obtain partially overlapping amplicons, covering the RT gene from codons 1 to 288 and the complete overlapping HBsAg sequence. A 1% mutation frequency was selected as the cutoff based on an error rate estimated on plasmid DNA. This technology enabled simultaneous analysis of between 2,852 and 18,016 clonally amplified fragments from each patient. The results indicate that UDPS has a relative sensitivity much higher than both direct sequencing and LiPA. In addition, the UDPS results are quantitative, allowing establishment of the relative frequency of both known mutations and novel substitutions. Some of the detected RT substitutions led to changes also in HBsAg. On the whole, genotype D presented a higher heterogeneity than genotype A. Considering the high quantity of information that can be provided by a single test from one patient, the short turnaround time, the information on substitution frequency, and the detection of rare variants, there are strong advantages conferred by UDPS, and the new method could play a relevant role in the clinical management of HBV infection and therapy."

The overall estimated median survival of patients with AIDS increased substantially from 8 months in 1987 to 16 months in 1988, although this increase was not significant by the log-rank test. However, the differences in hazard rates were larger at the beginning of the survival curve: between 1987 and 1988 the proportion surviving at 1 year increased from 41 to 62%, compared to an increase of the proportion surviving at 2 years from 30 to 35% (Breslow test, p value 0.008). AIDS patients diagnosed between 1988 and 1992 (n = 755) were analyzed in more detail. Multivariate survival analysis revealed a shorter survival for those with residence in Eastern Austria, recipients of blood products, individuals with unknown transmission risk, those presenting with two AIDS indicator diseases and those with higher age at AIDS diagnosis. Candidal esophagitis as AIDS indicator disease was associated with longer survival. One hundred eighty-eight of the 755 AIDS patients (24.9%) died within the first 3 months after diagnosis of AIDS. We conclude that the survival time for AIDS patients has improved considerably after 1987, but survival is still very poor. Several factors have been shown to predict survival of patients with AIDS in Austria. Death within the first 3 months after the diagnosis of AIDS occurred at a relatively high frequency in Austrian AIDS patients. This may be caused by difficulties in the use of health care facilities or by the lack of awareness of HIV infection before diagnosis of AIDS either by patient or care provider."

Ten patients who were receiving combination antiretroviral drug therapy were studied and their peripheral blood CD34+ CFU-Cs were measured prior to, 1 month after, and 4 to 6 months after the commencement of therapy. The levels of CD4+ T cells increased significantly in these patients (paired t test, p = 0.0027) and plasma viral load became undetectable in all but one patient studied. Measurements of the CFU-Cs showed that their levels tended to increase on the commencement of therapy, and these levels became significantly higher than baseline by 4-6 months (paired t test, p = 0.0293). Analysis of the different colony phenotype demonstrated that the main contributor to this increase consisted of burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) cells. These data also demonstrated that there was an inverse correlation between the rise in CFU-Cs at 4-6 months compared with CD4+ cell, CD8+ cell, and neutrophil counts, and hemoglobin concentration, at baseline. The demonstrated increase in the levels of CD34+ CFU-Cs suggests that HIV-1 may have an inhibitory effect on these cells in vivo, and that this inhibition may be abrogated by suppression of viral replication."

They also seem to compose a major problem to patients subjected to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) due to intensive chemoradiotherapy. In this study, the sera of 42 patients were investigated before and after BMT to detect the presence of HBV markers and to test their liver function (LF). Being followed-up for 3-12 months after BMT, 12 out of 27 were found to have altered HBV markers according to the classification of the following: seroconversion of HBsAg, clearance of HBsAb, appearance of HBeAg, clearance of HBeAb, and acute hepatitis. Thirty-seven out of 42 patients (88.1%) were found in routine LF test to develop one or more abnormality; however, 90% of them turned normal within one year after BMT. Only one patient died of complications associated with fulminant hepatitis. In conclusion, the previous hepatic damage from HBV infection appears unlikely to increase the risk of posttransplant morbidity and mortality."
4948,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) infections cause severe immunodeficiency in humans, although HIV-2 is associated frequently with reduced virulence and pathogenicity compared to HIV-1. Genetic determinants that play a role in HIV pathogenesis are relatively poorly understood but nef has been implicated in inducing a more pathogenic phenotype in vivo. However, relatively little is known about the role of nef in HIV-2 pathogenesis. To address this, the genetic composition of 44 nef alleles from 37 HIV-2-infected individuals in Portugal, encompassing a wide spectrum of disease associations, CD4 counts and virus load, has been assessed. All nef alleles were subtype A, with no evidence of gross deletions, truncations or disruptions in the nef-encoding sequence; all were full-length and intact. HIV-2 long terminal repeat sequences were conserved and also indicated subtype A infections. Detailed analysis of motifs that mediate nef function in HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus, such as CD4 downregulation and putative SH2/SH3 interactions, revealed significant natural variation. In particular, the central P(104)xxPLR motif exhibited wide interpatient variation, ranging from an HIV-1-like tetra-proline structure (PxxP)(3) to a disrupted minimal core motif (P(104)xxQLR). The P(107)-->Q substitution was associated with an asymptomatic phenotype (Fisher's exact test, P=0.026) and low virus loads. These data indicate that discrete differences in the nef gene sequence rather than gross structural changes are more likely to play a role in HIV-2 pathogenesis mediated via specific functional interactions."

IgD+ memory B cell percentages did not correlate with CD4+ cell percentages (P =. 027) or disease duration (P =. 026). Naive/transitional and IgD- memory B cell numbers were not affected.

12382,0.005,1.0000,"Sexual transmission is now the most frequent means of diffusion of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Even if the underlying mechanism is still largely unknown, there is a consensus regarding the key role played by mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) in capturing HIV through contact with infected subepithelial lymphocytes, and their capacity to spread HIV by trans-infection. We found that HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) reduced virion endocytosis strongly in monocyte-derived immature (i) DCs contacting HIV-1-infected cells, and that this phenomenon led to dramatically impaired trans-infection activity. This inhibitory effect was not mediated by the block of viral protease activity, as it was also operative when donor cells were infected with a PI-resistant HIV-1 strain. The block of virus maturation imposed by PIs did not correlate with significant variations in the levels of virus expression in donor cells or of Gag/Env virion incorporation. Also, PIs did not affect the endocytosis activity of DCs. In contrast, we noticed that PI treatment inhibited the formation of cell-cell conjugates whilst reducing the expression of ICAM-1 in target iDCs. Our results contribute to a better delineation of the mechanisms underlying HIV-1 trans-infection activity in DCs, whilst having implications for the development of new anti-HIV microbicide strategies."
6272,0.005,1.0000,"Taiwan is an endemic area for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. There are more than 3-million carriers on this island. Chronic HBV infections may result in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, which are common in Taiwan. However little information is available concerning the immunity and the susceptibility to HBV among the expatriate-population (non-permanent residents from foreign countries) in Taiwan. Thus controversies exist on the indications for HBV vaccination among the foreign visitors and expatriates. This study evaluated the serological status of those who attended the Kaohsiung Adventist Clinic between May 1986 and August 1989. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody (anti-HBs) were determined by ELISA. A total of 152 expatriates (85M, 67F, aged 5 to 64 years, duration of residence in Taiwan: 2 weeks to 11 years) without previous HBV vaccination, were tested. HBsAg and anti-HBs were not detected in 125 (82%). Anti-HBs was found in 22 (15%). There was no correlation between the duration of residence and anti-HBs positivity. However, there was an increased prevalence of anti-HBs with increasing age after 30. For those expatriates who were anti-HBs positive, 64% had a history of sexual contact with a partner from an endemic area of HBV. HBsAg was detected in 5 (3%). Three were symptomatic with abnormal liver function tests. Four had a history of sexual exposure. Their children were not antigenemic. It is concluded that most (greater than 82%) of the expatriates residing in southern Taiwan have no immunity to HBV and sexual contact is a major route (70%) of transmission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

2847,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1-infected patients are in chronic oxidative stress and clastogenic factors (CFs) are present in their plasma. CFs from patients with HIV are formed via superoxide anion radical and stimulate further superoxide production. The pathophysiolgic significance and the exact composition of the circulating clastogenic material in patients with HIV is unknown. Cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), are increased in the plasma of patients with HIV and TNF-alpha shows clastogenic activity in vitro. The aim of this clinical study was to compare levels of CF in HIV-1-positive patients with asymptomatic disease, opportunistic infections, and malignancies with those in HIV-1-negative control groups and to correlate CF activity with CD4+ T cell numbers, the cytokines (TNF-alpha, interleukin-2 [IL-2], IL-6), and the inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], neopterin, granulocyte elastase). CFs were significantly increased in all HIV-1-positive patients and in HIV-1-negative patients with malignant tumors. HIV-1-positive patients with Kaposi's sarcoma showed the highest CF activity in their plasma (p < 0.08). CFs appear very early in HIV infection, and they correlate negatively with CD4+ T cells, which are an indicator of disease activity. The presence of CF in the plasma of HIV-infected patients is not a general response to a viral infection because these factors are not increased in HIV-1-negative patients with viral infection (zoster). CFs are not specific for the HIV-1 infection; they also occur in HIV-1-negative patients with malignant tumors. There was a tendency towards a positive correlation (p < 0.14) between CF and TNF-alpha but there was no positive correlation of CF with IL-2, IL-6, CRP, elastase, and neopterin levels. This indicates that TNF-alpha may be among the components of CF in HIV-1-infected patients. In addition, other unidentified components may contribute to the clastogenic activity of the plasma or the composition of CF may vary from patient to patient. Further clinical studies with larger sample populations are necessary to analyze the composition of CF in HIV-1-positive patients."

Circulating autoantibodies were an independent predictor of anemia (odds ratio [OR]=5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-9.9), as strong as other known causes of anemia. The association of anti-EPO antibodies with anemia became stronger when the analysis was limited to the group of patients without any medical condition causing anemia (OR=10.4; 95% CI, 3.2-33.9). Moreover, the effect on hemoglobin levels remained significant even after adjusting for other anemia parameters. Anti-EPO autoantibodies were associated with higher EPO levels (r=.25, P=.012) and with a more prominent EPO response to anemia. Our findings suggest that autoimmunity, among other factors, may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV-1-related anemia."

The effects of virus persistence on innate immunity, including NK cell responses, and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We examined the frequency, phenotype, and function of peripheral blood CD3- CD56+ NK subsets in HIV+ and HCV+ patients and identified significantly reduced numbers of total NK cells and a striking shift in NK subsets, with a marked decrease in the CD56(dim) cell fraction compared to CD56(bright) cells, in both infections. This shift influenced the phenotype and functional capacity (gamma interferon production, killing) of the total NK pool. In addition, abnormalities in the functional capacity of the CD56(dim) NK subset were observed in HIV+ patients. The shared NK alterations were found to be associated with a significant reduction in serum levels of the innate cytokine interleukin 15 (IL-15). In vitro stimulation with IL-15 rescued NK cells of HIV+ and HCV+ patients from apoptosis and enhanced proliferation and functional activity. We hypothesize that the reduced levels of IL-15 present in the serum during HIV and HCV infections might impact NK cell homeostasis, contributing to the common alterations of the NK pool observed in these unrelated infections."

Twenty-seven HIV(+) patients with AHC (self-limited course: n = 10; chronic course: n = 17), 12 HIV(+) patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), 8 HIV monoinfected individuals, and 12 healthy controls were studied. NK cells were phenotypically analyzed by flow cytometry. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) secretion, degranulation (CD107a), and anti-HCV (= inhibition of HCV replication) activity of NK subpopulations were analyzed using the HuH7A2 HCVreplicon cell system. NK cell frequency did not differ significantly between HIV(+) patients with chronic and self-limited course of AHC. However, we found NK cells from patients with self-limiting infection to be significantly more effective in inhibiting HCV replication in vitro than NK cells from patients developing CHC. Of note, antiviral NK cell activity showed no significant correlation with NK cell degranulation, but was positively correlated with IFN-γ secretion, and blocking experiments confirmed an important role for IFN-γ in NK cell-mediated inhibition of HCV replication. Accordingly, NK cells from patients that spontaneously cleared the virus displayed a stronger IFN-γ secretion than those developing chronic infection. Finally, we observed high expression of NKG2D and NKp46, respectively, to be associated with self-limiting course of aHCV. Accordingly, we found that blocking of these NK cell receptors significantly impaired antiviral NK cell activity."

10369,0.005,1.0000,"1. INTRODUCTION. The latest statistics how that Japanese hemophilia patients infected with HIV-through clotting factor concentrates may survive more than 10 years after HIV-infection without showing an onset of AIDS [1]. Unfortunately, however, results of the recent surveillance have revealed that about half of hemophilia patients had also been infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [2]. Therefore, some hemophilia patients might suffer from hepatocellular carcinoma triggered by HCV after some latent periods. In the present study, we computed the life time expectancy of hemophilia patients with two risks of HIV-and HCV infections. 2. METHOD. We used the Weibull hazard function h(t) for the hazard rate from AIDS after infection with HIV-1. In order to describe the hazard rate arising from hepatocellular carcinoma after HCV infection, we utilized the theoretical function c(t) with two parameters that were obtained previously by ourselves from a case-controlled study on hepatocellular carcinoma patients infected with HCV through blood transfusion [3]. Substituting necessary parameters estimated for Japanese hemophilia patients into h(t), the life time expectancy t was computed by the following integration; tau=integral of exp(-integral of h(t')+c(t¿) dt') dt, where t' means the time after HIV-infection, and t¿ is a variable composed of tU and times of HIV-and HCV infections. 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. Without hepatocellular carcinoma, the life time expectancy tau of the patients infected with HIV-1 at the age of 20 was computed as 15.0 years. On the other hand, for the same patients with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma through HCV infection at the age of 10, 15, 20 and 25 years old, values of tau were computed at 12.2, 13.3, 14.1 and 14.4 years, respectively. Especially noticeable was the reduction of tau in cases of HCV infection was prior to HIV-infection. In the present computation, the two risks from HIV-1 and HCV infections were assumed to be additive because no explicit interaction between them has been reported yet. Various long term effects have been found with the development of HIV/HCV therapies; that should also take into account the survival estimation and therapy planning for HIV-1 infected patients in the coming years."

We characterized CD56(pos) populations in 11 injection drug users (IDUs) who remained uninfected despite being repeatedly exposed to HCV. NK profiles in exposed but uninfected (EU) individuals were compared with preinfection samples (median 90 days prior to HCV seroconversion) collected from 14 IDUs who were exposed and subsequently became infected (EI) and unexposed normal control subjects (n = 8). Flow cytometric analysis of CD56(pos) populations demonstrated that EUs had a higher proportion of CD56(low) mature (P = 0.0011) NK cells compared with EI subjects. Bead-isolated NKs ( > 90% purity) from EUs had significantly higher interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced cytolytic activity against the NK-sensitive cell line K562 at an effector-to-target ratio of 10:1 (P < 0.0001). NKp30, a natural cytotoxicity receptor involved in NK activation, is highest on NK/NT cells in EUs relative to infected subjects. Using the JFH-1 infection system, we demonstrated that NKp30(high) cells in the absence of exogenous stimulation significantly reduce infection of hepatocytes."

In multivariable analysis, a baseline creatinine above 133 micromol/l, a weight gain of more than 5 kg over the 2 years, female gender and a WHO stage 4 classification were all associated with greater improvements in creatinine clearance on HAART.

2893,0.005,1.0000,"We performed a phase I study of escalating dosages of 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (didanosine; ddI) in 19 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex in order (1) to establish the maximal tolerated dosage, (2) to determine the nature of toxic adverse effects, (3) to measure changes in levels of circulating human immunodeficiency virus p24 antigen and in CD4+ cell counts, and (4) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ddI. Almost all patients had received zidovudine therapy previously. The maximal tolerated dosage of ddI was found to be approximately 12 mg/(kg.d) when it was administered orally for 28 weeks. The major dosage-limiting adverse effects encountered were neuropathy, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. These occurred at dosages higher than those associated with decreases in levels of p24 antigen. The major toxic effects of ddI are different from those associated with zidovudine. At the proper dosage, ddI may prove to be an effective agent for the chronic treatment of infection with human immunodeficiency virus and should be especially useful in the treatment of patients who cannot tolerate zidovudine."
9472,0.005,1.0000,"Progression of HIV disease is often accompanied by weight loss and wasting. Gestational weight gain is a strong determinant of maternal and neonatal outcomes; however, the pattern and predictors of weight gain during pregnancy among HIV-positive women are unknown. We obtained monthly anthropometric measurements in a cohort of 957 pregnant women from Tanzania who were HIV infected. We estimated the weekly rate of weight gain at various points during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and computed rate differences between levels of sociodemographic, nutritional, immunologic, and parasitic variables at the first prenatal visit. The change in mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) from baseline to delivery was also examined. The rate of weight gain decreased progressively during pregnancy. There was an average decline of 1 cm in MUAC between weeks 12 and 38. Lower level of education and helminthic infections at first visit were associated with decreased adjusted rates of weight gain during the third trimester. High baseline MUAC, not contributing to household income, lower serum retinol and selenium concentrations, advanced clinical stage of HIV disease, and malaria infection were related to decreased rates of weight gain during the second trimester. Low baseline CD4 T-cell counts were related to a poorer pattern of weight gain throughout pregnancy. Prevention and treatment of parasitic infections and improvement of nutritional status are likely to enhance the pattern of gestational weight gain among HIV-infected women."

Included in the integrated analyses were 21 and 33 HIV-infected pediatric and adult patients, respectively, from three phase I-II studies. Data for 21 children and 18 adults who received intravenous doses of 0.125 to 2 and 0.5 to 1 mg/kg of body weight, respectively, were used for the determination of dosing guidelines; exposure data for 16 children and 15 adults who received oral doses of 1 to 2 and 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, were used to validate the dosing recommendations for children. Significant relationships were observed between total body clearance (in milliliters per minute) in children and adults combined and demographic parameters of age, body weight, and body surface area (R(2) = 0.77 to 0.80; P = 0.0001). Models of approximated pediatric dose based on clearance values and direct adult exposure yielded a stavudine dosage of 2 mg/kg/day for children of < or =30 kg of body weight and 1 mg/kg/day (adult dose) for children of >30 kg of body weight."
12796,0.005,1.0000,"Interferon and pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) are highly effective in patients with acute hepatitis caused by hepatitis C virus (acute hepatitis C, AHC), but the optimal timing of treatment is still under debate. In this open-labelled, uncontrolled trial, 19 patients with AHC, including 12 intravenous drug users (IVDUs), were treated early in the course of the infection with peg-IFN-alpha2b for 12 weeks. Diagnosis was made according to standardized criteria. The HCV RNA decay was analysed during the first 4 weeks of treatment by quantitative branched-DNA and by qualitative RT-PCR. Of the patients, 11 (58%) had genotype 1. Sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved in 14 out of 19 patients (74%) and the mean time to achieve a negative RT-PCR for HCV RNA was 2.5 weeks. The SVR was associated by univariate analysis with peg-IFN dosage < or = 1.33 microg/kg/week (P = 0.026) and HCV RNA level at onset of therapy (P = 0.017). Using a logistic regression model, only peg-IFN dosage > or = 1.33 microg/kg/weekly was significantly associated with SVR (P = 0.0379, OR: 14.7; 95% CI: 1.16-185.2). The SVR was 100% and 83.3%, respectively, in genotype 1 and non-1 infected patients treated with a dosage equal to or higher than 1.33 microg/kg, compared with 40% and 50%, respectively, in those who received a lower dosage. Efforts should be made to propose a 12-week treatment with peg-IFN-alpha2b for AHC, and to maximize peg-IFN dosage. Early treatment is associated with early disappearance of HCV RNA."
1690,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to define novel associations between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class 1 alleles and persistence or clearance of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in a white population. All individuals in the study were seropositive for anti-HCV antibodies. Viral status was determined by the Roche HCV Amplicor test. HLA-A, -B, -C allelic group profile was molecularly defined by reverse line probe hybridization. The strongest individual allelic group associations with persistent HCV infection were HLA A*11 (p = 0.044) and Cw*04 (p = 0.006). However, only the HLA C*04 association survived correction for multiple comparisons. Further analysis of alleles in linkage with HLA Cw*04 revealed that the haplotype HLA A*11, Cw*04 was present in 11 individuals, 10 of whom were viremic (p = 0.05). No gene dosage effect was observed. No association between HLA class 1 allelic groups and aviremia and virus load was evident in this white population. HLA B*44 is associated with low virus load in human immunodeficiency virus disease, but this association was not evident in this HCV-infected population. Novel HLA class 1 alleles associated with persistence of HCV have been identified."
13716,0.005,1.0000,"Injection drug use is the leading risk factor for infection with hepatitis C virus, and interferon (IFN) treatment in this context is associated with a poor rate of adherence. In this article, we review our experience with injection drug users with acute hepatitis C who are treated with pegylated IFN- alpha -2b for 12 weeks. Acute hepatitis C was diagnosed according to standardized criteria, and patients were treated with a median dosage of IFN- alpha -2b of 1.33 microg/kg per week. A sustained virological response was achieved in 17 (74%) of 23 patients. A sustained virological response was achieved in 14 (87%) of 16 patients treated with a dosage of >or=1.33 microg/kg per week and in 3 (43%) of 7 patients treated with a lower dosage. Sustained virological response was significantly associated only with a pegylated IFN- alpha -2b dosage >or=1.33 microg/kg per week (P=.022). A 12-week regimen of pegylated IFN to treat injection drug users with hepatitis C has a compliance that is much higher than that reported with a 24-week regimen. Adverse effects are minimal if patients are carefully selected."
15044,0.005,1.0000,"Understanding the biology of spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection could lead to improved strategies to prevent the sequelae associated with chronic HCV infection. Chronic infections with hepatitis virus are very common in China, but the factors associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV have not been adequately studied. We evaluated the spontaneous clearance of HCV among 1918 drug users and 1526 HCV-seropositive blood donors in Guangzhou, China. Among participants who were co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), 41.38% of drug users and 39.47% of blood donors had cleared their HCV infection without antiviral therapy compared to 9.41% of drug users and 16.73% of blood donors who were mono-infected with a single virus (P<.01). The proportion of subjects who had cleared their HCV infection was significantly greater in the co-infected subjects whose serum HBV DNA was greater than 2000IU/mL than those with lower levels. A multiple logistic regression analysis found female gender, IL28B rs8099917 TT genotype, HBV co-infection and blood donors (vs drug users) associated with increased spontaneous clearance of HCV infection. Although acute HCV infections are common in China, the incidence of chronic HCV may be reduced among the high prevalence of chronic HBV and IL28B genotypes associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV in Chinese populations."

4875,0.005,1.0000,"We conducted a study to assess the effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on humoral immunity. Fifty-five homosexual men and 19 heterosexual men had four- to six-week postimmunization antibody responses measured to trivalent influenza vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine. The homosexual men were divided into three groups: 20 asymptomatic HIV-seronegative men, 10 asymptomatic HIV-seropositive men, and 25 HIV-seropositive men with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy. Antibody responses to influenza antigens in the subgroups of homosexual men did not significantly differ from those of heterosexual controls. The IgG antibody responses to pneumococcal capsular types 9N and 18C in men with lymphadenopathy, and type 18C in HIV-seronegative homosexual men, were lower than those of heterosexual controls. Otherwise, responses to other ten capsular types showed no significant differences. There was no evidence of an immunosuppressive effect of vaccination on T-cell numbers, or deterioration of clinical status associated with vaccination. This study demonstrates that HIV-infected homosexual men, asymptomatic or with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, are able to mount appropriate antibody responses to two commonly used vaccines."
5018,0.005,1.0000,"The dietary intake of micronutrients and serum micronutrient status have been topics of concern in relation to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) progression. Most data, however, were collected prior to the introduction of protease inhibitors (PIs). We analyzed dietary intake and serum values of vitamin B(12), including the effect of PIs, in a cohort of persons with HIV infection. During intervals with no PI use, each 1 microg/day increase in B(12) intake was associated with a 1.06 pg/mL increase in serum B(12) levels. However, during intervals with PI use, each 1 microg/day increase in intake was associated with only a 0.12 increase in serum B(12) levels. Adequate serum B(12) levels (>350 pg/mL) cannot be assumed even in the presence of PIs, and dietary supplementation may not be adequate to significantly increase serum B(12) levels. Serum B(12) levels should be determined yearly in persons with HIV infection, regardless of whether they are receiving PI treatment."
3516,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is no longer a contraindication to transplantation. For HIV-infected patients, HIV-infected deceased donors (HIVDD) could attenuate the organ shortage and waitlist mortality. However, this practice would violate United States federal law. The goal of this study was to estimate the potential impact of legalizing transplantation of HIV-infected organs by quantifying the potential pool of HIVDD. Using Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) data, HIV-infected deaths compatible with donation were enumerated. Using HIV Research Network (HIVRN) data, CD4 count, plasma HIV-1 RNA level, AIDS-defining illnesses and causes of death were examined in potential HIVDD. Using UNOS data, evaluated donors who later demonstrated unanticipated HIV infections were studied. From NIS, a yearly average of 534 (range: 481-652) potential HIVDD were identified, with 63 (range: 39-90) kidney-only, 221 (range: 182-255) liver-only and 250 (range: 182-342) multiorgan donors. From HIVRN, a yearly average of 494 (range: 441-533) potential HIVDD were identified. Additionally, a yearly average of 20 (range: 11-34) donors with unanticipated HIV infection were identified from UNOS. Deceased HIV-infected patients represent a potential of approximately 500-600 donors per year for HIV-infected transplant candidates. In the current era of HIV management, a legal ban on the use of these organs seems unwarranted and likely harmful."
12968,0.005,1.0000,"The influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the clinical course of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is controversial. We followed a cohort of 64 homosexual men with persistent HBs antigenemia for a median of 24 months in the hepatitis clinic of a large urban public hospital. We divided the patients into three groups according to their immune status. Group 1 (n = 13) consisted of HIV-seropositive men with evidence of immunosuppression; group 2 (n = 17), HIV-positive patients without evidence of immunosuppression; and group 3 (n = 34), HIV-negative patients. We followed serum ALT and HBV DNA determinations. There was no difference in the demographic characteristics of the three groups. Group 1 had significantly lower levels of circulating T4 lymphocytes. We found no differences in the number and severity of episodes of HBV reactivation, serum ALT levels, or HBV DNA scores among the three groups. In each group, the percentage of patients with circulating HBV DNA was the same. We conclude that HIV infection apparently does not influence the markers of liver inflammation or HBV replication in homosexual men."
16333,0.005,1.0000,"We explored the possibility that neurologic and neuropsychological changes constitute the earliest detectable manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Without knowledge of HIV status, we assessed neurologic signs and symptoms and administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to 208 homosexual men, of whom 84 were HIV negative, 49 were HIV positive and asymptomatic, 29 were mildly symptomatic, and 46 had significant medical symptoms but not the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. There was no difference between the HIV-negative and HIV-positive men in the frequency of neurologic signs or of defective or borderline performance on any neuropsychological test. However, HIV-positive men performed slightly but significantly worse than HIV-negative men on tests of verbal memory, executive function, and language. Similar results were obtained when comparisons were limited to HIV-positive medically asymptomatic and HIV-negative men. There was no degradation of neurologic status or neuropsychological performance across stages of HIV severity, but neurologic and neuropsychological summary scores correlated with CD4/CD8 ratios in the HIV-positive group. Ratings of neurologic signs and symptoms correlated with neuropsychological summary scores in the HIV-positive group only. Cognitive complaints were more frequent in the HIV-positive men; they correlated with actual test performance in the HIV-positive but not HIV-negative men. The constellation of subjective and objective neuropsychological and neurologic findings suggests the possibility of a definable syndrome associated with HIV infection in asymptomatic individuals."
19905,0.005,1.0000,"Zoster is an important clinical problem for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV)-infected patients. Risk factors for zoster and trends in incidence in HIV-infected hemophiliacs and homosexual men (n=1218) were examined. From 1984 to 1997, 174 zoster cases were identified (average yearly incidence, 2.5%). Prior zoster episodes were associated with increased risk for a subsequent episode (relative risk [RR], 4.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.11-5.95). Among hemophiliacs, children and adolescents had the highest zoster risk, and zoster risk declined with age (RR, 0.80 per decade; 95% CI, 0.68-0.93). These findings suggest that HIV-infected persons do not produce or maintain adequate booster responses after varicella zoster virus exposure. Zoster risk was relatively constant when CD4 cell counts >200 cells/mm3 but increased steeply below this level. During the 14 years of follow-up, zoster incidence declined 9% per year. This trend occurred despite decreasing CD4 cell counts and was unexplained by zidovudine or acyclovir use."

Of 40 seropositive men, 38 (95%) were PCR-positive; one was PCR-indeterminate and one PCR-negative. None of 41 seronegative men who used only donor-screened, virus-inactivated coagulation factor products were PCR-positive. However, two of six who received noninactivated products were PCR-positive; one had low T-helper cell counts and died of unrelated causes and the other had seroconverted 11 mo later. PCR with a second primer pair also detected HIV-1 DNA in these two men. None of 25 seronegative female sex partners of seropositive men, including six men with AIDS and seven with AIDS-related symptoms, were PCR-positive. These data suggest that most seropositive hemophilic men are HIV-infected; whether some are infected with defective virus remains to be resolved as does the infection status of seropositive PCR-negative men. Identification of two seronegative PCR-positive men supports the possibility that HIV-1 DNA can be detected before seroconversion."

Three have died (one with normal, two with abnormal tests at baseline). To study the effect of antiviral treatment, another group of seven asymptomatic patients was included into a cross-over double-blind study with either eight weeks zidovudine or eight weeks placebo, separated by eight more weeks without treatment. Electrophysiological evaluation was also performed in a group of 15 patients before antiviral therapy with zidovudine or didanosine was started and again after a mean of three and 13 months treatment.

Changes in IBS-QoL from baseline over time (to week 24) were classified as: ""Improvement"" (> or =2-point positive change from baseline), ""No change"" (<2-point change), or ""Worsening"" (> or =2-point negative change). Data were collected on GI adverse events (AEs) and use of GI medications. Of the 599 patients with IBS-QoL-evaluable data through week 24, fewer patients in the ATV/RTV group than in the LPV/RTV group experienced grade 2-4 treatment-related GI AEs including diarrhea (3% versus 10%), nausea (5% versus 7%), and vomiting (<1% on both arms). Nearly three times as many patients receiving LPV/RTV used GI medications. ATV/RTV was associated with an increase in overall IBS-QoL scores and more patients receiving ATV/RTV than LPV/RTV experienced improvement in IBS-QoL through week 24. In contrast to LPV/RTV, ATV/RTV treatment was associated with earlier and more positive improvements in QoL scores across CD4 sub-groups. Differences in the health-related QoL profile between ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV may be important when selecting PI-based antiretroviral regimens."

The cost effectiveness of the ARV agent enfuvirtide has been shown to be comparable to that of other available HIV treatment strategies, based on Markov modeling. However, an evaluation of enfuvirtide treatment costs that considers the impact of virological and immunological responses to therapy may provide a more clinically meaningful perspective for primary HIV healthcare providers. The aim of this study was to assess the cost per unit change in efficacy (HIV RNA decreases and CD4 count increases) of three different ARV regimens for triple class-experienced HIV-1 infected patients using actual drug costs and data from randomised, controlled clinical trials."

FUO was defined by the endurance of a fever (temperature, > 38.2 degrees C) for at least 4 weeks before admission and the uncertainty of diagnosis after 3 days, despite appropriate investigation. Of 580 patients evaluated, 50 (8.2%) had FUO. Patients with FUO were at advanced stages of HIV infection (median CD4+ cell count, 71/mm3), and a vast majority (84%) had previously diagnosed AIDS. A cause of the fever was identified for 44 patients (88%), and infections accounted for 82% of all cases. Tuberculosis (42%), visceral leishmaniasis (14%), and disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection (14%) were the most frequent diagnoses. Examination of lymph node aspirates, bone marrow biopsy, and culture of clinical specimens for mycobacteria were the procedures with the highest diagnostic yield. Among 6 patients with fever of no identified etiology, 4 died while febrile, and fever was self-limited in the other 2 patients. FUO is common among patients with advanced HIV infection. Since a cause, usually infection, can be identified in most patients, long-lasting fever should not be attributed to HIV itself."

2533,0.005,1.0000,"The meaning of viral blips in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients treated with seemingly effective highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is still controversial and under investigation. Blips might represent low-level ongoing viral replication in the presence of drug or simply release of virions from the latent reservoir. Patients treated early during HIV-1 infection are more likely to have a lower total body viral burden, a homogenous viral population, and preserved HIV-1-specific immune responses. Consequently, viral blips may be less frequent in them than in patients treated during chronic infection. To test this hypothesis, we compared the occurrence of viral blips in 76 acutely infected patients (primary HIV infection [PHI] group) who started therapy within 6 months of the onset of symptoms with that in 47 patients who started HAART therapy during chronic infection (chronic HIV infection [CHI] group). Viral blip frequency was approximately twofold higher in CHI patients (0.122 +/- 0.12/viral load [VL] sample, mean +/- standard deviation) than in PHI patients (0.066 +/- 0.09/VL sample). However, in both groups, viral blip frequency did not increase with longer periods of observation. Also, no difference in viral blip frequency was observed between treatment subgroups, and the occurrence of a blip was not associated with a recent change in CD4(+) T-cell count. Finally, in PHI patients the VL set point was a significant predictor of blip frequency during treatment."

With the inclusion of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and the choice of delivery route this amounts to less than 2%. However ARV use during pregnancy has generated several questions regarding the adverse effects of the gestational and neonatal outcome. This study aims to analyze the risk factors for vertical transmission of HIV-1 seropositive pregnant women living in Rio Grande and the influence of the use of ARVs in pregnancy outcome. Among the 262 pregnant women studied the rate of vertical transmission of HIV was found to be 3.8%. Regarding the VT, there was a lower risk of transmission when antiretroviral drugs were used and prenatal care was conducted at the referral service. However, the use of ART did not influence the outcome of pregnancy. However, initiation of prenatal care after the first trimester had an influence on low birth weight, as well as performance of less than six visits increased the risk of prematurity. Therefore, the risk factors analyzed in this study appear to be related to the realization of inadequate pre-natal and maternal behavior. "

Therefore we investigated the endogenous IFN plasma levels in patients with asymptomatic HIV infection (CDC/WHO A1, n = 10) and patients with AIDS (CDC/WHO C3, n = 10). In AIDS plasma IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma levels are elevated (15.6 +/- 5.8 U/ml; 2.1 +/- 0.7 U/ml) compared to patients with an asymptomatic HIV infection (6.1 +/- 3.3 U/ml; 0.6 +/- 0.3 U/ml). The antipyrine clearance was significantly reduced in the group of AIDS patients (43.1 +/- 7.2 ml/min compared to 56.4 +/- 8.7 ml/min). In a second study with 11 patients in stage CDC/WHO A1/2 and CDC/ WHO B/C3 each, we studied the effect of a 14-day administration of ZDV on the endogenous plasma IFN levels and the CYP450 enzyme activity using the antipyrine pharmacokinetics as a parameter. We investigated the antipyrine clearance, clearance to metabolite and half-life by using HPLC. IFNs were measured by RIA or ELISA, respectively. In the first group no significant alterations of antipyrine kinetics or plasma IFN levels were observed after treatment with ZDV. In contrast to these results, we found a significant decrease in IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma (19.8 +/- 3.6 U/ml, 4.6 +/- 1.5 U/ml before; 7.9 +/- 2.6 U/ml, 1.9 +/- 1.3 U/ml after administration of ZDV), a decrease in antipyrine half-life, an elevation of the antipyrine clearance (49.8 +/- 15.7 ml/min, 57.3 +/- 13.7 ml/min) and an elevation of the clearances to metabolite."
1075,0.005,1.0000,"The ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase plays a central role in responses to various forms of DNA damage and has been suggested to facilitate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration. Here, we describe a series of experiences that indicate that ATM can enhance HIV-1 replication by stimulating the action of the Rev viral posttranscriptional regulator. The Rev-dependent stimulation of viral late gene expression was observed with ATM-overexpressing cells, a result confirmed with a Rev-dependent reporter construct. Both parameters were also enhanced upon treatment of HeLa cells with caffeine, a xanthine that, in this cellular context, stimulates ATM activity. As well, decreased levels of virions with reduced infectivity were released by ATM knockdown cells. Notably, ATM overexpression did not stimulate the HIV-1 late gene expression within the context of Rev-independent constructs or the Rex-dependent production of capsid from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 proviral constructs. Altogether, these results indicate that ATM can positively influence HIV-1 Rev function."
4576,0.005,1.0000,"JC virus (JCV) is the aetiological agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a fatal, demyelinating disease of the brain affecting people with AIDS. Although immunosuppression is involved in infection of the brain by JCV, a direct influence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has also been established. The Tat protein of HIV-1 has been implicated in activation of the cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in HIV-1-infected cells and in stimulating JCV gene transcription and DNA replication in oligodendroglia, the primary central nervous system cell type infected by JCV in PML. This study demonstrated that Tat can cooperate with SMAD proteins, the intracellular effectors of TGF-beta, at the JCV DNA control region (CR) to stimulate JCV gene transcription. Tat stimulated JCV early gene transcription in KG-1 oligodendroglial cells when expressed via transfection or added exogenously. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, it was shown that exogenous Tat enhanced binding of SMAD2, -3 and -4 and their binding partner Fast1 to the JCV CR in living cells. When SMAD2, -3 and -4 were expressed together, Tat, expressed from plasmid pTat, stimulated transcription from both early and late gene promoters, with the early promoter exhibiting stimulation of >100-fold. Tat, SMAD4 and JCV large T-antigen were all visualized in oligodendroglial cells at the border of an active PML lesion in the cerebral frontal lobe. These results revealed a positive reinforcement system in which the SMAD mediators of the TGF-beta system act cooperatively with Tat to stimulate JCV gene transcription."
8386,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef protein exerts several effects, both on infected cells and as a virion protein, which work together to enhance viral replication. One of these activities is the ability to enhance infectivity and the formation of proviral DNA. The mechanism of this enhancement remains incompletely understood. We show that virions with nef deleted can be restored to wild-type infectivity by stimulating intravirion reverse transcription. Particle composition and measures of reverse transcriptase activity remain the same for Nef(+) and Nef(-) virions both before and after natural endogenous reverse transcription (NERT) treatment. The effect of NERT treatment on virions pseudotyped with murine leukemia virus envelope protein was similar to that on particles pseudotyped with HIV-1 envelope protein. However, virions pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G envelope protein showed no influence of Nef on NERT enhancement of infectivity. These observations suggest that Nef may function at a level prior to reverse transcription. Since NERT treatment results in partial disassembly of the viral core, we speculate that Nef may function at the level of core particle disassembly."
21,0.005,1.0000,"Cytokines and beta-chemokines play an important role in the complex interaction between HIV-1 and the immune system. We studied platelet-free plasma (PFP) levels and ex vivo production of cytokines and beta-chemokines at different HIV disease stages and the influence of potent protease inhibitor therapy on their production in late-stage patients. Mitogen-induced production of MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES by PBMCs was higher in HIV-infected patients than in HIV-seronegative controls. Patients with late-stage HIV infection (CD4+ cells <50/microl) showed a higher production of MIP-1alpha and RANTES and lower plasma levels of IL-2 compared with HIV-positive patients at the intermediate stage (CD4+ cells >150/microl). Pretreatment RANTES production correlated negatively with CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts; also, MIP-1alpha production was inversely correlated with CD4+ cell counts. Among patients with a CD4+ cell count <50/microl, RANTES production before protease inhibitor treatment was inversely correlated with viral load. Late-stage patients with IL-2 production higher than 50 pg/ml before treatment showed a more impressive increase in CD4+ cell counts after protease inhibitor therapy. The production of MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, RANTES, and IFN-gamma was markedly reduced at 8 weeks and partially restored at 24 weeks after beginning protease inhibitor therapy. PFP levels of RANTES showed a concurrent decrease. Patients with more advanced HIV infection show a higher production of inflammatory cytokines, which is reduced by protease inhibitor therapy. Residual late-stage IL-2 producers may represent a subset of patients with a higher potential for immunologic reconstitution."
14411,0.005,1.0000,"To better understand the viral and host factors involved in the establishment of persistent productive infection by primate lentiviruses, we varied the time of initiation and duration of postinoculation antiretroviral treatment with tenofovir (9-[2-(R)-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine) while performing intensive virologic and immunologic monitoring in rhesus macaques, inoculated intravenously with simian immunodeficiency virus SIVsmE660. Postinoculation treatment did not block the initial infection, but we identified treatment regimens that prevented the establishment of persistent productive infection, as judged by the absence of measurable plasma viremia following drug discontinuation. While immune responses were heterogeneous, animals in which treatment resulted in prevention of persistent productive infection showed a higher frequency and higher levels of SIV-specific lymphocyte proliferative responses during the treatment period compared to control animals, despite the absence of either detectable plasma viremia or seroconversion. Animals protected from the initial establishment of persistent productive infection were also relatively or completely protected from subsequent homologous rechallenge. Even postinoculation treatment regimens that did not prevent establishment of persistent infection resulted in downmodulation of the level of plasma viremia following treatment cessation, compared to the viremia seen in untreated control animals, animals treated with regimens known to be ineffective, or the cumulative experience with the natural history of plasma viremia following infection with SIVsmE660. The results suggest that the host may be able to effectively control SIV infection if the initial exposure occurs under favorable conditions of low viral burden and in the absence of ongoing high level cytopathic infection of responding cells. These findings may be particularly important in relation to prospects for control of primate lentiviruses in the settings of both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination for prevention of AIDS."
6049,0.005,1.0000,"A longitudinal study was conducted to investigate the association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, history of major depressive disorder (MDD), and persistent or recurrent MDD among intravenous drug users. Psychiatric disorders were assessed in a sample of HIV-positive (HIV+) and HIV-negative (HIV-) intravenous drug users every 6 months for 3 years. Results indicated that HIV status and baseline MDD independently predicted persistent or recurrent episodes of MDD after gender, drug use, ethnicity, income, and the presence other psychiatric disorders were controlled statistically. Among HIV+ intravenous drug users with baseline MDD, 90% experienced at least one subsequent episode of MDD and 47% experienced at least three subsequent episodes of MDD. However, less than 40% of intravenous drug users with current MDD received treatment for emotional problems. These findings indicate that intravenous drug users with HIV infection and a history of MDD are at considerable risk for future episodes of MDD or recurrent MDD, and that increased provision of treatment for intravenous drug users with MDD may be necessary."

To determine the predictive value of persistent diarrhea for human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection, 128 consecutive patients presenting at Mama Yemo Hospital with persistent diarrhea were tested for the presence of HIV antibodies. One-hundred seven (84%) of the 128 patients with diarrhea lasting at least 1 month were found to be HIV seropositive. HIV seropositive patients with persistent diarrhea more often had a generalized papular pruritic eruption (p = 0.02), a genital herpes simplex infection (p = 0.05), a history of herpes zoster (p = 0.08), and infection with cryptosporidia (p = 0.006) than HIV seronegative patients with persistent diarrhea. Bacterial enteric pathogens were found in 5 (7%) of the 76 seropositive and in none of the 14 seronegative patients in whom stool cultures were performed. Presently persistent diarrhea in adults in central Africa is strongly associated with HIV infection, but the pathophysiological mechanisms causing this diarrhea remain unclear."

Predictors for persistent diarrhea included high HIV RNA viral load and no initiation of protease inhibitor therapy.
7737,0.005,1.0000,"In 1984 a large prospective study of gay and bisexual men was begun to elucidate the natural history of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. At two successive semiannual examinations, clinical or hematologic abnormalities were found up to 13 times more often among HIV-seropositive men (n = 1611) than HIV-seronegative men (n = 2646). More than 30% of the seropositive participants had persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, independent of T-helper lymphocyte (CD4) counts and most other signs and symptoms. Other clinical manifestations such as thrush, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, fever, and fatigue occurred with only slightly reduced CD4 counts (400 to 700/mm3) and appeared to increase exponentially with progressively lower counts. A simple systematically derived clinical index using these manifestations identified more than 70% of the seropositive men with significant T-helper cell depletion. This kind of clinical index may be useful for assessing groups of HIV-infected persons, especially those whose T-lymphocyte numbers and function cannot be readily measured."

1426,0.005,1.0000,"The authors conducted a population-based study to attempt to estimate the effect of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seropositivity on Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test scores in otherwise healthy individuals with early HIV-1 infection. The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is a 10-test written multiple aptitude battery administered to all civilian applicants for military enlistment prior to serologic screening for HIV-1 antibodies. A total of 975,489 induction testing records containing both Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery and HIV-1 results from October 1985 through March 1987 were examined. An analysis data set (n = 7,698) was constructed by choosing five controls for each of the 1,283 HIV-1-positive cases, matched on five-digit ZIP code, and a multiple linear regression analysis was performed to control for demographic and other factors that might influence test scores. Years of education was the strongest predictor of test scores, raising an applicant's score on a composite test nearly 0.16 standard deviation per year. The HIV-1-positive effect on the composite score was -0.09 standard deviation (99% confidence interval -0.17 to -0.02). Separate regressions on each component test within the battery showed HIV-1 effects between -0.39 and +0.06 standard deviation. The two Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery component tests felt a priori to be the most sensitive to HIV-1-positive status showed the least decrease with seropositivity. Much of the variability in test scores was not predicted by either HIV-1 serostatus or the demographic and other factors included in the model. There appeared to be little evidence of a strong HIV-1 effect."
7830,0.005,1.0000,"This paper answers the questions: who is and is not tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies, why, where are they tested, and what do they find difficult about the testing process? The data came from two samples of sexually active heterosexual, bisexual and gay men in Perth (N = 545). Bisexual and gay men were much more likely to be tested than heterosexual men, although the commonest reason for testing for all three groups was risky sex. The three groups differed on reasons for not having the HIV antibody test: heterosexual men most commonly claimed that they were not at risk; bisexual men explained that they had been meaning to go but kept putting it off; and gay men primarily feared a positive test result and lacked trust in the confidential treatment of results. Gay men were more likely to trust their regular doctors than were heterosexual and bisexual men who had more trust in state health clinics. Waiting for test results was the most difficult part of the testing process for all respondents. Few respondents agreed that employers and the police should be notified by a doctor of an antibody-positive test result; nearly all agreed that those who had contracted HIV should be notified; notification of surgeons received moderate support. Knowing one's HIV infection status appears to be strongly associated with safer sex practices, and therefore the HIV antibody test could be promoted as part of a preventive health care program."
11622,0.005,1.0000,"Recent studies have documented dramatic decreases in opportunistic infections, hospitalizations, and mortality among HIV-infected persons, owing primarily to the advent of highly active antiretroviral medications. Unfortunately, not all segments of the population living with HIV benefit equally from treatment. In San Francisco, only about 30% of the HIV-infected urban poor take combination highly active antiretroviral medications, as compared with 88% of HIV-infected gay men. Practitioners who care for the urban poor are reluctant to prescribe these medications, fearing inadequate or inconsistent adherence to the complicated medical regimen. Persons typically must take 2 to 15 pills at a time, 2 to 3 times a day. Some of the medications require refrigeration, which may not be available to the homeless poor. Most homeless persons do not have food available to them on a consistent schedule. Therefore, they may have difficulty adhering to instructions to take medications only on an empty stomach or with food. Lack of a safe place to store medications may be an issue for some. In addition, many urban poor live with drug, alcohol, or mental health problems, which can interfere with taking medications as prescribed. Inconsistent adherence to medication regimens has serious consequences. Patients do not benefit fully from treatments, and they will become resistant to the medications in their regimen as well as to other medications in the same classes as those in their regimen. Development of resistance has implications for the broader public health, because inadvertent transmission of multidrug-resistant strains of HIV has been demonstrated. Concern that the urban poor will not adhere to highly active antiretroviral medication regimens has led to debate on the role of clinicians and public health officials in determining who can comply with these regimens. Rather than define the characteristics that would predict adherence to these regimens, the San Francisco Department of Public Health created a program to support adherence among those who may have the greatest difficulty complying with complicated highly active antiretroviral medication regimens. The program, dubbed the Action Point Adherence Project, was conceived through a community planning process in preparation for a city-wide summit on HIV/AIDS that took place in January 1998. Action Point is funded by the city and the county of San Francisco. Now in its 10th month, the program continues to show promising evidence of improving clients' biological and social indicators."

The T-helper/T-suppressor lymphocyte ratios of HIV antibody-negative homosexual male gay bar patrons were slightly depressed (mean = 1.31 +/- 0.54) compared with those of heterosexual controls (mean = 1.79 +/- 0.32). In addition to other recognized factors, preexisting humoral as well as cell-mediated immune deficits before infection with HIV may help to explain the prevalence of and morbidity and mortality associated with P. carinii pneumonitis in AIDS patients."
4302,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to report prevalence rates of adherence by HIV-seropositive individuals to medical recommendations for the treatment of HIV infection, a behavioral pattern referred to as AIDS secondary prevention. We report cross-sectional data (n = 2,593) from two household-based and two bar-based samples of gay/bisexual men, gathered in 1992 in Tucson, Arizona, and Portland, Oregon. The main outcome variables were prevalence of HIV antibody testing and adherence to recommended secondary prevention behaviors to prevent onset of AIDS symptoms. Approximately one-third of the gay/bisexual men in these samples do not know their current HIV status. Of the gay/bisexual men who do know that they are HIV-seropositive, approximately three-fourths adhere to each of the secondary prevention recommendations, as appropriate to their stage of disease progression. In a multivariate logistic model, three variables distinguished between HIV-seropositive men who did and did not adhere: perceived antiviral treatment norms (OR = 1.4, CI = 1.1-1.7), perceived efficacy of secondary prevention treatments (OR = 1.4, CI = 1.1-1.7), and quality of the relationship with one's health-care provider (OR = 2.5, CI = 1.6-4.0). These findings indicate that efforts to support AIDS secondary prevention behaviors can occur not only through health education to change the perceptions of at-risk communities about the options available to delay the onset of opportunistic infections among HIV-seropositive individuals but also by enhancing effective doctor/patient communication."

Standardized personal interviews using a structured questionnaire were conducted to assess sociodemographic features and prison setting characteristics, clinical variables, social support and drug consumption. A simplified four-item questionnaire for self-reported adherence was used. A total of 24.3% were non-adherent. Predictors of non-adherence in the multivariate analysis included poor or lack of ability to follow the prescribed treatment regimen, no visits in a month, anxious and/or depressed mood, difficulty in taking medication, receiving methadone treatment, cannabis consumption and robbery as the reason for imprisonment. Adherence to antiretroviral therapy was higher than in the wider community. However, other variables related to the correctional setting, such as assignments within the facility, adaptability of the prison system to authorize the cell being opened in the event of missed medication, or legal situation had no effect on adherence for inmates with HIV disease."

Thirty-one patients who received HAART after developing VL were included in a retrospective cohort study. Ten of them received secondary chemoprophylaxis and the rest did not. Eight (38%) patients without secondary chemoprophylaxis showed a VL relapse.

The recently reported results of AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 076 demonstrated that ZDV administered to a selected group of HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants can reduce the risk for perinatal HIV transmission by approximately two-thirds. The regimen used in this trial included antenatal oral administration of ZDV beginning at 14-34 weeks of gestation and continuing throughout pregnancy, followed by intrapartum intravenous ZDV and postnatal oral administration of ZDV to the infant for 6 weeks after delivery. This document summarizes the results of the trial, discusses limitations in the interpretation of the results, reviews the potential long-term adverse effects of this ZDV regimen for infants and women, and provides recommendations for the use of ZDV to reduce perinatal transmission and for medical monitoring of pregnant women and infants receiving this therapy. Because the clinical status of many HIV-infected women may differ from that of the women in this trial, the recommendations should be tailored to each woman's clinical situation. The potential benefits, unknown long-term effects, and gaps in knowledge about her specific clinical situation must be discussed with the woman. This information is intended to provide a basis for discussion between the woman and her healthcare provider so that the woman can weigh the risks and benefits of such therapy and make informed decisions about her treatment."

Little is known, however, about the influence of socioeconomic as well as caregivers' health beliefs on both adherence and virologic outcome of pediatric antiretroviral treatment in these settings. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 57 caregiver-child dyads at a public hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. Adherence was electronically monitored over three months, viral loads were available pre- and post-study. Caregivers answered questionnaires on their socioeconomic situation, attitudes toward and knowledge about treatment, and quality of life. Young children with a mean age of 51 months (SD 25.6) were investigated, and all were cared for by female caregivers. Mean adherence was 81%, and 67% of children achieved virologic suppression (VS). Household income, educational status, and child characteristics were not significantly correlated with adherence. Disclosure of both the child's and the caregiver's HIV status was linked to achieving VS and was a significant predictor for VS. A model including child's health status, caregiver's language skills, caregiver's disclosure, and perceived stigmatization could explain 95% of the variance in VS. Adherence and VS were not associated with socioeconomic factors in this population. Social factors such as stigmatization, fear of disclosure, and caregivers' attitudes toward the health-care system influenced VS but not adherence."

14656,0.005,1.0000,"The prerequisite for an 'undetectable' HIV viral load has restricted access to transplantation for HIV-infected kidney recipients. However, HCV-infected recipients, owing to the historic limitations of HCV therapy in patients with renal disease, are commonly viremic at transplant and have universal access. To compare the effect of HIV, HCV, and HIV/HCV coinfection on kidney transplant patient and allograft outcomes, we performed a retrospective study of kidney recipients transplanted from January 1996 through December 2013. In multivariable analysis, patient (hazard ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.66-1.24) and allograft survival (0.60, 40-0.88) in 492 HIV patients did not differ significantly from the 117,791 patient-uninfected reference group. This was superior to outcomes in both the 5605 patient HCV group for death (1.44, 1.33-1.56) and graft loss (1.43, 1.31-1.56), as well as the 147 patient HIV/HCV coinfected group for death (2.26, 1.45-3.52) and graft loss (2.59, 1.60-4.19). HIV infection did not adversely affect recipient or allograft survival and was associated with superior outcomes compared with both HCV infection and HIV/HCV coinfection in this population. Thus, pretransplant viral eradication and/or immediate posttransplant eradication should be studied as potential strategies to improve posttransplant outcomes in HCV-infected kidney recipients. "
1196,0.005,1.0000,"An acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) murine model was developed to study the pathogenic and protective mechanisms against viruses that replicate in cells of the human immune system. The model allowed efficient replication of lymphotropic, macrophage and amphitropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and measles virus (MV). Cytopathic lymphotropic strains of HIV-1 and a wild-type MV strain replicated in a 'burst'-like manner, whereas a non-cytopathic lymphotropic HIV-1 strain and all macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains caused persistent infection of the graft. The replication kinetics of infection with these viruses were highly reproducible and were very similar to those observed in natural infection of humans. Infection with these viruses, with the exception of HIV-1SF2, led to a delay [corrected] and abrogation of the GvHD, indicating a direct immunosuppressive effect. Interestingly, infection with the lymphotropic HIV-1SF2 strain was rapidly and spontaneously abrogated. The model was also shown to be suitable for the evaluation of passive immunization strategies. Administration of a combination of antibodies against the HIV-1 V3 loop and the HIV-1 CD4 binding sites prevented subsequent infection with HIV-1IIIB. In contrast, administration of CD4 binding site specific human monoclonal antibody at a concentration that would neutralize the virus in vitro enhanced in vivo infection with HIV-1IIIB. The model also allowed evaluation of in vivo immunization studies. Immunization with a live attenuated measles vaccine resulted in protection from a wild-type MV challenge, whereas immunization with a subunit candidate vaccine appeared to give partial protection."
