640,0.04,8.0000,"Although China's government is rapidly expanding access to antiretroviral therapy, little is known about barriers to adherence among Chinese HIV-infected patients, particularly among injection drug users. To better understand barriers to antiretroviral treatment adherence, we conducted a qualitative research study, using both focus group and key informant methods, among 36 HIV-positive men and women in Dali, in southwestern China. All interviews utilized semi-structured question guides and were conducted in Mandarin, audio-recorded and translated into English for analysis. The most commonly cited adherence challenges were stigma, including secondary stigma experienced by family members; mental health issues; and economic concerns, particularly related to finding and maintaining employment. Distinctive gender differences emerged, partly due to previous heroin use among male respondents. Optimizing adherence may require that antiretroviral therapy programs be linked to other services, including drug addiction treatment, mental health services and vocational treatment and support. HIV care and service providers and policy makers in China responsible for HIV treatment should be aware of these important barriers to adherence."
14248,0.035,7.0000,"Although weight loss associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is multifactorial in its pathogenesis, it has been speculated that hypogonadism, a common occurrence in HIV disease, contributes to depletion of lean tissue and muscle dysfunction. We, therefore, examined the effects of testosterone replacement by means of Androderm, a permeation-enhanced, nongenital transdermal system, on lean body mass, body weight, muscle strength, health-related quality of life, and HIV-disease markers. We randomly assigned 41 HIV-infected, ambulatory men, 18-60 yr of age, with serum testosterone levels below 400 ng/dL, to 1 of 2 treatment groups: group I, two placebo patches (n = 21); or group II, two testosterone patches designed to release 5 mg testosterone over 24 h. Eighteen men in the placebo group and 14 men in the testosterone group completed the 12-week treatment. Serum total and free testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels increased, and LH and FSH levels decreased in the testosterone-treated, but not in the placebo-treated, men. Lean body mass and fat-free mass, measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, increased significantly in men receiving testosterone patches [change in lean body mass, +1.345 +/- 0.533 kg (P = 0.02 compared to no change); change in fat-free mass, +1.364 +/- 0.525 kg (P = 0.02 compared to no change)], but did not change in the placebo group [change in lean body mass, 0.189 +/- 0.470 kg (P = NS compared to no change); change in fat-free mass, 0.186 +/- 0.470 kg (P = NS compared to no change)]. However, there was no significant difference between the 2 treatment groups in the change in lean body mass. The change in lean body mass during treatment was moderately correlated with the increment in serum testosterone levels (r = 0.41; P = 0.02). The testosterone-treated men experienced a greater decrease in fat mass than those receiving placebo patches (P = 0.04). There was no significant change in body weight in either treatment group. Changes in overall quality of life scores did not correlate with testosterone treatment; however, in the subcategory of role limitation due to emotional problems, the men in the testosterone group improved an average of 43 points of a 0-100 possible score, whereas those in the placebo group did not change. Red cell count increased in the testosterone group (change in red cell count, +0.1 +/- 0.1 10(12)/L) but decreased in the placebo group (change in red cell count, -0.2 +/- 0.1 10(12)/L). CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts and plasma HIV copy number did not significantly change during treatment. Serum prostate-specific antigen and plasma lipid levels did not change in either treatment group. Testosterone replacement in HIV-infected men with low testosterone levels is safe and is associated with a 1.35-kg gain in lean body mass, a significantly greater reduction in fat mass than that achieved with placebo treatment, an increased red cell count, and an improvement in role limitation due to emotional problems. Further studies are needed to assess whether testosterone supplementation can produce clinically meaningful changes in muscle function and disease outcome in HIV-infected men."
12251,0.03,6.0000,"Sexual contact is the major mode of HIV transmission. Increased sexual risk taking has been described in HIV-infected individuals receiving potent antiretroviral therapy. A new questionnaire on sexual behavior was introduced into the Swiss HIV Cohort Study on April 1, 2000. We evaluated sexual behavior in all individuals who completed the questionnaire for the first time within 1 year after its introduction. Our primary hypothesis was that self-reported unsafe sexual behavior would be more prevalent among individuals with optimal viral suppression. On April 1, 2000, 4948 individuals were registered in the study, and 4723 (95%) completed the questionnaire. Of these individuals, 12% reported unsafe sex, 78% received antiretroviral therapy, and 25% had optimal viral suppression (HIV RNA level always <50 copies/mL during the preceding 12 months). During the preceding 6 months, 55% of individuals had stable and 19% had occasional partners, and 6% had both types of partners. Sexual intercourse was reported by 82% of individuals with stable and 87% of individuals with occasional partners, and of those reporting sexual intercourse in each group, 76% and 86%, respectively, said that they always used condoms. After adjustment for covariates, reported unsafe sex was not associated with optimal viral suppression (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.33) or antiretroviral therapy (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.07), but it was associated with gender, age, ethnicity, HIV transmission group, HIV status of partner, having occasional partners, and living alone. There is no evidence that self-reported unsafe sexual behavior is more prevalent among HIV-infected individuals with optimal viral suppression. However, unsafe sex is associated with other factors."
11470,0.03,6.0000,"Alcohol use among HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals is associated with decreased adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and consequently poorer HIV treatment outcomes. This study examined the independent association of individual and partner-level alcohol use with HIV disease management among men who have sex with men (MSM) in primary partnerships. In total, 356 HIV+ MSM and their male primary partners completed a baseline visit for a longitudinal study examining the role of couple-level factors in HIV treatment. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was administered to assess the individual and the partner-level alcohol use. Primary outcome variables included self-reported ART adherence, ART adherence self-efficacy, and HIV viral load. Results demonstrated that abstainers, compared to hazardous drinkers, had higher self-efficacy to integrate and persevere in HIV treatment and a lower odds of having a detectable viral load. Participants with a partner-abstainer, versus a partner-hazardous drinker, had less self-efficacy to persevere in HIV treatment, a lower odds of 100% three-day adherence and a higher viral load. Together, these findings suggest that assessment and treatment of both the patient's and the patient's primary partner's pattern of alcohol consumption is warranted when attempting to optimize HIV care among MSM."
8437,0.025,5.0000,"Quality of life (QoL) changes among 56 adult patients living with HIV/AID (PHA) were assessed following two years of care in which most had received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The sample was stratified by initial disease stage; subjects were classified 'asymptomatic' if they had no HIV-related constitutional symptoms, 'symptomatic' if they had at least one symptom, and 'AIDS' if symptomatic with a history of opportunistic infections and/or CD4 count less than 200 cells/ micro L. For the overall group, changes in mean QoL (Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form-36 [SF-36]) ratings were non-significant, irrespective of initial disease stage or prior HAART exposure. Although overall there were health status improvements over the two-year period, clinical changes were generally unrelated to changes in QoL ratings. Patients with better immunologic/virologic outcomes showed slight improvements in mean QoL ratings, while those with poorer clinical outcomes showed slight deterioration. These within-group changes over time were statistically non-significant. The corresponding between-group differences in changes in SF-36 social and psychological dimensions were significant. Statistically significant differences among the three disease stage groups on a number of subscales at baseline (Physical Function, Body Pain, Vitality, Role Limitations due to Physical Problems) became non-significant (i.e. nullified) at follow-up. Significant increases in mean number of symptoms for the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups were not associated with two-year changes in QoL ratings. Overall, wellbeing was moderately stable over the two-year follow-up period, although somewhat affected by symptom changes and immunologic/virologic outcome. The study results contrast with pre-HAART longitudinal research, in which deterioration in all areas of QoL occurred."
1953,0.025,5.0000,"The role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) function and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in HIV-related atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unclear. Both glycation and oxidation (HDLox) are major modifications of HDL that can alter its composition and function. Therefore, we explored the longitudinal association of HDLox with progression of glycation, as evaluated by measurement of circulating forms of receptor for AGE that predict morbidity (soluble Receptors for Advanced Glycation Endproducts [sRAGE], endogenous secretory Receptors for Advanced Glycation Endproducts [esRAGE]), in people with HIV-1 (PWH; HIV-1) and uninfected (HIV-1) individuals.We retrospectively assessed if levels of plasma sRAGE and esRAGE and HDL function (reduced antioxidant function is associated with increased HDL lipid hydroperoxide content; HDLox) in a subset of participants (n = 80) from a prospective 3-year study (AIDS Clinical Trials Group A5078). Primary outcomes were baseline and yearly rates of change over 96 of 144 weeks (Δ) in HDLox in HIV-1 versus uninfected HIV-1 controls (noted as HIV-1).Higher baseline levels of sRAGE in PWH on effective anti-retroviral therapy and with low CVD risk, but not in HIV-1 persons, were independently associated with higher HDLox. EsRAGE, but not sRAGE, had consistent inverse relationships with ΔHDLox in both HIV-1 and HIV-1 persons at baseline. In HIV-1 but not in HIV-1 persons, ΔHDLox had positive and inverse relationships with ΔRAGE and ΔesRAGE, respectively.Glycation and oxidation of HDL may contribute to impaired HDL function present in PWH."
3826,0.025,5.0000,"We report a 46-year-old man who has sex with men (MSM) patient, of Scottish descent, who had no history of arterial hypertension, diabetes, or illicit drug use, was hepatitis C virus (HCV) negative but underwent right nephrectomy for urothelial tumor in 2006. Before starting antiretroviral therapy, he had a CD4 cell count of 316/mm(3) and plasma HIV RNA level was 1,020,537 copies per milliliter. He developed acute renal failure only 2 weeks after introduction of tenofovir-based antiretroviral therapy and then required 3 months of hemodialysis. After the end of hemodialysis, antiviral therapy was resumed with abacavir (300 mg×2/day), lamivudine (300 mg every day), and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily). Renal biopsy revealed severe and diffuse toxic acute tubular necrosis Two years after tenofovir discontinuation, the patient's renal function remained subnormal. Although severe renal toxicity due to tenofovir is rare, patients receiving tenofovir must be monitored closely for renal dysfunction especially during the first weeks of tenofovir therapy."
1651,0.02,4.0000,"In the recent scale-up of antiretroviral treatment, gender differences in access to treatment have been reported. In Thailand, as the HIV epidemic became more generalised, there has been a shift from men being disproportionately affected to increased vulnerability of women. In 2007, the Living with Antiretrovirals (LIWA-ANRS 12141) study investigated the gender distribution of all adult patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (N=513 patients) in four community hospitals in northern Thailand and factors influencing the disparities observed. From this retrospective life-event history survey, we found that proportionately more women (53%) were receiving antiretroviral therapy than men, an unexpected result for a country with a higher proportion of infections among men. They were more likely to initiate treatment within one year of diagnosis and were at a more advanced stage of the disease compared to women. This gender distribution is partly explained by the evolving dynamics of the HIV epidemic, initial prioritization of mothers for treatment and earlier access to HIV testing for women. These issues are also entangled with gender differences in the reasons and timing to HIV testing at the individual level. This study found that the majority of men underwent HIV testing for health reasons while the majority of women were tested following family events such as a spouse/child death or during pregnancy. Further qualitative research on gender specific barriers to HIV testing and care, such as perceived low risk of infection, poor access to medical care, lack of social support, actual or anticipated HIV/AIDS-related stigma would provide greater insight. In the meantime, urgent efforts are needed to increase access to voluntary counselling and testing inside and outside the family setting with targeted interventions for men."
2148,0.02,4.0000,"In this multicenter study, we investigated the prognostic factors that influence the risk of death in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Clinical and laboratory indices obtained from 161 HIV-seropositive patients who underwent a detailed morphologic and immunophenotypic evaluation of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood cell populations were retrospectively analyzed. In 155 patients, death occurred within the 48-mo follow-up (mean follow-up: 14.8 mo; range: 1 to 48 mo). In the univariate analysis, the patient's age (> 30 yr), HIV disease status, HIV transmission category, number of opportunistic pathogens isolated from the BAL, percentage of BAL neutrophils, and low number of BAL CD4 T cells were predictive of increased mortality. In contrast, the presence of an alveolitis or an increase in the numbers of alveolar macrophages and CD3 T cells was associated with a decreased mortality. In the multivariate analysis, significant independent predictors were age, risk factor for HIV, and presence of an alveolitis. Furthermore, patients with a low number of BAL CD4 T cells had a particularly poor prognosis while the CD4 T-cell count in the peripheral blood (< 50 cells/mm3 in the majority of our patients) had a negligible effect on predicting survival. Our findings suggest the clinical utility of BAL analysis in patients infected with HIV."
13347,0.02,4.0000,"With the advent of potent combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), there has been a reduction in the incidence of wasting. However, few studies have investigated specific body composition changes associated with these treatments. This study aimed to investigate longitudinally the association of increasingly potent ART with changes in body cell mass and wasting utilizing bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA). In this longitudinal cohort study, 159 HIV-positive men were assessed semiannually from 1995 to 1997 for body composition utilizing BIA, CD4 lymphocyte count, HIV viral load, medical and depressive symptoms. Wasting was defined as body cell mass/height below the 90th percentile based on HIV positive norms. ART potency at each visit was scored utilizing published clinical guidelines, ranging from 1 (0-1 antiretrovirals) to 5 (3 or more antiretrovirals including a potent protease inhibitor). Viral resistance testing was not used. The mixed-effects model and the generalized estimating equations approaches were used to determine longitudinal correlates of body cell mass and of wasting, respectively. Over the 2 years of follow-up, potent combination ART use increased from 6% to 79%. Concurrently, a significant increase in mean body cell mass and a reduction in prevalence of wasting were seen, while total body weight, fat mass, and total body water did not change. Increasingly potent ART was associated with significant increases in body cell mass and reduction in wasting. Other significant correlates of increased body cell mass included higher CD4 count and decreased severity of HIV-related symptoms, fatigue and depression. The current study found that higher potency ART taken for relatively short term (2 years) was associated with an increase in body cell mass and a reduction in wasting and that these changes were associated with both medical (CD4, HIV symptoms) and behavioral (fatigue, depression) improvements. One caveat is this study did not distinguish among types of potent ART regimens. Given only some antiretrovirals appear linked to many body composition changes, regardless of their effect on viral load, it may be the type of regimen used that accounted for the relationship seen between viral load and body composition changes."
3012,0.02,4.0000,"This article describes the psychological distress experienced by family members living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Survey data were collected from 133 individuals, (47 parents, 53 siblings, 33 adult family members who have HIV/AIDS) representing 80 families. In-depth interview and observational data were collected from a subset of the sample. The physical and psychological health of individual family members was assessed by the 53-item Brief Symptom Inventory. Parents, siblings, and people living with AIDS (PWAs) reported higher levels of overall distress and scored higher on symptom dimensions and clinically discrete symptoms than normative comparison groups. Implications of these findings for research, clinical practice, and health and social service policy are identified and discussed."
11097,0.02,4.0000,"The advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 1996 resulted in fewer patients experiencing clinical events, so that some prognostic analyses of individual cohort studies of human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals had low statistical power. Because of this, the Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration (ART-CC) of HIV cohort studies in Europe and North America was established in 2000, with the aim of studying the prognosis for clinical events in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the mortality of adult patients treated for HIV-1 infection. In 2002, the ART-CC collected data on more than 12,000 patients in 13 cohorts who had begun combination ART between 1995 and 2001. Subsequent updates took place in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010. The ART-CC data base now includes data on more than 70,000 patients participating in 19 cohorts who began treatment before the end of 2009. Data are collected on patient demographics (e.g. sex, age, assumed transmission group, race/ethnicity, geographical origin), HIV biomarkers (e.g. CD4 cell count, plasma viral load of HIV-1), ART regimen, dates and types of AIDS events, and dates and causes of death. In recent years, additional data on co-infections such as hepatitis C; risk factors such as smoking, alcohol and drug use; non-HIV biomarkers such as haemoglobin and liver enzymes; and adherence to ART have been collected whenever available. The data remain the property of the contributing cohorts, whose representatives manage the ART-CC via the steering committee of the Collaboration. External collaboration is welcomed. Details of contacts are given on the ART-CC website (www.art-cohort-collaboration.org)."
3586,0.015,3.0000,"Both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) lead to chronic infection in a high percentage of persons, and an expanding epidemic of HIV-1-HCV coinfection has recently been identified. These individuals provide an opportunity for simultaneous assessment of immune responses to two viral infections associated with chronic plasma viremia. In this study we analyzed the breadth and magnitude of the CD8(+)- and CD4(+)-T-lymphocyte responses in 22 individuals infected with both HIV-1 and HCV. A CD8(+)-T-lymphocyte response against HIV-1 was readily detected in all subjects over a broad range of viral loads. In marked contrast, HCV-specific CD8(+)-T-lymphocyte responses were rarely detected, despite viral loads in plasma that were on average 1,000-fold higher. The few HCV-specific responses that were observed were relatively weak and limited in breadth. CD4-proliferative responses against HIV-1 were detected in about half of the coinfected subjects tested, but no proliferative response against any HCV protein was found in these coinfected persons. These data demonstrate a major discordance in immune responses to two persistent RNA viruses. In addition, they show a consistent and profound impairment in cellular immune responses to HCV compared to HIV-1 in HIV-1-HCV-coinfected persons."
16113,0.015,3.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) commonly co-infects HIV-infected individuals. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with elevated serum lipid levels, and HCV infection is associated with low serum lipid levels. Fasting lipid levels were investigated in 1,434 ART-naïve HIV-infected people participating in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Longitudinal Linked Randomized Trials (ALLRT) protocol who prospectively initiated ART with 3 agents. Subjects with elevated liver-associated enzymes (>5 x ULN) were excluded. Demographics, body mass index, HCV status, CD4 cell count, HIV RNA, liver enzymes, lipid levels, and glucose were assessed before and following 48 weeks of ART. HCV-positive subjects (n = 160; 11%) were older, more likely to be Black, have a history of intravenous drug use (IDU), have higher baseline liver-associated enzyme levels than the HCV-negative group (p < .001 for each), and to have diabetes at baseline (5% vs. 2%, p = .07). Lipid levels rose in both groups following ART, and the differences were not significant except that HDL levels increased significantly more in the HCV-positive group (p = .006). In summary, HCV infection did not appear to provide significant protection against ART-induced hyperlipidemia in this cohort of HIV-infected subjects prospectively enrolled in ART trials, although HDL levels rose to a greater degree."
5949,0.015,3.0000,"Longitudinal investigations of an adult male population of Kenyan car washers who have heavy and quantifiable occupational exposure to Schistosoma mansoni cercariae revealed that some individuals develop resistance to reinfection while others remain highly susceptible. We sought to characterize immune correlates associated with host protection in this population. Previous studies have demonstrated an association of peripheral eosinophilia with resistance to reinfection with schistosomes. Thus, we investigated the relationship between the percentage of circulating eosinophils and the effect of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coinfection on the susceptibility of the car washers to reinfection with schistosomes. Elevated percentages of circulating eosinophils were associated with resistance to reinfection by S. mansoni in HIV-1-seronegative persons. In the HIV-1-seropositive cohort, low CD4+-T-cell counts were associated with a less intense eosinophilia. Moreover, eosinophils from the car washers expressed high levels of FcepsilonRI beta chain, a molecule important in immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated immunity. Levels of FcepsilonRI beta chain expression correlated with serum levels of total and antigen-specific IgE for HIV-1-negative car washers, but this was not the case for individuals coinfected with HIV-1. Overall, these data further implicate eosinophils as having a potential role in development of protective immunity against schistosomes and suggest that changes associated with HIV-1 coinfection increase susceptibility to reinfection."
8854,0.015,3.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with substantial clinical and economic burden and is an important public health issue in Asia. The objective of this review was to characterize HCV epidemiology and related complications in China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. A search of electronic databases and conference abstracts identified 71 potentially relevant articles. Of those, 55 were included in the epidemiology review and 9 in the review of HCV-related complications. HCV prevalence in the general population was 1.6% in China, 0.6-0.9% in Japan, 0.6-1.1% in South Korea and 1.8-5.5% in Taiwan. Prevalence was higher for injecting drug users (48-90%) and those with human immunodeficiency virus coinfection (32-85%) and was lower for blood donors (<1%). Annual incidence of HCV in China was 6.01 per 100,000. HCV genotype 1b was associated with the highest incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Five-year survival for patients with liver cirrhosis was 73.8%, decreasing to 39.2% following liver transplantation; the majority of deaths were attributable to HCC. Limitations were that the majority of studies included in the epidemiology review were small, regional studies conducted in specific populations, and there was an absence of large population-based studies. Thus, estimates may not be representative of the epidemiology of HCV for each country. The prevalence HCV in China and HCV incidence in the Asian region remain largely unknown, and they are likely underestimated. Further epidemiologic and clinical data are needed to provide more precise estimates for use by public health agencies."
1797,0.015,3.0000,"The primary objective of this study was to gain a clearer understanding of the barriers to adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) faced by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHIV/AIDS) on Long Island, New York. Focus group, a qualitative research method, was used to study these barriers. The study was conducted in 1998 on Long Island, NY, at five institutions that provide services to 1700 PLWHIV/AIDS. Five focus groups were conducted with 6 to 13 PLWHIV/AIDS in each group, a total of 39 subjects. PLWHIV/AIDS identified eight common barriers to adherence to HAART. In descending order, the barriers include: (1) frequency and severity of side effects, (2) conflicts with daily routines, (3) dietary requirements, (4) frequency of taking medications, (5) number and dosage of medications, (6) psychosocial factors (i.e., stress, feeling good, and bad news), (7) pharmacy refills, and (8) physiological needs (i.e., sleep, hunger, or thirst). Many factors play a role in the success or failure of HAART, including preexisting drug resistance, drug-drug interactions, and the ability of PLWHIV/AIDS to adhere to a rigid and frequently changing medication regimen. The information gleaned from focus groups is limited in that it may not be generalized to a larger population with any known reliability. However, clinicians sensitive to barriers to adherence to HAART, including those identified by PLWHIV/AIDS in this study, may play a more proactive role in supporting adherence to the medication regimen, increasing the durability of effective viral suppression, decreasing morbidity and mortality, and decreasing the selection and transmission of resistant strains of HIV."
1133,0.015,3.0000,"Natural killer (NK) cell function, based on the expression of activating and inhibitory natural killer receptors (NKRs), may become abnormal during human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In this study, we investigated changes in receptor expression with individual and combinational analysis on NK cell subsets in HIV-infected Chinese. The results showed that natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) expression on total NK cells decreased significantly in HIV infection, while the expressions of natural killer group 2 member A (NKG2A) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor, three domains, long cytoplasmic tail 1 (KIR3DL1) on total NK cells were not significantly different between any of the groups including HIV-positive treatment-naïve group, AIDS treatment-naïve group, HAART-treatment AIDS group and HIV-negative control group. Individual analysis of NKG2A(+) and KIR3DL1(+) cells revealed no significant differences in expression in any NK cell subsets between any of the groups, but the combinational analysis of NKG2D(-)NKG2A(+), and NKG2D(-)KIR3DL1(+) on the NK CD56(dim) cell subset in the AIDS group were increased compared to the HIV-negative control group. On the contrary, NKG2D(-)NKG2A(+) expression on the CD56(bright) subset decreased in the AIDS group compared to the control group. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) treatment almost completely restored the levels of these receptor expressions. The results indicate that the distinct alteration of activating and inhibitory NKR expression on NK cells and its subsets occurred during HIV progression. Moreover, the imbalanced change of activating and inhibitory NKRs on NK cells and its subsets may explain the impaired NK cell immunity in HIV infected individuals."
17671,0.015,3.0000,"This article explores how a group of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients perceived their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in relation to their coping capacity expressed as sense of coherence. The emphasis was on gender differences. The sample consisted of 55 women (29%) and 134 men (71%), receiving outpatient medical care in a hospital. Self-report instruments, the health index, the HIV symptom scale, the well-being scale, the sense of coherence (SOC) scale and the Interview Schedule for Social Interaction were used. Disease status (HIV CDC classification, absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count and HIV/RNA) was also measured, and demographic data were collected. The total sample scored significantly worse self-rated health and weaker SOC than healthy controls. The HIV-infected women were significantly younger than the men (p < 0.0001). The majority of the women (60%) were infected by heterosexual transmission and of the men (58%) by homosexual/bisexual contacts. In the univariate analysis the women scored significantly less positive well-being (p < 0.05), weaker SOC (p < 0.05), and less social support (p < 0.01) than the men despite less advanced disease. Multiple regression analyses revealed that SOC was the strongest predictor of subjective HRQOL in both genders. The results suggest that health professionals who individualize their care of HIV-infected patients should try to be sensitive to the different ways in which men and women express their HRQOL."
5881,0.015,3.0000,"The pathways through which stigma is associated with psychological distress remains understudied in Africa. This study evaluates stigma among 277 Mozambicans who were on an antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens for a full year. Using bivariate and multiple regression analyses, we examine psychosocial factors (disclosure decisions, perceived social support, and depression) associated with stigma, at ART initiation and 1 year later. We found 1 year after initiating ART, participants reported no change in stigma, a decrease in perceived social support, and an increase in depressive symptomology. Disclosing HIV status to friends (versus family or partner) was associated with lower levels of stigma. These findings suggest that HIV care in comparable settings should include counselling, support groups, and peer support, that includes stigma and disclosure concerns prior to and during the first year following diagnosis. Most importantly, assessment and treatment of depression should be incorporated into ongoing HIV care."
5577,0.015,3.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is associated with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. This is the first study of the efficacy of long-term lamivudine therapy for patients with HBV infection after OLT. Eight patients (5 men, 3 women) aged 35 to 63 years (mean, 50 years) with HBV infection after OLT (6 patients, recurrent infection; 2 patients, de novo infection) were treated with lamivudine, 100 mg/d, on a compassionate-use basis. Before treatment, all had detectable HBV DNA in serum, and 5 patients (62.5%) had detectable serum hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg). Duration of treatment was 24 to 50 months (mean, 36 months). Patients were monitored for serum alanine aminotransferase level (ALT), HBV DNA (by hybridization), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and HBeAg before and after therapy, and liver histological findings were scored for inflammation and fibrosis. After treatment, 3 patients (32.5%) had undetectable HBV DNA by hybridization assay. None of the patients lost serum HBeAg and HBsAg, except for 1 patient who lost serum HBeAg and became serum antibody to HBeAg-positive. Serum ALT levels normalized in 5 patients (62.5%). Blinded histological assessment showed improvement in 1 patient, no change in 2 patients, and worsening in 5 patients. YMDD variants of HBV were detected in 5 patients (62.5%) within 9 to 20 months (mean, 13 months) of lamivudine therapy. Of these, 2 patients (40%) had hepatic failure (1 patient died of massive variceal bleed) and 3 patients remain clinically stable. Lamivudine therapy was continued in the latter patients. Although lamivudine is a potentially effective therapy for HBV infection after OLT, emergence of high mutation rates with long-term therapy, histological progression, and the possibility of hepatic failure point to the need to investigative combinations of antiviral therapy."
2238,0.015,3.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has become a treatable chronic disease with near-normal life expectancy when patients receive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Family physicians and other primary care clinicians commonly provide long-term comprehensive care for persons with HIV infection. This article describes the scope of initial care, including obtaining a thorough history; physical examination for HIV-associated manifestations; attention to HIV-specific immunization schedules; routine and HIV-specific laboratory evaluation; and ensuring standard health care maintenance to prevent HIV- and non-HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Clinicians should encourage combination ART as early as possible, although careful assessment of patient readiness and ability to sustain lifelong treatment must be weighed. After ART initiation, monitoring viral load and CD4 lymphocyte response is essential to ensure viral suppression and evaluate immune system restoration. Opportunistic infections are now less common than in the past because ART usually prevents or markedly delays progression to advanced HIV disease. The most important reasons for consultation or comanagement with an HIV expert include management of antiretroviral drug resistance or drug toxicities, as well as special circumstances such as viral hepatitis coinfection or pregnancy."
3043,0.015,3.0000,"A large proportion of human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV-Ab) positive male soldiers are considered to be at no identified risk (NIR) because they do not disclose histories of sexual activity with other men, intravenous drug use, blood transfusions, or sexual activity with persons at known high risk for HIV infection. A case-control study involving personal interviews with 26 NIR cases and 74 controls was conducted to determine if lifestyle information that might jeopardize a soldier's military career could be obtained from an Army population and to evaluate risk factors for prevalent HIV infection. Subjects consented to a voluntary, anonymous, and confidential interview containing information on demographic characteristics, medical history, drug use, and sexual behavior. Of 26 cases interviewed, 20 (76.9%) reported behaviors defined by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as risk factors for HIV infection, while 11 of 74 (14.9%) controls also reported such behaviors. This proportion of reclassified NIR cases was similar to that reported from the NIR case series study conducted by the CDC. Of the six (23.1%) cases who remained at NIR, all reported at least one of the following risks: a history of sexually transmitted diseases, sexual contact with prostitutes, or sexual activity with female partners which caused bleeding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3415,0.015,3.0000,"To examine racial/ethnic and gender disparities in antiretroviral (ART) use and viral suppression among HIV-infected persons in care and identify factors that might account for observed disparities. The Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) is a complex sample survey of HIV-infected adults receiving medical care in the United States. We used weighted interview and medical record data collected 06/2009 to 05/2012 to estimate the prevalence of ART use and viral suppression among gender-stratified racial/ethnic groups. We used χ² tests to identify significant differences in outcomes between white men versus other groups, and logistic regression models to identify the most parsimonious set of factors that could account for each observed difference. We found no significant disparity in ART use between white and Hispanic men, and no disparities between white men and white and Hispanic women after adjustment for disease stage, age, and poverty. Disparities in ART use between white men and black persons persisted after adjusting for other factors, but the observed differences were relatively small. Differences in ART use and adherence, demographic characteristics, and social determinants of health such as poverty, education, and insurance accounted for the observed disparities in viral suppression between white men and all groups except black men. In our model, accounting for these factors reduced the prevalence difference in viral suppression between white and black men by almost half. We found that factors associated with disparities differed among men and women of the same race/ethnicity, lending support to the assertion that gender affects access to care and health status among HIV-infected patients. In addition to supporting efforts to increase ART use and adherence among persons living with HIV, our analysis provides evidence for the importance of social determinants of health in understanding racial/ethnic and gender differences in ART use and viral suppression."
16856,0.015,3.0000,"Patients infected through commercial blood-selling practices (former plasma donors, FPDs) in China represent a unique patient population compared to individuals infected through sexual contact or intravenous drug use. FPDs all have an approximate time of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection during the mid-1990s. Few studies about the natural history of HIV infection in these patients were performed. The current study focuses on characterizing the duration of asymptomatic infection as well as the time to disease and mortality of infected FPDs in China. A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on data collected from 5484 HIV-1 infected FPDs in Shangcai county, Henan province. Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied to estimate the asymptomatic duration from the time of infection to the onset of AIDS as well as the survival period from the onset of AIDS to the time of death. The estimated median asymptomatic phase was about 9.21 years, which is similar to that reported in other developing countries in Africa. The estimated median life span after the onset of symptoms was about 9.91 months, which is notably shorter than life spans reported elsewhere. This is the first large-scale retrospective study on the natural history of HIV infection in FPDs in rural China. The findings not only provide valuable insight into an understudied population, but should also serve as an important reference for patient management and care."
8423,0.015,3.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major health issue globally. Owing to the progress made in host genetics and HCV molecular virology, emerging data have suggested that the natural course and treatment response in patients with HCV infection are largely determined by complex host‑viral interactions. HCV genotype is the most important viral factor predicting the response to pegylated interferon‑α plus ribavirin therapy. The subtype of HCV genotype 1 is the key viral factor that predicts the efﬁcacy of direct‑acting antiviral therapy. HCV genome heterogeneity and baseline viral load are additionally associated with the treatment response. Multiple host genetic variants localized in genes associated with the immune response have been identified as predictors of spontaneous disease course and therapy outcome in chronic HCV. However, most findings from candidate gene association studies have not been proven universal for all investigated populations and independent studies. Previous findings in independent large genome wide association studies confirmed that interferon‑λ3 gene polymorphisms are associated with spontaneous clearance and treatment responsiveness. A polymorphism of the inosine triphosphatase gene has been identified as a protective factor against ribavirin‑induced anemia and dose reductions. Another genetic variant in the patatin‑like phospholipase domain containing 3 genes is associated with hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in patients with HCV. The present review focused on the identified viral and host factors associated with outcomes of patients with HCV, and assessed the involvement of viral and host genetics in the natural history and treatment outcomes of HCV infection. This will provide novel ideas concerning personalized prevention and individualized clinical management."
7013,0.015,3.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a controversial indication for liver transplantation (LT) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients because of reportedly poor outcomes. This prospective, multicenter US cohort study compared patient and graft survival for 89 HCV/HIV-coinfected patients and 2 control groups: 235 HCV-monoinfected LT controls and all US transplant recipients who were 65 years old or older. The 3-year patient and graft survival rates were 60% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 47%-71%] and 53% (95% CI = 40%-64%) for the HCV/HIV patients and 79% (95% CI = 72%-84%) and 74% (95% CI = 66%-79%) for the HCV-infected recipients (P < 0.001 for both), and HIV infection was the only factor significantly associated with reduced patient and graft survival. Among the HCV/HIV patients, older donor age [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.3 per decade], combined kidney-liver transplantation (HR = 3.8), an anti-HCV-positive donor (HR = 2.5), and a body mass index < 21 kg/m(2) (HR = 3.2) were independent predictors of graft loss. For the patients without the last 3 factors, the patient and graft survival rates were similar to those for US LT recipients. The 3-year incidence of treated acute rejection was 1.6-fold higher for the HCV/HIV patients versus the HCV patients (39% versus 24%, log rank P = 0.02), but the cumulative rates of severe HCV disease at 3 years were not significantly different (29% versus 23%, P = 0.21). In conclusion, patient and graft survival rates are lower for HCV/HIV-coinfected LT patients versus HCV-monoinfected LT patients. Importantly, the rates of treated acute rejection (but not the rates of HCV disease severity) are significantly higher for HCV/HIV-coinfected recipients versus HCV-infected recipients. Our results indicate that HCV per se is not a contraindication to LT in HIV patients, but recipient and donor selection and the management of acute rejection strongly influence outcomes."

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 6 weeks in individuals with recent HCV infection. In this open-label study conducted in Australia and New Zealand, adults with recent HCV (duration of infection <12 months) received sofosbuvir 400 mg daily and weight-based ribavirin (<75 kg, 1,000 mg/day; ≥75 kg, 1,200 mg/day) for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virological response at posttreatment week 12 (SVR12). Nineteen participants commenced sofosbuvir and ribavirin (89% male, 74% with human immunodeficiency virus, 68% genotype 1a).

In addition, a blinded serosurvey of a representative sample of patients was performed to obtain an unbiased estimate of seroprevalence in clinic attendees. The seroprevalence in the blinded serosurvey was 7.5% (26/348), while the seroprevalence of the 1,201 volunteers for the nonblinded study was 11.2%. For men in the nonblinded study, the risk behaviors most strongly associated with HIV-1 infection were intravenous drug use, sexual contact with another man, and sexual contact with a female intravenous drug user. For women, intravenous drug use and sexual contact with a man at risk for HIV-1 infection (an intravenous drug user or a bisexual) were most important. The seroprevalence among persons who denied all high-risk behavior was 1% (7/723). The results of this study, conducted in a city with one of the nation's highest reported cumulative incidences of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, suggest that HIV-1 infection in clinic attendees was primarily limited to intravenous drug users, homosexual/bisexual men, and the sexual partners of these two groups."
4130,0.015,3.0000,"Previous research suggested that the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) was associated with increased risky sexual behavior. This study examined the relationship between unprotected anal or vaginal sex (UAV) and ART use and adherence in a cross-sectional survey conducted in 874 randomly selected, sexually active patients at 6 public HIV clinics in California. Patients completed a standardized interview in 1998-1999 regarding HIV history, sexual behavior, illicit drug use, and ART use and adherence. Thirty-four percent reported UAV, defined as anal or vaginal sex without a condom within the past 3 months. Of 79% on ART, 26% reported <95% adherence. Decreased odds for UAV were found for both ART use, odds ratio (OR) 0.5 (95% CI 0.4-0.7, P < 0.001) and adherence to ART of > or = 95%, OR 0.6 (95% CI 0.4-0.8, P < 0.001). These relationships persisted in most stratified analysis for both ART use and adherence but in multivariate analysis only for ART use. An undetectable HIV RNA was associated with decreased odds of UAV, OR 0.6 (95% CI 0.5-0.8, P < 0.001). Contrary to expectations, use of and adherence to ART and their consequent suppression of HIV were associated with a decreased prevalence of self-reported risky sexual behavior."
7829,0.015,3.0000,"Although patient satisfaction has been examined in relation to HIV services for ambulatory and managed care, less is known about perceptions of hospital care, particularly for HIV-positive women and minorities. The purpose of this study was to examine HIV-positive women and minority patients' satisfaction with hospital care. The study was part of a larger funded study that explored potential health care disparities for HIV-positive women and minority persons in the era of HIV combination drug therapy. A convenience sample of 50 HIV-positive persons was recruited from four medical centers/hospitals in a South Florida community. The multi-ethnic sample included 31 women and 19 men. The survey tool used was Cleary's HIV-Infected Patient's In-Hospital Questionnaire. Findings revealed that participants were generally satisfied with their hospital care. Physicians, nurses, and the hospital environment received satisfactory ratings. However, several problem areas were identified, including pain management and education on side effects of HIV medications, indicating the need for interventions to improve care. Experimental AIDS drugs were discussed with less than half of the participants, suggesting that HIV-positive women and minority patients may not have equal access to clinical drug trials. Further research is also needed to determine whether attitudes conveyed by health care providers influence HIV-positive patients to be wary of advance directives. The competence of nurses experienced in acute-care nursing of persons with HIV/AIDS was an important factor in patient satisfaction. A lack of experienced acute-care AIDS nurses may ultimately lead to a decrease in HIV-positive patients' satisfaction with hospital care."
5544,0.015,3.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted disease (STD)-related risks in peacekeeping troops is a concern when they are stationed in areas of high HIV prevalence. We carried out an assessment of a situationally focused individual HIV/STD reduction intervention (where avoidance of risk situations, as well as risk behaviors, are emphasized) in one Nigerian military unit (N = 1,222), with a comparable unit from the same service as a waiting list control (N = 987). The intervention consisted of a possible five modules that were presented to groups of up to 50 personnel. Data were collected on reported sexual behaviors, condom beliefs, sexual risk behaviors with casual partners, and number of interventions attended. Data indicated significant increases in reported condom use with casual partners and positive condom beliefs at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Risk behavior was reduced 30% from baseline at 6 months and 23% from baseline at 12 months. There was also a significant dose-response effect for number of interventions attended. These data suggest that relatively brief situationally focused individual interventions are effective in military and West African contexts in reducing HIV/STD risk behaviors."
19831,0.01,2.0000,"As a chronic illness, HIV/AIDS requires life-long treatment adherence and retention-and thus sufficient attention to the psychosocial dimensions of chronic disease care in order to produce favourable antiretroviral treatment (ART) outcomes in a sustainable manner. Given the high prevalence of depression in chronic HIV patients, there is a clear need for further research into the determinants of depression in this population. In order to comprehensively study the predictors of depressive symptoms in HIV patients on ART, the socio-ecological theory postulates to not only incorporate the dominant individual-level and the more recent community-level approaches, but also incorporate the intermediate, but crucial family-level approach. The present study aims to extend the current literature by simultaneously investigating the impact of a wide range individual-level, family-level and community-level determinants of depression in a sample of 435 patients enrolled in the Free State Province of South Africa public-sector ART program. Structural equation modeling is used to explore the relationships between both latent and manifest variables at two time points. Besides a number of individual-level correlates-namely education, internalized and external stigma, and avoidant and seeking social support coping styles-of depressive symptoms in HIV patients on ART, the study also revealed the important role of family functioning in predicting depression. While family attachment emerged as the only factor to continuously and negatively impact depression at both time points, the second dimension of family functioning, changeability, was the only factor to produce a negative cross-lagged effect on depression. The immediate and long-term impact of family functioning on depression draws attention to the role of family dynamics in the mental health of people living with HIV/AIDS. In addition to individual-level and community-based factors, future research activities should also incorporate the role of the family context in research into the mental health of HIV patients, as our results demonstrate that the familial context in which a person with HIV on ART resides is inextricably interconnected with his/her health outcomes."
11526,0.01,2.0000,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) transgenic mouse (Tg) 50-4 strain is immunologically tolerant to HBV antigens. Various vaccination strategies have been attempted but failed to break the tolerance in the mouse. Although the tolerance to HBV antigen is maintained, this mouse strain develops spontaneous liver disease beginning at the age of about 3 months. We attempted to induce immune responses to HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) in the Tg by immunization with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing HBsAg (vvHBV), and observed different immunological responsiveness between 2-month-old and 5-month-old Tg. In contrast to the unbreakable tolerance reported previously, we could induce both the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and the antibody response against HBsAg by the vvHBV immunization. The cytokine expression pattern indicated that T helper 1 type immune response was induced. However, interestingly, these immune responses were observed only in the 5-month-old Tg, but not in the 2-month-old Tg. Furthermore, CD4+ T cells from 2-month-old mice, but not those from 5-month-old mice, inhibited CTL response to HBV antigen when adoptively transferred to C57BL/6. These results suggest the possible involvement of regulatory T cell function in the HBV Tg for maintaining tolerance. This study would contribute to a better understanding of immune status of the HBV Tg as a model of human chronic hepatitis and to the search for new therapeutic targets for chronic viral infections."
6520,0.01,2.0000,"A high degree of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is necessary for long term treatment effects. This study explores the role of timing of ART intake, the information patients received from health workers, local adherence patterns, barriers to and facilitators of ART among 28 HIV-positive adults at the Senkatana HIV Clinic in Maseru, Lesotho. This qualitative, semi-structured interview study was carried out during February and March of 2011 and responses were analyzed inspired by the Grounded Theory method. Results were then compared and discussed between the authors and the main themes that emerged were categorized. The majority of the respondents reported having missed one or more doses of medicine in the past and it was a widespread belief among patients that they were required to skip the dose of ART if they were ""late"". The main barriers to adherence were interruptions of daily routines or leaving the house without sufficient medicine. The use of mobile phone alarms, phone clocks and support from family and friends were major facilitators of adherence. None of the patients reported to have been counseled on family support or the use of mobile phones as helpful methods in maintaining or improving adherence to ART. Being on-time with ART was emphasized during counseling by health workers. In conclusion, patients should be advised to take the dose as soon as they remember instead of skipping the dose completely when they are late. Mobile phones and family support could be subjects to focus on during future counseling particularly with the growing numbers of mobile phones in Africa and the current focus on telemedicine. "
17043,0.01,2.0000,"We examined the impact of antiretroviral treatment adherence among hepatitis C (HCV) coinfected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients on survival and clinical outcomes. We analyzed Medicaid claims data from 14 southern states from 2005 to 2007, comparing survival and clinical outcomes and cost of treatment for HIV and HCV coinfected patients (N = 4115) at different levels of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). More than one in five patients (20.5%) showed less than 50% adherence to antiretroviral treatment, but there were no racial/ethnic or gender disparities. Significant survival benefit was demonstrated at each incremental level of adherence to ART (one-year mortality ranging from 3.5% in the highest adherence group to 26.0% in the lowest). Low-adherence patients also had higher rates of hospitalization and emergency department visits. Relative to patients with high (>95%) ART adherence, those with less than 25% treatment adherence had fourfold greater risk of death (adjusted odds ratio 4.22 [95% CI: 3.03, 5.87]). Nondrug Medicaid expenditures were lower for high-adherence patients, but cost of medications drove total Medicaid expenditures higher for high-adherence patients. Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved (relative to the <25% low-adherence group) ranged from $21,874 for increasing adherence to 25-50% to $37,229 for increasing adherence to 75-95%. Adherence to ART for patients with HIV and HCV coinfection is associated with lower adverse clinical outcomes at a Medicaid cost per QALY commensurate with other well-accepted treatment and prevention strategies. Further research is needed to identify interventions which can best achieve optimal ART adherence at a population scale."
19512,0.01,2.0000,"Although adherence is an important key to the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy (ART), many people living with HIV (PLWH) fail to maintain optimal levels of ART adherence over time. PLWH with the added burden of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection possess unique challenges that potentially impact their motivation and ability to adhere to ART. The present investigation sought to (1) compare ART adherence levels among a sample of HIV/HCV-coinfected versus HIV-monoinfected patients, and (2) identify whether ART-related clinical and psychosocial correlates differ by HCV status. PLWH receiving ART (N = 215: 105 HIV/HCV-coinfected, 110 HIV-monoinfected) completed a comprehensive survey assessing ART adherence and its potential correlates. Medical chart extraction identified clinical factors, including liver enzymes. Results demonstrated that ART adherence did not differ by HCV status, with 83.7% of coinfected patients and 82.4% of monoinfected patients reporting optimal (i.e., ≥95%) adherence during a four-day recall period (p = .809). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that regardless of HCV status, optimal ART adherence was associated with experiencing fewer adherence-related behavioral skills barriers (AOR = 0.56; 95%CI = 0.43-0.73), lower likelihood of problematic drinking (AOR = 0.15; 95%CI = 0.04-0.67), and lower likelihood of methamphetamine use (AOR = 0.14; 95%CI = 0.03-0.69). However, among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, optimal adherence was additionally associated with experiencing fewer ART adherence-related motivational barriers (AOR = 0.23; 95%CI = 0.08-0.62) and lower likelihood of depression (AOR = 0.06; 95%CI = 0.00-0.84). Findings suggest that although HIV/HCV-coinfected patients may face additional, distinct barriers to ART adherence, levels of adherence commensurate with those demonstrated by HIV-monoinfected patients might be achievable if these barriers are addressed."
18860,0.01,2.0000,"HIV infection has experienced dramatic improvement in morbidity and mortality with the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This prompted a reevaluation of organ-solid transplantation as a treatment option for HIV-infected patients. Some trials in the United States have shown that one- and 2-year graft and patient survival is comparable to HIV-negative transplant population. In Europe the experience is still scarce. The aim of this study is to analyse the outcome and the clinical characteristics of HIV-infected patients who received kidney transplantation in Spain in the HAART era. Ten patients were transplanted in our country since 2001. Only one patient was black. The main cause of end-stage renal disease reported was glomerulonephritis. Six of the recipients were coinfected by hepatitis C virus. Inclusion criteria included undetectable HIV viral load and CD4 counts greater than 200/pL. Immunosuppression consisted of steroids, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, with antibody induction in 4 cases. The median and mean follow-up was 11 and 16.3+/-15.6 (3-46) months, respectively. One recipient lost his graft because of early renal venous thrombosis. The remaining patients are functioning graft with mean serum creatinina level of 1.5 +/- 0.5 mg/dl. Biopsy-proven acute rejection was diagnosed in 4 recipients and was reversed in all cases with antirejection treatment. The plasma HIV RNA levels have remained controlled and CD4 counts have been stable in excess of 200 cell/microL. None of patients have developed AIDS complications. Recipients receiving protease inhibitor-based HAART regimens required significant dosing modification to maintain appropriate tacrolimus levels. Our results show that renal transplantation can be a safe and effective treatment in select HIV-infected patients. Like other series, the acute rejection rate was higher than in non-HIV recipients. The reasons of this rejection incidence remain unknown."
7563,0.01,2.0000,"The existence of cervical neoplasia in women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) represents one of the most serious challenges in the oncologic care of immunosuppressed patients. While the development of most cancers in the immunosuppressed patient can be attributed solely to immune deficiency, the relationship between squamous cell neoplasia of the cervix and HIV is quite unique because of common sexual behavioral risk factors. Screening strategies in HIV-positive women must take into account the high prevalence of cervical dysplasia in this subgroup as well as the limitations of cytologic screening. Cervical dysplasia in HIV-positive women may be of higher grade than in HIV-negative patients, with more extensive involvement of the lower genital tract with HPV-associated lesions. The presence and severity of cervical neoplasia in HIV-positive women correlate with both quantitative and qualitative T-cell function. Standard therapies for preinvasive cervical disease have yielded suboptimal results with high recurrent rates. While poor treatment results of standard ablative and excisional therapies warrant unique therapeutic strategies, one must recognize that close surveillance and repetitive treatment have been successful in preventing progressive neoplasia and invasive cervical carcinoma. The disease characteristics of invasive cervical carcinoma may take a more aggressive clinical course in HIV-infected women. HIV-positive women with cervical cancer have higher recurrence and death rates with shorter intervals to recurrence and death than do HIV-negative control subjects. CD4 status does influence subsequent outcome. In general, the same principles that guide the oncologic management of cervical cancer in immunocompetent patients should be applied. However, extremely close monitoring for both therapeutic efficacy and unusual toxicity must be instituted."

17569,0.01,2.0000,"The majority of studies of HIV-1 drug resistance have involved subtype B viruses. Here we have characterized subtype distribution and determined the levels of polymorphism at protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) drug resistance positions, in antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-positive Ugandan patients. We have also investigated codon usage variability at these positions and assessed intersubtype recombination within the pol gene. The study population consisted of 187 patients, from a cohort established by the UK Medical Research Council Programme on AIDS in Uganda in 1990. Results indicate that 28.3% of patients were infected with subtype A (n = 53), 64.2% subtype D (n = 120), 6.4% A/D recombinant (n = 12), and 1.1% subtype C (n = 2). Variation in amino acid usage at drug resistance-associated positions was minimal between the two main subtypes (A and D) in RT, but there was appreciable variation in PR. Codon usage, however, was considerably more variable between subtypes A and D in both PR and RT. Thus, while no natural high-level resistance to antiretroviral therapy was detected in this cohort, subtypes A and D may possess different genetic barriers to be overcome in order to achieve resistance. With the increasing introduction of antiretroviral therapy into Africa, such information will be vital in our understanding and evaluation of the development of drug resistance as it occurs, and how to interpret resistance data the type of which has rarely previously been seen. This analysis also significantly increases the number of Ugandan PR and RT sequences characterized to date."
10635,0.01,2.0000,"The work on this thesis began in 2003 when the global HIV epidemic was out of control. A minority of persons with HIV were benefitting fully from the recently introduced highly efficacious antiretroviral therapy (ART) combinations. Among the global challenges were lack of access to good healthcare, drug toxicity, and emergence of drug-resistant virus. It was unknown how long the drugs could maintain their efficacy in the individual even if administered as intended, and there was a fear that the increased drug pressure would increase the prevalence of drug resistance, subsequently leading to transmission of resistant virus from one individual to another, and thereby waning the treatment options available. Hence, we were far from the ideal conditions where an HIV-infected individual gets to know immediately that he/she is infected, has access to specialized medical and social support, receives a drug combination which effectively suppresses the virus and has no side effects, and is free of co-morbid conditions both before and after he/she gets infected. The nine papers on which this thesis is based each aimed to provide new knowledge to aspects of the above. Late diagnosis and late presentation to clinical care continue to be major barriers to improved HIV management. We used nation-wide hospital registries to explore the potential for an indicator disease-based HIV testing strategy. A range of conditions that were manifestations of the HIV infection itself were found to be associated with highly increased risk of HIV diagnosis during the coming year, but less so three to five years later. Other conditions were associated with an almost constant five-year long increased risk of being diagnosed with HIV because they share behavioural risk factors with HIV, making them indicators of not only current HIV but also of future HIV acquisition. Hence, indicator condition-based testing should be adapted to the local epidemic and could be a valuable addition to the existing detection practice. Once diagnosed, getting the full benefit of modern HIV care requires access to a good healthcare system. We compared temporal trends in quality and quantity of ART introduction in Den-mark and Greenland. Despite similar levels of health worker education and economic resources, ART implementation and mortality decline in Greenland lacked several years behind Denmark. The study reminded us that although economy may be a prerequisite for implementing an effective HIV care system, it is certainly not all it takes. The nationwide nature of the Danish HIV Cohort Study also allowed us to study a number of time trends at the population level. Despite what was feared, we found that the prevalence of triple-drug class virological failure (TCF) seemed to have stabilized after 2000; that the incidence rates of drug resistance acquisition were decreasing during 1999-2005; and that the prevalence of potential transmitters of drug-resistant HIV decreased during 1997-2004. We also looked at some of the consequences of virological failure and drug resistance and found that even modest levels of viraemia were associated with a high risk of future failure and death, and that in persons who have experienced TCF, the number and pattern of resistance mutations were independent predictors of death. Hence, despite the overall positive trends in virological failure and drug-resistance development at the population level, our findings underline the crucial importance of always having an effective treatment option available for the individual patient with drug-resistant virus. As mortality was declining for persons with access to ART and good HIV care, it became important to know how long persons with HIV could expect to live compared to the general population. We projected long-term survival and found that a 25-year old person with HIV and without hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection had a 50 per cent chance of surviving another 39 years, only 12.2 years less than a person in a matched general population cohort would survive. With improved survival and declining HIV-related co-morbidity, non-HIV related co-morbidity became a more visible contributor to the health status of persons with HIV. We assessed the impact of non-HIV related comorbidity acquired before the person became infected with HIV. We found that 32% of the observed mortality in our cohort was due to HCV and co-morbidities measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index, 13% corresponded to the background mortality in the population, and that only 55% of the mortality could be attributed to HIV. Our findings confirmed that persons acquiring HIV differ at large from the general population, and that we should not expect overall mortality rates in populations with HIV to reach the levels in the general population. This thesis attempted to map some of the many challenges on the road towards increased survival of individuals and populations with HIV up to a level, which today in many settings is close to that of the general population. The studies in this thesis have each paid their modest contribution to show how crucially important it is to be diagnosed in time, to have access to a well-functioning health system, and to keep free of co-morbidity both before and after acquiring HIV. After many years of struggle and despair, and thanks to enormous advances in prevention and treatment, we are now looking towards a promising future. "
10217,0.01,2.0000,"The HAVCR2 gene encodes TIM-3, an immunoglobulin superfamily member expressed by exhausted CD8+ T cells during chronic viral infection. We investigated whether genetic variation at HAVCR2 modulates the susceptibility to HIV-1 acquisition; specifically we focused on a 3' UTR variant (rs4704846, A/G) that represents a natural selection target. We genotyped rs4704846 in three independent cohorts of HIV-1 exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals with different geographic origin (Italy and Spain) and distinct route of exposure to HIV-1 (sexual and injection drug use). Matched HIV-1 positive subjects and healthy controls were also analyzed. In all case-control cohorts the minor G allele at rs4704846 was more common in HIV-1 infected individuals than in HESN, with healthy controls showing intermediate frequency. Results from the three association analyses were combined through a random effect meta-analysis, which revealed no heterogeneity among samples (Cochrane's Q, p value = 0.89, I2 = 0) and yielded a p value of 6.8 ×10(-4). The minor G allele at rs4704846 was found to increase HAVCR2 expression after in vitro HIV-1 infection. Thus, a positively selected polymorphism in the 3' UTR, which modulates HAVCR2 expression, is associated with the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. These data warrant further investigation into the role of TIM-3 in the prevention and treatment of HIV-1/AIDS."
13160,0.01,2.0000,"Despite the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-infected drug users, particularly crack cocaine users, continue to have high HIV-related morbidity and mortality. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline data for hospitalized HIV-infected crack cocaine users recruited for Project HOPE (Hospital Visit Is an Opportunity for Prevention and Engagement with HIV-Positive Crack Users) in Atlanta and Miami who were eligible for ART (reported any lifetime use of ART or CD4 <350 cells/μl). Among 350 eligible participants, whose mean age was 44.9 years (SD 7.0), 49% were male, 90% were black, and 81% were heterosexual. The median CD4 count was 144 cells/μl, and 78 of 350 (22%) were taking ART. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression to examine individual, interpersonal, and structural factors as potential correlates of ART use. Reporting ≥2 visits to outpatient HIV care in the past 6 months (AOR 7.55, 95% CI 3.80-14.99), drug or alcohol treatment in the past 6 months (AOR 2.29, 95% CI 1.06-4.94), and study site being Miami (AOR 2.99, 95% CI 1.56-5.73) were associated with ART use. Current homelessness (AOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20-0.84) and CD4 <200 cells/μl (AOR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15-0.55) were negatively associated with ART use. Among those taking ART, 60% had an HIV-1 viral load <400 copies/ml; this represented 9% of the eligible population. For HIV-infected crack cocaine users, structural factors may be as important as individual and interpersonal factors in facilitating ART utilization. Few HIV(+) crack cocaine users had viral suppression, but among those on ART, viral suppression was achievable."

Patients known to be homosexual or intravenous drug users were excluded from this study. The spouse of one HIV-seropositive patient became HIV infected and subsequently developed the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Patients with leukemia who were multiply transfused before the availability of screening of blood products for HIV antibody should be counseled regarding their individual risks of HIV infection and the risk to sexual contacts.
8341,0.01,2.0000,"The HIV epidemic in Estonia affects the population of people who inject drugs (PWID) the most, but factors associated with adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among PWID have not been thoroughly examined in Estonia, with particularly limited data regarding beliefs and attitudes of PWID. The objective of this study was to explore the association between ART adherence and individual beliefs, perceived effectiveness of ART, and self-rated health in particular, in this specific population. The study used baseline survey data from a longitudinal intervention study of HIV prevention among PWID in Estonia, in which 107 HIV-infected participants reported current use of ART. Current adherence was measured through the use of a visual analog scale. Approximately half (49%) of the participants reported optimal (≥95%) adherence. The vast majority (81%) believed in the effectiveness of ART. Less than a quarter of the participants (22%) rated their health as good or very good, and a half (52%) reported average health. Individual beliefs and self-reported health were not associated with ART adherence in both bivariate and multivariable analyses. Participants with problem drinking reported significant suboptimal adherence to ART (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.19-0.97). Daily injection drug use was also associated with suboptimal adherence (AOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.91). Problem drinking has not been commonly reported as a factor of suboptimal ART adherence among PWID; further research would be useful to identify the pathways that might be involved."
16565,0.01,2.0000,"Knowledge of factors associated with medication adherence could help HIV clinicians to target persons in need of intervention, design these interventions, and help researchers to plan studies of adherence. This review summarizes the results of 20 studies investigating the issue of barriers to optimal highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence. Only a few determinants were consistently associated with nonadherence. Symptoms and adverse drug effects, psychologic distress, lack of social or family support, complexity of the HAART regimen, low patient self-efficacy, and inconvenience of treatment were the factors most consistently associated with nonadherence. There were inconsistent findings regarding the relationship of adherence and the following variables: sociodemographic characteristics, substance abuse, depressive symptoms, quality of life, CD4+ cell count, knowledge and beliefs about treatment, patients' satisfaction with health care, and patient-provider relationship. A synthesis of findings relating various factors to adherence to HAART is difficult to reach because of several limitations of the existing body of research. These limitations concern the measurement of adherence, the assessment of correlates and predictors of adherence, the study population, and the study design."
11622,0.01,2.0000,"Recent studies have documented dramatic decreases in opportunistic infections, hospitalizations, and mortality among HIV-infected persons, owing primarily to the advent of highly active antiretroviral medications. Unfortunately, not all segments of the population living with HIV benefit equally from treatment. In San Francisco, only about 30% of the HIV-infected urban poor take combination highly active antiretroviral medications, as compared with 88% of HIV-infected gay men. Practitioners who care for the urban poor are reluctant to prescribe these medications, fearing inadequate or inconsistent adherence to the complicated medical regimen. Persons typically must take 2 to 15 pills at a time, 2 to 3 times a day. Some of the medications require refrigeration, which may not be available to the homeless poor. Most homeless persons do not have food available to them on a consistent schedule. Therefore, they may have difficulty adhering to instructions to take medications only on an empty stomach or with food. Lack of a safe place to store medications may be an issue for some. In addition, many urban poor live with drug, alcohol, or mental health problems, which can interfere with taking medications as prescribed. Inconsistent adherence to medication regimens has serious consequences. Patients do not benefit fully from treatments, and they will become resistant to the medications in their regimen as well as to other medications in the same classes as those in their regimen. Development of resistance has implications for the broader public health, because inadvertent transmission of multidrug-resistant strains of HIV has been demonstrated. Concern that the urban poor will not adhere to highly active antiretroviral medication regimens has led to debate on the role of clinicians and public health officials in determining who can comply with these regimens. Rather than define the characteristics that would predict adherence to these regimens, the San Francisco Department of Public Health created a program to support adherence among those who may have the greatest difficulty complying with complicated highly active antiretroviral medication regimens. The program, dubbed the Action Point Adherence Project, was conceived through a community planning process in preparation for a city-wide summit on HIV/AIDS that took place in January 1998. Action Point is funded by the city and the county of San Francisco. Now in its 10th month, the program continues to show promising evidence of improving clients' biological and social indicators."
1996,0.01,2.0000,"Resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) increases with the wider use of this class of antiretroviral therapy. The association between adherence and resistance to NNRTI-based regimens is poorly understood. Predictors of virologic failure and resistance according to a baseline evaluation of nonadherence risk factors were determined in a cohort of 71 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with early virologic response who received an NNRTI-based regimen. During the median follow-up of 29 months, 20 (28%) of 71 patients experienced virologic failure with an NNRTI-based regimen. Virologic failure was associated with repeated drug holidays (> or =48 h of unplanned drug cessation), depression, younger age, and low adherence to therapy during baseline evaluation. Moreover, repeated drug holidays was the only risk factor for developing a major mutation conferring cross-resistance to the NNRTI class (hazard ratio, 22.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.8-180.3; P<.0001). Patients' previous adherence to therapy and drugs genetic barriers, not only the number of pills or doses involved, should be taken into consideration in the decision to simplify highly active antiretroviral therapy."
3869,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related stigma among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) has been associated with adverse health outcomes, including poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy and care, and increased participation in behaviors linked to higher rates of HIV transmission. In China, the incidence of HIV is growing more rapidly among MSM than among other subgroups. This study characterizes and quantifies HIV stigma among HIV-infected MSM in Beijing, China, which arguably may be driving this epidemic. A cross-sectional survey study was performed among 266 HIV-positive MSM in Beijing, China, in 2014. The Berger HIV Stigma Scale was used to measure levels of HIV-related stigma. Participants additionally answered questions regarding socio-demographic characteristics and HIV-associated risk factors; previously validated Mandarin-language scales assessed depression, coping style, and social support networks. Multivariable linear regression models were used to identify variables significantly associated with HIV stigma. The mean overall HIV stigma score among the study population was 112.78 ± 18.11 (score range: 40-160). Higher HIV stigma scores were positively associated with depression (β = 7.99, 95% CI:3.69, 12.29, p < .001) and negative coping skills (β = 0.64, 95% CI:0.21,1.08, p < .01), and was negatively associated with disclosed HIV status (β = -6.45, 95%CI:-11.80, -1.11, p < .05), and availability of social support networks (β = -0.12, 95%CI:-0.22, -0.02, p < .05). Other variables such as poor self-rated health status and presence of opportunistic infections were positively associated with individual dimensions of HIV-related stigma. The results of this study can inform the development of culturally sensitive interventions to reduce HIV-related stigma among MSM with HIV in China, with the overarching goal of reducing HIV transmission in this vulnerable population."
792,0.01,2.0000,"New antiretroviral (ARV) regimens require strict adherence if optimal suppression of HIV is to be maintained. This study is a theory-based examination of racial differences in patient-perceived barriers and reported ARV adherence. Participants (N=149) completed the Patient Medication Adherence Questionnaire (PMAQ), measuring adherence and perceived barriers to adherence. Adherence was defined as a self-report of 100% adherence in the past four weeks. Odds ratios were calculated to determine the relation of reported barriers to adherence for race and gender groups, and for the sample overall. For every ten-point increase in barrier score, there was an 86% increased risk of being non-adherent (OR=1.86; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.91). Adherence was not different between racial and gender groups, nor was total barrier score. However, individual barriers were differentially endorsed across groups. Rather than relying on demographic predictors, which may be only an indirect marker of adherence, evaluations of adherence should examine the psychological and social barriers to positive adherence outcomes in individual patients. Our findings support the use of theory-based behavioural interventions that address perceived barriers to adherence and other health promotion activities."
13409,0.01,2.0000,"The objective of this study was to assess adherence of HIV-1-infected patients who started treatment in the pre-HAART era and to determine variables associated with better adherence, including relevant attitudes and beliefs. This is a cross-sectional study enrolling patients who had received antiretroviral therapy for >or=10 years. Adherence was evaluated through self-reporting and plasma drug concentrations. Treatment variables, attitudes and beliefs were collected during structured interviews. The results show that for 87 patients the median (interquartile range) time on therapy was 13 (10-19) years; 80 were on therapy at the time of analysis. Adherence was >or=95% in 54 patients (67.5%), 90-94% in 22 (27.5%) and <90% in 4 (5%). Drug concentrations were below the lower limit of detection in five patients. Younger age (p=0.014), female gender (p=0.005), current substance abuse (p=0.004) and hepatitis C virus co-infection (p<0.001) were related to lower adherence. Adherence did not differ in relation to different drug families or once- or twice-daily regimens. Patients with adherence <95% were more likely to have interrupted treatment without doctor's recommendation (p=0.009). Adherent patients exhibited a higher perception of risk of developing the illness and of benefits of therapy, higher self-efficacy and intention to adhere and were more influenced by events that motivate medication intake. To conclude, adherence was >90% in most patients on antiretroviral therapy for >or=10 years. Adherence was more related to beliefs about health and illness than to the characteristics of medication or level of knowledge about treatment. Care adherence interventions should include assessment of health beliefs."
6456,0.01,2.0000,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is increasingly reported as a respiratory pathogen in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. We retrospectively reviewed the chest radiographic appearances of 29 HIV-infected adults with bronchopulmonary infection in whom Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the sole respiratory pathogen isolated. The commonest radiographic abnormality was a diffuse reticular (11 patients) or reticulonodular (9 patients) infiltrate in the pulmonary interstitium. Alveolar opacification was seen in seven patients. Cavitation was rare (2 patients), as was ground-glass opacification (2 patients). Five patients had pleural effusions. No patient had mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Normal chest radiographs were seen in eight patients. Although the radiographic appearances of Pseudomonas bronchopulmonary infection in HIV-infected patients are non-specific, an interstitial infiltrate is a common finding. Pseudomonas aeruginosa should be considered along with the commoner pathogen Pneumocystis carinii in the differential diagnosis of an interstitial infiltrate in this group of patients."

We examined the prevalence and covariates of injecting drug use among men participating in the Sydney Gay Community Periodic Survey between 2004-06 and 2011. In 2004-06, data was collected about which drugs were injected, while in 2011, data was collected about hepatitis C (HCV) and esoteric sexual practices. In 2004-06, 5.6 % of men reported injecting drugs in the previous 6 months; 3.4 % reported methamphetamine injection and 0.4 % heroin injection. In 2011, men who injected drugs were less likely to be employed full-time, and more likely to be HCV-positive, HIV-positive, to have used party drugs for sex, and to have engaged in esoteric sexual practices. The strong associations between injecting drug use, sexual risk practices and blood-borne virus infection suggests the need for combined sexual health and harm reduction services for gay and bisexual men who inject drugs."
14572,0.01,2.0000,"Unsafe injection practices significantly increase the risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among injection drug users (IDUs). We examined individual and socio-environmental factors associated with unsafe injection practices in young adult IDUs in San Diego, California. Of 494 IDUs, 46.9 % reported receptive syringe sharing and 68.8 % sharing drug preparation paraphernalia in the last 3 months. Unsafe injection practices were associated with increased odds of having friends who injected drugs with used syringes, injecting with friends or sexual partners, and injecting heroin. Perceived high susceptibility to HIV and perceived barriers to obtaining sterile syringes were associated with increased odds of receptive syringe sharing, but not with sharing injection paraphernalia. Over half the IDUs reported unsafe injection practices. Our results suggest that personal relationships might influence IDUs' perceptions that dictate behavior. Integrated interventions addressing individual and socio-environmental factors are needed to promote safe injection practices in this population."

An HIV seropositive female aged 30 years, presented with a nonitchy rash over the face, breathlessness, diarrhoea and difficulty in raising her hands above her head. A heliotrope rash around the eyes, Gottron's papules and proximal muscle weakness were found to be present. C reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase levels were raised, but creatinine phosphokinase and anti-nuclear antibody profile were normal. Her HIV serostatus was confirmed by Western blotting, keeping in mind the potential for false positive HIV serology in an autoimmune disorder. Her CD4 count was 379 cells/mm3. An X-ray of the chest showed bilateral pleural effusion with raised pleural fluid adenosine deaminase levels. Clinical findings and laboratory investigations favored the diagnosis of DM and HIV infection with tuberculous effusion in an HIV seropositive patient. She was treated with antibiotics, four-drug anti-tubercular treatment, systemic steroids and later, antiretroviral treatment. Chances of a false positive antibody test for HIV should be considered in a patient having an autoimmune disease such as DM."

The response rate was 63.9%. Of the 3339 respondents 22.7% knew of an asymptomatic HIV positive patient within their practice, 5.4% knew of a symptomatic HIV positive patient and 6.4% knew of a patient with AIDS. The estimated annual rate for HIV-related consultations in general practice (including consultations with the 'worried well') was 6.5 per 1000 population. HIV-related consultations occurred more frequently in the four Thames health regions than elsewhere. A sample of 715 practitioners who reported consultations with HIV infected people or those with worries about infection in the previous month, were invited to keep a diary of HIV-related consultations for one week. The response rate to the diary was 64%. Nineteen per cent of the 273 consultations recorded in the diaries were initiated by homosexual men, 16.5% by injecting drug users, 10.3% by the sexual partners of people at risk of infection; 42.9% of consultations were not associated with recognized risk factors. The results indicate that general practitioners have substantial contact with patients with HIV infection, with AIDS and with worries about HIV infection or AIDS. This contact is likely to increase, alongside the anticipated spread of HIV infection, with consequent implications for general practice resources."

This study examined cognitive functioning in 46 HIV-positive gay men relative to an age and education equivalent group of 13 HIV-negative gay men. The HIV-positive men were asymptomatic except for lymphadenopathy or T4 counts less than 700. The cognitive battery measured language, memory, visuospatial, information processing speeds, reasoning, attention, and psychomotor processes. The HIV-positive group was significantly slower in processing information and performed significantly less well than the HIV-negative group on certain verbal memory measures. Deviations of 1 as well as 2 SDs from the norm/control group mean on four or more tests were observed in 43% and 22% of the HIV-positive subjects, respectively, compared with 8% and none of the HIV-negative subjects, respectively. The results suggest that cognitive inefficiency occurs in a subsample of individuals during early HIV infection."
10789,0.01,2.0000,"The aim of the study was to assess adherence with antiretroviral medication in a sample of HIV patients in Hong Kong and identify predictors of adherence. The study used a cross-sectional correlational design. Adherence behaviour was assessed with the use of self-reports. Other scales assessed knowledge with HIV medication, coping, health locus of control, anxiety, depression and fatigue. A blood sample was also obtained to assess CD4+ counts and viral load. Sociodemographic characteristics and medical information were obtained from the medical records. A high adherence rate was found in this sample of 136 predominantly Chinese patients. There were only 13.7% of the patients being classified as non-adherent. Predictors of adherence included high self-efficacy in terms of being certain that the medication schedule will be followed all or most of the time as directed, low tension-anxiety scores, and low intensity of nausea and vomiting (R2=0.304). An expanded regression model revealed additional factors influencing adherence, including coping variables, pain and numbness in the hands and feet, age, disease stage, internal locus of control, fatigue, family support and taking medication twice daily. This model explained 49% of the variance in adherence. The results suggest that adherence is a multidimensional concept. Every effort should be made to assess in individuals those variables found to affect adherence and alter them whenever possible. Continuous support of patients and individualized medication programmes that will help patients adjust their treatment to their lifestyle are recommended."

It is characterized by alterations of body composition and metabolic abnormalities. The goal of the study was to investigate attitudes toward health condition, well-being, and individual appearance in relation to LDS. Outpatients between July and October 2000 in an HIV-specialized unit at the University Hospital of Düsseldorf, Germany, underwent clinical evaluation and received a standardized written questionnaire. Of 389 patients eligible for analysis, 313 patients returned completed questionnaires (response rate, 80.5%). LDS was observed in 37.7%; the predominant manifestation was lipoatrophy of the face (32.9%). Individuals with and without LDS did not differ significantly in their attitude to the quality of their health condition and the amount of disturbance of their well-being by HIV infection. Participants with LDS felt recognizable as HIV-positive by physical appearance in 30.1%, compared to 18.3% in patients without LDS (p = 0.027). This difference became more pronounced after adjustment for gender, age, stage of disease, CD4 cell count, and duration of HAART (odds ratio, 2.04, 95%-confidence interval [CI] 1.09-3.84). In conclusion, LDS does not seem to disturb the general attitude toward health condition and well-being. However, patients presenting with lipodystrophy are about twice as likely to feel recognizable as HIV-positive by their physical appearance. LDS may thus be perceived as a characteristic mark of being HIV-positive by affected persons. A stigmatizing effect and social disadvantages may be the consequences."

A total of 1760 health service providers were randomly sampled from 40 county hospitals in two provinces of China. Using a self-administered questionnaire, participants' demographic characteristics, work history, empathy level, and avoidance attitudes toward PLWHA were collected in a cross-sectional survey. Empathy was higher among participants aged 31-40 years, those who had an associated medical degree, and those who had served in the medical profession for less than 20 years. Nurses, younger providers, and providers with lower education tended to avoid contact with PLWHA. Multiple linear regression model showed that a higher level of empathic attitude toward patients was significantly negatively associated with avoidance attitude toward PLWHA. Service providers' empathy level plays an important role in providing quality care to HIV-infected patients. Future stigma reduction interventions should cultivate empathy as a platform for understanding, effective communication, and trusting provider-patient relationships. PLWHA could potentially benefit from attitudinal change in medical settings."
1125,0.01,2.0000,"Cyclin D2s (CCND2s) are members of the D-type cyclin family. They interact and construct complexes with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4 or 6. The cyclin D2/CDK4 or CDK6 complexes have key roles in controlling the progression of cell cycle from the Gap 1 (G1) phase to the synthesis (S) phase. Overexpression of cyclin D2 is associated with the development of tumors. In this study, we identified 16 sequence variants of CCND2 polymorphisms through direct DNA sequencing in 24 individuals, and 5 common variants were selected for genotyping in larger-scale subjects (n=1100). Genetic associations of those polymorphisms with hepatitis B virus (HBV) clearance and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) outcome among patients with HBV were analyzed. Although no significant association was observed between the polymorphisms and HCC outcome among HBV patients, one common polymorphism in the 5'-untranslated region (that is, rs1049606) and the most common haplotype (CCND-ht1 [T-C-T-A-T]), however, were significantly associated with HBV clearance (odds ratio=0.69, P=0.0002, Pcorr=0.001 and odds ratio=1.37, P=0.0009, Pcorr=0.004, respectively). The minor allele frequency of rs1049606 among the spontaneously recovered (SR) group was significantly higher than that of the chronic carrier (CC) group (frequency=0.403 vs 0.336, P=0.0002). In contrast, the frequency of CCND-ht1 was higher among the CC group than among the SR group (frequency=0.429 vs 0.374, P=0.0009). The information identified in this study might provide valuable insights into generating strategies for control of HBV."
5003,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection is common in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), because the viruses share common routes of transmission. With the marked increase in life expectancy of HIV-infected patients associated with the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, HCV infection has become a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in coinfected patients. As a result, there has been increasing attention to adequate assessment of HCV infection during the last several years. Unlike liver enzymes and HCV RNA levels, which can fluctuate widely and do not correlate with the severity of disease, liver biopsy has become the cornerstone in the evaluation of chronic HCV infection. However, there remain important questions and controversies related to adequately determining the histological severity of liver disease and the role of liver biopsy in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients."

The positive results were as follows: 11/63 (17.5%) for HBV, 5/63 (7.4%) for syphilis, 4/63 (6.3%) for HCV, 3/63 (4.8%) for Chagas' disease, 2/63 (3.2%) for HIV-1/2 and 1/63 (1.6%) for HTLV-I/II. The seroprevalence in prisoners was higher than among blood donors, mainly for antibodies to HIV-1/2, HCV and HBV. This is probably due to low social economic level, illiteracy, higher proportion with a prior history of intravenous drug use and/or unsafe sexual behavior. Therefore, these prisoners constitute a high-risk group and routine screening and counseling are recommended."
3545,0.01,2.0000,"Psychosocial and behavioral factors may be strong predictors of adherence to medications in a wide variety of diseases. Newly emerging antiretroviral medications for HIV have been shown to be effective but require near perfect adherence to offer clinically significant benefits. There is currently great interest in deriving patient factors that may predict optimal medication adherence in HIV-positive persons. In this study, we examined the association of psychosocial and behavioral characteristics using the Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic (MBMD; Millon, Antoni, Millon, Meagher, & Grossman, 2001) and adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among 117 HIV-positive individuals on HAART regimens. Specific indexes of the MBMD were associated with HAART adherence as assessed through patient interview, at baseline assessment, and at 3-month follow-up at a point after which participants had received medication adherence training. As hypothesized, the Medication Abuse scale of the MBMD was uniquely associated with overall adherence at baseline assessment and also predictive of adherence at 3-month follow-up. Additional MBMD scales were also related to overall adherence as well as specific adherence behaviors such as missed doses, following specific instructions, and overmedicating, although the Medication Abuse scale emerged as the most consistent predictor of adherence in the study. These results suggest that the MBMD can be used to predict adherence to HAART medication in a sample of HIV-positive men and women and may subsequently be used to identify those in need of adherence counseling at the point when medications are initiated."

The resultant morbidity and mortality from cirrhosis complications is considerable, with a high human cost. The most affected patients are men aged 40 years or older. Two decades ago, the prognosis for the 300 million ""Australia antigen""-positive people (people with chronic HBV infection) was gloomy, with no effective intervention. Twenty years on, research and development have changed their outlook. Chronic hepatitis should now be diagnosed early, at the asymptomatic stage. Proper assessment and judicial introduction of therapy can suppress replication of HBV and resolve liver inflammation, thereby preventing the silent progression of chronic liver disease to end-stage cirrhosis. Interferon (IFN) monotherapy has been available for nearly 20 years, but various limitations restrict its general application. Injection-based therapies are inconvenient, the response rate is low (33% hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion rate among optimal cases), side-effects are many, and some serious, and the cost is unaffordable for most people. However, in non-cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate disease activity, IFN is still a worthwhile option because the treatment course is shorter, mutation seems less of a problem and most responses are permanent and reduce or abolish late complications. Lamivudine, an oral nucleoside analog with potent antiviral effects, has been approved in many countries. Daily dosing of 100 mg reduces serum HBV-DNA to below detectable levels within 6 weeks. In HBeAg-positive patients, approximately 16% of treated patients seroconverted with the first year. This was associated with significant improvement in liver histology. Long-term treatment induces further HBeAg seroconversion, but overall clinical benefit is undermined by continuous emergence of drug-resistant YMDD mutants. In an Asian multicentre study, 58 patients on 5 years lamivudine therapy showed annual cumulative HBeAg seroconversion rates at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years of 22, 29, 40, 47 and 50%, respectively. The best predictor of response is pretreatment alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Among patients with ALT > 2x the upper limit of normal (ULN), annual HBeAg seroconversion is increased to 38, 42, 65, 73 and 77%, respectively. However, emergence of YMDD mutants occurred at a cumulative rate of 15, 38, 55, 67 and 69%, respectively. The impact of this emergence on disease activity is unpredictable. Thus, while continued disease suppression, or even HBeAg seroconversion, still occurred in some patients, in others hepatitis may relapse and liver failure has been reported despite continuation of lamivudine. While the duration of lamivudine therapy is difficult to define, the best strategy may be to define only active CHB with major ALT elevation (par-ticularly ALT > 5x ULN) for a duration of 1 year or less. Lamivudine can be stopped in responders. The response is durable in approximately 80% of responders. Non-responders should be monitored closely for rebound off treatment. Therapy can be re-instituted if ALT is over 5x ULN. Management of patients with YMDD mutants can be challenging, but there is no clear evidence to recommend stopping or continuing lamivudine, or to add other possible effective agents, such as adefovir dipivoxil. More data are required to help draw up guidelines. Hepatitis B e antigen-negative CHB has been less well studied. Both IFN and lamivudine can suppress disease activity, but permanent responses are few. Without a distinct marker as an end-point for response, the duration of treatment is even more difficult to define. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction for low viral levels may give a clue, but definitive studies are required. Monotherapy is clearly not the answer for the majority of CHB patients with active disease. Combination therapy has the theoretical advantage of additional or synergistic efficacy. Preliminary results on IFN and lamivudine are promising and further clinical trials are ongoing. Emtricitabine (FTC), adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, BL-thymidine (L-dT), DAPD, clevudine (l-FMAU), thymosin, therapeutic vaccines and various herbal medicines are potential candidates. Antiviral action in conjunction with immune modulation may have a better chance of eradicating HBV and its cccDNA in the hepatocytes as the basis for an eventual successful outcome. The key points are: (i) approved therapeutic agents for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are IFN, lamivudine and thymosin (in a few countries only); (ii) indications for IFN therapy are viremia in compensated CHB patients with moderately raised ALT; (iii) lamivudine has broader therapeutic indications: it is effective in subgroups of CHB patients with compensated or decompensated liver diseases, but generally works better if patients have raised ALT; (iv) lamivudine has a potent suppressive action on HBV replication, including HBeAg-negative variants, but cannot eliminate cccDNA; this is the reason for the relapse of disease after discontinuing treatment, unless HBeAg seroconversion is obtained; (v) successful use of lamivudine aims at HBeAg seroconversion or profound suppression of HBV-DNA to serum levels of less than 100 000 viral copies/mL, in order to prevent emergence of drug-resistant YMDD mutants (which commences from 6 months onward); (vi) YMDD mutants may cause a flare of hepatitis, resulting in deterioration of liver histology and, occasionally, liver failure; (vii) combination therapy of lamivudine with IFN (standard or pegylated) or other nucleoside analogs should be the next advance. Preliminary data from IFN and lamivudine combination therapy show some promise, but there are conflicting results."
17912,0.01,2.0000,"Prompt initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is important to reduce comorbidity and mortality among people living with HIV, especially for those with a low CD4 cell count. However there is evidence that not everyone receives prompt initiation of ART after enrolling into HIV care. The current study investigated factors associated with failure to initiate ART within two years of entering into care among those with a CD4 count at or below 350 cells/mm3. The sample included 4,907 ART-naive patients with a CD4 count at or below 350 cells/mm3 enrolled between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2012 at any of eight clinical sites in the Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). The two-year risk of delayed ART initiation was estimated using a log-binomial regression model with stabilized inverse probability of censoring weights for those lost to follow-up. Adjusting for other factors, an earlier enrollment date was the sole demographic characteristic associated with an increased risk of delayed ART initiation. Higher CD4 count, lower viral load, and a prevalent AIDS diagnosis were clinical characteristics associated with delayed ART initiation. Gender, age, race/ethnicity and HIV risk factors such as reported male-to-male sexual contact and injection drug use were not associated with delayed ART initiation. This study identified characteristics of patients for whom treatment was strongly to moderately recommended but who did not initiate ART within two years of entering care. Despite the known benefits of early antiretroviral therapy initiation, a lower viral load measurement may continue to be an important clinical characteristic in the more recent era with current ART initiation guidelines. These findings provide a target for closer monitoring and intervention to reduce disparities in HIV care."
3369,0.01,2.0000,"B vitamins have beneficial roles in mental health functional impairments; however, research on the role of B vitamins in depression among HIV-infected persons is limited. This study assessed the association between dietary B vitamin intake and depressive symptoms in a cohort of HIV-infected persons. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 314 HIV-infected persons (180 men and 134 women) aged 18 to 60 y residing in the Kathmandu, Nepal. The Beck Depression Inventory-I was used to measure depression, with a cutoff score of 20 or higher. Dietary intake was assessed using two nonconsecutive 24-h dietary recalls. The relationships between B vitamins and depressive symptoms were assessed using multiple logistic regression analysis. Twenty-six percent participants (men: 23%; women: 29%) were depressed. More than two thirds of participants' B vitamins intake were below the estimated average requirements (EAR) level. Low intake of riboflavin was associated with an increased risk of depression in women but not in men. Multivariate OR (95% CI) for depression in the first, second, and third tertiles of riboflavin in total participants were 1 (reference), 0.87 (0.46-1.64), and 0.49 (0.24-0.98), respectively (p for trend=0.048) and in women were 1 (reference), 0.94 (0.36-2.40), and 0.23 (0.07-0.77), respectively (p for trend=0.020). No clear associations were seen between other B vitamins and depressive symptoms in either sex. Low intake of riboflavin was independently associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms in all participants and in HIV-infected women. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm the role of vitamin B vitamins in depressive symptoms among HIV-infected persons."
10059,0.01,2.0000,"Most ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral regimens offer comparable levels of virological efficacy. Thus, the tolerability of the regimen becomes a distinguishing factor with implications for patient quality of life (QoL), treatment adherence, and clinical outcome. This article describes results from the CASTLE study (comparing once-daily atazanavir/ritonavir [ATV/RTV] with twice-daily lopinavir/ritonavir [LPV/RTV], both in combination with fixed-dose tenofovir/emtricitabine, in treatment-naive HIV-infected patients) and an evaluation of the impact of gastrointestinal (GI) complications of treatment on patient QoL, as measured by the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) QoL questionnaire (IBS-QoL). Changes in IBS-QoL from baseline over time (to week 24) were classified as: ""Improvement"" (> or =2-point positive change from baseline), ""No change"" (<2-point change), or ""Worsening"" (> or =2-point negative change). Data were collected on GI adverse events (AEs) and use of GI medications. Of the 599 patients with IBS-QoL-evaluable data through week 24, fewer patients in the ATV/RTV group than in the LPV/RTV group experienced grade 2-4 treatment-related GI AEs including diarrhea (3% versus 10%), nausea (5% versus 7%), and vomiting (<1% on both arms). Nearly three times as many patients receiving LPV/RTV used GI medications. ATV/RTV was associated with an increase in overall IBS-QoL scores and more patients receiving ATV/RTV than LPV/RTV experienced improvement in IBS-QoL through week 24. In contrast to LPV/RTV, ATV/RTV treatment was associated with earlier and more positive improvements in QoL scores across CD4 sub-groups. Differences in the health-related QoL profile between ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV may be important when selecting PI-based antiretroviral regimens."
11696,0.01,2.0000,"This study aimed to assess attitudes and potential barriers towards treatment in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, comparing those with and without HIV coinfection. A cross-sectional survey of 82 HCV-infected adults with and without HIV was conducted in greater Los Angeles between November 2013 and July 2015. Overall, there were 53 (64.6%) with HIV coinfection, 20 (25.0%) with self-reported cirrhosis, and 22 (26.8%) with a history of prior HCV treatment. Of all, 93.2% wanted HCV treatment, but 45.9% were unwilling/unable to spend anything out of pocket, 29.4% were waiting for new therapies, and 23.5% were recommended to defer HCV treatment. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were more likely to want treatment within one year (90.2% versus 68.2%, p = 0.02), more willing to join a clinical trial (74.5% versus 8.0%, p < 0.01), more willing to take medications twice daily (86.3% versus 61.5%, p = 0.01), and more likely to prefer hepatitis C treatment by an infectious diseases/HIV physician (36.7% versus 4.0%, p < 0.01). Of all, 77.1% of coinfected patients were willing to change antiretroviral therapy if necessary to treat HCV, but only 48.0% of patients were willing to take a medication if it had not been studied in HIV-positive patients. Treatment preferences differ between HIV/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected patients. Despite a strong willingness among the study cohort to start HCV treatment, other factors such as cost, access to medications, and provider reluctance may be delaying treatment initiation."
1177,0.01,2.0000,"Low adherence and toxicities among HIV-positive patients starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can lead to discontinuation of therapy and treatment failure. Little is known about hepatitis C (HCV) status and discontinuation of HAART. Poisson regression was used to determine factors related to discontinuation of any part of an initial HAART regimen due to treatment failure (TF) or toxicities and patient/physician choice (TOX), and to investigate the relationship between HCV and discontinuation of a HAART regimen in 1198 patients staring HAART after 1999 from the EuroSIDA study. At 1 year after starting HAART, 70% of patients remained on their original regimen, 24% had changed, and 6% were off all treatment. The most frequent reason for discontinuation was toxicities (30.4%). There was no change over time in the proportion of patients discontinuing after stratification by reason for discontinuation (p = 0.18). Of patients 190 stopped at least one antiretroviral drug used in their initial HAART regimen due to toxicities; the toxicity reported did not vary according to HCV status (p = 0.90). Anti-HCV seropositive patients had a higher incidence of discontinuation due to TOX (IRR 1.46, 95% CI 1.13-1.88, p = 0.0042) compared to patients without HCV. Patients with HCV were more likely to discontinue all or part of their HAART regimens due to toxicity or patient/physician choice. Managing adverse events must remain a key intervention in maintaining HAART. There is a need for further studies to describe the relationship between HCV, specific antiretrovirals, and different treatment strategies."
7421,0.01,2.0000,"The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic represents a modern-day plague that has not only resulted in a tragic loss of people from a wide spectrum of society but has reshaped our viewpoints regarding health care, the treatment of infectious diseases, and social issues regarding sexual behavior. There is little doubt now that the cause of the disease AIDS is a virus known as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The HIV virus is a member of a large family of viruses termed retroviruses, which have as a hallmark the capacity to convert their RNA genome into a DNA form that then undergoes a process of integration into the host cell chromosome, followed by the expression of the viral genome and translation of viral proteins in the infected cell. This review describes the organization of the HIV-1 viral genome, the expression of viral proteins, as well as the functions of the accessory viral proteins in HIV replication. The replication of the viral genome is divided into two phases, the early phase and the late phase. The early phase consists of the interaction of the virus with the cell surface receptor (CD4 molecule in most cases), the uncoating and conversion of the viral RNA genome into a DNA form, and the integration into the host cell chromosome. The late phase consists of the expression of the viral proteins from the integrated viral genome, the translation of viral proteins, and the assembly and release of the virus. Points in the HIV-1 life cycle that are targets for therapeutic intervention are also discussed."
9581,0.01,2.0000,"The aims of this study were to estimate medical expenditures on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment and to identify significant associated variables. We performed a retrospective multi-centre study in the Canary Islands using a sample of 569 patients recruited at outpatient visits. The study examined demographic and clinical variables, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and health care resources. Clinical data was obtained from medical records and patient interviews. Several empirical models for identifying the relationship between health care costs and independent variables were developed. The greatest expense came from pharmaceutical expenditure (82.1% of direct costs), while hospital costs only represented 4.6% of total expenditure. The data showed a statistically significant association between health care costs and the CD4 count of the previous year. HRQOL was also a significant variable. Therefore, CD4 cell count can be used to predict health care costs in patients. Policymakers could use this information to help guide their decisions in allocating limited health care resources to HIV treatments."
8465,0.01,2.0000,"The lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) prototype strain of human T-lymphotropic virus type III/LAV was transmitted to juvenile chimpanzees with no prior immunostimulation by (i) intravenous injection of autologous cells infected in vitro, (ii) intravenous injection of cell-free virus, and (iii) transfusion from a previously infected chimpanzee. All five animals that received more than one 50% tissue culture infective dose were persistently infected with LAV or chimpanzee-passaged LAV for up to 18 months. During this time they developed no illnesses, but they exhibited various degrees of inguinal and axillary lymphadenopathy and significant reductions in rates of weight gain. Detailed blood chemistry and hematologic evaluations revealed no consistent abnormalities, with the exception of immunoglobulin G (IgG) hypergammaglobulinemia, which became apparent in one animal 6 months postinfection and continued at more than 1 year postinfection. Transient depressions followed by increases in the numbers of T4 cells to levels greater than normal were observed in all animals after virus inoculation. However, the number of LAV-infected peripheral blood cells decreased with time after infection. Results of enzyme immunoassays showed that all infected animals seroconverted to IgG anti-LAV within 1 month postinfection and that antibody titers remained high throughout the period of observation. In contrast, only three of the five LAV-infected chimpanzees had detectable IgM antibody responses, and these preceded IgG-specific serum antibodies by 1 to 2 weeks. Virus morphologically and serologically identical to LAV was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of all infected animals at all times tested and from bone marrow cells taken from one animal 8 months after infection. One chimpanzee that was exposed to LAV only by sharing a cage with an infected chimpanzee developed lymphadenopathy and an IgM response to LAV, both of which were transient; however, no persistent IgG antibody response to LAV developed, and no virus was recovered from peripheral blood cells during a year of follow-up. Thus, LAV readily infected chimpanzees following intravenous inoculation and persisted for extended periods despite the presence of high titers of antiviral antibodies. However, the virus was not easily transmitted from infected to uninfected chimpanzees during daily cage contact."
5330,0.01,2.0000,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) produced in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures or added exogenously has been shown to upregulate HIV expression in vitro. Inhibition of IL-1 in HIV-infected individuals may inhibit HIV activation and slow disease progression. Recombinant human IL-1 receptor (rHu-IL-1R), the soluble extracellular portion of the human type I IL-1 receptor, inhibits HIV expression in acutely infected primary PBMCs and in the chronically infected promonocytic cell line, U1. We, therefore, conducted a phase I/II trial of the soluble rHu-IL-1R in HIV-1-infected individuals with CD4 T cell counts <300/microl to evaluate its safety and activity. Twelve evaluable patients were enrolled at three rHu-IL-1R dose levels:125 (n=3), 500 (n=3), and 1250 (n=6) microg/m2 per dose by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection three times a week for 8 weeks, followed by a 4 week observation period. rHu-IL-1R was safe and well tolerated. There were no deaths, no treatment-related grade 3/4 events, and no premature study discontinuations because of adverse events. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Seven patients reported improvements in one or more symptoms, including weight gain (3), improved energy level (4), decreased diarrhea (1), decreased night sweats (1), improvement in psoriatic arthritis (1), and improvement in a nonspecific chronic diffuse skin rash (1). Of 3 evaluable patients with Kaposi's sarcoma, 1 remained stable and 2 showed minimal progression. No consistent trends in absolute CD4 counts or percentages, quantitative HIV cultures, or serum p24 antigen, beta2-microglobulin, or triglyceride levels were observed. rHu-IL-1R is safe and well tolerated at the doses tested but induced no consistent changes in objective markers of HIV disease. Symptomatic improvements will require confirmation in randomized, placebo-controlled trials."
7258,0.01,2.0000,"We explored associations between time perspective (TP) and quality of life (QOL) among HIV-infected patients. With the French validated version of the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory, we evaluated the TP of patients. A self-administered questionnaire gathered information about QOL (WHOQOL-HIV), TP, relationship with medical staff and self-reported side effects of HAART. Six scores of QOL - physical, psychological, social relationship, environment, patient independence and spirituality were used as dependent variables in the linear regressions to identify factors associated with QOL. The sample (n=72) for this study was recruited from a hospital department specialising in HIV care and consisted of 48 (67%) HIV-infected women and 24 (33%) HIV-infected men with a mean age of 42 years. Using hierarchical regression analysis adjusted on socio-demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics and co-factors, significant relationships were observed between the several TP orientations and an impaired physical, environmental QOL as well as level-of-independence QOL. Specific dimensions of QOL are influenced by specific orientations of TP, which provides information on self-perception and subjective evaluation of QOL. The TP construct provides keys to managing HIV infection in order to improve QOL."

A total of 432 patients were examined. HIV-related NCI was diagnosed in 238 patients (55.1%), meeting the HIV dementia (HIV-D) criteria in 45 (10.4%). The prevalence of both NCI and HIV-D did not change significantly during the study period. Compared with patients without NCI, patients with NCI were older (40.4 versus 38.2 years; P = .003), had a higher prevalence of positive HCV serology (61.1% versus 38.9%; P = .003), and a lower nadir CD4 cell count (156 versus 222 cells/microl; P < .001). Compared with patients seen during 1996 to 1999, patients with NCI seen during 2000 to 2002 were older (40.7 versus 38.8 years; P = .004), had a less advanced disease stage (previous acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] 28.8% versus 65.7%; P < .001) and a higher nadir CD4 count (174 versus 132 cells/microl; P = .026). This study showed an unchanged prevalence of both HIV-related NCI and HIV-D in the period 1996 to 2002. The authors found evidences for new additional potential risk factors for HIV-related NCI (older age, lower nadir CD4 count, positive hepatitis C virus [HCV] serology), and for a change of risk factors for NCI in the late highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era (older age, less advanced disease, higher nadir CD4 count)."
13936,0.01,2.0000,"According to the World Health Organization, half of the 14 million people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide were infected between the ages of 15 and 24 years. However, details about HIV-positive (HIV+) youths' risk-related behavior and social context have not been previously reported. OBJECTIVES. To outline detailed sexual and drug use practices, social and psychological status of HIV+ youth compared with a cohort of HIV-negative (HIV-) youth; and to examine the ability of the health belief and risk-taking models to predict sexual and drug use acts of HIV+ youth. METHODS. HIV testing was conducted on and a 207-item structured interview covering HIV risk-related acts, protective factors and background information was administered to 72 HIV+ and 1142 HIV- adolescents aged 13 through 21 years receiving care in an adolescent clinical care unit of a large medical center in New York City. Data were analyzed for adolescents reporting sexual intercourse (71 HIV+ and 722 HIV-) by logistic regression analysis of five domains to identify variables significantly associated with HIV seropositivity. RESULTS. Logistic regressions indicated significant differences in sexual risk acts based on serostatus and gender. Anonymous, blinded seroprevalence testing identified 11% more HIV+ adolescents than would have been identified by current counseling and testing practices. HIV+ adolescents were significantly more likely to be sexually abused (33 vs 21%, P < .05), engage in anal sex and survival sex (32 vs 4%, P < .01), unprotected sex with casual partners (42 vs 23%, P < .05), have had sex under the influence of drugs (52 vs 27%, P < .01), have a sexually transmitted disease (59 vs 28%, P < .01), use multiple drugs (43 vs 9%, P < .01) and engage in multiple problem behaviors (72 vs 30%, P < .01) than HIV- young people. HIV+ females reported more oral (69 vs 45%, P < .01) and/or anal (42 vs 12%, P < .01) intercourse compared to HIV- females. HIV+ males reported significantly higher rates of both insertive (82 vs 46%, P < .05) and receptive (51 vs 4%, P < .01) oral and anal (53 vs 13%, P < .01) intercourse than HIV- males. Protective factors were not significantly different for HIV+ and HIV- young people. CONCLUSIONS. Routine, confidential HIV counseling and testing should be considered for adolescents having unprotected sexual intercourse when age-specific services are available for HIV+ youth. Prevention programs should consider adolescents' history of abuse, homelessness, and other social as well as psychological dimensions in designing comprehensive care strategies to address HIV+ adolescents' multiple problem behaviors and living situations. Current theoretical models of health behaviors should be reconsidered, given the lack of their association to HIV risk acts of HIV+ youth. Age-specific services and interventions for HIV+ youth are urgently needed as HIV is spreading among youth worldwide."

The median CD4+ cell count was 186x10(6) cells/L, and the median HIV RNA level was 5 log(10) copies/mL. After 24 months of therapy, 42 (16.5%) of 255 patients had a median CD4+ cell count increase of <100x10(6) cells/L. By logistic regression analysis, previous injection drug use was associated with a CD4+ cell count increase of <100x10(6) cells/L (risk ratio [RR], 2.326; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.077-5.023; P=.032); inclusion of a protease inhibitor (PI) in the HAART regimen reduced the risk of poor immunologic recovery (RR, 0.160; 95% CI, 0.061-0.417; P<.001). Failure of the CD4+ cell count to increase was relatively common among antiretroviral-naive patients in the year after the initiation of HAART and the achievement of complete virus suppression. PI-containing regimens provided better immunologic response."

Institutions have therefore been set up to provide medical care for the destitute. The objectives of this study were to describe the social characteristics of the HIV-positive destitute population attending an out-patient clinic providing free health care for the destitute in a Paris University Hospital, to compare their clinical-epidemiological characteristics with those of non-destitute HIV-positive patients, and to evaluate the quality of their care. We performed a historical prospective study wherein a cohort of 115 HIV-positive destitute patients (defined as having no health coverage at their first consultation) was compared with a control cohort of 183 HIV-positive non-destitute patients attending the same clinic. Ninety-five per cent of the destitute patients had no stable employment, 32% had no source of income, 75% had no permanent residence and 27% were i.v. drug abusers. Fifty-nine per cent were foreigners, most of whom had legal residence papers and had been in France for more than 3 years. When comparing the control and the destitute groups, the latter had a three times greater risk of developing tuberculosis (RH = 3.2, CI 95% = [1.1-9.4]). Medical compliance, access to antiretroviral treatment and hospitalization were identical in both groups. No difference was observed in terms of occurrence of a new AIDS-related disease during follow-up when full-blown AIDS before entry, CD4 count at entry and transmission group were taken into account in multivariate analysis. From the moment that destitute patients attended this adapted medico-social facility, their access to care was the same as, if not better than, that of the other patients. The development of out-patient medico-social facilities for HIV-positive destitute patients must be a public health priority even for those countries theoretically providing generalized health coverage."

A cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV infected IDUs in Dali, China. The participants were tested for serological markers of HBV and HCV infection, alanine transaminase (ALT) activity and CD4(+) T cell count. HCV genotype was determined by sequencing. Of 529 patients, 498 (94.1 %) HIV infected IDUs agreed to participate. The overall prevalence of HCV infection (anti-HCV antibody positive) and spontaneous HCV clearance were 90.8 % (452/498) and 21.5 % (97/452), respectively. Of 411 subjects who had not received HBV vaccine, 296 (72.0 %) were positive for antibody against HBV core antigen (HBcAb), while 274 (66.7 %) were positive for both HCV antibody and HBcAb. HBV antigens were detected in 52 of the HBV-infected subjects (17.6 %). HCV clearance was associated with HBV antigenemia (p = 0.0002) and higher CD4(+) T cell count (p = 0.0294). Resolved HBV infection was associated with HCV genotype 3 (p = 0.0365). HBV and HCV infection are highly prevalent and mutually influence infection status in HIV-1 infected IDUs in Dali, China."
12064,0.01,2.0000,"Sequential specimens obtained from 87 multicenter AIDS cohort study participants were tested by three p24 antigen tests. They included a polyclonal enzyme immunoassay (EIA), a monoclonal EIA, and a monoclonal EIA after immune complex dissociation (ICD) of specimens. Subjects were grouped into two categories defined by real-time testing with the polyclonal EIA: 39 had become positive for p24 antigen (antigen converters) during follow-up, and 48 had progressed to AIDS without detectable antigenemia. Twenty-four (61%) antigen converters were positive by ICD-monoclonal EIA about 1 year earlier than by monoclonal EIA. In contrast, only 12 (25%) patients who progressed to AIDS without detectable antigenemia became positive by ICD-p24 EIA before developing AIDS. Thus, the main benefit of ICD treatment may be to detect p24 antigenemia approximately 1 year before the regular assay rather than to identify additional antigenemic people. Quantitative plasma RNA levels were also determined in longitudinal samples from 20 antigen converters and 7 men who developed AIDS without antigenemia. Although mean human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA levels were higher in antigen-positive than in antigen-negative samples (P = 0.002), more than half (11 of 20) of the antigen converters had no measurable change in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA associated with change to antigen positivity."

A retrospective review was conducted of all HIV-positive patients of an inner metropolitan sexual health service who attended from 1 August 2013 to 31 July 2014 for HIV management. One hundred eighty-eight HIV-positive patients attended the clinic during the study period. The majority were male (96%), Caucasian (70%) and 30-39 years of age (37%). There was a high prevalence of renal risk factors in the population, including potentially nephrotoxic antiretroviral therapy (61%), smoking (38%), hypertension (12%), dyslipidemia (11%) and hepatitis C co-infection (7%). In the previous year, measurements of estimated glomerular filtration rate were performed in all patients, but measurements of lipid profiles, urinary protein and serum phosphate were performed within the last year in only 48%, 33% and 30% of patients, respectively. These are the first comprehensive data regarding renal disease, associated risk factors and screening and management practices in the HIV-positive patient population of a specialized sexual health service in Australia. This patient population demonstrates a particularly high prevalence of risk factors for renal disease. Despite this, screening investigations were not performed as recommended. This represents a potential area to improve patient care."
8687,0.01,2.0000,"Drug users (DU) are a marginalized group and at risk for viral hepatitis, who seldom access health services. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 111 DU with chronic HBV/HCV and 15 in-depth interviews with health professionals/policymakers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Most interviewees were male, non-white, with a low educational background, unemployed and/or living on less than $245 a month (minimun wage). In the last 6 months, 61.8% of interviewees snorted cocaine, 64.7% at least once a week. Half of the interviewees had a stable partner and 38.3% of those with occasional partners never/almost never using condoms. Addiction treatment seeking was found to be associated with: being white (OR:5.5), high-school degree (OR:8.7), and employment (OR:5.7). Hepatitis treatment seeking was high (80.9%), and access to low-threshold, user-friendly health services was key for treatment seeking behaviors (OR:3.6). Missed opportunities for hepatitis treatment seem to be associated with structural (uneven political/financial support to hepatitis programs) and patient-related barriers (severe addiction and non-adherence). Those most in need were less likely to access treatment, calling for renewed strategies, in order to curb hepatitis among impoverished drug users and their sexual partners."
12109,0.01,2.0000,"As the number of women with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) continues to rise in the United States, it becomes important to target preventive interventions as effectively as possible toward those groups at highest risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We analyzed the prevalence of serum antibody to HIV in 333 women admitted to the Gynecology Service at San Francisco General Hospital with acute pelvic inflammatory disease in the years 1985-1988. The proportion of women with HIV infection in our sample rose incrementally over this 4-year period, from 0 to 6.7%. A history of intravenous (IV) drug use conferred a 23-fold risk of HIV seropositivity. In contrast, markers of the level of sexual activity did not correlate significantly with the presence of HIV infection, although the power to detect such an association was limited by the small sample size. An intensification of educational efforts directed at IV drug-using women in San Francisco is necessary to prevent further increases in the rate of HIV infection and further spread into the heterosexual population."
6974,0.01,2.0000,"We report a case of non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining lung adenocarcinoma in a multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patient. The patient was a 47-year-old Japanese woman who received salvage combination anti-retroviral therapy with darunavir plus ritonavir plus raltegravir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine in May 2009. She was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma (T3N3M1, stage IV) in November 2010 and was not found to possess any activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. Therefore, 6 courses of carboplatin plus pemetrexed and 3 courses of gemcitabine followed by erlotinib were administrated, and therapy was changed to home medical care. The only drug-related adverse event was grade 1 neutropenia, and drug interaction between the simultaneously administered anti-retroviral and chemotherapeutic agents was not confirmed. The patient battled lung adenocarcinoma for 1 year after the diagnosis and died of cancer progression in October 2011. Her performance status was stable and the CD4 (+) lymphocyte count and HIV load were well controlled throughout the course of treatment. In conclusion, the agents used for this patient show high tolerability and can be used as an effective treatment strategy for lung cancer occurring in HIV-positive patients."
18703,0.01,2.0000,"The aim of the study was to investigate the association between infection with HIV-1 infection and a history of other sexually transmitted diseases (STD). We were able to match 1295 HIV-1 infected patients who attended St Mary's Hospital between 1985 and 1991 with 1273 seronegative controls on gender, sexual orientation, injecting drug use and age at time of test. The cases were 3 times more likely to have a history of ever having had another STD than the controls: multivariate conditional logistic regression showed that, after controlling for sexual behaviour, for known sexual contact with an HIV infected individual or AIDS patient or with a resident from a high HIV prevalence area, area of residence and for year of test, a history of gonorrhoea, syphilis, hepatitis B, genital herpes or genital warts were all significantly associated with HIV-1 seropositive status. These findings reinforce the need for HIV containment strategies to be promoted in conjunction with containment programmes for others STDs."
512,0.01,2.0000,"This study was designed to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in veterans. Anti-HCV testing was performed in 1,032 patients and a questionnaire regarding sociodemographic characteristics and potential risk factors was administered. Adjusted prevalence of unique HCV-positive patients using outpatient services was 17.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.2%, 18.2%). The following risk factors were associated with HCV infection: a history of injection drug use (IDU), receipt of blood transfusion prior to 1992, history of tattoo (odds ratio [OR], 2.93; 95% CI, 1.70-5.08), combat job as a medical worker (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.25-5.60), history of incarceration over 48 hours (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.52-4.32), greater than 15 lifetime sexual partners (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.94-2.76) and sexual relations with a prostitute (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.82). We concluded that HCV is common in veterans. Risk factors independently associated with infection are IDU, prior transfusion, prior tattoo, combat medical work, incarceration, and multiple opposite sex partners. Infection with HCV among veterans is strongly associated with traditional risk factors for infection and less strongly associated with combat-related risk."
8636,0.01,2.0000,"With the aim to characterize the HCV genotype distribution in Cuba, sera were collected from two subgroups: HCV-monoinfected and HCV/HIV co-infected patients. A combination of reverse transcription-PCR using genotype-specific primers, restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing was used to determine the genotype of 84 samples. Seventy-nine (94%) showed single infections (10 [12%] were genotype 1a and 69 [82%] genotype 1b) and 5 (6%) samples corresponded to mixed infections (2 [2%] with genotypes 1a/3a and 1 sample [1%] each with 1b/3a, 1b/4a and 1a/1b/3a). HCV/HIV co-infected subjects had a higher frequency of mixed infections (p=0.08), infection with genotype 3a (p=0.18) and for the first time genotype 4a was found. There was no association of any demographic characteristics with any specific genotype although HCV/HIV co-infected patients showed a tendency to have mixed genotypes in those older than 45 years of age (p=0.11). Phylogenetic analysis showed that HCV isolates clustered with subtypes 1b (n=15, maximal genetic distance 2.51%) and 1a (n=2, maximal genetic distance 0.35%). This report presents the prevalence of HCV genotypes in monoinfected and HIV co-infected patients, mixed HCV infections in HCV/HIV co-infected men who have sex with men with high-risk sexual practices and for the first time identifies that the uncommon genotype 4a can be present in a patient co-infected with HIV."

A total of 200 HIV-positive MSM participants were recruited using ""snowball"" sampling. Participants were tested for syphilis and completed a one-time questionnaire which included demographic characteristics, sexual behaviours with male and female sexual partners, substance use, and use of antiretroviral medications. Prevalence of syphilis infection was 16.5%. Among HIV/syphilis co-infected participants, 63.6% reported having anal sex with male partners and 24.2% did not use condoms consistently during the past six months; 66.7% reported having oral sex with male partners and 51.5% reported unprotected oral sex during the past six months. Factors associated with testing seropositive for syphilis infection included receptive anal sex with a male partner in the past six months (AOR = 12.61, 90% CI = 2.38-66.89), illicit drug use in the past six months (AOR = 11.47, 90% CI = 2.47-53.45), and use of antiretroviral medication (AOR = 4.48, 90% CI = 1.43-14.05). These data indicate a need for ""positive prevention"" interventions targeting HIV-positive MSM in China."
2037,0.01,2.0000,"Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is being acquired undetected among HIV-infected individuals. A practical way to regularly screen HIV-infected patients for acute HCV irrespective of perceived risk or symptoms is needed. We piloted implementation of an acute HCV screening strategy using routine HIV clinical care schedules and the least costly blood tests, in a Rhode Island HIV care center. Study participants had ongoing HCV risk, completed questionnaires encompassing risk behaviors and perception of risk, and were screened with quarterly alanine aminotransferase (ALT). ALT rise triggered HCV RNA testing, with pooled rather than individual specimen HCV RNA testing for underinsured participants. Participants were primarily older, college-educated men who have sex with men (MSM) with history of sexually transmitted infection other than HIV. One of 58 participants developed acute HCV in 50 person-years of observation for an annual incidence of 2.0% per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05-11.1%). The majority (54%) of MSM did not perceive that traumatic sexual and drug practices they were engaging in put them at risk for HCV. Unprotected sex often occurred under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Self-reported HCV risk and participation in several risk behaviors declined during the study. It was possible to collect frequent ALTs in a busy HIV clinic with 71% of total projected ALTs obtained and 88% of participants having at least one ALT during the 9-month follow-up period. All instances of ALT rise led to reflexive HCV RNA testing. Tracking quarterly ALT for elevation to systematically prompt HCV RNA testing before seroconversion is a promising approach to screen for acute HCV in a real-world HIV clinical setting."
13255,0.01,2.0000,"Describe the prevalence and covariates of viral suppression and subsequent rebound among younger (≤29 years old) compared with older adults.A retrospective clinical cohort study; eligibility criteria: documented HIV infection; resident of Canada; 18 years and over; first antiretroviral regimen comprised of at least 3 individual agents on or after January 1, 2000.Viral suppression and rebound were defined by at least 2 consecutive viral load measurements <50 or >50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL, respectively, at least 30 days apart, in a 1-year period. Time to suppression and rebound were measured using the Kaplan-Meier method and Life Table estimates. Accelerated failure time models were used to determine factors independently associated with suppression and rebound.Younger adults experienced lower prevalence of viral suppression and shorter time to viral rebound compared with older adults. For younger adults, viral suppression was associated with being male and later era of combination antiretroviral initiation (cART) initiation. Viral rebound was associated with a history of injection drug use, Indigenous ancestry, baseline CD4 cell count >200, and initiating cART with a protease inhibitor (PI) containing regimen.The influence of age on viral suppression and rebound was modest for this cohort. Our analysis revealed that key covariates of viral suppression and rebound for young adults in Canada are similar to those of known importance to older adults. Women, people who use injection drugs, and people with Indigenous ancestry could be targeted by future health interventions."
6619,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is silently becoming a major public health problem. Currently, no validated HCV knowledge measures exist. This study aimed to develop and validate a brief measure to assess general knowledge about HCV risk factors, modes of transmissions, and treatment options. A total of 406 individuals participated in this cross-sectional study. All participants completed the proposed 19-item Brief HCV Knowledge Scale. Participants were: HCV mono-infected patients (n = 83), HCV-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infected patients (n = 24), HIV mono-infected patients (n = 128) community healthcare workers (n = 89), and college students (n = 82). Two-week test-retest data were collected for the college student sample. Psychometric evaluation of the proposed scale demonstrated high levels of validity (content and construct validity) and reliability (internal consistency and retest stability). Factor analysis indicated a one-factor solution, which accounted for 49% of the variance. HCV knowledge was positively correlated with length of time since HCV diagnosis (r = 0.29, p < 0.05). HCV treatment-experienced patients obtained significantly higher HCV knowledge scores (82% correct) than HCV treatment-naïve patients (72% correct) (p < 0.05). HCV knowledge in College students (43% correct) and HIV patients (54% correct) was significantly lower than in HCV patients (77% correct) and community healthcare workers (80% correct) (p < 0.001). Community workers' HCV knowledge was positively correlated with years of HCV work experience (r = 0.30, p < 0.01). This self-administered Brief HCV Knowledge scale has high levels of validity and reliability across patient, healthcare provider and college student populations. It has valuable applications as a clinical teaching tool with patients and healthcare providers and could be used as an outcome indicator in novel HCV educational intervention studies."
13914,0.01,2.0000,"The Brazilian public health system has implemented free, universal access to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy for HIV-infected patients. To evaluate this system, we performed a pilot study to determine whether ARVs were prescribed according to Brazilian guidelines in place in 2000, and whether prescriptions were refilled in a timely manner. Year 2000 data were abstracted from all medical and pharmacy records of adult patients first registered for HIV/AIDS care in a Rio de Janeiro public clinic from January to June 2000 (n = 67). Results were analysed using frequency analyses, chi-square tests and logistic regression. The patient sample was 41.8% female and had a mean age of 34.9 years. 54 (81%) had AIDS; total sample mean baseline CD4+/viral counts were 276 cells/mm3 and 237 517 copies per millilitre, respectively. Delays between clinic request and receipt of first CD4+/viral load results ranged from 25 to 107 (mean 66) and 33 to 139 (mean 86) days, respectively. Fifty-nine patients (88.1%) were prescribed ARV treatment. Forty-two regimens (71.2%) were highly active antiretroviral therapies; 17 (28.8%) were combination regimens with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. No combinations were prescribed that were contraindicated in Brazilian guidelines, however 33 patients (55.9%) were prescribed ARV drugs before one or both HIV status parameters (initial CD4+ level or viral load) were recorded. Fourteen patients prescribed ARVs (23.7%) lacked a supply of medication for >1 month during the year at least once. Of these patients, 11 had treatment lapses as a result of failure to pick up medications, and three lacked medication because of drug shortages. Medication lapses were associated with female sex, being hospitalized in 2000, and having more than two drugs in regimen, but were not associated with age, CD4+ level or use of ARVs before 2000. The results from this pilot study suggest conservative prescription of HAART, high practitioner adherence to guidelines, and some problems with refilling medications in a timely manner. Monitoring delays were identified as a structural limitation to optimal adherence to practice guidelines. Better access to monitoring-laboratory facilities and greater drug availability would improve programme success."
6398,0.01,2.0000,"Children and adolescents with HIV-1 infection and elevated viral loads are at risk for disease progression. When outpatient adherence efforts fail to reduce viral loads, we have chosen to hospitalize patients for directly observed antiretroviral therapy. A retrospective chart review was performed for patients who were admitted for adherence concerns to a rehabilitation facility from December 1, 2000 to December 1, 2003. Differences in CD4 count and viral load at admission, prior to discharge and 6 months after discharge were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. Nineteen admissions were included in the analysis. Compared to the mean CD4 count at admission (262), the mean CD4 counts at discharge (492) and 6 months after discharge (429) were significantly higher (p < 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively). Similar results were observed for change in CD4 percentage. Compared to the mean viral load at admission (log 5.7), the mean viral loads at discharge (log 4.7) and 6 months after discharge (log 5) were significantly lower (p < 0.001 and p < 0.004). The majority of admissions (74%) involved a change in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen. In conclusion, hospitalization for directly observed therapy of HIV-1-infected children and adolescents with elevated viral loads and nonadherence resulted in an immediate and sustained (up to 6 months) reduction in viral load and increase in CD4 count."
5655,0.01,2.0000,"More than 75 million people worldwide have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and there are now approximately 37 million individuals living with the infection. Untreated HIV replication causes progressive CD4(+) T cell loss and a wide range of immunological abnormalities, leading to an increased risk of infectious and oncological complications. HIV infection also contributes to cardiovascular disease, bone disease, renal and hepatic dysfunction and several other common morbidities. Antiretroviral drugs are highly effective at inhibiting HIV replication, and for individuals who can access and adhere to these drugs, combination antiretroviral therapy leads to durable (and probably lifelong) suppression of viral replication. Viral suppression enables immune recovery and the near elimination of the risk for developing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Despite effective treatment, HIV-infected individuals have a higher than expected risk of heart, bone, liver, kidney and neurological disease. When used optimally by an infected (or by an uninfected) person, antiretroviral drugs can virtually eliminate the risk of HIV transmission. Despite major advances in prevention sciences, HIV transmission remains common in many vulnerable populations, including men who have sex with men, injection drug users and sex workers. Owing to a lack of widespread HIV testing and the costs and toxicities associated with antiretroviral drugs, the majority of the infected population is not on effective antiretroviral therapy. To reverse the pandemic, improved prevention, treatment and implementation approaches are necessary."
13544,0.01,2.0000,"Persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is characterized by a weak adaptive immune response, which is considered to be due to an imbalance of T helper cell types 1 and 2 (Th1/Th2). Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family members, particularly SOCS1 and SOCS3, have been demonstrated to be important in the regulation of T cell differentiation. Previous studies by our group showed that the expressed and purified fusion protein of cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP) and HBV core antigen 18‑27 (HBcAg18‑27)‑tapasin was able to enter the cytoplasm of bone marrow‑derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), promoting the maturation of BMDCs and efficiently enhancing T cell immune responses in vitro. In the present study, HBcAg‑specific immune responses induced by CTP‑HBcAg18‑27‑tapasin in HBV were assessed in transgenic mice, and SOCS1 and SOCS3 were identified as negative regulators of this response. The Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio was analyzed by ELISA. The expression of T cell‑specific T‑box transcription factor (T‑bet) and GATA‑binding protein 3 (GATA‑3), SOCS1 and SOCS3 were detected by real‑time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that CTP‑HBcAg18‑27‑tapasin significantly increased the Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio in HBV transgenic mice. CTP‑HBcAg18‑27‑tapasin immunization more efficiently suppressed the expression of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HBV DNA as well as liver HBsAg and HBcAg in HBV transgenic mice. Furthermore, CTP‑HBcAg18‑27‑tapasin promotes T‑bet but reduces GATA‑3 expression. In addition, the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 was significantly downregulated in the CTP‑HBcAg18‑27‑tapasin group compared with the control groups. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that CTP‑HBcAg18‑27‑tapasin enhanced the Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio and antiviral immunity by suppressing SOCS1/3 in HBV transgenic mice."
16008,0.01,2.0000,"Use of alcohol and illicit drugs is a common finding among HIV-infected individuals, but there are many open questions about its impact on adherence to antiretroviral therapy and virological outcomes. Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of the use of alcohol and illicit drugs on the adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among patients starting ART in Salvador, Brazil. We followed up 144 AIDS patients initiating ART for a 6-month period. At baseline, they were interviewed about demographics, behavior, and use of illicit drugs and alcohol. All of them had HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load and CD4(+)/CD8(+) cells count measured before starting therapy. After 60 days of treatment they were asked to answer a new questionnaire on adherence to ART. All patients were monitored during the following months, and new CD4(+) cell count/HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load determinations were performed after 6 months of therapy. Optimal adherence to therapy was defined by self-reported questionnaire, by 95% use of prescribed drug doses, and by using plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load as a biological marker. A total of 61 (42.4%) patients reported alcohol use, 7 (4.9%) used illicit drugs, and 17 (11.8%) used both alcohol and illicit drugs. Being in a steady relationship was protective to nonadherence (95% CI: 0.18-0.84). Missing more than two medical visits was also associated with a 68% higher likelihood of nonadherence (95% CI: 0.10-1.02). After logistic regression we detected a higher risk of nonadherence for patients declaring use of alcohol plus illicit drugs (odds ratio=6.0; 95% CI: 1.78-20.28) or high-intensity use of alcohol (odds ratio=3.29; 95% CI: 1.83-5.92). AIDS patients using alcohol and/or illicit drugs are socially vulnerable, and need specific and flexible programs, combining mental health care, harm reduction strategies, and assisted drug therapy to maximize the chances of successful use of ART."
15669,0.01,2.0000,"A random, stratified sample of 2601 adult Australians from all states and territories was interviewed about knowledge of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). After the interview, an anonymous questionnaire on the prevalence of practices that are associated with risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was left with the respondents; 60.2% of these questionnaires were returned. Data from this survey suggest that the prevalences of male homosexual behaviour, prostitute contact and lesbian contact are substantially lower than were estimated previously. Men with homosexual experience were significantly more prevalent in the more populous states, but the majority of other risk factors--intravenous drug abuse, male respondents' contact with prostitutes, transfusion of blood or blood products during 1980-1985 and heterosexual contact--showed few significant associations with geographical, occupational or marital status. Intravenous drug abusers were significantly younger, and heterosexual contact was associated with age for both male and female respondents. No significant differences were found in the prevalence of homosexual contact among single, married and previously-married men, although the prevalence of homosexual contact was lower in married men. The results of the study are discussed in terms of targeting preventive campaigns and assessing the future potential for the spread of HIV infection."

Prevalence of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) infection was 3.1% (31 of 1,006), a tenfold rise in seroprevalence in 4.5 years. Nineteen of 517 (3.7%) heterosexual men, 3 of 5 (60%) homosexual/bisexual men, and 9 of 484 (1.9%) women were infected with HIV. In heterosexual men, factors associated with HIV infection after age adjustment included present complaint of genital ulcer [odds ratio (OR) 7.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-72], past history of genital ulcer (OR, 4.3; CI, 1.4-12), positive MHATP syphilis serology (OR, 3.4; CI, 1.1-10), sex with a prostitute in the past month (OR, 3.8; CI, 1.1-11).

Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the env and pol fragment sequences amplified from these specimens. The BED IgG capture incidence EIA (BED-CEIA assay) was used to determine recent infections. Among the 683 HIV-1-positive individuals enrolled between 2007 and 2009, 394 (57.7%) were subtype B, 260 (38.1%) were CRF07_BC, 26 (3.8%) were CRF01_AE, two (0.3%) were CRF08_BC, and one (0.1%) was CRF06_cpx. While the percentage of CRF07_BC decreased (58.5-17.9%, p < 0.001) from 2007 to 2009, the percentage of subtype B increased (37.6% to 74.9%, p < 0.001). A concordant decrease in the proportion of recent infections to new infections among IDUs (63.6% to 9.8%, p < 0.001), accompanied with an increase of the proportion of recent infections in MSM (men having sex with men) (22.4-67.1%, p = 0.77) and heterosexual groups (13.1- 23.2%, p = 0.852), was observed. The decrease in CRF07_BC infections and the reduction in the proportion of recent infections among IDUs reflected the success of harm reduction strategies initiated by the government in 2005."
2618,0.01,2.0000,"Abnormalities in hepatic function have become one of the most common complications occurring among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and liver disease has become an increasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients. We present a case of a patient with HIV infection and hepatotoxicity that exemplifies the complications currently observed during the treatment of such patients. Hepatotoxicity can be a result of several factors, including a direct effect of HAART, substance abuse, and coinfection with either hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus. Imaging studies may be helpful in determining the etiology; however, a liver biopsy is often necessary to be able to more accurately determine the relative contributions of different processes. Although coinfection with HCV and HIV has become a common clinical problem, optimal treatment of such patients remains to be defined and must be individualized to maximize benefit and tolerance."
111,0.01,2.0000,"Although suppression of HIV-1 RNA below the limit of detection is associated with optimal outcomes, many patients can maintain or increase their CD4(+) count for prolonged time periods in the presence of persistent low-level viremia. We followed seven patients with prolonged (>5 years) discordant CD4(+)/viral load (VL) responses on protease inhibitor (PI)-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) prospectively for 1 year to assess evolution of immune function, viral phenotype, replication capacity (RC), and resistance profile. Immune function was assessed by qualitative and quantitative measurement of cellular activation (CD38(+)HLA-DR(+) and CD38 antibodies bound per cell), and the interferon (IFN)-() ELISpot assay. Presence of syncytium-inducing (SI) or nonsyncytium-inducing (NSI) viral strains was determined by MT-2 cell culture. RC was measured by a modified rapid recombinant virus assay. The resistance profile was characterized by both genotypic and phenotypic analysis. Over the year of follow-up, IFN-() production to gag persisted, responses to other HIV antigens increased, and markers of cellular activation did not change. NSI virus predominated. The genotypic (GSS) and phenotypic (PSS) susceptibility scores remained stable. Evolution of RC was variable over the year of follow-up, but the RC of viruses remained well below that of wild-type clinical isolates. Thus, CD4(+)/VL discordance can be maintained for periods exceeding 5 years in some patients receiving PI-based HAART without significant evolution of HIV resistance."

However, the proportion of patients eligible for treatment, especially among those coinfected with HIV, is not well known. Our aim was to determine and compare the rates for HCV treatment eligibility among HCV and HCV-HIV-coinfected persons. We assembled a national cohort of HCV-infected veterans in care from 1998-2003, using the VA National Patient Care Database for demographic/clinical information, the Pharmacy Benefits Management database for pharmacy records, and the Decision Support Systems database for laboratory data. We compared the HCV-monoinfected and HCV-HIV-coinfected subjects for treatment indications and eligibility using current treatment guidelines. Of the 27,452 subjects with HCV and 1225 with HCV-HIV coinfection, 74.0% and 84.6% had indications for therapy and among these, 43.9% of HCV-monoinfected and 28.4% of HCV-HIV-coinfected subjects were eligible for treatment. Anemia, decompensated liver disease (DLD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recent alcohol abuse, and coronary artery disease were the most common contraindications in the HCV, and anemia, DLD, renal failure, recent drug abuse, and COPD in the HCV-HIV-coinfected group. Among those eligible for treatment, only 23% of the HCV-monoinfected and 15% of the HCV-HIV-coinfected subjects received any treatment for HCV. Most veterans with HCV are not eligible for treatment according to the current guidelines. Even for those who are eligible for treatment, only a minority is prescribed treatment. Several contraindications are modifiable and aggressive management of those may improve treatment prescription rates."
9663,0.01,2.0000,"Treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has revolutionized care of patients with HIV infection. The cost of increased survival has been antiretroviral toxicity and increasing age-related co-morbidities that include significant metabolic issues. Hypogonadism was first described in the setting of advanced AIDS and can be primary or secondary. Data regarding treatment largely concern patients with wasting. Varied syndromes involving bone have been described in patients with HIV including osteonecrosis, low bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis, and rarely osteomalacia. Low BMD leading to osteoporosis is the most common bone pathology and may be as a result of HIV infection, drug toxicity or co-morbidities. However, increasingly fragility fractures are reported in HIV-infected patients, suggesting bone demineralization in this population is of clinical relevance. Further research is required to understand its pathogenesis and determine effective management; however, initiation of antiretroviral therapy seems to accelerate (in the short-term) bone demineralization. One particular antiretroviral agent, tenofovir is widely used and is potentially implicated as having a greater role in long-term bone and renal dysfunction. As this population ages, screening for low BMD will become increasingly more important."
13115,0.01,2.0000,"Previous studies have established the existence of CD4-independent simian immunodeficiency virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2), and laboratory strains of HIV-1. However, whether CD4-independent viruses may also exist in HIV-1-infected patients has remained unclear. We have recently reported the isolation of viruses from an AIDS patient that were able to infect CD8(+) cells independent of CD4, using CD8 as a receptor. Using a similar approach, here we examined viruses from 12 randomly selected patients (obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Program, National Institutes of Health) for the presence of CD4-independent HIV-1. CD4-independent variants were isolated from infected CD8(+) cells from the viral quasispecies of 7 of 12 patients. The CD4-independent isolates were able to infect primary CD8(+) cells as well as a CD4(-) CD8(+) T-cell line. Soluble CD4 and blocking anti-CD4 or -CD8 antibody had no effect on infection of CD8(+) cells. Remarkably, two of the seven CD4-independent isolates, but not their parental bulk viruses, induced syncytia and caused acute death of infected CD8(+) cells. Some of the CD4-independent variants were also able to infect U87 cells that were negative for CD4, CD8, and common HIV coreceptors, suggesting a novel entry mechanism for these isolates. The CD4-independent isolates were derived from adults and children infected with subtypes A, B, and D. Although no common motif for CD4 independence was found, novel sequence changes were observed in critical areas of the envelopes of the CD4-independent viruses. These results demonstrate that HIV-1-infected patients can frequently harbor viruses that are able to mediate CD4-independent infection of CD8(+) cells. In addition, this study also provides evidence of primary HIV-1 variants that are syncytium inducing and acutely cytopathic for CD8(+) lymphocytes."
17489,0.01,2.0000,"Sub-Saharan Africa, which has about 12% of the global population, is home to almost 70% of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). A recent survey by the Ugandan Ministry of Health has found the HIV prevalence rate to be approximately 7% in sexually active adults. The predominant HIV subtypes present in Uganda are A and D. Health care resources are well planned but often lack human and fiscal resources. Uganda has adopted the World Health Organization (WHO) ""3 by 5"" global strategy for the introduction of antiretroviral therapy and has surpassed the target. Neurological complications of the HIV virus are common and often have devastating consequences. A recent study in Kampala found the rate of HIV dementia and peripheral neuropathy at 31% and 47%, respectively. Further studies are urgently required to determine the natural history and treatment outcomes of both these common HIV complications."
13534,0.01,2.0000,"Even in cases where viral replication has been controlled by antiretroviral therapy for long periods of time, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients have several non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) related co-morbidities, including liver disease, cardiovascular disease and neurocognitive decline, which have a clear impact on survival. It has been considered that persistent innate and acquired immune activation contributes to the pathogenesis of these non-AIDS related diseases. Immune activation has been related with several conditions, remarkably with the bacterial translocation related with the intestinal barrier damage by the HIV or by hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver cirrhosis. Consequently, increased morbidity and mortality must be expected in HIV-HCV coinfected patients. Disrupted gut barrier lead to an increased passage of microbial products and to an activation of the mucosal immune system and secretion of inflammatory mediators, which in turn might increase barrier dysfunction. In the present review, the intestinal barrier structure, measures of intestinal barrier dysfunction and the modifications of them in HIV monoinfection and in HIV-HCV coinfection will be considered. Both pathogenesis and the consequences for the progression of liver disease secondary to gut microbial fragment leakage and immune activation will be assessed. "
2612,0.01,2.0000,"To determine whether a 48-week course of amprenavir-based antiretroviral therapy is associated with metabolic alterations, 14 clinically stable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected, protease inhibitor-naive adults initiated amprenavir-based triple therapy. Twelve subjects (86%) achieved HIV RNA levels of <400 copies/mL at week 24. Fasting glucose and insulin levels did not change. Insulin sensitivity did not decrease in the first 24 weeks, but a trend toward a decrease appeared at week 48. Six subjects experienced onset or worsening of glucose tolerance by week 24. Levels of fasting triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol increased. Bone mineral content, lean tissue, total fat, trunk fat, limb fat, and the ratio of trunk to limb fat increased at week 48. Amprenavir-based therapy was associated with increases in serum lipid levels but no short-term decrease in insulin sensitivity. A trend toward insulin resistance appeared late in the study following weight gain, particularly of trunk fat, but without loss of limb fat."
19106,0.01,2.0000,"In Botswana, there is dearth of literature on the role of nursing in health-care policy and resource allocation and yet nurses constitute the majority (85%) of health manpower. The health-care delivery system depends mostly on nurses for service provision. There were two main purposes of this study: first, to gather descriptive data from major key players (with particular emphasis on nurses) concerning knowledge of the policy process and resource allocation for management and care of clients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Botswana; and, second, to identify nurse characteristics (e.g. position, education, experience, job category) associated with motivation to influence health-care policy in HIV/AIDS management and care in Botswana. A policy process conceptual framework was used to guide data collection and analysis. A case-study research method was used to conduct in-depth interviews from a purposive sample of 19 policy makers, and a survey questionnaire was used to collect data from a purposive sample of 95 registered nurses from six study sites in Botswana. The study findings indicate minimal participation of nurses in health-care policy process and resource allocation. The demographic variable of position was a predictor of the involvement of nurses in policy and in budgetary decisions. Both survey and interview data indicated that this minimal participation of nurses in the policy process resulted in implementation problems, thus compromising service provision. Implications of the findings for the nursing profession, nursing practice and policy, which address the importance of nurses' involvement, are discussed."
10770,0.01,2.0000,"The objective of this study was to identify the factors that influence adherence to antiretroviral medication regimens in culturally diverse populations with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) related to age, ethnicity, and intravenous drug use. The critical incident technique was used to identify factors determining adherence. Through a series of brief, focused interviews, patients were asked to recall specific incidents that affected their adherence to HIV medications. Patients' responses were grouped into categories using Ethnograph software. Two nurse experts, with 94% agreement, determined the reliability of the category listings. A chi(2) analysis compared the proportion of patients reporting each factor across age, ethnicity, and intravenous drug use categories. The total sample of 52 participants included 46 male outpatients with HIV/AIDS receiving care through a Veteran's Administration Hospital in northern California and 6 health care providers. The interviews yielded a total of 294 incidents. Six major categories were identified, and a taxonomy of critical factors determining highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) adherence was developed. The categories included reminders and cues (30%), planning (18%), response to HIV/AIDS (17%), HIV medication characteristics (14%), interactions with others (12%), and patient characteristics (10%). The two largest categories representing patient-related factors accounted for nearly half of the incidents. Patients most influenced by positive support from others included non-Caucasians, those under the age of 50 years, and those with fewer years of education. The taxonomy of adherence behaviors provides important information for developing culturally relevant patient adherence education programs and an essential foundation for developing future studies."
2993,0.01,2.0000,"Although the number of patients receiving antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in Central China is expanding, little is known about their medication adherence. The purpose of this study was to: (1) describe adherence prevalence among patients receiving free ARV in south central China; (2) identify factors associated with adherence; (3) compare 3 self-report measures of adherence in this population. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at seven free treatment sites in Hunan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces. Adherence measures included direct questioning regarding the number of doses taken in the 7 days prior to interview, the Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA) Adherence Self-Report questionnaire, and a 7-day visual analogue scale. Subjects comprised all patients returning for monthly ARV follow-up at each site between April and July 2006. Among the 308 subjects, 244 (79%) lived in the countryside. One hundred seventy (55%) had been on ARV over 1 year. No regimen included a protease inhibitor. Two hundred forty-four (80%) reported taking more than 90% of prescribed doses in the previous 7 days. Sixty-four (20%) subjects reported missing at least 1 dose in that period. The three measures of self-reported adherence were highly correlated. On multivariate analysis, current heroin use (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1,6, p = 0.05) and nonuse of reminders such as cell phone alarms, wall charts, or TV programs (OR 6; 95% CI 3, 11; p = 0.001) were associated with 90% or less adherence. Adherence to ARV in Central China is similar to elsewhere in the world. The 20% of subjects who reported taking 90% or fewer doses are of concern in view of the potential for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance and lack of protease inhibitor back-up regimens. Substance abuse treatment will be an essential element of successful AIDS treatment in China. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of reminder devices to improve adherence in this population and to describe the prevalence and incidence of ARV resistance."
2023,0.01,2.0000,"Ensuring completion of tuberculosis (TB) treatment remains a major public health problem. In HIV-infected patients, TB is the most common severe opportunistic infection. Few studies have evaluated risk factors for TB treatment default in HIV-infected patients. We conducted a prospective, observational study of HIV-infected TB patients in Thailand. Patients underwent standardised evaluations at the beginning of TB treatment, at the end of the intensive phase and at the end of TB treatment. TB treatment outcomes were assessed according to WHO guidelines. The analysis was limited to patients who defaulted or who had treatment success. Of the 554 patients analysed, 61 (11%) defaulted. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with TB treatment default included incarceration history [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.7), smoking (AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-4.1) and having a symptom complaint score >15 (AOR 3.4, 95% CI 1.4-8.0); one marker of wealth, namely owning a refrigerator, was protective (AOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8). Default during TB treatment was a significant problem in HIV-infected patients. Reducing default may require enhancing services for patients with a history of incarceration or smoking and designing patient-centred systems to address poverty and patient wellness."
10995,0.01,2.0000,"This study aimed to estimate the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) and associated factors in an outpatient cohort of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) followed between October 2009 and July 2011. We evaluated nausea and/or vomiting, dyspepsia, heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, and flatulence. The outcome variable was the presence of three or more GIS. Sociodemographic (sex, skin color, age, income, years of schooling), lifestyle (smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity level), clinical (antiretroviral therapy, time of HIV infection, CD4 lymphocyte count, viral load), and anthropometric (nutritional status and waist circumference) variables were investigated. Data on sociodemographic and lifestyle variables were collected through a pre-tested and standardized questionnaire. CD4 count was determined by flow cytometry and viral load by branched DNA (bDNA) assays for HIV-1. All variables were analyzed at a p<0.05 significance level. Among 290 patients, the incidence of three or more GIS was 28.8% (95% CI 23.17 to 33.84) and 74.48% presented at least one symptom. Female gender (IR 2.29, 95% CI 1.63 to 3.22) and smoking status (IR 1.93, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.88) were risk factors for the presence of three or more GIS after multivariate Poisson regression. A high incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms was found among PLWHA, and it was significantly associated with female sex and tobacco use. Those results reinforce the relevance of investigating the presence of GIS in PLWHA as it may affect treatment adherence."
4533,0.01,2.0000,"To characterize survival and to compare rates of disease progression to death of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, between those initiating multiple-drug rescue therapy (MDRT) and those antiretroviral-inexperienced initiating triple-drug antiretroviral therapy (ART), we conducted a population-based analysis of HIV-infected men and women aged > or =18 years in British Columbia, Canada. Cumulative mortality rates were estimated by use of Kaplan-Meier methods, and Cox-proportional hazard regression was used to model the simultaneous effect of prognostic variables on survival. Cumulative mortality at 36 months was 14.2%+/-2.0% and 10.9%+/-1.0% for the MDRT and triple-drug ART groups, respectively (P=.105, log-rank test). After adjustment for other baseline prognostic variables, MDRT was found not to be a predictor of increased all-cause mortality (relative risk, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-1.66) in multivariate analysis. Over the short-term, patients receiving MDRT had relatively low mortality. After adjustment for baseline prognostic factors, rates of survival were comparable with those in patients initiating triple-drug ART."
16203,0.01,2.0000,"Viral hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are important causes of mortality and morbidity in patients treated by haemodialysis (HD). Both are further promoted by the characteristic immunological dysfunction that develops in renal failure and interferes with the patient's ability to eliminate these viruses. The hepatotropic viruses A through G remain the causative agents in 60 to 80% of hepatitis. But, as far as HD is concerned, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the two most important organisms responsible for almost all the patients' morbidity. In HD, both patients as well as staff are at a high risk of acquiring hepatitis B infection. The prevalence of HBV in the dialysis population in India is reported to range between 3.4% and 42%. The acute course of the infection is often anicteric and peak transaminase concentration is significantly less than in patients with normal renal function. Up to 60% of dialysis patients with HBV infection develop chronic hepatitis with persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and infectivity. The risk of transmission of HBV infection due to blood from one patient to another is mostly because of inadequate precautions taken by the dialysis staff. Combined therapy with interferon (6-10 million units) three times a week and lamivudine (100-300 mg/day) would be more effective in controlling viral replication. The most important modality for prevention of HBV infection is induction of immunity by hepatitis B vaccination. Administration of 40 microg doses at months 0, 1, 2 and 6 is the most rapid immunogenic schedule. The prevalence of HCV in HD patients ranges from 6% in the United Kingdom to 60% in Poland and Eastern Europe, 8-36% in North America. HD patients in different parts of India exhibit high anti-HCV positivity (12.1%, 45.2%, 33.3% and 41.9%) in various studies. The incidence and prevalence of HCV infection among patients on dialysis in developed countries are steadily declining because of (i) reduction in post-transfusion HCV infection, (ii) infection control measures to prevent nosocomial infection. Among HD patients with HCV infection, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) levels are elevated in only 4 to 67% patients who are positive for anti-HCV, in only 12 to 31% patients with HCV RNA and only in one-third of those with biopsy proven hepatitis. Number of blood transfusion, duration of HD treatment, and mode of dialysis are important risk factors. Patient to patient transmission of HCV occurs in HD units by needle stick injury, breakdown in standard infection control practices, physical proximity to an infected patient, dialysis machines, dialysis membranes and HD ultrafiltrate and reprocessing of dialyser. The prevalence of HIV infection in dialysis populations varies according to different countries and geographic areas, 0% and 13% in 1990 and 1995 respectively. There was no evidence of transmission within the centre transmission, from patient to patient or patient to staff. Antiretroviral therapy is the corner-stone of the HIV infection in end stage renal disease (ESRD). Most commonly, zidovudine (AZT) has been used in these patients. Currently recommended dose of 200 mg three times a day is probably safe in these patients."
1399,0.01,2.0000,"Fat redistribution in the setting of protease inhibitor use is increasingly common and is associated with insulin resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. However, little is known regarding the factors that may contribute to abnormal insulin regulation in this population. We assessed fasting insulin levels in HIV-infected men and determined the relationship among insulin, body composition, endogenous gonadal steroid concentrations, and antiviral therapy in this population. We also determined the effects of exogenous testosterone administration using the homeostatic model for insulin resistance (HOMA IR) in hypogonadal HIV-infected men with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome wasting syndrome. Fifty HIV-infected men with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome wasting were compared with 20 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy control subjects. Insulin concentrations were significantly increased in HIV-infected patients compared to those in control patients (16.6+/-1.8 vs. 10.4+/-0.8 microU/mL; P<0.05) and were increased in nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NRTI)-treated patients who did not receive a protease inhibitor (PI; 21.7+/-4.3 vs. 10.4+/-0.8 microU/mL; P<0.05). Insulin concentrations and HOMA IR were inversely correlated with the serum free testosterone concentration (r = -0.36; P = 0.01 for insulin level; r = -0.30; P = 0.03 for HOMA), but not to body composition parameters, age, or BMI. In a multivariate regression analysis, free testosterone (P = 0.05), BMI (P<0.01), and lean body mass (P = 0.04) were significant. Lower lean body mass and higher BMI predicted increased insulin resistance. The HIV-infected patients demonstrated an increased trunk fat to total fat ratio (0.49+/-0.02 vs. 0.45+/-0.02; P<0.05) and an increased trunk fat to extremity fat ratio (1.27+/-0.09 vs. 0.95+/-0.06, P = 0.01), but a reduced extremity fat to total fat ratio (0.44+/-0.01 vs. 0.49 + 0.01; P = 0.02) and reduced overall total body fat (13.8+/-0.7 vs. 17.2+/-0.9 kg; P<0.01) compared to the control subjects. Increased truncal fat and reduced extremity fat were seen among NRTI-treated patients, but this pattern was most severe among patients receiving combined NRTI and PI therapy [trunk fat to extremity ratio, 1.47+/-0.15 vs. 0.95+/-0.06 (P<0.01); extremity fat to total fat ratio, 0.40+/-0.02 vs. 0.49+/-0.01 (P<0.05)]. Insulin responses to testosterone administration were investigated among 52 HIV-infected men with hypogonadism and wasting (weight <90% ideal body weight and/or weight loss >10%) randomized to either testosterone (300 mg, im, every 3 weeks) or placebo for 6 months. Testosterone administration reduced HOMA IR in the HIV-infected men (-0.6+/-0.7 vs. +1.41+/-0.8, testosterone vs. placebo, P = 0.05) in association with increased lean body mass (P = 0.02). These data demonstrate significant hyperinsulinemia in HIV-infected patients, which can occur in the absence of PI use. In NRTI-treated patients not receiving PI, a precursor phenotype is apparent, with increased truncal fat, reduced extremity fat, and increased insulin concentrations. This phenotype is exaggerated in patients receiving PI therapy, with further increased truncal fat and reduced extremity fat, although hyperinsulinemia per se is not worse. Endogenous gonadal steroid levels are inversely related to hyperinsulinemia in HIV-infected men, but reduced lean body mass and increased weight are the primary independent predictors of hyperinsulinemia. Indexes of insulin sensitivity improve in response to physiological androgen administration among hypogonadal HIV-infected patients, and this change is again related primarily to increased lean body mass in response to testosterone administration."

The single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were evaluated following administration of tenofovir DF in treatment-experienced HIV-infected children requiring a change in antiretroviral therapy. Using increments of tenofovir DF 75-mg tablets, the target dose was 175 mg/m(2); the median administered dose was 208 mg/m(2). Single-dose pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 18 subjects, and the geometric mean area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC(0- infinity )) was 2,150 ng. h/ml and the geometric mean maximum concentration (C(max)) was 266 ng/ml. Subsequently, other antiretrovirals were added to each patient's regimen based upon treatment history and baseline viral resistance results. Steady-state pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 16 subjects at week 4. The steady-state, geometric mean AUC for the 24-h dosing interval was 2,920 ng. h/ml and was significantly higher than the AUC(0- infinity ) after the first dose (P = 0.0004). The geometric mean C(max) at steady state was 302 ng/ml. Tenofovir DF was generally very well tolerated. Steady-state tenofovir exposures in children receiving tenofovir DF-containing combination antiretroviral therapy approached values seen in HIV-infected adults (AUC, approximately 3,000 ng. h/ml; C(max), approximately 300 ng/ml) treated with tenofovir DF at 300 mg."

Fischer's discriminant analysis was applied to define functions capable of differentiating between the study groups (HCV, HCV/HTLV-1 and HCV/HTLV-2). The discriminant accuracy was evaluated by cross-validation. Alcohol consumption, use of intravenous drugs or inhaled cocaine and sexual partnership with intravenous drug users were more frequent in the HCV/HTLV-2 group, whereas patients in the HCV group more often reported abdominal pain or a sexual partner with hepatitis. Coinfected patients presented higher platelet counts, but aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels were higher among HCV-infected subjects. No significant difference between the groups was seen regarding liver histopathological findings. Through discriminant analysis, classification functions were defined, including sex, age group, intravenous drug use and sexual partner with hepatitis. Cross-validation revealed high discriminant accuracy for the HCV group."
15455,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-associated dementia is observed in 20-30% of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene currently is thought to play a role as a risk factor for the development of HIV dementia. The HIV protein Tat is neurotoxic and binds to the same receptor as apoE, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). In this study, we investigated the role apoE plays in Tat toxicity. Synaptosomes from wild-type mice treated with Tat had increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased lipid and protein oxidation, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Synaptosomes from APOE-knockout mice also had increased ROS, increased protein oxidation, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, but to a significantly lesser degree. Treatment of synaptosomes with heparinase and Tat increased Tat-induced oxidative stress, consistent with the notion of Tat requiring interaction with neuronal membranes to induce oxidative damage. Human lipidated apoE3 greatly protected neurons from Tat-induced toxicity, whereas human lipidated apoE4 showed no protection. We demonstrated that human apoE3 has antioxidant properties against Tat-induced toxicity. Taken together, the data suggest that murine apoE and human apoE4 act similarly and do not protect the cell from Tat-induced toxicity. This would allow excess Tat to remain outside the cell and interact with synaptosomal membranes, leading to oxidative stress and neurotoxicity, which could contribute to dementia associated with HIV. We show that the antioxidant properties of apoE3 greatly outweigh the competition for clearance in deterring Tat-induced oxidative stress."
15270,0.01,2.0000,"The experience with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of a private inner-city sexually transmissible diseases (STD) clinic in Sydney was quantified. Between February 1984 and March 1988, 2073 of the Clinic's patients were tested for antibodies to HIV on 5095 occasions. Of those tested, 538 (26%) were positive for antibodies to HIV: 532 (98.9%) of the seropositives had practised male homosexual intercourse. This is the highest reported seroprevalence of HIV for any primary care service in Australia. Those individuals seropositive because of other risk behaviours were detected by voluntary contact tracing rather than by screening. Female prostitution was not found to be a risk factor for HIV. In general, rates of first HIV antibody tests were adversely affected by threatening legislation, and temporarily stimulated (among lower-risk persons) by a national television campaign. These data suggest that much of the counselling, detection and management of HIV infection in Australia is occurring in private practice, and that STD services (private and public) are at the forefront of the HIV epidemic. This has implications for disease surveillance and control, health services planning and medical education."
630,0.01,2.0000,"We describe our experience at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida, with 172 children who were given diagnoses of perinatally acquired infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The 146 mothers of the children acquired HIV-1 through heterosexual contact (69 percent), intravenous drug use (30 percent), or blood transfusion (1 percent). The children presented with symptomatic disease at a median age of eight months; only 21 percent presented after the age of two years. The most common first manifestations of disease were lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (in 17 percent), encephalopathy (in 12 percent), recurrent bacterial infections (in 10 percent), and candida esophagitis (in 8 percent), for which the median survival times from diagnosis were 72, 11, 50, and 12 months, respectively. Nine percent of the children had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia at a median age of five months and had a median survival of only one month. The median survival for all 172 children was 38 months from the time of diagnosis. Mortality was highest in the first year of life (17 percent), and by proportional-hazard analysis the probability of long-term survival is low. In multivariate analyses, early age at diagnosis and the first identifiable pattern of clinical disease were found to be independently related to survival. We conclude that children with perinatally acquired HIV-1 infection have a very poor prognosis and that most become symptomatic before one year of age. Early diagnosis is important, since there is only a short interval in which to initiate prophylactic or antiviral treatment before progressive disease begins."
15147,0.01,2.0000,"Asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with impaired cognitive functioning in both clade B and C infections. The nature of cognitive change longitudinally has not been studied in asymptomatic clade C infection. The present study evaluated changes in neuropsychological functioning over a 2(1/2)-year period in a cohort of HIV-1 clade C-infected asymptomatic individuals from South India. Participants with CD4 counts below 250 were started on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as per National AIDS Control Organisation NACO guidelines and hence excluded. The sample consisted of 68 patients (30 men and 38 women), with a mean age of 29.4 years (SD=5.6 years) and a mean education of 10.0 years (SD=2.7 years). A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment with 12 tests yielding 21 variables was used to examine cognitive functioning at baseline and subsequently at 6-monthly intervals for five follow-ups. Shift in CD4 and viral load categories measured by the McNemar's test indicated disease progression. Latent growth curve (LGC) modeling assessed the nature of change in cognition over the 2(1/2)-year study period. Ten variables representing attention, executive functions, and long-term memory fit the LGC model. Excepting visual working memory, the slope was nonsignificant for nine variables, indicating absence of deterioration in cognition over a 2(1/2)-year period. However, CD4 and viral load levels worsened, indicating disease progression. Asymptomatic individuals with HIV-1 clade C infection do not show any significant decline on individual neuropsychological functions over 2(1/2) years despite disease progression, as evidenced by immune suppression and viral loads."
14778,0.01,2.0000,"The roles of cytokines in the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated disease are controversial. The patterns of innate cytokine production have been postulated to shift from TH1- to TH2-type cytokines with the progression of HIV-associated disease. Although there have been studies of cytokines in children and adults, no data are available on cytokine production in healthy or HIV-infected adolescents. We analyzed and characterized cytokine mRNA and protein levels for gamma interferon, interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, and tumor necrosis factor alpha and protein levels of IL-6 in both stimulated and unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from a large longitudinal, observational cohort study of HIV-seropositive and -seronegative adolescents. We correlated cytokine results with viral load and CD4(+)-T-cell counts as critical markers of disease progression in HIV-infected adolescents. These data were used to examine hypotheses related to the TH1-to-TH2 cytokine shift in a sample of HIV-infected adolescents. Five hundred twenty subjects participating in the REACH (Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and Health) Project of the Adolescent Medicine HIV/AIDS Research Network contributed blood samples. Samples selected for the cross-sectional data set analyzed had to meet selection criteria developed to minimize the potential confounding effects of acute intercurrent illnesses or infections, recent vaccination for hepatitis, and altered hormone status and to optimize congruence of cytokine measurements with assays of viral load and CD4(+)-T-cell counts. Group differences in the proportions of subjects with detectable levels of each cytokine marker were compared. In the subset of subjects with detectable cytokine values, differences in detected values were compared across subgroups defined by HIV serostatus and among HIV-seropositive subjects by three viral load classifications. The study sample was 65% HIV seropositive, 71% African-American, and 75% female with a mean age of 17.4 years. HIV-seropositive subjects were relatively healthy with mean and median CD4(+)-T-cell counts of 534 and 499 cells/mm(3), respectively. Only 8.1% of subjects had CD4(+)-T-cell counts below 200 cells/mm(3), and 25% had viral loads that were below the threshold of detection (<400 copies/ml). Detailed analyses of these data indicate that there were no differences in cytokines detected in HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative adolescents, and there was no apparent relationship between the cytokine measurements and the viral load or CD4(+)-T-cell categorization, the parameters selected as markers of HIV-associated disease status. These adolescents, including the HIV-seropositive subjects, were relatively healthy, and the HIV-infected subjects were at an early stage in the course of their HIV-associated disease. On the basis of our data, we conclude that, early in the course of HIV-associated disease in adolescents, there are no detectable shifts from TH1 to TH2 cytokine production."
2260,0.01,2.0000,"Insulin resistance (IR) is a common condition in chronic hepatitis C. Recent studies have reported that IR is associated with liver fibrosis progression in these patients. However, there is no information available on this issue in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients. For these reasons, we investigate the relationship between IR and liver fibrosis in patients with HIV and HCV infections. This was a cross-sectional study where patients from an Infectious Diseases Unit with HIV/HCV coinfection who underwent a liver biopsy, with available frozen sera samples at the time of biopsy and a known or estimated date of infection were included. IR was determined by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) method. The relationship between histological findings and several variables, including HOMA-IR values, was examined. Seventy-nine patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Age at HCV infection >21 years was the only variable independently associated with advanced liver fibrosis (stages F3 and F4) [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-11.3]. The variables associated with a fibrosis progression rate above the median were age at HCV infection >21 years (AOR 6.41; 95% CI 2.16-27.96) and previous exposure to nevirapine (AOR 8.9; 95% CI 2.01-39.36). There was no association between HOMA-IR values and the presence of advanced fibrosis or a faster fibrosis progression. Thus IR is not associated with liver damage or fibrosis progression in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals."
17865,0.01,2.0000,"During the last quarter of 1992, 984 patients from 13 dialysis centers in the Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur region in France participated in a multicenter cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence, the risk factors, and the clinical consequences of infection by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Serum samples were tested for anti-HCV antibodies using second-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the case of a positive result, a combination test was performed using second-generation recombinant immunoblot (RIBA) or direct detection of HCV-RNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Collected data included the patient's age, gender, cause of the kidney disease, type of dialysis treatment, number of years on dialysis, weekly dialysis time, drug addiction, co-infection with hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), number of kidney transplants, number of blood transfusions, and history of acute or chronic hepatitis. Chronic HCV infection was detected in 232 (23.6%) patients, whereas only 71 (7.2%) were infected by HBV. Logistic-regression analysis showed that HCV infection was associated with dialysis over a long period, numerous blood transfusions, female gender, kidney grafts, HBV infection, hemodialysis, and acute as well as chronic hepatitis. Multiple-correspondence analysis confirmed that the contamination was both transfusional and nosocomial. These results underscore the need for a strict compliance with ""universal precautions"" (Centers for Disease Control [CDC], Atlanta) in dialysis units and raise the question as to whether anti-HCV-positive patients should be isolated."
4840,0.01,2.0000,"Epidemiological studies investigating seroprevalence of vaccine preventable infections at both individual and population level are important in guiding screening and vaccination practices. Data on seroprevalence of common vaccine preventable infections in HIV-infected individuals is lacking. We carried out a retrospective cohort study to investigate serological immunity and factors associated with immunity to hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and varicalla virus (VZV) in a cohort of HIV-infected individuals attending a large ambulatory HIV specialist centre in Ireland. Basic demographic data including risk of acquisition of HIV and region of origin was recorded. Between-group prevalence was compared using the Chi2 test and Wilkoxin signed rank test. Univariate variables with p<0.2 were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. Of 1287 HIV-infected individuals included in this study (median [SD] age 39 [10] years, 68% male, 46% Irish), 75% were hepatitis A IgG positive, 94% were VZV IgG positive, 3% were HBV surface antigen (sAg) positive while 29% were HBV core antibody (cAb) positive. This study identifies a significant proportion of HIV infected who were susceptible to common vaccine preventable infections. These results highlight the importance of proactive screening and immunization of HIV-infected individuals to ensure optimal protect ionagainst vaccine preventable diseases in this at risk patient group."
15942,0.01,2.0000,"Our goal was to determine the prevalence of, and risk factors associated with, syphilis in HIV-infected patients who attend an AIDS outpatient clinic in Vitoria, Brazil. We conducted a cross-sectional study-including interviews for demographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics-and blood collection (venipuncture and fingerstick) for VDRL and treponemal tests (rapid test) in a total of 438 patients. The mean age was 43.0 years (SD = 11), and mean years of school was 8.1 (SD = 4.2). The prevalence of syphilis was 5.3 % (95 % CI 3.3-7.3). The treponemal test was positive in 18.9 % of participants. In multivariate analysis, prevalent syphilis infection was independently associated with male gender (AOR 4.6, 95 % CI 1.1-20.0), a history of male-male sex (AOR 1.8, 95 % CI 1.6-4.1), current use of antiretroviral therapy (AOR 5.5, 95 % CI 1.7-16.7), and history of treated syphilis infection (AOR 5.5, 95 % CI 2.0-15.8). Syphilis prevalence was high in patients living with HIV/AIDS who attend an AIDS clinic; therefore, routine sexually transmitted infections counseling and screening should be included in their care.

13486,0.01,2.0000,"Despite a recent reduction in the number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections attributed to injecting drug use in the United States, 9% of new U.S. HIV infections in 2009 occurred among injecting drug users (IDUs). To monitor HIV-associated behaviors and HIV prevalence among IDUs, CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System (NHBS) conducts interviews and HIV testing in selected metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). This report summarizes data from 10,073 IDUs interviewed and tested in 20 MSAs in 2009. Of IDUs tested, 9% had a positive HIV test result, and 45% of those testing positive were unaware of their infection. Among the 9,565 IDUs with HIV negative or unknown HIV status before the survey, 69% reported having unprotected vaginal sex, 34% reported sharing syringes, and 23% reported having unprotected heterosexual anal sex during the 12 previous months. Although these risk behavior prevalences appear to warrant increased access to HIV testing and prevention services, for the previous 12-month period, only 49% of the IDUs at risk for acquiring HIV infection reported having been tested for HIV, and 19% reported participating in a behavioral intervention. Increased HIV prevention and testing efforts are needed to further reduce HIV infections among IDUs."
6855,0.01,2.0000,"Viral hepatitis constitutes a major health issue, with high prevalence among injecting drug users (IDUs). The present study assessed the prevalence and risk determinants for hepatitis B, C and D viruses (HBV, HCV and HDV) infections among 102 IDUs from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Serological markers and HCV-RNA were detected by enzyme immunoassay and nested PCR, respectively. HCV genotyping was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP). HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HBs were found in 7.8, 55.8 and 24. 7% of IDUs, respectively. In the final logistic regression, HBV infection was independently associated with male homosexual intercourse within the last 5 years (odds ratio (OR) 3.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-8.8). No subject presented anti-delta (anti-HD). Anti-HCV was detected in 69.6% of subjects, and was found to be independently associated with needle sharing in the last 6 months (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.3-9.2) and with longer duration of iv drug use (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.1-8.7). These data demonstrate that this population is at high risk for both HBV and HCV infection. Among IDUs from Rio de Janeiro, unprotected sexual intercourse seems to be more closely associated with HBV infection, whereas HCV is positively correlated with high risk injecting behavior. Comprehensive public health interventions targeting this population and their sexual partners must be encouraged."
14171,0.01,2.0000,"In the last 25 years, HIV-1, the retrovirus responsible for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), has gone from being an ""inherently untreatable"" infectious agent to one eminently susceptible to a range of approved therapies. During a five-year period, starting in the mid-1980s, my group at the National Cancer Institute played a role in the discovery and development of the first generation of antiretroviral agents, starting in 1985 with Retrovir (zidovudine, AZT) in a collaboration with scientists at the Burroughs-Wellcome Company (now GlaxoSmithKline). We focused on AZT and related congeners in the dideoxynucleoside family of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), taking them from the laboratory to the clinic in response to the pandemic of AIDS, then a terrifying and lethal disease. These drugs proved, above all else, that HIV-1 infection is treatable, and such proof provided momentum for new therapies from many sources, directed at a range of viral targets, at a pace that has rarely if ever been matched in modern drug development. Antiretroviral therapy has brought about a substantial decrease in the death rate due to HIV-1 infection, changing it from a rapidly lethal disease into a chronic manageable condition, compatible with very long survival. This has special implications within the classic boundaries of public health around the world, but at the same time in certain regions may also affect a cycle of economic and civil instability in which HIV-1/AIDS is both cause and consequence. Many challenges remain, including (1) the life-long duration of therapy; (2) the ultimate role of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP); (3) the cardiometabolic side-effects or other toxicities of long-term therapy; (4) the emergence of drug-resistance and viral genetic diversity (non-B subtypes); (5) the specter of new cross-species transmissions from established retroviral reservoirs in apes and Old World monkeys; and (6) the continued pace of new HIV-1 infections in many parts of the world. All of these factors make refining current therapies and developing new therapeutic paradigms essential priorities, topics covered in articles within this special issue of Antiviral Research. Fortunately, there are exciting new insights into the biology of HIV-1, its interaction with cellular resistance factors, and novel points of attack for future therapies. Moreover, it is a short journey from basic research to public health benefit around the world. The current science will lead to new therapeutic strategies with far-reaching implications in the HIV-1/AIDS pandemic. This article forms part of a special issue of Antiviral Research marking the 25th anniversary of antiretroviral drug discovery and development, Vol. 85, issue 1, 2010."
9530,0.01,2.0000,Fatigue is a common symptom of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and a frequent side-effect of peginterferon/ribavirin (PR) therapy for HCV. This study evaluated the impact of adding the oral HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor simeprevir to PR on patient-reported fatigue and health status among patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection enrolled in the Phase IIb PILLAR and ASPIRE trials [NCT00882908; NCT00980330].
4453,0.01,2.0000,"Approximately one-third of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are concomitantly infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). As a result, liver disease remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in HIV patients. Prior to 2011, treatments of HCV lacked efficacy in clinical trials in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Fortunately, several direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have now entered clinical practice and others have reached advanced stages of clinical development. These therapies offer significant benefits such as improved rates of sustained virologic response (SVR), shortened durations of treatment, and compatibility with HIV antiretroviral therapies. Treatments such as sofosbuvir (SOF) have received approval for HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Moreover, interferon-free options exist for HIV/HCV co-infected patients who may be ineligible or intolerant of interferon. Despite these improvements, physicians must be aware of the differences between these DAAs, the patient characteristics that play a role on the effectiveness of these medications, and the drug-drug interactions these DAAs may have with existing HIV antiretroviral therapies. The aim of this review is to discuss the prevalence and incidence of HIV/HCV co-infection, critical factors related to patient evaluation, current treatment options, and new developments in the management of HIV/HCV co-infected patients.

3121,0.01,2.0000,"A case of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) developed cryptococcosis which was successfully treated with amphotericin B (AMPH) and fluconazole (FLCZ) is reported. A 52-year-old man was admitted because of pyrexia and oral candidiasis. He had a history of multiple sexual exposures to persons at risk for AIDS in Thailand. On admission, serologic tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 were positive on both EIA and Western blot analysis for anti-HIV-1 antibody. Furthermore, test for cryptococcal antigen and fungal cultures from blood and cerebrospinal fluid revealed that he was suffering from cryptococcemia and cryptococcal meningitis. In spite of identification of Cryptococcus neoformans in his blood and cerebrospinal fluid, the finding of cerebrospinal fluid had a minimal inflammatory response with mild elevation of protein. He was initially treated with intravenous AMPH, 10 to 30 mg a day, for 7 weeks, and then was given oral FLCZ, 400 mg a day, for the suppressive therapy. His fever subsided three weeks after the start of AMPH therapy. He was eventually discharged 9 weeks after the start of therapy without any symptoms, and continued to receive oral FLCZ as an out-patient. Thus, attention should be paid to diagnosis and treatment for cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients."
15415,0.01,2.0000,"Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head is an emerging complication in HIV infected patients. It has been suggested that the increased incidence of AVN in this population may be caused by an increased prevalence of predisposing factors for osteonecrosis, including protease inhibitors, hyperlipidemia, corticosteroid use, alcohol and intravenous drug abuse. The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors for avascular necrosis developing in the femoral head of HIV infected individuals. This study consisted of meta-analysis of the secondary data extracted from current literature. The selected articles allowed two study groups to be drawn up for comparison. Group 1 comprised 324 individuals infected by the HIV virus, who did not present femoral head AVN. Group 2 comprised 32 HIV positive patients, who presented femoral head AVN. The parameters used for analysis were as follows: age, gender, sexual preference, use of intravenous drugs, time of diagnosis, CD4+ cell count, use of antiretroviral agents and duration, serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides. The present study found a statistically significant association between hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, sexual preference and intravenous drug abuse. The authors concluded that femoral head osteonecrosis is associated with hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia) and intravenous drug abuse. This study supports the hypothesis that protease inhibitors play a role in the development of osteonecrosis through a tendency to cause hyperlipidemia."

1130,0.01,2.0000,"Psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and depression have long been associated with risk behaviors for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). The US prison population is reported to have elevated rates of HIV, hepatitis and most psychiatric disorders. This study examined the association of six major psychiatric disorders with HIV mono-infection, HIV/HCV co-infection and HIV/HBV co-infection in one of the nation's largest prison populations. The study population consisted of 370,511 Texas Department of Criminal Justice inmates who were incarcerated for any duration between January 1, 2003 and July 1, 2006. Information on medical conditions and sociodemographic factors was obtained from an institution-wide electronic medical information system. Offenders diagnosed with HIV mono-infection, HIV/HCV, HIV/HBV and all HIV combined exhibited elevated rates of major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, non-schizophrenic psychotic disorder and any psychiatric disorder. In comparison to offenders with HIV mono-infection, those with HIV/HCV co-infection had an elevated prevalence of any psychiatric disorder. This cross-sectional study's finding of positive associations between psychiatric disease and both HIV infection and hepatitis co-infection among Texas prison inmates holds both clinical and public health relevance. It will be important for future investigations to examine the extent to which psychiatric disorders serve as a barrier to medical care, communication with clinicians and adherence to prescribed medical regimens among both HIV-mono-infected and HIV/hepatitis-co-infected inmates."
6186,0.01,2.0000,"More than a million people in the United States are now infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and by 1991, the United States will record 270,000 cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). At present, there is no way to estimate the number of AIDS patients who will be living in 1991. Intestinal diseases exert considerable morbidity and mortality on AIDS patients and persons with AIDS-related complex. The elevated frequency of certain intestinal infectious diseases in homosexual male AIDS patients has been attributed to sexual practices, but food seems a probable vector for some proportion of the infections in all AIDS-affected groups. Intestinal infectious diseases and resulting systemic infections can be life-threatening to AIDS patients. The infections may serve as cofactors that hasten HIV disease progression to AIDS, but absolute proof of this hypothesis is lacking. The longer the HIV-infected person maintains good general health and avoids potentially lethal infectious diseases, the better are the chances that effective treatments will be developed and made available. Foodborne diseases are generally avoidable, and increased education of AIDS patients and their physicians as to their nature is the key to their prevention."
6815,0.01,2.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has been associated with lipodystrophy, insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. We investigated the effects of rosiglitazone or metformin on fasting and postprandial inflammatory and antioxidant variables in HIV-infected males with lipodystrophy. Thirty-one patients were randomly assigned to receive either rosiglitazone (4 mg twice daily) or metformin (1 g twice daily) for 26 weeks. At baseline and after treatment, standardized 10-h oral fat loading tests were performed. Before treatment, inflammatory variables remained unchanged but there was a postprandial decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and paraoxonase (PON1) activity. Rosiglitazone and metformin reduced homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA) similarly (-34% and -37%, respectively, P<0.05 for each). Both treatments increased fasting and postprandial PON1 activity and decreased postprandial monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) concentrations. However, plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration did not change throughout the study. To decrease insulin resistance results in a higher anti-oxidant and consequent lower pro-inflammatory action of HDL. This may confer protection against accelerated atherosclerosis in these patients."
8390,0.01,2.0000,"Latinos are more likely to delay HIV testing, present to care with an AIDS defining illness, and die within one year of learning their HIV-positive status than non-Latino blacks and whites. For this paper, we explore the role of partner-relationship characteristics and health behaviors, in predicting HIV testing among Latina adult women who engaged in risky sexual behaviors (i.e., unprotected vaginal and/or anal sex). Data from a convenience sample of 168 Latina adult women who engaged in risky sexual behavior in the year prior to assessment were analyzed for this paper. Rates and predictors of HIV testing among this sample were assessed after a five-year follow-up. Descriptive and analytical estimates include incidence rates and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) from multilevel models. At five-year follow-up, 63.7% (n = 107) women reported having been tested for HIV, of whom 12.2% (n = 13) were women who never tested before. Main reasons for not having been tested at follow-up included: low risk perception (62.1%) and trusting their partner(s)/being in a monogamous relationship/knowing their partner's HIV status (17.2%). Predictors of HIV testing included: age (AOR: 0.96; 95% CI = 0.92-0.99), provider endorsement of HIV testing (AOR: 4.59; 95% CI = 1.77-11.95), poor quality of their romantic relationships (AOR: 1.12; 95% CI = 1.03-1.26), and knowing the HIV sero-status of sexual partner (AOR: 3.61; 95% CI = 1.46-8.95). This study characterizes a group of Latina women at high risk for HIV infection and their HIV testing behaviors. Our findings underscore the need of increasing access to quality health-care services and HIV behavioral interventions, and to strengthen the adherence to HIV/sexually transmitted disease testing recommendations and guidelines among local health-care providers serving the Latino community in South Florida."
8929,0.01,2.0000,"An investigation was conducted involving 255 renal transplant recipients in the state of Goiás, Central Brazil, to determine the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV), its risk factors, the genotypes involved, and the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) present in the patients. All serum samples were tested for anti-HCV antibodies and HCV RNA. Forty-one patients were anti-HCV and/or HCV RNA positive, resulting in an overall HCV infection prevalence of 16.1% (95% CI: 11.9-21.3). A multivariate analysis of risk factors showed that a history of blood transfusions without anti-HCV screening, the length of time spent on hemodialysis, and renal transplantation before 1994 are all associated with HCV positivity. In HCV-positive patients, only 12.2% had ALT levels above normal. Twenty-eight samples were genotyped as genotype 1, subtypes 1a (62.5%) and 1b (31.3%), and two samples (6.2%) were genotype 3, subtype 3a. These data show a high prevalence of HCV infection and low ALT levels in the studied population. The risk factor analysis findings emphasize the importance of public health strategies such as anti-HCV screening of candidate blood and organ donors, in addition to the stricter adoption of hemodialysis-specific infection control measures. The present study also demonstrates that HCV genotype 1 (subtype 1a) is predominant in this population."
11933,0.01,2.0000,"HIV infection treatment strategies have historically defined effectiveness through measuring patient plasma HIV RNA. While combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) can reduce plasma viral load (pVL) to undetectable levels, the degree that HIV is eliminated from other anatomical sites remains unclear. We investigated the HIV DNA levels in 229 varied autopsy tissues from 20 HIV-positive (HIV(+)) cART-treated study participants with low or undetectable plasma VL and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VL prior to death who were enrolled in the National Neurological AIDS Bank (NNAB) longitudinal study and autopsy cohort. Extensive medical histories were obtained for each participant. Autopsy specimens, including at least six brain and nonbrain tissues per participant, were reviewed by study pathologists. HIV DNA, measured in tissues by quantitative and droplet digital PCR, was identified in 48/87 brain tissues and 82/142 nonbrain tissues at levels >200 HIV copies/million cell equivalents. No participant was found to be completely free of tissue HIV. Parallel sequencing studies from some tissues recovered intact HIV DNA and RNA. Abnormal histological findings were identified in all participants, especially in brain, spleen, lung, lymph node, liver, aorta, and kidney. All brain tissues demonstrated some degree of pathology. Ninety-five percent of participants had some degree of atherosclerosis, and 75% of participants died with cancer. This study assists in characterizing the anatomical locations of HIV, in particular, macrophage-rich tissues, such as the central nervous system (CNS) and testis. Additional studies are needed to determine if the HIV recovered from tissues promotes the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, cancer, and atherosclerosis."
11642,0.01,2.0000,"The presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in case of negative HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) in serum is known as ""occult hepatitis B"". There are many reports indicating that occult HBV infections are more frequently encountered in case of hepatocellular carcinoma, hemodialysis practice and co-infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of HBV-DNA in HBsAg negative hemodialysis. patients and subjects who had never experienced hemodialysis. A total of 226 HBsAg negative sera were included to the study, of which 153 were from hemodialysis patients (97 male, 56 female; mean age: 41.3 +/- 5.8 years), and 73 were from non-hemodialyzed individuals (46 male, 27 female; mean age: 36.5 +/- 6.9 years) who had serological evidence of previous HBV and HCV infections. Of these 73 subjects, 41 were anti-HCV positive, 22 were ""anti-HBc IgG positive alone"", seven were anti-HBc IgG and anti-HBs positive, and three were anti-HBc IgG and anti-HBe positive, while 40 of 153 (26.1%) hemodialysis patients were anti-HCV positive. HBV and HCV markers were detected by commercial enzyme immunoassays (bioMerieux, France and Murex, UK, respectively), and HBV-DNA testing was performed by a commercial real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR; 5700 and 7700 Sequence Detection System, Applied Biosystems, UK) assay. Nineteen (12.4%) of HBsAg-negative hemodialysis patients and five (6.8%) of the non-hemodialyzed subjects were found positive for HBV-DNA (viral loads were > or =10(4) copies/ml, and 10(3)-10(4) copies/ml, repectively). The rates of occult HBV infection in the anti-HCV positive hemodialysis patients and anti-HCV positive non-hemodialyzed subjects were detected as 27.5% (11/40) and 2.4% (1/41), respectively. These rates in the other groups were found as follows; 7.1% (8/113) in the anti-HCV negative hemodialysis patients, 9.1% (2/22) in the ""anti-HBc positive alone"" subjects, and 20% (2/10) in the subjects positive for anti-HBc+anti-HBs or anti-HBe. The results of this study indicated that the prevalence of HBV viremia (12.4%) in hemodialysis patients being more prominent in those of anti-HCV positive patients (27.5%) should not be overlooked. In conclusion, the hemodialysis patients should be screened by sensitive PCR-based methods for occult HBV infections, even if they were negative for HBsAg, in order to prevent or at least to decrease the transmission risk of HBV infection which is still an important health problem in dialysis units."
2628,0.01,2.0000,"Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) represent an extrahepatic hepatitis C virus (HCV) reservoir, the significance of which is unclear due to limited studies and varying test methodologies. In this study, a commercial viral load assay for measuring cell-associated PBMC HCV RNA was evaluated. HCV RNA was extracted from PBMCs, sorted CD14+, and CD19+ cells and corresponding plasma samples using the Abbott m2000 and Real-Time HCV assay. Test performance and influence of HIV seropositivity on plasma and PBMC HCV RNA were studied. Among 51 patients, 67 and 62 unique patient samples had detectable plasma and PBMC HCV viral load, respectively. The median PBMC viral load was 535 IU/1 M cells (range 29-5,190). CD19+ cells had significantly higher viral load than CD14+ cells (median log(10) HCV viral load 2.63 vs. 1.50 IU/ml; P< 0.001). Stability of PBMC viral load over time was demonstrated in untreated patients; all patients with an undetectable plasma HCV viral load after HCV treatment also demonstrated undetectable PBMC viral load. Repeated testing in nine samples yielded consistent PBMC viral load, differing by only 1.3-fold (range 1.0-1.7-fold). Among samples with detectable plasma HCV RNA, the correlation between PBMC and plasma viral load was moderate (r = 0.66) and was greater among HCV mono-infected compared to HIV/HCV co-infected subjects (r = 0.80 vs. 0.52). Measurement of cell-associated PBMC HCV RNA using a commercial assay demonstrated promising test characteristics. Differences in PBMC HCV viral load based on HIV-coinfection status and the significance of greater copy number in B-cells requires further study."
7897,0.01,2.0000,"Nearly three-quarters of human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis C virus (HIV-HCV) coinfected patients in France currently need to be cured of their chronic HCV infection. The increase in sustained virological response rates obtained with the recently available HCV protease inhibitors in treatment-naïve genotype-1 patients has generated considerable hope in these co-infected patients. However, several particularities (such as a higher baseline HCV load, more advanced liver fibrosis, frequent co-morbidities, and the risk of toxicity and drug-drug interactions) have not allowed the direct extrapolation of the results observed in HCV-monoinfected patients to patients with HIV-HCV co-infection. Yet, despite these uncertainties and the little available data from ongoing trials, several proposals can be made not only because the patients and drugs are ready and waiting, but also because the clock is ticking. In general, it can be advocated that HCV triple therapy should be offered to most HIV-infected patients with advanced liver fibrosis, but should be deferred or discussed on a case-by-case basis in those with mild-to-moderate fibrosis. However, such proposals rely on a relatively small amount of evidence and many questions are still pending, as studies in HIV-HCV co-infected patients have been late in coming and are several years behind those in HCV-monoinfected patients. Thus, this situation, in the context of more rapid and more severe infection, and lower response rates with standard care (pegylated interferon and ribavirin), along with the many potential drug-drug interactions (particularly with antiretroviral therapy), underscores the need for earlier evaluation of new strategies, schedules and new direct-acting antivirals in HIV-infected patients."
5058,0.01,2.0000,"Even though new drugs have been approved for treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the risk of drug-drug interactions and concern about overlapping toxicities has hindered the development of studies in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals. Traditional treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (peg-IFN + RBV) is very expensive and has a low rate of sustained virological response in coinfected patients, especially if they are infected with HCV genotype 1. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is a drug that is being evaluated for the treatment of chronic HCV infection, both in HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Understanding the NTZ resistance mechanism could allow the development of resistance to be minimized and would expand the treatment options, mainly in special populations such as HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Similarly to IFN, NTZ increases the activity of the cellular protein kinase activated by double-stranded RNA (PKR), a key kinase in the innate antiviral response. In order to elucidate whether sequence heterogeneity in the PKR-binding domain of HCV NS5A genotype 1 could influence the antiviral activity of either NTZ monotherapy or peg-IFN + RBV, baseline and end-of-therapy plasma samples from two groups of eleven non-responder HIV/HCV-coinfected patients that had received NTZ or peg-IFN + RBV were studied. Most of the HCV NS5A sequences examined at the end of therapy did not change from the baseline, even after 30 days course of antiviral therapy. An extensive comparison of HCV NS5A genotype 1 and 4 sequences from the database with reported IFN therapy outcome was performed in order to infer their phylogenetic relationships. The HCV genotype 1 NS5A nucleotide sequences from therapy-non-responder patients were intermingled amongst those from the database, irrespective of their IFN-therapy outcome. When comparing NS5A-PKRBD amino acid sequences, significant differences were observed in genotype 4, but not in genotype 1 (p < 0.0001 and p > 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, despite IFN and NTZ sharing the protein kinase activated by double-stranded RNA as their cellular target, the HCV genotype 1 strategy to counteract the IFN action mediated by NS5A ISDR/PKRBD does not explain drug resistance in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Other viral factors that are possibly involved are discussed as well. "
10896,0.01,2.0000,"To determine the frequency and risk factors for female to male sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a prospective study was carried out in 422 men who had acquired a sexually transmitted disease (STD) from a group of prostitutes with a prevalence of HIV-1 infection of 85%. The initial seroprevalence of HIV among the men was 12%. 24 of 293 (8.2%) initially seronegative men seroconverted to HIV-1. Newly acquired infection was independently associated with frequent prostitute contact (risk ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2-8.1), with the acquisition of genital ulcer disease (risk ratio 4.7, 95% confidence interval 1.3-17.0), and with being uncircumcised (risk ratio 8.2, 95% confidence interval 3.0-23.0). 96% of documented seroconversions occurred in men with one or both of the latter two risk factors. In a subgroup of 73 seronegative men who reported a single prostitute sexual contact, the frequency of HIV-1 infection was 8.2% during 12 weeks of observation. No man without a genital ulcer seroconverted. A cumulative 43% of uncircumcised men who acquired an ulcer seroconverted to HIV-1 after a single sexual exposure. These data indicate an extremely high rate of female to male transmission of HIV-1 in the presence of STD and confirm a causal relation between lack of male circumcision, genital ulcer disease, and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection."
672,0.01,2.0000,"In 29 antiretroviral-naive HIV-2-infected patients starting lopinavir/ritonavir-containing regimen, the median CD4 cell count change from baseline (142 cells/microl) was +71 cells/microl at week 24 and +132 cells/microl at week 96. Seventeen (59%) patients had a CD4 cell count increase of at least 50 cells/microl and undetectable HIV-2 RNA at week 24 and were considered as responders to treatment. This sustained elevation of CD4 cell count in the first 2 years of combination antiretroviral therapy shows the potential for lopinavir/ritonavir regimens as first-line therapy in HIV-2 infection."
12766,0.01,2.0000,"We investigated depression in relationship to sexual risk behaviour with primary partners among HIV-positive clients in Uganda. Baseline data were analyzed from a cohort of clients starting antiretroviral therapy. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to classify depressive severity (none, minor and major depression) and symptom type (cognitive and somatic). Condom use was assessed over the past six months and during the last episode of sexual intercourse. A total of 386 participants had a primary sex partner, with whom 41.6% always used condoms during sex over the past six months, and 62.4% during last sex. Use of a condom during last sex was associated with having no depression and lower PHQ-9 total and cognitive and somatic subscale scores in bivariate analyses; most of these relationships were marginally significant for intercourse over the past six months. Controlling for demographics, HIV disclosure and partner HIV status, only minor depression was associated with unprotected sex. Depressive symptoms, even if not a clinical disorder, warrant early detection and treatment for promoting HIV prevention among HIV-affected couples. "
8395,0.01,2.0000,"Poor adherence to antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients increases the risk of incomplete viral suppression, development of viral resistance, progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome and death. This study assesses the impact of specific treatment-related adverse events (AEs) on adherence to ART in the adult HIV patient population. A systematic review of studies involving adult HIV-infected patients aged ≥ 16 years that reported an odds ratio (OR) for factors affecting adherence to ART was conducted through a search of the EMBASE(®) and Medline(®) databases. Database searches were complemented with a search of titles in the bibliographies of review papers. Studies conducted in populations limited to a particular demographic characteristic or behavioural risk were excluded. To qualify for inclusion into a meta-analysis, treatment-related AEs had to be defined similarly across studies. Also, multiple ORs from the same study were included where study sub-groups were distinct. Random effects models were used to pool ORs. In total, 19 studies and 18 ART-related AEs were included in meta-analyses. Adherence to ART was significantly lower in patients with non-specific AEs than in patients who did not experience AEs [OR = 0.623; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.465-0.834]. Patients with specific AEs such as fatigue (OR = 0.631; 95% CI: 0.433-0.918), confusion (OR = 0.349; 95% CI: 0.184-0.661), taste disturbances (OR = 0.485; 95% CI: 0.303-0.775) and nausea (OR = 0.574; 95% CI: 0.427-0.772) were significantly less likely to adhere to ART compared to patients without these AEs. Knowledge of specific treatment-related AEs may allow for targeted management of these events and a careful consideration of well-tolerated treatment regimens to improve ART adherence and clinical outcomes."
17120,0.01,2.0000,"Integrated models of HIV/AIDS service delivery are believed to have advantages over stand-alone models of care from health planners' and providers' perspectives. Integration models differ, yet there is little information about the influence of differing models on workers' beliefs about models' efficacy. Here, we examine the effect of integration of HIV care into the general health system in India. In 2014, India replaced its stand-alone model of HIV service delivery-Community Care Centers (CCCs)-with a purported integrated model that delivers HIV medical services at general hospitals and HIV psychosocial services at nearby Care and Support Centers (CSCs). We examine 15 health workers' perceptions of how change from the earlier stand-alone model to the current model impacted women's care in a district in Uttar Pradesh, India. Results indicate that (1) Women's antiretroviral (ART) adherence and utilization of psychosocial support service for HIV/AIDS suffered when services were not provided at one site; (2) Provision of inpatient care in the CCC model offered women living in poverty personal safety in accessing HIV health services and promoted chances of competent ART usage and repeat service utilization; and (3) Although integration of HIV services with the general health system was perceived to improve patient anonymity and decrease chances of HIV-related stigma and discrimination, resource shortages continued to plague the integrated system while shifting costs of time and money to the patients. Findings suggest that integration efforts need to consider the context of service provision and the gendered nature of access to HIV care."
15050,0.01,2.0000,"To examine the influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on complications in dialysis access surgery, a review was performed on patients undergoing hemodialysis at two major metropolitan medical centers over a 30-month period. One hundred eight patients underwent a total of 169 graft procedures; mean follow-up was 14 1/2 months. There were 18 (17%) patients who were HIV-positive who had no symptoms, 11 (10%) patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and 79 (73%) patients who were HIV-negative. Twenty-three percent (25/108) of patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA), most of whom also had either AIDS or asymptomatic HIV infection. Dialysis procedures included 44 autogenous reconstructions (26%), 117 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts (69%), and 8 (5%) procedures of unknown type. Arteriovenous fistula or graft thrombosis was a frequent complication. The overall 12-month graft patency rate was 41%, and patients with HIV infection or a history of IVDA did not have a significantly increased risk of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that the use of PTFE as opposed to autogenous reconstruction was the only significant risk factor found for occlusion within the first 12 months after operation (p < 0.01). Twenty-five graft infections occurred, all in PTFE grafts. The PTFE graft infection rate was 43% in patients with AIDS, 36% in patients who were HIV-positive and who had no symptoms, and 15% in patients who were HIV-negative (p < 0.05). Patients with a history of IVDA had a 41% PTFE graft infection rate versus a 13% infection rate in patients who did not have a history of IVDA (p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
17026,0.01,2.0000,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the frequency and determinants of rectal bleeding and the association between rectal bleeding and risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among homosexual/ bisexual men in Mexico City. Men who requested anonymous HIV testing at a public clinic in Mexico City and who reported engaging in any homosexual behavior were eligible to participate in this study. Trained staff collected information on demographic factors, sexual behavior, psychological states, and HIV serostatus from all consenting, eligible clients. Logistic regression modeling was used to investigate the independent effect of risk factors among 2,758 men who were tested between June 1991 and December 1992. Bleeding during anal intercourse was a common occurrence: More than one third of the men in the study reported some bleeding, and 8% reported bleeding in half or more of their intercourse episodes. The prevalence of HIV infection among bleeders was 42% as compared with 28% in nonbleeders (p < 0.0001), and the adjusted odds ratio was 1.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.8) for men who bled in more than half of their anal intercourse episodes relative to nonbleeders. There was a trend of increasing HIV seroprevalence with increasing frequency of rectal bleeding (p = 0.001). Nine percent of all HIV infections and 42% of infections among frequent bleeders were attributable to rectal bleeding. Men who reported both rectal bleeding and anal warts were 3.5 (95% CI 2.1-5.8) times more likely to be HIV-infected in multivariate analysis than men reporting neither rectal bleeding nor anal warts. Determinants of rectal bleeding included older age, more education, more receptive anal intercourse than insertive intercourse, receptive digital-anal contact, anal warts, and genital ulcers. Among men reporting sex with men in Mexico City, rectal bleeding is common. It is an independent risk factor for HIV infection, and warrants attention in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome prevention efforts. Rectal bleeding that results from rupture of anal warts may be an especially effective portal of HIV transmission."
18136,0.01,2.0000,"Ill-health contributes to impoverishment, a process brought into sharper focus by the impact of the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic. This paper reviews studies that have measured the economic costs and consequences of illness for households, focusing on malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and HIV/AIDS. It finds that in resource-poor settings illness imposed high and regressive cost burdens on patients and their families. Direct and indirect costs of illness for malaria were less than 10% of the household income, but still significant when combined with the costs of other illnesses. The costs of TB and HIV/AIDS were catastrophic for households (more than 10% of the income). Health service weaknesses in many countries, including low coverage, user charges, and poor quality of care, contributed to high costs. Poor households in developing countries with a member with TB or HIV/AIDS struggled to cope, highlighting the urgent need for a substantial increase in health sector investment to expand access to preventive and curative health services. Government and non-governmental interventions should also be broadened to encompass measures that reduce the substantial indirect costs associated with diseases such as malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS."
15926,0.01,2.0000,"Medication adherence is linked to health outcomes among adults with HIV infection. Transgender women living with HIV (TWLWH) in the US report suboptimal adherence to medications and are found to have difficulty integrating HIV medication into their daily routine, but few studies explore the factors associated with medication adherence among transgender women. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine demographic and clinical factors related to self-reported medication adherence among transgender women. This secondary analysis is based on data collected from the Symptom and Genetic Study that included a convenience sample of 22 self-identified transgender women, 201 non-transgender men, and 72 non-transgender women recruited in northern California. Self-reported medication adherence was assessed using the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Adherence Questionnaire. Gender differences in demographic and clinical variables were assessed, as were differences between transgender women reporting high and low adherence. Transgender women had lower adherence to medications compared to non-transgender males and non-transgender females (p = .028) and were less likely to achieve viral suppression (p = .039). Within the transgender group, Black/African-Americans reported better adherence than participants who were Whites/Caucasian or other races (p = .009). Adherence among transgender women was unrelated to medication count and estrogen therapy, but consistent with other reports on the HIV population as a whole; transgender women with high adherence were more likely to achieve viral suppression compared to the transgender women with low adherence. Despite the high incidence of HIV infection in the transgender population, few studies focus on TWLWH, either in regard to their adherence to antiretroviral therapies or to their healthcare in general. To address ongoing health disparities, more studies are needed focusing on the transgender population's continuum of care in HIV therapies."

Three patients presented with confusion, two with fever and headache, two with anxiety and depression, one with slow mentation and memory loss and one with expressive dysphasia. Five patients had previous AIDS-defining diagnoses: four of these five patients had previous cutaneous HSV infection. HSV DNA was detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in seven patients. HSV infection was diagnosed by brain biopsy (after negative PCR on CSF) in one patient and at autopsy in one patient (after negative CSF PCR and brain biopsy). Seven patients received specific anti-viral therapy; two died of unrelated causes and the other five recovered. Two patients were not treated, in one the diagnosis was made at autopsy and the other recovered spontaneously. HIV-infected patients with CNS HSV infection have a varied presentation. Diagnosis by PCR on CSF identified the majority of cases. With specific treatment the outcome was good."
1861,0.01,2.0000,"The impacts of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on quality of life, mental health, labor productivity, and economic wellbeing for people living with HIV/AIDS in developing countries are only beginning to be measured. We conducted a systematic literature review to analyze the effect of ART on these economic and quality of life indicators in developing countries and assess the state of research on these topics. We searched Ovid/Medline, PubMed, Psych Info, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the abstract database of the International AIDS Society Conference and the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. Both qualitative and quantitative studies were included, as were peer-reviewed articles, gray literature, and conference abstracts and presentations. Findings are reported from 21 publications, including 14 full-length articles, six abstracts, and one presentation (representing 16 studies). Compared to HIV-positive patients not yet on treatment, patients on ART reported significant improvements in physical, emotional and mental health, and daily function. Work performance improved and absenteeism decreased, with the most dramatic changes occurring in the first three months of treatment and then leveling off. Little research has been done on the impact of ART on household wellbeing, with modest changes in child and family wellbeing within households where adults are receiving ART reportrd so far. Most studies from developing countries have not yet assessed economic and quality of life outcomes of therapy beyond the first year; therefore, longitudinal outcomes are still unknown. Findings were limited geographically, with an emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa and adult treatment. As ART roll out extends throughout high HIV prevalence, low-resource countries and is sustained over years and decades, research on pediatric and differential gender economic and quality of life outcomes will become increasingly urgent, as will systematic evaluation of ART programs."
410,0.01,2.0000,"During 1985 and 1986, the Centers for Disease Control conducted eight surveys to evaluate laboratory performance in testing for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). (Other names for this virus include ""human T-lymphotropic virus type III"" and ""lymphadenopathy associated virus."") The first survey was conducted with ten samples and 50 laboratories; the remaining surveys used six samples, but enrollment increased to as many as 475 laboratories. The purpose of these surveys was to measure test performance by the laboratories under the actual conditions of use. The surveys contained duplicate samples to permit measurement of within- and between-survey reproducibility. One survey included positive and negative reference materials as evaluation samples. Results of the Western blot (WB) test were not always positive on samples that were positive by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and sometimes they were positive on samples that had negative results by EIA. The percentage of positive results reported by laboratories using Electronucleonics tests was lower than that reported by users of Abbott and of Litton tests. positive results on the negative reference material were reported by 13.7% of the Abbott EIA test users. The tests do not seem to be calibrated against an equivalent standard. Within-survey reproducibility was usually above 95% for EIA and WB methods and for the major manufacturers of EIA tests. Between-survey reproducibility was usually above 90%. Reproducibility was below 75% for some combinations of samples, method, and manufacturer. The test performance observed in these surveys may be lower than is actually achieved on patient samples because the samples were selected to measure technical competence and contain a higher frequency of samples with low reactivity than would be encountered with clinical samples. Stratification and weighting of the results in these surveys to estimate performance parameters for a blood bank population indicate that the tests are performing well in this application. If single EIA tests at the performance levels achieved in these surveys were used (no repeat and no confirmation), about 1 sample with positive results in every 50,000 samples tested would be missed and about 2.5% would be false positive results. Because tests are duplicated and confirmed in blood banks, better performance would be expected. Testing for antibody to HIV virus continues to undergo rapid change because of the introduction of new tests, changes in technical aspects of existing tests, and application of testing to changing populations. Such dynamic factors necessitate an ongoing, comprehensive monitoring of test performance."
7871,0.01,2.0000,"We estimated the impact of loss to follow-up (LTFU) on the mortality rate among HIV-1-infected patients in Curaçao. A total of 214 therapy-naive HIV-1-infected patients aged 15 years or older upon entering into HIV care between January 2005 and July 2009 were included. Persons who discontinued follow-up for more than 365 days were defined as LTFU and traced with the aim of registering their vital status. If no personal contact could be made, data were matched with the Curaçao National Death Registry. Mortality rates were estimated before and after starting combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). We used log-rank tests to compare survival rates among patients LTFU and patients who experienced continuous follow-up. Pre-cART mortality in patients LTFU was similar to pre-cART mortality in those with continuous follow-up (p=0.79). All pre-cART deaths occurred within 6 months after entry. Low CD4 cell count was predictive of a shorter time to death after entry. Adjusting for those who were LTFU, the mortality rate after starting cART increased from 4.3 to 5.5 per 100 person years of observation (p=0.06). Mortality after starting cART was highest in the first 2 months after starting cART, especially for those who had late disease stage. Mortality rates were lower in patients with continuous follow-up compared to LTFUs (p<0.001). Mortality rates in HIV-1-infected patients who have started cART in Curaçao are underestimated as a result of inefficient patient administration combined with people starting cART at a very late disease stage. Monitoring HIV treatment could help in reducing the risk of LTFU and may improve the effect of treatment."

The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence and the epidemiological profile of HCV infection among abusers of illegal injected and non-injected drugs in Cuiabá, state of Mato Grosso, Central Brazil. A cross-sectional study including 314 male drug users from eight detoxification centres was performed. Out of 314 subjects studied, 48 (15.2%) were intravenous drug users. Participants were interviewed and had blood samples taken and tested for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies. Positive samples were tested for the presence of HCV RNA. Genotyping was performed on HCV RNA-positive samples. The overall prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies was 6.4% (n = 20). Out of 20 anti-HCV antibody-positive subjects, 16 (80%) were also HCV RNA-positive. Genotype 1 predominated (75%), followed by 3a (25%). Subtype 1a was more common than 1b. HCV infection was more prevalent among intravenous drug users (33%) than non-injecting users (1.5%). Logistic regression analyses showed independent associations between HCV infection and intravenous drug use, imprisonment and increasing age. In the present study, injecting drug use was the factor most strongly associated to HCV infection and inhaling or sniffing did not represent an increased susceptibility to infection."

However, the prevalence of hypogonadism is not known among men with weight loss related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). From 1997 through 1999, we investigated total and free testosterone levels in 90 men who were <90% of ideal body weight or had weight loss of >10% from preillness weight; 71% of these subjects were receiving HAART. Twenty-one percent of the subjects receiving HAART had low free testosterone levels. No correlation was seen between weight, CD4 cell count, medication status, and other clinical factors. These data suggest that hypogonadism remains relatively common in men with AIDS wasting, despite treatment with HAART. HIV-infected men with wasting syndrome should be screened for hypogonadism and receive physiological androgen replacement therapy if they are hypogonadal."
17510,0.01,2.0000,"Previous studies have demonstrated that coinfection with HPgV is a protective factor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, leading to slower disease progression, and longer survival after established disease. The present study sought to estimate the prevalence of HPgV infection and associated risk factors in patients harboring C or non-C HIV-1 subtypes followed-up at HU-FURG, southern Brazil. Samples from 347 HIV-1-infected subjects were subjected to plasma RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, HPgV RNA detection, and HIV-1 genotyping. The overall prevalence of HPgV RNA was 34%. Individuals aged 18-30 years had higher chances of infection compared with those 50 years or older (95%CI 1.18-52.36, P = 0.03). The number of sexual partner between one and three was a risk factor for HPgV infection (95%CI 1.54-10.23; P < 0.01), as well as the time since diagnosis of HIV-1 ≥ 11 years (95%CI 1.01-2.89; P = 0.04).

15604,0.01,2.0000,"Liver cirrhosis main related to hepatitis C virus constitutes the main indication of liver transplantation in Europe and the USA, representing as many as 50% of the indications in adults, while cirrhosis associated with hepatitis B virus represents around 10%. The indications for transplantation in patients with infection by both viruses are fulminant hepatitis, decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Both injections may relapse after transplantation. The evolution of the relapse in the graft is variable and can include non-significant alterations of the liver junction tests, chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis. Less frequently, a particularly severe form called ""fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis"" can develop, which rapidly evolve to graft failure. The immunoglobin against the B virus and lamivudine reduce the risk of reinfection. The principal factor associated with reinfection is active viral replication before the transplantation, thus it is considered a contraindication for liver transplantation. INF-alpha has been used in the treatment of hepatitis B virus reinfection with discouraging results. More recently, lamivudine and adefovir have been used. Post-transplantation recurrence of hepatitis C is universal and its evolution towards cirrhosis is more rapid than in immunocompetent patients, with graft dysfunction being the most frequent cause of mortality and of indication for retransplantation. Different factors have been related to the severity of the recurrence including factors related to the donor, the recipient, the virus, immunosuppression and surgery. There are no preventive treatments against recurrence of post-transplantation hepatitis C. In the treatment of the hepatitis C virus recurrence, INF-alpha and rivabirin have been used in single form or in combination with variable results, with the combined therapy being more effective. Recently, encouraging results have been described with the combination of pegylated interferon and rivabirin without a higher incidence of rejection. Finally, the results of retransplantation in patients with recurrent hepatitis B or C have not been encouraging."
10397,0.01,2.0000,"We conducted a case-control study to assess the roles of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha polymorphisms, substance use habits, and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection on the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We enrolled 200 pairs of sex- and age-matched patients with HCC and unrelated healthy controls. TNF-alpha polymorphisms were detected with polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) were detected. We used a structured questionnaire to obtain information about substance use habits.Multivariate analysis indicated that TNF308.2 allele (odds ratio [OR], 3.23; p = 0.011), habitual betel quid chewing (OR, 3.70; p = 0.011), HBsAg (OR, 23.62; p = 0.0001), and anti-HCV (OR, 38.73; p = 0.0001) were independent risk factors for HCC. Having at least 2 substance use habits was associated with risk for HCC. The more substance use habits, the higher the OR for HCC (p(for trend) = 0.0001). There were additive interactions among TNF308.2 allele, substance use habits, and chronic HBV/HCV infection. Multivariate analysis indicated that TNF308.2 allele (p = 0.001), cigarette smoking (p = 0.0001), and alcohol drinking (p = 0.0001) were independent risk factors for habitual betel quid chewing. Moreover, patients harboring the TNF308.2 allele and/or those with habits of substance use had low serum albumin concentration and platelet count (each p = 0.0001). In conclusion, there are independent and additive interactive effects among the TNF308.2 allele, substance use habits, and chronic HBV/HCV infection on the risk for HCC. Substance use habits or carrying the TNF308.2 allele correlates with disease severity and hepatic fibrosis, which may contribute to higher risks for HCC."
7316,0.01,2.0000,"People living with HIV/AIDS in rural and low HIV prevalence areas face a number of challenges including stigma, limited access to specialized medical care, lack of an HIV/AIDS specialist and fear which may interfere with their ability to find and use information to manage their health. With a large number of HIV cases located in non-metropolitan and rural areas in the US, more research is needed to better understand the health seeking behaviors of individuals living in this context. This study examined how 16 individuals living with HIV sought out information to meet their health needs. In qualitative semi-structured interviews, we explored participants' primary sources of information, types of information sought, and barriers to accessing information. The sample was comprised of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who resided in a predominantly rural area with low HIV prevalence. The majority of participants relied on a combination of sources including their HIV/AIDS physician, the Internet, a Ryan-White caseworker and a staff member of a community-based support organization to meet their informational needs. Information sought focused primarily on drug regimens, drug side effects, or drug research. Participants shared barriers to accessing information including stigma, fear, concern about disclosure, and feelings of futility and anger. Findings point to a need to expand health literacy research and interventions to address broader social and structural barriers to health improvement for PLWHA, especially among those living in rural and low HIV prevalence areas."
6000,0.01,2.0000,"Male steady partners of female sex workers (FSW) living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) represent a key population for treatment as prevention and/or pre-exposure prophylaxis interventions. This study uses data collected from male steady partners who were referred by FSW living with HIV participating in a multi-level HIV prevention and care intervention in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. We conducted a socio-behavioral survey and HIV testing with all men (n = 64) and 16 in-depth interviews with a sub-sample to obtain more depth. Thirty-five of the 64 participants were living with HIV; 27 were previously diagnosed and 8 were diagnosed during our study. As a result, 45% of men were members of sero-discordant sexual partnerships. Of men with no previous HIV diagnosis (n = 37), 15 had never been tested for HIV and nine had not been tested in the past two years. Ninety-three percent of men previously diagnosed with HIV reported receiving HIV care in the past 6 months and 78% were taking anti-retrovirals. Low HIV testing was partly due to men not feeling at risk for HIV, despite having an HIV-infected partner. Additionally, a lack of tailored care inhibited engagement in anti-retroviral treatment for those infected. HIV testing was low, highlighting a need for test-and-treat strategies. Men not living with HIV would benefit from regular testing and would be good candidates for pre-exposure prophylaxis. While almost all men who had been diagnosed with HIV were engaged in care and adherent to anti-retroviral therapy, future research should assess whether they are achieving optimal HIV outcomes for their health and prevention of ongoing transmission."
17625,0.01,2.0000,"In Ontario, Canada, the number of heterosexual men living with HIV has increased over time, yet they remain an understudied population. The study objective was to describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of this population, using data from a multisite clinical cohort of patients receiving HIV care. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of men interviewed between 2010 and 2012 were compared according to their self-identified sexual orientation, followed by multivariable linear and logistic regression to assess the association of sexual orientation with CD4 cell count, viral load, hepatitis C co-infection, self-rated health, and mental health concerns after adjustment for covariates. A total of 552 men identified as heterosexual, 2,023 as gay, and 171 as bisexual. Compared to gay and bisexual men, heterosexual men were more likely to have been born outside of Canada (34.8%); more likely to report African, Caribbean, or Black ethnicity (26.4%) or Indigenous ethnicity (13.6%); and more likely to have low socioeconomic status (59.5% earning less than $20,000 per year), and/or a history of injection drug use (31.7%). Relative to gay men, heterosexual men had 5.19 times the odds of co-infection with hepatitis C virus regardless of injection drug use history (95% confidence interval = 3.87-6.96), and 40% lower odds of rating their health as excellent or good (95% confidence interval = 0.50-0.84). HIV-positive heterosexual men in Ontario constituted a socially marginalized group characterized by a high prevalence of injection drug use history and hepatitis C co-infection."
4250,0.01,2.0000,"Low- and intermediate-purity clotting-factor therapies are believed to accelerate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) progression in hemophiliacs through adverse immune effects of the other plasma proteins in the preparations. To investigate this postulate, we evaluated data from six clinical centers that observed persons with congenital factor deficiencies at 6-month intervals. The present analysis is based on HIV-infected subjects who received intermediate purity factor VIII or factor IX concentrates, or cryoprecipitate. For long-term outcome, we classified 374 subjects by the type and amount of treatment during our first year of observation, and determined the subsequent rate of progression to a CD4 count less than 200 cells/microL. A second analysis of this group used a repeated-measures, random-effect model that allowed for individual differences in CD4 decline. Finally, we compared short-term rates of change in CD4 count in each treatment interval of 525 subjects with the type and amount of factor therapy received in the same interval. There was no overall or dose-related deleterious effect of any form of treatment on CD4 trend. The CD4 decrease was less when cryoprecipitate was administered alone or combined with concentrate, but not significantly so. Our results counter the assertion that low- and intermediate-purity products accelerate the rate of CD4 decrease in HIV-1-infected hemophiliacs."
10939,0.01,2.0000,"There is a lack of theory-based randomized controlled trials to examine the effect of antiretroviral adherence in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the effectiveness of a lay health worker lead structured group intervention to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a cohort of HIV-infected adults. This two-arm randomized controlled trial was undertaken at an HIV clinic in a district hospital in South Africa. A total of 152 adult patients on ART and with adherence problems were randomized 1:1 to one of two conditions, a standard adherence intervention package plus a structured three session group intervention or to a standard adherence intervention package alone. Self-reported adherence was measured using the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group adherence instrument prior to, post intervention and at follow-up. Baseline characteristics were similar for both conditions. At post-intervention, adherence information knowledge increased significantly in the intervention condition in comparison to the standard of care, while adherence motivation and skills did not significantly change among the conditions over time. There was a significant improvement in ART adherence and CD4 count and a significant reduction of depression scores over time in both conditions, however, no significant intervention effect between conditions was found. Lay health workers may be a useful adjunct to treatment to enhance the adherence information component of the medication adherence intervention, but knowledge may be necessary but not sufficient to increase adherence in this sample. Psychosocial informational interventions may require more advanced skill training in lay health workers to achieve superior adherence outcomes in comparison standard care in this resource-constrained setting."
18026,0.01,2.0000,"Chemotherapy regimens similar to those used for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) not associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been used for patients with HIV-associated NHL with less success. In a recent trial, patients with intermediate or high-grade NHL were randomized to either low-dose chemotherapy with methotrexate, bleomycin, doxorubicin, vincristine and dexamethasone (m-BACOD) or to standard-dose m-BACOD with sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, GM-CSF). With low-dose m-BACOD 41% of patients achieved a complete remission and the median survival was 35 weeks. With standard-dose m-BACOD and sargramostim, the percentage of complete remissions was 52% with a median survival of 31 weeks (P=n.s.). Myelosuppression was greater with standard-dose chemotherapy. In univariate and multivariate analyses of 21 pretreatment features of patients in this trial, four factors emerged as adversely prognostic with respect to survival: age >35 years, intravenous drug use, CD4 counts < 100/mm3 and stage III/IV disease. In an analysis using the proportional hazards model, a ""favorable"" group was defined by patients with 0 or 1 adverse factor (median survival 46 weeks, survival at 144 weeks 29.5%) as compared with an unfavorable group with 3 or 4 adverse factors (median survival 18 weeks, survival at 144 weeks 0). The outcome of these patients may be improving with the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which seems to improve immune function and tolerance of chemotherapy. A recent trial of the AIDS Malignancy Consortium found that low-dose chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone: CHOP) and standard-dose chemotherapy had similar response rates, acceptable toxicity and minimal alterations in cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and indinavir pharmacokinetics in HIV-associated lymphoma patients also on HAART (stavudine, lamivudine and indinavir). There is a suggestion that Burkitt-type lymphomas may tend to occur in HIV-infected patients with relatively well preserved immune function and CD4 cell counts. Recent results from our institution suggest that similar outcomes are achievable with intensive chemotherapy in patients with Burkitt's lymphomas with or without HIV infection. With improved immune status and improved bone marrow function with the use of HAART, it will probably become more possible to treat many patients with aggressive HIV-associated NHL with more intensive treatment regimens."
14494,0.01,2.0000,"Renal dysfunction is a severe complication of advanced HIV disease. We evaluated the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on renal function among HIV-infected Ugandans in the Home-Based AIDS Care clinical trial. The patients presented with symptomatic HIV disease or CD4 cell count < or = 250 cells/mm(3) and creatinine clearances above 25 ml/min determined by the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Of the 508 patients at baseline, 8% had a serum creatinine over 133 micromol/l and about 20% had reduced renal function evidenced by a creatinine clearance between 25 and 50 ml/min. After 2 years of HAART, the median serum creatinine was significantly decreased by 16% while the median creatinine clearance significantly increased 21%. The median creatinine clearance of patients with renal dysfunction at baseline, increased by 53% during 2 years of treatment. In multivariable analysis, a baseline creatinine above 133 micromol/l, a weight gain of more than 5 kg over the 2 years, female gender and a WHO stage 4 classification were all associated with greater improvements in creatinine clearance on HAART. Our study shows that renal dysfunction was common with advanced HIV disease in Uganda but this improved following 2 years of HAART."
4738,0.01,2.0000,"Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may lead to chronic HCV-infection with detectable HCV RNA or to spontaneous clearance with no HCV RNA, but detectable HCV antibodies. It is unknown whether HCV RNA status is associated with mortality in HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs). We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study to examine the impact of HCV RNA status on overall and cause-specific mortality in HIV-infected IDUs. We computed cumulative mortality and used Cox Regression to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRR). We identified 392 HIV-infected patients of whom 284 (72%) had chronic HCV-infection (HCV RNA positive patients) and 108 (28%) had cleared the HCV-infection (HCV RNA negative patients). During 1286 person-years of observation (PYR), 157 persons died (MR = 122/1000 PYR, 95% CI: 104-143). The estimated 5-year probabilities of survival were 0.58 (95% CI: 0.51-0.65) in the chronically HCV-infected and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.40-0.63) in the cleared HCV group. Chronic HCV-infection was not associated with overall mortality: MRR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.59-1.21. In HIV-infected Danish IDUs, chronic HCV-infection is not associated with increased mortality compared to patients who have cleared the infection."
11401,0.01,2.0000,Liver disease secondary to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the context of HIV infection is one of the leading non-AIDS causes of death. Sexual transmission of HCV infection among HIV-positive MSM appears to be leading to increased reports of acute HCV infection. Reinfection after successful treatment or spontaneous clearance is reported among HIV-positive MSM but the scale of reinfection is unknown. We calculate and compare HCV reinfection rates among HIV-positive MSM after spontaneous clearance and successful medical treatment of infection.
15329,0.01,2.0000,"We conducted a respondent driven sampling survey to estimate HIV prevalence and risk behavior among female sex workers (FSWs) in Nairobi, Kenya. Women aged 18 years and older who reported selling sex to a man at least once in the past 3 months were eligible to participate. Consenting FSWs completed a behavioral questionnaire and were tested for HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Adjusted population-based prevalence and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using RDS analysis tool. Factors significantly associated with HIV infection were assessed using log-binomial regression analysis. A total of 596 eligible participants were included in the analysis. Overall HIV prevalence was 29.5 % (95 % CI 24.7-34.9). Median age was 30 years (IQR 25-38 years); median duration of sex work was 12 years (IQR 8-17 years). The most frequent client-seeking venues were bars (76.6 %) and roadsides (29.3 %). The median number of clients per week was seven (IQR 4-18 clients). HIV testing was high with 86.6 % reported ever been tested for HIV and, of these, 63.1 % testing within the past 12 months. Of all women, 59.7 % perceived themselves at 'great risk' for HIV infection. Of HIV-positive women, 51.0 % were aware of their infection. In multivariable analysis, increasing age, inconsistent condom use with paying clients, and use of a male condom as a method of contraception were independently associated with unrecognized HIV infection. Prevalence among STIs was low, ranging from 0.9 % for syphilis, 1.1 % for gonorrhea, and 3.1 % for Chlamydia. The data suggest high prevalence of HIV among FSWs in Nairobi. Targeted and routine HIV and STI combination prevention strategies need to be scaled up or established to meet the needs of this population."
15342,0.01,2.0000,"To clarify risk factors for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) we selected at random 785 homosexual men who had participated in studies of hepatitis B in San Francisco in 1978-80 for a follow-up study of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Although most had not been contacted in over five years, 492 (63 per cent) were located and enrolled. The 240 (67 per cent) who had developed antibodies to HIV, as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were compared with 119 who had remained seronegative. In multivariate analyses, receptive anal intercourse with ejaculation by nonsteady sexual partners, many sexual partners per month, and other indicators of high levels of sexual activity were highly associated with seroconversions. None of the sexual practices that we studied appeared to offer protection against HIV infection."
15195,0.01,2.0000,"Study GS-99-907 was a 48-week, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled intensification trial of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF). Antiretroviral-experienced patients added tenofovir DF 300 mg once daily to their existing regimen. The patterns of HIV-1 resistance development and the corresponding virologic responses were evaluated in a virology substudy at week 48. Although 94% of these treatment-experienced patients had nucleoside-associated resistance mutations (NAMs) at baseline, addition of tenofovir DF resulted in a mean reduction in viral load of -0.59 log10 copies/mL after 24 weeks that was durable through 48 weeks. Relative to the placebo-controlled arm, patients in the tenofovir DF arm had a reduced frequency of development of resistance mutations to all classes of HIV-1 inhibitors, with reduction in new protease inhibitor (PI)-associated mutations achieving statistical significance. The K65R mutation, which occurred in 8 patients (3%), was the only emergent mutation directly associated with tenofovir DF therapy. New thymidine analogue-associated mutations (TAMs) emerged in 19% of patients by week 48. Other than K65R, the patterns of mutations that developed were not significantly different between the tenofovir DF and placebo control arms, suggesting that the background therapies caused their development. The K65R mutation emerged only in patients with no detectable TAMs at baseline, whereas new TAMs developed similarly between patients with or without TAMs at baseline. Development of K65R was associated with mostly low-level changes in phenotypic susceptibility to tenofovir DF and other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and was not associated with viral load rebound. No novel patterns of genotypic or phenotypic resistance to tenofovir were identified. Therefore, intensification with once-daily tenofovir DF therapy resulted in a sustained reduction in HIV-1 viral load and a low risk for development of the K65R mutation in this treatment-experienced patient population."
5487,0.01,2.0000,"Numerous alterations in endocrine function are observed in HIV infection. Direct destruction of endocrine organs by HIV itself or by invasive infection with opportunistic organisms resulting in loss of function is rare. When acutely ill, HIV patients can develop the metabolic derangements that accompany any severe systemic disorder. Studies of thyroid function tests emphasize that the presence of acute secondary infection must be analyzed when evaluating such patients. In addition to euthyroid sick syndrome other hormonal axes are affected by severe illness. These alterations may be cytokine mediated. As with seronegative patients, these changes can be transient and resolve with successful treatment of the intervening illness. Given the complexity of HIV disease, future reports should characterize patients by CD4 cell count, history of AIDS-indicating illnesses, and viral load. Viral burden is an independent predictor of immunosuppression and progression to AIDS. A large number of medications used in the treatment of HIV infection and related illnesses can alter endocrine function, mineral and electrolyte balance, and substrate turnover. Drug therapy must be considered in the evaluation of endocrine abnormalities in HIV-infected patients and carefully characterized in studies of these patients. The endocrine effects of medications used in the treatment of HIV infection are summarized in Table 3. Concomitant factors that affect endocrine function independent of the HIV virus can confound results in these patients. For example, opiate use affects PRL, gonadotropins, and cortisol response to ACTH stimulation. Investigations in HIV-infected patients must include careful descriptions of the study population and comparison to relevant controls. HIV-infected patients may also demonstrate more subtle alterations in endocrinological function in early, relatively asymptomatic, stages. The etiology and clinical significance of these changes, particularly their relationship to cytokines, continues to be investigated. The sequential studies of stable aldosterone levels despite decreased aldosterone response to ACTH stimulation indicate that alterations in response to provocative testing do not predict the development of hormonal insufficiency in this patient population. Similar longitudinal studies need to be done for the other hormonal axes to further delineate the endocrinological alterations in HIV infection. Finally, when the rationale for hormone replacement is debatable, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are necessary. Transient improvement in clinical status during open-label treatment does not prove hormone insufficiency. The long-term efficacy and safety of hormonal therapy must be demonstrated."
13025,0.01,2.0000,"Studies of heterosexual HIV transmission have consistently found anal intercourse to be a highly predictive risk factor for seroconversion. Yet most AIDS prevention messages targeted at heterosexuals, presumably influenced by cultural taboos against acknowledging this sexual practice, continue to emphasize vaginal and, increasingly, oral sex transmission. The health risks of anal sex appear to be severely underestimated by a substantial proportion of sexually active women and men in North and Latin America as well as parts of South Asia, Africa, and other regions. Among heterosexuals reported rates of condom use are nearly universally lower for anal than for vaginal intercourse. This review examines anal sex among the general population, including its prevalence in various world regions, related sociocultural factors, and other associated health problems including anorectal STDs, Hepatitis B infection, and HPV-related anal cancer in women. U.S. survey and other data suggest that, in terms of absolute numbers, approximately seven times more women than homosexual men engage in unprotected receptive anal intercourse. Research among higher risk subpopulations, including bisexual men, injecting drug users, female sex workers, inner-city adolescents, and serodiscordant heterosexual couples, indicates that persons particularly at risk of being infected by or transmitting HIV are also more likely to practice anal sex. Considering this finding, along with the much greater efficiency for HIV infection as well as lower rates of condom usage, a significant proportion of heterosexual transmission in some populations is due to anal intercourse. This typically stigmatized and hidden sexual practice must be given greater emphasis in AIDS/STD prevention, women's care, and other health promotion programs."
1161,0.01,2.0000,"Homelessness and unstable housing have been associated with HIV risk behavior and poorer health among persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), yet prior research has not tested causal associations. This paper describes the challenges, methods, and baseline sample of the Housing and Health Study, a longitudinal, multi-site, randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of providing immediate rental housing assistance to PLWHA who were homeless or at severe risk of homelessness. Primary outcomes included HIV disease progression, medical care access and utilization, treatment adherence, mental and physical health, and risks of transmitting HIV. Across three study sites, 630 participants completed baseline sessions and were randomized to receive either immediate rental housing assistance (treatment group) or assistance finding housing according to local standard practice (comparison group). Baseline sessions included a questionnaire, a two-session HIV risk-reduction counseling intervention, and blood sample collection to measure CD4 counts and viral load levels. Three follow-up visits occurred at 6, 12, and 18 months after baseline. Participants were mostly male, Black, unmarried, low-income, and nearly half were between 40 and 49 years old. At 18 months, 84% of the baseline sample was retained. The retention rates demonstrate the feasibility of conducting scientifically rigorous housing research, and the baseline results provide important information regarding characteristics of this understudied population that can inform future HIV prevention and treatment efforts."
13888,0.01,2.0000,"Clinical observations indicate that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive women experience more postoperative problems than do HIV-negative women. To obtain a better estimate of the individual risk of postoperative morbidity among HIV-infected women, and to determine which procedures pose the greatest risk, we performed a retrospective case-control study in which we assessed the outcomes after 235 obstetric and gynecologic surgical procedures. For purposes of comparison, an HIV-negative control patient was matched for each of the 235 surgical procedures performed, on the basis of the type of procedure and patient age. We found a significantly greater number of postoperative complications among the HIV-positive women. Higher complication rates occurred after abdominal surgery (odds ratio [OR], 3.6; P=.001) and curettage (OR, 7.7; P=.06). Among HIV-infected women, the risk of complications was associated with immune status. Antiretroviral therapy and standard perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis did not decrease the risk of complications. Indications for performing abdominal surgery and curettage on HIV-infected women should be carefully weighed against the potential risk of postoperative complications."
18045,0.01,2.0000,"This longitudinal qualitative study sought to understand how and why a livelihood intervention affected the health and health behaviors of HIV-infected Kenyan adults. The intervention included a microfinance loan, agricultural and financial training, and a human-powered water pump. In-depth interviews were conducted at two time points with intervention and control participants and program staff. We double coded interviews (n = 117) and used thematic content analysis of transcripts following an integrative inductive-deductive approach. Intervention participants described improvements in HIV health, including increased CD4 counts and energy, improved viral suppression, and fewer HIV-related symptoms. Better health was linked to improved clinic attendance and ART adherence through several mechanisms: (1) reductions in food insecurity and abject hunger; (2) improved financial stability; (3) improved productivity which enhanced social support; (4) better control over work situations; and, (5) renewed desire to prioritize their own health. Livelihood interventions may improve health by influencing upstream determinants of health behavior including food security and poverty."
17557,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients increasingly experience the consequences of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. This trial randomized 107 patients coinfected with HIV and HCV to receive 48 weeks of interferon alfa-2b (IFN) 3 million units three times weekly plus either a full course of ribavirin (RBV) at 800 mg/day (group A; n = 53) or 16 weeks of placebo, followed by RBV (group B; n = 54). The primary endpoint of sustained viral response (SVR) rate (undetectable HCV RNA at posttreatment week 24) was not different between groups A (11.3%) and B (5.6%; P =.32). Within group A, the SVR rate was lower in genotype 1 (2.5%) than in genotypes 2 through 4 (41.7%; P =.002). Fifty-five patients discontinued therapy prematurely, mostly because of adverse events or patient decisions. At treatment week 12, the percentage of CD4+ cells rose in group A (+4.1%; P <.001), but not in group B (-0.3%). A significant proportion (22%) of patients who were HIV viremic at baseline had undetectable HIV RNA at week 12. By week 16, the hemoglobin level decreased more in group A (-2,52 g/dL) than in group B (-1.02 g/dL; P <.001). In group A, the hemoglobin decline was steeper in patients receiving zidovudine (azidothymidine [AZT], -3.64 g/dL vs. no AZT, -2.08 g/dL), and patients receiving zidovudine had more anemia-related RBV dose reductions (AZT, 60% vs. no AZT, 16%). In conclusion, HCV therapy with IFN plus RBV is relatively safe in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV, but frequent treatment discontinuations and anemia-related RBV dose reductions contribute to a poor SVR rate. Control of HIV infection improves rather than worsens during therapy."

Exposure data were obtained from all participants by self-administered questionnaire and the odds ratios of possible risk factors of HCV infection analysed. Sixty-four cases consisted of forty-two patients with chronic hepatitis, nine with cirrhosis, one with hepatocellular carcinoma, and twelve with normal liver function. History of acute hepatitis (OR 3.9) and transfusion (OR 2.4) were associated with an increased risk of HCV infection. Operation, acupuncture, endoscopy, tooth extraction, tattooing, ear piercing, needle sharing and family history of hepatitis were not associated with an increased risk of HCV infection. In conclusion, transfusion remains the major route of transmission of HCV in Korea."

However, there are few and contradictory data about the effect of HCV carriage on the response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In this study, the recovery of CD4+ T cells following HAART among antiretroviral-naïve patients seropositive for HIV with and without HCV coinfection was investigated. Two hundred one HIV-infected patients without previous exposure to antiretroviral drugs were included in the study. HCV coinfection was detected in 123 (61%) patients. The time to recover 200 CD4+ cells/ microl was longer in the HCV-positive group ( P<0.001). In a Cox model, HCV infection and lack of persistent HIV viremia (defined as <200 copies/ml) were associated with the time to recover 200 CD4+ cells/ microl. The mean increase in CD4+ cell counts was lower in the HCV-positive group during the first year of therapy. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients naïve for antiretroviral therapy show a delayed recovery of CD4+ cell counts after starting HAART."
1895,0.005,1.0000,"To gauge the incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and associated risk factors among inmates during their imprisonment, the authors recruited adult males in a long-stay Scottish prison into a cohort study between April 1999 and October 2000. On two occasions (at 0 and 6 months), saliva was collected for anonymous HCV antibody testing and risk behavior data were obtained through a self-administered questionnaire. The participation rate was 85% at both initial recruitment (612/719) and follow-up (375/441; 171 men were ineligible for follow-up). For inmates who reported never having injected drugs, ever having injected drugs, having injected drugs during follow-up, and having shared needles/syringes during follow-up, HCV incidences per 100 person-years of incarceration risk were 1, 12, 19, and 27, respectively. Ever having injected drugs (relative risk = 13.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.5, 114.3) and having shared needles/syringes during follow-up (relative risk = 9.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 71.7) were significantly associated with HCV seroconversion. The effectiveness of existing interventions, including the provision of bleach tablets for sterilizing injection equipment, was suboptimal. The development of methadone maintenance programs in prisons and the creation of drug courts to keep offending drug injectors out of prison might help to reduce transmission in this setting."
8548,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission is related to blood transfusion and transmission in hemodialysis (HD) units. The aim of the study was to investigate the distribution of HCV genotypes and routes of HCV transmission in three groups of anti-HCV positive patients in north-west Croatia. A total of 111 patients were studied. Patients were classified into three groups: 45 HD patients with a low percentage of anti-HCV positivity (group 1), 60 HD patients treated at another HD unit and with high percentage of anti-HCV positivity (group 2), and six anti-HCV positive patients with chronic hepatitis (group 3). Most of the HD patients were treated during the sama shift, but with separate equipment. Serum HCV RNA was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Genotyping of HCV isolates was performed with a line-probe assay. Patients of groups 1 and 2 did not show significant differences with regard to the clinical profile. In group 1, all anti-HCV positive patients were RT-PCR positive and all of them were infected with the same genotype (genotype 3). In group 2, 89% of anti-HCV positive patients were RT-PCR positive and all infected with the same genotype (genotype 1 b). In group 3, 50% anti-HCV positive chronic hepatitis patients were RT-PCR positive. Two of them were infected with genotype 1 b and one with genotype 4. The homogeneity of HCV genotypes in the patients from both HD units (groups 1 and 2), seemed to indicate nosocomial transmission of HCV, whereas viremia was found to be related to blood transfusion in all group 3 patients. The exact mechanism involved in the transmission of HCV in HD units remains to be discovered."
327,0.005,1.0000,"The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HT). Although it is widely believed that virus infection and host immune response are involved in the pathogenic mechanisms, the role of the immune system in the development and/or maintenance of HT remains unknown. We performed an analysis of the peripheral blood leukocyte phenotype for two different subcohorts of HTLV-1-infected individuals to verify the existence of similar immunological alterations, possible laboratory markers for HT. The leukocyte population balance, the activation status of the T lymphocytes, and the cellular migratory potential of T lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils were evaluated in the peripheral blood of HTLV-1-infected individuals classified as asymptomatic individuals, oligosymptomatic individuals, and individuals with HT. Data analysis demonstrated that a decreased percentage of B cells, resulting in an increased T cell/B cell ratio and an increase in the CD8+ HLA-DR+ T lymphocytes, exclusively in the HT group could be identified in both subcohorts, suggesting its possible use as a potential immunological marker for HT for use in the laboratory. Moreover, analysis of likelihood ratios showed that if an HTLV-1-infected individual demonstrated B-cell percentages lower than 7.0%, a T cell/B cell ratio higher than 11, or a percentage of CD8+ HLA-DR+ T lymphocytes higher than 70.0%, this individual would have, respectively, a 12-, 13-, or 22-times-greater chance of belonging to the HT group. Based on these data, we propose that the T cell/B cell ratios and percentages of circulating B cells and activated CD8+ T lymphocytes in HTLV-1-infected patients are important immunological indicators which could help clinicians monitor HTLV-1 infection and differentiate the HT group from the asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic groups."

In the present study, primary human hepatocytes were fused with HepG2 cells to establish the hybrid HepCHLine-4 cell line with high susceptibility to HBV. The HepCHLine-4 cells expressed HBV-specific antigen when co-incubated with HBV-positive serum from a hepatitis B patient. Post-infection, HBV relaxed circular DNA and covalently closed circular DNA were detected in HepCHLine-4 cells using a nested polymerase chain reaction, and HBV-specific particles were visualized by electron microscopy of the culture media of HepCHLine-4 cells. HepG2 cells were not susceptible to HBV infection under the same conditions. The HepCHLine-4 cells can be sub-cultured for > 12 months while maintaining susceptibility to HBV and may, therefore, be useful for studying HBV infection and the viral life cycle in human hepatocytes."

8311,0.005,1.0000,"Adolescents living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately burdened by the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. Maintaining medication adherence is vital to ensuring that adolescents living with HIV/AIDS receive the benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART), although this group faces unique challenges to adherence. Knowledge of the factors influencing adherence among people during this unique developmental period is needed to develop more targeted and effective adherence-promoting strategies. This systematic review summarizes the literature on quantitative observational studies examining correlates, including risk and resilience-promoting factors, of ART adherence among adolescents living with HIV/AIDS in LMICs. A systematic search of major electronic databases, conference-specific databases, gray literature, and reference lists of relevant reviews and documents was conducted in May 2014. Included studies examined relationships between at least one factor and ART adherence as an outcome and were conducted in primarily an adolescent population (age 10-19) in LMICs. The search identified 7948 unique citations from which 15 studies fit the inclusion criteria. These 15 studies identified 35 factors significantly associated with ART adherence representing a total of 4363 participants across nine different LMICs. Relevant studies revealed few consistent relationships between measured factors and adherence while highlighting potentially important themes for ART adherence including the impact of (1) adolescent factors such as gender and knowledge of serostatus, (2) family structure, (3) the burdensome ART regimens, route of administration, and attitudes about medication, and (4) health care and environmental factors, such as rural versus urban location and missed clinic appointments. Rates of adherence across studies ranged from 16% to 99%. This review identifies unique factors significantly related to ART adherence among adolescents living in LMICs. More research using longitudinal designs and rigorous measures of adherence is required in order to identify the range of factors influencing ART adherence as adolescents living with HIV/AIDS in LMICs grow into adulthood."
1597,0.005,1.0000,"ICSBP is a member of the interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) family that regulates expression of type I interferon (IFN) and IFN-regulated genes. To study the role of the IRF family in viral infection, a cDNA for the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of ICSBP was stably transfected into U937 human monocytic cells. Clones that expressed DBD exhibited a dominant negative phenotype and did not elicit antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection upon IFN treatment. Most notably, cells expressing DBD were refractory to infection by vaccinia virus (VV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The inhibition of VV infection was attributed to defective virion assembly, and that of HIV-1 to low CD4 expression and inhibition of viral transcription in DBD clones. HIV-1 and VV were found to have sequences in their regulatory regions similar to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) to which IRF family proteins bind. Accordingly, these viral sequences and a cellular ISRE bound a shared factor(s) expressed in U937 cells. These observations suggest a novel host-virus relationship in which the productive infection of some viruses is regulated by the IRF-dependent transcription pathway through the ISRE."

This practice transformed HIV from a fatal disease to a more manageable chronic condition. However, relatively few studies focus on the experiences of survivors. This study provided a unique opportunity to interview patients who survived at least 10 years after being treated with ART at GHESKIO. The goal of the study was to elicit from patients their perspectives on what enabled them to survive with AIDS. Grounded Theory, a qualitative research method was used to guide data collection, coding, and analysis. Individual interviews were conducted, audio-taped, transcribed and analyzed in Creole, and translated into English. Data saturation was reached at 25 participants. Of which, 64% were women, the mean age was 49, range of 43-55 years, 24% were married, 44% had not completed elementary school, and 72% had no income, the remaining participants had incomes ranging from $1000 to $5000 annually. Qualitative analysis resulted in 681 codes, which were grouped into six categories: being spiritually grounded, having supportive interactions with providers, caring for children, setting personal goals, persevering and living life as usual, and maintaining strict medication adherence practices. The overarching theory was that having a reason to live despite one's circumstances and living life as usual enabled one to survive. Having a strong spiritual foundation coupled with supportive family and providers motivated participants to live and adhere to their ART. As the number of patients who are living longer with HIV in Haiti increases, results from this study will be important in helping tailor interventions that enhance their overall quality of life."

Multivariate Poisson regression models were used to determine factors independently associated with single ART drug discontinuation. Inverse probability weighting method to control for potential informative censoring was applied. Data from 10,637 patients were analyzed and 1,030 (9.7%) were HCV-Ab positive. Overall, there were 15,464 ART discontinuations due to any reason in 82,415.9 person-years of follow-up (PYFU) for an incidence rate (IR) of 18.8 (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 18.5-19.1) per 100 PYFU. No difference in IR of ART discontinuation due to any reason between HCV-infected and -uninfected patients was found. In a multivariable Poisson regression model, HCV-infected participants were at higher risk of darunavir/r discontinuation due to any reason (adjusted incidence rate ratio = 1.5, 95%CI 1.01-2.22, p value = 0.045) independently of demographics, HIV-related, ART and life-style factors. Among DRV/r treated patients, we found that HCV-viremic patients had twice the risk of ART discontinuation due to any reason than HCV-aviremic patients. In conclusion, HIV/HCV coinfected patients had a marginal risk increase of DRV/r discontinuation due to any reason compared with those without coinfection."

This study aimed to compare the morbidity, mortality, immunological and virological outcomes of antiretroviral therapy (ART) between HIV-infected patients with and without HCV co-infection in a setting where HCV infection is rarely treated. A retrospective cohort study was conducted among HIV-infected patients attending Ramathibodi Hospital between 1998 and 2008. We studied 171 HIV-infected patients 57 with and 114 without HCV co-infection. The mean age of patients was 34.6 years and 67.3% were males. There were no differences in demographics, HIV staging, CD4 counts, ART use and ART regimens between the two groups (p>0.05). All patients who had a CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 or had an AIDS-defining illness during following-up were given ART; these consisted of 84.2% and 88.6% of patients with and without HCV co-infection, respectively. Only 4 out of 57 (7%) HCV co-infected patients were treated for HCV infection. During a median (range) follow-up time of 2.9 (1.2-9.8) years, no patients died in either group. The rates of AIDS-defining illnesses and hospitalization in the two groups were similar (p>0.05). In a resource-limited setting where HCV treatment is not affordable, HCV co-infection does not appear to affect morbidity, mortality or treatment responses to ART. ART may have a greater impact than HCV co-infection on the survival of HCV/HIV co-infected patients. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term impact of HCV co-infection on clinical outcomes in HIV-infected patients without HCV treatment."
18421,0.005,1.0000,"Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) challenges the immune system with two viruses that elicit distinct immune responses. Chronic immune activation is a hallmark of HIV infection and an accurate indicator of disease progression. Suppressing HIV viremia by antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively prolongs life and significantly improves immune function. HIV/HCV coinfected individuals have peripheral immune activation despite effective ART control of HIV viral load. Here we examined freshly isolated CD14 monocytes for gene expression using high-density cDNA microarrays and analyzed T cell subsets, CD4 and CD8, by flow cytometry to characterize immune activation in monoinfected HCV and HIV, and HIV-suppressed coinfected subjects. To determine the impact of coinfection on cognition, subjects were evaluated in 7 domains for neuropsychological performance, which were summarized as a global deficit score (GDS). Monocyte gene expression analysis in HIV-suppressed coinfected subjects identified 43 genes that were elevated greater than 2.5 fold. Correlative analysis of subjects' GDS and gene expression found eight genes with significance after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Correlative expression of six genes was confirmed by qPCR, five of which were categorized as type 1 IFN response genes. Global deficit scores were not related to plasma lipopolysaccharide levels. In the T cell compartment, coinfection significantly increased expression of activation markers CD38 and HLADR on both CD4 and CD8 T cells but did not correlate with GDS. These findings indicate that coinfection is associated with a type 1 IFN monocyte activation profile which was further found to correlate with cognitive impairment, even in subjects with controlled HIV infection. HIV-suppressed coinfected subjects with controlled HIV viral load experiencing immune activation could benefit significantly from successful anti-HCV therapy and may be considered as preferential candidates."

Chronic hepatitis C evolves in a more aggressive form after transplantation, causing a worse survival. Twenty-one naïve patients with recurrent chronic hepatitis C demonstrated by biopsy were treated for 48 weeks with p-IFN alpha2b (1.5 microg/kg/wk) and RB (>10.6 mg/kg/d). Quantification of RNA was performed (Amplicor Cobas 2.0 Roche) at baseline, 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 weeks. A qualitative technique was used when quantitative levels were undetectable. At more than 1 year since liver transplantation we did not detect coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus or use steroid treatment. Among the cohort there were 16 men (76.2%). The mean overall age was 52 +/- 12 years. Time from liver transplant to treatment was 1637 +/- 1030 days. They were all infected with genotype 1. Eight patients received cyclosporine and the others tacrolimus. One patient was coinfected with hepatitis B virus and was receiving lamivudine. The mean initial histological activity index was 6.9 +/- 1.5 and fibrosis, 2.52 +/- 1.8 (Ishak). Two patients needed spleen embolization before the treatment. Two patients had to stop the treatment: one due to clinical intolerance, and the other one due to a cholangitis. In 14%, p-IFN doses were adjusted. In 32% RB was adjusted. Five (23.8%) did not respond at 24 weeks. Fourteen (66.7%) showed end-treatment responses but four relapsed at 72 weeks. A sustained viral response was achieved in 9 (42.8%).

7215,0.005,1.0000,"To examine the variables associated with heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), we studied 32 couples in our hemophilia center who had steady sexual relationships for periods more than 1 year. Of the 32 sexual partners of the hemophiliacs, five (15.6%) were HIV seropositive. All five hemophiliacs with HIV transmission to their sexual partners had measurable immunologic deficiencies, as shown by their lower median T-helper (CD-4+) lymphocyte count of 172 cells/mm3. The hemophiliacs without transmission had a slightly higher median CD-4+ count of 297 cells/mm3 (P = .26). To determine if factors other than the degree of immunologic deficiency in the hemophiliac might contribute to HIV transmission, 18 of the 32 couples were studied more intensively by confidential, coded questionnaires. Regular condom use was reported by nine couples (50%). Two of nine women (22%) without condom usage acquired HIV. One of nine women (11%) using condoms was seropositive; she also reported eight needlestick injuries while assisting her spouse with clotting factor treatments. Intravenous drug abuse was reported in two of the five couples with HIV transmission. Thus, hemophiliacs are at risk for transmitting HIV parenterally as well as venereally. Despite various risk behaviours associated with HIV transmission, the prevalence of infection in our cohort of hemophiliacs' sexual partners is low and within the range (6.8-22%) reported by others. This study underscores the need for comprehensive education and counseling in what previously appeared to be a homogeneous clinic population at risk for transmitting HIV to others."

Both men had end-stage HIV infection, one with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and one with severe AIDS-related complex (ARC). Loss of the inhibitor was associated with a fall in T4 helper lymphocytes to less than 100 per mm3 in both patients. Subsequent spontaneous and traumatic hemorrhages were treated successfully with standard doses of FVIII concentrate, resulting in adequate FVIII:C levels and good hemostasis. The mechanism by which the anti-FVIII inhibitor disappears is not known, but it is likely to be related to a quantitative decline in T4 cell number."

Although CBT-BISC has demonstrated preliminary efficacy in improving ART adherence, the mechanisms of change are unknown. Utilizing data from a two-armed randomized controlled trial (N = 44 sexual minority men living with HIV), comparing CBT-BISC to an enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) condition, sequential process mediation via latent difference scores was assessed, with changes in body image disturbance entered as the mechanism between treatment condition and changes in ART adherence. Participants assigned to CBT-BISC reported statistically significant reductions in body image disturbance post-intervention, which subsequently predicted changes in ART adherence from post-intervention to long term follow-up (b = 20.01, SE = 9.11, t = 2.19, p = 0.028). One pathway in which CBT-BISC positively impacts ART adherence is through reductions in body image disturbance.

5288,0.005,1.0000,"The association of HIV infection and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection often occurs because both viruses share the same transmission routes, increasing the possibility of HIV/HCV coinfection. World prevalence greater than 30% of coinfected cases is estimated, and it can reach 90% depending on the transmission route. With the aim of determining the frequency and profile of HIV/HCV coinfected patients, a descriptive analysis was carried out with patients with HIV/AIDS whose serology was positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV), cared for at the Fundação de Medicina Tropical do Amazonas from 2000 to 2007. In the present study, of the 2,653 AIDS cases notified in SINAN, 1,582 patients underwent serology test for hepatitis C, and a frequency of 4.42% (n = 70) of HIV/HCV coinfected patients was identified in the period studied. The most frequent infection route was sexual transmission (84.3%), 68.6% among heterosexual individuals. Most patients were males (72.9%), aged between 25 and 40 years (60.1%), of low income (50% earning up to one minimum wage), and low educational level (80% had completed only middle school). A high percentage of deaths were observed during the study (34.3%). The results indicate a low seroprevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection in this population, in which sexual transmission, characterized by sexual promiscuity among heterosexual individuals, is the major transmission route of the virus rather than the use of injection drugs, as shown in world statistics."

The ratio of biochemical evidence of liver cell necrosis (ALAT)/viral replication (DNAp) was significatively decreased (p less than 0.01), despite evidence of severe histological damage in some cases. Two-thirds of patients with HBV replication tolerated HBV infection at the end of follow-up. This tolerance was significatively more common than in homosexuals infected by HBV alone (p less than 0.01), and did not appear to be related to decreased T4 cell count but seemed to correlate with the existence of the AIDS related complex."

We analyzed data from 347 hepatitis B e antigen-negative and 238 hepatitis B e antigen positive patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in an open-label, longterm extension of two phase 3 studies. To date, resistance analyses have been completed for patients receiving up to 288 weeks (6 years) of TDF. Population sequencing of hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase/reverse transcriptase (pol/RT) was attempted for all patients at baseline, and any patient who remained viremic (HBV DNA 400 copies/mL [69 IU/mL]) at week 288 or at the end of treatment with TDF (n552) or emtricitabine(FTC)/TDF (n57). Phenotypic analyses were performed in HepG2 cells using recombinant HBV containing patient pol/RT sequences. Approximately half of the patients on open-label treatment who qualified for genotyping had pol/RT sequence changes compared to baseline (23/52 [44%] on TDF, 4/7 [57%] on FTC/TDF). Most changes were at polymorphic sites and none were associated with TDF resistance. Virologic breakthrough occurred infrequently and was associated with nonadherence to study medication in the majority of cases (12/16, 75%). Per protocol, 57 patients (10%)were eligible to switch to FTC/TDF; the majority had HBV DNA <400 copies/mL at their last study visit regardless of whether they switched to FTC/TDF (n534) or maintained TDF monotherapy (n517).

The objective of this study was to characterize the in vitro susceptibility profiles of a large panel of clinically derived HIV-1 isolates for tenofovir. The distribution of tenofovir susceptibilities in over 1,000 antiretroviral-naive, HIV-1-infected individuals worldwide was determined using the Virco Antivirogram assay. In addition, phenotypic susceptibilities to tenofovir and other RT inhibitors were determined in a panel of nearly 5,000 recombinant HIV-1 clinical isolates from predominantly treatment-experienced patients analyzed as a part of routine drug resistance testing. Greater than 97.5% of isolates from treatment-naive patients had tenofovir susceptibilities <3-fold above those of the wild-type controls by the Antivirogram. The clinically derived panel of 5,000 samples exhibited a broad range of antiretroviral drug susceptibilities, including 69, 43, and 16% having >10-fold-decreased susceptibilities to at least one, two, and three antiretroviral drug classes, respectively. Greater than 88% of these 5,000 clinical isolates were within the threefold susceptibility range for tenofovir, and >99% exhibited <10-fold-reduced susceptibilities to tenofovir. Decreased susceptibility to tenofovir was not directly associated with resistance to other RT inhibitors; r(2) values of log-log linear regression plots of susceptibility to tenofovir versus susceptibility to other RT inhibitors were <0.4. The results suggest that the majority of treatment-naive and treatment-experienced individuals harbor HIV that remains within the normal range of tenofovir susceptibilities and may be susceptible to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy."
16111,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has a variable course leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The pathogenesis and clinical outcome of HBV infection are strictly dependent on both viral factors, such as life cycle and genotypic variants, and host immune response (i.e. viral persistence). Although therapy of hepatitis B is evolving, which between single and/or combined agents are most effective, how long therapy should last, which criteria should be used to start or continue and switch or stop therapy are to be defined. Two major groups of therapies are currently utilized for chronic hepatitis: immunomodulatory (interferons) and antivirals (nucleoside and nucleotide analogues), all with their own advantages and limitations. In fact, the development of specific antiviral therapies has provoked the appearance of a relevant problem: drug resistances. The emerged antiviral drug-resistant strains of HBV leads to a poor prognosis for infected patients. Thus, many basic and clinical research challenges remain in defining optimal means of management of viral hepatitis B and its related liver diseases. This paper provides a review of new available and developing treatment options for HBV associated liver diseases. In the near future the most realistic therapeutic option for the majority of patients with HBV infection will be combination and/or long-term use of new and stronger antiviral drugs, if they maintain good safety profiles, achieve low resistance rates and will be available at lower prices."

In addition, association of polymorphisms with immunologic and virologic factors was investigated. A 207bp of MDR1 exon 26 and a 161bp of CYP2B6 exon 4 were obtained from patients by polymerase chain reaction. Analysis of population-based sequences of MDR1 revealed a frequency of 89% and 11% of C and T alleles respectively (n=197; X<formula>^{2} =</formula> 0.974; p=0.324).

Among 488 HIV-seropositive intravenous drug users with a median follow-up of 32.5 months, high levels of serum 90K at baseline proved to be a significant predictor of faster progression to AIDS, either as a continuous variable (log 90K; p < 0.0001) or as a dichotomous variable with an optimized cutoff point of 30 U/ml (p < 0.00001). Analysis of 90K in relation to known prognostic factors found an association with CD4 count, beta 2-microglobulin, and p24 antigen but none with neopterin. In multivariate analysis, the baseline 90K level was an independent predictor of AIDS. As compared with subjects with low levels of 90K, the relative risk of developing AIDS was 3.5 (95% CI 1.9-6.5) among those with high levels of 90K. The predictive value of 90K was maintained after stratification by baseline CD4 count: among subjects with > or = 500 x 10(6)/L CD4 cells, the proportion in whom AIDS developed was 10.5% for those with 90K levels < or = 30 U/ml as compared with 20% for those with 90K above the cutoff point (p = 0.006). Serum 90K is an independent predictor of the risk for progression to AIDS in HIV-infected subjects, including those whose CD4 counts have not fallen."
6280,0.005,1.0000,"The introduction of potent combinations of antiviral drugs is a major breakthrough in the treatment of HIV. We investigated the long-term virologic outcome and the development of resistance after initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in drug-naive patients in daily clinical practice. Twenty-five treatment-naive HIV-1 patients were started on HAART. Fifteen patients responded with a drop in viral load below the limit of detection during 35.5 (interquartile range: 7) months of therapy. In 6 of 10 patients with virologic failure, virus with resistance-related mutations against the received drugs emerged. Compared with responders (R), nonresponding (NR) patients were in a later disease stage at therapy start (p = 0.0089) with lower CD4 cell counts at baseline (p = 0.040), and a lower proportion of nonresponders showed protease inhibitor (PI) levels above C(min) (p = 0.049). More NR patients showed secondary PI mutations at baseline (p = 0.079), and the CCR2-64I coreceptor polymorphism was absent among NR patients, compared with 38.5% of R patients displaying CCR2-64I (p = 0.053), although the differences were not significant. In conclusion, starting HAART in antiretroviral drug-naive HIV-infected patients followed in daily clinical practice prevented viral breakthrough for up to 44 months in 60% of the patients.

The current study examined relationships between caregivers' individual and social network characteristics and care recipient viral suppression. Baseline data were from the BEACON study caregivers and their HIV seropositive former or current drug using care recipients, of whom 89 % were African American (N = 258 dyads). Using adjusted logistic regression, care recipient's undetectable viral load was positively associated with caregiver's limited physical functioning and negatively associated with caregivers having few family members to turn to for problem solving, a greater number of current drug users in their network, and poorer perceptions of the care recipient's mental health. Results further understandings of interpersonal relationship factors important to PLHIV's health outcomes, and the need for caregiving relationship-focused intervention to promote viral suppression among PLHIV.

1769,0.005,1.0000,"Tenofovir, an antihuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug, has activity against lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants. To describe the efficacy of tenofovir in patients with lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B we applied two investigative approaches based on mathematical models of viral dynamics: the individual nonlinear fitting and the mixed-effect group fitting approaches. Eleven chronic HBV patients on lamivudine for a median of 176 weeks (range: 72-382) with YMDD mutation-related HBV-DNA breakthrough received 'add-on' tenofovir 300 mg once-daily, while maintaining their existing therapy. Sequential sera were taken at day 1 (t = 0 and t = 8 h), days 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28 and every 4 weeks thereafter, and HBV-DNA levels were assessed using a validated quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Median baseline log HBV-DNA was 8.62 (range: 6.48-9.76 log HBV-DNA). Tenofovir treatment resulted in a mean (+/-SD) log HBV-DNA decline of 1.37 +/- 0.51 in the first phase, 2.54 +/- 0.91 after 4 weeks, and 4.95 +/- 0.90 log HBV-DNA after 24 weeks. The median effectiveness of blocking viral replication in the individual fit model was 93% (range: 73-99) for eta = 0 and 93% (range: 59-99) for eta = 1. There was only a small difference between the efficacy parameter 'epsilon' of the individual nonlinear fitting and mixed-effect group fitting on the biphasic exponential model. These data show that tenofovir has good efficacy in blocking viral replication in HBV patients with lamivudine-induced drug-resistant HBV mutants, but effectiveness varies greatly among individuals. Both models can be used to describe viral decay during tenofovir therapy."
3402,0.005,1.0000,"Retroviruses are membrane-enveloped, RNA-containing viruses that produce a wide range of threatening diseases in higher animals. Among these are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which produces acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans, and murine leukemia virus (MuLV), which produces leukemias in rodents. We have obtained the first atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of these two retroviruses, both isolated from culture media and emerging from infected cell surfaces. The HIV virions are 127 nm diameter on average, and those of MuLV are 145 nm, although there are wide distributions about the means. The AFM images show the arrangement of the envelope protein, responsible for host cell entry, on the surfaces of both virions. Disruption of the viruses using detergents or physical means allowed us to visualize interior structures, including the outer shells of both MuLV and HIV, the cores of MuLV, and the nucleic acid of HIV complexed with core proteins. Using immunolabeling techniques borrowed from electron microscopy, we were able to demonstrate the binding of gold-labeled antibodies directed against the envelope protein of MuLV. The AFM images are revealing, not only in terms of surface topology, but in terms of interior features as well, and they reveal the eccentricities and uniqueness of individual virus particles rather than yielding the average member of the population. Further application of AFM to viruses associated with other pathologies may ultimately have a significant impact on the diagnosis and treatment of virus-promoted diseases."
9698,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has resulted in a substantial improvement in the morbidity and mortality associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. As this population ages, cardiovascular disease is becoming an increasingly important health burden. It is clear that many factors are involved in the development of this problem, with traditional risk factors (smoking, dyslipidemia, diabetes, family history, hypertension) the main contributors. ART and HIV infection itself can modify the risk of cardiovascular disease. Not only does this increased risk seem to be mediated through effects on traditional cardiovascular risk factors, namely dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, but there is also some evidence that HIV and ART may be associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction. Current data are conflicting and further investigation into this area is needed. Drugs from both nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and protease inhibitor classes have been demonstrated to increase cardiovascular risk; however these effects are variable not only between classes but also between drugs in the same class. As newer therapies become available (in existing and new drug classes), the cardiovascular impact of these will need careful evaluation. Currently published guidelines suggest regular monitoring of cardiovascular risks (both before and after commencing ART) and pre-emptive treatment. Existing risk assessment tools have not been fully validated in an HIV setting and need to be used with caution. Lifestyle modification, in the first instance, and pharmacological intervention to reduce traditional risk factors are important management strategies. Initiating, or switching to, ART with a lower potential for metabolic derangement should also be considered."

It is important that providers control this condition, as the persistence of diarrhea affects the quality of life of patients and may contribute to decreased adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Strategies to control diarrhea in patients with HIV infection include switching to a new antiretroviral regimen and/or the use of specific medications to control the diarrhea. This review aims to provide a concise evaluation of a newly approved medication (crofelemer) that has a novel mechanism of action and has received approval for the symptomatic relief of non-infectious diarrhea in adult patients with HIV on anti-retroviral therapy.

19888,0.005,1.0000,"Transfusion-transmissible infections including HIV-1 continue to pose major risks for unsafe blood transfusions due to both window phase infections and divergent viruses that may not be detected by donor screening assays. Given the recent emergence of several HIV-1 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) in high-risk populations in the Southeast Asia region, we investigated the genetic diversity of HIV-1 among the blood donors in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A total of 211 HIV-positive plasma samples detected among 730,188 donations to the National Blood Centre between 2013 and 2014 were provided (90.5% male, median age: 27.0 years old). Recent or long-term infection status at the time of donation was determined using a limiting antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay (LAg-Avidity EIA). HIV-1 gag-pol genes were amplified and sequenced from residual plasma for 149 cases followed by genotype determination using phylogenetic and recombination analyses. Transmitted antiretroviral resistance mutations were not observed among the blood donors, among which 22.7% were classified as recent or incident infections. Major circulating HIV-1 genotypes determined by neighbour-joining phylogenetic inference included CRF01_AE at 40.9% (61/149), CRF33_01B at 21.5% (32/149), and subtype B at 10.1% (15/149). Newly-described CRFs including CRF54_01B circulated at 4.0%, CRF74_01B at 2.0%, and CRF53_01B and CRF48_01B at 0.7% each. Interestingly, unique HIV-1 genotypes including African subtype G (8.7%), CRF45_cpx (1.3%), CRF02_AG (0.7%) and CRF07_BC (0.7%) from China were detected for the first time in the country. A cluster of subtype G sequences formed a distinct founder sub-lineage within the African strains. In addition, 8.7% (13/149) of HIV-infected donors had unique recombinant forms (URFs) including CRF01_AE/B' (4.7%), B'/C (2.7%) and B'/G (1.3%) recombinants. Detailed analysis identified similar recombinant structures with shared parental strains among the B'/C and B'/G URFs, some of which were sequenced from recently infected individuals, indicating the possible emergence and on-going spread of foreign clades of CRF candidates among the local population. The findings demonstrate extensive molecular complexity of HIV-1 among the infected blood donors in Malaysia, driven in part by the increased spread of recently described CRFs and multiple introductions of previously unreported genotypes from highly prevalent countries.

19547,0.005,1.0000,"Indinavir therapy has demonstrated promise in the treatment of HIV-1 infection in clinical trials; however, its efficacy in a U.S. Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where access to therapy is generally unimpeded, is unknown. A review of the Miami cohort was conducted for the year beginning May 1996 to evaluate response to indinavir plus two nucleoside analogues. Of 483 HIV-1-positive patients (97% male; mean age, 46.7+/-9.7 years), 266 were offered indinavir based on their having CD4 counts <200 cells/microl or viral loads >10,000 copies/ml. Of these patients, 36% were adherent and experienced significant reductions in viral loads (-93,325+/-147,911 copies/ml) and elevations in CD4+ (111+/-103 cells/microl) and CD8+ (225+/-338 cells/microl) T cell counts. Adherent patients with baseline CD4 counts <100 cells/microl were 4.5 times more likely to have follow-up viral loads >10,000 copies/ml than those with CD4 >200 cells/microl. Adherent patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/microl did not show evidence of immune ""exhaustion"" because they were equal to those with CD4 counts >200 cells/microl in their capacity to replenish CD4 cells. Nonadherence to the regimen resulted in loss of therapeutic benefit and suggested that strategies to enhance adherence may become an essential component of treatment."
14963,0.005,1.0000,"In both clinical trials and clinical practice, nonadherence to medications is widespread among patients with chronic diseases. The shift to combination therapies for treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals has increased adherence challenges for both patients and health-care providers. Estimates of average rates of nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy range from 50% to 70%. Adherence rates of <80% are associated with detectable viremia in a majority of patients. The principal factors associated with nonadherence appear to be patient-related, including substance and alcohol abuse. However, other factors may also contribute, such as inconvenient dosing frequency, dietary restrictions, pill burden, and side effects; patient-health-care provider relationships; and the system of care. We discuss the major reasons reported by HIV-infected individuals for not taking their medications. Improving adherence probably requires clarifying the treatment regimen and tailoring it to patient lifestyles."
12249,0.005,1.0000,"AIDS deaths among adolescents are increasing globally. This qualitative study investigated the barriers and facilitators to cART adherence among Peruvian adolescents living with HIV.

Most barriers and facilitators to cART adherence clustered at the individual and family/caregiver levels, centering on support provided to adolescents; history of declining health due to suboptimal cART adherence; side effects from antiretroviral drugs; and cART misinformation. Interventions to support adolescent HIV cART adherence should begin at the individual and family/caregiver levels and include an educational component. No adolescent living with HIV should die from AIDS in an era of accessible cART."
12914,0.005,1.0000,"Consistent individual effort in engagement in HIV medical services has been associated with positive health outcomes in people living with HIV (PLHIV). However, whether these benefits are facilitated by improved medication adherence has not been widely studied. This study aimed to investigate the marginal effect of engagement in HIV care on medication adherence at a public health facility in Kenya. Between February and April 2013, 392 patients on HIV care at Nyeri Provincial General Hospital participated in this study. Data were collected using a self-administered health survey questionnaire assessing health and sociodemographic statuses. A manual stepwise general linear model was specified to measure the effect of engagement in HIV and other associated predictors on medication adherence. Engagement in HIV care was significantly associated with log-transformed medication adherence in the sample (100·β = 9.2%, 95% CI 3.2-15.1) irrespective of gender and other selected predictors. Longer duration on antiretroviral therapy was also a significant predictor of better medication adherence (100·β = 3.2%, 95% CI 2.3-4.1). Despite inter-gender differences in adherence and engagement determinants, gender's independent effect on medication adherence and engagement in care were not statistically significant. Poor medication adherence was associated with lower patient engagement in HIV care services, suggesting that interventions which remove obstacles to regular observance of scheduled clinic appointments and eventual retention may have a beneficial impact on medication adherence and, accordingly, health outcomes in PLHIV.

10954,0.005,1.0000,"Current WHO guidelines recommend lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV-positive individuals, including pregnant and breastfeeding women (Option B+) in settings with generalized HIV epidemics. While Option B+ is scaled-up in Kenya, insufficient adherence and retention to care could undermine the expected positive impact of Option B+. To explore challenges to the provision of Option B+ at the health facility level, we conducted forty individual gender-matched in-depth interviews with HIV-positive pregnant/postpartum women and their male partners, and four focus groups with thirty health care providers at four health facilities in western Kenya between September-November 2014. Transcripts were coded with the Dedoose software using a coding framework based on the literature, topics from interview guides, and emerging themes from transcripts. Excerpts from broad codes were then fine-coded using an inductive approach. Three major themes emerged: 1) Option B+ specific challenges (same-day initiation into treatment, health care providers unconvinced of the benefits of Option B+, insufficient training); 2) facility resource constraints (staff and drug shortages, long queues, space limitations); and 3) lack of client-friendly services (scolding of patients, inconvenient operating hours, lack of integration of services, administrative requirements). This study highlights important challenges at the health facility level related to Option B+ rollout in western Kenya. Addressing these specific challenges may increase linkage, retention and adherence to life-long ART treatment for pregnant HIV-positive women in Kenya, contribute towards elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission, and improve maternal and child outcomes."
11641,0.005,1.0000,"Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has changed the clinical course of HIV. AIDS-defining conditions (ADC) are suggestive of severe or advanced disease and are a leading cause of HIV-related hospitalizations and death among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in the USA. Optimal adherence to cART can mitigate the impact of ADC and disease severity on the health and survivability of PLWHA. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between ADC at HIV diagnosis and optimal adherence among PLWHA. Using data from the 2008 and 2009 Medicaid data from 29 states, we identified individuals, between 18 and 49 years, recently infected with HIV and with a cART prescription. Frequencies and descriptive statistics were conducted to characterize sample. Univariate and multivariable Poisson regression analyses were employed to evaluate the association optimal cART adherence (defined as ≥ 95% study days covered by cART) and ADC at HIV diagnosis (≥1 ADC) were assessed. Approximately 17% of respondents with ADC at HIV diagnosis reported optimal cART adherence. After adjusting for covariates, respondents with an ADC at HIV diagnosis were less likely to report optimal cART adherence (adjusted prevalence ratio (APR) = 0.64, 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.54-0.75). Among the covariates, males (APR=1.10, 95% CI, 1.02-1.19) compared to females were significantly more likely to report optimal adherence while younger respondents, 18-29 years (APR=0.67, 95% CI, 0.57-0.77), 30-39 years (APR=0.86, 95% CI, 0.79-0.95) compared to older respondents were significantly less likely to report optimal adherence. PLWHA with ADC at HIV diagnosis are at risk of suboptimal cART adherence. Multiple adherence strategies that include healthcare providers, case managers, and peer navigators should be utilized to improve cART adherence and optimize health outcomes among PLWHA with ADC at HIV diagnosis. Targeted adherence programs and services are required to address suboptimal adherence in this population."
7708,0.005,1.0000,"South Africa has the largest global HIV/AIDS epidemic, but barriers along the HIV care continuum prevent patients from initiating and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART). To qualitatively explore reasons for poor ART initiation and adherence rates from the unique perspective of community health workers (CHWs), we conducted focus groups during May-August 2014 with 21 CHWs in rural Msinga, KwaZulu-Natal. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated from Zulu into English. Hybrid deductive and inductive analytical methods were applied to identify emergent themes. Multiple psychosocial, socioeconomic, and socio-medical barriers acted at the level of the individual, social network, broader community, and healthcare environment to simultaneously hinder initiation of and adherence to ART. Key themes included insufficient patient education and social support, patient dissatisfaction with healthcare services, socioeconomic factors, and tension between ART and alternative medicine. Fear of lifelong therapy thwarted initiation whereas substance abuse principally impeded adherence. In conclusion, HIV/AIDS management requires patient counselling and support extending beyond initial diagnosis. Treating HIV/AIDS as a chronic rather than acute infectious disease is key to improving ART initiation and long-term adherence. Public health strategies include expanding CHWs' roles to strengthen healthcare services, provide longitudinal patient support, and foster collaboration with alternative medicine providers."
19525,0.005,1.0000,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health problem in developed countries with over 17 million deaths per year. In the last decade, several infectious agents rather than any single pathogen, including Chlamydia pneumoniae and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have been shown to contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events by inducing systemic inflammation and/or acting directly on the vascular wall. For the first time, we evaluated C. pneumonia DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV patients by real-time polymerase chain reaction in order to shed light on C. pneumonia as a co-factor with HIV in the development of CVDs. C. pneumonia DNA was not detected in our virologically suppressed HIV patients (<37 copies/mL). This finding may be related to high CD4+T cell count (>500 cells/μl) found in HIV patients suggesting functional cell-mediated immunity as a fundamental mechanism for the clearance of chlamydial infection in this population. Larger studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis."

We determined the prevalence and factors associated with incidental findings on CT scans performed to screen for coronary artery calcium (CAC) among HIV-infected men. A clinically significant finding was defined as requiring additional workup or a medical referral. A total of 215 HIV-infected men were evaluated. Their median age was 43 years; 17% were current tobacco users; the median CD4 count was 580 cells/mm(3); and 83% were receiving antiretroviral medications. Also, 34% had a positive CAC score of >0. An incidental finding was noted among 93 participants (43%), with 36 (17%) having ≥1 clinically significant finding. A total of 139 findings were noted, most commonly pulmonary nodules, followed by granulomas, scarring, and hilar adenopathy. Most of the incidental findings were stable on follow-up, and no malignancies were detected. The factors associated with the presence of an incidental finding in the multivariate model included increasing age (odds ratio 1.6 per 10 years, p <0.01), positive CAC score (odds ratio 2.3, p <0.01), and current tobacco use (odds ratio 2.5, p = 0.02).

This population of MCs/basophils can be maintained ex vivo for at least 2 weeks, and a comparable population of cells can be generated in vitro from nongranulated hematopoietic CD3(-)/CD4(+)/CD117(-) progenitors. Both populations of MCs/basophils are susceptible to an M-tropic strain of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). Finally, many patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome have HIV-1-infected MCs/basophils in their peripheral blood.

In contrast to previous reports, drug-resistant virus was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a few of the patients who had never received AZT. The AZT resistance of HIV-1 isolates from one untreated individual was confirmed by further susceptibility studies in vitro and by the finding of a characteristic mutation (Lys-->Arg at codon 70) in the reverse transcriptase. In patients who were clinically stable while on AZT, HIV-1 titers in plasma and mononuclear cells were generally low but resistant viruses already predominated. In those individuals who were deteriorating despite AZT administration, high levels of viremia were observed, and the resistance phenotype was nearly universal. These findings serve to emphasize the magnitude of the AZT-resistance problem in patients on drug treatment."

Furthermore, several of the highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) used to reduce levels of circulating HIV and extend acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related survival are associated with a rise in plasma lipids. Anecdotal reports suggest such rises may be linked to cardiovascular complications. Herein, we review the case of a 74-year-old HIV-infected man with advanced coronary artery disease. He was prescribed simvastatin for control of hyperlipidemia and within 4 weeks developed muscle pain, proximal muscle weakness, myoglobinuria, and a markedly elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). Simvastatin was discontinued, and rhabdomyolysis improved rapidly with conservative care. This report emphasizes this rare, but potentially significant, side effect of statin anticholesterol agents.

To assess the level of knowledge and the associated attitudes about AIDS among Indians in Calcutta, 153 English-speaking adults were surveyed during April and May 1990. Sixty-five of 75 men (87%) and 77 of 78 women (99%) questioned had heard of AIDS, the majority within the past 2-3 years. Newspaper and television were the most frequently cited sources of information. Of respondents who had heard of the disease, 95% knew AIDS was transmitted by sexual intercourse; less than half, however, also knew that AIDS could not be acquired through kissing, insect bites or by using public toilets. In general, respondents had little specific knowledge regarding the symptoms of AIDS, and 29% were unaware that infected persons could be asymptomatic and appear healthy. Level of education was the only variable that independently correlated with knowledge of AIDS. More than one-third of respondents would not have dinner with or continue to work with an AIDS patient and 50% believed all AIDS patients should be quarantined. More effective and widespread public education is necessary to help slow the rapidly developing AIDS epidemic in India."
17753,0.005,1.0000,"Research linking psychological inhibition to physical illness led us to examine whether human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection might progress more rapidly among gay men who conceal their homosexual identity than among those who do not. We also sought to determine whether any accelerated course of HIV infection among ""closeted"" gay men might be attributable to differences in health-relevant behavior (e.g., health practices, sexual behavior) or psychosocial characteristics (e.g., depression, anxiety, social support, repressive coping style). Data came from a longitudinal psychosocial study associated with the Los Angeles site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Eighty gay men, HIV-seropositive but otherwise healthy at study entry (CD4 T lymphocytes = 30-60% of total lymphocytes), were examined at 6-month intervals for 9 years. Indicators of HIV progression included time to a critically low CD4 T lymphocyte level (15% of total peripheral blood lymphocytes), time to AIDS diagnosis, and time to AIDS mortality. On all measures, HIV infection advanced more rapidly in a dose-response relationship to the degree participants concealed their homosexual identity. Sample characteristics and statistical controls ruled out explanations based on demographic characteristics, health practices, sexual behavior, and antiretroviral therapy. Mediational analyses indicated that observed effects were not attributable to differences in depression, anxiety, social support, or repressive coping style. HIV infection appears to progress more rapidly in gay men who conceal their homosexual identity. These results are consistent with hypotheses about the health effects of psychological inhibition, but further research is required to definitively identify the psychosocial, behavioral, and physiological mechanisms underlying these findings."
734,0.005,1.0000,"The availability of an increasing number of antiretroviral agents and the rapid evolution of new information has introduced substantial complexity into treatment regimens for persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation convened the Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV to develop guidelines for clinical management of HIV-infected adults and adolescents (CDC. Report of the NIH Panel To Define Principles of Therapy of HIV Infection and Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected adults and adolescents. MMWR 1998;47[RR-5]:1-41). This report, which updates the 1998 guidelines, addresses 1) using testing for plasma HIV ribonucleic acid levels (i.e., viral load) and CD4+ T cell count; 2) using testing for antiretroviral drug resistance; 3) considerations for when to initiate therapy; 4) adherence to antiretroviral therapy; 5) considerations for therapy among patients with advanced disease; 6) therapy-related adverse events; 7) interruption of therapy; 8) considerations for changing therapy and available therapeutic options; 9) treatment for acute HIV infection; 10) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among adolescents; 11) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among pregnant women; and 12) concerns related to transmission of HIV to others. Antiretroviral regimens are complex, have serious side effects, pose difficulty with adherence, and carry serious potential consequences from the development of viral resistance because of nonadherence to the drug regimen or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents. Patient education and involvement in therapeutic decisions is critical. Treatment should usually be offered to all patients with symptoms ascribed to HIV infection. Recommendations for offering antiretroviral therapy among asymptomatic patients require analysis of real and potential risks and benefits. Treatment should be offered to persons who have <350 CD4+ T cells/mm3 or plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels of >55,000 copies/mL (by b-deoxyribonucleic acid [bDNA] or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] assays). The recommendation to treat asymptomatic patients should be based on the willingness and readiness of the person to begin therapy; the degree of existing immunodeficiency as determined by the CD4+ T cell count; the risk for disease progression as determined by the CD4+ T cell count and level of plasma HIV RNA; the potential benefits and risks of initiating therapy in an asymptomatic person; and the likelihood, after counseling and education, of adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. Treatment goals should be maximal and durable suppression of viral load, restoration and preservation of immunologic function, improvement of quality of life, and reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Results of therapy are evaluated through plasma HIV RNA levels, which are expected to indicate a 1.0 log10 decrease at 2-8 weeks and no detectable virus (<50 copies/mL) at 4-6 months after treatment initiation. Failure of therapy at 4-6 months might be ascribed to nonadherence, inadequate potency of drugs or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents, viral resistance, and other factors that are poorly understood. Patients whose therapy fails in spite of a high level of adherence to the regimen should have their regimen changed; this change should be guided by a thorough drug treatment history and the results of drug-resistance testing. Because of limitations in the available alternative antiretroviral regimens that have documented efficacy, optimal changes in therapy might be difficult to achieve for patients in whom the preferred regimen has failed. These decisions are further confounded by problems with adherence, toxicity, and resistance. For certain patients, participating in a clinical trial with or without access to new drugs or using a regimen that might not achieve complete suppression of viral replication might be preferable. Because concepts regarding HIV management are evolving rapidly, readers should check regularly for additional information and updates at the HIV/AIDS Treatment Information Service website (http://www.hivatis.org)."
1655,0.005,1.0000,"In November 2007, a liver transplant recipient was confirmed to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C (HCV) infection after the organ procurement agency notified our institution that the donor has been HIV and HCV positive. We reviewed medical records and the collected blood sample results for HIV and HCV testing. A 66 year old female with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis underwent liver transplantation. The donor was a male who had sex with men who received multiple blood transfusions during resuscitation. Preoperative testing for HIV and HCV antibodies were negative for both donor and recipient. Ten months later, HIV and HCV were identified with nucleic acid testing in the recipient and in the stored donor sera. This is the first reported case of HIV transmission from solid organ transplantation in 20 years, and the first ever reported case of simultaneously transmitted HIV and HCV. The current case represents a high risk donor with newly-acquired HIV and HCV who transmitted the diseases during the window period of the infections. In this era of organ shortages one option would be avoidance of any high-risk donor organs. Another option would be to continue the use of such organs with appropriate informed consent, acknowledging the limitations of current screening tests for HIV and HCV. This report should serve as a wake-up call to the transplant community to consider revamping organ donor screening for HIV and HCV using nucleic acid testing as well as reconsidering the ongoing use of high-risk donors."
4761,0.005,1.0000,"To describe the epidemiology of infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among injecting drug users (IDUs) in Australia, in relation to the potential for further spread of HIV in IDUs, a cross-sectional analysis was performed on data from a sample of injecting drug users, correlating markers of exposure to blood-borne viruses with sex, age, sexual orientation, primary current drug injected and duration of injecting in rural and metropolitan Victoria, Australia. The subjects were currently active IDUs from a wide spectrum of age, sex, sexual orientation, geographical location and social background, contacted and recruited through their social networks and from community agencies and prisons by trained peer workers who interviewed and collected blood from them in the field. Sera were tested for antibody to HIV, HCV and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and for HCV RNA using reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At entry to the study, 4.5% (14/311) had antibody to HIV, 47% (146/308) to HBcAg and 68% (206/303) to HCV. Prevalence of HBsAg was 1.8% overall (5/282), and 50% (84/168) were positive for HCV RNA. By multivariate analysis, HIV seropositivity was strongly associated with a history of homosexual contact in males and with exposure to HBV but not to HCV. Those who reported their current primary injected drug to be amphetamines were at greater and continuing risk of HIV infection than were current heroin injectors, while the reverse applied for HCV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
12987,0.005,1.0000,"A review of published literature on viral hepatitis infections in Pakistan is presented. A total of 220 abstracts available in the Pakmedinet and Medline have been searched. All relevant articles were reviewed to determine the prevalence of hepatitis viral infections in Pakistan. Two hundred and three (203) relevant articles/abstracts including twenty nine supporting references are included in this review. Of the articles on prevalence of hepatitis infection, seven were related to Hepatitis A, fifteen to Hepatitis E while the remaining articles were on frequency of hepatitis B and C in different disease and healthy population groups. These included eight studies on healthy children, three on vertical transmission, nineteen on pregnant women, fifteen on healthy individuals, six on army recruits, thirty one on blood donors, thirteen on health care workers, five on unsafe injections, seventeen on high risk groups, five on patients with provisional diagnosis of hepatitis, thirty three on patients with chronic liver disease, four on genotypes of HBV and five on genotypes of HCV. This review highlights the lack of community-based epidemiological work as the number of subjects studied were predominantly patients, high risk groups and healthy blood donors. High level of Hepatitis A seroconversion was found in children and this viral infection accounts for almost 50%-60% of all cases of acute viral hepatitis in children in Pakistan. Hepatitis E is endemic in the country affecting mostly the adult population and epidemic situations have been reported from many parts of the country. The mean results of HBsAg and Anti-HCV prevalence on the basis of data aggregated from several studies was calculated which shows 2.3% and 2.5% prevalence of HBsAg and Anti-HCV in children, 2.5% and 5.2% among pregnant women, 2.6% and 5.3% in general population, 3.5% and 3.1% in army recruits, 2.4% and 3.6% in blood donors, 6.0% and 5.4% in health care workers, 13.0% and 10.3% in high risk groups, 12.3% and 12.0% in patients with provisional diagnosis of hepatitis and 25.7% and 54% in patients with chronic liver disease respectively. This review has illustrated the high endemicity of hepatitis viral infections in Pakistan where hepatitis B and C potentially account for a serious burden of the disease. This review has triggered the launching of a network intervention for the control of hepatitis viral infectious. This review was used as the basis for the launch of hepatitis programme, but putting it into a formal review took time and the hepatitis program was initiated."
18446,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been implicated as a trigger for various autoimmune diseases, one of which is dermatomyositis. This is a very rare autoimmune disease characterised by myopathy, typical cutaneous signs and variable systemic manifestations. To our knowledge, the association of this rare disease with HIV infection has not been previously reported in Nigeria. We therefore decided to report the case of a 40 year old HIV-1 infected Nigerian female who presented to us with muscle, skin, and systemic manifestations of dermatomyositis. Our aim is to show the effect of HIV infection, as well as HAART-induced immune reconstitution on the clinical course of dermatomyositis."

The control subjects included men at high risk for exposure to HIV-1 and those at low risk. None of the HIV-positive subjects met criteria for HIV-associated dementia or had detectable opportunistic brain disease. Quantitative image-analytic techniques were used to estimate volumes of ventricular and cortical cerebrospinal fluid, cerebral white matter, and cortical and subcortical gray matter structures. Relative to low-risk group control subjects and asymptomatic HIV-positive subjects, nondemented but medically symptomatic HIV-positive subjects showed significant increases in cerebrospinal fluid, reduced volume of cerebral white matter, and reduced cerebral gray matter volumes. Unexpectedly, however, some cerebrospinal fluid increases and gray matter volume decreases were present in the seronegative high-risk control subjects as well."

In five, HIV positivity on serologic testing was first found when tuberculosis was diagnosed. The mean CD4 cell count was 37.3 +/- 29.6/microliters. Results of tuberculin skin tests were negative in 5 patients. One patient had pulmonary tuberculosis and 5 had miliary tuberculosis. Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy was found on chest X-ray films in 4 patients and superficial lymphadenopathy was found in all patients. All patients had positive mycobacterial cultures of sputum and 2 patients had positive tests for acid-fast bacilli on smears of lymph-node aspirates. In one patient with tuberculosis meningitis, a culture of cerebrospinal fluid for acid-fast bacilli was positive. Epithelioid cell granulomas were found in samples of lung, liver, and bone marrow from 4 patients. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated from all patients, and was not resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, or streptomycin. Therefore all patients responded well to treatment of tuberculosis."
9390,0.005,1.0000,"In a previous cohort study among 327 men who have sex with men (MSM) in Buenos Aires, an HIV incidence rate of 3.9 per 100 persons-year was reported. Using data from this study, we determined: (a) HIV/STI co-infections; (b) clinical manifestations of incident HIV infections; (c) syphilis incidence and its associated risk factors; and (d) adherence and immune response to hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine. During the cohort study, 12 incident HIV infections were found. Within this group, HIV infection alone was most frequent (42%), followed by co-infection of HIV/HBV (33%), and triple co-infection of HIV/HBV/syphilis (25%). The most frequent clinical manifestations among incident HIV cases were: pharyngitis, fever, lymphadenopathy, asthenia, and myalgia. Seven new syphilis infections were detected yielding an incidence rate of 2.4 (95% CI=1.07 - 4.73) per 100 persons-year. Sex work was the only significant risk factor associated with syphilis seroconversion (hazard rate=10.93, p-value=0.033). Only 7% of cohort participants reported having received HBV vaccine. Ninety-percent of the 204 cohort members who agreed to be vaccinated completed the HBV vaccination schedule with an immune response rate of 85%. Our findings suggest the need to increase the access to serologic testing for STI and HBV immunization, as well as the developing of effective HIV/STI behavioral and educational prevention programs among MSM in Buenos Aires."
18516,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 RNA levels are routinely monitored as part of patient management. However, little is known about the course of HIV-1 RNA levels over the entire period of infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the course of HIV-1 RNA levels in a cohort of men with hemophilia who were observed for up to 17 years after HIV-1 seroconversion, and to assess the risk of HIV disease progression at any HIV-1 RNA level. Viral loads were measured on annual stored serum samples in 107 men with hemophilia A using the Roche Amplicor Monitor assay with non-B primers. On average, HIV-1 RNA levels increased significantly by 0.11 log10 per year over the course of HIV infection. This rate of increase was significantly faster in those who developed AIDS or died over the subsequent 12 to 17 year period, and in those who were older at HIV- 1 seroconversion. The risk of developing AIDS and death remained low when the HIV-1 RNA level was below 4 log10 copies/ml, but increased rapidly thereafter, supporting current guidelines for the initiation of antiretroviral therapy after the viral load has exceeded this level."
12801,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) subtype 1b, which infects approximately 70% of Japanese carriers, is likely to be more eradicable by a telaprevir regimen than subtype 1a because of the higher genetic barrier of Val(36) and Arg(155) substitutions. The aims of this exploratory study were to evaluate the virological response and safety of 24-week oral administration of telaprevir alone in chronic HCV subtype 1b infection. Fifteen treatment-naïve patients were treated with telaprevir 750 mg every 8 h for 24 weeks. All patients were Japanese whose median age was 58.0 years (range: 45-68), and six patients (40%) were men. Median baseline HCV RNA level was 6.80 log(10) IU/mL (range: 3.55-7.10). The HCV RNA levels decreased to undetectable in five patients (33%) within 8 weeks. Three patients (20%) with negative HCV RNA by Week 4 achieved end of treatment response. One patient (7%) who achieved sustained virological response had a low baseline viraemia of 3.55 log(10) IU/mL. Most of the adverse events including anaemia and skin disorders were mild to moderate. Developed variants were T54A and A156V/T/F/Y with or without secondary substitutions rather than V36M ± R155K. Telaprevir alone for 24 weeks in Japanese patients with HCV subtype 1b resulted in an sustained viral response rate of 7% (1/15) and was well tolerated for 24 weeks. These results will support the implementation of further studies on oral combination of telaprevir with other direct-acting antiviral agents in patients infected with HCV subtype 1b."
1943,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to examine the association between perceived family support, either positive or negative, and adherence to antiretroviral medication regimens among HIV-positive individuals in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. We measured past 3-month antiretroviral adherence among 233 HIV-positive individuals, in relation to perceived family support, both positive (in terms of emotional and instrumental support) and negative (in the form of negative interactions), using the 10-item Nepali Family Support and Difficulty Scale. Medium and high levels of perceived emotional support from family were associated with reduced risk of antiretroviral nonadherence, compared with low levels of perceived emotional support (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]  = 0.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.16, 0.88], and AOR  = 0.23, 95% CI [0.08, 0.64], respectively). Conversely, higher levels of felt emotional distance (AOR  = 1.46, 95% CI [1.00, 2.14]) and experienced physical harm (AOR  = 2.04, 95% CI [1.07, 3.91]) were associated with increased risk of nonadherence. The results support the recommendation that service providers need to be aware of the significant role of family support in shaping antiretroviral adherence and to consider ways to strengthen positive family support while minimizing negative family interactions to increase adherence rates.

When compared with normative data on healthy U.S. children, parent reports for the HIV-infected children did not differ significantly on the following CHQ concepts: role/social related to emotional, behavioral or physical problems; bodily pain; behavior; mental health; self-esteem; impact on parental time; family activities; and family cohesion. Parents perceived their children to be functioning at a level significantly lower than the norm in general health (t -6.47, p = .000), physical functioning (t -2.37, p = .024), and physical summary (t -3.80, p = .001). Parental impact-emotional was impressively higher than the norm (t -3.74, p = .001). Differences were independent of gender, primary language, ethnicity, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clinical classifications for pediatric HIV disease."
1728,0.005,1.0000,"To explore whether HIV stigma negatively impacts adherence to antiviral medications in HIV-infected adolescent women, moderational analysis was conducted and factors identified that could alter said relationship. Study participants were 178 adolescent females age 15-24, enrolled between 2003-2005, from 5 different cities and 60 provided adherence information. Findings reported by this cohort of 60 adolescent women included: medication adherence, 64.3% reporting adherence at baseline and 45.0% at 12 months; HIV stigma score of 57.60 (standard deviation [SD], 11.83; range, 25-86). HIV stigma was not found to be a significant predictor when binary logit regression was run with medication adherence at 1 year. Using moderational analysis, factors that could moderate stigma's effect on medication adherence was still pursued and identified the following to be significant at 12 months: health care satisfaction (B = -0.020, standard error [SE] = 0.010, p < .05); and Coping (proactive coping strategies [B = 0.012, SE = 0.005, p < .05]; turning to family [B = 0.012, SE = 0.016, p < 0.05]; spiritual coping [B = 0.021, SE = 0.010, p < 0.05]; professional help [B = 0.021, SE = 0.010, p < 0.05]; physical diversions [B = 0.016, SE = 0.007, p < 0.05]). Factors that had no significant moderating effects included: social support measures (mean = 74.9; median = 74.0) and depression score greater than 16 = 43%. We conclude that HIV-infected adolescent women experience HIV stigma and poor adherence over time. Factors like health care satisfaction and coping may minimize stigma's effect on medication adherence. Our findings are tempered by a small sample size and lack of a direct relationship between stigma and adherence on binary logit regression analysis."
5866,0.005,1.0000,"This study assesses changes in quality of life (QoL) over time among HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) and evaluates how this relates to ARTadherence. Prospective, longitudinal data were examined from 1050 participants in two large, randomized, multi-centre antiretroviral clinical trials. QoL was assessed by the SF-12; adherence by the Terry Beirn Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS Antiretroviral Medication Self-report. Participants included 20% women, 53% African Americans, 16% Latinos; mean age was 39 years; mean baseline CD4+ cell count 230 cells/mm3; 89% were ART-naïve at entry. Baseline physical and mental health summary QoL scores were 45.4 and 42.9, comparable to scores reported in other advanced HIV populations. Significant improvements in mean QoL scores were seen for the group as a whole after 1 to 4 months on new ART regimens, and persisted for 12 months. Participants reporting 100% ART adherence achieved significantly higher QoL scores at 12 months compared to those with poorer adherence, particularly if 100% adherence was consistent (p < 0.001). Those with at least 80% ART adherence had smaller gains in QoL at 12 months when compared to baseline, while those with < 80% adherence had worsening of QoL. In this analysis, ART adherence was associated with improved QoL, particularly if adherence was sustained."
471,0.005,1.0000,"Depression is common among people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, little is known about how depression influences physical health and socioeconomic well-being in the context of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Semistructured interviews with 40 adult HIV clients receiving ART in Uganda were conducted to assess experiences prior to and after HIV diagnosis and initiation of ART. Content analysis revealed themes that were suggestive of the following patterns: (1) functioning decreased after patients were diagnosed with HIV, but improved following ART, (2) depression is associated with lower physical health functioning and work status levels after both HIV diagnosis and ART, and (3) antidepressant medication is associated with better functioning compared with patients with depression not receiving depression treatment. These findings suggest that depression plays a role in the deleterious effects of HIV on functioning, and that antidepressant treatment provided alongside ART may serve to help individuals regain functioning, particularly employment. These findings highlight the potential value of integrating depression treatment into HIV care. "
16896,0.005,1.0000,"The chronically HIV-infected cellular reservoir in lymphoid tissue (LT) represents a formidable obstacle to the long-term success of antiretroviral therapy. Cytoreductive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (CTX) reduces cells in LT, and we hypothesized that coadministration of antiretroviral therapy with CTX may diminish the cellular reservoir over time. Ten antiretroviral treatment-naive subjects were recruited, and they received stavudine, lamivudine and nelfinavir (antiretroviral therapy, ART) until 2 consecutive plasma HIV RNA levels measured < 50 copies/ml (step 1). Five subjects then received ART alone, whereas five subjects received ART plus three escalating doses of CTX (step 2). Viral DNA was measured in LT obtained by excisional lymph node biopsy and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), using quantitative polymerase chain reaction at three time points in both groups (before steps 1 and 2, and after CTX). Viral DNA declined in both groups after the initiation of ART alone in step 1. During step 2 both groups experienced a modest decline compared with step 1. However, no significant differences were observed in viral DNA in LT or PBMCs between the ART alone and the ART plus CTX groups. Suppression of plasma HIV RNA levels < 50 copies/ml was not maintained in the ART plus CTX group, perhaps because of inadequate medication adherence. The group receiving ART plus CTX had lower CD4(+) lymphocyte counts and absolute total lymphocytes compared with the ART alone group. We conclude that the addition of CTX to ART did not diminish the cellular reservoir in HIV-infected persons."
553,0.005,1.0000,"Obesity, sedentary lifestyles, and antiretroviral therapies may predispose HIV-infected children to poor physical fitness. Estimated peak oxygen consumption (VO(2) peak), maximal strength and endurance, and flexibility were measured in HIV-infected and uninfected children. Among HIV-infected children, anthropometric and HIV disease-specific factors were evaluated to determine their association with VO(2) peak. Forty-five HIV-infected children (mean age 16.1 years) and 36 uninfected children (mean age 13.5 years) participated in the study. In HIV-infected subjects, median viral load was 980 copies/ml (IQR 200-11,000 copies/ml), CD4% was 28% (IQR 15-35%), and 82% were on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Compared to uninfected children, after adjusting for age, sex, race, body fat, and siblingship, HIV-infected children had lower VO(2) peak (25.92 vs. 30.90 ml/kg/min, p<0.0001), flexibility (23.71% vs. 46.09%, p=0.0003), and lower-extremity strength-to-weight ratio (0.79 vs. 1.10 kg lifted/kg of body weight, p=0.002). Among the HIV-infected children, a multivariable analysis adjusting for age, sex, race, percent body fat, and viral load showed VO(2) peak was 0.30 ml/kg/min lower per unit increase in percent body fat (p<0.0001) and VO(2) peak (SE) decreased 29.45 (± 1 .62), 28.70 (± 1.87), and 24.09 (± 0.75) ml/kg/min across HAART exposure categories of no exposure, <60, and ≥ 60 months, respectively (p<0.0001). HIV-infected children had, in general, lower measures of fitness compared to uninfected children. Factors negatively associated with VO(2) peak in HIV-infected children include higher body fat and duration of HAART ≥ 60 months. Future studies that elucidate the understanding of these differences and mechanisms of decreased physical fitness should be pursued."
99,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence, the act of following a course of medication in exactly the manner prescribed, is critical for the success of therapy. Adherence is influenced by many behavioural and social factors and incarceration might be one such factor. This study determined the level of adherence and reasons for non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy among 93 HIV-infected prisoners. Up to 56% of these patients had poor adherence. A similar rate of adherence was detected in prisoners after release. Problems with antiretroviral adherence among prisoners appear to be mostly linked to their deviant behaviour. Inmates with poor adherence had higher HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Age and country of origin were also associated with adherence."
12675,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV are common coinfections that convey a shortened lifespan, mostly related to liver disease. Treatment against HCV in the coinfected patient is notoriously more complex and challenging. There are no optimal treatment algorithms for HIV/HCV coinfected patients as efficacy of approved anti-HCV therapies is low with relevant side effects. The use of direct-acting antivirals for anti-HCV therapy has the potential to improve therapeutic efficacy, but also increase side effects and drug-drug interactions. In spite of all of this, the most important and significant fact is that chronic hepatitis C is potentially curable, and the eradication of the HCV infection is a crucial outcome in this population. The establishment of a productive collaboration among the regulatory agencies, the medical community and the pharmaceutical industry could lead to faster access to more effective HCV therapies for the coinfected patient and eventually stop the progression of liver disease in these patients."
14062,0.005,1.0000,"The efficacy of current hepatitis C therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients is largely dependent on HCV genotype. The annual prevalence of HCV genotypes/subtypes and their influence on HCV clearance with antiviral treatment were examined in a dynamic cohort of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients followed up in Madrid since 2000. Patients entered the cohort at first visit and left the cohort when HCV clearance was achieved with HCV therapy or when follow-up was interrupted for any reason, including death. A total of 672 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients constituted the cohort. The mean follow-up time was 5.5 years, corresponding to 4108 patient-years. Mean age at entry was 37 years, and 73% were men and 86% were intravenous drug users. Overall distribution of HCV genotypes was as follows: 57.1% HCV-1 (1a: 29.2%, 1b: 20.4%, unknown: 7.6%), 1.3% HCV-2, 25.4% HCV-3 and 15.9% HCV-4. A total of 274 (40.8%) patients were treated with peginterferon-ribavirin, of whom 116 (42.3%) achieved HCV clearance following 1-3 courses of therapy. The proportion of HCV-1/4 rose from 71.7% in 2000 to 76.8% in 2008, whereas the proportion of HCV-2/3 fell from 28.1% in 2000 to 23.2% in 2008. The yearly prevalence increased for HCV-1 (R(2) : 0.92, b: 0.59, P < 0.001) and HCV-4 (R(2) : 0.77, b: 0.33, P < 0.005) and conversely diminished for HCV-3 (R(2) : 0.94, b: -0.82, P < 0.001). In summary, the prevalence of HCV-1 and HCV-4 has increased over the last decade in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, whereas conversely it has declined for HCV-3, in association with the wider use of HCV therapy (41%) in this population."
10780,0.005,1.0000,"The occurrence of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has rarely been reported in the literature. In this report, we describe the experience of a single centre in the management of 10 such patients, including demographic information, disease characteristics and response to therapy. We had a black female predominance in our series, with only a minority of patients achieving a complete cytogenetic response. The main reason for this appears to be compliance, which was influenced by distance to the treating centre. The side-effect profile was similar to that expected, with the exception of one patient who developed a drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Although CML patients co-morbid for HIV face certain unique challenges when compared to non-infected patients, their long-term outcome can be positive when appropriately managed."
14818,0.005,1.0000,"The status of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection at the time of transmission to sexual contacts remains poorly defined. Transmission to nonsexual household contacts has appeared to be rare. A total of 505 sexual and nonsexual contacts of HIV-1-infected hemophiliacs in 349 households was observed. At entry, 10% of 201 sexual partners were anti-HIV-1-positive. Follow-up of 151 uninfected partners during a total of 351 person-years of observation showed no sero-conversions, although there were 13 pregnancies during that period. Eighty-seven percent of the seronegative respondents to a detailed questionnaire reported unprotected sexual contact at least occasionally. Among 304 other household members, including 108 parents who helped administer clotting factor concentrates to their children, none was seropositive at entry. Follow-up of 263 showed no seroconversions during a total of 605 person-years of observation. Thus, anti-HIV-1-positive hemophiliacs transmitted to their partners earlier in their course but were not found to do so when prospectively observed. No relationship to level of viremia as indicated by CD4 count, HIV-1 p24 antigenemia, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was found. Anti-HIV-1-positive hemophiliacs had not transmitted to their nonsexual household contacts before study entry and did not do so subsequently, indicating that the risk from even close nonsexual contact is extremely low."

Volunteers older than 18 years old without a previous HIV-positive diagnosis were included. HIV-positive samples were analyzed by the Serological Testing Algorithm for Recent HIV Seroconversion (STARHS) to estimate incidence. By partial RT-PCR and sequencing of the HIV pol gene, an HIV subtype and resistance profile were determined. A total of 12,192 volunteers were recruited from October 2006 to September 2008. A higher HIV prevalence was detected among trans SWs (33.9%, 38/112), male SWs (10.8%, 12/111), and MSM 10.4% (161/1549). HIV incidence estimates by STARHS was also higher on trans SWs (11.31 per 100 person-years), male SWs (6.06 per 100 person-years), and MSM (6.36 per 100 person-years). Antiretroviral primary resistant mutations were detected in 8.4% of the study group, with a higher frequency in female DUs (33.3%). Phylogenetic analysis showed that 124 (57.9%) samples were subtype B, 84 (39.3%) intersubtype BF recombinants, 5 (2.3%) subtype C, and 1 (0.5%) subtype F in the pol region. Subtype B was most commonly found in MSM and male SWs whereas the intersubtype BF recombinant was more prevalent in female DUs, female SWs, and PW. Given the high HIV prevalence and incidence found in most of these groups, monitoring the continuing spread of the HIV epidemic is essential for determining public health priorities, assessing the impact of interventions, and estimating current and future health care needs."
10873,0.005,1.0000,"Up to December 2002, a total of 56, 566 and 109 cases of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-I), HTLV-II and human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) infection, respectively, were identified in Spain. Most HTLV-I- and HIV-2-infected subjects were immigrants from endemic areas or Spaniards who had traveled to, or had sexual contacts with natives from, these areas. In contrast, HTLV-II infection was mainly limited to Spanish intravenous drug users (IDU) who were frequently coinfected with HIV-1. Among HTLV-I-infected patients, 12 developed subacute myelopathy and 4 adult T-cell leukemia. As for the HIV-2-positive subjects, only 20 (18.3%) developed AIDS. There was no evidence of an increase in the incidence of HIV-2 and HTLV-I infections over time. In contrast, HTLV-II infection has spread in recent years among the HIV-1-positive IDU population in prisons, with a rate of 18% in some regions of Spain. Nevertheless, the prevalence of HTLV-II infection in HIV-1-positive IDU outpatients is still low (4.7%)."
539,0.005,1.0000,"Liver transplantation (LT) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals is considered to be an experimental therapy with limited reported worldwide experience, and little long-term survival data. Published data suggest that the short-term outcome is encouraging in selected patients. Here, we report our experience in 14 HIV-infected liver allograft recipients, and compare outcomes between those coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the non-HCV group. A total of 14 HIV-infected patients (12 male, 2 female, age range 26-59 years) underwent LT between January 1995 and April 2003. Indications for LT were HCV (n = 7), hepatitis B virus (HBV; n = 4), alcohol-induced liver disease (n = 2), and seronegative hepatitis (n = 1); 3 patients presented with acute liver failure. At LT, CD4 cell counts (T-helper cells that are targets for HIV) ranged from 124 to 500 cells/microL (mean 264), and HIV viral loads from <50 to 197,000 copies/mL. Nine of 12 patients were exposed to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) before LT. In the non-HCV group (n = 7), all patients are alive, all surviving more than 365 days (range 668-2,661 days). No patient has experienced HBV recurrence, and graft function is normal in all 7 patients. However, 5 of 7 HCV-infected patients died after LT at 95-784 days (median 161 days). A total of 4 patients died of complications due to recurrent HCV infection and sepsis, despite antiviral therapy in 3 of them. A total of 3 patients experienced complications relating to HAART therapy. In conclusion, outcome of LT in HIV-infected patients with HBV or other causes of chronic liver disease indicates that LT is an acceptable therapeutic option in selected patients. However, longer follow-up in larger series is required before a conclusive directive can be provided for HCV / HIV coinfected patients requiring LT."
13579,0.005,1.0000,"High rates of coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) and the hepatitis B virus (HBV) are commonly found in at risk populations due to their shared parenteral route of transmission. Although the increasingly widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has prolonged survival for those with HIV, it has also increased the potential for morbidity and mortality from other diseases and opportunistic infections. Liver-related illness is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in those infected with HIV and HBV is responsible for a vast proportion of this, especially in regions of high HBV prevalence. HIV/HBV coinfected patients may exhibit atypical serological markers of HBV infection, hindering appropriate diagnosis. They may experience faster progression to cirrhosis, decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma than HBV-monoinfected patients. Rates of response to vaccine against HBV are abrogated in those with HIV, facilitating the spread of the virus. Treatment of HBV must be monitored for resistance, although newer agents appear to have less risk of resistance development. Moreover, treatment of HIV with antivirals must be monitored closely for liver toxicity. Because liver damage with HBV occurs via the immune response to the virus, liver damage is possible with HAART-mediated immune reconstitution. Although liver transplant is not commonly undertaken in HIV-positive patients, centers undertaking transplantation report improved survival and low rates of HBV recurrence."

The IF technique used acetone-fixed HIV-1-infected E cells and uninfected HUT-78 cells mixed at a 1:3 ratio in one spot on a glass slide and uninfected HUT-78 cells (to assess nonspecific fluorescence) alone in a second spot. Of 114 serum specimens, 85 were repeat EIA positive, and 21 of these were WB positive. A total of 129 of 134 of the IF results (included were 20 duplicates) were identical between laboratories, for a Kappa agreement statistic of 0.93. All five IF results discordant between laboratories were EIA repeat positive and WB negative. Included in the study were eight WB-indeterminate sera, of which five blood donor serum specimens and one hemophiliac serum specimen were IF negative and two acquired immune deficiency syndrome serum specimens were IF positive. As a confirmatory test for HIV-1 antibodies, IF provided a faster alternative or supplementary test for confirming EIA results."
7551,0.005,1.0000,"We report two cases of severe hypertriglyceridaemia associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The first patient, a 39-year-old man, developed moderate hypertriglyceridaemia (5.88 mmol/L) and hypercholesterolaemia (7.0 mmol/L) after 8 months of HAART. When his therapy was altered, triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations increased further to 15.9 and 10.9 mmol/L, respectively, after 6 weeks. The second patient, a 31-year-old man, presented with triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations of 16.2 and 5.7 mmol/L, respectively, following an 8-year history of HAART. Therapy was changed, but 1 month later the triglyceride concentration had increased to 39.4 mmol/L and the cholesterol concentration to 12.1 mmol/L. Both patients were managed by a change in HAART and the introduction of a fibric acid derivative. Although neither patient displayed any clinical symptoms associated with hypertriglyceridaemia, it is important to recognize such cases because of the associated risk of pancreatitis and coronary disease."
19784,0.005,1.0000,"The aims of the present study were to assess initial virological response (IVR) to adefovir (ADV) treatment for chronic hepatitis B, to identify patients with suboptimal response and to determine the incidence of ADV-resistant mutants. All patients treated with ADV for at least 12 months were evaluated for virological response and ADV resistance. IVR was defined as a reduction > or = 4 log10 IU/mL in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA at month 6. Forty-two patients were analysed. Mean treatment duration was 23 +/- 7 months; 50% had prior lamivudine (LAM) therapy (LAM resistance 62%); 88% were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative; and 76% carried genotype D. IVR was seen in 40.5% of patients. Higher baseline ALT level was the only factor associated with IVR (P = 0.043). Patients with IVR achieved undetectable HBV-DNA at month 12 in 77% of cases compared with only 5% of those without IVR (P < 0.001). Five (12%) patients developed ADV-resistant mutations: rtN236T in four cases and one case with an rtV207L change, which has not been previously reported. This mutation was accompanied by viral rebound and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flare. The cumulative probability of ADV-resistant mutations at 12 and 24 months was 5% and 17% respectively. IVR defined as a reduction > or = 4 log10 IU/mL in HBV-DNA at month 6 is a useful tool to predict virological response at month 12 and to identify patients with suboptimal response to ADV. Cumulative probability of ADV resistance is higher than previously reported for nucleos(t)ide-naïve patients."
8047,0.005,1.0000,"To meet the needs of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals, innovative approaches to health care delivery have been developed that could affect the entire worldwide medical care system. Innovations include dedicated inpatient and outpatient AIDS treatment and research units, extensive community service organizations, active volunteers, hospices, visiting nurses, AIDS information hot lines, confidential testing sites, outpatient infusion centers, integration of research and clinical care, and new roles for health professionals including AIDS as an unofficial medical subspecialty. Patient care has replaced medical care, and nurture and technology must coexist when a cure cannot be assured. Physicians expecting choice in patients they care for must accept HIV; staggering health care costs, a sorely taxed public care system, fear of infection or medical inadequacy, declining nursing school enrollment, decreased interest in primary care medical specialties, a dwindling supply of community volunteers, and sparse extended care facilities hamper our efforts to provide for AIDS patients. However, the abundance of vacant hospital beds, the social and scientific challenge of AIDS care and research, employment opportunities, and a new generation of health care professionals accepting AIDS as part of the challenge of medicine all offer hope for change. In AIDS, we have the opportunity to strike an alliance between the art of healing and the advanced technology of modern medicine. In doing so, we will all face our own mortality."
11397,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence and incidence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction was examined in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Sixty-nine randomly selected patients diagnosed with HIV infection who were followed in HIV clinics were prospectively evaluated by 2-dimensional echocardiography. Mean follow-up duration was 11 months. Additionally, 39 consecutive HIV-infected patients referred to the Cardiomyopathy Service and found to have LV dysfunction by 2-dimensional echocardiography were also studied. Of the 39 referred patients, 34 (87%) were referred for recent onset, unexplained, congestive heart failure. During this time, the HIV clinic population comprised 1,819 alive and actively followed patients; the 39 cardiomyopathy referrals therefore constituted a crude rate of 2.1% for this population. Of the 69 prospectively studied patients without clinical heart disease, a 14.5% prevalence of global LV hypokinesia and an incidence of 18%/patient-year were found. During a maximal 18-month follow-up period, 4 prospective patients (5.8%) developed symptoms of congestive heart failure. A greater proportion of prospective and referred patients with LV dysfunction had CD4 counts < 100/mm3 (62 and 79%, respectively) than did that of those without LV dysfunction (35%). In conclusion, the high rate of unexpected LV dysfunction in this HIV-infected population suggests that early cardiac contractile abnormalities may involve a significant number of patients, most of whom have low CD4 counts. A subgroup of these patients appears to progress to symptomatic congestive heart failure."
1041,0.005,1.0000,"We present herein a case report of a 59-year-old patient with HIV-1 infection who developed a CMV-induced pseudotumor of the duodenum. The patient presented with oral pain and dysphagia. Physical examination revealed oral thrush. An EIA and a Western blot assay for antibodies to HIV were positive. His CD4-positive lymphocyte count was initially 49/microL with an HIV viral load of 2.6 x 10(5) copies/mL. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation was detected with the CMV antigenemia assay. He had CMV retinitis in both eyes with unilateral blurring. An endoscopic study revealed candida esophagitis, and a tumor-like lesion with an irregular ulcer at the papilla of Vater. Histological and immunohistochemical studies revealed a CMV-induced pseudotumor and severely inflamed duodenal mucosa with infiltration of CMV-positive cells. The patient was treated with oral valganciclovir and fluconazole for three weeks. As the oral thrush and retinitis showed improvement, he began antiretroviral therapy (ART), consisting of raltegravir and TDF/ FTC. One month later the patient's CD4-positive cells increased to 130/microL and the level of HIV-RNA decreased to 160 copies/mL, The CMV retinitis had transiently worsened because of an ART-induced inflammatory response, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Six months after the ART initiation, an endoscopic study revealed that the esophagitis and the lesion at the papilla had improved. Biopsy showed no CMV-positive cells in the epithelium. The patient was now in a relatively healthy condition. CMV-induced pseudotumors of the duodenum are rare, and sometimes resemble malignancy. However, because this tomor responds to medical treatment physicians treating severely immunocompromised patients should be aware of its presentation and treatment."
17901,0.005,1.0000,"We investigated risk factors for unfavorable virologic responses among HIV-infected patients who recently switched antiretroviral regimens. We identified HIV-infected patients who switched antiretroviral regimens (defined as adding ≥2 new medications) between 2001 and 2008 at Kaiser Permanente California. Virological response, measured after 6 months on the new regimen, was classified as (1) maximal viral suppression (HIV RNA <75/ml), (2) low-level viremia (LLV; 75-5000/ml), or (3) advanced virologic failure (>5000/ml). Potential risk factors examined included (1) HIV disease factors, e.g., prior AIDS, CD4 cell count; (2) history of antiretroviral use, e.g., therapy classes of the newly switched regimen, medication adherence, and virologic failure at previous regimens; and (3) novel patient-level factors including comorbidities and healthcare utilization. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for LLV and advanced virologic failure were obtained from multivariable nominal logistic regression models. A total of 3447 patients were included; 2608 (76%) achieved maximal viral suppression, 420 (12%) had LLV, and 419 (12%) developed advanced virologic failure. Factors positively associated with LLV and advanced virologic failure included number of regimens prior to switch [aOR(per regimen)=1.38 (1.17-1.62) and 1.77 (1.50-2.08), respectively], nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor-only regimens (vs. protease inhibitor-based) [aOR=2.78 (1.28-6.04) and 5.10 (2.38-10.90), respectively], and virologic failure at previous regimens [aOR=3.15 (2.17-4.57) and 4.71 (2.84-7.81), respectively]. Older age, higher CD4 cell count, and medication adherence were protective for unfavorable virologic outcomes. Antiretroviral regimen-level factors and immunodeficiency were significantly associated with virologic failure after a recent therapy switch and should be considered when making treatment change decisions."
13931,0.005,1.0000,"We report a first case of HIV-associated lymphoma (HAL) presenting with acute kidney injury (AKI) and inflammatory immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS). A 39-year-old male, treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for one month prior to admission, developed AKI, left testicular tumor, and recurrent swelling of the right parotid gland. A resected testicular tumor exhibited features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma. Renal biopsy showed hydro-degeneration of renal tubules, interstitial inflammatory cells, and a small number of lymphoma cells in the sub-capsule, compatible with acute interstitial nephritis. His renal dysfunction rapidly recovered following chemotherapy and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). He developed pneumonia concomitantly with a decrease in HIV-RNA level and an increase in CD4+ cells after the first cycle of chemotherapy, which spontaneously resolved after the second cycle of chemotherapy without additional anti-infection drugs; thus, his pneumonia fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for IRIS. We suggest that IRIS may frequently develop during chemotherapy for HAL, but may be overlooked. He was coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), which genotypes known as is associated with liver-related mortality and response to antiviral therapy; recently, an intimate interplay between HIV and HBV in the onset of lymphoma has been reported. Therefore, we addressed the HBV genotype in the patient. The analysis revealed that he exhibited a mixed genotype (A/E) not native to Japan and primarily found in Europe and North America or West Africa. These findings suggest that universal vaccination for juveniles against HBV is warranted in Japan."
13971,0.005,1.0000,"Mouse monoclonal antibodies with high human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) neutralizing titers were used for passive immunotherapy of eleven late-state HIV-infected patients. In five patients the serum level of the core protein p24 decreased, while in five cases it remained unchanged. The level of viral RNA in plasma as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) decreased in four cases, was stable in another four, and increased in three cases. An anti-mouse (HAMA) response developed in eight patients and anti-idiotypic antibodies appeared in six. Immune complexes that formed in patient sera during the treatment were shown to contain mostly envelope glycoprotein gp120 which decreased in nine of the eleven treated patients toward the end of treatment. Antibodies inhibiting gp120 binding to CD4 became detectable or increased in six patients during immunotherapy. Serology of the HIV-1 V3 region was studied for both the HIV-1 IIIB and MN strains with no or very small changes in titer or avidity after treatment. No change in neutralizing titers to strain HTLVIIIB was observed in serum samples collected before and after treatment was terminated. In nine of the eleven patients stimulation of the T lymphocytes to proliferate in vitro when activated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was shown to be increased compared to before treatment. Increased T-cell proliferation was also noted with several antigens such as HIV-1 recombinant antigens, cytomegalovirus (CMV), tetanus toxoid (TT), and purified protein derivate of mycobacterium tuberculosis (PPD). These findings indicate a decreased total gp120 content in serum, permitting better T-cell activation."

Two neighbour captive animal served as controls. The inoculum was the serum of a leukemic patient in remission for over 3 years with NANB chronic active hepatitis which serum contained HBV like particles and was found positive for NANBe Ag and anti-NANBc whereas in the liver typical numerous ""SHIMIZU"" dense soft edge aggregated intranuclear structures were demonstrated by electron microscopy. After 4 weeks portal inflammation and hepatocyte necrosis with significant aminotransferase elevation lasting for over 10 weeks developed in the 2 infected chimpanzees. No change in anti-HBs titer was seen and HBs, HBc, HBe Ag and/or AB could neither be detected in serum by RIA nor in liver by immunofluorescence during the 6 month follow up period. By contrast NANBc Ag became clearly demonstrable by immunofluorescence in the liver nuclei together with anti-NANBc in the serum after the 6th week and both persisted for over 4 months. Double unit structures similar to those of NANB/F strain were demonstrable in the cytoplasm at the acute phase. None of these changes was seen in the two control animals. Inoculation of the acute phase serum in the 2 previous control animals was again followed by the same sequence of events. Hybridization studies with HBV DNA of liver biopsies of infected chimps were negative."

However, HLA class II molecules restrict the nature of CD4 T cell response, and HLA distributions differ between ethnic groups. In this study, we asked whether HLA class II genotypes associated with HCV clearance are shared between Caucasian and African Americans and whether they contribute to enhanced antiviral CD4 T cell response. In a cohort of 93 HCV-seropositive subjects from Northeast America with defined ethnicity, virological outcome, and HCV-specific CD4 T cell proliferation, we confirm the previously reported associations between HCV clearance and two HLA types (DQB1*03, DRB1*11) while identifying a new association with DRB3*02. Strikingly, these associations were identified only among Caucasian [DQB1*03: odds ratio (OR), 10.4; P = 0.031, DRB1*11: OR, 7.0, P = 0.019; DRB3*02: OR, 8.3, P = 0.005; DQB1*03-DRB3*02: OR, 13.5, P = 0.001) but not among African American patients. Furthermore, although HLA DQB1*03, DRB1*11, and DRB3*02 genotypes were associated with increased HCV-specific CD4 T cell response in univariate analyses, these associations were lost when controlling for virological outcomes."

These responses are governed by the host's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type, and HLA-restricted viral escape mutants are a critical aspect of this host-virus interaction. We examined the driving forces of HCV evolution by characterizing the in vivo selective pressure(s) exerted on single amino acid residues within nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) by the HLA types present in two host populations. Associations between polymorphisms within NS3 and HLA class I alleles were assessed in 118 individuals from Western Australia and Switzerland with chronic hepatitis C infection, of whom 82 (69%) were coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus. The levels and locations of amino acid polymorphisms exhibited within NS3 were remarkably similar between the two cohorts and revealed regions under functional constraint and selective pressures. We identified specific HCV mutations within and flanking published epitopes with the correct HLA restriction and predicted escaped amino acid. Additional HLA-restricted mutations were identified that mark putative epitopes targeted by cell-mediated immune responses. This analysis of host-virus interaction reveals evidence of HCV adaptation to HLA class I-restricted immune pressure and identifies in vivo targets of cellular immune responses at the population level."
14159,0.005,1.0000,"Epidemiological, viral and host factors are associated with the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and strong host immune responses against HCV favour viral clearance. Recently, genome-wide association studies have shown a strong correlation between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the interleukin-28B (IL28B) gene and spontaneous or treatment-induced HCV clearance. We have investigated whether protective IL28B genetic variants are associated with HCV-specific T-cell responses among Spanish blood donors. The rs12979860 IL28B haplotype was determined in 69 anti-HCV-positive blood donors (21 HCV RNA negative and 48 HCV RNA positive) and 30 seronegative donors. In all cases, HCV-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses to HCV recombinant proteins (core, NS3 and NS3 helicase) were assessed by ex vivo interferon-γ ELISpot assay. The rs12979860-CC genotype was highly overrepresented in donors with spontaneous HCV clearance when compared to those with chronic infection (76.2%vs 29.2%, P < 0.001; odds ratio, 7.77; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-25.3, P < 0.001). HCV-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses were detected in 16 (76.2%) spontaneous resolvers especially towards nonstructural proteins, but with no correlation with IL28B genotype. Chronic individuals had a significantly lower overall T-cell response again irrespective of IL28B genotype. When spontaneous resolvers and chronic individuals were stratified according to their IL28B genotype, significantly stronger T-cell responses were only observed among those with non-CC haplotypes. Although the protective rs12979860 IL28B CC genotype is associated with spontaneous HCV clearance, stronger CD4(+) T-cell responses towards NS3 were only evident among those with non-CC haplotypes."
17723,0.005,1.0000,"Twenty-five per cent of individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are able to clear HCV spontaneously. Differences in host genetics are believed to affect the outcome of HCV infection. We analysed an exonic, a promoter and an intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the interferon-λ3 coding interleukin (IL)-28B gene to study the relationship between IL28B SNPs and outcome of HCV infection. Among 206 HIV-1-infected Europeans with evidence of HCV infection, 47 (23%) individuals had cleared HCV and 159 (77%) had developed chronic infection. The exonic rs8103142 CT, the promoter rs12979860 CT and the intronic rs11881222 AG genotypes were associated with a decreased HCV clearance rate with adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of 0.3 (95% CI, 0.1-0.7), 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.8) and 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.8), respectively. The haplotype block TCG CTA was associated with a decreased HCV clearance rate (aOR 0.4, 95% CI, 0.2-0.8). Further, we found significant differences in HCV RNA levels among individuals chronically infected with HCV genotype 1 for rs8103142 and rs12979860 (P ≤ 0.05). Chronically infected individuals with HCV genotype 3 and with the favourable haplotype block CTA CTA had higher median HCV RNA levels than individuals with unfavourable haplotype blocks (P ≤ 0.05). Our findings suggest that IL28B may account for some differences in HCV outcome but that other factors including the viral genotype, host genetics and the host-virus interaction are likely to influence the outcome of HCV infection."

However, the sustainability of these HIV-specific immune responses and their impact on clinical outcome remains unclear. We present a 3-year longitudinal clinical and immunological follow-up of a single-arm, prospective study assessing the long-term impact of a short-course of ART (SCART) during PHI. Twenty-eight subjects with defined PHI received 3 months of SCART at HIV-1 seroconversion. HIV-specific interferon-gamma+ CD4+ T cell responses, CD4 cell counts and plasma viral loads were assessed prospectively. Clinical outcome was defined as the time taken from PHI to a fall in CD4 cell counts <350 cells/mul on two or more occasions. Of 28 patients, 25 (89%) had detectable HIV-specific CD4+ helper responses at baseline. Five of 11 (45%) patients had preserved HIV-specific CD4+ responses 3 years after stopping SCART. Neither the presence nor magnitude of HIV-1-specific T helper responses either at baseline or 3 years following SCART cessation predicted clinical outcome. Rebound viraemia associated with stopping SCART did not diminish HIV-1-specific CD4+ responses. Long-term (>3 years) preservation of virus-specific CD4+ cells occurred in 45% of patients receiving SCART in PHI. There was no correlation between either the presence or magnitude of these responses and clinical outcome."
2554,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major and rising global health problem, affecting about 170 million people worldwide. The current standard of care treatment with interferon alpha and ribavirin in patients with the genotype 1 infection, the most frequent genotype in the USA and Western Europe, leads to a successful outcome in only about 50% of individuals. Accurate prediction of hepatitis C treatment response is of great benefit to patients and clinicians. The informational spectrum method, a virtual spectroscopy method for structure/function analysis of nucleotide and protein sequences, is applied here for the identification of the conserved information of the HCV proteins that correlate with the combination therapy outcome. Among the HCV proteins that we have analyzed the informational property of the p7 of HCV genotype 1b was best related to the therapy outcome. On the basis of these results, a simple bioinformatics criterion that could be useful in assessment of the response of HCV-infected patients to the combination therapy has been proposed."

PD-1 expression on HCV-specific T cells was high early in acute infection irrespective of clinical outcome, and most cells continued to express PD-1 in resolved and chronic stages of infection; intrahepatic expression levels were especially high. Our results suggest that an analysis of PD-1 expression alone is not sufficient to predict infection outcome or to determine T-cell functionality in HCV infection."
14247,0.005,1.0000,"Several studies have reported a higher prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) than in the general population. Treatment for NHL includes the use of chemotherapeutic agents such as cytotoxic drugs, corticosteroids, and rituximab, which can be immunosuppressive and hepatotoxic. While reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) when undergoing immunosuppressive therapy for haematological malignancies is a well-documented complication, data on HCV reactivation or liver function impairment after chemotherapy for NHL are controversial. From January 2006 to December 2009, 207 consecutive NHL patients treated with chemotherapy without rituximab (CHOP) or with rituximab (R-CHOP) were observed; screening for HCV infection and baseline liver function tests were performed in all patients. The prevalence of HCV infection was 9.2%. This prevalence is higher than that observed in the general population in Italy (3%). Among the HCV-infected subjects, the incidence of hepatitis flares was 26.3% vs 2.1% among the HCV-uninfected individuals. Although less frequent and less severe than in HBV-infected subjects, liver dysfunction can occur as a consequence of rituximab-containing regimens in HCV-infected patients with NHL. In the cases considered in this study, no patient treated with chemotherapy without rituximab developed hepatitis flares. The frequency and the severity of this complication vary in different reports. Therefore, we recommend the assessment of liver function and the screening of all patients with NHL for HCV infection before starting chemotherapy; we also recommend monitoring of liver function tests and HCV-RNA serum levels during treatment."

This work compares the clinical, virologic, and histologic characteristics of patients with occult dual infection to those of patients with single occult HBV or HCV infection. Seventy-six patients with abnormal liver function tests of unknown etiology (serum HBsAg, anti-HCV, HBV-DNA, and HCV-RNA negative) were included in the study. Viral genomes were tested in liver by real-time PCR and confirmed by in situ hybridization. Of the 76 patients, 17 had occult HBV infection (intrahepatic HBV-DNA positive, HCV-RNA negative), 35 had occult HCV infection (intrahepatic HCV-RNA positive, HBV-DNA negative) and 24 occult dual infection (intrahepatic HCV-RNA and HBV-DNA). No differences among the three groups were found regarding clinical and epidemiologic data. The median load of intrahepatic genomic and antigenomic HCV-RNA strands was similar between single occult HCV infection and occult HBV and HCV dual infection. The percentage of HCV-infected hepatocytes did not differ between these groups. In occult single HBV infection, intrahepatic levels of HBV-DNA and percentage of HBV-infected hepatocytes were similar to the group of patients with occult dual infection. Finally, no differences were found in histological liver damage among the three groups. In conclusion, liver disease in patients with occult dual infection was not more severe than in patients with single occult HBV or occult HCV infection. Moreover, in occult dual infection there is no a reciprocal inhibition of the viral genomes."
15233,0.005,1.0000,"A 70-year-old Japanese woman with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was diagnosed with polymyositis and treated with high-dose prednisolone (PSL). The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level increased from 78 to 345 U/l 1 week after initiating treatment, although the polymyositis settled promptly. Furthermore, the serum HCV RNA level increased markedly from 110 to 850 kIU/ml 3 weeks after starting treatment. Previously, the patient had suffered an occlusion of the left branch of the retinal vein secondary to hyperviscosity syndrome resulting from Sjögren's syndrome and low-dose PSL treatment had been commenced. The serum HCV RNA and transaminase levels had not increased during this low-dose PSL treatment. Although intensive immunosuppression is necessary as an initial treatment of several collagen diseases including polymyositis, high-dose PSL therapy may markedly augment the serum HCV RNA level and therefore careful observation is necessary in HCV-infected patients."
17727,0.005,1.0000,"The chronic course of hepatitis E virus infection in immunosuppressed patients has been recently documented; however, clinical features and factors associated with this occurrence are not well known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of previous or current HEV infection in renal transplant patients. One hundred ninety-two kidney transplant patients were studied and classified in three groups: G1-infected with hepatitis B and/or C virus; G2-patients with elevated ALT; G3-patients with normal ALT and no hepatotropic virus infection. Demographic, epidemiologic and clinical characteristics were compared between the groups. Patients with HEV infection (previous or current) were also compared to those who tested negative for HEV. HEV infection was detected using serologic (anti-HEV IgG) and molecular (HEV RNA) methods. Anti-HEV IgG was positive in 28 (15%) while HEV RNA was positive in 20 (10%). When both markers were considered, 44 (23%) patients showed evidence of previous or current HEV infection. However, both markers were concomitantly positive in only four cases (2%). In the comparative analysis, patients infected with HBV and/or HCV showed lower frequency of anti-HEV IgG (P = 0.009). There was no difference regarding demographic, epidemiologic and laboratory variable between viremic and non-viremic patients. In conclusion, past and current infection with HEV was a frequent finding among renal transplant recipients. Actively infected patients (HEV RNA positive) did not present distinct demographic and epidemiological characteristics or laboratory alterations suggestive of underlying liver damage. Therefore, infection with HEV can only be detected in immunosuppressed patients by systematic investigation of HEV RNA."
2709,0.005,1.0000,"We determined and analyzed risk factors of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected Brazilian hemophiliacs according to their virological, clinical and epidemiological characteristics. A cross-sectional and retrospective study of 469 hemophiliacs was carried out at a Brazilian blood center starting in October 1997. The prevalence of HCV infection, HCV genotypes and factors associated with HCV RNA detection was determined. The seroprevalence of anti-HCV antibodies (ELISA-3.0) was 44.6% (209/469). Virological, clinical and epidemiological assessments were completed for 162 positive patients. There were seven (4.3%) anti-HCV seroconversions between October 1992 and October 1997. During the same period, 40.8% of the positive anti-HCV hemophiliacs had abnormal alanine transaminase (ALT) levels. Plasma HCV RNA was detected by nested-RT-PCR in 116 patients (71.6%). RFLP analysis showed the following genotype distribution: HCV-1 in 98 hemophiliacs (84.5%), HCV-3 in ten (8.6%), HCV-4 in three (2.6%), HCV-2 in one (0.9%), and not typeable in four cases (3.4%). Univariate analysis indicated that older age (P = 0.017) and abnormal ALT levels (P = 0.010) were associated with HCV viremia, while the presence of inhibitor antibodies (P = 0.024) and HBsAg (P = 0.007) represented a protective factor against the presence of HCV RNA. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between HCV infection and hemophilia."
5674,0.005,1.0000,"In order to evaluate the evolution of transfusional hepatitis C in haemophiliacs, we performed a retrospective study of ALT levels and HCV viraemia with a RNA PCR assay in 57 patients. We found that the vast majority of HCV-infected patients remained viraemic (43/57 = 75%) and higher ALT levels correlated with HCV viraemia. Although indicators of the transfusional viral load (age, severity of haemophilia) and HBV co-infection did not correlate with HCV RNA replication, HIV seropositivity was strongly associated with persistence of HCV viraemia (23/25 = 92% in HIV-positive versus 20/32 = 62% in HIV-negative patients), without any correlation with CD4 counts. Genotyping of HCV in the 43 viraemic patients shows more frequent genotype 1 in the HIV-seropositive group (14/23) than in the seronegative group (6/20). Our data emphasize that besides the role of the immunodeficiency status, the genotypes of HCV might be involved in the differences observed in terms of HCV RNA replication between the HIV-seropositive and seronegative haemophiliacs."
18116,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (HGV) is an RNA virus, which appears to be transmitted by parenteral exposure to contaminated blood and blood products, and may be associated with clinical hepatitis in humans. The prevalence of HGV was investigated in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients, and (HCV)-contaminated immune globulin intravenous products (IGIV), manufactured prior to the introduction of viral inactivation processing, and in recipients of these lots. Nested primers, specific for the 5' non-coding region of HGV, were designed and used to test 100 chronic HCV patients, 10 HCV RNA-positive IGIV lots and 36 of the recipients of these products. Hepatitis G virus specificity of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products was confirmed by sequencing a number of the amplified products and comparing the results with the published prototype sequence for HGV RNA. HGV RNA was detected in 23 of the 100 (23%) HCV-infected patients. The level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was lower in HCV-HGV coinfected patients than those with HCV infection alone. Hence, the severity of HCV infections is not influenced by HGV. Two of the 10 (20%) IGIV lots tested positive for HGV RNA; however, none of the serum samples from recipients of IGIV contained detectable HGV RNA although many were infected with HCV. This suggests that the transmission of HGV RNA from IGIV to the recipients is less efficient than that seen for HCV."
1571,0.005,1.0000,"The role of HBV and HCV in the course of primary liver cancer in patients who are negative for HBsAg has been debated. Using a combination of serological and polymerase chain reaction assays, we investigated the association between HCV and HBV infections and primary liver cancer in 24 HBsAg-negative patients living in France. The presence of HCV RNA and HBV DNA sequences was tested for in serum and in tumorous and nontumorous liver samples. Twelve patients had anti-HCV, and 11 patients had anti-HBs and/or anti-HBc. HCV RNA sequences were found in the serum samples of all anti-HCV-positive patients and none of the patients who were negative. Patients with HCV viremia had HCV RNA genomic sequences and presumed replicative intermediates in both tumorous and nontumorous specimens. Sequence analysis of a hypervariable region in the E2/NS1 gene of HCV showed significant variations between the viral molecules isolated from the nontumorous, tumorous and serum samples. This eliminated the hypothesis of the contamination of the tumor by nontumorous cells and serum particles and assessed that liver tumor cells did contain HCV RNA genomes. Eleven of 22 patients tested had HBV DNA in the serum; 5 patients were anti-HBc positive and anti-HBs positive. Patients with HBV viremia had HBV DNA sequences in both tumorous and nontumorous liver specimens. Selective loss of part of the HBV genome in the tumorous tissue of two of these patients suggested HBV DNA persistence in clonally expanded malignant cells. Only 4 of the 22 patients were negative for both viruses. Our results show that HBsAg-negative hepatocellular cancer in France is associated with chronic HBV or HCV infection and, in some cases, both; these findings are consistent with an etiological role for HBV and HCV in HCC that develops in cirrhotic patients living in areas of low prevalence."
16146,0.005,1.0000,"This study looked at 102 anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive, hepatitis B virus (HBV)-negative, and HIV-negative patients (median age, 45.1 years; range, 15-71) affected by hereditary bleeding disorders who have been infected with HCV for 15 to 34 years (median, 25.1). All these patients were infected before the mid 1980s because of non-virally inactivated pooled blood products. Fourteen patients (13.7%) were HCV-RNA negative with no signs of liver disease and were considered to have cleared the virus. Eighty-eight patients (86.3%) were HCV-RNA positive. The HCV genotype distribution was 1a in 20.5%, 1b in 36.4%, 2 in 17.0%, 3 in 15.9%, 4 in 3.4%, and mixed in 6.8% of cases. Twenty-four patients (23.5%) had serum cryoglobulins, symptomatic in 4 cases, and associated with liver disease and with genotype 1. Among the 88 HCV-RNA-positive patients, 15 (17.0%) had normal alanine aminotransferase levels and abdominal ultrasound, 61 (69.3%) had nonprogressive chronic hepatitis, and 12 (13.7%) had severe liver disease (6 [6.9%] liver cirrhosis, 4 [4.5%] hepatic decompensation, and 2 [2.3%] hepatocellular carcinoma) after a follow-up period of 25 years. There were 3 (3.4%) liver-related deaths. HCV genotype 1, patient's age at evaluation, duration of infection, and severity of congenital bleeding disorder were associated with more advanced liver disease. The results confirm the slow progression of HCV infection in HIV-negative hemophiliacs."
8884,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated maternal sexual behavior and injection drug use practices as possible risk factors for vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Data were analyzed from the Mothers and Infants Cohort Study, a prospective study in Brooklyn and the Bronx, New York. A total of 207 mother-infant sets were enrolled between 1986 and 1991 and followed for up to 4 years after the enrollment visit during pregnancy. HIV-1 transmission occurred in 49 of 201 mother-infant sets, yielding an overall transmission rate of 24.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 18.7% to 31.0%). Increased frequency of vaginal intercourse after the first trimester of pregnancy was positively associated with vertical transmission of HIV-1 (trend p = 0.03). A lifetime history of injection drug use was not associated with vertical transmission. However, a history of combined cocaine and heroin injection after the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with vertical HIV-1 transmission, particularly among women with CD4+ lymphocyte levels of 20% or higher (risk ratio = 4.0; 95% CI = 2.0 to 8.1). Cocaine and heroin injection drug use after the first trimester accounted for most of the relation between preterm birth and vertical HIV-1 transmission in this cohort. Maternal coinfection with hepatitis C virus or human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II could not explain these observations, because coinfection with these viruses had no detectable effect on HIV-1 transmission. These results suggest that maternal sexual behavior and injection drug use practices during the second and third trimester of pregnancy may modify the risk of vertical HIV-1 transmission."
18228,0.005,1.0000,"Mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a significant problem in countries with endemic HIV-1 infection. Between 1986 and 1991, 365 children of HIV-1-infected mothers and 363 control children were studied in Kenya. The overall risk of transmission from mother to child, determined by serologic evidence of infection by age > or = 12 months and excess mortality in the HIV-1-exposed group, was 42.8% (range, 27.6%-62.2%). Marriage was the only maternal characteristic associated with transmission (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.2; P < .05). Children who experienced growth failure were more likely to be infected. In 44% of children ultimately infected, the pattern of antibody response implied intrapartum or postnatal exposure to HIV-1. Of potential postnatal exposures examined, duration of breast-feeding beyond age 15 months and the mother being married were independently associated with increased risk of infection and seroconversion of children. The percentage of HIV infection attributable to breast-feeding > or = 15 months was 32%. The frequency of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 was high; a substantial proportion of infection occurred postnatally, possibly through breast-feeding."
15573,0.005,1.0000,"To evaluate the seropositivity of Chlamydia spp. in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects in Japan, Chlamydia-specific antibodies in sera collected from 106 HIV-infected subjects were measured by the microimmunofluorescence test. The prevalence of C. pneumoniae-specific IgA, C. trachomatis-specific IgG and IgA and mean titers were significantly higher in the homosexual and heterosexual HIV-infected subjects than in the hemophilic patients and HIV-negative controls. These data indicate that the higher C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis seroprevalence among HIV-infected subjects is probably due to an HIV risk factor, such as promiscuous sexual behavior, rather than to HIV infection itself."
8569,0.005,1.0000,"With the recent demonstration in the RV144 Thai trial that a vaccine regimen that does not elicit neutralizing antibodies or cytotoxic T lymphocytes may confer protection against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, attention has turned to nonneutralizing antibodies as a possible mechanism of vaccine protection. In the current study, we evaluated the kinetics of the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) response during acute and chronic SIVmac251 infection of rhesus monkeys. We first adapted a flow cytometry-based ADCC assay, evaluating the use of different target cells as well as different strategies for quantitation of activated natural killer (NK) cells. We found that the use of SIVmac251 Env gp130-coated target cells facilitates analyses of ADCC activity with a higher degree of sensitivity than the use of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected target cells; however, the kinetics of the measured responses were the same using these different target cells. By comparing NK cell expression of CD107a with NK cell expression of other cytokines or chemokine molecules, we found that measuring CD107a expression is sufficient for evaluating the anti-SIV function of NK cells. We also showed that ADCC responses can be detected as early as 3 weeks after SIVmac251 infection and that the magnitude of this antibody response is inversely associated with plasma viral RNA levels in animals with moderate to high levels of viral replication. However, we also demonstrated an association between NK cell-mediated ADCC responses and the amount of SIVmac251 gp140 binding antibody that developed after viral infection. This final observation raises the possibility that the antibodies that mediate ADCC are a subset of the antibodies detected in a binding assay and arise within weeks of infection."
5979,0.005,1.0000,"To determine the rate and risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 subtype E perinatal transmission, with focus on virus load, pregnant HIV-infected women and their formula-fed infants were followed prospectively in Bangkok. Of 281 infants with known outcome, 68 were infected (transmission rate, 24.2%; 95% confidence interval, 19.3%-29.6%). Transmitting mothers had a 4.3-fold higher median plasma HIV RNA level at delivery than did nontransmitters (P<.001). No transmission occurred at <2000 copies/mL. On multivariate analysis, prematurity (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4.5), vaginal delivery (AOR, 2.9), low NK cell percentage (AOR, 2.4), and maternal virus load were associated with transmission. As RNA quintiles increased, the AOR for transmission increased linearly from 4.5 to 24.8. Two-thirds of transmission was attributed to virus load>10,000 copies/mL. Although risk is multifactorial, high maternal virus load at delivery strongly predicts transmission. This may have important implications for interventions designed to reduce perinatal transmission."
15966,0.005,1.0000,"To gain further knowledge on the subject we evaluated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gene expression and TCD4+, TCD8+, and B lymphocyte counts in lung tissue samples from 20 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children with chronic lung disease. Twenty HIV-1 infected children with chronic pulmonary disease underwent open lung biopsy to define the diagnosis. Histological section of this material was submitted to nonisotopic in situ hybridization (ISH) using EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) 1/2 probes and TCD4+, TCD8+, and CD20+ B-cell counts by immunohistochemistry. The histology of 16 out of the 20 children (median age 53.5 months) proved to be examples of pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia/lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis (PLH/LIP) complex, 13 of which were EBER positive, but no significant association was found (Fisher exact test P = 0.439). Four patients had non-LIP diseases (3, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia; 1, diffuse advanced alveolar damage), two being EBER negative. Nineteen children showed a predominant T-CD8+ cell response (CD4+/CD8+ <1) in lung tissue. The mean TCD4+ and theTCD4/TCD8 ratio in lung tissue were significantly higher in the sections with PLH/LIP complex, but without significant difference between EBER positive and EBER negative samples. EBV gene expression was detected in the majority of the lung samples but without significant association with PLH/LIP complex or with TCD4+, TCD8+, B cells and the TCD4+/TCD8+ ratio. Regarding the pattern of lung disease in HIV-1 infected children, associated or not to EBV, the findings are of importance concerning the possible role of EBV in the pathogenesis of PLH/LIP."
4399,0.005,1.0000,"We established four new mouse strains with defective T and B cells as well as defects in innate immunological reactions using an NK cell depletion antibody and showed that all mutant mouse strains efficiently received human peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) engraftment (hu-PBL-scid mice). Higher levels of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication were observed in these new hu-PBL-scid mice than in conventional hu-PBL-C.B-17-scid mice. In one particular strain, hu-PBL-NOD-scid mice, high levels of HIV-1 viremia (more than 10(6) 50% infectious doses per ml) were detected after infection with HIV-1. The plasma viral load was about 100 to 1,000 times higher than that observed in other hu-PBL-scid mice infected with HIV-1. Although high-level viremia did not correlate with the total amount of HIV-1 RNA in cells from infected mice, high levels of free virions were detected only in hu-PBL-NOD-scid mice. HIV-1 viremia induced systemic HIV-1 infection involving the liver, lungs, and brain. PCR in situ hybridization confirmed that HIV-1-infected cells invaded the brain tissue of the hu-PBL-NOD-scid mice. Our results suggest that the genetic background, including innate immunity, is critical in the development of primary HIV-1 viremia and subsequent central nervous system invasion with HIV-1. The hu-PBL-NOD-scid mouse represents a useful model for the study of the pathogenesis of HIV-1 in vivo, especially brain involvement, and therapy of primary HIV-1 viremia."
9229,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic liver disease due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major problem in hemophiliacs. Recent reports suggested that hemophiliacs coinfected with hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have an increased incidence of liver failure but the mechanism of accelerated liver injury is not clear. We tested plasma from 100 hemophiliacs for anti-HCV by second generation ELISA, anti-HIV by EIA, and HCV RNA and HIV RNA by branched DNA and polymerase chain reaction assays to determine if hemophiliacs coinfected with HCV and HIV have higher HCV RNA levels and more active liver disease. Seventy-nine (79%) patients were anti-HCV positive, of whom 85% were HCV RNA positive. None of the anti-HCV-negative patients had detectable HCV RNA in plasma. Forty-two (42%) patients were anti-HIV positive, of whom 47% had detectable HIV RNA. All the anti-HIV-positive patients were also anti-HCV positive. The prevalence of both anti-HCV and anti-HIV increased significantly with age. There was no difference in HCV RNA levels between anti-HIV-positive and anti-HIV-negative patients (mean: 21 +/- 4 vs 18 +/- 5 Meq/ml), although HCV RNA levels were significantly higher in anti-HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts < 200/mm3 (P = 0.008). There was an inverse correlation between HCV RNA levels and CD4 counts but no correlation was found between HCV RNA and serum aminotransferase levels. We found a high prevalence of HCV and HIV coinfection in our hemophiliacs. Hepatitis C virus replication appears to be increased in patients with severe immunodeficiency secondary to progressive HIV infection. However, there was no correlation between HCV RNA and serum ALT level, suggesting that HCV is not directly cytopathic."
16184,0.005,1.0000,"The duration of the GB virus C or hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) carriership varies according to the patient group studied. The immune competence of the host may be important. GBV-C/ HGV was studied in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons and an attempt was made to correlate the presence of viral RNA or E2 antibodies with CD4+ lymphocyte counts. Of 138 HIV-positive subjects, 30 were GBV-C/HGV RNA-positive and 20 others were E2 antibody-positive, whereas in healthy GBV-C/HGV-infected persons, the proportion of E2 antibody carriers was much higher. On the other hand, a relationship was not found between CD4+ lymphocyte counts and the presence of GBV-C/HGV RNA in the HIV-infected persons. This result does not necessarily imply that the CD4+ lymphocyte count does not affect viral clearance, but the results could be due to the trans-sectional nature of this study. A longitudinal assessment should clarify this point."
18447,0.005,1.0000,"We examined the association between host factors present near the time of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) acquisition and subsequent virus loads, in a prospective cohort study of women in Mombasa, Kenya. Women were prospectively followed monthly before HIV-1 infection. One hundred sixty-one commercial sex workers who became infected with HIV-1 were followed for a median of 34 months, and 991 plasma samples collected > or =4 months after infection were tested for HIV-1 RNA. The median virus set point at 4 months after infection was 4.46 log10 copies/mL, and the average virus load increase during subsequent follow-up was 0.0094 log10 copies/mL/month. In a multivariate analysis that controlled for sexual behavior, the use of the injectable contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) at the time of HIV-1 infection was associated with a higher virus set point, and the presence of genital ulcer disease (GUD) during the early phase of HIV-1 infection was associated with greater change in virus load during follow-up. These findings suggest that, in women, the use of DMPA and the presence of GUD during the early phase of HIV-1 infection may influence the natural course of infection."
16547,0.005,1.0000,"During chronic viral infections, T cells are exhausted due to constant antigen exposure and are associated with enhanced programmed death 1 (PD-1) expression. Deficiencies in the PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway are associated with autoimmune diseases, including those of the central nervous system (CNS). To understand the role of PD-1 expression in regulating T-cell immunity in the CNS during chronic infection, we characterized PD-1 expression in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood of individuals with chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. PD-1 expression was higher on HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells than on total CD8(+) T cells in both CSF and blood. PD-1 expression on CSF T cells correlated positively with CSF HIV-1 RNA and inversely with blood CD4(+) T-cell counts, suggesting that HIV-1 infection drives higher PD-1 expression on CSF T cells. However, in every HIV-positive individual, PD-1 expression was higher on T cells in CSF than on those in blood, despite HIV-1 RNA levels being lower. Among healthy HIV-negative controls, PD-1 expression was higher in CSF than in blood. Furthermore, frequencies of the senescence marker CD57 were lower on CSF T cells than on blood T cells, consistent with our prior observation of enhanced ex vivo functional capacity of CSF T cells. The higher PD-1 expression level on CSF T cells therefore does not reflect cellular exhaustion but may be a mechanism to downregulate immune-mediated tissue damage in the CNS. As inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is pursued as a therapeutic option for viral infections, potential effects of such a blockade on development of autoimmune responses in the CNS should be considered."
15836,0.005,1.0000,"Illicit drug use in HIV-infected patients can be linked to impairment of physical and mental health, low health related quality of life, and suboptimal adherence to HIV treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation of self report illicit drug use, urinalysis for cocaine and cannabis metabolites, and severity of dependence among HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a treatment center in Brazil. Four hundred and thirty-eight outpatients of an HIV referral center were interviewed and assessed for drug use (lifetime, last year and last month). Urinalysis was performed to detect the presence of cocaine and cannabis metabolites in urine samples. Overall agreement between self report and urinalysis was almost 68% for cannabis and higher than 85% for cocaine. Positive urinalysis was significantly associated with more than once a week cannabis (p< .0001) and cocaine (p< .0001) use during the last-month. Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) properly predicted positive cocaine urinalysis results (area under the curve [AUC] = .81, p = .0001). Frequency of cannabis and cocaine use, SDS score degree and positive urinalysis for both drugs were correlated. Our findings suggest that positive self-report is a reliable predictor of positive urine sample both for cannabis and cocaine, but since the agreement was not perfect, there is a role for urine drug screening in the care of patients with HIV-related conditions."
9473,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and genetic variability of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among 205 patients with clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in Buenos Aires in 2001. Infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV), HIV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV), Treponema pallidum and human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I/II were diagnosed in 37/187 (19.8 %), 35/205 (17.1 %), 22/187 (11.8 %), 13/187 (7.0 %) and 4/181 (2.2 %) patients, respectively. Almost one in three participants (33.1 %) presented at least one infection in addition to TB. Multiresistance to TB drugs (isoniazid plus rifampicin) was detected in the isolates recovered from three patients. Injecting drug use was detected as the main risk factor for HIV, HBV and HCV infections. Of ten patients who died, eight were infected with HIV. HIV genetic characterization showed the presence of two different subtypes. Env subtype F was found in 13/24 samples (54.2 %) and subtype B in 11/24 samples (45.8 %) by heteroduplex mobility assay. Sequencing of the protease/RT region was performed in ten samples: three were characterized as subtype B and seven as B/F recombinants by bootscanning analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of four full-length sequences showed that three were the circulating recombinant form CRF12_BF. The results of this study suggest an urgent need to detect HIV infection in high-risk groups to prevent future HIV transmission as well as morbidity and mortality associated with TB by providing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and/or TB treatment. Collaboration between TB and HIV programmes seems to be the best approach to decrease the incidence of these diseases, especially in high-prevalence HIV settings."
7722,0.005,1.0000,"We have investigated the level of lymphocytosis present in the lung of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1+ infected patients with and without pulmonary disease and how changes in natural killer (NK), B and T-cells seen in peripheral blood (PB) compare with those seen in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Lymphocyte subpopulations and their expression of activation, cytotoxic markers and memory status were characterized by triple immunofluorescence. Macrophages accounted for over 80% of the BAL cells. Only three out of 72 patients had a lymphocyte percentage >30%. No statistically significant differences in the relative proportions of NK, CD4 and CD8 populations were seen in BALF when compared to PB, except for a twofold increase in the percentage of activated CD8 cells in BALF. The only differences in BALF populations between the HIV-1+ groups were a lower percentage of CD4+ cells, and a higher percentage of activated CD8+ cells in the patients with pneumonitis. In the present cohort of patients there was little evidence for an overall lymphocytosis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of HIV-1+ subjects. Changes observed in lymphocyte subsets of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid populations reflected those in peripheral blood, and were similar for patients with and without pneumonitis. Evidence of increased CD8 subset activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid did, however, emerge."
19423,0.005,1.0000,"Major histocompatibility class I-peptide tetramer technology and simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac)-infected rhesus monkeys were used to clarify the distribution of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in secondary lymphoid organs and to assess the relationship between these CTL and the extent of viral replication in the various anatomic compartments. SIVmac Gag epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells were evaluated in the spleen, bone marrow, tonsils, thymus, and 5 different lymph node compartments of 4 SIVmac-infected rhesus monkeys. The average percentage of CD8(+) T lymphocytes that bound this tetramer in all the different lymph node compartments was similar to that in peripheral blood lymphocytes in individual monkeys. The percentage of CD8(+) T cells that bound the tetramer in the thymus was uniformly low in the monkeys. However, the percentage of CD8(+) T cells that bound the tetramer in bone marrow and spleen was consistently higher than that seen in lymph nodes and peripheral blood. The phenotypic profile of the tetramer-binding CD8(+) T lymphocytes in the different lymphoid compartments was similar, showing a high expression of activation-associated adhesion molecules and a low level expression of naive T-cell-associated molecules. Surprisingly, no correlation was evident between the percentage of tetramer-binding CD8(+) T lymphocytes and the magnitude of the cell-associated SIV RNA level in each lymphoid compartment of individual monkeys. These studies suggest that a dynamic process of trafficking may obscure the tendency of CTL to localize in particular regional lymph nodes or that some lymphoid organs may provide milieus that are particularly conducive to CTL expansion.

8614,0.005,1.0000,"Our aim was to evaluate the quality of pulmonary surfactant, a nonspecific defence system, during the course of human immunodeficiency virus) infection. Protein and phospholipid composition were determined in 127 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from 89 HIV seropositive patients (54 acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), 35 non-AIDS) and 11 healthy controls. In all of the HIV BAL samples, biochemical abnormalities were found. In subjects with pulmonary infection or Kaposi's sarcoma, the phospholipid/protein ratio was decreased, mainly because of elevated protein levels (15.8 and 20, respectively, vs 7.2 mg.100 ml-1 for controls, p < 0.05). In subjects without obvious pulmonary involvement, phospholipid was decreased (1.3 +/- 0.2 vs 2.9 +/- 0.3 mg.100 ml-1 for controls, p < 0.001), whereas the protein was not altered. Phospholipid composition was also altered: the phosphatidylcholine percentage was decreased, whilst the other main phospholipids were increased. We conclude that the alveolar lining is altered, whatever the stage of HIV disease. In most patients, it results from an increase of vascular permeability, with an influx of serum proteins. However, changes in phospholipid composition suggest that, in some cases, surfactant is also altered."

We investigated these issues in the context of a volunteer who received six HIV-1LAI envelope immunizations and 10 weeks thereafter acquired HIV-1 infection through a high-risk sexual exposure. In contrast to nonvaccinated acutely infected individuals, anamnestic HIV-1-specific B- and T-cell responses appeared within 3 weeks in this individual, and neutralizing antibody preceded CD8+ cytotoxic responses. Despite an asymptomatic course and an initial low level of detectable infectious virus, a progressive CD4+ cell decline and dysfunction occurred within 2 years. Although vaccination elicited immunity to HIV-1 envelope, which was recalled upon HIV-1 exposure, it was insufficient to prevent infection and subsequent immunodeficiency."

Nine (50%) of the HW and all HIV-seropositive persons had HIV-specific T cell responses. Only 2 (22%) of the HEPS responders recognized Env, compared with 94% of HIV-seropositive persons. A high percentage (75%) of the HW with HIV-specific T cell responses reported recent HIV exposure.

These findings have important implications for HIV vaccine design."
16840,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the receipt of antiretroviral therapy have been associated with the development of cardiovascular disease. The occurrence of cardiovascular events in HIV-infected patients has often been associated with treatment-induced dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and body composition changes. These treatment-related complications are often the result of exposures to protease inhibitors or thymidine analogs such as stavudine or zidovudine. Recent investigations, however, have suggested an association between exposure to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, abacavir, and the occurrence of cardiovascular disease events. Based on these findings, current guidelines recommend using caution in patients receiving abacavir who are at a high risk for cardiovascular disease. Decisions to replace abacavir in a patient's regimen should be considered on an individual basis and with complete evaluation of the associated benefits and risks. Furthermore, additional studies are necessary to definitively determine the association between abacavir exposure and the occurrence of cardiovascular disease events. Studies are also necessary to definitively identify the contributions of both HIV infection and individual antiretroviral agents on the development of cardiovascular disease."

It was found that both IL-12 and CTB were required to elicit mucosal antibody responses and that i.n. immunization resulted in increased total, immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), and IgG2a anti-HIV-1 antibody levels in serum; increased total, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgA antibody expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids; and increased IgA antibody levels in vaginal washes. Levels of anti-HIV-1 antibodies in both sera and secretions were higher in groups immunized with gp140 than in those immunized with gp120. However, only gp120-specific mucosal antibodies demonstrated neutralizing activity against HIV-1 89.6. Taken together, the results show that IL-12 and CTB act synergistically to enhance both systemic and local mucosal antibody responses to HIV-1 glycoproteins and that even though gp140 induces higher antibody titers than gp120, only gp120-specific mucosal antibodies interfere with virus infectivity."

The role of anti-GBV-C antibodies in HIV-infected patients also remains unknown. At present, there are no commercial systems to detect specific markers of GBV-C infection. The research presented follows our previous work from which we obtained chimeric molecules formed by two domains of different GBV-C proteins with good sensitivity/specificity balances in the detection of anti-GBV-C antibodies in hemodialyzed and chronic hepatitis patient samples. It has been investigated the ability of the synthetic peptides to recognize specific anti-GBV-C antibodies in HIV and HCV/HIV co-infected patients by a peptide-based ELISA immunoassay. The results showed that human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients have a significantly higher frequency of anti-GBV-C antibodies than healthy controls. A comparison between HCV(+) /HIV(+) and HCV(-) /HIV(+) was analyzed. Although a higher percentage of HCV/HIV-positive sera were positive for antibodies against GBV-C peptides, the difference was not significant. The presence of anti-GBV-C antibodies could represent a good marker of exposure to GBV-C in HIV-infected patients to facilitate a further analysis of the effect of this exposure in the progression of illness caused by HIV infection."

However, due to difficulties in diagnosis and reporting, true burden of HIV-associated TB in children is unknown. The objective of this study was to describe the incidence of pulmonary TB (PTB) after antiretroviral therapy (ART) and to study risk factors. A retrospective study was performed based on routinely collected data from China national pediatric free antiretroviral treatment database. A total of 3365 children under 15 years on ART from July 2005 to October 2012 were included. Multivariable logistic regression was used to detect associated factors. Two thousand nine hundred and ninety (89%) children got infected from HIV-positive mother, with median age of 6.7 (4.1, 10.0) years at highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation in this program. Seventy-seven (2.3%) children were diagnosed with PTB after ART during 7.3 years cohort observation. Median time of occurrence was 212 (30-514) days. Overall incidence was 0.83 (0.65-1.01)/100 person-years (py), with the peak of 3.6/100 py in the first 3 months after antiretroviral treatment. WHO stage IV at baseline showed 2 (95% CI 1.0-6.8) times more risk for developing TB. Late clinical stage at ART initiation was shown to relate with TB incidence. PTB coinfection leads to higher mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment of HIV are highly required to reduce HIV-associated morbidity and mortality due to TB. "

In the concentrated HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgendered women (TGW) in Lima, Peru, the independent correlates of ART nonadherence were examined to inform treatment intervention priorities. Cross sectional survey of HIV-infected MSM and TGW who are engaged in clinical care in Lima, Peru. From June to August 2012, 302 HIV-infected Peruvian MSM/TGW from three clinical care sites were recruited using convenience sampling to participate in a cross-sectional computer-assisted adherence survey. Several standardized screening measures associated with ART nonadherence were examined in order to determine the independent correlates of optimal (≥90%) and perfect (100%) adherence, which were assessed using logistic regression. Of the 302 participants recruited, 263 (87.1%) were prescribed ART. Among those prescribed ART, 229 (87.1%) reported optimal and 146 (55.5%) reported perfect adherence. The prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUD; 43.2%), alcohol dependence (5.3%), recent drug use (6.0%), and depression (44.5%) was high, and most participants had some evidence of neurocognitive impairment. Meeting criteria for having an AUD and depression were collinear (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, having an AUD was inversely related and the only independent correlate of optimal (AOR = 0.427; 95% CI = 0.187-0.976) and perfect (AOR = 0.552; 95% CI = 0.327-0.930) ART adherence. AUDs are highly prevalent among Peruvian HIV-infected MSM and contribute significantly to ART nonadherence. These findings support the need for screening and treating underlying AUDs. In order to meet HIV TasP goals, evidence-based strategies targeting AUDs are likely to directly improve ART adherence and indirectly improve overall individual health, HIV treatment engagement, and reduce transmission to sexual partners among this vulnerable and disproportionally affected population."

Genotypic resistance testing prior to the initiation of NA therapy may facilitate the selection of optimal drug regime and help to prevent early emergence of clinical resistance. In this study, presence of resistance mutations in treatment-naive individuals with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) was investigated in Hacettepe University Hospital, a referral center in Ankara province, Turkey. A total of 42 patients (17 female, 25 male; age range: 18-62 years) diagnosed as CHB were enrolled in the study with informed consent. All of the patients were negative for hepatitis C and D viruses and human immunodeficiency virus coinfections, and none had a history of interferon or NA treatment. HBV viral load, HBV markers and hepatic enzymes in patients were determined via standardized commercial assays. For the detection of NA resistance mutations, a partial sequence of approximately 250 nucleotides, harboring the frequently-observed sites for NA resistance was amplified via nested PCR and characterized by direct sequencing of the amplicons. The sequences were handled and interpreted for the presence of mutations via various softwares and a web-based virtual phenotyping tool. Well-characterized sequences were obtained in 30 out of 42 samples (71.4%). All circulating HBV strains were observed as genotype D. Nucleotide variations were detected in 19 individuals (63.5%) that comprise silent mutations without amino acid substitution in 8 (26.6%), mutations with undetermined significance in 7 (23.3%) and mutations associated with NA resistance in 3 (10%) patients. Mutations conferring resistance to entecavir + lamivudine (S202G, M204V, L180M, T184N) were identified in one patient whereas L180P, A181Q and A194V substitutions associated with probable lamivudin + adefovir and tenofovir resistance, respectively, were detected in other patients. All patients with resistance mutations were HBsAg and HBeAg positive, anti-HBe negative and had viral loads exceeding 3 x 10(7) IU/ml. In two patients, the route for HBV transmission was vertical. Since no follow-up samples were available from individuals with resistance mutations, alterations in serological markers, viral load and mutation patterns could not be monitored. In conclusion, the presence of NA resistance mutations were revealed in treatment-naive CHB cases in a referral hospital in Turkey. The impact and cost-effectivity of detecting naturally-occurring resistance mutations for clinical follow-up prior to the antiviral therapy need to be elucidated by prospective studies."

The objective of this study was to determine predictors of ART-associated TB in adults with HIV infection at Jimma University Hospital, Ethiopia. A nested case-control study was conducted in October 2009. The study population consisted of adults with HIV infection (aged >14 years) who developed active TB in the first six months since ART initiation and controls that did not develop active TB. Data were collected using a structured and pretested questionnaire. Cox proportions hazards analysis was done to determine predictors of ART-associated TB. A total of 357 patients (119 cases and 238 controls) participated in the study. After six months of follow-up, cumulative incidence of ART-associated TB was 5.2% (123/2355). Forty (33.6%) cases were lost to follow-up after they developed ART-associated TB and 11 (9.2%) died. Fifty-one (21.4%) controls interrupted ART and 11 (4.6%) died.

10235,0.005,1.0000,"Patients with human immunodeficiency virus 1-associated immunological thrombocytopenia (HIV-1-ITP) have markedly elevated platelet-bound immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, and C3C4, as well as serum circulating immune complexes (CICs) composed of the same. Affinity purification of IgGs from their CICs with fixed platelets reveals high-affinity antibody (Ab) against platelet glycoprotein (GP)IIIa 49-66, which correlates inversely with their platelet count. However, sera from these patients have little to no anti-GPIIIa activity. To investigate this, we assayed serum, purified serum IgG, and CIC-Ig from these patients. This revealed approximately 150-fold greater Ab activity in purified serum IgG, and approximately 4,000-fold greater reactivity in CIC-IgG. This was shown to be associated with the presence of antiidiotype Ab2 (both IgG and IgM) sequestered in the CIC-IgG. The IgM antiidiotype was predominantly blocking Ab, as demonstrated by specificity for F(ab')(2) fragments of anti-GPIIIa 49-66 of HIV-1-ITP patients and inhibition of reactivity with peptide GPIIIa 49-66, not with a control peptide. The IgM antiidiotype was not polyreactive. Similar measurements were made in nonthrombocytopenic HIV-1-infected patients. Their serum reactivity was not measurable, but serum Ig and CIC-IgG against platelet GPIIIa 49-66 was present, although considerably lower than that found in HIV-1-ITP patients (26- and 35-fold lower, respectively). In addition, their IgM antiidiotype reactivity was 12-fold greater than that found in HIV-1-ITP patients. The IgM antiidiotype Ab titer of both cohorts correlated with in vivo platelet count (r = 0.7, P = 0. 0001, n = 32). To test the in vivo effectiveness of the IgM antiidiotype, thrombocytopenia was induced in mice with 25 microgram of affinity-purified anti-GPIIIa 49-66 (mouse GPIIIa has 83% homology with human GPIIIa and Fc receptors for human IgG1). Maximum effect was obtained at 4-6 h after intraperitoneal injection into Balb/c mice with a platelet count of approximately 30% baseline value. Preincubation of the anti-GPIIIa Ab with control IgM at molar ratios of IgM/IgG of 1:7 before intraperitoneal injection had no effect on the in vivo platelet count, whereas preincubation with patient IgM antiidiotype improved the platelet count to 50-80% of normal. Thrombocytopenia could be reversed after addition of IgM antiidiotype 4 h after induction of thrombocytopenia. Thus, CICs of HIV-1-infected patients contain IgM antiidiotype Ab against anti-GPIIIa, which appears to regulate their serum reactivity in vitro and their level of thrombocytopenia in vivo."

Given the dearth of longitudinal research into ART adherence dynamics, we sought to identify factors associated with transitioning into and out of optimal adherence to ART in a longitudinal study of HIV-infected people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) in a setting of universal no-cost HIV/AIDS treatment. Using data from a prospective cohort of community-recruited HIV-positive illicit drug users confidentially linked to comprehensive HIV/AIDS treatment records, we estimated longitudinal factors associated with losing or gaining ≥95% adherence in the previous six months using two generalized linear mixed-effects models. Among 703 HIV-infected ART-exposed PWUD, becoming non-adherent was associated with periods of homelessness (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.52, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.56-4.07), active injection drug use (AOR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.01-1.56) and incarceration (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.10-2.17). Periods of sex work (AOR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.34-0.75) and injection drug use (AOR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.50-0.77) were barriers to becoming optimally adherent. Methadone maintenance therapy was associated with becoming optimally adherent (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.50-2.33) and was protective against becoming non-adherent (AOR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.41-0.65). In conclusion, we identified several behavioural, social and structural factors that shape adherence patterns among PWUD. Our findings highlight the need to consider these contextual factors in interventions that support the effective delivery of ART to this population. "

Fifty-six subjects were initially symptom free: 39 remained so during follow-up and 17 developed AIDS. Fifteen subjects were studied from the moment AIDS was diagnosed. Median serum p24 levels rose in all groups. In 50/71 individuals, p24 levels rose with time; in 21 they declined. The mean change in p24 levels was +194%. Twelve of the symptom-free subjects were subsequently treated with 1000 mg zidovudine daily for 12 months, over which period p24 levels declined in all 12 (mean change -56%). The difference in number of subjects with rising and declining p24 antigen levels between the untreated and zidovudine treated group was significant (P less than 0.001). Triton X-100 pretreatment (which presumably enables detection of virion-associated p24 in addition to free p24) of serum samples from 2 subjects who seroconverted for p24 antigen, from 2 AIDS patients who did not receive antiretroviral treatment and from 2 zidovudine-treated symptom-free subjects, did not lead to a substantial increase in p24 levels, except in the case of one of the p24 antigen seroconverters. It is concluded that the decline in serum p24 levels reported to occur during treatment with putative antiretroviral drugs can largely be ascribed to this treatment."

The mean age of the cohort was 29.9 + 4.9 years; all were men. A majority of patients (73%) achieved viral suppression (HIV-RNA <1000 copies/mL). Correlates of viral suppression include self-reported > or = 95% adherence (P < 0.01) and current use of trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (P < 0.01); current or ever diagnosed with tuberculosis was associated with viral non-suppression (P = 0.006). Tobacco use was prevalent (84%), and surprisingly 48% of patients reported active drug use; neither was associated with viral non-suppression. This is the first study to document successful ART treatment in a population of Vietnamese drug users; rates of viral suppression are comparable to other international populations. The 28% of patients without HIV-1 suppression highlight the need for adherence promotion, risk reduction programmes, and population-based surveillance strategies for assessing the emergence of HIV drug resistance in settings where access to viral load and drug resistance testing is limited."

We identified six hepatitis C virus-infected renal allograft recipients with proteinuria higher than 1.5 g/day, microhematuria, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Virologic and immunologic studies were conducted. Low serum levels of circulating immune complexes and cryoglobulins were observed, which were type II immunoglobulin G polyclonal-immunoglobulin Mk monoclonal in all six patients. Classical serum complement pathway activation and at least one type of autoantibodies were present in all of them. Hepatitis C virus RNA was found in higher concentrations in cryoprecipitate than in serum (percentage of enrichment ranged from 341 to 18,200%). Hepatitis C virus genotype was 1b in 4 of 6 patients, 1a in 1 of 6 patients, and 2a in 1 of 6 patients. In renal histology prominent parietal diffuse deposition of immunoglobulin M was the rule. Glomerular subendothelial electron-dense deposits with fibrillar appearance were observed in the two patients in which electron microscopy provided information about glomeruli. In renal allograft recipients hepatitis C virus infection may be associated with type II cryoglobulinemia which may lead to membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Immunologic and virologic studies may help to differentiate hepatitis C virus-associated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis from transplant glomerulopathy."

When serum immunoglobulin levels were included into logistic regression analysis with variables known to be associated with advanced disease (male gender, age >40 years at onset of infection, duration of infection beyond 20 years and concurrent alcohol abuse) only IgA, IgG and total immunoglobulin levels (P < 0.05, <0.05 and <0.005, respectively) emerged as independent predictors of hepatic fibrosis. Our data indicate a strong association between serum immunoglobulin levels (IgA, IgG and total) and hepatic fibrosis in patients with HCV infection. This finding supports the need to further investigate whether immunoglobulins independently promote disease progression in patients with chronic HCV infection."
140,0.005,1.0000,"Trends in sexual behavior associated with incident infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 are described and a case-control study was conducted to examine risk factors for HIV seroconversion in homosexual men who became infected with HIV between 1982 and 1994 from four geographic sites: Amsterdam, the Netherlands; San Francisco, California; Vancouver, Canada; and Sydney, Australia. Changes in sexual behaviors were evaluated from cohort visits in the preseroconversion, seroconversion, and postseroconversion intervals and were further examined over three time periods: 1982-1984, 1985-1987, and 1988-1994. In a case-control study, sexual behaviors, substance use, and presence of sexually transmitted disease were compared between 345 HIV-positive cases and 345 seronegative controls matched by visit date and site. Receptive anal intercourse was the sexual behavior most highly associated with seroconversion. The odds ratio (OR) per receptive anal intercourse partner increase was 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.09). To more carefully examine risk associated with receptive oral intercourse, analyses were done in a subgroup of men who reported no or one receptive anal intercourse partner. The risk (OR) associated with receptive oral intercourse partner increase was 1.05 (95% CI 1.0-1.11). In multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses, presence of sexually transmitted disease (OR = 3.39, 95% CI 1.95-5.91) and amphetamine use (OR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.26-5.15) were independently associated with seroconversion. Although the prevalence of major risk factors has decreased over time, the associations of these behaviors and HIV infection persist, suggesting that these risk behaviors remain important avenues for public health interventions."
10105,0.005,1.0000,"Clinicopathological features of 73 patients with alcoholic liver injury were investigated and its etiological relationship to HBV was examined. The results obtained are as follows: 1) the symptoms and histologic changes observed in this study were slightly differed from that of acute alcoholic hepatitis reported in the United States and European countries and only few cases showed similar symptoms and histologic changes compatible to acute alcoholic hepatitis. 2) Histologically, the pattern of hepatic fibrosis extending from the protal tracts into the lobule with scanty inflammatory changes was supposed to be the most characteristic features in this study. 3) Evidence of the exposure to HBV has been presented in 19 of 55 examined cases. Three cases with persistent HBs antigenemia were occasionally associated with severe hepatic changes. However, positive tests for antibodies presumably reflect the previous infection of HBV and no continuous damage due to the infection was supposed in these cases."
19632,0.005,1.0000,"Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) is characterized by serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA positive (HBsAg-/HBV DNA+). Occult hepatitis B infection in community-based populations has been scarcely investigated, and OBI outcomes remain unclear, especially in Wuwei, a region located in Northwest China. This region is one of the areas in China that has the highest prevalence of chronic HBV infection. A prospective study was performed in the general population of 2 towns of Wuwei from June 2011 to May 2014. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic and medical data, and serum samples were collected from the participants and stored until analysis. DNA was detected using quantitative PCR (qPCR) or nested PCR, the HBV DNA from HBV DNA-positive or possible positive (below the detection limit) subjects was extracted and amplified by nested PCR, and the PCR products were sequenced. Sequence analysis was performed using the Mega 6.0 program and CLC sequence viewer software. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in 90 of 3,080 HBsAg-negative subjects, and the prevalence of OBI in the study population was 2.92% (90/3,080, 95% CI: 2.33%-3.51%). Hepatitis B virus genomes in 51 of 80 objects (63.75%) contained mutations in the ""a"" determinant of HBsAg. After 2 years follow-up, 42 of 90 HBV DNA of OBI subjects remained positive, and the natural clearance rate of OBI subjects was 53.3%. Occult hepatitis B infection prevalence in this cohort was much lower than chronic HBV infection in the same region. HBV DNA was cleared in most OBI subjects during the 2 year period. Our data suggest that some OBI may represent a late stage of resolving the HBV infection process."
8670,0.005,1.0000,"Few studies have examined longitudinal changes in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). To more closely define the natural history of HIV-specific CTL, we used HLA-peptide tetrameric complexes to study the longitudinal CD8(+) T-cell response evolution in 16 A*0201-positive untreated individuals followed clinically for up to 14 years. As early as 1 to 2 years after seroconversion, we found a significant association between high frequencies of A*0201-restricted p17(Gag/Pol) tetramer-binding cells and slower disease progression (P < 0.01). We observed that responses could remain stable over many months, but any longitudinal changes that occurred were typically accompanied by reciprocal changes in RNA viral load. Phenotypic analysis with markers CD45RO, CD45RA, and CD27 identified distinct subsets of antigen-specific cells and the preferential loss of CD27(+) CD45RO(+) cells during periods of rapid decline in the frequency of tetramer-binding cells. In addition we were unable to confirm previous studies showing a consistent selective loss of HIV-specific cells in the context of sustained Epstein-Barr virus-specific cell frequencies. Overall, these data support a role of HIV-specific CTL in the control of disease progression and suggest that the ultimate loss of such CTL may be preferentially from the CD27(+) CD45RO(+) subset."
10876,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related glomerular disease is a cause of end-stage renal disease, though there is no recent data from Brazil concerning this syndrome. Persistent proteinuria (PPt) is the main marker for glomerular disease, especially levels above 1.5 g. We examined the prevalence of and associated risk factors for PPt, along with the prevalence of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) among AIDS patients. We interviewed 411 patients who were attended at the HIV/AIDS section of the Clinical Hospital of the Federal University of Pernambuco (Brazil) from January through June 2004. PPt was defined as a positive urine dipstick exam on at least two occasions. The analyzed risk factors were: black race, a low CD4 lymphocyte count (<200 cells/mm(3)), an HIV RNA level of >100,000 copies/mL and patients on highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The patients were classified according to urinary protein/creatinine ratio (Up/Uc) < 1.0, 1.0-3.0 and > 3.0. Patients with Up/Uc >3.0 were submitted to renal biopsy. Among the 411 HIV/AIDS patients, the mean age was 37 years, 70% were male, 37.5% were black, the mean CD4 count was 363 cells/mm(3) (+/- 95), the mean RNA HIV count was 44,475 copies/mL (+/- 40,369), and 92% were on HAART. The prevalence of PPt was 5.6% (95% CI = 3.6 to 8.3%), and it was significantly associated with a low CD4 lymphocyte count (p<0.048). HIVAN was found in just one patient, and two patients improved after HAART."
10870,0.005,1.0000,"Many human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons receive prolonged treatment with DNA-reactive antiretroviral drugs. A prospective study was conducted of 26 HIV-infected men who provided samples before treatment and at multiple times after beginning treatment, to investigate effects of antiretrovirals on lymphocyte and sperm chromosomes and semen quality. Several antiretroviral regimens, all including a nucleoside component, were used. Lymphocyte metaphase analysis and sperm fluorescence in situ hybridization were used for cytogenetic studies. Semen analyses included conventional parameters (volume, concentration, viability, motility, and morphology). No significant effects on cytogenetic parameters, semen volume, or sperm concentration were detected. However, there were significant improvements in sperm motility for men with study entry CD4 cell counts >200 cells/mm(3), sperm morphology for men with entry CD4 cell counts < or =200 cells/mm(3), and the percentage of viable sperm in both groups. These findings suggest that nucleoside-containing antiretrovirals administered via recommended protocols do not induce chromosomal changes in lymphocytes or sperm but may produce improvements in semen quality."
11740,0.005,1.0000,"This study examined baseline gender differences among HIV-positive methadone maintenance outpatients currently prescribed antiretroviral medications. Participants were enrolled in a larger clinical trial, which included a 4-week observation period using electronic monitors to track medication adherence. Contrary to previous literature, no significant differences were detected between men (n = 42) and women (n = 36) on medication adherence or depression. Both groups showed remarkably poor adherence during baseline (M = 56% of doses taken on time), high overall prevalence of depression (47%) and illicit cocaine use (47%). Women reported significantly more medication side effects (M = 21.4 vs. 14.9), higher severity of ASI psychiatric problems (M = 0.50 vs. 0.40), and lower SF-36 health-related quality of life in physical (M = 42.1 vs. 63.3) and emotional functioning (M = 26.9 vs. 58.9) than men. Women tested positive for opioids at higher rates than men (53% vs. 29%, respectively), whereas men were more likely to be positive for benzodiazepines than women (26% vs. 6%, respectively). Findings suggest that gender differences between male and female methadone maintenance patients have relevance to treatment providers. Extensive assessment, specialized medical care and mental health services may be warranted in the treatment of HIV-positive female drug abusers."
4073,0.005,1.0000,"In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection on sperm quality and the outcome of assisted reproductive technology (ART). A total of 916 men (457 HBV-positive and 459 HBV-negative) seeking fertility assistance from January 2008 to December 2009 at the Women's Hospital in the School of Medicine at Zhejiang University were analysed for semen parameters. Couples in which the men were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-seropositive were categorized as HBV-positive and included 587 in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and 325 intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles from January 2004 to December 2009; negative controls were matched for female age, date of ova retrieval, ART approach used (IVF or ICSI) and randomized in a ratio of 1:1 according to the ART treatment cycles (587 for IVF and 325 for ICSI). HBV-infected men exhibited lower semen volume, lower total sperm count as well as poor sperm motility and morphology (P < 0.05) when compared to control individuals. Rates of two-pronuclear (2PN) fertilisation, high-grade embryo acquisition, implantation and clinical pregnancy were also lower among HBV-positive patients compared to those of HBV-negative patients after ICSI and embryo transfer (P < 0.05); IVF outcomes were similar between the two groups (P > 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that HBV infection independently contributed to increased rates of asthenozoospermia and oligozoospermia/azoospermia (P < 0.05) as well as decreased rates of implantation and clinical pregnancy in ICSI cycles (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that HBV infection in men is associated with poor sperm quality and worse ICSI and embryo transfer outcomes but does not affect the outcome of IVF and embryo transfer."
4462,0.005,1.0000,"Several studies of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 have suggested that women have lower plasma HIV-1 RNA levels than men, even when controlling for CD4 T cell levels. A cross-sectional analysis was performed in 494 patients (21% of whom were women) who enrolled in a prospective study of anemic HIV-1-infected patients requiring transfusion. The median CD4 T cell count and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were 15 cells/microL and 4.83 log(10) copies/mL (67,350 copies/mL), respectively. In unadjusted analyses, women had slightly higher mean log HIV-1 RNA titers than men (0.19 log(10) higher copies/mL; 95% confidence interval, -0.05 to 0.44; P=.11). Adjustment for CD4 T cell count, race or ethnicity, injection drug use, and age yielded a smaller sex difference (0.13 log(10) copies/mL higher in women; P=.28). In this population of patients with very advanced HIV disease, there is no evidence that women have lower HIV-1 RNA levels than men."
12493,0.005,1.0000,"Changes in IgG levels and patterns in association with human immunodeficiency virus, (HIV) infection were characterized in a prospective investigation by studying serum electrophoresis and antibodies to HIV at least once a year in 144 homo/bisexual (HS) men during a 4-year period. Initially, 25 men (17.4%) were HIV-positive, and this increased to 44 at the end of the study period. HIV-negative men had IgG levels of 11.2 +/- 2.2 g/l. In the 19 HIV seroconverters the mean IgG level rose with time according to the equation IgG = 0.054x + 12.56 (x = months after the last HIV-negative test). Oligoclonal IgG bands were found in three of the 19 seroconverters (16%) prior to conversion and in 2/16 (13%), 5/13 (38%), 7/11 (64%), and 3/8 (38%) 1, 2, 3, and 4 years after conversion, respectively. Of the 25 initially HIV-positive men, five have developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) during the 4.5 year follow-up. At the first investigation these five men had higher mean IgG levels (16.0 +/- 2.7 g/l) than the 20 men who have remained healthy (14.6 +/- 2.8 g/l), and all five had oligoclonal bands as compared to 9/20 of those who did not develop AIDS. Oligoclonal IgG bands reflect the IgG increase and seem to indicate long-standing HIV infection and a poor prognosis."
6089,0.005,1.0000,"Very few studies have documented relations between personality traits and quality of life among individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Some have shown that poor perceived quality of life as determined by a sense of purpose may be associated with inadequate adherence to highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) in this population. Although adequate HAART adherence is critical to achieve the full therapeutic effects of newly and highly effective regimens, very little is known of how both personality factors and HIV-specific quality of life may impact adherence to these medication regimens. This study evaluated relations among personality traits, quality of life and HAART adherence among 116 men and women living with HIV/AIDS. Results showed that personality traits such as neuroticism were significantly associated with poorer quality of life, whereas conscientiousness and extraversion were associated with better quality of life. In contrast, personality traits were not directly related to HAART adherence. Both higher overall functioning and lower medication worries scores were significantly associated with HAART adherence. Findings suggest that personality traits are associated with HIV-specific quality of life on the one hand, and that HIV-specific quality of life is related to HAART adherence on the other. Future studies assessing the efficacy of psychosocial interventions in improving quality of life and HAART adherence should consider the role of personality traits in promoting better quality of life."
4966,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the role of host susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, we studied subsequent seroconversion in 161 individuals, initially seronegative to HIV-1, who underwent skin testing for cutaneous anergy at an index visit within a prospective study of homosexual men. There were 23 seroconversions in these men by 45 months following the skin testing, yielding a crude rate of seroconversion of 14.3%. While results of purified protein derivative (PPD), Candida, and Trichophyton skin tests were not associated with subsequent course, anergy to dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) was predictive of subsequent seroconversion. Kaplan-Meier estimates for the risk of seroconversion during 45 months of follow-up in those men initially anergic and reactive to DNCB were 28.9 and 11.1%, respectively, yielding a relative risk of 2.6 (p = 0.006). The estimated relative risk was stable with adjustment by Cox regression for annual number of male sexual partners and frequency of receptive anal intercourse, and was not sensitive to various changes in the definition of seroconversion time and of eligibility criteria. These data suggest that an impaired host immune status may be associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 infection that is independent of risk of exposure to the virus, supporting earlier speculations that HIV-1 may itself be opportunistic. The notion of varying host susceptibility to infection, at least with regard to sexual transmission in homosexual men, may help to explain the frequent observation of individuals who have been repeatedly exposed to the virus and yet have remained uninfected."
19726,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of the current study was to evaluate a clinical program that used multisystemic therapy (MST) to improve regimen adherence and health outcomes among children with perinatally acquired HIV who exhibited high viral loads in the absence of viral resistance. MST is an intensive, home-based family therapy previously used for the treatment of serious antisocial behavior. Goals of the study were to assess the feasibility of the MST program and its effectiveness for improving health outcomes among children who were treated. The study was conducted by retrospective chart review. Ninety percent of children and families referred to the program accepted the referral and 95% received a full dose of treatment, suggesting high program feasibility. Nineteen children participated in the program. General HIV knowledge on the part of caregivers improved significantly over the course of treatment. Although caregiver-reported adherence did not change, viral loads were found to significantly decrease from referral to the end of MST treatment, with the mean change reflecting a greater than 1 log10 decrease. The majority of children maintained these improvements during the 3 months after treatment termination. Results suggest that MST holds promise as an intervention for improving health outcomes among pediatric patients with HIV."
19205,0.005,1.0000,"Complex drug-drug interactions have been reported with concurrent administration of telaprevir (TVR) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors (PIs), leading to relevant limitations of the therapeutic options for patients coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV. However, little is known about the pharmacokinetics and drug interactions between TVR and antiretrovirals in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with advanced liver fibrosis. Here we report the pharmacokinetics of TVR and antiretrovirals in a cohort of HIV/HCV genotype 1-coinfected patients with advanced liver fibrosis treated with TVR-based triple anti-HCV therapy. No significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir, amprenavir or tenofovir at baseline and at Day 15 of TVR, whereas the AUC0-4h of darunavir was 36% lower in the presence of TVR (AUC0-4h 15007ngh/mL and 9563ngh/mL at baseline and at Day 15 of TVR administration, respectively). Noteworthy, the AUC0-4h, Cmin and Cmax of raltegravir were reduced by 61%, 50% and 64%, respectively. However, none of the patient's plasma levels of tenofovir, atazanavir, amprenavir or raltegravir declined below their minimum effective concentrations even in association with TVR, and no HIV treatment failure occurred. A non-significant trend for lower TVR exposure was seen in patients concomitantly given amprenavir versus those given atazanavir (AUC0-4h, 9840ngh/mL and 13345ngh/mL, respectively). In conclusion, this study highlighted the feasibility of maintaining the current antiretroviral regimen in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, even when significant interactions with TVR are predictable, whenever a change of HIV PIs is not deemed appropriate.

18768,0.005,1.0000,"Adolescents are a vulnerable population, not only to the acquisition of HIV, but also to poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) associated with disease progression and a increased risk of onward viral transmission. The aim of the study was to examine the factors that aid or act as barriers to adherence in a UK population of adolescents and young adults receiving ART. A cross-sectional survey was completed of 138 adolescents (12-24 years) across 14 clinical and community sites in the UK and Ireland. Analysis of results was undertaken using Chi-square testing in SPSS. Of the 138 patients, 48% were female, and 52% were born outside of the UK. Fifty-two of the 138 (43%) reported being on ART for at least 8 years. More than a third of the patients have ever interrupted treatment since initiating ART. One hundred four of the 138 (75%) patients self-reported being >85% adherent to medication for 7 day recall. Self-motivation (e.g., having a routine, specific goal) was cited as being most helpful in medication compliance (33%), followed by reminders by friends and family (25%), with 20% identifing no specific factor. Only 15% chose interventions such as an adherence diary or mobile phone reminders as helpful factors, and 1% chose healthcare professional input such as home visits. This study highlights the importance of self-motivation and social support in medication adherence in an HIV-infected adolescent population, in preference to healthcare professional input. Education and motivational strategies may confer the biggest impact on sustained ART adherence amongst this vulnerable group. "
12208,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in children is complicated may be because of many factors such as child characteristics, caregiver and family characteristics, regimen characteristics, etc. Therefore, it is important to identify factors associated with adherence in HIV infected children in order to reduce the risk of developing treatment failure or drug resistance through interventions. This survey was planned to find out the rate of adherence to ART and its associated factors among the children in Mekelle, Tigray region, Ethiopia."

Opioid substitution therapy, the standard treatment for opioid dependence, provides an excellent opportunity for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection due to the close and regular contact between patients and clinicians. However, there is little research on the impact of opioid substitution therapy on the prevalence of the hepatitis C virus at a national level. This paper describes the protocol for the Epidemiology of Hepatitis C Virus Infection among People Receiving Opioid Substitution Therapy (ECHO) study. The aim of this study is to estimate the national prevalence and incidence of hepatitis C virus infection among people receiving opioid substitution therapy in Germany and to describe factors associated with hepatitis C treatment uptake and seroconversion."
7532,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in naïve patients has been previously shown to differ greatly with the geographic origin. The purpose of this study was to prospectively estimate the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance in Greece by analyzing a representative sample of newly HIV-1 diagnosed patients, as part of the SPREAD collaborative study. Protease (PR) and partial reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences were determined from 101 newly diagnosed HIV-1 patients, in Greece, during the period September 2002--August 2003, representing one-third of the total newly diagnosed HIV-1 patients in the same time period. The prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance was estimated according to the IAS-USA mutation table taking into account all mutations in RT and only major mutations in PR region. The overall prevalence of resistance was 9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.2--16.2%]. The prevalence of mutations associated with resistance to NRTIs was 5% (95% CI: 1.6--11.2%), for NNRTIs was 4% (95% CI: 1.1--9.8%), while no major resistance mutations were found in PR. No multi-class resistance was detected in the study population. The prevalence of resistant mutations in the recent seroconverters was 22%. For two individuals, there was clear evidence for transmitted resistance based on epidemiological information for a known source of HIV-1 transmission. The prevalence of the HIV-1 non-B subtypes and recombinants was 52%."
6258,0.005,1.0000,"In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that people who contracted HIV from ""blameless"" routes (e.g., blood transfusion, sex with stable partners) are less stigmatized compared to people who contracted HIV from ""blamable"" routes (e.g., injection drug use, sex with sex workers). A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2,987 participants in Guangxi province, China, between 2012 and 2013. We employed both explanatory and predictive modeling strategy by using multivariate linear regression models. In the explanatory models, we assessed the association between routes of infection and three types of stigma (perceived, internalized, and enacted). From identified routes of infection that significantly contributed to higher stigma, we employed predictive modeling to explore predictors for the specific type of stigma. Multiple-imputation was employed for sensitivity analyses. Of the total sample, 63% were male and the average age was 42.9 years (ranged between 18 and 88). Multivariate regression models revealed that contraction from commercial sex increased the perceived (β = 0.46, 95%CI = 0.02, 0.90) and internalized stigma (β = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.09, 1.10), while injecting drug use increased the perceived (β = 0.65, 95%CI = 0.07, 1.22) and enacted stigma (β = 0.09, 95%CI = 0.02, 0.16) after controlling for confounders. Among PLWHA who were infected via commercial sex partners, social support was negatively associated with perceived (β = -0.47, 95%CI = -0.79, -0.14) and internalized stigma (β = -0.80, 95%CI = -1.24, -0.35). Among PLWHA who were infected via injecting drugs, no adherence to antiretroviral treatment (β = 0.41, 95%CI = 0.01, 0.82) was positively associated with perceived stigma, and disclosure of serostatus to others was negatively associated with enacted stigma (β = -0.20, 95%CI = -0.34, -0.05). Knowledge of the association between routes of infection and stigma can guide health professionals and policy makers to develop tailored intervention strategies to mitigate the effects of stigma and enhance HIV care utilization among PLWHA in China.

13885,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of the present study was to investigate the association between human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) infection and cancer risk in a longitudinal study. The study population consisted of 2729 atomic bomb survivors in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, who had no previous history of cancer at baseline. The baseline survey, including analysis of antibody to HTLV-1, took place during 1985-1987 and follow-up was performed until the end of 2001. There were 553 incident cases of malignant neoplasms during the observation period. After adjustment for sex, age and other variables, HTLV-1 infection was not associated with the risk of developing cancers of all sites, excluding adult T-cell leukemia (rate ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.4), stomach, colon and rectum, lung, female breast or other minor sites, but was associated with increased risk of liver cancer (rate ratio 2.1, 95%CI 1.0-4.6). The point estimate of the rate ratio for thyroid cancer was 3.0, but this was not significantly higher than 1 because of the small number of events (n = 11) and low prevalence of HTLV-1 seropositivity. These findings support the idea that HTLV-1 infection is not associated with an increased general cancer risk. Confounding by hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the interaction between HTLV-1 and HCV may explain the increased risk of liver cancer among HTLV-1 carriers. Further follow-up may be required to determine if HTLV-1 carriers are at increased risk of thyroid cancer."
14460,0.005,1.0000,"In Jamaica, where homosexuality is criminalized, scant research has examined associations between sexual stigma and HIV infection. The study objective was to examine correlates of HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Jamaica. We conducted a cross-sectional tablet-based survey with MSM in Jamaica using chain referral sampling. We assessed socio-demographic, individual, social, and structural factors associated with HIV infection. A logit-link model, fit using backwards-stepwise regression, was used to estimate a final multivariable model. Among 498 participants (median age: 24, interquartile range: 22-28), 67 (13.5%) were HIV-positive. In the multivariable model, HIV infection was associated with increased odds of socio-demographic (older age, odds ratio [OR]: 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.10]; residing in Kingston versus Ocho Rios [OR: 6.99, 95% CI 2.54-19.26]), individual (poor/fair versus excellent/good self-rated health [OR: 4.55, 95% CI: 1.81-11.42], sexually transmitted infection [STI] history [OR: 3.67, 95% CI: 1.61-8.38]), and structural (enacted sexual stigma [OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01-1.15], having a health care provider [OR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.06-4.66]) factors. This is among the first studies to demonstrate associations between sexual stigma and HIV infection in Jamaica. Findings underscore the need to integrate STI testing in the HIV care continuum and to address stigma and regional differences among MSM in Jamaica."
5780,0.005,1.0000,"This study describes how hospital-at-home care (HHC) use by persons with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (PWA) has changed since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). For this study, all adult PWA (877) admitted for the first time to the HHC program, established for PWAs in the metropolitan area of Rome, between January 1994 and December 1998, were enrolled. Temporal changes in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated. For subjects who concluded their first HHC cycle (851/877), the reasons for ending the service were assessed over time. From 1994 to 1998, the proportion of patients admitted to HHC of those living with AIDS in the Rome area decreased significantly (from 15.1% to 7.5%), while the median CD4+ cell count at HHC entry increased significantly. The proportion of patients referred to outpatient services at the end of their cycle of HHC increased sevenfold from 1994 to 1998, with a steep increase between 1996 and 1997. In multivariate analysis, only the use of triple-combination ART was significantly associated with referral to outpatient care (odds ratio [OR] = 4.26; 95%, confidence interval [CI] = 1.94-9.34). The results suggest that HHC use by PWAs in the ART era has diminished, while the HHC use pattern has also changed: there is a growing tendency to provide care to patients with less advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, prior to the beneficial effects of drugs, and the consequent referral to outpatient care."
3567,0.005,1.0000,"Clinical trials have shown that the prophylactic use of zidovudine and aerosolized pentamidine (or other antibiotics used as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-free human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons delays the development of AIDS, but the effectiveness of such therapy in general use in the population still remains largely undocumented. To help answer this question, the authors estimate the effectiveness of this therapy in a population-based cohort of HIV-infected homosexual and bisexual men in San Francisco. The authors use a continuous-time Markov process to model the decline of CD4+ T-lymphocytes (T4-cells) measured in cells/microliter in HIV-infected persons. The model partitions the HIV (type 1) infection period into six progressive T4-cell count intervals (stages), followed by a seventh stage: AIDS diagnosis. The authors use maximum likelihood methods to fit the model to the observed transitions for 428 HIV-infected men during June 1984 to March 1991, from the San Francisco Men's Health Study. Since zidovudine was not widely used before 1988, the model has a component that controls for calendar time-related biases. The fitted model provides statistical estimates and confidence intervals for measuring therapy effectiveness. The authors estimate that prophylactic therapy reduces the progression rate from stage 4 (T4-cell count, 350-499) to stage 5 (T4-cell count, 200-349) by a factor of 0.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.22 to 0.55); from stage 5 to stage 6 (T4-cell count < 200) by a factor of 0.33 (95% CI 0.04-0.54); and from stage 6 to 7 (AIDS) by a factor of 0.62 (95% CI 0.47-0.73). In addition, therapy started by an HIV-infected person in stage 4 is estimated to reduce the risk of developing AIDS by a factor of 0.83 (95% CI 0.46-0.94) at 6 months and 0.68 (95% CI 0.35-0.89) at 24 months after entering stage 4. Therapy started by HIV-infected persons in more advanced stages is estimated to reduce the risk of developing AIDS by factors ranging from 0.70 (95% CI 0.39-0.90), early in stage 5, to 0.28 (95% CI 0.14-0.45), late in stage 6. Thus, the prophylactic use of zidovudine and pentamidine in routine medical care has a strong, consistent, and significant effect in slowing the clinical course of HIV infection in a population-based cohort."
9749,0.005,1.0000,"Intrauterine hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been suggested to be caused by transplacental transmission that cannot be blocked by hepatitis B vaccine. This would decrease the effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccine. This study examined the risk factors and mechanism of transplacental HBV transmission. A case-control study included 402 newborn infants from 402 HBsAg-positive pregnant women. Among these, 15 newborn infants infected with HBV by intrauterine transmission were selected as cases, and the rest as controls. A pathology study included 101 full-term placentas from the HBsAg-positive pregnant women above and 14 from HBsAg-negative pregnant women. Immunohistochemistry staining and HBV DNA in situ hybridization were used to estimate the association of intrauterine HBV infection and HBV infection in the placentas. HBeAg positivity in mothers' sera (OR = 17.07, 95%CI 3.39-86.01) and threatened preterm labor (OR = 5.44, 95%CI 1.15-25.67) were found to be associated with transplacental HBV transmission. The intrauterine infection rate increased linearly and significantly with maternal serum HBsAg titers (trend test P = 0.0117) and HBV DNA concentration (trend test P < 0.01). Results of the pathology study showed that HBV infection rates decreased gradually from the maternal side to the fetal side (trend test P = 0.0009) in the placental cell layers. There was a significant association between intrauterine HBV transmission and HBV infection in villous capillary endothelial cells (VCEC) in the placenta (OR = 18.46, P = 0.0002). The main risk factors for intrauterine HBV infection are maternal serum HBeAg positivity, history of threatened preterm labor, and HBV in the placenta especially the villous capillary endothelial cells. Previous reports of transplacental leakage of maternal blood causing intrauterine infection are confirmed. In addition, there appears to be a ""cellular transfer"" of HBV from cell to cell in the placenta causing intrauterine infection. This latter hypothesis needs to be confirmed."
13610,0.005,1.0000,"Owing to antiretroviral drug-induced endothelial dysfunction, HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) may have elevated blood pressure. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effects of ART on blood pressure levels and hypertension risk among HIV-infected populations worldwide. We sought articles that compared the mean blood pressure measurements and hypertension prevalence between HIV-infected adults naive and exposed to ART. Thirty-nine studies comprising 44 903 participants met the inclusion criteria. Overall, systolic (mean difference (MD) 4.52 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.65-6.39, I(2)=68.1%, 19 studies) and diastolic blood pressure levels (MD 3.17 mm Hg, 95% CI 1.71-4.64, I(2)=72.5%, 16 studies) were significantly higher among ART-exposed patients compared with treatment-naive patients. Similarly, the risk of hypertension was significantly higher among ART-exposed patients, such that among 28 908 ART-exposed patients, 4195 (14.5%) had hypertension compared with 950 of 9086 (10.5%) in those who were treatment-naive (odds ratio 1.68, 95% CI 1.35-2.10, I(2)=81.5%, 32 studies). In summary, exposure to ART is significantly associated with increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, and increased risk of hypertension, regardless of study-level sociodemographic differences. This meta-analysis supports the need for population-based strategies to reduce the risk of high blood pressure among people living with HIV on ART."
18600,0.005,1.0000,"The present study evaluated the in vitro response to different mitogens and a candidin antigen (CMA) in Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and co-infected HIV-1/HTLV-1 patients, to identify if this co-infection may modify the spontaneous lymph proliferative response. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 72 healthy seronegative controls, 75 asymptomatic HTLV-1-infected carriers, 42 HAM/TSP cases, 33 solely HIV-1-infected subjects and 24 HIV-1/HTLV-1 patients were assayed in the presence and absence of mitogens (PHA, PWM and OKT3) and CMA. The HAM/TSP group had the highest proliferation rate at 3 and 6 days after culture. HAM/TSP cases showed decreased response to PHA, compared with asymptomatic HTLV-1 subjects, and most important, the co-infected HIV-1/HTLV-1 cases presented a similar response to HTLV-1-infected subjects after 3 days of culture. The singles HIV-1-infected group had decreased in vitro response. It appears that during co-infection, the HTLV-1 regulatory proteins overwhelm the action of HIV-1 regulatory proteins."
3164,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection with isoniazid can cause hepatotoxicity, but the risk of isoniazid-associated hepatotoxicity among persons coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is unknown. We conducted a prospective study among 146 injection drug users with M. tuberculosis infection and normal baseline hepatic transaminase values who were treated with isoniazid. Of 146 participants, 138 (95%) were HCV-seropositive. Thirty-seven participants (25%) were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive. Thirty-two (22%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 16%-30%) of 146 participants developed transaminase value elevations to >3 times the upper limit of normal. Transaminase value elevation was associated with concurrent alcohol use but not with race, age, presence of hepatitis B surface antigen, HIV-1 infection, or current injection drug use. Isoniazid was withdrawn from 11 participants (8%; 95% CI, 4%-13%). Of 8 deaths during follow-up, none were attributed to isoniazid-associated hepatotoxicity. The risk of transaminase value elevation and drug discontinuation for HCV-infected persons receiving isoniazid was within the range reported for populations with lower HCV prevalence."
4509,0.005,1.0000,"The presence of an association between chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and fatty liver is controversial. We examined the association between HBV infection and the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We conducted a cohort study of 83,339 participants without NAFLD at baseline who underwent serologic testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) between 2002 and 2006 and were followed annually or biennially until December 2014. NAFLD was defined as the presence of ultrasonographic fatty liver in the absence of excessive alcohol use or other identifiable causes. We used a parametric Cox model to estimate adjusted hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals of incident NAFLD. During 484,736.1 person-years of follow-up, 20,200 incident NAFLD cases were identified. In models adjusted for age, sex, year of visit, smoking status, alcohol intake, regular exercise, education level, and body mass index, the adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for incident NAFLD comparing HBsAg-positive to HBsAg-negative participants was 0.83 (0.73-0.94). After introducing HBV infection and confounders (including homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and metabolic factors) as time-dependent exposures, the association between HBV infection and decreased risk of incident NAFLD was attenuated but persisted. These associations were consistently observed across clinically relevant, prespecified subgroups."
951,0.005,1.0000,"Patients with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) experience multiple signs and symptoms that accompany the progress of HIV-related diseases. HIV-related symptoms are associated with side effects and HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) complications. The purposes of this study were to estimate the frequency and intensity of HIV-related signs and symptoms in patients with HIV infection and to explore relationships between HIV-related symptoms and the HAART regimen. Data on a total of 172 HIV-positive patients enrolled in an HIV case management program were analyzed for this study. Participants experienced an average of 9.73+/-7.27 symptoms, with fatigue, dry mouth and weakness the most frequently reported. Average mean symptom intensity among participants was 13.24+/-11.48. Insomnia, depression and disorientation were the most severe symptoms. No differences were recorded between HIV-related symptoms and disease progression. Fatigue intensity showed significant differences between NRTI (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), +NNRTI (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) and NRTI+PI (protease inhibitors) based regimens (p=.03). In addition, cluster symptoms of confusion/distress among participants without HAART had a significantly higher mean intensity than those with HAART (t=2.0, df=1, p=.04). Our study indicated that symptom management for fatigue and early detection of psychological distress is needed to improve quality of life for people living with HIV/AIDS."
4353,0.005,1.0000,"In newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), standard lymphoma regimens yield approximately a 50% complete response (CR) rate and an overall median survival of < or = 9 months. Treatment results of relapsed patients are extremely poor. Regimens that appear more effective than standard therapy have usually been investigated only in patients with relatively high CD4 counts. An exception is a regimen consisting of a continuous 96-hour infusion of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (CDE). A 62% CR rate was achieved in 21 patients with a median CD4 count of 87/microL, and the median overall survival was 18 months. In another study of 25 patients, didanosine (ddI) was added to CDE and was shown to cause less myelosuppression without compromising efficacy. Other studies suggest that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can be combined with intensive chemotherapy regimens, with improved efficacy attributed to less frequent dosage reduction of chemotherapeutic agents. More recently, autologous and syngeneic bone marrow transplantation have been explored in a handful of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related NHL with promising results. Data on whether widespread use of HAART decreases the incidence of HIV-positive NHL are conflicting. Some clues from recent studies suggest we are close to an answer: (1) protease inhibitors significantly improve survival of HIV-positive patients with NHL; (2) only one of eight recent cases of HIV-positive men with NHL received HAART compared with greater than 70% of HIV-positive men free of NHL; and (3) no prior HAART independently predicted for AIDS-related NHL development. On the other hand, Hodgkin's disease may be increasing in frequency in HIV-positive patients as the incidence of NHL declines. It is hypothesized that more effective reconstitution of the immune system with HAART may facilitate the inversion of these incidences. Future prospective studies will hopefully answer these questions."
1764,0.005,1.0000,"Medical records of 341 patients with syphilis seen at a health department sexually transmitted disease clinic were reviewed to assess membership in high-risk subgroups and interactions with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. When compared with the entire clinic population, patients with syphilis tended to be older and were more likely to acknowledge intravenous drug use, more often had a history of syphilis, and, among men, were more often homosexually active. Half of the men with syphilis and one third of the women fell into one or more of these high-risk subgroups. Patients with syphilis were also more likely to test positive for HIV infection than other patients attending the clinic. Patients admitting to intravenous drug use, prior syphilis, or being homosexually active were significantly more likely to be HIV seropositive than patients without these characteristics, even though patients with these characteristics were significantly more likely to refuse HIV serologic testing. Although clinical stage of syphilis at presentation did not differ when patients with and without concurrent HIV infection were compared, geometric mean rapid plasma reagin titers were significantly higher in HIV-infected patients with secondary syphilis."
2998,0.005,1.0000,"Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and the subsequent increased life expectancy in HIV-infected persons, non-HIV-related diseases have become an important cause of morbidity and mortality. This cross-sectional study reports the prevalence of overweight and obesity, and sociodemographic, psychological, and substance use-related risk factors for elevated body mass index (BMI) among 2157 HIV-seropositive (HIV+) in comparison to 730 HIV-seronegative (HIV-) participants in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). Separate univariable and multivariate linear regression analyses were completed for HIV+ and HIV- women. Our study revealed a similar proportion of obesity (body mass index [BMI] >or=30) among HIV+ (33%) and HIV- women (29%) (p = 0.12), as well as comparable median BMI (HIV+: 26.1 versus HIV-: 26.7, p = 0.16). HIV+ compared to HIV- women, respectively, were significantly (p < 0.01) older (median = 35.6 versus. 32.5), but similar (p = 0.97) by race/ethnicity (57% African American, 28% Hispanic, and 15% white for both). In multivariate models for both HIV+ and HIV- women, African American race/ethnicity was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with higher BMI, while higher quality of life score and illicit hard drug use were associated with lower BMI. Additionally, smoking, alcohol use, markers of advanced HIV infection (AIDS diagnosis, elevated HIV viral load, low CD4 count), and a history of antiretroviral therapy use (ART) were also associated with lower BMI among HIV+ women. In conclusion, risk factors for elevated BMI were similar for HIV+ and HIV- women in the WIHS. For HIV+ women, all markers of advanced HIV infection and ART use were additionally associated with lower BMI."
2512,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated the changes in the progression to death and AIDS and in the mean level of CD4 lymphocytes by calendar period in HIV-positive individuals before and after the introduction of HAART. Through data collected in a prospective cohort study (Italian Seroconversion Study) of 1899 HIV-infected persons with well estimated date of seroconversion, considered as time-zero of analysis, we calculated Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models, allowing for staggered entries, to estimate the cumulative probability of survival and hazard-ratios (HR) for death and for AIDS by calendar period (1980-1996: pre-HAART era, 1997-1998: first HAART era, and 1999-2001: second HAART era), age at seroconversion, gender, and exposure category. During 17251 person-years, 660 HIV-positive patients developed AIDS and 510 died. Before 1997, the cumulative probability of survival, at twelve years from seroconversion, was 51.0%. In the period 1997-1998 the probability was 77.3% and in the period 1999-2001 it further increased at 91.2%. In the period 1980-1996 only older age at seroconversion was associated with more rapid progression to death. In the period 1987-2001 individuals infected through injecting drug use had a reduced increase of survival compared to those infected through sexual contact. Similar results were obtained for progression to AIDS. Finally we estimated an improved level of immunesuppression in the period 1987-2001. In fact, while in the period 1980-1996 we estimated a decrease of the CD4 lymphocites of -54.8 cells/mm3 (95% CI: -52.0; -57.6) per year; after 1996, we estimated an increase of CD4 of +39.6 (95% CI +34.1; +45.1)per year. This study provides strong evidence that the efficacy of the HAART estimated in the controlled clinical trials has resulted in a real reduction at the population level of morbidity and mortality."
6994,0.005,1.0000,"Before the mid-1980s, haemophilia often was unknowingly treated with contaminated plasma products, resulting in high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. To estimate the impact of these infections, a new cohort was established. All HCV-seropositive patients, age 13-88 years, at 52 comprehensive haemophilia treatment centres were eligible. Cross-sectional data collected during April 2001 to January 2004 (median June 2002) were analysed. Plasma HIV-1 and HCV RNA were quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was defined as use of at least three recommended medications. Among 2069 participants, 620 (30%) had HIV-1. Of 1955 with known HBV status, 814 (42%) had resolved HBV and 90 (4.6%) were HBV carriers. Although 80% of the HIV-1-positive participants had > or = 200 CD4+ cells microL(-1), only 59% were on HAART. HIV-1 RNA was undetectable in 23% of those not taking antiretroviral medications. Most (72%) participants had received no anti-HCV therapy. HCV RNA was detected less frequently (59%) among participants treated with standard interferon plus ribavirin (P = 0.0001) and more frequently among HIV-1-positive than HIV-1-negative participants (85% vs. 70%, P < 0.0001). HIV-1-positive participants were more likely to have pancytopenia and subclinical hepatic abnormalities, as well as persistent jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and ascites. HAART recipients did not differ from HIV-negative participants in the prevalence of ascites. The clinical abnormalities were more prevalent with older age but were not confounded by HBV status or self-reported alcohol consumption. Eleven participants presented with or previously had hepatocellular carcinoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although prospective analysis is needed, our data reveal the scale of hepatic and haematological disease that is likely to manifest in the adult haemophilic population during the coming years unless most of them are successfully treated for HIV-1, HCV or both."
3666,0.005,1.0000,"This study sought to develop an effective and reliable nomogram for predictions of recurrence for postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (PA-TACE) in patients with hepatitis B virus-related (HBV) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The nomogram was established based on data obtained from a retrospective study on 235 consecutive patients with HBV HCC who received PA-TACE as an initial therapy from 2006 to 2010 in our center. Eighty-four patients who were collected at another institution between 01/2008 and 12/2010 served as an external validation set. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was collected. The nomogram for tumor recurrence was developed based on the data obtained before the PA-TACE procedure. Predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of the nomogram were assessed by concordance index (C-index), calibration curves, and validation set.The 1, 2, 3-year RFS rates were 55.5%, 27.0%, and 14.1%, respectively, in the patients from the derivation set and 60.7%, 33.2%, and 23.8% in those from the validation set. Four risk factors (HBV-DNA level, vascular invasion, change of Child-Pugh score, and tumor diameter) in the multivariate analysis were significantly associated with RFS. The statistical nomogram incorporated these 4 factors achieved good calibration and discriminatory abilities with the c-index of 0.74 (95% CI 0.66-0.82). The findings were supported by the independent external validation set (c-index, 0.70; 95% CI 0.58-0.83). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in our model was greater than those of conventional staging systems in the validation patients (corresponding c-indices, 0.56-0.64).The novel nomogram may achieve an optimal prediction for recurrence outcome in HBV-related HCC with PA-TACE."
15875,0.005,1.0000,"This study identifies factors associated with high-risk sexual and drug injection behaviors among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected injection drug users (IDUs) after initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Participants of a large cohort study of IDUs in Baltimore were seen at semiannual visits; blood samples to determine HIV serostatus and CD4+ cell count were obtained, as well as questionnaire data on risk behaviors and medication. Survival analysis conducted for 190 HIV-infected participants who initiated HAART during 1996-2000 revealed that an increase in CD4+ cell count (categorized as an increase of >0 cells/mm3 or of < or =0 cells/mm3) after HAART initiation was independently associated with engaging in any sexual intercourse (adjusted relative hazard [ARH], 1.83; 95% CI, 1.22-2.73) and with a 3-fold increase in the hazard of engaging in unprotected sexual intercourse (ARH, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.57-6.93) after HAART initiation. An increase in CD4+ cell count after HAART initiation was not associated with injection of drugs or needle sharing. Risk reduction counseling remains important, despite improvements in the treatment of HIV infection."

In 2004, several patients with HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) initiated antiretroviral treatment (ART) at the Central Hospital of Liangshan Prefecture. From 2005 to 2013, the number of patients receiving ART dramatically increased.We conducted a retrospective cohort study to analyze the long-term survival time and associated factors among patients with HIV/AIDS who received ART in Liangshan Prefecture for the first time. Data were collected from the Chinese AIDS Antiretroviral Therapy DATAFax Information System. A life table and the Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportion hazard regression were used to calculate the survival time and its associated factors, respectively.Among 8310 ART-naïve patients with HIV/AIDS who initiated ART, 436 patients died of AIDS-related diseases, and their median time of receiving ART was 15.0 ± 12.3 months, whereas 28.7% of them died within the first 6 months after treatment. The cumulative survival rates of those receiving ART in 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years were 97.1%, 93.4%, 90.6%, 88.8%, and 86.0%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that male patients on ART were at a higher risk of death from AIDS-related diseases (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-2.1) than female patients. Patients infected with HIV through injection drug use (IDU) were at a higher risk of death (AHR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.2) than those infected through heterosexual transmission. Patients with a baseline CD4 cell count <50/mm (AHR = 9.8, 95% CI: 6.0-15.9), 50-199/mm (AHR = 3.3, 95% CI: 2.3-4.6), and 200-349/mm (AHR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2-2.3) were at a higher risk of death than those with a CD4 cell count ≥350/mm.ART prolonged survival time of patients with HIV/AIDS and improved their survival probability. Patients with HIV/AIDS should be consistently followed up and the CD4 T-cell count regularly monitored, and timely and early antiretroviral therapy initiated in order to achieve a better survival rate.

6944,0.005,1.0000,"A prospective study of 1,198 individuals who seroconverted to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was conducted to estimate the incidence and determinants of herpes zoster and to determine whether herpes zoster can accelerate the progression to AIDS. Herpes zoster was diagnosed for 48 individuals (4%). After adjusting for the CD4 cell count, individuals acquiring HIV infection through sexual contact were more likely to have herpes zoster than were injection drug users (relative hazard, 1.50). The crude relative hazard of AIDS for individuals who had herpes zoster compared with those without herpes zoster was 2.44; the adjusted relative hazard was 1.08. After adjusting for the CD4 cell count, fever was the only specific characteristic of herpes zoster that was significantly associated with a more rapid progression to AIDS (relative hazard, 6.52). Data suggest that herpes zoster occurs more frequently in individuals acquiring HIV infection through sexual transmission. There was no evidence that herpes zoster per se is an independent cofactor of progression of HIV disease, although febrile episodes of herpes zoster may predict a faster progression to AIDS."
16877,0.005,1.0000,"Despite association with adverse clinical outcome, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated malnutrition has been relatively refractory to conventional nutrition management. Consequently, a prospective randomized trial was conducted to evaluate a new peptide-based enteral formula (NEF) in contrast to a standard enteral formula (SEF) in patients with HIV infection. Eighty early-stage largely asymptomatic patients were randomized into a dietary regimen supplemented with either a ready-to-feed NEF (18.7% protein, 65.5% carbohydrate, 15.8% fat; 1.28 kcal/ml) or SEF (14% protein, 55% carbohydrate, 31% fat; 1.06 kcal/ml). Patients received 2-3 8-oz cans of the NEF or SEF supplement per day for 6 mo. Parameters evaluated at 0 (baseline), 3, and 6 mo included adherence, weight change, anthropometric measurements, serum biochemical indices, gastrointestinal symptoms, physical performance, and intercurrent health events (including hospitalizations). For the 56 evaluable patients, those supplemented with NEF maintained their body weight significantly (p = 0.04) better, had significantly (p = 0.03) more stable triceps skin-fold measurements, and had significantly (p = 0.04) lower blood urea nitrogen than patients consuming the SEF supplement. Consumption of the NEF supplement was also associated with significantly reduced hospitalizations during the 3- to 6-mo evaluation period (p = 0.02). The NEF supplement was well tolerated and did not result in untoward clinical effects. These data suggest that supplemental use of an NEF provides superior nutritional management compared with an SEF for patients with early-stage HIV infection."

Twenty hemophiliacs coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), 18 of them under highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), with a mean CD4(+) cell count of 490 +/- 176 cells/mm(3) and undetectable (n = 9) or low-level HIV RNA (<10,000 copies/mL; n = 11), were treated with interferon-alfa2b (3 MU thrice weekly) and ribavirin (800 mg/d) for 6 or 12 months according to virologic response. Patients were monitored for tolerance and response at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks during treatment and every other month thereafter. All 20 patients enrolled completed at least 6 months of treatment with no major side effect requiring treatment withdrawal, dose reduction, or modification of HAART. Overall, 8 patients (40%) achieved a sustained virologic response at the end of the 6-month post-treatment follow-up. Sustained responders had lower baseline HCV-RNA levels (5.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 6.3 +/- 0.4 log10 IU/mL, P =.041) but were otherwise similar to nonresponders. All sustained responders had a decrease in HCV-RNA level of at least 1 log per month during the first 2 months and undetectable levels at 6 months. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin is safe in HIV-infected hemophiliacs with stable CD4 cell count and undetectable or low-level HIV replication, and leads to eradication of HCV in 40% of these patients."
12199,0.005,1.0000,"Natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, and T lymphocytes were analyzed by using a flow cytometer in 225 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals infected through the past sale of blood and plasma without receiving antiretroviral therapy in the People's Republic of China. According to CD4 T-cell counts these HIV-infected adults were stratified into three groups: long-term slow progressors, HIV-infected subjects, and AIDS patients. NK cell counts in long-term slow progressors were higher compared to HIV infection and AIDS patients (P < 0.05) and lower compared to normal controls (P < 0.05), whereas NKT cell counts in slow progressors and the HIV infection group were not different from those of normal controls. NK cell counts in HIV-seropositive subjects were positively correlated with CD4 T-cell counts (P < 0.05), and NKT cell counts were positively correlated with CD4 T-cell and CD8 T-cell counts (P < 0.05). The CD8 T-cell counts were higher in slow progressors compared to those with HIV infection, AIDS patients, and normal controls. These results indicated that HIV infection causes alterations of NK cells and T cells in slow progressors, HIV-infected subjects, and AIDS patient groups, but no difference was found in NKT cell counts and percentages in slow progressors and the HIV-infected group compared to normal controls."

Because HBV infection progresses through various disease phases, the cytolytic profiles of peripheral and intrahepatic NK cells in HBV-infected patients remain to be defined. In this study, we comprehensively characterized intrahepatic and peripheral NK cells in a cohort of HBV-infected individuals, and investigated their impact on liver pathogenesis during chronic HBV infection. The study population included 34 immune-clearance (IC) patients, 36 immune-tolerant (IT) carriers and 10 healthy subjects. We found that the activity of peripheral NK cells from IC patients was functionally elevated compared to IT carriers and controls, and NK cell activation was indicated by an increased expression of CD69, CD107a, interferon (IFN)-γ and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Further analysis showed that the increased activity of both peripheral and hepatic NK cells was correlated positively with liver injury, which was assessed by serum alanine aminotransferase levels (ALT) and the liver histological activity index (HAI). Interestingly, the frequency of peripheral NK cells was reduced in IC patients (especially those with higher HAI scores of 3-4), but there was a concomitant increase in hepatic NK cells. The functionally activated NK cells are enriched preferentially in the livers of IC patients and skew towards cytolytic activity that accelerates liver injury in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. "
17166,0.005,1.0000,": Natural killer (NK) cells are important effectors of innate immunity playing a key role in the eradication and clearance of viral infections. Over the recent years, several studies have shown that HIV-1 pathologically changes NK cell homeostasis and hampers their antiviral effector functions. Moreover, high levels of chronic HIV-1 viremia markedly impair those NK cell regulatory features that normally regulate the cross talks between innate and adaptive immune responses. These pathogenic events take place early in the infection and are associated with a pathologic redistribution of NK cell subsets that includes the expansion of anergic CD56/CD16 NK cells with an aberrant repertoire of activating and inhibitory receptors. Nevertheless, the presence of specific haplotypes for NK cell receptors and the engagement of NK cell antibody-dependent cell cytotocity have been reported to control HIV-1 infection. This dichotomy can be extremely useful to both predict the clinical outcome of the infection and to develop alternative antiviral pharmacological approaches. Indeed, the administration of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected patients restores NK cell phenotype and functions to normal levels. Thus, antiretroviral therapy can help to develop NK cell-directed therapeutic strategies that include the use of broadly neutralizing antibodies and toll-like receptor agonists. The present review discusses how our current knowledge of NK cell pathophysiology in HIV-1 infection is being translated both in experimental and clinical trials aimed at controlling the infection and disease."
13612,0.005,1.0000,"Accumulating evidence suggests that natural killer (NK) cells may have an important role in HIV-1 disease pathogenesis; however, in vivo studies are lacking. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection of cats provides a valuable model to study NK cell function in vivo. The immune response against Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is well characterized, allowing its use as an innate immune probe. We have previously shown that locally delivered IL-15 can improve Lm clearance in FIV-infected animals, and this correlated with an increase in NK cell number. In the present study, chronically FIV-infected and SPF-control cats were challenged with Lm by unilateral subcutaneous injection next to the footpad and then treated with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU). The Lm draining and contralateral control lymph nodes were evaluated for NK, NKT, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell number, proliferation, apoptosis, and NK cell function. Listeria monocytogenes burden was also assessed in both control and Lm draining lymph nodes. NK, NKT, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells in the Lm-challenged lymph node of FIV-infected cats did not increase in number. In addition, after Lm challenge, NK cells from FIV-infected cats did not increase their proliferation rate, apoptosis was elevated, and perforin expression was not upregulated when compared to SPF-control cats. The failure of the NK cell response against Lm challenge in the draining lymph node of FIV-infected cats correlates with the delayed control and clearance of this opportunistic bacterial pathogen."
4646,0.005,1.0000,"Persistent viral infections are associated with host and viral factors that impair effective antiviral immunity. Natural killer (NK) cells contribute to establishment of persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice through suppression of virus-specific T cell responses during the first few days of infection, but NK cell depletion during those early time points can enable severe T cell-mediated immune pathology and death of the host. Here we show that long after their peak in cytolytic activation, NK cells continue to support viral persistence at later times of infection. Delayed depletion of NK cells, 2 to 3 weeks after infection, enhanced virus-specific T cell responses and viral control. This enhancing effect of delayed NK cell depletion on antiviral immunity, in contrast to early NK cell depletion, was not associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and mice quickly regained weight after treatment. The efficacy of the depletion depended in part upon the size of the original virus inoculum, the viral load at the time of depletion, and the presence of CD4 T cells. Each of these factors is an important contributor to the degree of CD8 T cell dysfunction during viral persistence. Thus, NK cells may continuously contribute to exhaustion of virus-specific T cells during chronic infection, possibly by depleting CD4 T cells. Targeting of NK cells could thus be considered in combination with blockade of other immunosuppressive pathways, such as the interleukin-10 (IL-10) and programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathways, as a therapy to cure chronic human infections, including those with HIV or hepatitis C virus. IMPORTANCE Persistent virus infections are a major threat to global human health. The capacity of viruses, including HIV and hepatitis C virus, to overwhelm or subvert host immune responses contributes to a prolonged state of dampened antiviral immune functionality, which in turn facilitates viral persistence. Recent efforts have focused on therapeutics that can restore the effector functions of these functionally exhausted virus-specific T cells in order to expedite viral clearance. Here we establish that natural killer (NK) cells actively contribute to immune dysfunction and viral persistence at later stages of infection. This previously undescribed mechanism of immune suppression during chronic infection provides a vital clue for the design of novel therapeutic strategies targeting NK cell immunosuppressive activity in order to restore immune function and enhance viral control in chronically infected individuals.

Subjects at each dose level were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive rhIL-12 or placebo. Among the 47 subjects enrolled, rhIL-12 was well tolerated at doses of 3-300 ng/kg, but 4 of 5 subjects who received rhIL-12 at 1000 ng/kg had severe adverse events. Dose-related increases in serum interferon-gamma occurred after rhIL-12 administration at doses > or =30 ng/kg. There was no effect of rhIL-12 on plasma HIV RNA or absolute CD4(+) T cell counts. However, dose-related increases in absolute CD8(+) T and NK cells were observed in subjects assigned to rhIL-12 doses of 30-300 ng/kg. Single rhIL-12 doses of 30-300 ng/kg were well tolerated and had biologic activity that could potentially be of benefit in the treatment of HIV disease or its complications."
3456,0.005,1.0000,"Disease progression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with immune activation. Activation indices are higher during coinfection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV. The effect of immune activation on interferon α (IFN-α) therapy response is unknown. We evaluated soluble CD14 (sCD14) and natural killer (NK)-cell subsets at baseline, and during pegIFN-α2a/ribavirin therapy in HCV-HIV coinfection. The sCD14 level increased during therapy. Baseline sCD14 positively correlated with baseline HCV level and CD16(+)56(-) NK-cell frequency, and both sCD14 and CD16(+)56(-) NK cells correlated negatively with magnitude of HCV decline. IL28B genotype was associated with therapy response but not sCD14 or CD16(+)56(-) NK frequency.

7927,0.005,1.0000,"The control of the spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection within dialysis units has been an important goal in the management of patients on regular dialysis but infected patients continue to enter the dialysis system. It is evident that HBV viraemia in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients on dialysis is low but it remains unclear whether haemodialysis per se can contribute to viral load reduction in such patients. HBV DNA was determined in 40 HBsAg-positive patients on maintenance haemodialysis immediately before and at the end of a 4-h haemodialysis session. The same measurements were repeated 48 and 72 h later. Twenty (50%) of 40 HBsAg-positive patients had detectable HBV DNA in serum. Detectable HBV DNA in serum was not predicted by demographic, clinical or biochemical parameters. HBV load decreased in the majority of patients after haemodialysis, although the difference was not significant (29 390 +/- 48 820 vs 23 862.8 +/- 4 350 copies/mL, NS). There was a strong relationship between mean HBV DNA levels before dialysis and absolute reduction of HBV DNA during haemodialysis sessions (r = 0.75, P = 0.0001). No difference occurred in the magnitude of change in HBV DNA titre when comparing cellulosic to synthetic membranes. Haemodialysis per se leads to a reduction in HBV load in HBsAg-chronic carriers on maintenance dialysis. This phenomenon could explain the low viral loads in these patients. Prospective studies are in progress to identify the mechanisms responsible for reduction in HBV load during haemodialysis."
12196,0.005,1.0000,"To determine if levels of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA change over a several-year period, we quantified the amount of HCV RNA by competitive polymerase chain reaction. The population studied included 44 residents of a rural area with chronic HCV infection, 39 had chronic hepatitis C and 37 were patients on hemodialysis. All these Japanese patients had HCV RNA of genotype II. Blood samples were collected once a year from 1992 to 1995. From 1993 to 1995 between the groups, there was no significant difference in change of HCV RNA levels of 44 residents with chronic HCV infection, with and without liver dysfunction, nor was there any change in the 31 hemodialysis patients from 1992 to 1995. The HCV RNA levels in the 25 with chronic hepatitis who did not respond to interferon-alpha during 1992-1993 returned to pretreatment levels after the cessation of interferon treatment. In two of six hemodialysis patients who were infected with HCV during this observation period, HCV RNA was eliminated within one year, and the remaining four became HCV carriers. HCV RNA levels in the latter rose rapidly after infection and were sustained at a high level throughout the study period. Thus, HCV RNA level did not change remarkably during a three-year period, a finding which supports that it does not correlate with deterioration of liver damage and aging of HCV carriers."

Eligible patients of either sex had CD4 counts of 50-300/microl twice within 1 month of study entry and had received 26 months of antiretroviral treatment (ZDV or ddI) at a stable dose for the month before entry. CD4 counts were made every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. P24 antigen was measured at entry and every 12 weeks thereafter. Sequential quantitative lymphocyte cultures for HIV and ZDV pharmacokinetics were performed in a subset of patients. Sixty-three patients were randomized. All were males (mean age 39 years). The mean baseline CD4 counts were 165 and 147/microl in the placebo and acemannan groups, respectively; 90 percent of the patients were receiving ZDV at entry. Six patients in the acemannan group and five in the placebo group developed AIDS-defining illnesses. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups at 48 weeks with regard to the absolute change or rate of decline at CD4 count. Among ZDV-treated patients, the median rates of CD4 change (ACD4) in the initial 16 weeks were - 121 and - 120 cells per year in the placebo and acemannan groups, respectively ( p = 0.45), ACD4 from week 16 to 48 was 0 and - 61 cells per year in the acemannan and placebo groups (p = .11), respectively. There was no statistical difference between groups with regard to adverse events, p24 antigen, quantitative virology, or pharmacokinetics. Twenty-four patients, 11 receiving placebo and 13 receiving acemannan, discontinued study therapy prematurely, none due to serious adverse reactions. Our results demonstrate that acemannan at an oral daily dose of 1600 mg does not prevent the decline in CD4 count characteristic of progressive HIV disease. Acemannan showed no significant effect on p24 antigen and quantitative virology. Acemannan was well tolerated and showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction with ZDV."
8780,0.005,1.0000,"Nearly 2 million people are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Latin America. However, information regarding population-scale outcomes from a regional perspective is scarce. We aimed to describe the baseline characteristics and therapeutic outcomes of newly-treated individuals with HIV infection in Latin America. A Retrospective cohort study was undertaken. The primary explanatory variable was combination antiretroviral therapy based on either a protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). The main outcome was defined as the composite of all-cause mortality and the occurrence of an AIDS-defining clinical event or a serious non-AIDS-defining event during the first year of therapy. The secondary outcomes included the time to a change in treatment strategy. All analyses were performed according to the intention to treat principle. A total of 937 treatment-naive patients from four participating countries were included (228 patients with PI therapy and 709 with NNRTI-based treatment). At the time of treatment initiation, the patients had a mean age of 37 (SD: 10) years and a median CD4 + T-cell count of 133 cells/mm(3) (interquartile range: 47.5-216.0). Patients receiving PI-based regimens had a significantly lower CD4 + count, a higher AIDS prevalence at baseline and a shorter time from HIV diagnosis until the initiation of treatment. There was no difference in the hazard ratio for the primary outcome between groups. The only covariates associated with the latter were CD4 + cell count at baseline, study site and age. The estimated hazard ratio for the time to a change in treatment (NNRTI vs PI) was 0.61 (95% CI 0.47-0.80, p < 0.01). This study concluded that patients living with HIV in Latin America present with similar clinical outcomes regardless of the choice of initial therapy. Patients treated with PIs are more likely to require a treatment change during the first year of follow up."
17536,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of the brain causes a complex cascade of cellular events involving several different cell types that eventually leads to neuronal cell death and the manifestation of the AIDS-associated dementia complex (ADC). Upon autopsy HIV-infected individuals show lesions within subcortical regions of the brain, including the cerebellum. Previously we have demonstrated, in primary and cell culture models of rat and human astrocytes, a change in intracellular pH (pH(i)) due to increased Na(+)/H(+) exchange following exposure to inactivated virus or gp120, the major HIV envelope glycoprotein. To further investigate whether any such in vivo pH(i) changes occur in human brains subsequent to HIV infection, we measured the pH(i) of the cerebellum in eight HIV-positive individuals and nine healthy volunteers using (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) at high field strength (4.1 T). The results showed a significant difference between the age-adjusted mean pH(i) in the cerebellum in control group and patient groups (7.11 +/- 0.03 vs 7.16 +/- 0.04), and further HIV-infected individuals displayed a significant increase in the number of cerebellar volume elements that were alkaline. We hypothesize that this propensity towards alterations in cerebellar pH(i) may portend later neurological involvement resulting from HIV infection."

These ""elite"" controllers are of high interest as they may provide novel insights regarding host mechanisms of virus control. The degree to which these individuals have residual plasma viremia has not been well defined. We performed a longitudinal study of 46 elite controllers, defined as HIV-seropositive, antiretroviral-untreated individuals with plasma HIV RNA levels of <50 to 75 copies/ml. The median duration of HIV diagnosis was 13 years, the median baseline CD4(+) T-cell count was 753 cells/mm(3), and the median duration of follow-up was 16 months. Plasma and cellular HIV RNA levels were measured using the transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay (estimated limit of detection of <3.5 copies RNA/ml). A total of 1,117 TMA assays were performed (median of five time points/subject and four replicates/time point). All but one subject had detectable plasma HIV RNA on at least one time point, and 15 (33%) subjects had detectable RNA at all time points. The majority of controllers also had detectable cell-associated RNA and proviral DNA. A mixed-effect linear model showed no strong evidence of change in plasma RNA levels over time. In conclusion, the vast majority (98%) of elite controllers had measurable plasma HIV RNA, often at levels higher than that observed in antiretroviral-treated patients. This confirms the failure to eradicate the virus, even in these unique individuals who are able to reduce plasma viremia to very low levels without antiretroviral therapy."

1698,0.005,1.0000,"Resistance assays are useful in guiding decisions for patients experiencing virologic failure (VF) during highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We investigated antiretroviral resistance mutations in 41 Korean human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected patients with VF and observed immunologic/virologic response 6 months after HAART regimen change. Mean HAART duration prior to resistance assay was 45.3+/-27.5 months and commonly prescribed HAART regimens were zidovudine/lamivudine/nelfinavir (22.0%) and zidovudine/lamivudine/efavirenz (19.5%). Forty patients (97.6%) revealed intermediate to high-level resistance to equal or more than 2 antiretroviral drugs among prescribed HAART regimen. M184V/I mutation was observed in 36 patients (87.7%) followed by T215Y/F (41.5%) and M46I/L (34%). Six months after resistance assay and HAART regimen change, median CD4+ T cell count increased from 168 cells/microL (interquartile range [IQR], 62-253) to 276 cells/microL (IQR, 153-381) and log viral load decreased from 4.65 copies/mL (IQR, 4.18-5.00) to 1.91 copies/mL (IQR, 1.10-3.60) (P<0.001 for both values). The number of patients who accomplished viral load <400 copies/mL was 26 (63.4%) at 6 months follow-up.

4230,0.005,1.0000,"Efavirenz, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, is a highly effective and widely prescribed antiretroviral agent. It is recommended as first-line treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The standard dose of efavirenz is 600 mg/day; however, adverse central nervous system effects limit its use. Few data citing use of efavirenz at lower doses have been published. We describe a 35-year-old man with HIV infection whose virologic suppression was maintained after 18 months of treatment with efavirenz 400 mg/day. Genetic testing for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 showed that the patient was a heterozygous variant; patients with this polymorphism tend to have higher plasma efavirenz concentrations and slower plasma efavirenz clearance (prolonged elimination half-lives). Therapeutic drug monitoring also supported the dose reduction in this patient. Even with the 400-mg dose, the patient's plasma trough concentrations exceeded the upper limit of the therapeutic range. However, as he remained completely asymptomatic with this dose, no further dose reduction was necessary. This case report provides evidence that reduced efavirenz doses may be effective in the treatment of HIV infection. In addition, this case demonstrates that pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic testing combined with therapeutic drug monitoring may be used to guide reduced-dose, efavirenz-based therapy."

The participants had hepatitis C infection and poor venous access due to current or former drug use. Interview audiotapes were analyzed, and the themes - conflict, emotional responses, the patient as expert, and offering solutions - were identified. In the context of this study, we discuss the difficulties associated with phlebotomy, which might explain why individuals with hepatitis C infection and venous damage disengage from health services and are less likely to undertake antiviral treatment. This research adds to the literature on phlebotomy for vulnerable groups, and recommends hepatitis C virus clinics within drug agencies, the need to review training and policy, and the development of ""phlebotomy passports"" to enable continuity of care between services.

Records pertaining to patients attending the study site between 1997 and 2004 were reviewed. Six hundred and fifty five HIV/TB-coinfected patients (mean age 33 years, 79% male) who attended the service during the study period were included. After the intervention, MDRTB rates declined to 20% of TB cases by the year 2004 (P = 0.01). Extremely limited access to antiretroviral therapy and specific MDRTB therapy did not change during this period, and concurrently, national MDRTB prevalence increased, implying that the infection control measures caused the fall in MDRTB rates. The infection control measures were estimated to have cost US$91,031 while preventing 97 MDRTB cases, potentially saving US$1,430,026. Thus, this intervention significantly reduced MDRTB within an HIV care facility in this resource-constrained setting and should be cost-effective."

This study was conducted to identify sexual risk behavior and examine relationships between unprotected sex and CD4 levels among HIV-infected patients receiving ART in the National Antiretroviral Program. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 460 HIV-infected patients age 18-49 years who visited the out-patient clinic of Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute in February 2006 by using a standardized self-administered questionnaire. The results show that 60.4% of participants were men. The median most recent CD4 cell count during the prior 6 months was 261 cells/mm3. Twenty-three percent of the participants who had no sexual activity after they knew their HIV positive status started having sex again after receiving ART with a 12-week median duration period from starting ART to having first sex. There was a significant difference between the number of those having sexual activity before and after starting ART (p-value=0.013). Fifty-six percent of participants had sex during the previous 6 months. Of these, 26.5% had sex with commercial partners and 28.4% with non-regular partners. Inconsistent condom use, with commercial partners or non-regular partners, in females (35.3-36.8%) was higher than in males (7.8-11.1%).

With the development of HIV infection in Chad, tuberculosis has quickly become a major public health concern. The purpose of this cross-sectional study in two tuberculosis centres (Moundou and Ndjamena) was to evaluate HIV seroprevalence, epidemiological characteristics and risk factors in patients with tuberculosis. All patients with positive sputum-smears who had never been treated for tuberculosis previously were eligible. A total of 466 patients (sex ratio M/F: 1.96) were included during the six-month period between January and June 99. Each subject was asked to fill out an anonymous standardized questionnaire with detailed information on demographic characteristics, sexual behavior and other risk factors for HIV infection. Data were compared using the Chi-square test, Student's T test and multivariate analysis (logistic regression). One third (33.2%) of patients was seropositive for HIV-1. Mean age was 31.1 years in HIV-positive group and 33.6 years in the HIV-negative group (p = 0.02). The age groups with the highest risk for HIV were 20-29 years and 30-39 years (p < 0.01). Women were more often seropositive that men (39.5% versus 30.1%; p = 0.04). Seropositive patients were more likely to have multiple sexual partners (mean: 1.76; p < 0.01) and a history of sexually transmitted disease (19.9% versus 8.1%; p = 0.01). The mean age at the time of first sexual relations was 16.3 years in the HIV group and 17.1 years in the control (p < 0.01). The percentage of seropositive patients was 39.6% at Moundou and 29.8% at N'djamena (p > 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that early age of first sex relation (OR = 0.85; 95% IC: 0.74-0.97), higher number of sexual partners (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.4-2.4) and level of education were strongly correlated with HIV infection. The prevalence of HIV in tuberculosis patients is a good indicator of HIV-infection in developing countries. Prevalence of HIV infection is high in tuberculosis patients in Chad. Surveillance for tuberculosis and AIDS must be strengthened in Chad. Mores cooperation is needed between tuberculosis and AIDS control programs.

The goal of this study was to characterize HBV/HCV dual infection in a large multiethnic, matched, case-control study of dual-infected and HBV-monoinfected patients at two United States centers. Using an International Classification of Disease Version 9 electronic query and chart review, we identified 115 HBV/HCV dual-infected patients with serial HBV DNA, HCV RNA, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. As a control, 115 HBV-monoinfected patients were chosen randomly and matched with cases by age ±10 years, sex, Asian versus non-Asian ethnicity, and study site. Both groups had similar sex, ethnic, and age distributions (68% male, 83% Asian, age 52 ± 14 years). The median follow-up times were 33 and 38 months for the dual-infected and monoinfected groups, respectively. More monoinfected patients received HBV antiviral therapy than dual-infected patients (43% versus 24%; P = 0.002). No significant difference was detected between the proportion of monoinfected versus dual-infected patients with ALT above 40 U/L at presentation or during follow-up. Dual infection patients exhibited very little HBV/HCV codominance at baseline and throughout follow-up: patients had either HBV viremia with low or absent HCV RNA or detectable HCV RNA with low or absent HBV DNA.

A total of 500 anti-HCV-positive, human immunodeficiency virus-negative index subjects and their long-term heterosexual partners were studied. Couples were interviewed separately for lifetime risk factors for HCV infection, within-couple sexual practices, and sharing of personal grooming items. Blood samples were tested for anti-HCV, HCV RNA, and HCV genotype and serotype. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis determined the relatedness of virus isolates among genotype-concordant couples. The majority of HCV-positive index subjects were non-Hispanic white, with a median age of 49 years (range, 26-79 years) and median of 15 years (range, 2-52 years) of sexual activity with their partners. Overall, HCV prevalence among partners was 4% (n=20), and nine couples had concordant genotype/serotype. Viral isolates in three couples (0.6%) were highly related, consistent with transmission of virus within the couple. Based on 8,377 person-years of follow-up, the maximum incidence rate of HCV transmission by sex was 0.07% per year (95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.13) or approximately one per 190,000 sexual contacts. No specific sexual practices were related to HCV positivity among couples."
9438,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been linked to extrahepatic manifestations such as oral lichen planus (OLP). In addition, anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and cryoglobulin have been demonstrated in chronic hepatitis C. The aim of this study was to investigate these prevalences in patients with HCV-associated OLP. The prospective study investigated the role of these factors in 133 subjects: 28 with OLP-HCV(+) (group 1), 22 with OLP-HCV(-) (group 2), 33 without OLP-HCV(+) (group 3), and 50 healthy volunteers matched for age and sex served as control group (group 4). Levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM aCL antibodies, and cryoglobulin in serum were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The prevalence of aCL in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 32.1, 18, 36.3, and 8%, respectively. The positive rate of aCL was significantly higher in groups 1 and 3 than that in the control group (group 1; p=0.02 vs. the control group, group 3; p<0.01 vs. the control group). There were no significant differences in cryoglobulin among the groups. The findings of the present study showed a high prevalence of IgG and IgM aCL in the serum of patients with HCV infectious diseases. A positive factor for aCL was determined by age, sex, the presence of OLP, and HCV infection."
18819,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of HIV infection in HCV patients is much lower than the prevalence of HCV infection in HIV patients. Whereas the higher prevalence of HCV infection in HIV is clearly related to drug abuse, the reasons for the lower prevalence of HIV infection in HCV patients has not been reported. The prevalence of non-sexual and sexual risk factors associated with acquisition of hepatitis C and HIV were studied in HIV-mono-infected, HCV-mono-infected, and HCV/HIV-co-infected individuals. None of the 114 HCV-mono-infected patients tested positive for HIV and this finding was associated with a significantly lower number of men who have sex with men (MSM) among the HCV-mono-infected subjects than among either the HIV-mono-infected or HCV/HIV-co-infected individuals. Unprotected anal intercourse and sex for money or drugs were reported less often by HCV-mono-infected individuals than by HIV-mono-infected and HCV/HIV-co-infected subjects. Having sex with an intravenous-drug user (IVDU) was reported more frequently by both HCV-mono-infected and HCV/HIV-co-infected individuals than by HIV-mono-infected individuals. Sub-analysis of the group of MSM revealed that IVDU differentiated between HIV-mono-infected and HCV/HIV-co-infected subjects. These results reveal that the lower prevalence of HIV in HCV patients is related to a lower number of MSM in this group and that sex with an IVDU is a surrogate marker for drug abuse related to acquiring HCV but not HIV. The guidelines should include strategies for testing for HCV and HIV in patients with these infections."
4460,0.005,1.0000,"Biological sex differences affect the course of HIV infection, with untreated women having lower viral loads compared to their male counterparts but, for a given viral load, women have a higher rate of progression to AIDS. However, the vast majority of data on viral evolution, a process that is clearly impacted by host immunity and could be impacted by sex differences, has been derived from men. We conducted an intensive analysis of HIV-1 gag and env-gp120 evolution taken over the first 6-11 years of infection from 8 Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) participants who had not received combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). This was compared to similar data previously collected from men, with both groups infected with HIV-1 subtype B. Early virus populations in men and women were generally homogenous with no differences in diversity between sexes. No differences in ensuing nucleotide substitution rates were found between the female and male cohorts studied herein. As previously reported for men, time to peak diversity in env-gp120 in women was positively associated with time to CD4+ cell count below 200 (P = 0.017), and the number of predicted N-linked glycosylation sites generally increased over time, followed by a plateau or decline, with the majority of changes localized to the V1-V2 region. These findings strongly suggest that the sex differences in HIV-1 disease progression attributed to immune system composition and sensitivities are not revealed by, nor do they impact, global patterns of viral evolution, the latter of which proceeds similarly in women and men."
3083,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to study the development of HCV-specific T cell immunity during acute HCV infection in the presence of an existing HIV-1 infection in four HIV-1 infected men having sex with men. A comprehensive analysis of HCV-specific T cell responses was performed at two time points during acute HCV infection using a T cell expansion assay with overlapping peptide pools spanning the entire HCV genome Three patients with (near) normal CD4+ T cell counts (range 400-970 x 10(6)/L) either resolved (n=1) or temporary suppressed HCV RNA. In contrast, one patient with low CD4+ T cell counts (330 x 10(6)/L), had sustained high HCV RNA levels. All four patients had low HCV-specific CD8+ T cell responses, and similar magnitudes of CD4+ T cell responses. Interestingly, individuals with resolved infection or temporary suppression of HCV-RNA had HCV-specific CD4+ T cell responses predominantly against nonstructural (NS) proteins. While the individual with high HCV RNA plasma concentrations had CD4+ T cell responses predominantly directed against Core. Our data show that an acute HCV infection in an HIV-1 infected person can be suppressed in the presence of HCV-specific CD4+ T cell response targeting non-structural proteins. However further research is needed in a larger group of patients to evaluate the role of HIV-1 on HCV-specific T cell responses in relation to outcome of acute HCV infection."

Frozen serum specimens that were sequentially obtained over time from a cohort of 57 HIV-infected patients, all of whom tested positive only for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBcAg), were therefore retested for HBV markers, including HBV DNA. The results were assessed for their time course and correlated with clinical data and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values. Forty-eight patients were male; intravenous drug users constituted the principal risk group (n = 30), followed by homosexual men (n = 22). Thirty-three persons tested positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). During a median of 31 months from the first to the last serum, anti-HBcAg remained the sole marker of HBV infection in 98.2% of the patients. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect DNA for HBV core and HBV surface gene was positive in 126 (62.4%) and 121 (59.9%) of all 202 serum samples, respectively. Over time, HBV DNA was detected at least once in 51 (89.5%) patients. In contrast, decomplexed hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected at least once in 14 (24.6%) patients. Among patients positive for HBV DNA and negative for anti-HCV, eight (36.4%) of 22 had chronic hepatitis (ALT elevation > or = 6 months) that was attributable only to persisting HBV infection. Similarly, 12 (41.4%) of 29 patients positive for both HBV DNA and anti-HCV had chronic viral hepatitis, but their ALT values were significantly higher. In HIV-infected patients, anti-HBcAg as the sole serological HBV marker detected must be considered indicative of chronic HBV infection and is in part associated with chronic hepatitis and ALT elevation."

From 1 January 1990 to 1 January 1998 (82, 518 person-years of follow-up), 111 patients (98% men) were diagnosed with E. histolytica/E. dispar infection. Among HIV-infected patients in the United States, the incidence of diagnosed E. histolytica disease is low (13.5 cases per 10,000 person-years [95% confidence interval, 7.7-22.2], with diagnosis most common in those patients exposed to HIV through male-male sex."
8608,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals develop a genetically diverse virus population over time, but often only a limited number of viral variants are transmitted from a chronic carrier to a newly infected person. Interestingly, many women but few men are infected by multiple HIV-1 variants from a single partner. To determine whether the complexity of the infecting virus population influences clinical outcome, we examined viral diversity in the HIV-1 envelope sequences present at primary infection in 156 women from Kenya for whom we had follow-up data on viral RNA levels and CD4 T-cell counts. Eighty-nine women had multiple viral genotypes, while 67 women had a single genotype at primary infection. Women who acquired multiple viral genotypes had a significantly higher viral load (median, 4.84 versus 4.64 log(10) copies/ml, P = 0.04) and a significantly lower CD4(+)-T-cell count (median, 416 versus 617 cells/mm(3), P = 0.01) 4 to 24 months after infection compared to women who were infected with a single viral genotype. These studies suggest that early HIV-1 genetic diversity is linked to faster disease progression."
14372,0.005,1.0000,"The incidence of Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) is high in South Africa but the impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not well defined. We examined incidence and survival of KS in HIV-infected patients enrolled in South African ART programs. We analyzed data of three ART programs: Khayelitsha township and Tygerberg Hospital programs in Cape Town and Themba Lethu program in Johannesburg. We included patients aged >16 years. ART was defined as a regimen of at least three drugs. We estimated incidence rates of KS for patients on ART and not on ART. We calculated Cox models adjusted for age, sex and time-updated CD4 cell counts and HIV-1 RNA. A total of 18,254 patients (median age 34.5 years, 64% female, median CD4 cell count at enrolment 105 cells/μL) were included. During 37,488 person-years follow-up 162 patients developed KS. The incidence was 1,682/100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 1,406-2,011) among patients not receiving ART and 138/100,000 person-years (95% CI 102-187) among patients on ART. The adjusted hazard ratio comparing time on ART with time not on ART was 0.19 (95% CI 0.13-0.28). Low CD4 cell counts (time-updated) and male sex were also associated with KS. Estimated survival of KS patients at one year was 72.2% (95% CI 64.9-80.2) and higher in men than in women. The incidence of KS is substantially lower on ART than not on ART. Timely initiation of ART is essential to prevent KS and KS-associated morbidity and mortality in South Africa and other regions in Africa with a high burden of HIV. "
16747,0.005,1.0000,"To determine whether abnormalities of cell-mediated immunity are associated with chronic hepatitis B virus infection or with homosexuality, we studied 15 homo- and 11 heterosexual men with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, as well as 11 homo- and 16 heterosexual apparently healthy men. T lymphocyte subsets, natural killer activity, and suppressor cell activity were determined. Homosexual men had significantly lower peripheral blood T4/T8 ratios resulting from a significant increase in T8-positive (suppressor/cytotoxic) cells, and they also had lower natural killer activity. These effects of homosexuality were independent of chronic hepatitis B virus infection, which caused no significant changes independent of homosexuality, and they were not caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (formerly HTLV-III/LAV). Suppressor cell function was unaltered in this study. We conclude that studies of cellular immunity in hepatitis B virus infection must take male sexual preference into account."

Several natural history studies on homosexual men and intravenous drug users have been published from developed countries. A few studies have emerged on heterosexual populations from Africa. With an emerging epidemic, a similar study was required in India. This study was designed to determine the progression of HIV disease in a prevalent cohort of adult HIV-seropositive patients."
4975,0.005,1.0000,"Due to the large number of patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus and not responding to combination therapy with interferon-alfa 2 and ribavirin new therapeutic regimens are required. Early treatment of the viral infection might improve the response, as seen in treatment of HIV infection, thereby preventing progression to chronicity. The article reviews the natural course of an acute HCV infection after different modes of transmission like i.v.-drug abuse, transfusion, needle stick injury and blood products. As there are no good animal models for HCV infection, models of an acute infection with other noncytopathic viruses might improve our understanding of the mechanisms of viral clearance. Results from an acute infection of mice with the lymphocytic chorionmeningitis virus are demonstrating the development of a T-cell tolerance by anergy or deletion of virus specific T-cells as possible mechanisms for the failure of the immune system to clear the virus. These findings are compared to the results of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in patients with acute HCV infection. Several clinical trials have demonstrated a benefit of an early treatment of HCV infection. Although the natural course of acute HCV is changing during the last few years, even recent trials indicate that progression to chronicity might be prevented by early therapy. The studies show that therapy could be improved by daily dosing, higher single doses of interferon compared and prolongation of therapy up to six month. As most patients with acute HCV infection are rather seen in an outpatient practise than in hospitals cases of acute infections should be collected and treatment protocols be standardized to confirm these results in prospective trials. First results in 21 patients show that viral clearance under therapy was achievable in all of the patients."
10759,0.005,1.0000,"The relationship between plasma human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infectious titer, determined by quantitative fivefold end-point dilution culture, and the detection of genomic HIV-1 RNA by immunocapture-cDNA-polymerase chain reaction was determined. The optimal plasma specimen collection and storage conditions for the use of such virologic markers for clinical trials were also determined. The variabilities in the measurement of infectious HIVLAI titer associated with intra- and interdonor peripheral blood mononuclear cells were 1.2 and 0.86 log10 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/ml (95% confidence interval range), respectively. Plasma HIV-1 titers did not change significantly after storing whole blood for 6 h either at 4 degrees C or ambient temperature or plasma for a median of 267 days (range, 259 to 482) at -70 degrees C. The detection of genomic HIV-1 RNA encapsulated in viral particles was very consistent, reproducible, and unaffected by either heparin or acid citrate or by multiple freeze-thawing. The HIV-1 RNA titers also appeared to generally correlate with the biologic titer obtained by the microculture assay. The consistency in infectious HIV-1 titer was evaluated by using 27 unfrozen plasma specimens collected from five subjects over 1 to 9 days. The median change in HIV-1 titer relative to baseline was -0.5 log10 TCID50/ml (interquartile range, -1.03 to 0.175 log10). In contrast, no significant change in HIV-1 RNA for the same frozen plasma specimens was noted. As such, immunocapture-cDNA-polymerase chain reaction may be a useful measure of plasma viremia for studying the natural history of HIV disease and assessing response to therapy."
12556,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and incidence of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection among young (aged 29 years or younger) injection drug users (IDUs) and to compare sociodemographic and risk characteristics between (HIV/HCV) coinfected, monoinfected, or HIV- and HCV-negative youth. Data were collected through the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS). To date, more than 1400 IDUs have been enrolled and followed, of whom 479 were aged 29 years or younger. Semiannually, participants have completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire and have undergone serologic testing for HIV and HCV. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were undertaken to investigate predictors of baseline coinfection. Cox regression models with time-dependent covariates were used to identify predictors of time to secondary infection seroconversion. A Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to determine risk associations across 3 categories: no infection, monoinfection, and coinfection. Of the 479 young injectors, 78 (16%) were coinfected with HIV and HCV at baseline and a further 45 (15%) with follow-up data became coinfected during the study period. Baseline coinfection was independently associated with being female, being aboriginal, older age, greater number of years injecting, and living in the IDU epicenter. Factors independently associated with time to secondary infection seroconversion were borrowing needles and greater than once-daily cocaine injection, and accessing methadone maintenance therapy in the previous 6 months was protective. There were clear trends across the 3 categories for increasing proportions of female subjects, aboriginal subjects, older age, greater number of years injecting, living in the IDU epicenter, and daily cocaine use. There were a shocking number of youth living with coinfection, particularly female and aboriginal youth. The median number of years injecting for youth seroconverting to a secondary infection was 3 years, suggesting that appropriate public health interventions should be implemented immediately."

The aim of this study was to determine the reference values of CD4(+) T cells in a student population that was HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) negative. After ethical clearance and informed consent, 500 subjects (mean age = 26 years) were recruited, of whom 56 (11.2%) had HIV, HBV or HCV and were excluded. Blood samples were collected from the remaining 444 subjects into vacutainer tubes and analysed using the BD FACScount cytometer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Of the 444 subjects, 266 (59.9%) were male and 178 (40.1%) were female. The mean (± standard deviation) CD4(+) T cell count was 987 cells/µL (± 336). The mean counts among males and females were 957 cells/µL (± 306) and 991 cells/µL (± 340), respectively. Values of CD4(+) T cells ranged from 651 cells/µL to 1705 cells/µL. Subjects with higher CD4(+) T Cells were more likely to be female than male. There was no direct correlation between CD4(+) T cell values and age of the participants. Our findings offer the first insight into the CD4(+) T cell reference values of a Nigerian student population and provide useful data that will guide future cART decisions and other immune-based therapies."
1900,0.005,1.0000,"In Bolivia, no studies have been carried out specifically on hepatitis viruses. Thus, their prevalence and circulation patterns are virtually unknown. A seroepidemiologic study was performed from 1992 to 1996 to generate a preliminary idea of the overall prevalence of infection from hepatitis B, C, D, and E viruses (HBV, HCV, HDV, and HEV, respectively) in different Bolivian population groups. Prompted by the data obtained in other areas of Latin America, the study focused on indigenous communities in the Amazon region. In rural areas of the high Andean plateau, HBV infection showed an overall prevalence compatible with medium to low endemicity (11.2%), and no carriers of HCV or HDV antibodies were found. In two high-risk groups in the city of Cochabamba (homeless children and sexual workers), the prevalence of HBV infection was similar (11.6%) and could be considered low by comparison to that of similar population groups in Latin American urban centers. The prevalence of HCV (one positive case, or 0.5%) was similar to that found in similar population groups, although the small number of samples precludes drawing more definite conclusions. As has been noted previously with similar communities in tropical areas of South America, HBV infection is highly endemic in indigenous populations of the Bolivian Amazon (with an overall prevalence of 74.0%), but circulation of HCV has not been detected. It is a well-known fact that HBV is horizontally transmitted and that transmission can take place very early in life, but the mechanisms involved are unknown. By 10 years of age, more than half the population has already had the natural infection that, in approximately 10 more years will have affected virtually the entire population. The very low rate of positivity to HBsAg (1.6%), the absence of viral DNA in samples showing isolated positivity to anti-HBc, and the high prevalence of anti-HBs among individuals who show markers for natural infection (92.4%) suggest vertical transmission plays no role in persistent endemicity. So far, no outbreak of HDV infection has been documented in these communities, but the high endemicity shown by HBV points to the possibility of future outbreaks. Results obtained with tests for the detection of antibodies against HEV suggest that this virus is circulating widely in Bolivia and that it could have caused recent outbreaks in Cochabamba state. Vaccination against HBV in endemic populations is recommended as a short-term measure. Also recommended are actively searching for outbreaks and sporadic cases of hepatitis E in the entire country and performing additional research that will help in assessing the public health consequences of the situation described in this article."
6545,0.005,1.0000,"Indigenous Australians experience a significant health burden from chronic hepatitis B infection; however, the strain of hepatitis B virus (HBV) found among Indigenous Australians has not been well characterized. Blood samples were collected from 65 Indigenous Australians with chronic HBV infection from across the Top End of Australia's Northern Territory. Phylogenetic analysis of HBV from these samples revealed that 100% of the isolates were genotype C, sub-genotype C4, expressing the serotype ayw3. This strain is a divergent group within the HBV/C genotype, and has only been described in Indigenous Australians. Evidence of recombination was suggested by discordant phylogenetic clustering of the C4 sequences when comparing the full genome to the surface region and confirmed by recombination analysis which showed the surface gene region to be most closely related to genotype J, while the remaining regions of the genome were most similar to genotype C sequences. Mutational analysis revealed the presence of multiple mutations that have been linked with more rapid liver disease progression and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. These mutations were detected in the majority of sequences examined. Variants associated with vaccine failure were detected as the predominant viral quasi-species in 3/35 samples. In summary, the HBV C4 variant found in this population has a high potential to cause advanced liver disease and to escape vaccination programs. Further in vitro functional and natural history studies are warranted in order to determine the clinical and public health consequences of infection with the HBV C4 variant in these communities."
7074,0.005,1.0000,"From a global perspective, cardiovascular disease (CVD) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may result from cardiac involvement upon presentation of opportunistic infections in the presence of advanced immunosuppression, be a consequence of HIV-induced immune activation or derive from antiretroviral therapy-associated dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance. Indeed, in developed countries with unlimited access to antiretroviral therapy CVD has become one of the major causes of death in HIV. Therefore, cardiovascular risk reduction and lifestyle modifications are essential and careful selection of the antiretroviral drugs according to underlying cardiovascular risk factors of great importance. In developing countries with delayed roll-out of antiretroviral therapy pericardial disease (often related to TB), HIV-associated cardiomyopathy, and HIV-associated pulmonary hypertension are the most common cardiac manifestations in HIV. In Africa, the epicentre of the HIV epidemic, dynamic socio-economic and lifestyle factors characteristic of epidemiological transition appear to have positioned the urban African community at the cross-roads between historically prevalent and 'new' forms of CVD, such as coronary artery disease. In this context, cardiovascular risk assessment of HIV-infected patients will become a critical element of care in developing countries similar to the developed world, and access to antiretroviral therapy with little or no impact on lipid and glucose metabolism of importance to reduce CVD in HIV.

15154,0.005,1.0000,"With widespread availability and the use of antiretroviral therapy, patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States are living long enough to experience non-AIDS-defining illnesses. HIV is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) because of traditional CVD risk factors, residual virally mediated inflammation despite HIV treatment, and side effects of antiretroviral therapy. No United States population-wide studies have evaluated patterns of CVD mortality for HIV-infected subjects. Our central hypothesis was that the proportionate mortality from CVD (CVD mortality/total mortality) in the HIV-infected population increased from 1999 to 2013. We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research online database of the United States public health data to assess proportionate CVD mortality from 1999 to 2013 in the HIV-infected, general, and inflammatory polyarthropathy populations; the inflammatory polyarthropathy population was included as a positive control group. Total mortality in the HIV-infected population decreased from 15,739 in 1999 to 8,660 in 2013; however, CVD mortality increased from 307 to 400 during the same period. Thus, proportionate CVD mortality for the HIV-infected population increased significantly from 1999 to 2013 (p <0.0001); this pattern was consistent across races, particularly for men. In contrast, proportionate CVD mortality decreased for the general and inflammatory polyarthropathy populations from 1999 to 2013. In conclusion, CVD has become an increasingly common cause of death in HIV-infected subjects since 1999; understanding evolving mortality risks in the HIV-infected population is essential to inform routine clinical care of HIV-infected subjects as well as CVD prevention and treatment.

11503,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1, simian immunodeficiency virus and simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection generally lead to death of the host accompanied by high viraemia and profound CD4(+) T-cell depletion. SHIV clone KS661-infected rhesus macaques with a high viral load set point (HVL) ultimately experience diarrhoea and wasting at 6-12 months after infection. In contrast, infected macaques with a low viral load set point (LVL) usually live asymptomatically throughout the observation period, and are therefore referred to as asymptomatic LVL (Asym LVL) macaques. Interestingly, some LVL macaques exhibit diarrhoea and wasting similar to the symptoms of HVL macaques and are termed symptomatic LVL (Sym LVL) macaques. This study tested the hypothesis that Sym LVL macaques have the same degree of intestinal abnormalities as HVL macaques. The proviral DNA loads in lymphoid tissue and the intestines of Sym LVL and Asym LVL macaques were comparable and all infected monkeys showed villous atrophy. Notably, the CD4(+) cell frequencies of lymphoid tissues and intestines in Sym LVL macaques were remarkably lower than those in Asym LVL and uninfected macaques. Furthermore, Sym LVL and HVL macaques exhibited an increased number of activated macrophages. In conclusion, intestinal disorders including CD4(+) cell reduction and abnormal immune activation can be observed in SHIV-KS661-infected macaques independent of virus replication levels."
16248,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B coinfection is common in HIV-positive individuals and as antiretroviral therapy has made death due to AIDS less common, hepatitis has become increasingly important. Several drugs are available to treat hepatitis B. The most potent and the one with the lowest risk of resistance appears to be tenofovir (TDF). However there are several questions that remain unanswered regarding the use of TDF, including the proportion of patients that achieves suppression of HBV viral load and over what time, whether suppression is durable and whether prior treatment with other HBV-active drugs such as lamivudine, compromises the efficacy of TDF due to possible selection of resistant HBV strains."

Here we investigated long-term changes in virus load in patients treated with a combination of lamivudine and zidovudine to identify principal factors responsible for the observed 10- to 100-fold sustained suppression of virus load in vivo. Interestingly, most standard accounts of virus dynamics cannot explain a large sustained reduction without shifting the virus very close to extinction. The effect can be explained by taking into consideration either (i) the immune response against HIV, (ii) the killing of uninfected CD4 cells, or (iii) the differential efficacies of the drugs in different cell populations."
11545,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and recurrence are common in patients undergoing immunosuppression therapy. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockage therapy is effective for the treatment of many autoimmune inflammatory diseases. However, the role of TNF-α blockage therapy in the innate and adaptive immune responses against HBV is still not clear. A detailed analysis of HBV infection under TNF-α blockage therapy is essential for the prophylaxis and therapy for HBV reactivation and recurrence. In this study, HBV clearance and T-cell responses were analyzed in a HBV-transfected mouse model under anti-TNF blockage therapy. Our results demonstrated that under TNF-α blockage therapy, HBV viral clearance was impaired with persistent elevated HBV viral load in a dose- and temporal-dependent manner. The impairment of HBV clearance under anti-TNF-α blockage therapy occurred at early time points after HBV infection. In addition, TNF-α blockade maintained a higher serum HBV viral load and increased the number of intrahepatic programmed cell death (PD)-1(high)CD127(low) exhausted T cells. Furthermore, TNF-α blockade abolished Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand-induced facilitation of HBV viral clearance. Taken together, TNF-α blockade impairs HBV clearance and enhances viral load, and these effects depend on early administration after HBV infection. Our results here demonstrate that early TNF-α blockade reduces viral clearance and persistently maintains elevated HBV viral load in a mouse model, suggesting that HBV may reactivate during therapy with TNF-α-blocking agents."

The model incorporates two cell types (CD4+ T cells and a long-lived pool of cells), two strains of virus (drug-sensitive wild type and drug-resistant mutant) and two types of antiretroviral agents (reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors). The transient behavior of the cells and virus and the eventual eradication of the virus are determined primarily by the strength of the combination therapy against the mutant strain and the maximum achievable increase in the uninfected CD4+ T cell concentration. We also predict, if the parameters of the model remain constant during therapy, that less intensive maintenance regimens will be unable to maintain low viral loads for extensive periods of time. However, if the reduction in viral load produced by therapy reduces the state of activation of the immune system, the number of cells susceptible for HIV-1 infection may decrease even though total CD4+ T cells increase. Our model predicts that if this occurs strong inductive therapy that reduces viral load followed by weaker maintenance regimes may succeed."
3078,0.005,1.0000,"Reduced frequencies of myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (DC) subsets (mDCs and pDCs, respectively) have been observed in the peripheral blood of HIV-1-infected individuals throughout the course of disease. Accumulation of DCs in lymph nodes (LNs) may partly account for the decreased numbers observed in blood, but increased DC death may also be a contributing factor. We used multiparameter flow cytometry to evaluate pro- and antiapoptotic markers in blood mDCs and pDCs from untreated HIV-1-infected donors, from a subset of infected donors before and after receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and from uninfected control donors. Blood mDCs, but not pDCs, from untreated HIV-1-infected donors expressed lower levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 than DCs from uninfected donors. A subset of HIV-1-infected donors had elevated frequencies of proapoptotic caspase-3(+) blood mDCs, and positive correlations were observed between caspase-3(+) mDC frequencies and plasma viral load and CD8(+) T-cell activation levels. Caspase-3(+) mDC frequencies, but not mDC Bcl-2 expression, were reduced with viral suppression on ART. Apoptosis markers on DCs in blood and LN samples from a cohort of untreated, HIV-1-infected donors with chronic disease were also evaluated. LN mDCs displayed higher levels of Bcl-2 and lower caspase-3(+) frequencies than did matched blood mDCs. Conversely, LN pDCs expressed lower Bcl-2 levels than their blood counterparts. In summary, blood mDCs from untreated HIV-1-infected subjects displayed a proapoptotic profile that was partially reversed with viral suppression, suggesting that DC death may be a factor contributing to blood DC depletion in the setting of chronic, untreated HIV disease."
1049,0.005,1.0000,"Drug-naive patients infected with drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) who initiate antiretroviral therapy show a shorter time to virologic failure than patients infected with wild-type (WT) viruses. Resistance-related HIV genotypes not commonly seen in treated patients, which likely result from reversion or loss of primary resistance mutations, have also been recognized in drug-naive persons. Little work has been done to characterize the patterns of mutations in these viruses and the frequency of occurrence, their association with phenotypic resistance, and their effect on fitness and evolution of resistance. Through the analysis of resistance mutations in 1082 newly diagnosed antiretroviral-naive persons from the United States, we found that 35 of 48 (72.9%) persons infected with HIV-1 containing thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) had viruses that lacked a primary mutation (T215Y/F, K70R, or Q151M). Of these viruses, 9 (25.7%) had only secondary TAMs (D67N, K219Q, M41L, or F77L), and all were found to be sensitive to zidovudine (AZT) and other drugs. To assess the impact of secondary TAMs on the evolution of AZT resistance, we generated recombinant viruses from cloned plasma-derived reverse transcriptase sequences. Two viruses had D67N, three had D67N and K219Q/E, and three were WT. Four site-directed mutants with D67N, K219Q, K219E, and D67N/K219Q were also made in HIV-1(HXB2). In vitro selection of AZT resistance showed that viruses with D67N and/or K219Q/E acquired AZT resistance mutations more rapidly than WT viruses (36 days compared to 54 days; P = 0.003). To investigate the factors associated with the rapid selection of AZT mutations in these viruses, we evaluated fitness differences among HXB2(WT) and HXB2(D67N) or HXB2(D67N/K219Q) in the presence of AZT. Both HXB2(D67N/K219Q) and HXB2(D67N) were more fit than HXB2(WT) in the presence of either low or high AZT concentrations, likely reflecting low-level resistance to AZT that is not detectable by phenotypic testing. In the absence of AZT, the fitness cost conferred by D67N or K219Q was modest. Our results demonstrate that viruses with unique patterns of TAMs, including D67N and/or K219Q/E, are commonly found among newly diagnosed persons and illustrate the expanding diversity of revertant viruses in this population. The modest fitness cost conferred by D67N and K219Q supports persistence of these mutants in the untreated population and highlights the potential for secondary transmission. The faster evolution of these mutants toward AZT resistance is consistent with the higher viral fitness in the presence of AZT and shows that these viruses are phenotypically different from WT HIV-1. Our study emphasizes the need for clinical studies to better define the impact of these mutants on treatment responses and evolution of resistance."
1717,0.005,1.0000,"Research has focused on understanding injecting drug use initiation in the era of HIV/AIDS. However, differences between new and longer-term injecting drug users (IDUs) have not received as much attention. This study examined injecting initiation experience, risk and risk reduction practices, and self-reported HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing practices and infection among new (injecting < or =4 years) and longer-term IDUs. Data from 3 cross-sectional surveys in 1992, 1994, and 1997 of syringe exchange program (SEP) users in Oslo, Norway, were used. Approximately one fifth of IDUs were new injectors. New IDUs were increasingly indistinguishable from longer-term IDUs in terms of socio-demographics, risk practices, and HIV and HCV testing. The prevalence of HIV infection remained low (5%); in contrast, approximately two thirds of all SEP users reported being HCV-infected. Known HCV infection status had no impact on syringe sharing; most HCV-infected SEP users reported sharing syringes, regardless of the duration of injecting. The only variable associated with HCV infection was injecting < or =4 years (adjusted odds ratio = 0.2; 95% confidence interval = 0.1-0.4). Increased similarity in age between new and longer-term IDUs may have contributed to the rapid spread of HCV infection by facilitating mixing patterns between HCV-infected and -susceptible IDUs."
8234,0.005,1.0000,"Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is an effective treatment for HIV, many physicians withhold this treatment from HIV-positive injecting drug users (IDUs) because of fears of non-adherence and consequent development of antiretroviral resistance. Little is known, however, about whether the rates of resistance differ between IDUs and non-IDUs. We did a meta-analysis of studies that compared antiretroviral resistance rates in IDUs (current or previous) with those in HIV-positive patients infected by other routes and who had never injected drugs. We used a random-effects model to investigate overall resistance rates and resistance to individual drug classes. Of 181 potential studies, 27 were eligible for review. We were able to extract data from 14 studies, but two were excluded because of a very small sample size of IDUs or data being available only from a secondary analysis. Thus we included 12 studies in the meta-analysis, involving 9055 patients, of which 2054 (23%) were IDUs. The risk of development of antiretroviral resistance did not differ significantly between IDU and non-IDU (odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.74-1.45, p=0.84). Rates of loss to follow-up and virological failure were similar in IDU and non-IDU samples. Existing evidence does not support the common practice of withholding antiretroviral therapy from HIV-positive IDU on the basis of an elevated risk of antiretroviral resistance. Therapeutic guidelines should consider reassessment of this issue."
5670,0.005,1.0000,"Little is known of the role of classical HLA-A and -B class I alleles in determining resistance, susceptibility, or the severity of acute viral infections. Appropriate paradigms for immunogenetic studies of acute viral infections are dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Both primary and secondary infections with dengue virus (DEN) serotypes 1, 2, 3 or 4, can result in either clinically less severe DF or the more severe DHF. In secondary exposures, a memory response is induced in immunologically primed individuals, which can both clear the infecting dengue virus and contribute to its pathology. In a case-control study of 263 ethnic Thai patients infected with either DEN-1, -2, -3 or -4, we detected HLA class I associations with secondary infections, but not in immunologically naive patients with primary infections. HLA-A*0203 was associated with the less severe DF, regardless of the secondary infecting virus serotype. By contrast, HLA-A*0207 was associated with susceptibility to the more severe DHF in patients with secondary DEN-1 and DEN-2 infections only. Conversely, HLA-B*51 was associated with the development of DHF in patients with secondary infections, and HLA-B*52 was associated with DF in patients with secondary DEN-1 and DEN-2 infections. Moreover, HLA-B44, B62, B76 and B77 also appeared to be protective against developing clinical disease after secondary dengue virus infection. These results confirm that classical HLA class I alleles are associated with the clinical outcome of exposure to dengue virus, in previously exposed and immunologically primed individuals."
14719,0.005,1.0000,"The evolutionary dynamics of RAL resistance in the HIV-2 virus were examined through population and clonal sequence analysis of the IN from baseline, during treatment, and after stopping RAL therapy. The treatment failure of an RAL regimen in the HIV-2 patient studied was associated with the emergence of mutations via the N155H resistance pathway and subsequent switching to the Y143C mutational route. This study has also identified four novel secondary mutations, Q91R, S147G, A153G, and M183I, not previously reported in HIV-1 patients failing RAL therapy. Resistant variants involving the Y143C pathway were noted to have persisted beyond 4 weeks following the cessation of RAL therapy. All resistance-associated mutations were lost at 20 weeks after stopping RAL therapy. Our findings provide evidence supporting the supposition that substantial cross-resistance between strand transfer IN-Is is likely in HIV-2 as shown in HIV-1."
17915,0.005,1.0000,"The emergence of drug resistance remains a major problem during antiretroviral treatment of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). As phenotypic drug resistance is laborious and expensive to determine, and because numerous specific mutations are known to be correlated with different resistance patterns, genotyping of the reverse transcriptase and protease genes of HIV is fast becoming an integral part of HIV management in industrialized countries. A number of software-based interpretation systems have been developed for the interpretation of the resulting complex nucleotide sequences. These programs either employ rule-based algorithms or are based on a genotype-phenotype database. This paper reviews recent publications that compare different such systems, trying to identify the degree of discordance between different systems and the reasons underlying such discrepant interpretations. The highest discordance rate was observed for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) followed by protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). For the NRTIs, it is the role of nucleoside analogue associated mutations, for the PIs and for the NNRTIs, that of secondary mutations that causes most discrepancies. As the complexity of the mutation pattern is likely to increase further with new drugs becoming available, rule-based genotype interpretation algorithms need to be updated frequently. Whilst not recommending one particular system, the authors believe that the correlation of genotypic with clinical data is probably the best way to develop an optimal algorithm."
8042,0.005,1.0000,"The impact of HIV-1 subtype on clinical outcome following exposure to antiretroviral therapy is currently not well known. Natural polymorphisms are often present in HIV-1 non-B subtypes at positions known to be associated with drug resistance in clade B viruses. These changes might influence the emergence of drug-resistant viruses, modifying drug susceptibility and/or the virus replicative capacity. Moreover, different pathways may lead to drug resistance according to HIV-1 clade. Finally, the influence of subtype on the performance of phenotypic assays and in the interpretation of algorithms for genotypic resistance is currently a matter of debate. All these aspects explain why the response to antiretroviral therapy might vary in subjects infected with different HIV-1 clades."
2136,0.005,1.0000,"CRF01_AE is a major subtype of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) circulating in Southeast Asia, including Thailand. We performed genotypic studies on HIV-1 CRF01_AE integrase derived from plasma samples from drug-naive Thai patients. Direct sequencing of amplified CRF01_AE integrase genes revealed that although no primary mutations associated with drug resistance to integrase inhibitors were detected, at least one secondary mutation was found in 96% of samples. Our results indicate that the impact of these mutations on the baseline drug susceptibility of CRF01_AE viruses to integrase inhibitors may need to be addressed prior to the introduction of these drugs in Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand."
18414,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) controllers maintain viremia at <2,000 RNA copies/ml without antiretroviral therapy. Viruses from controllers with chronic infection were shown to exhibit impaired replication capacities, in part associated with escape mutations from cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses. In contrast, little is known about viruses during acute/early infection in individuals who subsequently become HIV controllers. Here, we examine the viral replication capacities, HLA types, and virus sequences from 18 HIV-1 controllers identified during primary infection. gag-protease chimeric viruses constructed using the earliest postinfection samples displayed significantly lower replication capacities than isolates from persons who failed to control viremia (P = 0.0003). Protective HLA class I alleles were not enriched in these early HIV controllers, but viral sequencing revealed a significantly higher prevalence of drug resistance mutations associated with impaired viral fitness in controllers than in noncontrollers (6/15 [40.0%] versus 10/80 [12.5%], P = 0.018). Moreover, of two HLA-B57-positive (B57(+)) controllers identified, both harbored, at the earliest time point tested, signature escape mutations within Gag that likewise impair viral replication capacity. Only five controllers did not express ""protective"" alleles or harbor viruses with drug resistance mutations; intriguingly, two of them displayed typical B57 signature mutations (T242N), suggesting the acquisition of attenuated viruses from B57(+) donors. These data indicate that acute/early stage viruses from persons who become controllers have evidence of reduced replication capacity during the initial stages of infection which is likely associated with transmitted or acquired CTL escape mutations or transmitted drug resistance mutations. These data suggest that viral dynamics during acute infection have a major impact on HIV disease outcome."
18931,0.005,1.0000,"We have recently described a significant correlation between human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) RNA replication and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of individuals with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) with HIV encephalitis (E). Because local macrophages (microglia) are the cells predominantly infected in the brain, we investigated whether in vitro HIV infection affects MCP-1 production in mononuclear phagocytes (MP). MCP-1 secretion and expression were consinstently upregulated over constitutive levels in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) infected with the M-tropic R5 BaL strain of HIV-1. HIV replication was required for this effect, as demonstrated by the absence of chemokine upregulation after infection in the presence of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythimidine (AZT) or cell-exposure to heat-inactivated (triangle up degrees ) virus. MCP-1 induction was not restricted to HIV-1 BaL, but was also observed during productive infection of MDM with two primary isolates differing for entry coreceptor usage and of U937 cells with the X4 HIV-1 MN strain. Based on the observation that exogenous HIV-1 Tat induced MCP-1 expression in astrocytes, we also investigated its role in MDM and U937 cells. Exogenous Tat induced MCP-1 production from MDM in a concentration-dependent manner, however, it was not effective on uninfected U937 cells or on the chronically infected U937-derived cell line U1. Transfection of Tat-expressing plasmids moderately activated HIV expression in U1 cells, but failed to induce MCP-1 expression in this cell line or in uninfected U937 cells. HIV replication-dependent expression of MCP-1 in MP may be of particular relevance for the pathogenesis of HIV infection in nonlymphoid organs such as the brain."
5464,0.005,1.0000,"Serum cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) values and CD4 cell count were evaluated in 25 perinatally HIV-1-infected children. The children were divided into three groups: group 1 included eight asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic children, group 2 nine moderately symptomatic children, and group 3 eight children with severe clinical manifestations. Group 1 children were without antiretroviral therapy; the remaining children received zidovudine (AZT) treatment. Only one group 3 patient had primary adrenal insufficiency. No significant differences in cortisol and ACTH secretion were found either between all HIV-1-infected and 126 age- and sex-matched normal children or among the three groups of patients. Mean CD4 cell count of each group declined in parallel to disease progression. No correlations were found between cortisol or ACTH values and CD4 cell count. Adrenal failure may be a late complication of HIV-1 infection and should be searched for in severely ill patients. Our data argue against the hypothesis of a cortisol-induced shift from T-helper-1 (Th1) to Th2 cytokine production profile as the pathogenetic mechanism of progression to AIDS."
10403,0.005,1.0000,"As the AIDS epidemic continues with women being disproportionately affected, it is crucial to understand factors that predict the risk of heterosexual HIV-1 transmission. We investigated whether genital tract viral load (GTVL) in cervical-vaginal lavages (CVL) from HIV-1-positive women with moderately low CD4 T cell counts correlates with cytokine levels, antimicrobial concentrations, and intrinsic anti-HIV activity. CVL were collected from 19 HIV-1-positive women with moderately low CD4 T cell counts [mean 381 cells/mm(3) (227-536 cells/mm(3))]. None of the women was on antiretroviral therapy. The women were categorized into those with detectable GTVL or those with undetectable GTVL (detectable GTVL RNA levels > 400 copies/ml). Women were also categorized according to bacterial vaginosis (BV) status irrespective of GTVL. The TZM-bl assay was used to determine the presence of infectious virus and anti-HIV activity. Significantly higher levels of RANTES, Eotaxin, Fractalkine, IL-1α, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP1β, MIP1α, TNF-α, and GM-CSF were observed in women with detectable GTVL compared to women with undetectable GTVL. No significant differences were observed in the following cytokines and chemokines: G-CSF, IL-1RA, IL-8, and IP-10. GTVL did not correlate either with antimicrobials known to have anti-HIV activity or with the presence of infectious virus. BV status did not have a significant effect on anti-HIV activity. These findings further our understanding of the role of GTVL in determining the cytokine and chemokine milieu in the female reproductive tract."
17736,0.005,1.0000,"Interleukin-12, a cytokine with an important role against intracellular pathogens, promotes Th1 cell development, cellmediated cytotoxicity, and interferon-gamma production. We investigated the immunoregulatory role of IL-12 in 72 chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers, 33 of whom were monitored longitudinally during interferon-alpha treatment. Serum levels of IL-12 heterodimer, IL-12 p40 subunit, IL-4, and Th1 cytokines were determined by specific ELISAs, and hepatitis B core antigen-specific T cell response by a proliferation assay. Chronic HBV carriers had higher serum levels of IL-12 and IL-12 p40 in comparison with controls (P < 0.01), suggesting that IL-12 production is not impaired. The longitudinal analysis revealed a further substantial increase (> 2.5x baseline level) of bioactive IL-12 and Th1 cytokines in patients who cleared HBV and seroconverted to anti- hepatitis B e, unlike the 23 nonresponders with persistent HBV replication (P < 0.01). The IL-12 peak followed the peak of hepatocytolysis by 9.8+/-2.8 wk and occurred either before or simultaneously with hepatitis B e seroconversion. Hepatitis B core antigen-specific T cell proliferation closely correlated with hepatocytolysis and increased significantly in all patients (8 responders and 15 nonresponders) who developed hepatitis flare, irrespective of the virological outcome. These results provide in vivo evidence that IL-12 may have an important role for viral clearance in chronic HBV infection."

However, another study in Scotland questioned increased risk of development of NHL in patients with chronic HCV infection. A total of 2,162 patients admitted to 3 hospitals in Osaka, where the incidence of HCV-related hepatitis is highest in Japan, during the period from 1957 to 1997 were followed up from the date of diagnosis of chronic HCV-related hepatitis until 30 October 1997. Overall, 12,404.5 person-years of observation were accrued with a follow-up period ranging from 0.25 to 40.4 (average 5.74) years. NHL of the B-cell type developed in 4 patients. The interval between onset of chronic HCV and NHL ranged from 6 to 36 (median 13) years. Expected number of cases of NHL in the sex-, age- and calendar year-matched general population was 1.90, which gave a relative risk (RR) of 2.10 (95% confidence interval 0.57-5.38; p = 0.247). Taking the much higher RR for hepatocellular carcinoma among patients with HCV infection into account, chronic HCV infection was considered to be moderately associated with increased risk of NHL."
18763,0.005,1.0000,"Certain human leukocyte antigens, by presenting conserved immunogenic epitopes for T cell recognition, may, in part, account for the observed differences in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) susceptibility. To determine whether HLA polymorphism influences HIV-1 susceptibility, a longitudinal cohort of highly HIV-1-exposed female sex workers based in Nairobi, Kenya, was prospectively analyzed. Decreased HIV-1 infection risk was strongly associated with possession of a cluster of closely related HLA alleles (A2/6802 supertype; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-0.72; P=.0003). The alleles in this supertype are known in some cases to present the same peptide epitopes for T cell recognition. In addition, resistance to HIV-1 infection was independently associated with HLA DRB1*01 (IRR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.06-0.60; P=.0003), which suggests that anti-HIV-1 class II restricted CD4 effector mechanisms may play an important role in protecting against viral challenge. These data provide further evidence that resistance to HIV-1 infection in this cohort of sex workers is immunologically mediated."
2948,0.005,1.0000,"Recent ecological data demonstrate improving outcomes for HIV-infected people in sub-Saharan Africa. Recently, Uganda has experienced a resurgence in HIV incidence and prevalence, but trends in HIV-related deaths have not been well described. Data were collected through the Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment Outcomes (UARTO) Study, an observational longitudinal cohort of Ugandan adults initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) between 2005 and 2013. We calculated cumulative incidence of death within one year of ART initiation, and fit Poisson models with robust variance estimators to estimate the effect enrollment period on one-year risk of death and loss to follow-up. Of 760 persons in UARTO who started ART, 30 deaths occurred within one year of ART initiation (cumulative incidence 3.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.7-5.6%). Risk of death was highest for those starting ART in 2005 (13.0%, 95% CI 6.0-24.0%), decreased in 2006-2007 to 4% (95% CI 2.0-6.0%), and did not change thereafter ( P = 0.61). These results were robust to adjustment for age, sex, CD4 cell count, viral load, asset wealth, baseline depression, and body mass index. Here, we demonstrate that one-year cumulative incidence of death was high just after free ART rollout, decreased the following year, and remained low thereafter. Once established, ART programs in President's Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief-supported countries can maintain high quality care."
7629,0.005,1.0000,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) core antigen carries many epitopes relevant for B and T cell response that show aminoacid variation during viral infection. In a longitudinal analysis, sequential serum samples of 15 patients that suffered from chronic HBV infection were collected before, during, and after high-dose IFN-alpha treatment. The HBV preCore/Core (preC/C) sequence of the selected samples in each patient was determined and analysed for sequence variations compared to the pretreatment sample. The positions of HBV core aminoacid substitutions were assigned to immunodominant B, CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell epitopes. Seventy-five percent of all aminoacid substitutions were found within immunodominant T and B cell epitopes (12.5% were inside known HBV core mutation cluster regions) that show an increased number of clustered aminoacid substitutions during chronic HBV infection and overlap partially with the immunodominant epitopes. Only 12.5% of the detected core antigen aminoacid substitutions could not be assigned to any epitope or mutation cluster region. Stable HBV core antigen aminoacid substitutions, which were found between pretreatment sequence and the last sequence analysed during therapy, were found most frequently inside T helper cell epitopes. This longitudinal analysis of aminoacid substitutions inside the HBV core antigen in patients with chronic HBV infection shows that core aminoacid variations occur most frequently inside immunodominant HBV core epitopes, possibly due to an immuneselective pressure of the host against the virus. The data also suggest that stable HBV variants with aminoacid substitutions in immunodominant core epitopes can be selected during high-dose IFN-alpha therapy and persist after the end of treatment."
12232,0.005,1.0000,"In order to estimate hospital HIV prevalence, the economic impact of AIDS on health care and to assess the implications of HIV testing on clinical suspicion of AIDS this hospital based study was done at the government regional hospital of Kagera, Tanzania. Consecutive admissions were recruited into the study, and those consenting had a blood specimen taken, one portion of which was used to aid clinical diagnosis, while the other was tested anonymously for HIV antibodies using two ELISA systems. A short questionnaire was used to specify demographic characteristics, hospital ward of admission and diagnosis of each study subject. The overall age adjusted HIV-1 prevalence was 32.8% (N = 1422) and there was no significant difference in the age adjusted sex specific prevalence. The highest prevalence (53.3%) was found in the 25-34 years age group as well as in the gynaecological and medical wards (41.2% and 40.4%, respectively). The diagnostic category of clinical AIDS had a sensitivity of 11.3% and a specificity of 99.3%, indicating that only 11.3% of the HIV seropositives would have been HIV tested on clinical suspicion of AIDS. Similarly, the HIV-1 antibody sensitivity and specificity for tuberculosis were 5.9% and 97.9%, respectively. Patients who were HIV-1 infected were more likely to have a history of previous hospital admissions, RR = 1.34 (95% CI = 1.16-1.56), and were at an increased risk of developing tuberculosis, RR = 2.02 (95% CI = 1.50-2.70). The diagnostic categories with the highest HIV-1 infection prevalence were clinical AIDS (88.5%), herpes zoster and other HIV-1 skin manifestations combined (85.7%) and pulmonary tuberculosis (58.3%). In conclusion, the prevalence of HIV-1 infection was high among hospitalized patients in Bukoba hospital indicating that the major cause of illness leading to admission to the hospital may have been underlying HIV-1 infection. The findings also indicate that in a high HIV-1 prevalence area, testing for HIV infection on the basis of clinical suspicion of AIDS alone is not sufficient to provide rational care to the majority of HIV infected patients."
10192,0.005,1.0000,"Puerto Rico (PR) has a large and rapidly growing population of people living with HIV. However, relatively little behavioral or clinical research has been done in this population. As treatment for HIV increasingly moves into a chronic condition model, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the needs of this population so critical social and behavioral interventions can be developed, thus enabling the individual and community-level benefits of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment to be fully realized. To date, however, there has been very little research on the mental health needs of people living with HIV in PR, a fact that constrains intervention development and implementation. This paper describes data from a public sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV clinic study in the San Juan metropolitan area between April 2010 and December 2012 (n = 1185), roughly a third (36%) of whom are living with HIV. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, t-tests, and binary logistic regressions were used to assess associations between HIV status and a history of suicide attempt. The overall prevalence of a history of suicide attempt was 20.4%. No statistically significant relationship was found between a history of suicide attempt and being HIV positive, although people with HIV infection did evidence a higher prevalence of attempts than HIV-negative subjects (23.4% vs. 19.0%). Factors associated with having a history of suicide attempt within the overall sample included gender, current employment status, a lifetime history of drug use, and a lifetime history of sex work. Similar patterns were seen in the HIV-positive subsample. There was a nonsignificant trend toward increased risk for a post-diagnosis suicide attempt. These findings suggest that additional research on mental health risks among populations at risk for HIV in PR is needed."
7770,0.005,1.0000,"Past research suggests that as many as 50% of onward human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmissions occur during acute and recent HIV infection. It is clearly important to develop interventions which focus on this highly infectious stage of HIV infection to prevent further transmission in the risk networks of acutely and recently infected individuals. Project Protect tries to find recently and acutely infected individuals and prevents HIV transmission in their risk networks. Participants are recruited by community health outreach workers at community-based HIV testing sites and drug users' community venues, by coupon referrals and through referrals from AIDS clinics. When a network with acute/recent infection is identified, network members are interviewed about their risky behaviors, network information is collected, and blood is drawn for HIV testing. Participants are also educated and given prevention materials (condoms, syringes, educational materials); HIV-infected participants are referred to AIDS clinics and are assisted with access to care. Community alerts about elevated risk of HIV transmission are distributed within the risk networks of recently infected. Overall, 342 people were recruited to the project and screened for acute/recent HIV infection. Only six index cases of recent infection (2.3% of all people screened) were found through primary screening at voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) sites, but six cases of recent infection were found through contact tracing of these recently infected participants (7% of network members who came to the interview). Combining screening at VCT sites and contact tracing the number of recently infected people we located as compared to VCT screening alone. No adverse events were encountered. These first results provide evidence for the theory behind the intervention, i.e., in the risk networks of recently infected people there are other people with recent HIV infection and they can be successfully located without increasing stigma for project participants.

3459,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals who develop drug-resistant virus during antiretroviral therapy may derive benefit from continued treatment for two reasons. First, drug-resistant viruses can retain partial susceptibility to the drug combination. Second, therapy selects for drug-resistant viruses that may have reduced replication capacities relative to archived, drug-sensitive viruses. We developed a novel single-cell-level phenotypic assay that allows these two effects to be distinguished and compared quantitatively. Patient-derived gag-pol sequences were cloned into an HIV-1 reporter virus that expresses an endoplasmic reticulum-retained Env-green fluorescent protein fusion. Flow cytometric analysis of single-round infections allowed a quantitative analysis of viral replication over a 4-log dynamic range. The assay faithfully reproduced known in vivo drug interactions occurring at the level of target cells. Simultaneous analysis of single-round infections by wild-type and resistant viruses in the presence and absence of the relevant drug combination divided the benefit of continued nonsuppressive treatment into two additive components, residual virus susceptibility to the drug combination and selection for drug-resistant variants with diminished replication capacities. In some patients with drug resistance, the dominant circulating viruses retained significant susceptibility to the combination. However, in other cases, the dominant drug-resistant viruses showed no residual susceptibility to the combination but had a reduced replication capacity relative to the wild-type virus. In this case, simplification of the regimen might still allow adequate suppression of the wild-type virus. In a third pattern, the resistant viruses had no residual susceptibility to the relevant drug regimen but nevertheless had a replication capacity equivalent to that of wild-type virus. In such cases, there is no benefit to continued treatment. Thus, the ability to simultaneously analyze residual susceptibility and reduced replication capacity of drug-resistant viruses may provide a basis for rational therapeutic decisions in the setting of treatment failure."
15686,0.005,1.0000,"Epidemiological and clinical data indicate that genital ulcer disease (GUD) pathogens are associated with an increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) acquisition and/or transmission. Among them, genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) seems to play a relevant role. Indeed, the ability of HSV-2 to induce massive infiltration at the genital level of cells which are potential targets for HIV-1 infection may represent one of the mechanisms involved in this process. Here we show that infection of human primary macrophages (MDMs) by HSV-2 results in an increase of CCR5 expression levels on cell surface and allows higher efficiency of MDMs to support entry of R5 HIV-1 strains. This finding could strengthen, at the molecular level, the evidence linking HSV-2 infection to an increased susceptibility to HIV-1 acquisition."

SEN virus (SENV) was isolated from a HIV positive patient with intravenous drug use and post-transfusion hepatitis. SENV strains D and H seem to be relevant for the development of post-transfusion hepatitis. We compared the prevalence of SENV strains D and H and the viral load of SENV H in HIV-infected patients with healthy blood donors.

16673,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy is limited by the development of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) resistance mutations. Although resistance testing is recommended during therapy failure, little is known about the optimal time points for testing or its impact on treatment. In this study, we investigated HIV polymorphisms and mutations and assessed their influence on the outcome of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We focused on viral load and CD4+ cell counts as the most important parameters for therapy response. Resistance mutations were present in 19% of all patients prior to antiretroviral treatment. Mutations causing direct antiretroviral drug resistance were observed in 10%. Analyzing therapy response, we found a significant correlation between resistance mutations and impaired CD4+ cell recovery six months after the initiation of antiretroviral treatment. Lower CD4+ cell counts were also observed in a subgroup of patients infected with a virus presenting mutations that directly lowered drug susceptibility."
15391,0.005,1.0000,"Viable tissue sections and isolated cell cultures from the human fallopian tube, uterus, cervix, and vaginal mucosa were examined for susceptibility to infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We examined infectivity by using the monocytotropic strain HIV-1(JR-FL) and several primary isolates of HIV-1 obtained from infected neonates. HIV-1 infection was measured by p24 production in short-term culture and by immunofluorescence detection of HIV-1 Nef and p24 proteins by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Three-color immunofluorescence was used to phenotype HIV-infected cells within tissue sections from each site. Our findings indicate that epithelial, stromal, and dendritic cells and cells with CD14+ CD4+, CD14-CD4-, and CD4+ CD14- phenotypes from the female reproductive tract are infectable with HIV-1. Of importance is the finding that tissues from the upper reproductive tract are susceptible to infection with HIV-1. Moreover, tissue samples from women in all stages of the menstrual cycle, including postmenopausal women (inactive), could be infected with HIV-1. Female reproductive tract cells required a minimum of 60 min of exposure to HIV-1 in order for infection to occur, in contrast to peripheral blood lymphocytes, which became infected after being exposed to HIV-1 for only 1 min. These findings demonstrate that HIV-1 can infect cells and tissues from different sites within the female reproductive tract and suggest that multiple cell types, including epithelial cells, may be targets for the initial infection by HIV-1."
15750,0.005,1.0000,"As antiretroviral therapy continues to scale-up in developing countries, there is concern that high levels of HIV drug resistance to antiretroviral drugs will occur. Here we describe rates of emergence of HIV-1 drug resistance and factors associated with their occurrence among adults who received antiretroviral therapy (ART) for >1 year through the Côte d'Ivoire national drug access program from 1998 to 2003. To detect genotypic drug resistance, we sequenced all 1- and 2-year specimens with detectable HIV RNA viral load. To assess factors associated with emerging drug resistance, we used log normal regression with interval censoring, including covariates in the model for self-reported drug adherence, CD4 cell count, and HIV viral load at therapy initiation, and observed changes in these measures, type of prescribed ART drugs, diagnoses of opportunistic illness, and demographic characteristics. An estimated 14.2% [95% confidence limits (CL) 11.7, 16.9] and 26.6% (95% CL 22.7, 30.8) of patients developed primary drug-resistant mutations within 1 year and 2 years after initiation of therapy, respectively. Factors associated with drug resistance included drug nonadherence, partial or lack of viral suppression, higher viral load or lower CD4 at initiation of therapy, and initiation of ART with what is now considered substandard dual combination therapy. Our results demonstrate the need to strengthen adherence and continuity in treatment programs in order to avoid interruption of ART drugs. Treatment programs should pay attention to indicators of emerging drug resistance: incomplete or lesser decreases in viral load or increases in CD4 cell counts following initiation of therapy, and the occurrence of AIDS opportunistic illnesses."
12615,0.005,1.0000,"A national survey of 925 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Australia conducted in the second half of 1997 showed that the proportion of HIV-positive women (61%) reporting they currently used antiretroviral treatment was significantly lower than that of men (79%). Women (37%) were also significantly less likely than men (59%) to report that they believe new treatments have brought hope and better prospects for PLWHA. Thirteen women and 63 men who completed the survey also participated in an in-depth interview which further explored the use of, and attitudes to, antiretroviral drugs for HIV/AIDS and their impact on personal relationships and work-related issues. Taken together, the survey and interview data suggest that male PLWHA have positive albeit qualified views about antiretrovirals and believe their health and future prospects have been improved by advances in treatments. In contrast, female PLWHA were sceptical about treatments and were unwilling to link their future prospects to the outcomes of antiretroviral therapy. Multivariate analysis of the correlates of attitudes to treatments revealed gender to be a significant independent predictor of more positive attitudes. These results are important considerations for health care workers in ensuring that HIV treatment services become more acceptable to HIV-positive women."
8190,0.005,1.0000,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at increased risk for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 2006, 57% of new HIV infections in the United States occurred among MSM. To estimate and monitor risk behaviors, CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system (NHBS) collects data from metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) using an anonymous cross-sectional interview of men at venues where MSM congregate, such as bars, clubs, and social organizations. This report summarizes NHBS data from 2008, which indicated that, of 8,153 MSM interviewed and tested in the 21 MSAs participating in NHBS that year, HIV prevalence was 19%, with non-Hispanic blacks having the highest prevalence (28%), followed by Hispanics (18%), non-Hispanic whites (16%), and persons who were multiracial or of other race (17%). Of those who were infected, 44% were unaware of their infection. Men who know their current HIV infection status can be linked to appropriate medical care and prevention services. Once linked to prevention services, men can learn ways to avoid transmitting the virus to others. Young MSM (aged 18--29 years) (63%) and minority MSM (other than non-Hispanic white) (54%) were more likely to be unaware of their HIV infection. Efforts to ensure at least annual HIV testing for MSM should be strengthened, and HIV testing and prevention programs should increase their efforts to reach young and minority MSM."
1788,0.005,1.0000,"Our objective was to review systematically studies of interventions to prevent transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in heterosexual men. Of 1157 studies identified through database and hand searching, 27 met our inclusion criteria. Most interventions targeted specific groups of men (eg, those attending STI clinics) rather than general populations. Few were conducted with men alone, and most focused on behavioral and social psychological rather than morbidity outcomes. Of 8 interventions designed to reduce STI incidence (including HIV), 5 were successful, 2 were unsuccessful, and 1 had equivocal results. Of the 5 successful interventions, 1 was carried out in the workplace, 1 in the military, and 3 in STI clinics.They included on-site individual counseling and HIV testing, mass communications regarding risk reduction, and multiple-component motivation and skills education in STI clinics. More high-quality research into the effectiveness of interventions targeting heterosexual men is needed, especially methodologically sound trials to evaluate effects on morbidity."
5430,0.005,1.0000,"In the context of HIV, the initiation of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been found to increase the risk of dyslipidemia in HIV-infected individuals, and dyslipidemia has been found to be a risk factor for kidney disease in the general population. Therefore, we examined changes in lipid profiles in HIV-infected men following ART initiation and the association with future kidney dysfunction. HIV-infected men from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study initiating ART between December 31, 1995 and September 30, 2011 with measured lipid and serum creatinine values pre-ART and post-ART were selected. The associations between changes in total cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein following ART initiation and the estimated change in glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over time were assessed using piecewise linear mixed effects models. There were 365 HIV-infected men who contributed to the analysis. In the adjusted models, at 3 years post-ART, those with changes in total cholesterol >50 mg/dl had an average decrease in eGFR of 2.6 ml/min/1.73 m(2) per year (p<0.001) and at 5 years post-ART, the average decrease was 2.4 ml/min/1.73 m(2) per year (p=0.008). This decline contrasted with the estimates for those with changes in total cholesterol ≤ 50 mg/dl: 1.4 ml/min/1.73 m(2) decrease per year (p<0.001) and 0.1 ml/min/1.73 m(2) decrease per year (p=0.594) for the same time periods, respectively. Large decreases in high-density lipoprotein (a decline of greater than 5 mg/dl) were not associated with declines in eGFR. These results indicate that large ART-related increases in total cholesterol may be a risk factor for kidney function decline in HIV-infected men. Should these results be generalizable to the broader HIV population, monitoring cholesterol changes following the initiation of ART may be important in identifying HIV-infected persons at risk for kidney disease."
4585,0.005,1.0000,"Hyperbilirubinaemia with or without jaundice is one of the side effects of atazanavir boosted with low-dose ritonavir (ATV/rit) related to the drug plasma levels, as a result of its metabolism by UGT1A1 - uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase. Genotyping for UGT1A1*28 before initiation of antiretroviral therapy containing atazanavir may aid in identifying individuals at risk of hyperbilirubinaemia. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of the UGTA1A1*28 polymorphism in HIV-infected individuals in Greece and to determine its potential association with hyperbilirubinaemia in patients receiving ATV/rit. The prevalence of the UGTA1A1*28 variant was estimated in 79 HIV-infected patients prior to the administration of the first-line treatment. The UGTA1A1*28 variant was detected in 46 out of 79 individuals (58.2%). Antiretroviral therapy was administered to 64/79 patients (81%). Among them, 26/64 (40.6%) received ATV/rit. Of the ATV/rit-treated patients, 14 were found to be carriers of the UGT1A1*28 variant (54%), and maximum serum bilirubin levels were significantly higher in the carrier population (4.71 vs. 2.69 mg/dL, p = 0.026). In 50% of the population, maximum levels were recorded in the first month of follow-up. Although carriage of UGT1A1 is linked with the development of hyperbilirubinaemia, the implementation of a pharmacogenomic approach in clinical practice cannot yet be recommended as a standard of care.

4752,0.005,1.0000,"We examined risk factors associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among opioid-dependent patients enrolled into medication-assisted therapy (buprenorphine or methadone) to determine factors affecting chronic infection. Patients (N = 1039) were randomized as part of a larger, multisite clinical trial sponsored by the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network assessing liver function. HCV status was first assessed with an antibody screen; if positive, then current infection was determined with an antigen screen testing for detectable virus. Patients were classified as HCV negative, HCV positive but have cleared the virus, or as having chronic HCV. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine demographic and behavioral correlates of the three groups. Thirty-four percent of patients were classified with chronic infection and 14% had evidence of prior infection with apparent clearing of the virus. Chronic infection was associated with recent injection drug use and cocaine use. Chronic HCV infection was also associated with being older and Hispanic. Age, ethnicity, and current drug use increase the likelihood of being chronically infected with HCV. Strategies targeting high risk subgroups can aid in preventing further disease escalation."
1730,0.005,1.0000,"The current pandemic of sexually transmitted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has created an urgent need for a new type of microbicide, one that is both a spermicide and a virucide. In a systematic effort to identify a non-detergent-type antiviral spermicide, we have rationally designed and synthesized a series of cyclohexenyl thiourea (CHET) nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) with sperm-immobilizing activity (SIA). To gain further insight into the structural requirements for the optimal activity of these dual-function NNIs, we compared the effects of thiazolyl, benzothiazolyl, and pyridyl ring substitutions and functionalization with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups as well as the importance of thiourea and urea moieties of 15 heterocyclic ring-substituted NNIs. RT activity and p24 antigen production in HIV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as markers of viral replication. Computer-assisted sperm analysis was used for evaluating SIA of CHET compounds. The rabbit model was used for evaluation of in vivo mucosal toxicity and contraceptive activity of the lead NNIs. Three CHET-NNIs with a bromo, chloro, or methyl substitution at the 5 position of the pyridyl ring exhibited potent anti-HIV activity at nanomolar concentrations (IC(50) = 3-5 nM) and SIA at micromolar concentrations (EC(50) = 45-96 micro M). The dual-function CHET-NNIs were potent inhibitors of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains with genotypic and phenotypic NNI resistance. Upon substitution of the sulfur atom of the thiourea moiety with an oxygen atom, the most striking difference noted was a 38-fold reduction in time required for 50% sperm immobilization (T(1/2)). A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis was used in deriving regression equations between 20 physicochemical properties and SIA of NNIs. QSAR analysis showed that the T(1/2) values positively correlated with values for molecular refractivity (r = 0.88), hydrophobicity (r = 0.72), atomic polarizability (r = 0.70), and principal moment of inertia (r = 0.63) of spermicidal NNIs. A stepwise multiple regression model to describe the relationship of T(1/2) values with these four regressors provided excellent predictability (r = 0.93). Exposure of semen to thiourea/urea NNIs either alone or in combination at the time of artificial insemination led to marked or complete inhibition of pregnancy in rabbits as assessed by the number of embryo implants versus corpora lutea on Day 8 of pregnancy. Repeated intravaginal application of a gel-microemulsion with and without 0.5%, 1%, and 2% CHET-NNI or its urea analog either alone or in combination did not induce mucosal toxicity. We hypothesize that the gain of spermicidal function by CHET-NNIs is due to their metabolic oxidation to urea analogs by sperm. Three reaction pathways are discussed. The extremely rapid SIA of the urea analog as well as the broad-spectrum anti-HIV activity of spermicidal CHET-NNIs together with their lack of mucosal toxicity and the marked ability to reduce in vivo fertility is particularly useful for the clinical development of a dual-function spermicidal microbicide. The cyclohexenyl pyridyl NNIs, especially N-[2-(1-cyclohexenyl)ethyl] N'-[2-(5-bromopyridyl)]-thiourea in combination with the urea analog, show unique clinical potential as anti-HIV spermicides aimed at curbing the sexual transmission of multidrug-resistant HIV-1 while providing effective fertility control for women."

In this study we have analyzed the relationship between serum beta 2-microglobulin levels of patients at different stages of the disease and serological and immunological parameters commonly used for monitoring the infection. The investigation was performed on 150 patients and 30 controls during the period from March 1989 to March 1990. At that time, 30 patients had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or its related complex and 120 had persistent generalized lymphadenopathy or were asymptomatic. Thirty-nine antibody-negative subjects, belonging to a high-risk group for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, were used as controls. All patients had normal renal function. There was a significant relationship between increased serum beta 2-microglobulin levels and the presence of p24 antigen, a decrease in the total number of lymphocytes (less than or equal to 1500/mm3) and a decrease in CD4+ T lymphocytes (less than or equal to 200/mm3). No significant relationship between serum beta 2-microglobulin levels and CD3+ T lymphocytes was found."
4374,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence and the characteristics of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) in 161 HIV-positive patients were studied. HCV seroprevalence was determined by enzyme immunoassay and recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA). Two different reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods were also used to test the HCV-seropositive samples and 50 EIA-negative sera used as controls. The RNA HCV-positive sera were genotyped by the LiPA procedure. Associations of HCV status with demographic characteristics and risk factors were assessed by chi 2 and Fisher's exact tests. The seroprevalence of HCV was 34.2% with a significant difference between blood and sexual exposure risk groups (60.6% vs. 13.6%, respectively; P < 0.0001). Thirty-six of the 55 anti-HCV-positive sera were also positive for HCV RNA, and PCR detected HCV RNA in 8 HCV-seronegative patients. Various RIBA profiles were found and all sera were positive for antibodies to the c33 protein. A proportion of sera had elevated levels of transaminase activity (37.2%), and abnormal liver function as associated with HCV infection. Forty-two samples were genotyped and five genotypes and subtypes of the HCV virus were detected. Genotype 1a was the most frequent in this cohort, although genotype 1b is generally more common in France. The majority (94.1%) of the patients with genotype 1a had a history of blood exposure, which may account for the difference."
16984,0.005,1.0000,"HIV involvement of the CNS continues to be a significant problem despite successful use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Drugs of abuse can act in concert with HIV proteins to damage glia and neurons, worsening the neurotoxicity caused by HIV alone. Methamphetamine (METH) is a highly addictive psychostimulant drug, abuse of which has reached epidemic proportions and is associated with high-risk sexual behavior, increased HIV transmission, and development of drug resistance. HIV infection and METH dependence can have synergistic pathological effects, with preferential involvement of frontostriatal circuits. At the molecular level, epigenetic alterations have been reported for both HIV-1 infection and drug abuse, but the neuropathological pathways triggered by their combined effects are less known. We investigated epigenetic changes in the brain associated with HIV and METH. We analyzed postmortem frontal cortex tissue from 27 HIV seropositive individuals, 13 of which had a history of METH dependence, in comparison to 14 cases who never used METH. We detected changes in the expression of DNMT1, at mRNA and protein levels, that resulted in the increase of global DNA methylation. Genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation in a subset of cases, showed differential methylation on genes related to neurodegeneration; dopamine metabolism and transport; and oxidative phosphorylation. We provide evidence for the synergy of HIV and METH dependence on the patterns of DNA methylation on the host brain, which results in a distinctive landscape for the comorbid condition. Importantly, we identified new epigenetic targets that might aid in understanding the aggravated neurodegenerative, cognitive, motor and behavioral symptoms observed in persons living with HIV and addictions.

5186,0.005,1.0000,"The primary objective of this study was to measure atazanavir-ritonavir and tenofovir pharmacokinetics when the drugs were used in combination in young adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV-infected subjects > or =18 to <25 years old receiving (> or =28 days) 300/100 mg atazanavir-ritonavir plus 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) plus one or more other nucleoside analogs underwent intensive 24-h pharmacokinetic studies following a light meal. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained at 1, 4, and 24 h postdose for quantification of intracellular tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations. Twenty-two subjects were eligible for analyses. The geometric mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) atazanavir area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC(0-24)), maximum concentration of drug in serum (C(max)), concentration at 24 h postdose (C(24)), and total apparent oral clearance (CL/F) values were 35,971 ng x hr/ml (30,853 to 41,898), 3,504 ng/ml (2,978 to 4,105), 578 ng/ml (474 to 704), and 8.3 liter/hr (7.2 to 9.7), respectively. The geometric mean (95% CI) tenofovir AUC(0-24), C(max), C(24), and CL/F values were 2,762 ng.hr/ml (2,392 to 3,041), 254 ng/ml (221 to 292), 60 ng/ml (52 to 68), and 49.2 liter/hr (43.8 to 55.3), respectively. Body weight was significantly predictive of CL/F for all three drugs. For every 10-kg increase in weight, there was a 10%, 14.8%, and 6.8% increase in the atazanavir, ritonavir, and tenofovir CL/F, respectively (P < or = 0.01). Renal function was predictive of tenofovir CL/F. For every 10 ml/min increase in creatinine clearance, there was a 4.6% increase in tenofovir CL/F (P < 0.0001). The geometric mean (95% CI) TFV-DP concentrations at 1, 4, and 24 h postdose were 96.4 (71.5 to 130), 93.3 (68 to 130), and 92.7 (70 to 123) fmol/million cells. There was an association between renal function, tenofovir AUC, and tenofovir C(max) and intracellular TFV-DP concentrations, although none of these associations reached statistical significance. In these HIV-infected young adults treated with atazanavir-ritonavir plus TDF, the atazanavir AUC was similar to those of older adults treated with the combination. Based on data for healthy volunteers, a higher tenofovir AUC may have been expected, but was not seen in these subjects. This might be due to faster tenofovir CL/F because of higher creatinine clearance in this age group. Additional studies of the exposure-response relationships of this regimen in children, adolescents, and adults would advance our knowledge of its pharmacodynamic properties."

To date, no study has precisely investigated the association of current and past HBV infection with the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the Chinese population. Therefore, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study in southwestern China to clarify this issue. A total of 631 newly ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD cases and 2357 controls were selected from 123 243 consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary-care hospital between January 2015 and December 2016. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A propensity score was developed for adjustment and matching. Subgroup analysis was conducted to identify potential effect modifiers. Current and past HBV infection had an overall prevalence of 9.7% and 55.2%, respectively. In the fully adjusted model, current HBV infection was associated with a decreased risk of NAFLD (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.42-0.95). A similar inverse association was observed in both propensity-score-adjusted (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.40-0.86) and propensity-score-matched analyses (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.40-0.92).The inverse association was stronger in patients with hypertension than in those without (P"

Developing a host-oriented antiviral strategy capable of targeting the biomolecules that are directly or indirectly required for viral replication may provide advantages over traditional virus-centric approaches. We used quantitative proteomics by SWATH-MS in conjunction with bioinformatic analyses to identify host proteins, with an emphasis on nucleic acid binding and regulatory proteins, which could serve as candidates in the development of host-oriented antiretroviral strategies. Using SWATH-MS, we identified and quantified the expression of 3608 proteins in uninfected and HIV-1-infected monocyte-derived macrophages. Of these 3608 proteins, 420 were significantly altered upon HIV-1 infection. Bioinformatic analyses revealed functional enrichment for RNA binding and processing as well as transcription regulation. Our findings highlight a novel subset of proteins and processes that are involved in the host response to HIV-1 infection. In addition, we provide an original and transparent methodology for the analysis of label-free quantitative proteomics data generated by SWATH-MS that can be readily adapted to other biological systems.

15020,0.005,1.0000,"Natural killer (NK) cells are a functionally defined subset of non-T, non-B lymphocytes of bone marrow origin, which induce lysis of selected target cells, including neoplastic and virus-infected cells. The NK cell function provides an important mechanism of primary defence against viruses in vivo, as demonstrated by the occurrence of multiple herpesvirus infections in patients congenitally lacking NK cells. Here we show that functionally competent CD3- NK clones can be productively infected by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), a T-lymphotropic DNA virus that may play a role in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and in the chronic fatigue syndrome, two disorders associated with a defective NK cell activity. The infection is cytopathic and induces de novo expression of CD4, an antigen not expressed within the NK lineage, thereby predisposing NK cells to infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). These results provide evidence that a herpesvirus can directly target and kill NK cells, a potential strategy to suppress the natural anti-viral immunity of the host."

Over the last two decades, China has made great progress on the prevention of HBV transmission through national vaccination programs. Zero transmission from mother to infant has been proposed as the current goal. Available anti-HBV therapy is efficacious in suppressing HBV replication; however, it fails to completely cure patients with chronic hepatitis B and even requires lifelong treatment. To reduce the costs and improve the efficacy, several trials have been recently conducted in China to optimize the current anti-HBV managements. Novel biomarkers were identified to predict treatment outcomes, and new promising treatment strategies were developed. Reports also indicate that coinfections of HBV with other hepatotropic viruses and human immunodeficiency virus are common in China and cause severe liver diseases, which should be recognized early and treated properly.

There are >250 million people chronically infected with HBV, and these chronic carriers are at high risk of developing end-stage liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) usually acquire the virus perinatally, while most patients infected during adulthood develop acute hepatitis B (AHB), which usually results in viral clearance. HBV infection is noncytopathic, and liver injury is mostly contributed by host immune responses. The virus is stealthy, since the infection rarely induces type I interferon response in the early phase. In AHB, viral infection is detected and restrained by the innate immune response, which is followed by a strong and robust adaptive immune response and accompanied by viral clearance. In patients with CHB, both innate and adaptive immune responses are weak and thus rarely lead to viral clearance. Interferon α and nucleos(t)ide analogues are 2 classes of approved antiviral therapies. The former treatment activates nature killer (NK) cells and NK T cells, which partially enhances the innate immune response, while the later treatment suppresses viral replication by inhibiting reverse transcriptase, which may restore the HBV-specific adaptive immune response. However, single or combined treatment are still far from achieving seroclearance of HBV surface antigen. Although the treatment response is unsatisfactory in current clinical trials using several immunomodulators for boosting antiviral immunity, immunotherapy that is able to induce immune surveillance is still the most promising modality for HBV cure in the future."
10743,0.005,1.0000,"Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) are widely used in anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HBV) therapy for effective inhibition of HBV replication. However, HBV resistance to NAs has emerged, resulting in virus reactivation and disease recurrence. Data on the current dynamics of HBV resistance are still rare in China. This study analysed 4491 plasma samples with HBV primary genotypic resistance mutations representative of the general HBV resistance situation in northern China from 2009-2016. We found that entecavir (ETV), representing 57.6% (12 713/22 060) of NA users in North China in 2016, has become the major NA for treating Chinese patients infected with HBV. Despite >50% of M204I/V±L180M among all HBV resistance cases annually and extensive exposure of patients to lamivudine (LAM), telbivudine (LdT) and adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), ETV resistance also showed a dramatically increased incidence, which rose to 17.1% in 2016. Moreover, A181T/V, ETV resistance mutations and multidrug resistance mutations were found more frequently in HBV genotype C compared with genotype B (21.2% vs. 8.5%, 12.4% vs. 7.9% and 5.9% vs. 3.0%, respectively), whereas M204I and N236T were more predominant in genotype B than genotype C (40.3% vs. 20.8% and 11.3% vs. 1.8%, respectively). In conclusion, we report the dynamic changes of HBV NA resistance mutation patterns and the current NA usage profile for anti-HBV treatment in North China over the past 8 years. These data provide valuable information on HBV NA resistance that is an important reference for clinicians to devise more effective treatment regimens for individual patients."
153,0.005,1.0000,"Macrophages are important target cells for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type I (HIV-1) in vivo. Several studies have assessed the molecular biology of the virus in this cell type, and a number of differences towards HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells have been described. There is a broad consensus that macrophages resist HIV-1 infection much better than CD4+ T cells. Among other reasons, this is due to the presence of the recently identified host cell restriction factor SamHD1, which is strongly expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage. Furthermore, macrophages produce and release relatively low amounts of infectious HIV-1 and are less sensitive to viral cytotoxicity in comparison to CD4+ T cells. Nevertheless, macrophages play a crucial role in the different phases of HIV-1 infection. In this review, we summarize and discuss the significance of macrophages for HIV-1 transmission, the acute and chronic phases of HIV-1 infection, the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-associated diseases, including neurocognitive disorders. We propose that interaction of HIV-1 with macrophages is crucial during all stages of HIV-1 infection. Thus, long-term successful treatment of HIV-1 infected individuals requires potent strategies to prevent HIV-1 from entering and persisting in these cells."
13794,0.005,1.0000,"Recent data highlighted the association of the macrophage activation marker CD163 with histological inflammation and fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of successful antiviral treatment and IL28B genotypes on macrophage activation reflected by CD163 levels in HCV infected patients. In a retrospective cohort study, serum sCD163 levels were correlated with results of liver histopathology, IL28B genotyping and clinical parameters in 329 patients with HCV infection, 15 healthy controls and in 161 patients who achieved a sustained virologic response after antiviral treatment. sCD163 levels were significantly higher in patients with chronic HCV infection in comparison to healthy controls (5202 vs 896 ng/mL, P < 0.001). In the multivariate logistic regression analyses, sCD163 was independently associated with histologically determined inflammation (P = 0.043) but not with fibrosis (P = 0.091). sCD163 dropped significantly after successful antiviral treatment in comparison to baseline values (5202 vs 3093 ng/mL, P < 0.001). In the univariate analyses, sCD163 was significantly associated with IL28B genotype (C/C vs C/T+T/T) with higher values in the C/C group (6098 vs 4812 ng/mL, P = 0.003). In the multivariate logistic regression model, sCD163 levels were significantly associated with IL28B genotype (P = 0.003) and sustained virologic response (SVR) (P < 0.001). Our data support the association of activated liver macrophages with hepatic necroinflammation in chronic HCV infection as sCD163 levels drop rapidly after SVR. The irresponsiveness of IL28B minor genotypes to interferon might be related to a lower level of macrophage activation in these patients. "

It is more stable than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in the plasma and can provide similar efficacy with lower circulating concentration in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Areas covered: This synopsis will review the current anti-HBV standard practice and the changing epidemiology of CHB, specifically the controversies surrounding the renal and bone safety associated with TDF use in the context of an aging CHB population. We will review data from phase 3 registration trials, which demonstrated TAF was not inferior to TDF in antiviral efficacy for both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients, while associated with less reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate and bone mineral density. Expert commentary: Current data supports the use of TAF as one of the first-line antiviral agents for general CHB patients without hepatic decompensation. However, more real-world data with long-term observation are needed to better define the role of TAF among other oral regimens. Additional studies are also needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAF in special populations such as those with impaired hepatic function, existing impaired renal and/or bone function, and in pregnant women."
2298,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of different genotypes of Hepatitis C virus may vary between geographic areas and it is possible that various genotypes have different pathogenic characteristics. Therefore, 90 consecutive Italian patients anti-Hepatitis C Virus positive with a broad spectrum of chronic liver disease, have been analysed to observe prevalence of various genotypes of Hepatitis C Virus. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction with a set of nested biotinylated primers, located in 5'UTR region. Genotype 1b and genotype 2a were the most commonly encountered (respectively, 50% and 37%) whereas other genotypes were rare. The unexpected high prevalence of genotype 2a allowed direct comparison of clinical characteristics and response to therapy between patients with genotype 2a and those with 1b. Genotype 1b was more prevalent than 2a in patients over 60 years (29 vs 12) and in those with more severe liver disease (34 vs 16). In a univariate analysis, genotype 2a was associated with less severe liver disease (p = 0.02) and younger age (p = 0.018), in comparison with genotype 1b. Patients with genotype 2a responded to interferon alpha therapy better than those with 1b (p = 0.007). In a multivariate analysis, only younger age was associated with genotype 2a. Genotype 2a (in comparison with 1b) and absence of cirrhosis were independent predictors of response to interferon alpha. In conclusion, genotype 2a is playing an emerging role in younger Italian patients and seems more sensitive than 1b to interferon alpha therapy."
12747,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is strongly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the viral HBx protein plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of liver tumors. Because the protooncogene pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (PTTG1) is overexpressed in HCC, we investigated the regulation of this protein by HBx. We analyzed PTTG1 expression levels in liver biopsies from patients chronically infected with HBV, presenting different disease stages, and from HBx transgenic mice. PTTG1 was undetectable in biopsies from chronic hepatitis B patients or from normal mouse livers. In contrast, hyperplastic livers from transgenic mice and biopsies from patients with cirrhosis, presented PTTG1 expression which was found mainly in HBx-expressing hepatocytes. PTTG1 staining was further increased in HCC specimens. Experiments in vitro revealed that HBx induced a marked accumulation of PTTG1 protein without affecting its messenger RNA levels. HBx expression promoted the inhibition of PTTG1 ubiquitination, which in turn impaired its degradation by the proteasome. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the interaction between PTTG1 and the Skp1-Cul1-F-box ubiquitin ligase complex (SCF) was partially disrupted, possibly through a mechanism involving protein-protein interactions of HBx with PTTG1 and/or SCF. Furthermore, confocal analysis revealed that HBx colocalized with PTTG1 and Cul1. We propose that HBx promotes an abnormal accumulation of PTTG1, which may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of HBV-related pathogenesis of progressive liver disease leading to HCC development."
3142,0.005,1.0000,"Advances in HIV treatment have generated optimistic beliefs about HIV transmission risk and sexually transmitted infection vulnerability, which can influence motivation to practice safer sex. This study sought to better understand the relationships between these beliefs and different types of sexual risk behavior. A second objective was to determine the association between treatment adherence and sexual risk behaviors. Data collected from 842 HIV-positive men who have sex with men on treatment were examined. Eleven questions measured beliefs regarding HIV transmission risk and vulnerability to other infections or negative health outcomes. The main outcomes were concordant and discordant unprotected anal sex with main and non-main male partners. Thirty-four percent reported concordant and 41% reported discordant unprotected anal sex in the past three months: 26% reported discordant insertive unprotected anal sex. In all multivariate logistic regression models predicting sexual risk behaviors, at least one belief item remained statistically significant. Different patterns of associations between beliefs and sexual risk were observed across partner type and serostatus. Compared to transmission risk beliefs, more vulnerability beliefs were associated with sexual risk. Missing at least one treatment dose in the past month was associated with concordant and discordant sexual risk with non-main partners, while intentionally missing a dose was associated with only discordant risk with non-main partners. Post hoc moderator analysis explored potential interaction between beliefs and adherence. The belief that a low viral load lowers transmission risk was positively associated with discordant sex with non-main partners only among those who missed a dose intentionally. These results underscore the complex relationship between HIV transmission risk and vulnerability beliefs and sexual behavior with different types of partners. Prevention programs should carefully consider how to craft and tailor messages about medical advances while at the same time reinforcing the need for continued sexual safety."
5580,0.005,1.0000,"CD8 T cells play a major role in antiviral immune responses. Their importance for progression to chronic hepatitis C and response to treatment are still unclear. To address these issues, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific CD8 T-cell responses were monitored, at the single-cell level, using HLA class I pentamers specific for HCV core and HCV NS3 epitopes, in 23 chronically infected patients during treatment with pegylated alpha interferon and ribavirin. Patients who presented a sustained-response to therapy had stronger HCV-specific CD8 T-cell responses at all time points studied. Moreover, there were clear differences in the phenotypes of these cells during therapy: in responder patients, terminally differentiated effector cells increased more rapidly, and their frequency was always higher than in nonresponder patients. Sustained-responder patients also showed a higher frequency of HCV-specific CD8 T cells producing cytotoxic factors. Overall, a late and inefficient differentiation process of HCV-specific CD8 T cells might be associated with lack of response to treatment. A better knowledge of the mechanisms underlying this impairment may be important for the development of new therapeutic strategies to maintain, restore, or increase CD8 T-cell effectiveness in chronic HCV infection."
14091,0.005,1.0000,"Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is an immunomodulatory cytokine that promotes cellular immunity. Pre-clinical data suggest that IL-12 inhibits hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication by stimulating interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production. We investigated whether a combination treatment with lamivudine plus recombinant human interleukin-12 (rhIL-12) will result in a greater and prolonged suppression of HBV replication in comparison with lamivudine monotherapy. Fifteen patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B were randomized to receive either lamivudine alone for 24 weeks (group 1); combination of lamivudine for 16 weeks and rhIL-12 (200 ng/kg twice weekly), starting 4 weeks after initiation of lamivudine, for 20 weeks (group 2), or the same schedule as for group 2, with lamivudine and a higher dose of rhIL-12 (500 ng/kg, group 3). Serum HBV DNA levels, T-cell proliferation, frequency of virus-specific T-cells, and IFN-gamma production were evaluated serially during and 24 weeks posttreatment. Lamivudine plus rhIL-12/500 showed greater antiviral activity than lamivudine monotherapy. However, after stopping lamivudine in groups 2 and 3, serum HBV DNA increased significantly despite continuing rhIL-12 administration. Lamivudine plus rhIL-12 treatment was associated with a greater increase in virus-specific T-cell reactivity, IFN-gamma production, and an inverse correlation between the frequency of IFN-gamma-producing CD4+ T-cells and viremia. The T-cell proliferative response to HBcAg did not differ between the three groups. In conclusion, the addition of IL-12 to lamivudine enhances T-cell reactivity to HBV and IFN-gamma production. However, IL-12 does not abolish HBV replication in HBeAg-positive patients and does not maintain inhibition of HBV replication after lamivudine withdrawal."
15473,0.005,1.0000,"The future of patients with chronic hepatitis (HC) due to B virus depends above all on the tendency of the interaction between viral activity and immune response. Viral activity (replication) (RV) can be expressed in these patients by two variants: a) ""complete"" or ""early"", associated with the presence in serum of HBsAg, HBeAg, and significant DNA polymerase activity, and b) ""incomplete"" or ""late"", in which anti-HBe is found in serum and there are scant or no histopathologic changes (""healthy carriers"" in some cases). In prolonged infections viral replication declines gradually, although viral capsid protein continues to be synthesized and DNA-HBV is integrated into the genome. Viral replication per se does not condition the histologic damage (DH) expressive of liver cirrhosis with HBV (HCB). Other publications take a different view of this problem. The increase in viral replication often is proportional to a rise in serum GPT (an expression of histologic damage), but viral replication is not always associated with a progressive disease course. The immune defense leads to cytolysis and subsequent elimination of the HB virus. Some patients with high HBsAg levels have little active forms of liver cirrhosis; the DNA-HBV integrated would be capable of producing HBsAg but not HBcAg. It is precisely this that induces the response of cytotoxic T lymphocytes at the level of the hepatocyte surface. The presence in serum of anti-HBe IgM would be related to the expression of HBcAg on the hepatocyte membrane and/or the liberation of HBcAg particles by lysed hepatocytes. The relationship between the degree of histologic damage and serum aminotransferase levels is better established."
5552,0.005,1.0000,"In treating hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, the rapid reselection of resistance-associated variants (RAVs) is well known in patients with repeated exposure to the same class of antiviral agents. For chronic hepatitis C patients who have experienced virologic failure with direct-acting antiviral drugs, the potential for the reselection of persistent RAVs is unknown. Nine patients who received 14 days of telaprevir monotherapy were retreated with telaprevir-based triple therapy 4.3 to 5.7 years later. In four patients with virologic failure with both telaprevir-containing regimens, population-based and deep sequencing (454 GS-FLX) of the NS3 protease gene were performed before and at treatment failure (median coverage, 4,651 reads). Using deep sequencing, with a threshold of 1.0% for variant calling, no isolates were found harboring RAVs at the baseline time points. While population-based sequencing uncovered similar resistance patterns (V36M plus R155K for subtype 1a and V36A for subtype 1b) in all four patients after the first and second telaprevir treatments, deep sequencing analysis revealed a median of 7 (range, 4 to 23) nucleotide substitutions on the NS3 backbone of the resistant strains, together with large phylogenetic differences between viral quasispecies, making the survival of resistant isolates highly unlikely. In contrast, in a comparison of the two baseline time points, the median number of nucleotide exchanges in the wild-type isolates was only 3 (range, 2 to 8), reflecting the natural evolution of the NS3 gene. In patients with repeated direct antiviral treatment, a continuous evolution of HCV quasispecies was observed, with no clear evidence of persistence and reselection but strong signs of independent de novo generation of resistance. Antiviral therapy for chronic viral infections, like HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV), faces several challenges. These viruses have evolved survival strategies and proliferate by escaping the host's immune system. The development of direct-acting antiviral agents is an important achievement in fighting these infections. Viral variants conferring resistance to direct antiviral drugs lead to treatment failure. For HIV/HBV, it is well known that viral variants associated with treatment failure will be archived and reselected rapidly during retreatment with the same drug/class of drugs. We explored the mechanisms and rules of how resistant variants are selected and potentially reselected during repeated direct antiviral therapies in chronically HCV-infected patients. Interestingly, in contrast to HIV and HBV, we could not prove long-term persistence and reselection of resistant variants in HCV patients who failed protease inhibitor-based therapy. This may have important implications for the potential to reuse direct-acting antivirals in patients who failed the initial direct antiviral treatment. (The phase IIIb study described in this paper is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT01054573.). "

The T/T genotype of rs8099917 was not associated with the development of HCC (p = 0.623), although stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that liver cirrhosis, age greater than 68 years, and serum albumin <4.2 mg/dl were associated with HCC onset.

In this study we aimed to examine the regulation of NGAL in HIV infection. The regulation of NGAL in HIV infection was examined by different experimental approaches, including studies in peripheral blood and mononuclear cells (MNC) from bone marrow aspirates before and during highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). We found that: before initiating HAART, HIV-infected patients (n = 37) had significantly decreased serum NGAL levels compared with healthy controls (n = 26); (ii) during HAART, there was a gradual and significant increase in NGAL concentrations reaching levels comparable to those in healthy controls after 12 months; (iii) this increase was seen primarily in virological responders to HAART (HIV RNA level <200 copies/ml after 24 months); (iv) phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated NGAL release in MNC cells from bone marrow aspirates was decreased in untreated HIV-infected patients compared with healthy controls, but increased after 26 weeks on HAART; and (v) there was a significant positive correlation between neutrophil counts and NGAL levels at all time-points during HAART. We have shown decreased NGAL levels in HIV-infected patients, potentially reflecting decreased number and function of neutrophils as well as impaired bone marrow myelopoiesis. These abnormalities were reversed by successful HAART. Our findings underscore further the involvement of neutrophils and innate immunity in HIV-related immunodeficiency."

New direct-acting antiviral medications are available for HCV with high cure rates and few side effects. The life expectancy and economic benefits of new HCV treatments will not be realized unless we determine optimal models of care for the majority of HCV-infected patients.

Deaths from liver diseases have risen in the post-HAART era, yet some cross-sectional studies have suggested that HAART use is associated with improved fibrosis rates. In a retrospective cohort of 533 HIV mono-infected and 127 HIV/HCV co-infected patients, followed between January 1991 and July 2005 at a university-based HIV clinic, we investigated the relationship between cumulative HAART exposure and hepatic fibrosis, as measured by the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI). We used a novel methodological approach to estimate the dose-response relationship of the effect of HAART exposure on APRI. HAART was associated with increasing APRI over time in HIV/HCV co-infected patients suggesting that they may be experiencing cumulative hepatotoxicity from antiretrovirals. The estimated median change (95% confidence interval) in APRI per one year of HAART intake was of -0.46% (-1.61% to 0.71%) in HIV mono-infected compared to 2.54% (-1.77% to 7.03%) in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Similar results were found when the direct effect of HAART intake since the last visit was estimated on the change in APRI. HAART use associated is with increased APRI in patients with HIV/HCV co-infection. Therefore treatment for HCV infection may be required to slow the growing epidemic of end-stage liver disease in this population."

Cure rates of 75% were attained in HIV/HCV coinfected patients with the addition of the investigational HCV protease inhibitor (PI) simeprevir to peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Drug-drug interaction data to inform safe coadminstration of antiretroviral therapy with DAA-based HCV treatment were presented. There was continued emphasis on pathogenesis, management, and prevention of the long-term complications of HIV disease and its therapies, including cardiovascular disease, renal disease, alterations in bone metabolism, and vitamin D deficiency, along with a growing focus on biomarkers to predict development of end-organ disease.

HCV-RNA was assessed at baseline, weeks 4, 12 and 24. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated to determine the most sensitive cut-off values of viral decrease at week 4 predicting treatment failure. Baseline predictors of failure were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Despite similar baseline HCV-RNA (5.75 vs 5.72 log(10)IU/ml, P = 0.6), HCV monoinfection led to significantly lower HCV-RNA values at weeks 4 (3.7 vs 4.3 log(10)IU/ml, P = 0.01), 12 (2.3 vs 3.5 log(10)IU/ml, P = 0.01) and 24 (1.4 vs 3.3 log(10)IU/ml, P = 0.001) and a higher rates of viral clearance at weeks 24 (60%vs 36%, P = 0.02), 48 (46%vs 25%, P = 0.03) and 72 (37%vs 17%). The lack of achieving an HCV-RNA decrease of at least 1 log(10) at week 4 was highly predictive of treatment failure for HCV-monoinfected patients (Se 100%, Sp 50%, positive predictive value (PPV) 57%, negative predictive value (NPV) 100%, ROC curve area, 0.86 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-0.95], but not for HCV/HIV-coinfected patients (cut-off, 0 log(10), Se 100%, Sp 27%, PPV 21%, NPV 100%, ROC curve area, 0.71 (95% CI 0.49-0.93). HIV coinfection was independently associated with failure (odds ratio 2.95, 95% CI 1.08-8.04, P = 0.01). Thus the magnitude of HCV-RNA decreases at week 4 correlated with treatment response. Significant differences in viral kinetics and cut-off values predicting nonresponse suggest a slower HCV clearance rate in HIV coinfection, which was independently associated with treatment failure."

Barriers to, and experiences with, medical care have been found to vary by sex (2). Describing characteristics of Hispanics/Latinos in care by sex can help identify disparities and inform delivery of tailored services to this underserved population. Data from the 2013 and 2014 cycles of the Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) were analyzed to describe demographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics among Hispanics/Latinos by sex. MMP is an annual cross-sectional, nationally representative surveillance system that, during 2013-2014, collected information about behaviors, medical care, and clinical outcomes among adults receiving outpatient HIV care. Hispanic/Latina women were significantly more likely than were men to live in poverty (78% versus 54%), report not speaking English well (38% versus 21%), and receive interpreter (27% versus 16%), transportation (35% versus 21%), and meal (44% versus 26%) services. There were no significant differences between Hispanic/Latino women and men in prescription of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (95% versus 96%) or sustained viral suppression (68% versus 73%). Although women faced greater socioeconomic and language-related challenges, the clinical outcomes among Hispanic/Latina women were similar to those among men, perhaps reflecting their higher use of ancillary services. Levels of viral suppression for Hispanics/Latinos are lower than those found among non-Hispanic whites (3) and lower than the national prevention goal of at least 80% of persons with diagnosed HIV infection. Providers should be cognizant of the challenges faced by Hispanics/Latinos with HIV infection in care and provide referrals to needed ancillary services."

Serum BAFF levels in HBV patients were significantly elevated compared with healthy controls (P<0.001). HCC patients had significantly higher levels of serum BAFF than ASC, CH, and LC (all P<0.001). Serum levels of BAFF in LC were significantly higher than in ASC (P<0.001) and CH (P=0.002). Serum level of BAFF was an independent variable associated with the presence of HCC in comparison with other disease groups in multivariate analysis. The area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of BAFF levels was 0.914 for HCC versus ASC, 0.825 for HCC versus CH, and 0.607 for HCC versus LC, respectively. The AUC value of BAFF levels was 0.854 for LC versus ASC and 0.748 for LC versus CH, respectively. The AUC value of BAFF (0.888) for HCC was higher than that of alpha-fetoprotein (0.776). We first demonstrate that serum BAFF levels in chronic HBV infection are elevated, correlated with clinical diseases, and could be used as a biomarker for indicating disease mechanisms, activity, and diagnosis.

Several groups have shown that viruses within the central nervous system (CNS) of infected patients constitute an independently evolving subset of HIV strains. A potential explanation for the replication and sequestration of viruses within the CNS is the preferential use of certain chemokine receptors present in microglia. To determine the role of specific chemokine coreceptors in infection of adult microglial cells, we obtained a small panel of HIV type 1 brain isolates, as well as other HIV strains that replicate well in cultured microglial cells. These viruses and molecular clones of their envelopes were used in infections, in cell-to-cell fusion assays, and in the construction of pseudotypes. The results demonstrate the predominant use of CCR5, at least among the major coreceptors, with minor use of CCR3 and CXCR4 by some of the isolates or their envelope clones."

However, the fairly high prevalence of this infection among HIV-1-positive individuals indicates the importance of better understanding the potential interference of HTLV-2 infection on HIV-1 infection and AIDS. We previously demonstrated that one signature of PBMC freshly derived from HIV-1-infected individuals is the constitutive activation of a C-terminal truncated STAT5 (STAT5Delta). Therefore, we analyzed the potential activation of STATs in HTLV-2 monoinfected and HTLV-2/HIV-1 dually infected individuals. We observed that PBMC of HTLV-2-infected individuals do not show STAT activation unless they are cultivated ex vivo, in the absence of any mitogenic stimuli, for at least 8 h. The emergence of STAT activation, namely of STAT1, in culture was mostly related to the secretion of IFN-gamma. Of note, this phenomenon is not only a characteristic feature of HTLV-2-infected individuals but also occurred with PBMC of HIV-1(+) individuals. Surprisingly, HTLV-2/HIV-1 coinfection resulted in low/absent STAT activation in vivo that paralleled a diminished secretion of IFN-gamma after ex vivo cultivation. Our findings indicate that both HTLV-2 and HIV-1 infection prime T lymphocytes for STAT1 activation, but they also highlight an interference exerted by HTLV-2 on HIV-1-induced STAT1 activation. Although the nature of such a phenomenon is unclear at the present, these findings support the hypothesis that HTLV-2 may interfere with HIV-1 infection at multiple levels."
8402,0.005,1.0000,"The objectives of this study is to clarify whether there are phases critical for the infection of the central nervous system (CNS) as defined by active viral replication in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. One hundred and nine HIV-1-positive homo- and bisexual patients in early and late disease stages with or without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were included in the cross-sectional, diagnostic (phase I) multicenter study. No patients had any overt neurological deficits; all underwent venous and lumbar puncture as well as neuropsychological testing. In untreated early-stage patients, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral load correlated with inflammatory parameters, but not significantly with neuropsychological abnormalities. CSF viral load and inflammatory reactions were suppressed in HAART-treated early-stage patients. In HAART-treated late-stage patients, there was a weak correlation between CSF viral load and CSF cell count as well as a moderate correlation with immune activation markers and with distinct cerebral deficits independent of CSF viral load. Seventeen of the 109 patients had higher CSF than plasma viral loads and marked inflammatory reactions and immune activation. In patients with greater plasma than CSF viral loads, the factors contributing to cerebral deficits still need to be identified. The results suggest not only that there is an early ""set point"" for CSF/central nervous system (CNS) infection, but also that there is a subgroup of patients in whom intrathecal viral replication correlates with cerebral deficits. Lumbar puncture should be performed in all positive patients to identify members of this subgroup and to ascertain what characteristic factors they have in common in order to improve therapy."
18801,0.005,1.0000,"Prevalence and risk factors for hepatic steatosis (HS) in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive population of western countries are controversially discussed and potentially confounded by coinfection with viral hepatitis. Significant HS (more than 10% of hepatocytes) can be accurately assessed using controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) determination. Aim of this study was to assess prevalence and factors associated with significant HS in HIV monoinfected patients.A total of 364 HIV-infected patients (289 monoinfected) were included in this prospective, cross-sectional study. All patients underwent CAP determination. Steatosis was classified as S1 (significant steatosis) with CAP > 238 dB/m, S2 with CAP > 260 dB/m, and S3 with CAP > 292 dB/m. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the factors associated with HS in this cohort.Significant HS was detected in 118 monoinfected patients (149 in the total cohort). In the total cohort as well as in the monoinfected patients alone, HS grade distribution showed a similar pattern (S1:29%, S2:34%, and S3:37%). Interestingly, patients with HS had a longer history of HIV infection and combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Interalia, age, gender, ethnicity, and metabolic factors were strongly associated with HS, while body mass index (BMI), triglyceride, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were independently associated with significant HS.HS is highly prevalent among HIV monoinfected patients. Although metabolic risk factors, such as obesity and poorly controlled diabetes, are independently associated with HS in HIV monoinfected patients, cART and control of HIV seem to play an indirect role in the development of HS, probably through the return-to-health effect."
9224,0.005,1.0000,"To determine the onsets and specificities of neuropathological features observed after simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of macaques, brains of 19 clinically unaffected rhesus monkeys (group A) were examined after intervals ranging from 1 to 48 weeks post-infection and compared to 8 animals with AIDS (group B) as well as to 8 uninfected controls. Based on morphological and virological parameters, seven patterns specific for SIV infection of the central nervous system (CNS) were discerned. In both groups of infected but not control animals, we found mononuclear aggregates in meninges, perivascular space, and choroid plexus stroma (designated pattern 1), isolated infected cells within CNS parenchyma (pattern 2), axonal degeneration (pattern 3), spongy change (pattern 4), microglial proliferation (pattern 5), and small vessel proliferation (pattern 6). SIV encephalitis (pattern 7) was only evident in animals with clinically evident disease. Changes characteristic of patterns 3, 5 and 6 appeared to be chronic and non-progressive, whereas lesions of patterns 1, 2 and 4 appeared to have progressed in animals with AIDS. The main component of mononuclear aggregates in animals of group A were lymphocytes, in contrast to animals of group B, in which macrophages dominated the inflammatory infiltrates. Altogether, our results demonstrate that subtle leukoencephalopathy was a specific feature of clinically silent as well as clinically evident phases of SIV infection. This might explain the neurological impairment of HIV-positive non-AIDS individuals."
659,0.005,1.0000,"A nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone is a recommended component of standard highly active antiretroviral therapy (sHAART). However, long-term NRTI exposure can be limited by toxicities. NRTI class-sparing alternatives are warranted in select patient populations. This is a 48-week single-center, open-label pilot study in which 60 HIV-infected adults with plasma HIV-1 RNA (<50 copies/ml) on sHAART were randomized (2:1) to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) 400/100 mg BID+raltegravir (RAL) 400 mg BID switch (LPV-r/RAL arm) or to continue on sHAART. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HIV-RNA<50 copies/ml at week 48. Secondary efficacy and immunologic and safety endpoints were evaluated. Demographics and baseline lipid profile were similar across arms. Mean entry CD4 T cell count was 493 cells/mm(3). At week 48, 92% [95% confidence interval (CI): 83-100%] of the LPV-r/RAL arm and 88% (95% CI: 75-100%) of the sHAART arm had HIV-RNA<50 copies/ml (p=0.70). Lipid profile (mean ± SEM, mg/dl, LPV-r/RAL vs. sHAART) at week 24 was total-cholesterol 194 ± 5 vs. 176 ± 9 (p=0.07), triglycerides 234 ± 30 vs. 133 ± 27 (p=0.003), and LDL-cholesterol 121 ± 6 vs. 110 ± 8 (p=0.27). There were no serious adverse events (AEs) in either arm. Regimen change occurred in three LPV-r/RAL subjects (n=1, due to LPV-r/RAL-related AEs) vs. 0 in sHAART. There were no differences between arms in bone mineral density, total body fat composition, creatinine clearance, or CD4 T cell counts at week 48. In virologically suppressed patients on HAART, switching therapy to the NRTI-sparing LPV-r/RAL combination produced similar sustained virologic suppression and immunologic profile as sHAART. AEs were comparable between arms, but the LPV-r/RAL arm experienced higher triglyceridemia."
19609,0.005,1.0000,"Lipodystrophy is a common long-term complication of HIV infection that may lead to decreased quality of life and less adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). A complete understanding of the etiology of HIV-associated lipodystrophy has not yet been achieved, although factors related to the virus, per se, and use of ART appear to be related. Alcohol use is common among HIV-infected patients and has biological effects on fat distribution, yet alcohol's relationship to HIV-associated lipodystrophy has not been examined. The goal of this clinical study was to assess the effect of alcohol consumption on lipodystrophy in HIV-infected adults with alcohol problems. This was a prospective study (2001-2006) of 289 HIV-infected persons with alcohol problems. The primary outcome was self-reported lipodystrophy, which was assessed at one time point (median 29 months after enrollment). Alcohol use was assessed every 6 months and classified as: abstinent at all interviews; > or = 1 report of moderate drinking but no heavy drinking; 1 or 2 reports of heavy drinking; or > or = 3 reports of heavy drinking. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to the data. Fifty-two percent (150/289) of subjects reported lipodystrophy. Alcohol consumption was: 34% abstinent at all interviews; 12% > or = 1 report of moderate drinking, but no heavy drinking; 34% 1-2 reports of heavy drinking; and 20% > or = 3 reports of heavy drinking. Although not statistically significant, subjects with alcohol use had a higher odds of lipodystrophy (adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence interval: > or = 1 report of moderate drinking, 2.36 [0.89, 6.24]; 1-2 reports of heavy drinking, 1.34 [0.69, 2.60]; > or = 3 reports of heavy drinking, 2.07 [0.90, 4.73]). Alcohol use may increase the odds of developing HIV-associated lipodystrophy among subjects with alcohol problems. However, larger studies are needed to fully elucidate the role and impact of alcohol consumption on the development of this common long-term complication of HIV infection and its treatment."
5079,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B is a very common communicable disease in China but the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients with autoimmune diseases is unknown. We retrospectively investigated the prevalence of autoimmune diseases in patients with HBV infection. The medical records of 4060 patients with autoimmune or nonautoimmune diseases were reviewed. A positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was used to indicate the presence of HBV infection. Autoimmune diseases included autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and ulcerative colitis. Nonautoimmune conditions included inguinal hernia, appendicitis and pregnant or postpartum women. The proportion of autoimmune disease patients who were HBsAg positive (2.24%) was significantly lower than that of nonautoimmune disease patients who were HBsAg positive (4.58%; P = 0.0014). Regarding hepatic autoimmune diseases, the positivity rates for HBsAg in autoimmune hepatitis patients (0.83%) and primary biliary cirrhosis patients (1.02%) were both significantly lower than in nonautoimmune patients (4.58%; P = 0.006 and 0.004, respectively). Patients with hepatic autoimmune disease were significantly less likely to be HBsAg positive (0.93%) than patients with non-hepatic autoimmune disease (3.99%; P = 0.002). Patients with autoimmune diseases, especially those with hepatic autoimmune disease, may more efficiently clear HBV than patients with nonautoimmune diseases. "
16871,0.005,1.0000,"Retroviruses have distinct preferences in integration site selection in the host cell genome during in vitro infection, with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration strongly favoring transcriptional units. Additionally, studies with HIV-1 have shown that the genomic site of proviral integration may impact viral replication, with integration in heterochromatin associated with a block in viral transcription. HIV-2 is less pathogenic than HIV-1 and is believed to have a lower replication rate in vivo. Although differences in integration site selection between HIV-2 and HIV-1 could potentially explain the attenuated pathogenicity of HIV-2, no studies have characterized integration site selection by HIV-2. In this study, we mapped 202 HIV-2 integration sites during in vitro infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with a primary HIV-2 isolate. In addition, we assayed for in vivo proviral integration within heterochromatin in 21 HIV-1-infected subjects and 23 HIV-2-infected subjects, using an alphoid repeat PCR assay. During in vitro infection, HIV-2 displayed integration site preferences similar to those previously reported for HIV-1. Notably, 82% of HIV-2 integrations mapped to Refseq genes, and integration strongly favored regions of the genome with high gene density and high GC content. Though rare, the proportion of HIV-2 subjects with evidence of proviral integration within heterochromatin in vivo was higher than that of HIV-1-infected subjects. It is therefore possible that integration site selection may play a role in the differences in HIV-1 and HIV-2 in vivo pathogenesis."
17064,0.005,1.0000,"Lopinavir is a novel protease inhibitor (PI) developed from ritonavir. Coadministration with low-dose ritonavir significantly improves the pharmacokinetic properties and hence the activity of lopinavir against HIV-1 protease. Coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir was developed for ease of administration and to ensure both drugs are taken together, as part of combination therapy with other antiretroviral agents. Coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimens provide adequate and durable suppression of viral load and sustained improvements in CD4+ cell counts, as demonstrated in randomised trials in antiretroviral therapy-naive and -experienced adults and children. To date, development of primary resistance to lopinavir/ritonavir has not been observed in 470 antiretroviral therapy-naive patients treated for >48 weeks. The lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimen was more effective than nelfinavir in antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV-1-infected patients in a phase III trial. The coformulation is also effective as 'salvage' therapy, as shown by low cross-resistance rates in patients who failed to respond to treatment with other PIs in phase II trials. Coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir was well tolerated in both antiretroviral therapy-naive and -experienced HIV-1-infected adults and children with low rates of study drug-related treatment discontinuations. The most common adverse event in adults associated with lopinavir/ritonavir was diarrhoea, followed by other gastrointestinal disturbances, asthenia, headache and skin rash. The incidence of moderate-to-severe adverse events in children was low, skin rash being the most common. Changes in body fat composition occurred with equal frequency in lopinavir/ritonavir- and nelfinavir-treated naive patients, through week 60 in a phase III study. Although laboratory abnormalities occurred with similar frequency in both treatment groups, triglycerides grade 3/4 elevations were significantly more frequent with lopinavir/ritonavir. Total cholesterol and triglycerides grade 3/4 elevations appear to occur more frequently in PI-experienced than in PI-naive lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients. A number of clinically important drug interactions have been reported with lopinavir/ritonavir necessitating dosage adjustments of lopinavir/ritonavir and/or the interacting drugs, and several other drugs are contraindicated in patients receiving the coformulation."
2950,0.005,1.0000,"Boceprevir (Victrelis®) is an inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural protein NS3-4A serine protease and is used in combination with pegylated interferon (peginterferon)-alpha and ribavirin in the treatment of adults with chronic HCV (chronic hepatitis C) genotype 1 infection. Of the various genotypes of HCV, genotype 1 is one of the least responsive to interferon and ribavirin-based therapy, and thus most in need of novel treatments. This article reviews the available pharmacological properties of boceprevir and its clinical efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection in adult patients who are either treatment-naive or have failed previous standard therapy. Boceprevir, when co-administered with peginterferon-alpha and ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection who were treatment-naive or had previously not fully responded to or had relapsed following treatment, was associated with a significantly higher sustained virological response rate (defined as the proportion of patients with an undetectable plasma HCV RNA level at week 24 of the follow-up period [week 72 overall]) [primary endpoint] than peginterferon-alpha-2b and ribavirin alone, regardless of the boceprevir administration regimen, in the phase III SPRINT-2 (treatment-naive patients) and RESPOND-2 (previously treated patients) trials. There was no significant difference between full-duration (44 weeks) and response-guided (24 or 32 weeks followed by follow-up or peginterferon-alpha-2b plus ribavirin alone) boceprevir regimen recipients with regard to sustained virological response rate. All patients received an initial 4-week lead-in treatment period before the comparative treatment period began. Overall, boceprevir is generally well tolerated when administered concomitantly with peginterferon-alpha plus ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection. The most common adverse events in any treatment group were flu-like symptoms, which are typically reported in patients receiving peginterferon-ribavirin therapy. The addition of boceprevir to peginterferon-alpha and ribavirin is associated with an increased risk of anaemia and neutropenia. In conclusion, boceprevir in combination with peginterferon-alpha and ribavirin is an effective and generally well tolerated treatment for treatment-naive or previously treated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection. The drug is associated with higher sustained virological response rates in these patients, in whom treatment with interferon and ribavirin alone may not be successful. Thus, boceprevir in combination with peginterferon-alpha and ribavirin is a valuable new treatment option for use in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection."
5519,0.005,1.0000,"Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier is commonly seen in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia, despite the lack of productive HIV-infection of the brain endothelium. Through this damaged blood-brain barrier, HIV and HIV-infected monocytes/macrophages infiltrate the brain and further infect microglia and brain macrophages. Neuronal cell death and dysfunction are the underlying cause of HIV-associated dementia, but no productive HIV-infection of neurons has been documented. It is likely that secreted viral products play a major role in blood-brain barrier damage and neuronal cell death. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of HIV-1 gp160 peptides and gp120 proteins on brain microvascular endothelial cells and neurons from both human and rats. Four of the 7 gp160 peptides tested evoked significant neurotoxicity. Two different full-length recombinant HIV gp120 proteins (HIV-1CM235 gp120 and HIV-1MN gp120) also induced neuronal and brain endothelial cell death, and concentrations as little as 1 ng/ml evoked pronounced morphological changes in these cells and marked cytotoxicity. This study suggests that HIV proteins and peptides that are shed in vivo may be directly involved in blood-brain barrier damage and neuronal cell death in HIV-associated dementia."

The main barrier to adherence as identified by participants in the study was the stigma associated with living with HIV, and thus with receiving AIDS treatment. A second barrier was the fact that some patients willfully decide to forgo treatment so that they could retain state disability benefits associated with a low CD4 count. Other barriers included the lack of finances for transport to clinics and food insecurity, especially when medication needed to be taken with food. These barriers to ART adherence are conceptualized in terms of Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory."

We describe herein a complex case seen at The Johns Hopkins Hospital with several psychiatric conditions that are common in our HIV clinic population. We describe the collaborative treatment of the patient by a multidisciplinary team including both medical and mental health practitioners.

17702,0.005,1.0000,"Diarrhea remains a common problem for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection despite highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) and can negatively affect patient quality of life and lead to discontinuation or switching of HAART regimens. In the era of HAART, diarrhea from opportunistic infections is uncommon, and HIV-associated diarrhea often has noninfectious causes, including HAART-related adverse events and HIV enteropathy. Diarrhea associated with HAART is typically caused by protease inhibitors (eg, ritonavir), which may damage the intestinal epithelial barrier (leaky-flux diarrhea) and/or alter chloride ion secretion (secretory diarrhea). HIV enteropathy may result from direct effects of HIV on gastrointestinal tract cells and on the gastrointestinal immune system and gut-associated lymphoid tissue, which may be active sites of HIV infection and ongoing inflammation and mucosal damage. New therapies targeting the pathogenic mechanisms of noninfectious diarrheas are needed."
16407,0.005,1.0000,"It is well known that several dermatoses, such as psoriasis vulgaris and seborrheic dermatitis, present with more extensive and severe disease in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Except for one report, however, lichen planus (LP) has not been described in patients with HIV infection. In this report we describe the clinical and morphological features of 3 HIV-positive patients who presented with extensive hypertrophic LP. To determine if alteration in the immune status in HIV-positive hosts is reflected in the nature of the infiltrate in LP, we determined the proportion of T-helper and T-suppressor cells in the infiltrate in 1 case. The majority of the infiltrating lymphocytes in the dermis were of the T-helper phenotype. Epidermal lymphocytes, however, were predominantly of the T-suppressor phenotype. We conclude that LP in HIV-positive hosts may present with more extensive disease than in immunocompetent hosts. Based on our immunohistochemical studies, we conclude that, similar to immunocompetent hosts, T-helper cells are the predominant cells in the dermal infiltrate of LP in HIV-positive patients. However, in contrast with reports in the literature on LP in immunocompetent hosts, we found that, in the case studied, the epidermal lymphocytes were predominantly of the T-suppressor phenotype."
6564,0.005,1.0000,"Severe chronic active hepatitis, defined as the presence of a fivefold increase in serum aminotransferases and a twofold rise in gamma globulin for at least 10 weeks, is considered a progressive immunological liver disease requiring corticosteroid treatment, particularly when serum autoantibodies and a severe lymphoplasmacellular periportal infiltrate are found in the liver biopsy specimen. A 38 year old man who fulfilled the criteria for severe chronic active hepatitis is described. His sex, his homosexuality, and the presence of antibodies against HIV, however, led to the suspicion of a coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) rather than autoimmune disease. The rapid and complete response to alpha interferon treatment and a recently available positive antibody test for HCV supported this view. These findings indicate that a HCV related chronic active hepatitis can present as the severe autoimmune type of chronic active hepatitis. Moreover, as in HBV infection, the response to treatment differs from that of autoimmune severe chronic active hepatitis."
12743,0.005,1.0000,"Primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a rarely diagnosed disease. The intestinal lymphocyte population represents a primary target of infection, virus replication, as well as cell infiltration and activation. The purpose of this study was to describe a patient suffering from esophageal giant ulcer as a clinical manifestation of primary HIV. In the present case of primary HIV infection a giant ulcer of the esophagus was diagnosed as the clinical manifestation. An upper endoscopy was performed and the biopsy specimens were further processed for immunohistochemical stainings characterizing the cellular infiltrate as well as cytokine production. In addition, seroconversion was documented and total viral load was determined. The esophageal ulceration presented the clinical manifestation of primary HIV infection since other causes of esophageal ulcerations could be excluded. The ulceration revealed an inflammatory infiltrate consisting of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. The vast majority of these cells expressed the activation marker CD38 and several cells showed interferon-gamma and interleukin-2 production. Furthermore, a substantial number of tissue infiltrating CD8(+) T cells expressed the cytotoxic molecule perforin. In addition, the HIV antigen p24 could be detected in the inflammatory infiltrate. Subsequent steroid treatment resulted in a relief of symptoms and healing of the ulcerations. These observations strongly suggest that infiltration of activated T cells plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of giant ulcers during primary HIV infection."

HBV surface antibodies (Anti-HBs) were present in 6/85 (7.1%) paramedics of whom one (1.2%) had reactive HBV core antibodies (Anti-HBc). No paramedic had HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). Seropositivity was not associated with duration of employment, or exposure to a patient with either jaundice (28.2%) or confirmed hepatitis B (20.0%) within the six months prior to testing. The 7.1% prevalence of HBV markers found in this group of suburban paramedics is intermediate between previously reported rates for urban paramedics.

However, little is known about the role of miRNA-323b in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-host interaction. We explored whether single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of miRNA-323b affects HBV replication in a Korean HBV cohort. Genotyping was performed in a total of 1439 subjects composed of 404 spontaneously recovered (SR) subjects as normal controls and 1035 chronic carriers (CC) of HBV who were further classified into 313 patients with chronic hepatitis, 305 patients with liver cirrhosis and 417 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. To confirm the effect of SNP of miRNA-323b on HBV replication in vitro, HepAD38 cells were transfected with miRNA-323b wild type or miRNA-323b SNP plasmid vectors, and HBV replication was induced for 5 days. HBV DNA was isolated and quantified using real-time PCR. The polymorphism rs56103835C>T in the pre-miRNA region of miRNA-323b revealed significant minor allele frequency (0.273). rs56103835C>T SNP showed significantly affect persistence of HBV in CC group compared with SR group (OR = 1.29, P = 0.009 in a codominant model; OR = 1.29, P = 0.03 in a dominant model; and OR = 1.78, P = 0.03 in a recessive model). In vitro, the total intracellular HBV DNA content was significantly reduced by miRNA-323b wild-type plasmid vector transfection (P = 0.014). The polymorphism of miRNA-323b was significantly associated with persistence of HBV by the enhancement of HBV replication (P = 0.021). Our findings provide a novel perspective on the role SNP of miRNAs in host-virus interactions in HBV infection. "

The importance of these SNPs for HCV genotype 3 (HCV-3), and particularly HCV genotype 6 (HCV-6), remains to be elucidated. We analyzed a cohort of 225 Thai individuals with chronic HCV infection treated with pegylated-interferon and ribavirin, of whom 69 (30.7%), 114 (50.7%) and 42 (18.6%) patients were infected with HCV-1, HCV-3, and HCV-6, respectively. DNA extracted from blood samples was analyzed for the SNPs rs12979860 and ss469415590. The distribution of CC, CT, and TT genotypes of rs12979860 was 189 (84%), 28 (12.4%) and 8 (3.6%), respectively, while the distribution of TT/TT, ΔG/TT, and ΔG/ΔG genotypes of ss469415590 was 192(85.3%), 28(12.5%), and 5(2.2%), respectively. Significantly lower frequencies of the favorable genotypes CC (for rs12979860) and TT/TT (for ss469415590) were found in the HCV-1 group in comparison with the other groups. The favorable genotypes were associated significantly with rapid and sustained virological response in the HCV-1 group. However, they were only associated with rapid virological response in the HCV-3 and HCV-6 groups. Furthermore, both SNPs were associated equally with the treatment outcome in the HCV-1 group. In contrast, the role of these SNPs in predicting treatment response was attenuated in the HCV-3 and HCV-6 groups. Thus, identification of these SNPs may be useful only in patients with refractory HCV-1 infection."

Patients who are positive for hepatitis B early antigen (HBeAg) have active liver disease. The present study aimed to evaluate the possible role of HBeAg in patients with resectable HCC. A series of 249 HCC patients with complete preoperative hepatitis marker who had undergone potentially curative resection were enrolled. Patients with hepatitis C virus infection were excluded. Of these patients, 27 were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBeAg (group I), 171 were positive for HBsAg and negative for HBeAg (group II), and 51 were negative for hepatitis B markers (group III). The clinicopathologic features and postoperative survivals were compared among the three groups. The prevalence of HBeAg was 10.8%. Group I patients were significantly younger and had worse liver function, smaller tumors, and a higher incidence of liver cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis than those in groups II and III. No increase in tumor invasiveness was noted in group I patients. The operative morbidity, mortality, and postresection survival were comparable among the three groups. Our findings indicated that HBeAg positivity is not a negative factor for resection in HCC patients and has no significant influence on postresection survival."
19321,0.005,1.0000,"Based on the involvement of nuclear factor-κB inhibitor alpha (NFKIBA) in the NF-κ B pathway, which is closely related to host immunity, we evaluated whether NFKIBA polymorphisms are associated with the disease progression of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We collected blood samples from a total of 212 treatment-naïve patients with chronic HBV infection. NFKBIA polymorphisms were determined by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were employed to quantify the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6(IL-6). Unconditional logistic regression revealed that carriers of the TT genotype at rs2233406 had a greater risk (OR = 5.57, 95% CI = 2.14-14.52) of chronic HBV infection progression. A similar association was observed for the rs2233409 polymorphism, in which the OR for the TT genotype was 4.06 (95% CI = 1.70-9.71) compared to that for the wildtype CC genotype. Mutations at rs2233406 and rs2233409 also impact liver function parameters and cytokine levels. However, null associations were observed between these parameters and rs696 polymorphism. These findings suggest that reduced NFKBIA function leads to activation of the NF-κB pathway, and consequently causes inflammation and liver damage among patients with chronic HBV infection."
18480,0.005,1.0000,"A retrospective survey to estimate the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) infections was conducted on the samples of 247 African HIV-1 positive pregnant women who had participated to a mother-to-child prevention trial carried out in urban settings in Kampala, Uganda and Kigali, Rwanda. Hepatitis B markers studied were HBs antigen (HBsAg) and, if positive after confirmatory testing, HBe antigen/anti-HBe antibodies and HBV DNA. A fourth generation HCV enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was used for primary HCV screening. Positive samples were analyzed further with a second different EIA. Both for HBV and for HCV the use of confirmatory tests allowed the removal of frequent false-positive screening results. HBsAg was found in 10/246 women (seroprevalence 4.1%, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.7-6.8): 8/164 (4.9%) in Uganda and 2/82 (2.4%) in Rwanda. HBe Ag was found in 33% of HBsAg-positive patients and HBV DNA was quantifiable in 71%. Anti-HCV antibodies were found in 5/247 women (seroprevalence 2.0% 95%CI 0.3-3.9): 1/165 (0.6%) in Uganda and 4/82 (4.9%) in Rwanda. There was no interrelation between HCV and HBV markers. There was no difference between patients with and without co-infection with HBV or HCV with regards to CD4+ cell count. Overall, hepatitis B and C co-infection was relatively infrequent in this group of pregnant women. However, since approximately 6% of HIV-positive women in these countries had a co-infection with one hepatitis virus, caution should be used in the monitoring of possible hepatotoxicity related to antiretroviral drugs in these populations."
18083,0.005,1.0000,"Treponema pallidum, its membrane lipoproteins, and synthetic lipoprotein analogues (lipopeptides) were each examined to determine whether they induced CCR5 expression on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for CCR5 gene transcripts, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1beta binding assays, and flow cytometry revealed that either T. pallidum, a representative treponemal lipoprotein, or a corresponding synthetic lipopeptide induced CCR5 on CD14 monocytes but not on CD3 lymphocytes. CXCR4, the coreceptor for T cell-tropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), was not induced on PBMC by treponemes or by lipoproteins or lipopeptides. Consistent with these findings, T. pallidum, lipoprotein, and synthetic lipopeptide all promoted the entry of a macrophage-tropic, but not a T cell-tropic, strain of HIV-1 into monocytes. These combined results imply that T. pallidum and its constituent lipoproteins likely induce the expression of CCR5 on macrophages in syphilitic lesions, thereby enhancing transmission of macrophage-tropic HIV-1."
2610,0.005,1.0000,"We have studied, at a molecular level, two small non-cleaved cell malignant lymphomas (Burkitt's type) that were separated by a disease-free interval of 3 years in a patient infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The late occurrence of the apparent relapse suggested that the second lymphoma might be caused by a separate malignant transformation in a discrete clone of B cells. Although both tumors expressed the same immunologic surface markers (mu k) and carried the same t(8;14) translocation, Southern blot analysis of DNA from each tumor, using specific restriction endonucleases and probes to the c-myc and the immunoglobulin heavy chain loci, demonstrated that the chromosomal breakpoints relevant to the translocations differed between the tumors. This was corroborated by analysis of the immunoglobulin light-chain rearrangements in the two tumors. These observations indicate that the second tumor was not a recurrence of the first but represented the malignant transformation of a different clone of B cells. Thus late relapses of certain malignancies in individuals at high risk may be caused by the malignant transformation of discrete cell clones (i.e., induction of a new tumor)."
17664,0.005,1.0000,"The associations among timing of maternal-fetal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, infant age at first positive HIV culture, and CD8+ lymphocyte activation were examined for 74 perinatally infected infants. Nineteen of the infected infants had positive HIV cultures at < or =7 days of life, and 55 had negative HIV cultures at < or =7 days but were positive later. Of the infants with early positive HIV-1 cultures, 15 of the 17 tested with DNA polymerase chain reaction methods had concordant results. The percentage of CD8+ and HLA-DR+ lymphocytes (CD8+DR+%) during the first week of life was significantly higher in infants with early compared with late positive cultures (median CD8+DR+% of 5.0% versus 2.0%, p = 0.0006). The CD8+DR+% was similar between uninfected infants and infants with late positive cultures during the first week of life (median 2%) but increased in infants with late positive cultures to 6% by 1 month. The CD4+% during the first 6 months of life was not different between infants with early or with late positive cultures, but infants with the highest CD8+DR+% at < or =7 days of life had significantly lower CD4+% at < or =7 days and at 1, 2, and 4 months of age. These data show that early CD8+ lymphocyte activation is associated with early positive HIV cultures and lower CD4+ percentages during early infancy and are consistent with the hypothesis that early positive cultures positivity may indicate in utero HIV infection."
492,0.005,1.0000,"We assessed the survival of 1,044 HIV-infected persons enrolled in three periods: period 1, 1994 to 1997 (before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]); period 2, 1997 to 2000 (early-HAART); and period 3, 2000 to 2004 (late-HAART). As of 30 June 2005, 259 (24.8%) persons had died after a median observation duration of 985 days (range, 2 - 4,025 days). The mortality rate declined from 33.75 per 100 person-years in the pre-HAART era to 6.51 per 100 person-years in the late-HAART era (P < 0.0001). The adjusted hazard ratios for death in persons with a baseline CD4 count of <200 cells/mul in periods 2 and 3 were 0.605 (P = 0.007) and 0.371 (P < 0.0001), respectively, when compared with persons enrolled in period 1; the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 0.611 for persons enrolled in period 3 when compared to period 2 (P = 0.01). Our study suggested that the survival of persons in the late stage of HIV infection in Taiwan continued to improve in the late HAART era."
16070,0.005,1.0000,"Although available antiretroviral therapy (ART) has changed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection to a non-fatal chronic disease, the economic burden of lifelong therapy, severe adverse ART effects, daily ART adherence, and emergence of ART-resistant HIV-1 mutants require prospecting for alternative therapeutic modalities. Indeed, a growing body of evidence suggests that broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies (BNAbs) may offer one such feasible alternative. To evaluate their therapeutic potential in established HIV-1 infection, we sought to address recent advances in pre-clinical and clinical investigations in this area of HIV-1 research. In addition, we addressed the obstacles that may impede the success of such immunotherapeutic approach, suggested strategic solutions, and briefly compared this approach with the currently used ART to open new insights for potential future passive immunotherapy for HIV-1 infection."
16144,0.005,1.0000,"Recent policies, guidelines, and laws reflect promising preliminary outcomes among transplant recipients with HIV infection, and ethical analyses suggest that it is not justifiable to deny solid organ transplantation based solely on HIV-infection status. These studies consistently describe stable HIV disease following liver and kidney transplantation. Despite good graft survival, kidney allograft rejection occurs frequently, and serious non-AIDS-defining infections requiring hospitalization are common following antirejection therapy. Profound interactions between immunosuppressants and antiretroviral drugs require careful monitoring, dose adjustment, and highly effective communication between the patient and a multidisciplinary group of health care providers. Despite these scientific and policy advances, many health care providers and patients remain unaware of ongoing progress in this field. The implications are critical, as late referral for liver transplant evaluation increases the pretransplant mortality risk. Because important patient selection and clinical management questions remain, it is critical that ongoing studies are completed quickly."
6491,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the genetic pattern (GP) defined by the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs14158 of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and rs12979860 of interleukin-28B (IL28B) genes on the outcome and features of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. 314 HIV/HCV-coinfected and 109 HCV-monoinfected patients treated with pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV), as well as 51 patients with HCV spontaneous clearance (SC), were included. Variations in both SNPs were determined by the TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. In the 286 patients chronically infected by HCV genotypes 1 or 4, both rs14158 CC and rs12979860 CC were associated with a higher rate of sustained virological response (SVR), and these effects were complementary in both HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Thus, 24 % of patients with rs14158/rs12979860 TT-TC/TT-TC, 33 % with TT-TC/CC, 44.2 % with CC/TT-TC, and 75.8 % harboring CC/CC attained SVR (p < 0.001). SC was associated with the IL28B genotype (66.7 % CC in SC vs. 42.6 % among those with chronic infection, p < 0.001) but not with the LDLR genotype. There was no association between GP and the plasma level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or the presence of advanced fibrosis. There is a complementary effect between the IL28B and LDLR genotypes on the probability of achieving SVR after Peg-IFN/RBV therapy in patients with HCV 1 or 4. Thus, the predictive value of IL28B genotype is modulated by the LDLR genotype in both HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. This complementary effect of both genotypes is also observed on the plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)."
12754,0.005,1.0000,"There is overwhelming evidence that invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) by HIV-1 takes place at an early stage of the infection. It has been demonstrated that HIV-1 DNA is present in brains of asymptomatic individuals. Evidence of immune activation and increased expression of cytokines suggested that neuropathological changes and neuronal and axonal damage could be the effect of the presence of the virus. The purpose of the study is to ascertain whether target cells for HIV-1 in brain of patients at early stage of the infection are the same as those found in AIDS sufferers or if the distribution seen in AIDS patients results from the late spreading of the infection from cells considered traditionally the reservoir of the virus, i.e. microglial cells. Eighteen brains, all HIV-1 DNA positive, as shown by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were selected among the group of HIV-1 positive asymptomatic cases. In 6 of them, HIV-1 DNA was detected by PCR in situ. Positive cells included astrocytes and endothelial cells, in addition to microglial cells. We conclude that astrocytes and endothelial cells are already infected at an early (asymptomatic) stage of the infection and suggest that they might contribute to the damage of the CNS."
3636,0.005,1.0000,"Current therapies available for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B are limited in their ability to result in a cure. Clevudine is a new pyrimidine analog with potent anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) activity in vitro. A multicenter dose-escalation study evaluated clevudine at 10, 50, 100, and 200 mg once daily for 28 days. Eligible patients had HBV DNA levels of 3 x 10(6) copies/mL or more, had not undergone nucleoside treatment, and were without human immunodeficiency or hepatitis C virus coinfection. Thirty-two patients were enrolled (5, 10, 10, and 7 patients in the 10-, 50-, 100-, and 200-mg dose groups, respectively), 81% were male, 81% Asian, and 88% were hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) positive at baseline. Median pretreatment serum HBV DNA levels ranged from 7.3 to 8.8 log(10) copies/mL. After 28 days, the median HBV DNA log(10) change from baseline was -2.5, -2.7, -3.0, and -2.6 log(10). Six months after dosing, median changes from baseline were -1.2, -1.4, -2.7 and -1.7 log(10) in the 10-, 50-, 100-, and 200-mg cohorts, respectively. Six of 27 patients lost HBeAg, and 3 of 27 patients seroconverted to HBe antibody. Clevudine was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities. A transient increase in alanine aminotransferase of up to 7.8 times the upper limit of normal (increase ranged from 20 to 186 IU/L) was observed in six patients in the 100-mg cohort, without signs of liver failure. These increases were associated with improved viral suppression. The pharmacokinetic profile of clevudine was proportional to the dose. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the tolerability and potent activity of clevudine in HBV-infected patients and support further clinical study."

16795,0.005,1.0000,"Several linear fatty acid dopamides (N-acyldopamines) have been identified recently in the brain. Among them, N-arachidonoyldopamine (NADA) is an endogenous lipid mediator sharing endocannabinoid and endovanilloid biological activities. We have reported previously that NADA exerts some of its biological activities through inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway and, because this transcription factor plays a key role in HIV-1-long terminal repeat (LTR) trans activation, we have evaluated the anti-HIV-1 activity of NADA. In this study, we show that NADA inhibits vesicular stomatitis virus-pseudotyped HIV-1 infection in the human leukemia T cell line Jurkat, in primary T cells, and in the human astrocytic cell line U373-MG. Other endocannabinoids such as anandamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, and noladin ether did not show inhibitory activity in the HIV-1 replication assays. The anti-HIV-1 activity of NADA was independent of known cannabinoid and vanilloid receptor activation. In addition, NADA did not affect reverse transcription and integration steps of the viral cycle, and its inhibitory effect was additive with that of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothymidine. NADA inhibited both TNF-alpha and HIV-1 trans activator protein-induced HIV-1-LTR activation. We also show that NADA counteracts the TNF-alpha-mediated trans activation capacity of the p65 NF-kappaB subunit without affecting its physical association to the HIV-1-LTR promoter. Moreover, NADA inhibited the p65 transcriptional activity by specifically targeting the phosphorylation of this NF-kappaB subunit at Ser(536). These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the biological activities of NADA, and highlight the potential of lipid mediators for the management of AIDS."
4580,0.005,1.0000,"The incidence of lymphomas in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus has increased progressively since the beginning of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. The present series includes 111 patients, all diagnosed and studied at one hospital in New York City. There were 108 men and three women; the average age was 39 years and male homosexuality was the predominant risk factor. The materials examined originated from 138 surgical specimens and 24 autopsies. There were 11 cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma and 100 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), a proportion strongly skewed in favor of the latter. Hodgkin's lymphoma in AIDS patients was characterized by advanced clinical stage, high histologic grade, and frequent bone marrow involvement. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in AIDS patients, in contrast to the general population, originated predominantly in extranodal locations (61 cases) versus locations in which the lymph nodes were the site of the primary tumors (39 cases). In the digestive tract, the unusual oral and anal primary locations were often noted and were possibly related to specific risk factors. There were 15 cases of NHL of the central nervous system, an incidence 14 times greater than that recorded in the general population. The majority of NHLs were of high histologic grade, Burkitt's and large cell immunoblastic, representing most of the cerebral and gastrointestinal tumors. All NHLs were of B-cell immunophenotype. Lymphadenopathies with the histologic features of human immunodeficiency virus infection, particularly of the late stage (type C), often preceded NHL. Probing for Epstein-Barr virus genome was more frequently positive in Hodgkin's lymphoma than in NHL. Immunologic evaluations showed severely depressed T cell counts and CD4 to CD8 cell ratios as well as markedly increased levels of antilymphocyte antibodies. Reflecting the background of profound immune deficiency, the AIDS-associated lymphomas were characterized by high aggressiveness, early tendency to generalization, frequent post-treatment relapse, and short periods of survival."
9140,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has a complicated course. Three phases are identified: an immune tolerant phase with high HBV DNA and normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels associated with minimal liver disease; an immune active phase with high HBV DNA and elevated ALT levels with active liver inflammation; and an inactive phase with HBV DNA levels < 2000 IU/mL and normal ALT levels with minimal inflammation and fibrosis on liver biopsy. Affected persons can move progressively from one phase to the next and may revert backward. The primary adverse outcomes of chronic HBV infection are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis. Published natural history studies were reviewed and ranked by the strength of evidence regarding the study design. Factors with the highest evidence of risk for development of HCC or cirrhosis from population-based prospective cohort studies include male sex, family history of HCC, HBV DNA level above 2000 IU/mL in persons above age 40, HBV genotypes C and F, and basal core promoter mutation. Those with the next highest level of evidence include aflatoxin exposure, and heavy alcohol and tobacco use. Improved methods to identify persons at highest risk of developing HCC or cirrhosis are needed to allow intervention earlier with antiviral therapy in appropriate patients. Future studies should include prospective follow-up of established population-based cohorts as well as new cohorts recruited from multiple centers stratified by HBV genotypes/subgenotypes and clinical phase to determine the incidence of the various HBV phases, HCC, and cirrhosis. Also, nested case-control studies assessing immunological and host genetic factors among persons with active and inactive disease phases, HCC, and cirrhosis could be conducted using these types of cohorts."

Physicians were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group. The intervention group was provided with materials intended to encourage patients to return for counseling and to guide counseling concerning prevention of hepatitis B virus infection. Baseline data on 457 patients at risk for hepatitis B virus infection showed that 7% had received prevention counseling and 2% had begun hepatitis B vaccination. Counseling was least likely to occur in obstetric-gynecologic practices, among uninsured patients, and among patients whose only risk factor was a diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease. After a 6-month intervention period 26% of the intervention group patients and 7% of the control group patients had been counseled (P <.01). Vaccination was more likely among intervention group patients (8% vs <1%; P <.001). The use of tools to identify and counsel patients at risk for sexually transmitted hepatitis B virus infection resulted in increased office-based prevention activities."

Much less research has characterized the patterns of risk behavior that contribute to elevated vulnerability to HIV/AIDS among the mentally ill, as well as psychological, situational, and gender-related influences on risk in this population. One-hundred thirty-four severely mentally ill men and women who reported sexual activity outside of an exclusive relationship or with high-risk partners completed an extensive measure battery concerning HIV risk. Knowledge about HIV was low and sexual risk behavior levels were high in the sample. On average, condoms were used in only 32% of intercourse occasions in the past three months, and nearly one-half of participants reported multiple sexual partners in the same period. Patterns common in the sample were sex associated with substance use; coerced sex, bartering sex for money, food, clothes, or a place to stay; and sex with injection drug user partners. Factors predictive of greater risk were being female, presently being in a relationship, perceiving oneself to be at risk, high levels of alcohol use, and weak risk reduction behavioral intentions. Mental health programs serving severely mentally ill men and women are reaching a population at elevated risk for contracting HIV infection, and can serve as a venue for targeted HIV prevention interventions."

An evaluation of the trend of the HIV-1 infection was attempted by comparing the results of the present study with those obtained from a similar sample studied in 1986 in the same clinic. The overall estimated prevalence of anti-HIV-1 was 1.2% among heterosexual non-drug user subjects and 16.1% among homosexual or bisexual men. The anti-HIV-1 seropositivity was significantly higher in heterosexual subjects who reported sexual contact with intravenous drug users, as compared with those who did not report such exposure (12.5% vs 0.8%, p less than 0.005). Comparing the present data with those of a study conducted in 1986 in the same clinic, a lower prevalence of anti-HIV-1 was found among heterosexual subjects (1.2% in 1989 vs 6.0% in 1986, p less than 0.001). The availability after 1986 of several outpatient facilities attracting seropositive subjects and a change in the sexual behaviour of anti-HIV-1 positive subjects could explain this finding. Twenty percent of the heterosexual subjects and 62% of the homosexual or bisexual men reported consistent use of condoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

This study was undertaken to determine if women hospitalized with pelvic inflammatory disease, in a community endemic for human immunodeficiency virus, were at high risk to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus and if human immunodeficiency virus infections altered their hospital course. One hundred ten women hospitalized with pelvic inflammatory disease in Brooklyn (in a hospital in which 2% of parturients are human immunodeficiency virus seropositive) agreed to human immunodeficiency virus testing; 15 (13.6%) were found to be seropositive. Seropositive women were significantly more likely to have an admission white blood cell count less than 10,000/mm3 (p = 0.001). Human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity was not associated with a higher frequency of other sexually transmitted diseases although there was a trend toward more cases of syphilis among human immunodeficiency virus-infected women. Similarly, although there was no significant difference in rates of operative intervention (26.6% among seropositive and 8.4% among seronegative; p = 0.058), there was a trend toward more surgery among those who were human immunodeficiency virus infected. Women hospitalized with pelvic inflammatory disease, in a community endemic for human immunodeficiency virus, are at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the level of exposure to different risk factors associated with HCV transmission among a group of co-infected patients and to characterize the genotypic distribution of HCV in this cluster. A series of 100 HIV-HCV co-infected patients was analysed. The data to be analysed were collected from specific laboratory tests. Information was collected through a questionnaire. HCV genotyping was carried out by sequencing the 5' non-coding region of HCV. Chi-square and Fischer association tests or Kruskal-Wallis test were used to study the association between HCV transmission-related variables and the established genotypes. In conclusion, exposure to multiple risk factors associated with HCV transmission was common among HIV co-infected patients and an association between HCV genotype 3 and intravenous drug user was observed."
13942,0.005,1.0000,"We have investigated a potential transmission chain of HIV-1 with drug resistance-associated mutations between three individuals over a period of 5 years by use of cloning and sequencing of viral genes, and phenotypic characterization. Viruses containing reverse transcriptase drug resistance-associated mutations were transmitted sequentially between three homosexual men (A, B, and C), and persisted in one individual for at least 4 years, despite intermittent therapy and reduced viral replicative capacity compared with wild-type strains. Clonal analysis of the envelope gene from semen and blood virus showed that the virus transmitted to patient C was more closely related to virus from the semen than the blood of patient B. Our data suggest that HIV variants with drug resistance-associated mutations can persist following primary infection, despite intervening antiretroviral therapy, and subsequently sexually transmitted. We provide ""proof of principle"" that such mutations can therefore become ""fixed"" within the circulating virus pool."
18814,0.005,1.0000,"This longitudinal study examined the impact of drug use and abuse on medication adherence among 150 HIV-infected individuals, 102 who tested urinalysis positive for recent illicit drug use. Medication adherence was tracked over a 6-month period using an electronic monitoring device (MEMS caps). Over the 6-month study drug-positive participants demonstrated significantly worse medication adherence than did drug-negative participants (63 vs. 79%, respectively). Logistic regression revealed that drug use was associated with over a fourfold greater risk of adherence failure. Stimulant users were at greatest risk for poor adherence. Based upon within-participants analyses comparing 3-day adherence rates when actively using versus not using drugs, this appears to be more a function of state rather than trait. These data suggest that it is the acute effects of intoxication, rather than stable features that may be characteristic of the drug-using populace, which leads to difficulties with medication adherence."

7718,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study is to examine the risk factors associated with the development of sensory neuropathy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients in 292 HIV+ patients recruited through a community-based sentinel survey. We determined the clinical and treatment factors associated with the presence of peripheral sensory neuropathy in HIV+ subjects at baseline examination, and at 1-year follow-up. Baseline examination was assessed with a logistic regression analysis controlling for age, education level, history of drug/alcohol use, and anti-retroviral treatment. The risk of developing new peripheral neuropathy at follow-up was determined using a Cox proportional hazard model analysis. At study entry, neuropathy (n=64) was associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) (i.e. ddC), and history of alcohol abuse. After 1-year follow-up, the development of neuropathy was predicted by AIDS, age (older subjects), and NRTI use. These findings indicated that AIDS, age, alcohol abuse/dependence, and anti-retroviral medication use are important predictors of motor/sensory peripheral neuropathy in the HIV infection. The peripheral neurotoxic effect of anti-retroviral medication should be taken into account in the design of long-term therapies."
10593,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to evaluate a medical outreach program that targets unstably housed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. One hundred sixty-one cross-sectional interviews were conducted prior to and after establishing a medical outreach program in single room occupancy hotels. Participants' mean age was 42 years; 58% were men, 95% minority, and 59% active substance users. The postintervention group was more likely to have a regular health care provider (p = 0.02), and take Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis (p = 0.03) and antiretroviral medication (p = 0.02) than the pre-intervention group. Quality of care was more positively perceived in the postintervention group (p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis the postintervention group remained more likely to have a regular provider (OR = 5.3, p = 0.02), take antiretroviral medication (OR = 5.7, p = 0.02), and have a better perception of quality of care (OR = 4.9, p = 0.003). A medical outreach program targeting unstably housed HIV-infected individuals was associated with increased use of regular medical care and improved perceived quality of care."
10550,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to assess the outcomes for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency virus (AIDS) who had esophagectomy done for both benign and malignant conditions. A retrospective chart review of patients with HIV and AIDS undergoing esophagectomy at a rural referral hospital was done for the period of 2009-2014. Patient postoperative complications, outcomes, and follow-up data were charted. All procedures were done by a single lead surgeon. Nine patients met the study criteria, 7 of whom had esophageal cancer, and 2 with strictures. Four patients had received nutritional self-expanding metal stent preoperatively. The mean stent duration was 61 days. Three patients had been on antiretroviral therapy before surgery. Preoperative CD4 counts were available in 7 patients. Eight patients underwent a 3-field esophagectomy and 1 was unresectable. Seven of these patients had successful outcomes, with varying follow-up times. One patient died post procedure while in the hospital. Complications included stricture and anastomotic leak. Although HIV-positive patients face increased risk during surgical procedures, this status should not be a firm contraindication to surgery. Quality nutritional status, antiretroviral use, and overall CD4 count levels remain important parameters in considering surgical treatment for these patients. With careful patient evaluation and planning, esophagectomy in an HIV and AIDS setting is feasible with successful outcomes."

Data on sociodemographic variables, clinical and psychological symptoms, treatment compliance, physician/patient relationship, and psychosocial characteristics were obtained by means of semistructured interviews. Every subject also compiled two self-report questionnaires: Coping Orientations to Problem Experiences (COPE) and Medical Outcomes Study-HIV (MOS-HIV) in order to evaluate the use of coping strategies and quality of life. We found a high rate of adherence to HIV therapies (almost 90% of patients had taken at least 80% of medication in the previous 7 days). No significant differences were found between adherence and nonadherence groups as measured by self-report. Few significant differences were found when data laboratory were used. When a Bonferroni corrected p level of <0.001 was used, only a comparison on Mental Disengagement subscale of COPE was statistically significant."
927,0.005,1.0000,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) have the highest incidence of HIV infection in the United States. One of the contributing factors to HIV spread among this group is the use of crystal methamphetamine (""meth""). The objective was to review the behavioral impact of crystal meth use in HIV-infected MSM and potential treatment options. A systematic review of MEDLINE identified studies that evaluated the clinical effects of crystal meth on the HIV-infected MSM population. Search terms included HIV, methamphetamine, MSM, antiretroviral therapy, adherence, resistance, and treatment. U.S. citations in the English language in peer-reviewed journals until December 2010 were included. The primary author reviewed eligible articles, and relevant data including study design, sample, and outcomes were entered into an electronic data table. The 61 included studies highlight that HIV-infected MSM who use crystal meth are more likely to report high-risk sexual behaviors, incident sexually transmitted infections, and serodiscordant unprotected anal intercourse, compared to HIV-infected MSM who do not use crystal meth. Medication adherence in this population is notably low, which may contribute to transmission of resistant virus. No medications have proven effective in the treatment of crystal meth addiction, and the role of behavioral therapies, such as contingency management are still in question. HIV-infected MSM who abuse crystal meth have worse HIV-related health outcomes. Behavioral interventions have shown variable results in treating crystal meth addiction, and more investigation into rehabilitation options are needed. The results presented support efforts to develop and implement novel interventions to reduce crystal meth use in HIV-infected MSM."
2762,0.005,1.0000,"Our understanding of how community-level context impacts care of persons living with HIV (PLWH), including antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and retention in care, is limited. The objective of this study was to characterize the activity spaces of PLWH from an urban area in Southeastern U.S., where the epidemic is among the nation's highest, and to examine how such activity spaces are associated with daily mood and health behaviors. In this small, pilot study, 11 participants were tracked with a global positioning system (GPS)-enabled application on their smartphones for 2 weeks. Activity spaces were created by connecting GPS points sequentially and adding buffers. Contextual exposure data (e.g., alcohol outlets) were connected to activity spaces. Participants also completed daily diary entry through texts 3 times per day regarding outcomes of substance use behaviors, mood, and medication adherence. This yielded a total of 18,007 GPS polyline records that we aggregated into 258 person-days that captured discrete occasions of exposure to contextual factors and subjects' behaviors and moods. On average, the participants spent 19% of their time awake during the 2-week periods in their residential census tract. Exposure to social and built environment factors such as alcohol outlets was greater when participants were outside versus inside their residential census tract. Exposures on daily routes were also significantly associated with ART adherence, alcohol consumption, and mood. Findings suggest substantial differences between activity spaces and residential contexts. Activity spaces are relevant for PLWH and may impact HIV care and behavioral outcomes such as ART adherence and substance use."
3514,0.005,1.0000,"Symptom clusters are gaining importance given HIV/AIDS patients experience multiple, concurrent symptoms. This study aimed to: determine clusters of patients with similar symptom combinations; describe symptom combinations distinguishing the clusters; and evaluate the clusters regarding patient socio-demographic, disease and treatment characteristics, quality of life (QOL) and functional performance. This was a cross-sectional study of 302 adult HIV/AIDS outpatients consecutively recruited at two teaching and referral hospitals in Uganda. Socio-demographic and seven-day period symptom prevalence and distress data were self-reported using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Schedule. QOL was assessed using the Medical Outcome Scale and functional performance using the Karnofsky Performance Scale. Symptom clusters were established using hierarchical cluster analysis with squared Euclidean distances using Ward's clustering methods based on symptom occurrence. Analysis of variance compared clusters on mean QOL and functional performance scores. Patient subgroups were categorised based on symptom occurrence rates. Five symptom occurrence clusters were identified: Cluster 1 (n=107), high-low for sensory discomfort and eating difficulties symptoms; Cluster 2 (n=47), high-low for psycho-gastrointestinal symptoms; Cluster 3 (n=71), high for pain and sensory disturbance symptoms; Cluster 4 (n=35), all high for general HIV/AIDS symptoms; and Cluster 5 (n=48), all low for mood-cognitive symptoms. The all high occurrence cluster was associated with worst functional status, poorest QOL scores and highest symptom-associated distress. Use of antiretroviral therapy was associated with all high symptom occurrence rate (Fisher's exact=4, P<0.001). CD4 count group below 200 was associated with the all high occurrence rate symptom cluster (Fisher's exact=41, P<0.001). Symptom clusters have a differential, affect HIV/AIDS patients' self-reported outcomes, with the subgroup experiencing high-symptom occurrence rates having a higher risk of poorer outcomes. Identification of symptom clusters could provide insights into commonly co-occurring symptoms that should be jointly targeted for management in patients with multiple complaints."
18198,0.005,1.0000,"49 individuals seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody were studied longitudinally for the relation between in-vitro properties of their sequential HIV isolates and clinical course before and after the development of AIDS. They were classified into three groups according to the syncytium-inducing capacity, replication rate, and host range of their HIV isolates. The most rapid progression to AIDS (median 15 months) and the lowest survival rate following AIDS diagnosis (median survival 12.5 months) were observed in individuals with high-replicating, syncytium-inducing HIV isolates, followed by individuals with high-replicating, non-syncytium-inducing isolates. In contrast, most individuals with low-replicating, non-syncytium-inducing HIV isolates remained symptom-free during the study period (median follow-up until AIDS diagnosis greater than 42 months), and the few individuals from this group in whom AIDS developed were still alive at the end of the study period (median survival greater than 34 months). In addition, AIDS patients from the three groups differed with respect to their symptoms. Zidovudine treatment in the symptom-free period seemed to delay the onset of AIDS in all risk groups, although stabilisation of CD4+ cell numbers was observed only in individuals with non-syncytium-inducing HIV variants."
17141,0.005,1.0000,"This article describes the frequency of alcohol use among HIV-positive patients attending clinical care in sub-Saharan Africa and explores the association between alcohol use, medication adherence, and sexual risk behavior. Data from 3538 patients attending an HIV clinic in Kenya, Tanzania, or Namibia were captured through interview and medical record abstraction. Participants were categorized into three drinking categories: nondrinkers, nonharmful drinkers, and harmful/likely dependent drinkers. A proportional odds model was used to identify correlates associated with categories of alcohol use. Overall, 20% of participants reported alcohol use in the past 6 months; 15% were categorized as nonharmful drinkers and 5% as harmful/likely dependent drinkers. Participants who reported missing a dose of their HIV medications [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.67, 2.49]; inconsistent condom use (AOR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.79); exchanging sex for food, money, gifts, or a place to stay (AOR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.06, 2.32); and having a sexually transmitted infection symptom (AOR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.77) were more likely to be categorized in the higher risk drinking categories. This research highlights the need to integrate alcohol screening and counseling into the adherence and risk reduction counseling offered to HIV-positive patients as part of their routine care. Moreover, given the numerous intersections between alcohol and HIV, policies that focus on reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related risk behavior should be integrated into HIV prevention, care, and treatment strategies."
6397,0.005,1.0000,"We wished to determine the short-term safety and efficacy of a Chinese medicinal herb preparation in treating symptoms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in a University-affiliated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) clinic at a public general hospital. Thirty adults with symptomatic HIV infection, no previous AIDS-defining diagnosis, and CD4+ counts of 0.200-0.499 x 10(9)/L (200-499/mm3) received 28 tablets each day of either a standardized oral preparation of 31 Chinese herbs or a cellulose placebo. Primary outcome measures were changes in life satisfaction, perceived health, and number and severity of symptoms. Other outcomes included adherence, and changes in weight, CD4+ count, depression, anxiety, physical and social function, and mental health. Two placebo- and no herb-treated subjects had mild adverse events (AE). Subjects on both arms reported taking 94% of prescribed tablets. No differences between treatment groups reached the p < 0.05 level. Life satisfaction improved in herb-treated [+0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): +0.29, +1.43] but not in placebo-treated subjects (+0.20, 95% CI -0.35, + 0.75). Number of symptoms was reduced in subjects receiving herbs (-2.2, 95% CI -4.1, -0.3) but not in those receiving placebo (-0.3, 95% CI -3.2, +2.7). There were trends toward greater improvements among herb-treated subjects on all symptom subscales except dermatologic. Believing that one was receiving herbs was strongly associated with reporting that the treatment had helped (p < 0.005), but not with changes in life satisfaction or symptoms. There were improvements in life satisfaction and symptoms among subjects receiving the herbal therapy. Whether Chinese herbs are effective in the management of symptomatic HIV infection can be adequately addressed only by larger trials of longer duration."
1073,0.005,1.0000,"The lung is continuously exposed to infectious and non-infectious agents causing cell activation. Activated cells in the lung such as antigen-presenting cells which harbour HIV may favour this organ as a site for virus production. To test this hypothesis, cells from blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of HIV-infected patients and healthy controls were obtained and the activation of the cells were analysed by measuring the expression of IL-2 receptor, HLA-DR and VLA-1. The HIV-infected individuals were subdivided into 'lung symptomatic' or 'lung asymptomatic' patients, depending on the presence or absence of secondary lung diseases besides HIV. All HIV-infected individuals demonstrated a decreased number of CD4+ lymphocytes in blood; however, normal numbers of these cells were found in BAL. The activation state of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in blood and BAL was higher in lymphocytes from HIV-infected patients compared with controls. The activation state was highest in the lung symptomatic group. Lung symptomatic patients and lung asymptomatic patients with extrapulmonary infections had increased levels of free virus in plasma. Four out of four individuals without or with only low amounts of cell-free HIV in plasma belonged to the symptom-free subgroup. These results suggest that microorganisms other than HIV may promote viral replication via antigen-driven accumulation and activation of CD4+ cells in the lung or other organs, and thus may be responsible for the loss of helper T cells and the progression of the disease."

Predominant manifestations (14%) are: asthenia (100%), emaciation (100%), fever (88%), diarrhea (42%), pulmonary attacks (37%), adenopathies, cutaneous manifestations (35%), neurological manifestations (14%). Some affections call for HIV infection with a significant predictive value: herpes zoster (96%), Kaposi's symptom (68%), mouth candidiasis (71%), pulmonary tuberculosis (56%: as far as some others are concerned, HIV has to be suspected: infant denutrition, acute infections, neurological disorders. Development is severe: 45% of the patients examined died in the 4 months coming after diagnosis. Epidemiology speaking, they are young patients (mean age 27.4 years), neither addicted nor ""doped"", heterosexual with multiple partners, with female prostitution occasionally; sex ratio is 0.95. Recognized transmission by transfusion is the exception (2/504). The transmission due to vaccination or injection is rare and difficult to evaluate. Only radical alteration of sexual behaviour will modify HIV dissemination."
3052,0.005,1.0000,"The three direct-acting antiviral agent (3D) regimen is a novel combination of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) that has proven effective for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Given the potential for coadministration in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, possible drug interactions with antiretroviral drugs must be carefully considered. Four phase 1, multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in healthy volunteers (n = 66). The 3D regimen of 150/100 mg daily paritaprevir/ritonavir, 25 mg daily ombitasvir, and 400 mg twice-daily dasabuvir was administered alone or in combination with 200 mg daily of emtricitabine and 300 mg daily of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF), 25 mg daily of rilpivirine, or 400 mg of raltegravir twice daily. A 2-DAA regimen of 150/100 mg daily paritaprevir/ritonavir and 400 mg of dasabuvir twice daily was also studied in combination with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF at 600/200/300 mg daily, respectively (Atripla; Bristol-Myers Squibb). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from plasma drug concentrations. No clinically significant drug interactions were observed (≤32% change in exposure) between the 3D regimen and that of emtricitabine plus tenofovir DF. Raltegravir exposure was increased up to 134% when the drug was coadministered with the 3D regimen. Although coadministration with rilpivirine was well tolerated in healthy volunteers, observed elevations in rilpivirine exposures may increase the potential for adverse drug reactions. Concomitant use of the 2-DAA regimen and efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF was discontinued owing to poor tolerability and adverse events. No dose adjustment is required during coadministration of raltegravir, tenofovir DF, or emtricitabine with the 3D regimen. Rilpivirine is not recommended and efavirenz is contraindicated for coadministration with the 3D regimen."
9785,0.005,1.0000,"The response to hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy seems to be lower in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients than in HCV-monoinfected individuals. Given that most pivotal trials conducted in coinfected patients have used the combination of pegylated interferon (pegIFN) along with fixed low doses (800 mg/day) of ribavirin (RBV), it is unclear whether HIV itself and/or suboptimal RBV exposure could explain this poorer outcome. Two well-defined end points of early virological response were evaluated in Peginterferon Ribavirina España Coinfección (PRESCO), a multicentre trial in which the combination of pegIFN plus RBV (1000 mg if body weight <75 kg and 1200 mg if >75 kg) was prescribed to coinfected patients. For comparisons, we used unpublished data from early kinetics in two other large trials, one performed in HIV-negative patients [Pegasys International Study Group (PISG)] in which RBV 1000-1200 mg/day was used and another [AIDS Pegasys Ribavirin Coinfection Trial (APRICOT)] in which HIV-positive patients received fixed low RBV doses (800 mg/day). A total of 348 HCV/HIV-coinfected patients from the PRESCO trial were analysed as well as all patients treated with pegIFN plus RBV, who completed 12 weeks of therapy in the comparative studies (435 in PISG and 268 in APRICOT). Negative serum HCV-RNA at week 4 (which has the highest positive predictive value of sustained virological response, SVR) was attained in 33.3%, 31.2% and 13% of treated patients with HCV genotype 1, respectively, in PRESCO, PISG and APRICOT. For HCV genotypes 2/3, responses were 83.7%, 84.2% and 37%, respectively. A decline lower than 2 log(10) at week 12 (which has the highest negative predictive value of SVR) was seen in 25.5%, 19.5% and 37% of HCV genotype-1-infected patients, and in 2.1%, 2.9% and 12% of genotypes-2/3-infected patients, respectively. Prescription of high RBV doses enhances the early virological response to HCV therapy in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients, with results approaching those seen in HCV-monoinfected patients."
18250,0.005,1.0000,"Esophageal candidiasis (EC) is a common and serious complication in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Micafungin has been shown to have dose-related efficacy and to be well tolerated in patients with HIV and EC. This analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind study examined pharmacokinetic parameters of micafungin (dosed at 50, 100, and 150 mg/day) and its metabolites in a subset of patients with HIV and EC. Micafungin exhibited linear, predictable pharmacokinetics, similar to the previous observations in healthy control subjects. Micafungin peak plasma concentration and exposure were increased with dose, while half-life and clearance remained consistent with increasing dose. Plasma concentrations of the metabolites M-1, M-2, and M-5 remained low throughout the study (24 h exposure ≤14% relative to micafungin at end of therapy for each). No differences in micafungin pharmacokinetic parameters were observed according to the sex or race of the patients. The high systemic exposures associated with micafungin 100 and 150 mg/day relative to micafungin 50 mg/day were found to directly correlate with endoscopic clearance. These data provide evidence that the pharmacokinetics of micafungin underlie the dose-related efficacy in patients with HIV and EC."

Seven haemophiliacs, coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), received 9 mega-units (MU) of natural IFN-alpha daily during the first 2 weeks and then three times a week for 22 weeks, all injected subcutaneously. Six patients were receiving zidovudine (AZT) 600 mg day-1 and didanosine (ddI) 200 mg day(-1) during IFN therapy. This treatment was safe and well tolerated. Four patients had no detectable serum HCV-RNA at the end of therapy, but long-term, none of the seven patients achieved a sustained response, i.e. undetectable serum HCV-RNA with persistently normal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 6 months after therapy. IFN did not affect CD4-positive cell counts. Most of our patients had high HCV-RNA loads and/or low CD4 counts, both unfavourable markers for IFN therapy. In conclusion, IFN therapy did not eradicate HCV from haemophiliacs coinfected with HIV."
4694,0.005,1.0000,"Ibalizumab (formerly TNX-355) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds CD4, the primary receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and inhibits the viral entry process. A phase lb multidose study of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of ibalizumab was conducted with 22 HIV-1-infected patients. Nineteen patients were randomized to receive either 10 mg/kg of body weight weekly (arm A) or a 10-mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks (arm B) intravenously for 9 weeks. Three patients were assigned to receive 25 mg/kg every 2 weeks for five doses (arm C). During the study, the patients remained off other antiretrovirals or continued a stable failing regimen. Treatment with ibalizumab resulted in substantial reductions in HIV-1 RNA levels (0.5 to 1.7 log(10)) in 20 of 22 subjects. In most patients, HIV-1 RNA fell to nadir levels after 1 to 2 weeks of treatment and then returned to baseline despite continued treatment. Baseline viral isolates were susceptible to ibalizumab in vitro, regardless of coreceptor tropism. Emerging resistance to ibalizumab was manifested by reduced maximal percent inhibition in a single-cycle HIV infectivity assay. Resistant isolates remained CD4 dependent and were susceptible to enfuvirtide in vitro. Complete coating of CD4(+) T-cell receptors was correlated with serum ibalizumab concentrations. There was no evidence of CD4(+) T-cell depletion in ibalizumab-treated patients. Ibalizumab was not immunogenic, and no serious drug-related adverse effects occurred. In conclusion, ibalizumab administered either weekly or biweekly was safe and well tolerated and demonstrated antiviral activity. Further studies with ibalizumab in combination with standard antiretroviral treatments are warranted."

The study was conducted in 80 centers in North America, Europe, and Australia/New Zealand. A total of 417 patients with histologically documented chronic hepatitis B (histologic activity index [HAI] 9.5-11.0) received famciclovir (500 mg 3 times daily or 1.5 g once daily) or placebo. Famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily significantly reduced HBV DNA and median HAI scores versus placebo. By week 8, median HBV DNA decreased from 1,645 to 283 MEq/mL (famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily) and from 1,147 to 304 MEq/mL (famciclovir 1.5 g once daily), while increasing for placebo (1,617 to 1,685 MEq/mL). Median change in HBV DNA at the end of therapy was -76% (famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily; P <.01) and -60% (famciclovir 1.5 g once daily; P =.25) versus -37% for placebo. Median change in HAI was -1.5 points (famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily; P =.02) and -1.0 point (famciclovir 1.5 g once daily; P =.35) and zero for placebo. Fifty percent of patients receiving famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily (P =.07) and 43% receiving 1.5 g once daily (P =.41) experienced >/=2 points improvement in HAI versus 37% for placebo. Nine percent of patients treated with famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily underwent anti-HBeAg seroconversion with undetectable HBV DNA at end of follow-up versus 3% in the placebo group (P =.05). Famciclovir was well tolerated; the incidence of post-treatment alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations was comparable with placebo. In conclusion, famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily gave modest suppression of viral replication, but translated into significant histologic improvement in median HAI score at 1 year."

The inhibition of TNF-alpha results in decreased immune activation. Beta 2 microglobulin (beta 2 M) has been used as a surrogate marker to study the progression of HIV infection. The objective of this study was to see if use of pentoxiphylline resulted in any decline in beta 2 M levels. Twenty patients with HIV infection who were free of opportunistic infections at the time of inclusion in the study and 18 age and sex matched controls were studied. beta 2 M was measured using an enzyme immunoassay before and four weeks after the start of treatment with pentoxiphylline. Mean levels of beta 2 M before therapy were 1.51 +/- 0.77 mg/l (range 0.78-3.8 mg/l) and were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than the levels among controls [0.72 +/- 0.06 mg/l (range 0.46-0.88 mg/l)]. beta 2 M levels in patients declined to 0.85 +/- 0.22 mg/l (range 0.72-1.0 mg/l) after four weeks of therapy and this was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Use of pentoxiphylline for four weeks results in a significant decline in the levels of beta 2 M suggesting that the level of immune activation is reduced with the therapy."

Six additional HIV-1 p24 antigenemic subjects were treated with zidovudine 500 mg 12-hourly for 76 weeks. Disease progression occurred in 4 subjects, despite sustained reduction of serum HIV-1 p24 antigen levels: Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was diagnosed after 60, 80, 90 and 93 weeks, respectively. The median CD4+ cell count of these 4 men at study entry was 0.2 x 10(9)/l, and it declined to 0.07 x 10(9)/l at the moment AIDS was diagnosed. In 20 subjects no disease progression occurred. The median CD4+ cell count of these 20 men at study entry was 0.4 x 10(9)/l and it was 0.45 x 10(9)/l at the end of the study period. Median serum HIV-1 p24 antigen levels at the end of the study period were 42% lower than at study entry in these 20 subjects. In 5/20 men, an initial decline was followed by a rise in antigen levels to above pretreatment value. Treatment with zidovudine was well tolerated.

Five risk factors had significant effects (p < 0.05) on glucose levels: age, body mass index (BMI), hepatitis C virus/hepatitis B virus (HCV/HBV) co-infection, viral load (VL), and CD4(+) T-lymphocyte count. Fasting blood glucose levels increased with age (0.59 mg/dL/year), decreased with the VL (-4.1 × 10(-6 )mg/dL/number of viral RNA copies) and the CD4(+) T-lymphocyte count (-0.016 mg/dL/cell count). Furthermore, obese patients and those co-infected with HCV/HBV were more prone to develop dysglycaemia having, on average, 15.4 mg/dL and 13.8 mg/dL higher levels, respectively, of fasting blood glucose. Despite an increase of 1.0% and 8.4% in the glucose levels noticed among HIV patients treated with non-nucleotide inhibitors of reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors, respectively, HAART did not prove to be a significant predictor of fasting glucose levels as well as lipodystrophy and male gender. Age, BMI, HCV/HBV co-infection and HIV-related (VL and CD4(+) T-lymphocyte count) factors seem to be the most influential on fasting blood glucose levels in HIV-infected individuals."
820,0.005,1.0000,"As the number of children infected in the HIV epidemic increases, the school nurse can play an important role in ensuring that these children receive comprehensive health care. Compliance with following an immunization program for HIV-infected children is a potential problem for various reasons. Many of these children come from homes where the mother also has HIV/AIDS. She is likely to be involved in keeping her family together, caring for her own health needs, and meeting financial and social needs of her family. Access to health care may be limited. The majority of vaccines administered within the first few months of life are parenteral and consist of inactivated antigens. Children or infants who are immunosuppressed may be unable to respond to the immunogen, thus rendering them susceptible to many infectious diseases. Heterosexual transmission and pregnancy compound the problems of HIV/AIDS (Flynn, 1994). Compliance following an immunization schedule becomes a greater challenge when working with the adolescent population. Parents may not understand that the risk of receiving vaccine, MMR for example, is less than the risk of severe complications associated with the diseases themselves. Coordination of care between the child, parent, and school district personnel is imperative to minimize the risk of further health-related problems of the HIV-infected child. Encouraging regular immunizations can decrease the child's susceptibility to infection, and administering medications properly can enhance the benefits of the drug therapy. An excellent resource for answering questions of school nurses related to HIV/AIDS is the National Pediatric and Family HIV Resource Center; contact Elaine Gross, R.N., M.S. at 1-800-362-0071."
651,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is vital for HIV-infected adolescents for survival and quality of life. However, this age group faces many challenges to remain adherent. We used multiple data sources (role-play, focus group discussions (FGD), and in-depth interviews (IDI)) to better understand adherence barriers for Rwandan adolescents. Forty-two HIV positive adolescents (ages 12-21) and a selection of their primary caregivers were interviewed. All were perinatally-infected and received (cART) for ≥ 12 months. Topics discussed during FGDs and IDIs included learning HIV status, disclosure and stigma, care and treatment issues, cART adherence barriers."
6044,0.005,1.0000,"The costs and benefits of screening blood donors for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are assessed. Total costs, including testing, discarding processed blood, marginal donor recruiting, notifying and evaluating positive donors, are $36,234,000 annually for 10 million donors in 1986. Screening these donors will prevent 292 cases of transfusion-transmitted acquired immune deficiency syndrome (TT-AIDS), saving the costs of therapy and loss of earnings for total benefits of $43,490,480, a benefit:cost ratio of 1.2:1. Net economic benefits of $0.73 per donor will arise from the program. Calculated benefits will rise as increased numbers of infected recipients are diagnosed with longer follow-up or as partially effective therapy increases the cost of caring for patients with AIDS. Changes in test sensitivity, follow-up procedures, estimated value of life, and testing costs will also alter these projections, but none as dramatically as a change in the overall specificity of the screening process. The cost per case of TT-AIDS prevented, $124,089, and cost per year of life extended, $10,885, are comparable to costs of other screening programs."
5797,0.005,1.0000,"With the advent of potent antiretroviral therapy and the increase in life expectancy of pediatric patients infected with HIV, the quest for the promotion of enhanced quality of life should currently be the main focus in care of children with HIV/Aids. The scope of this study was to validate the Scale of Children's Quality of Life in a group of children infected with HIV receiving clinical care in Aids Service Units in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This scale consists of 26 questions and was tested on 100 children, with ages varying between 4 and 12, and their respective parents or guardians. Statistical analysis was conducted using canonical correlation and confidence interval analysis and the X² test. The results showed that the cut-off point obtained was 49; the internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha was 0.73 for the children and 0.67 for parents or guardians. The response profile revealed marked satisfaction with aspects such as vacations and birthdays, though less satisfaction with items including hospitalization and playing alone. The conclusion was that the scale revealed satisfactory psychometric measurements, proving to be a reliable, consistent, valid and recommended instrument for measuring the quality of life of children infected with HIV."
2731,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with human herpesvirus type 8 and with human T-cell leukaemia virus type-1 shows strong geographic variations. We conducted this study to assess prevalence and risk factors for human herpesvirus type 8 infection in Havana City, Cuba. Information and residual serum samples already collected for a hospital based case-control study were used. A total of 379 individuals (267 males and 112 females; median age=63 years) were evaluated. Antibodies to the lytic antigen of human herpesvirus type 8 were detected by using an immunofluorescence assay, while human T-cell leukaemia virus type-1 serology was performed by means of an ELISA test (alpha Biotech). Overall, 64 subjects (16.9%, 95% confidence interval: 13.1-20.0) were positive for human herpesvirus type 8 antibodies. Human herpesvirus type 8 seroprevalence significantly increased with age (odds ratio=1.9 for >/=65 vs <55 years), and was twice as frequent in blacks than in whites. No association emerged with gender, socio-economic indicators, family size, history of sexually transmitted disease, sexual behaviour. Overall, 16 persons had anti-human T-cell leukaemia virus type-1 antibodies (4.2%, 95% confidence interval: 2.2-6.4). No relationship emerged between human T-cell leukaemia virus type-1 and human herpesvirus type 8 serostatus. The study findings indicate that human herpesvirus type 8 infection is relatively common in Havana City, Cuba, suggesting that Cuba may represent an intermediate endemical area. Sexual transmission does not seem to play a major role in the spread human herpesvirus type 8 infection."
4781,0.005,1.0000,"The quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) provides a precise minimal estimate of the reservoir of resting CD4(+) T-cell infection (resting cell infection [RCI]). However, the variability of RCI over time during antiretroviral therapy (ART), relevant to assess potential effects of latency-reversing agents or other interventions, has not been fully described. We performed QVOA on resting CD4(+) T cells obtained via leukapheresis from 37 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients receiving stable suppressive ART for a period of 6 years. Patients who started ART during acute (n = 17) or chronic (n = 20) HIV infection were studied once HIV RNA levels were <50 copies/mL for ≥ 6 months. Using random effects analysis of 160 RCI measurements, we found that RCI declined significantly over time (P < .001), with an estimated mean half-life of 3.6 years (95% confidence interval, 2.3-8.1 years), remarkably consistent with findings of prior studies. There was no evidence of more rapid decay in acute versus chronic HIV infection (P = .99) for patients suppressed ≥ 6 months. RCI was reliably estimated with longitudinal measurements generally showing < 2-fold variation from the previous measure. When QVOA is performed in this format, RCI decreases of >6-fold were rare. We suggest that a 6-fold decline is a relevant threshold to reliably identify effects of antilatency interventions on RCI."
692,0.005,1.0000,"In the past decade, the increased number of persons being treated for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has placed an enormous burden on specialty clinics. This is especially true in Los Angeles, where care of patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been termed a ""crisis"" situation. Especially in its early stages, HIV disease can be appropriately managed by primary care physicians who provide patients with medical and psychological counseling and refer them to specialists when major AIDS-related complications develop. Physicians completing their training as recently as 5 years ago, however, received little systematic preparation in the care of HIV-infected patients and thus may lack important skills such as the ability to recognize opportunistic infections early in their course. By means of a 1-week intensive preceptorship in a high-volume AIDS clinic, we are preparing community physicians to assume a more active role in providing care for this growing patient population. In the preceptorship, participants receive one-on-one training from specialists in infectious diseases, pulmonary diseases, and hematology and oncology, as well as from internists and family physicians. Evaluation of the clinical experience demonstrated a greater level of confidence on the part of program participants in treating HIV-infected patients and showed that participants screen and test high-risk patients in their practices and devote a substantial proportion of their practices to caring for HIV-infected patients."
3904,0.005,1.0000,"Access to free antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Sub-Saharan Africa has been steadily increasing over the past decade. However, the success of large-scale ART programmes depends on timely diagnosis and early initiation of HIV care. This study characterizes late presenters to HIV care in Santiago (Cape Verde) between 2004 and 2011, and identifies factors associated with late presentation for care. We defined late presentation as persons presenting to HIV care with a CD4 count below 350 cells/mm³. An unmatched case-control study was conducted using socio-demographic and behavioural data of 368 individuals (191 cases and 177 controls) collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire, comparing HIV patients late and early presented to care. Logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Results show that 51.9% were late presenters for HIV. No differences were found in gender distribution, marital status, or access to health services between cases and controls. Participants who undertook an HIV test by doctor indication were more likely to present late compared with those who tested for HIV by their own initiative. Also, individuals taking less time to initiate ART are more likely to present late. This study highlights the need to better understand reasons for late presentation to HIV care in Cape Verde. People in older age groups should be targeted in future approaches focused on late presenters to HIV care."
7621,0.005,1.0000,"A previous cohort study demonstrated a relation between neutropenia and bacteremia due to gram-negative bacilli among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To explore further the relation between neutropenia and bacteremia due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa among HIV-infected patients, controlling for confounding factors, the authors conducted a nested case-control study with matching and risk-set sampling of controls. The cohort included 1,645 HIV-infected patients followed at the University of California, San Diego, Medical Center in San Diego, California, between 1991 and 1995. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was summarized as mean ANC during the 7-day interval preceding the index date of bacteremia. Covariates were ascertained by medical record review. The matching ratio was 6:1 (controls:cases). Odds ratios were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Forty-four incident cases of bacteremia were identified. After adjustment for covariates, the estimated odds ratio for the effect of neutropenia (ANC=500 vs. >500/microl) during the 7 days preceding the index date was 8.1 (95% confidence interval confidence interval 1.5-43.1). The rate of bacteremia due to E. coli, K. pneumoniae, or P. aeruginosa is increased eightfold if the average current-week ANC is less than or equal to 500/microl compared with more than 500/microl."
18549,0.005,1.0000,"There is great interindividual variability in HIV-1 viral setpoint after seroconversion, some of which is known to be due to genetic differences among infected individuals. Here, our focus is on determining, genome-wide, the contribution of variable gene expression to viral control, and to relate it to genomic DNA polymorphism. RNA was extracted from purified CD4+ T-cells from 137 HIV-1 seroconverters, 16 elite controllers, and 3 healthy blood donors. Expression levels of more than 48,000 mRNA transcripts were assessed by the Human-6 v3 Expression BeadChips (Illumina). Genome-wide SNP data was generated from genomic DNA using the HumanHap550 Genotyping BeadChip (Illumina). We observed two distinct profiles with 260 genes differentially expressed depending on HIV-1 viral load. There was significant upregulation of expression of interferon stimulated genes with increasing viral load, including genes of the intrinsic antiretroviral defense. Upon successful antiretroviral treatment, the transcriptome profile of previously viremic individuals reverted to a pattern comparable to that of elite controllers and of uninfected individuals. Genome-wide evaluation of cis-acting SNPs identified genetic variants modulating expression of 190 genes. Those were compared to the genes whose expression was found associated with viral load: expression of one interferon stimulated gene, OAS1, was found to be regulated by a SNP (rs3177979, p = 4.9E-12); however, we could not detect an independent association of the SNP with viral setpoint. Thus, this study represents an attempt to integrate genome-wide SNP signals with genome-wide expression profiles in the search for biological correlates of HIV-1 control. It underscores the paradox of the association between increasing levels of viral load and greater expression of antiviral defense pathways. It also shows that elite controllers do not have a fully distinctive mRNA expression pattern in CD4+ T cells. Overall, changes in global RNA expression reflect responses to viral replication rather than a mechanism that might explain viral control."
1473,0.005,1.0000,"Epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic features of 77 consecutive HIV-infected non-European Union immigrants were compared according to gender. Immigrants (from Sub-Saharan Africa in around 60% of cases) represented 7.9% of our patient cohort at the end of 2002. Compared with male patients, females were more numerous, significantly younger (p.0001), and experienced sexual exposure versus drug addiction (p.02), while no difference was observed according to place of origin. A negative HIV serology preceding immigration was available for five women and four males only, while HIV disease was known before migration in 14 men versus 7 women (p.04). The tendency towards a shorter known history of HIV infection (p.05) of females versus males may be responsible for a lower incidence of AIDS among women (p.02). The use of antiretroviral treatment was matched by time and selected regimens, but compliance proved significantly greater in females versus males (p.0001), and women had less need of a regimen switch due to poor tolerability or refusal (73.2% versus 61.1%); the latter could be responsible for a greater mean CD4+ count (p.02), and lower mean plasma viremia (p.0001), although no difference was found when considering viral suppression rate (70.7% among women, 52.8% among men). Surveillance studies and prospective therapeutic trials are strongly warranted, in order to have a reliable assessment of HIV-infected immigrated people, to check the efficacy of preventive measures, obtain validated data about the clinical, virologic, and immunological evolution and outcome of HIV infection undergoing HAART, and to evaluate the frequency and role of eventual untoward effects of pharmacologic treatment."
17221,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the effect of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection on subsequent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HIV antibody was sought in homosexual men who developed HBV infection during a hepatitis B vaccine trial. Among 134 unvaccinated HIV-1-negative men, 7% became HBV carriers, 64% had viremia, and 42% had clinical illness. Among vaccinated HIV-1-negative men, HBV infection severity decreased with number of vaccine doses administered. When adjusted for prior hepatitis B vaccination status, persons with HIV-1 infection preceding HBV infection had a significantly higher risk of developing HBV carriage, viremia, prolonged ALT elevation, and clinical illness. Among HIV-1-infected men, the risk of HBV carriage was increased in unvaccinated persons (21%) and those who failed to respond to vaccination (31%) and further increased in those who received vaccine doses at the time they developed new HBV infection (56%-80%), suggesting inactivated hepatitis B vaccine may temporarily impair the immune response to HBV infection in HIV-1-infected persons. HIV-1 infection was also associated with reduced alanine aminotransferase elevations during the first 36 months of follow-up of men who became HBV carriers."
2255,0.005,1.0000,"This study focuses on factors that predispose young persons aged 15-24 years in Zimbabwe to infection from HIV. Using the Mosley and Chen framework, multivariate modelling was used to assess the effect of demographic, socio-economic and behavioural factors on the risk of HIV infection among this target group. The study utilised data from the Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) conducted in 2005-06. Only the variables that were significant in the bivariate analysis were included in the multivariate binary logistic regression. Young females aged 15-24 years are associated with a significant two-fold elevated risk of HIV infection relative to their male peers (p < 0.000). Young persons aged 15-24 years who were divorced, widowed or not living together have significantly elevated risk compared with their never-married counterparts, OR = 5.267 (p = 0.000); OR = 4.323 (p = 0.000) and OR = 3.272 (p = 0.000), respectively. Young persons whose age at first sexual intercourse was less than 14 years are significantly associated with 2.696 times more risk of HIV infection relative to their peers whose age at first sexual intercourse was 20-24 years (p = 0.000). Young persons aged 15-24 years with two or more sex partners in the past 12 months preceding the 2005-06 ZDHS survey had a significantly elevated risk of HIV infection of 1.568 times relative to their counterparts with no sex partners in the same period of time. Great challenges still exist for the control of HIV and AIDS among young persons in Zimbabwe. HIV prevention programmes targeted at young persons aged 15-24 years should provide invigorated focus on marital status, age at sexual debut, number of sexual partners, sexually transmitted infections and condom use so as to mitigate these predisposing factors for HIV infection."
189,0.005,1.0000,"This study aimed to investigate the association between the polymorphisms of IL-15 gene and susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the Chinese Han population. A total of 234 patients with chronic HBV infection and 150 age- and sex-matched healthy controls in the Chinese population were enrolled in this case-control study. Genotyping of ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-15 gene was carried out via Sequenom MassARRAY system. The association analysis demonstrated that SNP rs3806798 (A/T) had a significant difference in the distribution between patients and healthy controls (P = 0.033). Moreover, a significantly increased risk of HBV infection was found to be associated with IL-15 rs3806798 A allele among male patients and HBeAg-negative patients, compared with IL-15 rs3806798 T allele (P = 0.003; P = 0.046, respectively). Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that haplotype ATAGG (rs3806798, rs12508866, rs1519551, rs6819823 and rs2857261, respectively) in block 1 was significantly associated with HBV infection (P = 0.022). In conclusion, we found an association between IL-15 rs3806798 and the risk of chronic HBV infection in a sample of Chinese Han population."
6912,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are highly prevalent, often co-occurring infections among drug users. We examined HBV prevalence and risk behaviour patterns among a group of HCV-negative heroin and/or cocaine users in order to understand HBV risk and prevention opportunities among this unique group. Of 164 people enrolled, 44% had injected drugs. Overall, 24% of participants tested positive for exposure to HBV; drug injectors (28%) were only slightly and not significantly (P=0.287) more likely to test positive than those who had never injected drugs (21%). HBV exposure was significantly associated with multiple indicators of greater sex risk. HBV status was not associated with any demographic characteristic, but participants who reported longer duration of cocaine use were significantly less likely to test positive to exposure for HBV. It appears that HBV risk among HCV-negative drug users in this cohort is primarily due to sexual behaviour."
7679,0.005,1.0000,"Persons who inject drugs (PWID) shoulder the greater part of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic in the USA. PWID are also disproportionately affected by limited access to health care and preventative services. We sought to compare current health care coverage, HCV, and HIV testing history, hepatitis A and B vaccination coverage, and co-occurring substance use among PWID in two US cities with similar estimated numbers of PWID. Using data from the 2009 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system in Denver (n = 428) and Seattle (n = 507), we compared HCV seroprevalence and health care needs among PWID. Overall, 73 % of participants who tested for HCV antibody were positive. Among those who were HCV antibody-positive, vaccination coverage for hepatitis A and B was low (43 % in Denver and 34 % in Seattle) and did not differ significantly from those who were antibody-negative. Similarly, participation in alcohol or drug treatment programs during the preceding 12 months was not significantly higher among those who were HCV antibody-positive in either city. Significantly fewer participants in Denver had health care coverage compared to Seattle participants (45 vs. 67 %, p < 0.001). However, more participants in Seattle reported being disabled for work and, thus, more likely to be receiving health care coverage through the federal Medicaid program. In both cities, the vast majority of those who were aware of their HCV infection reported not receiving treatment (90 % in Denver and 86 % in Seattle). Our findings underscore the need to expand health care coverage and preventative medical services for PWID. Furthermore, our findings point to the need to develop comprehensive and coordinated care programs for infected individuals. "
7322,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major cause of chronic liver disease in hemophiliacs. To determine the effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the natural history of HCV infection, we evaluated end-stage liver disease (ESLD) in 157 hemophiliacs (85 HIV positive and 72 HIV negative) with HCV infection for an average of 24 years. After adjusting for age at HCV infection, past or current hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, and history of alcohol abuse, we determined that the rate of ESLD was significantly greater among HIV-positive than among HIV-negative hemophiliacs (relative risk [RR], 3.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-11.09), as was the adjusted RR for death due to ESLD (RR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.19-12.16). Among HIV-positive hemophiliacs, crude RR for ESLD was lower, but not significantly so, with antiretroviral treatment (RR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03-1.14; P=.069) and increased with each decade of HCV infection (RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.42-3.59; P=.0006) and HIV infection (RR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.36-3.49; P=.0013).

2436,0.005,1.0000,"Seventy-six of 77 consecutive patients with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive acute hepatitis were reevaluated using anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV), anti-hepatitis D virus (HDV), and IgM anti-hepatitis B core (HBc) testing. Anti-HCV and/or anti-HDV was found in 32 patients (42%). The presence of these markers was significantly associated with intravenous drug abuse (p less than 10(-6). Sixty-nine patients were IgM anti-HBc-positive, of whom two (3%) (95% confidence limits, 1-12%) became chronic HBsAg carriers with histologically verified chronic liver disease; both were anti-HCV and anti-HDV-negative. Among the remaining 67 IgM anti-HBc-positive patients 8 had HBV and HDV co-infection, 3 had HBV and HCV co-infection, and 1 had HBV, HCV, and HDV co-infection. Twenty-two had evidence of preceding or past HCV infection; two developed chronic active hepatitis in spite of HBsAg clearance. Seven patients with IgM anti-HBc negative. One was a chronic HBsAg carrier with HDV superinfection. One had subclinical acute HBV infection and became a chronic HBsAg carrier. In a further two patients reactivation of replication in a chronic HBV infection could not be disregarded. Three patients could not be classified; all had acute recent onset of symptoms, cleared HBsAg within 6 months, but lacked IgM anti-HBc. It is concluded that HCV and HDV superinfections in HBV carriers mimicking acute HBV infection with chronic evolution are rarely encountered in the present population in spite of high frequency of both HCV and HDV markers."
17938,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis G virus (HGV) RNA and anti-E2 glycoprotein antibody (E2Ab) seroprevalence was studied in 58 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected mothers (34 injecting drug users [IDUs] and 24 with risky sexual behavior [RSB]) and their children (median age, 5 days; range, 1-27). Twelve women (20.6%) were RNA- and 20 (34.4%) E2Ab-positive. Seroprevalence was similar in the IDU and RSB groups and high in RSB partners of IDU men. Five (41.6%) children of RNA-positive mothers were HGV-infected, at a median age of 5 days (range, 1-27), independent of maternal CD4 T lymphocyte numbers, mode of delivery, and HIV-1 transmission; no other child at risk became RNA-positive subsequently. No HGV-infected child (follow-up, 16 months; range, 12-52) showed increased liver enzyme levels; 3 children cleared RNA and E2Ab-seroconverted after 10-48 months. Thus, in HIV-1-infected women, HGV infection is common and also sexually transmitted, and clearance may be impaired. Mother-to-child transmission is frequent and occurs antenatally; children remain long infected without evident disease."
1735,0.005,1.0000,"N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) catalyzes protein N-myristoylation. It has been suggested that the isozyme NMT1 enhances the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). However, the details of the mechanism by which NMT1 does so remain unclear. In this study, we investigated NMT1-binding proteins by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. As a result, several RNA-binding proteins including ribosomal proteins, NMT isozymes, and hnRNP A2/B1 were observed to bind to NMT1, as mediated mainly by RNA. Interestingly, only hRNP A2/B1 was found to associate with NMT1 without mediation by RNA. It was also suggested that hnRNP A2/B1 contributes to the formation of complexes of high molecular weights involving NMT1. Knockdown of hnRNP A2/B1 resulted in the enhancement of viral replication with an increase in the expression level of viral RNA in HIV-1-producing cells. On the other hand, knockdown of NMT1 resulted in the attenuation of viral replication with the decrease in the expression level of viral RNA in HIV-1-producing cells. Additionally, overexpression of NMT1 induced the enhancement of viral replication with the increase in the expression level of the viral RNA. These findings suggest that both NMT1 and hnRNP A2/B1 take part in the regulation of HIV-1 RNA expression through their mutual opposite effects on the viral RNA expression in HIV-1-producing cells. "
1250,0.005,1.0000,"Robust activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gene expression occurs upon superinfection with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a common AIDS-associated pathogen. Though the mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain unknown, several KSHV-encoded factors have been reported to stimulate HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) activity. Here, we systematically evaluated the ability of KSHV tegument proteins to modulate the activation of an integrated HIV-1 LTR and revealed that the most potent individual activator is ORF45. ORF45 directs an increase in RNA polymerase II recruitment to the HIV-1 LTR, leading to enhanced transcriptional output. ORF45 is a robust activator of the p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSK), and we found that this activity is necessary but not sufficient to increase transcription from the LTR. Of the three widely expressed RSK isoforms, RSK2 appears to be selectively involved in LTR stimulation by both KSHV ORF45 and HIV-1 Tat. However, constitutively active RSK2 is unable to stimulate the LTR, suggesting that ORF45 may preferentially direct this kinase to a specific set of targets. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel transcriptional activation function for KSHV ORF45 and highlight the importance of RSK2 in shaping the transcriptional environment during infection."

HIV-infected individuals (n = 97) had significantly greater adjusted BMD decline than controls (n = 614) during the first 96 weeks of ART. Subsequently, the rate of BMD decline slowed in HIV-infected individuals but remained greater than the rate of decline in HIV-uninfected individuals at the lumbar spine but not at the hip. In HIV-infected individuals after 96 weeks, no HIV- or treatment-related characteristic was associated with BMD loss, but lower lean body mass was associated with greater BMD loss at both lumbar spine and hip."

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of tenofovir DF in adolescents with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adolescents 12 to <18 years of age with CHB were randomized to tenofovir DF 300 mg (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) once daily for 72 weeks. The primary endpoint was virologic response (HBV DNA <400 copies/mL) at week 72. One hundred six patients were enrolled; 101 patients completed 72 weeks of treatment. At baseline, 91% of patients were hepatitis B e antigen-positive and 85% had prior exposure to HBV therapy. A virologic response was observed in 89% (46/52) of patients who received tenofovir DF and 0% (0/54) of patients who received placebo (P < 0.001). Treatment response was not affected by prior HBV treatment. Furthermore, no resistance to tenofovir DF developed through week 72. Among patients with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level greater than the upper limit of normal at baseline, normalization of ALT occurred in 74% of patients receiving tenofovir DF and 31% of patients receiving placebo (P < 0.001). The rate of grade 3/4 adverse events was higher among patients treated with placebo (24%) than patients treated with tenofovir DF (10%). No patients met the safety endpoint of a 6% decrease in spine bone mineral density at week 72."
2054,0.005,1.0000,"Bone disorders such as osteopenia and osteoporosis have been recently reported in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but their etiology remains still unknown. The prevalence estimates vary widely among the different studies and can be affected by concomitant factors such as the overlapping of other possible conditions inducing bone loss as lypodystrophy, advanced HIV-disease, advanced age, low body weight or concomitant use of other drugs. All the reports at the moment available in the literature showed a higher than expected prevalence of reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV-infected subjects both naïve and receiving potent antiretroviral therapy compared to healthy controls. This controversial can suggest a double role played by both antiretroviral drugs and HIV itself due to immune activation and/or cytokines disregulation. An improved understanding of the pathogenesis of bone disorders can result in better preventative and therapeutic measures. However, the clinical relevance and the risk of fractures remains undefined in HIV-population. The clinical management of osteopenia and osteoporosis in HIV-infected subjects is still being evaluated. Addressing potential underlying bone disease risk factors (e.g., smoking and alcohol intake, use of corticosteroids, advanced age, low body weight), evaluating calcium and vitamin D intake, and performing dual x-ray absorptiometry in HIV-infected individuals who have risk factors for bone disease can be important strategies to prevent osteopenia and osteoporosis in this population. The administration of bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate), with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, may be a reasonable and effective option to treat osteoporosis in these subjects."

We examine the protective effect of dually active antiretroviral therapy (DAART) for HIV/HBV (tenofovir, lamivudine, and emtricitabine) in a large cohort encompassing heterosexuals, men who have sex with men, and intravenous drug users who are HIV infected yet susceptible to HBV, with comprehensive follow-up data about risky behavior and immunological profiles."
12209,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected health-care workers (HCWs) have infected patients during medical procedures. In many countries HBV-infected HCWs are restricted in performing exposure prone procedures based on either HBeAg status or serum HBV DNA level. To prevent loss of skilled HCWs and to minimize transmission risk, highly viraemic HCWs can be offered antiviral therapy. Nucleoside analogues have proven to be effective in reducing transmission of HIV and HBV in the setting of vertical mother-to-infant transmission. Following the same rationale, suppression of viral load in HBV-infected HCWs could minimize the risk of doctor-to-patient transmission to such an extent that job modifications are no longer indicated. To limit the risk of drug resistance, the use of combination therapy is advocated. We describe two chronic HBV-infected HCWs treated with antiviral therapy, eventually leading to well-tolerated and highly effective combination therapy with lamivudine and tenofovir, with continuation of medical practice."

All study subjects received ADV with or without NAs due to prior LAM resistance, and were then switched to TDF-based rescue therapy due to SOR (hepatitis B virus DNA >20 IU/ml after at least 6 months of therapy). A total of 125 patients were eligible. The overall cumulative proportion of complete virologic response (CVR) was 64 of 74 patients (86.5%) at 48 weeks of treatment. During the follow-up period of 48 weeks, there was no significant difference in CVR rate (P = 0.750) between the TDF monotherapy (n = 18) and the TDF with NA groups (n = 107). Patients with ADV genotypic mutations showed inferior antiviral responses to TDF compared with the patients without ADV genotypic mutations, but this was not statistically significant (P = 0.069). Partial virological response to prior ADV therapy showed higher CVR rates compared to patients with non-response at 12 weeks (P = 0.013), but there was no significant difference after 24 (P = 0.076) and 48 weeks (P = 0.198) of treatment. TDF monotherapy is as effective as TDF plus NA combination therapy in patients with SOR to ADV-based rescue therapy and LAM resistance. TDF, with or without NAs, was effective even in cases of ADV resistance."

Only 64 cases of proven PT were recorded during the 33-month survey. The patients were similar to other patients with AIDS in terms of age, sex, and risk factors for HIV infection. PT occurred mainly in patients with advanced immunodeficiency (mean [+/- SD] CD4+ lymphocyte count, 40 +/- 75/mm3). Clinical features of PT usually include fever, cough and dyspnea; the associated radiological findings were mainly diffuse interstitial infiltrates. Serological data were uninformative. The treatment for PT was the same as that for cerebral toxoplasmosis. A clinical response was observed for 47% of patients, 23% of whom relapsed. Twenty-four patients (37%) died of toxoplasmosis, and 17 (27%) died of other causes. The median survival time was 150 days. We conclude that PT is an infrequent but severe infection in HIV-patients in France."

Illicit drug use, number of female partners, having stable partners, and STD diagnosis were associated with unsafe sex. Interventions to reduce risk taking behavior among HIV-positive men under care in these settings are urgent, especially among heterosexual stable couples."
10764,0.005,1.0000,"Few studies have explored hospitalization outcome differences between patients who are seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) compared to HIV-seronegative patients with acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs). The aim of this study was to explore in-hospital AMI mortality risk in seropositive and seronegative patients. A secondary analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1997 to 2006 was conducted. This sample allows the approximation of all United States hospitalizations. All AMI encounters with and without co-occurring HIV were identified using appropriate International Classification of Diseases and procedure codes. Descriptive and Cox proportional-hazards analyses were then conducted to estimate mortality differences between seropositive and seronegative patients while adjusting for demographic, clinical, hospital, and care factors. The results demonstrated higher AMI hospitalization mortality hazard in seropositive compared to seronegative patients after adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity, medical co-morbidities, hospital type, and number of in-hospital procedures (HR 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.87, p = 0.04). Stratified analysis demonstrated greater although not statistically significant mortality hazard for non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in seropositive compared to seronegative patients. Typical AMI care procedures occurred at significantly lower rates in seropositive versus seronegative patients, including thrombolytic and anticoagulant agents (18% vs 22%), coronary arteriography (48% vs 63%), left cardiac catheterization (52% vs 66%), and coronary artery bypass graft (6% vs 14%). In conclusion, additional mortality burden and lower procedure rates occur for HIV-seropositive patients receiving AMI care. Health care providers should be alert to the increased mortality burden when treating seropositive patients with AMI."
5966,0.005,1.0000,"Although the use of combination antiretroviral therapy has resulted in spectacular improvements in morbidity and mortality of HIV-1 infected patients, a need for the development of antiretroviral compounds with new mechanisms of action remains. Maraviroc (Celsentri(®); ViiV Healthcare, Middlesex, UK) is the only drug of the class of chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 antagonists registered for treatment for HIV-1-infected antiretroviral therapy-experienced patients. Registration was based on the MOTIVATE-1 and -2 studies, which compared the efficacy and tolerability of maraviroc in combination with optimized background therapy with placebo. The aim of this paper is to review the MOTIVATE studies and to discuss issues related to maraviroc therapy in clinical practice such as assessment of HIV-1 coreceptor tropism."
13926,0.005,1.0000,"The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has extended the healthy lifespan of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); deaths among people with AIDS declined for the first time in 1996, after the institution of this therapeutic approach. As the life expectancy of HIV-infected patients increases, greater attention will need to be focused on the recognition and management of potentially severe concurrent illnesses that may increase their mid- to long-range morbidity and mortality. The incidence of infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) is increased among patients with HIV disease, reflecting shared epidemiological risks. HCV not only may have an impact on the health status of HIV-infected patients but also may decrease their quality of life and increase their health care costs. Although clinicians have been reluctant to treat viral hepatitis C in the HIV-infected population, this therapeutic nihilism is unwarranted. The majority of studies have concluded that treatment of hepatitis C in HIV-infected patients results in an initial efficacy and long-term response similar to those in the HIV-seronegative population. Furthermore, treatment of HCV infection in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients may improve tolerance for antiretroviral medications. Physicians caring for patients with HIV infection require up-to-date information to make rational decisions regarding HCV coinfection to ensure that morbidity and mortality are minimized and that quality of life and medical care costs are optimized."
7917,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy has tremendous potential to alter the HIV-1 epidemic trajectory. However, gaps in the continuum from HIV diagnosis, through linkage to care and uptake and adherence to antiretroviral therapy, are substantially limiting to the actual impact. In the United States, gaps in HIV diagnosis and care are greatest among African Americans, substance users, and persons living below the poverty line. Globally, HIV diagnosis rates are highest in women, but HIV incidence may be declining more rapidly in men, due to lower transmission rates from female partners and greater uptake of medical male circumcision. The 2012 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections explored gaps in the continuum of care and potential strategies to address them, and also addressed the disparate results from preexposure prophylaxis efficacy trials. The role of injectable contraceptives in increasing the risk of HIV acquisition in women was debated, as was the potential harm that could arise from limiting this contraceptive method due to increased maternal mortality. Similarly, the potential benefits and harms of serosorting were explored. Investigators explored scale-up of prevention strategies to have the biggest and most cost-effective impact on the global epidemic."
1911,0.005,1.0000,"Resistance to available antiretroviral (ARV) agents is of increasing concern, and development of novel agents that address this problem has been identified as a major public health priority. As ARV resistance becomes more prevalent with extended use of existing agents, individuals with HIV infection resistant to all three traditional classes of ARVs, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs), find themselves increasingly limited with regard to effective treatment options. The need for tolerable new drug regimens that effectively suppress viral replication while being simple to adhere to is increasingly pressing. This article reviews the epidemiology of antiretroviral drug resistance, the factors that contribute to the emergence of resistance, and presents data that support the need for early detection of resistance and maximal virologic suppression in order to delay treatment failure and reduce mortality. Healthcare providers are encouraged to optimize therapy through the use of new agents from existing drug classes, which can minimize cross-resistance, as well as agents with novel mechanisms of action, in order to realize the potential for greater viral containment and to forestall development of resistance mutations. This article evaluates several emerging therapies that are in late-stage clinical development and promise to expand treatment options for highly treatment-experienced patients with the goal of improving outcomes for HIV-infected individuals whose options for sustained antiviral efficacy are increasingly limited."
2084,0.005,1.0000,"In 1989, the United States Public Health Service convened a Task Force of experts to consider the expanding knowledge base about prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) among adults and adolescents (greater than or equal to 13 years of age) with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This Task Force concluded that the morbidity, mortality, and cost due to PCP could be substantially reduced by appropriate use of antipneumocystis prophylaxis in subgroups of HIV-infected patients known to be at high risk, and developed recommendations for the administration of prophylactic regimens (1). The recommendations state that CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts should be monitored prospectively at 3- to 6-month intervals and prophylaxis should be instituted when patients become immunologically susceptible to PCP. Susceptibility was defined by a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count less than 200 cells/microliters or less than 20% of total circulating lymphocytes, or the occurrence of a previous episode of PCP. The goal of this approach was to reduce the frequency both of initial episodes of PCP (primary prophylaxis) and of relapses or recurrences (secondary prophylaxis). Either oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or aerosol pentamidine was recommended for prophylaxis, but because direct comparative data were lacking, neither regimen was endorsed as ""preferred."" Since the recommendations were issued in 1989, additional information has become available about the efficacy and safety of aerosol pentamidine and oral TMP-SMX. A trial sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases AIDS Clinical Trials Group compared these two regimens in a prospective randomized study; in August 1991, this study was terminated by an independent data and safety monitoring board because statistically significantly fewer recurrences of PCP were observed in the oral TMP-SMX group than in the aerosol pentamidine group (2). On the basis of this finding and other studies assessing PCP prophylaxis, the Task Force was reconvened on October 5, 1991. This report contains the revised recommendations issued by the Task Force."
19513,0.005,1.0000,"A new class of antiretroviral drugs is now available to the HIV provider: The CCR5 Antagonists belong to a group of entry inhibitors with a novel mechanism of action. While these antagonists do not directly interfere with any of the steps of HIV replication, they block the CCR5 receptor, one of the co-receptors HIV uses to enter its target cell. Thus CCR5 antagonists are able to prevent infection of the cell and represent a new and unique mechanism for the treatment of HIV. There is great interest in utilizing this new drug class in early treatment of HIV to prevent infection of large cell pools; CCR5 antagonists even may be useful tools in the various settings of exposure prophylaxis. Maraviroc is now approved in both the European Union and the United States for the treatment of HIV infection. This is the first medication belonging to the new class of CCR5 antagonists, and the first approval of an orally available drug in a new class since 1996. Aplaviroc, maraviroc, and vicriviroc are small molecule inhibitors of CCR5 that block HIV-1 infection in vitro and reduce plasma HIV-1 RNA in HIV infected subjects by approximately 1.5 log10 copies/mL over 10-14 days when given as single agents. Very limited data is available on the use of CCR5 antagonists in treatment naive patients due to early termination of many trials because of inferior performance or toxicity and at the time of this writing in August 2007 there is only one ongoing non-inferiority trial in the naive patient population. The 48 week interim results of this trial using twice daily maraviroc were reported at the International AIDS Society meeting in July 2007. Maraviroc compared to efavirenz was non-inferior in regards to percentage of subjects reaching viral loads below 400 copies/mL, but not so for the analysis of subjects reaching viral loads below 50 copies/mL. On the other hand maraviroc had a superior side-effect profile, fewer adverse events and a greater increase of CD4 cell count than efavirenz. These data will revitalize the interest in CCR5 antagonists as a treatment option for the treatment-naive patients. In order to be used as first line drugs, CCR5 antagonists face a number of challenges: They will have to be proven to be as potent, durable, safe, and convenient as current available options. Important questions unique to this new class will have to be answered: What are the mechanisms and risks of tropism change? What is the role and needed frequency of tropism testing, and what efficacy is seen in patients with dual-tropic/mixed infection in the long term? Clearly until we have answers to these questions CCR5 antagonists should be reserved for the treatment-experienced patient population with limited treatment options."
14716,0.005,1.0000,"As a result of shared routes of transmission, coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection is particularly high among persons who have used injection drugs; however, more recently, sexual transmission of HCV has been recognized among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM). Over the past decade, the effectiveness of HIV treatment improved substantially, leading to a substantial reduction in HIV/AIDS-related deaths; in this context, liver disease due to HCV infection has emerged as major concern for co-infected patients. Over the same period, treatment of HCV remained stagnant, with pegylated interferon alfa (PegIFN) plus ribavirin (RBV; PegIFN/RBV) entrenched as the standard treatment for HCV infection for co-infected patients, who have the greatest risk for liver disease. However, the effectiveness of HCV treatment in this population has been disappointing because of low rates of treatment initiation and success. In 2011, novel HCV NS3/4A PIs (PIs), telaprevir and boceprevir, were approved for use in combination with PegIFN/RBV for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection; at the time of approval, important questions regarding the efficacy, safety, and potential for drug interactions with telaprevir and boceprevir had not been answered. More recently, data from drug-interaction studies and 2 small, phase II clinical trials indicate that these HCV treatment regimens may lead to higher rates of HCV eradication in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, with manageable toxicity and pharmacologic interactions with antiretroviral drugs. As such, these HCV PI-based regimens have emerged as the standard for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection in carefully selected HIV-infected patients."

Hepatitis B (HBV) and HIV have similar routes of transmission primarily; sexual, intravenous injections and prenatal while hepatitis C (HCV) is transmitted mainly through blood transfusion. Human immunodeficiency virus increases the pathological effect of hepatitis viruses and potentiates re-activation of latent hepatitis infections as a result of reduced immunity.

13371,0.005,1.0000,"Persons at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are also likely to be at risk for other infectious pathogens, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). These are bloodborne pathogens transmitted through similar routes; for example, via injection drug use (IDU), sexual contact, or from mother to child during pregnancy or birth. In some settings, the prevalence of coinfection with HBV and/or HCV is high. In the context of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), liver disease has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected persons. Further, coinfection with viral hepatitis may complicate the delivery of ART by increasing the risk of drug-related hepatoxicity and impacting the selection of specific agents (e.g., those dually active against HIV and HBV). Expert guidelines developed in the United States and Europe recommend screening of all HIV-infected persons for infection with HCV and HBV and appropriate management of those found to be chronically infected. Treatment strategies for HBV infection include the use of nucleos(t)ide analogues with or without anti-HIV activity and/or peginterferon alfa (PegIFN) whereas HCV treatment is limited to the combination of PegIFN and ribavirin (RBV). Current approaches to management of HIV-infected persons coinfected with HBV or HCV are discussed in this review."

Its general aim is to contribute in the design of programmes to help people with HIV/AIDS (PWH/A) adopt and maintain safe sexual behaviours. A self-administered questionnaire on sexual and drug use behaviours was distributed to study participants. Between 1997 and 1999, 573 women with HIV infection naive to antiretroviral therapies completed the questionnaire (of whom 234 reported a history of injection drug use (IDU) and were enrolled in the study. Non-IDU women reported fewer sexual partners, both in their lifetime and in the preceding month, than IDU women: 19% of IDU and 4% of non-IDU women reported more than 25 lifetime sexual partners (p < 0.001). Interestingly, 83% of non-IDU women were infected by their regular partners: these women reported the lowest number of sexual partners. No difference emerged between IDU and non-IDU women in terms of number of sexual intercourse in the two weeks preceding the interview or in terms of condom use in the last intercourse (reported, overall, by 54% of these 573 women). Among women who had sex partners at the time of interview, more non-IDU (65%) than IDU (43%) women reported HIV-positive partners (p < 0.001). Overall, these findings stress a marked heterogeneity in the levels of past and recent sexual promiscuity according to history of drug use. It suggests the need to differentiate and individualize messages about self-protection and behaviours that may prevent further spread of HIV infection."

Although the incidence of HCV infection has declined markedly in the past 2 decades, chronic infection in 3 million or more residents now accounts for more disease and death in the United States than does human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS. Current trends in the epidemiology of HCV infection include an apparent increase in young, often suburban heroin injection drug users who initiate use with oral prescription opioid drugs; infections in nonhospital healthcare (clinic) settings; and sexual transmission among HIV-infected persons. Infectious disease physicians will increasingly have the responsibility of diagnosing and treating HCV patients. An understanding of how these patients were infected is important for determining whom to screen and treat."
11121,0.005,1.0000,"Two children who acquired hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection by mother-to-child transmission were monitored during interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. In Patient C1, CD4(+) T cell counts were within normal range and HIV-1 viral load was undetectable. HCV viral load declined slightly following treatment initiation while novel variants rapidly emerged, indicative of quasispecies diversification. In Patient C2, CD4(+) T cell counts were low and HIV-1 replication was not fully controlled by antiretroviral therapy. HCV viral load rose during treatment and a striking conservation of the variant spectrum was observed. In both cases, there was no decline in quasispecies complexity following treatment initiation and sustained virological response was not achieved. These results suggest that reduction in quasispecies complexity, which is observed in adult responders following interferon treatment, may be mechanistically unrelated with evolution of the variant profile and/or selective pressure exerted on HCV."
9025,0.005,1.0000,"Liver disease is a leading cause of death among patients with HIV coinfected with hepatitis C (HCV); yet, studies show that less than 10% receive HCV treatment, in part because of limited treatment response, high treatment toxicity, and psychosocial barriers to treatment readiness. Using a process model framework, we sought to explore the factors and processes by which providers make HCV treatment decisions for HIV-coinfected patients. We conducted 22 semistructured interviews with primary care providers and support staff at three HIV clinics in Los Angeles, California, in which rates of HCV treatment uptake varied from 10% to 38%. Providers agreed that stable HIV disease, favorable genotype, and significant signs of liver disease progression are all signs of need for treatment. However, two divergent treatment approaches emerged for genotype 1 and 4 patients with minimal disease, and in definitions of patient readiness. Providers with lower treatment rates preferred to delay treatment in hopes of better future treatment options, and were more conservative in requiring complete mental health screens and treatment and abstinence from substance use. Conversely, providers with higher treatment rates viewed all patients as needing treatment as soon as possible, and defined readiness more leniently, with some willing to treat even in the context of untreated depression and drug use, so long as ability to adhere well was demonstrated. Regardless of whether an aggressive or cautious approach to treatment is used, development of effective programs for promoting patient treatment readiness is critical to ensuring greater treatment uptake."

15474,0.005,1.0000,"Changes in glucose and fat metabolism associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have received attention because of the development of glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and lipodystrophy associated with protease inhibitor (PI) therapy. The response to ingested [13C]glucose (1.4 g/kg) was determined in 9 asymptomatic male HIV patients before and after 4.8 months of PI therapy (nelfinavir, 2,250 mg/d) compared with 9 matched seronegative HIV controls. No significant difference was observed for basal plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations between controls and patients before PI therapy. After 4.8 months of PI therapy, basal plasma glucose concentration was slightly, but significantly, increased (approximately 15%) compared with controls or HIV patients prior to receiving PI therapy. Over the first hour following ingestion of the glucose load, plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were higher in HIV patients than in controls, both before (approximately 15% and approximately 29%, respectively) and after (approximately 32% and approximately 43%, respectively) PI therapy. In addition, plasma C-peptide concentration was approximately 61% higher after PI therapy. The oxidation rate of fat, endogenous, and exogenous glucose was computed from the VO2 and respiratory exchange ratio corrected for protein oxidation and from 13C/12C in expired CO2. The only difference between controls and patients both before and after PI therapy was observed over the first 120 minutes following ingestion of the glucose load, when HIV patients oxidized approximately 18% more glucose and approximately 19% less fat than controls. This was not due to a larger oxidation rate of exogenous glucose, but to a larger oxidation rate of endogenous glucose (approximately 50%) in patients compared with controls. These data indicate that HIV infection is associated with minor changes in glucose metabolism, and that PI therapy with nelfinavir for 4.8 months only slightly further impairs glucose metabolism as assessed in response to a large oral glucose load. However, the larger stimulation of total and endogenous glucose oxidation and the larger reduction in fat oxidation, observed in the metabolic response to the glucose load in HIV patients, over time, could result in the accumulation of body fat and could contribute to lipodystrophy."
2807,0.005,1.0000,"There is an urgent need for valid, reliable, and simple-to-use screening tools for HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in South Africa, as little is known about its impact on South Africa's 5.5 million people living with HIV (PLWH). Screening for HAD in South Africa involves several challenges, including few culturally appropriate and validated screening tools, and a shortage of trained personnel to conduct screening. This study examined rates of positive HAD screens as determined by the cutoff score on the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) administered by nonspecialist community health workers (CHWs) in South Africa and examined associations between positive HAD screens and common risk factors for HAD. Sixty-five Xhosa-speaking HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with low CD4 counts and documented ART adherence problems were administered a battery of demographic, psychiatric and neurocognitive screening measures. Positive HAD screens were present in 80% of the sample. Presence of a current alcohol dependence disorder and CD4 counts of 200 or lower were significantly associated with positive HAD screens. HIV-positive South Africans on ART with low CD4 counts and ART adherence problems may be at a very high risk for HAD, highlighting the need for more routine screening and monitoring of neurocognitive functions among South Africa's millions of PLWH on ART. Future research is needed to: (1) validate IHDS performance against a gold standard neurocognitive battery for the detection of HAD among larger samples of Xhosa-speaking South Africans with ART adherence difficulties and (2) compare performance of CHW to expert health care personnel in administering the IHDS."

Functional imaging using F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography provided evidence of involvement of several cerebral regions which exhibited a distinct pattern of relative cerebral hypermetabolism (subcortical, brainstem, and cerebellar regions) and hypometabolism (sensorimotor cortex, mesiofrontal, and mesiotemporal areas) and functionally corresponded to the clinical symptoms.

HIV-infected participants with self-reported history of definite TBI were compared to HIV patients without TBI history. Groups were equated for relevant demographic and HIV-associated characteristics. The TBI group evidenced significantly greater deficits in executive functioning and working memory. N-acetylaspartate, a putative marker of neuronal integrity, was significantly lower in the frontal gray matter and basal ganglia brain regions of the TBI group. Together, these results suggest an additional brain impact of TBI over that from HIV alone. One clinical implication is that HIV patients with TBI history may need to be monitored more closely for increased risk of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder signs or symptoms."

Methamphetamine abuse in HIV-1 patients poses a potential risk for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, because methamphetamine and HIV-1 proteins such as transactivator of transcription can synergistically damage the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of methamphetamine and HIV-1 Tat protein on the blood-brain barrier function and to determine whether ginsenoside Rb1 (GsRb1) plays a role in protecting the BBB. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups. The experimental groups received methamphetamine and HIV-1 Tat protein or both and the control group received saline or GsRb1 pretreatment. Oxidative stress-related factors, tight junction (TJ) proteins, blood-brain barrier permeability, and morphological changes were recorded in each group. The results showed that the group treated with Methamphetamine[Formula: see text]Tat showed a significant change at the ultrastructural level and in the levels of oxidative stress-related factors, TJ proteins, and BBB permeability, suggesting that the BBB function was severely damaged by HIV-1 Tat and methamphetamine synergistically. However, malondialdehyde levels and BBB permeability were lower and the oxidative stress-related factors superoxide dismutase and glutathione were higher in the GsRb1-treated group than in the Methamphetamine[Formula: see text]Tat-treated group, indicating that GsRb1 can protect the BBB against the toxic effects of HIV-1 Tat and methamphetamine. These results show that GsRb1 may offer a potential therapeutic option for patients with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders or other neurodegenerative diseases."
14079,0.005,1.0000,"Therapeutic immunization to stimulate host immune responses and control human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) replication is being investigated as a supplementary treatment for the management of HIV infection. On completion of an earlier study involving three vaccinations while taking combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), twenty-five subjects with plasma viral load (pVL) <50 copies/mL received a booster vaccination with either placebo (n = 7); fowl pox vaccine (rFPV) expressing HIV-1 Gag/Pol; [partial construct- PC (n = 8)] or rFPV coexpressing HIV-1 Gag/Pol and human interferon gamma[full construct - FC (n = 10)]. One week after the booster vaccination, participants stopped ART and were monitored for safety, pVL and immunological parameters for < or =20 weeks. The time weighted mean change (SD) from baseline plasma HIV RNA was 1.80 (0.72), 1.78 (0.91) and 0.96 (0.91) log(10) copies/mL for placebo, PC and FC recipients respectively (p = 0.06; mean differences between placebo and FC). Laboratory evaluations did not reveal differences in anti-HIV specific immune responses between study arms. No difference between treatment arms for host genetic factors known to affect pVL was demonstrated. In conclusion, vaccination with FC was associated with a trend toward lower rates of HIV replication following cessation of ART relative to placebo or PC. The promising antiretrovirological effect supports further study of FC in a larger trial with a broader population of patients with HIV disease."
11729,0.005,1.0000,"Sestrin-2 is involved in p53-dependent antioxidant defenses and in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis. We hypothesize that sestrin-2 expression is altered in the brains of subjects diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) due to neuronal oxidative stress. We studied sestrin-2 immunoreactivity in 42 isocortex sections from HIV-1-infected subjects compared to 18 age-matched non-HIV controls and 19 advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases. With HIV infection, the sestrin-2 immunoreactivity pattern shifted from neuropil predominance (N) to neuropil and neuronal-soma co-dominance (NS) and neuronal-soma predominance (S; P < 0.0001, Chi-square test for linear trend). Among HIV cases showing the NS or S pattern, HAND cases were preferentially associated with the S pattern (n = 10 of 20) compared to cognitively intact cases (n = 1 of 11; P = 0.047, Fisher's exact test). In AD brains, sestrin-2 immunoreactivity was mostly intense in the neuropil and co-localized with phospho-Tau immunoreactivity in a subset of neurofibrillary lesions. Phospho-Tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary lesions were rare in HIV cases and their occurrence was not associated with HAND. Levels of isocortical 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (marker of nucleic acid oxidation) immunoreactivity were not significantly altered in HAND cases compared to cognitively intact HIV cases. In conclusion, the sestrin-2 immunoreactivity redistribution to neuronal soma in HAND suggests unique involvement of sestrin-2 in the pathophysiology of HAND, which is different from the role of sestrin-2 in AD pathogenesis. Alternatively, the difference in sestrin-2 immunoreactivity distribution between HAND and AD may be related to different degrees of severity or stages of oxidative stress."
13985,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis B virus (anti HBs or anti HBc) was 16.9 per cent in a group of anaesthetists, compared to 3.7 per cent in volunteer blood donors and 5.6 per cent of patients without hepatic infections. Professional risk factors such as treating a hepatitis B patient or working in a hospital laboratory, haemodialysis, an intensive care unit, or in oncology, did not correlate with antibody prevalence. Personal risk factors such as a history of a family member with hepatitis, or of receiving blood transfusion in the past were also not associated. A greater number of anaesthetists with a history of hepatitis in the past had antibodies, than those with no history (p less than 0.05). The country of origin may have been a contributing factor to antibody prevalence as highest positivity rates were found in subjects from Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe. One of 31 (3.2 per cent) seronegative subjects seroconverted over a four-year period. Results of testing in 1978 and 1982 revealed that 37 per cent of immune subjects possessed only anti HBc and at least one person positive for both markers on the first occasion was only anti HBc positive later. Laboratory testing, risk factors, and immunization for HBV should be examined in greater detail in larger populations of health care workers."
3795,0.005,1.0000,"Cannabis is increasingly prescribed clinically and utilized by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to address symptoms of HIV disease and to manage side effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART). In light of concerns about the possibly deleterious effect of psychoactive drug use on adherence to ART, we sought to determine the relationship between high-intensity cannabis use and adherence to ART among a community-recruited cohort of HIV-positive illicit drug users. We used data from the ACCESS study, an ongoing prospective cohort study of HIV-seropositive illicit drug users linked to comprehensive ART dispensation records in a setting of universal no-cost HIV care. We estimated the relationship between at least daily cannabis use in the last 6 months, measured longitudinally, and the likelihood of optimal adherence to ART during the same period, using a multivariate linear mixed-effects model accounting for relevant socio-demographic, behavioral, clinical and structural factors. From May 2005 to May 2012, 523 HIV-positive illicit drug users were recruited and contributed 2,430 interviews. At baseline, 121 (23.1 %) participants reported at least daily cannabis use. In bivariate and multivariate analyses we did not observe an association between using cannabis at least daily and optimal adherence to prescribed HAART (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 1.12, 95 % Confidence Interval [95 % CI]: 0.76-1.64, p value = 0.555.) High-intensity cannabis use was not associated with adherence to ART. These findings suggest cannabis may be utilized by PLWHA for medicinal and recreational purposes without compromising effective adherence to ART."
17844,0.005,1.0000,"The Perfil-es study demonstrated that, while non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based initial antiretroviral therapy (ART) is more frequently used in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected naïve patients, ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r)-based regimens are the preferred option in patients with advanced infectious stages or high baseline viral load. The present analysis focused on the second phase of the Perfil-es study, where sociodemographic and clinical data were retrospectively collected from patients starting NNRTI- or PI/r-based regimens in order to identify factors that could influence the choice of initial ART. Patients' characteristics were compared by both bivariate and multivariate analyses. A total of 642 patients were evaluated. The main transmission group was men who have sex with men (MSM) (48%), and 24% of patients were coinfected with hepatitis B or C. Patients with cardiovascular risk accounted for 56%, and 15% had a neuropsychiatric history. Anxiolytics (29%), antidepressants (18%) and methadone (18%) were the most frequent concomitant medications. The use of PI/r-based regimens was more frequent in older patients, childbearing potential women patients coinfected with hepatitis B or C, and those with cardiovascular risk and a neuropsychiatric history. The presence of a neuropsychiatric disorder (OR: 1.912; CI 95%: 1.146-3.191; p < .05) and the use of concomitant medication (OR: 1.736; CI 95%: 1.204-2.502; p < .01) were identified as independent factors associated with the selection of PI/r-based regimens. MSM sexual conduct was the only independent factor related to the selection of NNRTI-based ART (OR: 0.699; CI 95%: 0.504-0.970; p < .05). Neither the physicians' characteristics nor the geographical area where HIV patients were attended influenced the choice of ART. In conclusion, patients' comorbidity, pregnancy potential and lifestyle seem to influence the choice of ART. Neuropsychiatric comorbidity and concomitant medication, mainly related to this condition, appear to be associated with the use of PI/r-based initial ART while MSM seem more likely to receive NNRTI-based regimens in Spain."
5558,0.005,1.0000,"Cryptococcus neoformans is the most incriminated fungal pathogen causing meningitis in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, and is known to constitute a major cause of deaths in AIDS patients. This study aimed to determine the sero-prevalence and effect of CD4 count on seropositivity for Cryptococcus neoformans antigen (crag) in antiretroviral- naïve (ART-naïve) AIDS patients. This study included 150 (61 males and 89 females) ART-naïve AIDS patients attending the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) clinic of the University of Benin teaching hospital, Benin City, Nigeria within the period February 2011- July 2011. 40 (18 males and 22 females) HIV positive outpatients with CD4 counts >200 cells/µl who are ART-naive were recruited and used as controls. The prevalence of crag in the patients and control group was determined using the cryptococcal antigen latex agglutination system (CALAS) (Meridian Bioscience, Europe) and CD4 counts were measured using flow cytometry (Partec flow cytometer, Germany). Of 150 ART-naïve AIDS patients with CD4 counts ≤ 200 cells/µL, 19 (12.7%) were positive for serum Cryptococcal antigen. ART-naïve AIDS patients with CD4 count ≤50 cells/µl had the highest prevalence of serum crag. Lower CD4 counts were significantly associated with positivity for serum crag (P<0.001). Age and Sex had no significant effect on the sero-positivity for serum crag. 1 (2.5%) of the control was sero-positive for crag. Serum crag was significantly associated with AIDS but not with HIV (P<0.001). This study uncovers a high prevalence of crag in ART-naïve AIDS patients in Benin City. There is an urgent need to introduce early and routine screening for crag in ART-naïve AIDS patients for prompt intervention."
8104,0.005,1.0000,"Stavudine is no longer recommended for use in first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART), but it remains in high demand worldwide because it is affordable. We report the clinical presentation and incidence of severe hyperlactatemia (SL) in HIV-infected adults who initiated ART between April 2005 and May 2009 in Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa. In a prospective cohort study at the HIV care center affiliated with the National Centre for Blood Transfusion, we used standardized forms to record baseline and follow-up data. We measured serum lactate levels for all adults on ART who showed signs of hyperlactatemia. SL was defined as serum lactate >2.5 mmol/liter. Overall, 806 adults initiated ART. Among the 591 patients (73%) on stavudine-containing regimens, 394 were women (67%); the median pre-ART CD4 count was 150/mm3 and the median body mass index was 20.9 kg/m2. These patients were followed for a median of 28 months. We detected SL only among patients taking stavudine. The incidence of SL was 0.55/100 person-years (PY) (95% CI 0.47-0.63) overall and 0.85/100 PY among women (95% CI 0.75-0.95). Among the eight patients with SL, 100% lost >9% of body weight before diagnosis, 100% had serum lactate >4 mmol/liter (range 4.2-12.1), 50% had pre-ART BMI >25 kg/m2, and three patients died (38%), accounting for 6.4% of deaths among patients taking stavudine. As long as HIV clinicians continue to use stavudine in sub-Saharan Africa, they should watch out for acute unexplained weight loss in patients taking ART, particularly among women and patients with high pre-ART BMI."
5845,0.005,1.0000,"To characterize selection factors related to therapy initiation, the authors investigated the extent to which key markers of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease severity were associated with initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART). Logistic regression was used to determine the effects of CD4+ cell count and HIV RNA level on potent ART initiation during 6-month periods among 2,059 HIV-infected US women enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Low CD4+ counts and high HIV RNA levels were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with initiation of potent ART. During all periods between April 1996 and March 1998, CD4+ counts were more strongly associated with potent ART initiation than HIV RNA levels were; however, during the last period, both were associated (odds ratio per 100 CD4+-count decrease = 1.17, p < 0.01; odds ratio per 1 log10 increase in HIV RNA level = 1.48, p < 0.05). For a CD4+ count of 500 cells/ml and an HIV RNA level of 5,000 copies/ml, the probability of potent ART initiation increased from 0.5% to 16.8% between October 1995-March 1996 and October 1997-March 1998, suggesting earlier initiation of potent ART. Given the documented occurrence of confounding by indication, prospectively collected, time-dependent data on markers of disease progression and therapy use should be considered when making population-level comparisons before and after introduction of potent ART."
10856,0.005,1.0000,"The effect of long-term antiretroviral therapy on serum immune activation markers was assessed in a cohort of 63 patients before and after 6 years of boosted lopinavir-based antiretroviral therapy. High levels of most markers were associated with lower CD4(+) T cell counts at baseline and at year 6, with the exception of soluble cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (sCTLA-4); high levels of sCTLA-4 were associated with higher CD4(+) T cell counts at year 6. Abnormalities of serum immune activation markers persisted after 6 years of ART but probably had different causes. Further investigation of the clinical usefulness of assaying immunoglobulin A, neopterin, and sCTLA-4 levels to assess the effectiveness of treatments for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease are warranted."
1601,0.005,1.0000,"Drug-resistant isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) emerge during long-term treatment with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as zidovudine. The clinical significance of in vitro drug resistance to zidovudine has been difficult to determine. However, in a virologic analysis of baseline specimens from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 116B/117 study, high-level zidovudine resistance, defined as an IC50 of > or = 1 microM at study entry, was significantly associated with clinical disease progression. High-level zidovudine resistance also was an independent predictor of death as an end point, although this finding does not imply a direct causal effect. Duration and cumulative dose of prior zidovudine therapy did not predict clinical disease progression. More potent antiretroviral agents are needed that can be used in combination to achieve more complete virus suppression and to reduce the selection of drug-resistant HIV-1 mutants."
7327,0.005,1.0000,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine that regulates the proliferation and differentiation of lymphocytes, and is currently used clinically in the treatment of assorted malignancies. Additionally, IL-2 is being actively investigated in clinical trials for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Patients treated with IL-2 are susceptible to autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), presenting as thyroiditis, which leads to either thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism, if not correctly and promptly identified and treated. IL-2-induced hypothyroidism can also sometimes follow a thyrotoxic phase. However, the development of Graves' disease (GD) in this clinical setting has not been reported to date. Here, we report the case of a 39-year-old HIV-infected man in whom GD developed after IL-2 therapy. We correlated the immunologic parameters pertinent to the patient's HIV infection status with clinical, hormonal, and serologic evidence of GD during its emergence. This revealed an association between peripheral blood cell numbers of specific lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4(+), CD3(+)CD25(+), and naïve T-cells) and serum levels of markers for AITD (free thyroxine [T(4)] and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin). Interestingly, no association was found between natural killer (NK) cell numbers and AITD markers. The immunopathogenesis of GD in this patient may be similar to that hypothesized for the GD that occurs in immune-reconstituted patients after combination antiretroviral therapy. From a practical standpoint, we propose that patients who have received or are receiving treatment with IL-2 who show signs of hyperthyroidism need to be carefully evaluated for GD."
498,0.005,1.0000,"From December 1988 to April 1989, 154 female prostitutes in and around Ghent, Belgium, were interviewed about their knowledge, attitudes and practices in relation to the risks for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in their profession. Thirty four women worked as window prostitutes, 120 picked up their clients in bars, clubs, and saunas. Blood samples were taken from 123 women. One (0.8%) was seropositive for HIV1, 19 (15.4%) had Hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc), eight (6.4%) showed markers of syphilis. None of them were Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. Hepatitis C antibodies (anti-HCV) were present in the serum of three women (2.4%). Overall STD seroprevalence was higher in the group of window prostitutes than in the group of club prostitutes. One woman admitted intravenous drug use. Former testing for anti-HIV antibodies had been performed in 102 (66.5%) respondents, of whom 84 (82.3%) were tested in the year preceding the interview. In 74.5% of the cases, these tests were requested by the women themselves. These results suggest that HIV infection is not yet prevalent in non-intravenous drug using prostitutes in Ghent, but that this situation may change considering their higher rates of past STD. Window prostitutes are at higher risk than club prostitutes. Testing for HIV seems to be common practice, mostly at the request of the women themselves. Health education should discourage the notion of testing as an alternative to using condoms."
5733,0.005,1.0000,"1,182 males and 155 females attending an STD clinic from June 1984 to October 1985 were investigated for the presence of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 348 (29.5%) of the males and 5 (3.2%) of the females were antibody positive (ab+). 237 of the males were initially antibody negative (ab-) and were tested more than once, and during a 16-month period 40 of these seroconverted from ab- to antibody positive. The mean follow-up period of these 40 patients was 7.1 months, and thus the seroconversion rate is estimated to be 2.4% per month. Samples from 37 of these were available for HIV antigen testing. 19 of the patients were antigen positive in the latest ab- sample and accordingly, 18 patients were antigen negative in the latest ab- sample. No difference was found between the mean follow-up periods of those with and those without HIV antigen in the latest ab- serum and the presence of HIV antigen in serum was not associated with symptoms of acute HIV infection. After 20 months of follow-up, none (0.0-8.8%, 97.5% confidence limits) of the 40 patients have developed AIDS or AIDS-related complex."

In the present study, six out of 2137 infertility patients were seropositive for syphilis (0.28%) and four out of 791 were HIV positive (0.5%). All four women with HIV antibodies had negative tests for syphilis and none of them related any risk factor for HIV infection on their initial visit. The 0.5% sero-positivity rate found in our study warrants routine HIV testing in infertile patients."
17921,0.005,1.0000,"In order to identify novel proviral host factors involved in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, we performed a screen of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) library targeting 5,000 genes with the highest potential for being targets for therapeutics. Many siRNAs in the library against known host factors, such as TSG101, furin, and CXCR4, were identified as inhibitors by the screen and thus served as internal validation. In addition, many novel factors whose knockdown inhibited infection were identified, including Pak3, a member of the serine/threonine group I PAK kinases. The HIV accessory factor Nef has been shown to associate with a PAK kinase, leading to enhanced viral production; however, the exact identity of the kinase has remained controversial. Prompted by the Pak3 screen hit, we further investigated the involvement of group I PAK kinases in HIV using siRNA. Contrary to the current literature, Pak1 depletion strongly inhibited HIV infection in multiple cell systems and decreased levels of integrated provirus, while Pak2 depletion showed no effect. Overexpression of a constitutively active Pak1 mutant also enhanced HIV infection, further supporting its role as the dominant PAK involved."
2189,0.005,1.0000,"One hundred Chinese patients who received induction cytotoxic therapy for malignant lymphoma were prospectively studied to determine the incidence, morbidity, mortality, and predisposing factors for reactivation of hepatitis B virus replication during cytotoxic therapy. In 18 (67%) hepatitis B surface antigen-positive and 10 (14%) hepatitis B surface antigen-negative patients, hepatitis developed during cytotoxic therapy (P less than 0.0001). Hepatitis could be attributed to exacerbation or reactivation of chronic hepatitis B in 13 (72%) hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients but in only 2 (20%) hepatitis B surface antigen-negative patients (P less than 0.0001). Sudden increase or reactivation of hepatitis B virus replication gave rise to icteric hepatitis, nonfatal hepatic failure, and death in 22.3%, 3.7%, and 3.7% of patients who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen; in 2%, 2%, and 0% of those positive for hepatitis B antibodies; and in none of those who were seronegative. Among the hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients, male sex was the only factor that was associated with an increased risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus replication. We recommend that hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients with malignancies receiving cytotoxic therapy be closely monitored."

They were compared with a group of age- and sex-matched HIV-1-seronegative children consecutively selected from the outpatient department. Two subjects were asymptomatic. Chronic cough was the most frequent symptom (seven of 16 patients). The most common signs were short stature (12 of 16 patients), low weight for age (seven of 16 patients), chronic parotitis (eight of 16 patients), persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (seven of 16 patients), and pulmonary tuberculosis (four of 16 patients). Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis was diagnosed on radiologic grounds in five of 16 patients. Evidence of perivasculitis in the fundus was noted in three of 16 patients. Two children died during the study period (mean duration of follow-up, 40 months; range, 27 to 62 months); none of the other children had life-threatening infection or loss of developmental milestones. Immunologic assessment in the 16 children revealed high levels of IgG, decreased CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and skin test anergy. Endocrinologic investigations revealed normal thyroid function and normal basal human growth hormone levels but low basal insulinlike growth factor I levels (0.21 +/- 0.07 vs 0.44 +/- 0.20 U/mL for controls). In Kigali, perinatally HIV-1-infected children surviving beyond 5 years of age often present with moderate signs and symptoms, principally pulmonary involvement, chronic parotitis, and persistent generalized lymphadenopathy. Short stature is the major clinical manifestation in these patients and may be due, in part, to low growth hormone secretion rather than to malnutrition."

Anti-HD was detected in three of the 29 children with acute hepatitis B and in only one of the 68 with chronic hepatitis B; none of the serum specimens from 150 asymptomatic carriers with normal liver function profile showed detectable anti-HD. All three children with HDV coinfection cleared HBsAg and seroconverted to anti-HBs, whereas one with superinfection finally had normal liver function without clearance of HBsAg. To identify possible sources of HDV infection, HBV markers and anti-HD in family members were also examined. One 4-month-old infant boy became infected through a blood transfusion from his hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive carrier father, who had anti-HD. A 4-month-old infant girl was infected through close contact with her HBeAg-negative carrier father, who had HDV superinfection. The infection sources remained undefined in another two patients. The mothers of these four children were seronegative for anti-HD, indicating that perinatal transmission is not the usual mode of HDV infection in Taiwan. The natural course of either acute or chronic HBV infections in childhood in Taiwan may be more closely related to HBV itself, or to some other yet unrecognized factor, rather than to HDV infection."

Therefore, in clinical practice the monitoring of antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis B in women of reproductive age is becoming especially important. The safety of lamivudine use in pregnant women infected with hepatitis B virus has not yet been proven. In this case, the patient became pregnant during the treatment with lamivudine and when hepatitis B virus replication markers were present in the serum (hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis Be antigen, hepatitis B virus DNA). Treatment with lamivudine lasted through the first 6 weeks of pregnancy, which was complicated by a possibility of intrauterine hepatitis B virus infection, did not cause any fetus injury."

Of the 338 PCVs who served in Zaire between October 1985 and May 1988, 282 (83%) were enrolled, representing 7776 volunteer-months of service. Analyses of serum samples for HIV and hepatitis B virus were performed on enrollment and at completion of service. All PCVs received extensive education and counseling regarding HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome throughout their stay in Zaire. There were no documented seroconversions to HIV among 282 PCVs who lived in Zaire for periods ranging from 1 to 81 months, with a mean length of stay of 27.4 months. Of the 14 (6.2%) of 226 PCVs tested who had at least one positive serologic marker for infection with hepatitis B virus, none was documented to have seroconverted during service. During the study period, the rate of all sexually transmitted diseases among PCVs in Africa decreased from 131 to 68 per 1000 study population per year, and there were 52 cases of confirmed malaria among volunteers in Zaire. These data suggest that the risk of acquiring infection with HIV or hepatitis B virus in PCVs in Zaire is very low, and there is no evidence for unusual modes of transmission."

A prospective study of heterosexual men and women selected on having multiple partners and presenting to an STD clinic as new patients was carried out from October 1987 through December 1989. Follow-up continued until December 1990 at the STD clinic of the Municipal Health Service of Amsterdam. Five hundred ninety-eight men and women entered the study. More than 70% of both women and men had had commercial sexual partners in the last 5 years. Three hundred eighty-one participants were born in HBV low endemic countries, 205 came from HBV intermediate endemicity regions. The prevalence of HBV markers in both men and women from low endemic regions was 10%, and for men and women from middle endemic regions 42% and 19%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that number of years involved in commercial sex was an independent risk factor in male participants from HBV low endemic regions (odds ratio [OR] 1.10 per year) and for women sexual contact with men at high risk of HBV infection (OR 2.59).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

This report documents the incidence rates of MHD among HIV-positive members of all service branches and compares the rates to those of two HIV-unexposed control groups: an HSV2-infected group and a group without documented HIV or HSV2 infections. Approximately 56 percent of HIV-infected service members received an incident diagnosis of a MHD six months or more after the initial detection of their infections. Cumulative incidence rates in nearly all MHD categories of interest were highest in the HIV group, intermediate in the HSV2 group and lowest in the referent group. The disorders more frequently diagnosed among HIV-infected service members compared to their uninfected counterparts were psychosis/schizophrenia, substance dependence, substance abuse, bipolar disorder, suicide ideation and depression. The findings are consistent with previous studies and reiterate the importance of long-term and comprehensive clinical monitoring of individuals diagnosed with HIV-1 infections."

The prevalence of antibodies to HIV 1 and HIV 2 was studied by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) among various groups of subjects in The Gambia, west Africa--namely, prostitutes, blood donors, patients with suspected infection with HIV, patients attending clinics for sexually transmitted diseases, and patients with tuberculosis. Four cases of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) due to infection with HIV 1 were detected, of which three had been acquired abroad. No other subject was found to be positive for antibodies to HIV 1. The prevalence of antibodies to HIV 2 among the patients attending clinics for sexually transmitted diseases was found to have increased from 0/117 in 1984 to 10/185 (5%) in the last six months of 1986. One out of 278 blood donors was positive for antibodies to HIV 2 as were 10 out of 80 patients with suspected AIDS. HIV 2 seems to be transmitted sexually, and, although it has been present for only a short time, it seems to be endemic in The Gambia and is pathogenic."
3011,0.005,1.0000,"Over a four-year period 40 patients of local origin, with primary hepatocellular carcinoma were seen at a regional referral centre. Twenty-nine patients had histological evidence of underlying cirrhosis and these patients were predominantly male (25/29) and elderly (mean age 66 years). Serological evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was found in 11 (38 per cent) of the cirrhotic group. Of the 25 males with cirrhosis, 13 (52 per cent) were known to have seen military service in the tropics and of these eight had serum HBV markers. The non-cirrhotic group was younger (mean age 55 years) and the sex distribution was nearly equal (six male, five female). Two patients (19 per cent) had hepatitis B markers including one of the two men in this group who had served in the tropics. One patient with no serum HBV markers had integrated HBV-DNA sequences in the cellular DNA of her tumour. These observations confirm the association of primary hepatocellular carcinoma with hepatitis B virus and suggest that a significant proportion of patients of United Kingdom origin acquired their susceptibility as a result of military service in the tropics. There is presumably a substantial cohort of ex-service men at risk of developing primary hepatocellular carcinoma."

Long Memorial Hospital were reviewed. Of 79 patients with AIDS or ARC diagnosed since 1982, 14 required major abdominal surgery. Operations performed were for gastrointestinal (GI) complications of opportunistic infections and neoplasms (four), diagnosis of major retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (four), and treatment of AIDS-related immune thrombocytopenia (six). GI complications consisted of two cases of cytomegalovirus perforation of ileum and colon, one case of bleeding ileocolonic lymphoma, and one case of cryptosporidium cholecystitis. Laparotomy for diagnosis of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy was performed in four patients and provided diagnostic material in three of them. Six patients underwent splenectomy for AIDS-related immune thrombocytopenia. Four of these patients had previously been treated with prednisone without impressive results. All patients had marked improvement of their platelet counts and clinical bleeding after splenectomy. Postoperative complications were common and consisted of wound infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, GI bleeding, pneumocystis pneumonia, small-bowel obstruction, and cytomegalovirus pneumonia. One patient died after laparotomy for perforated ulcers of the ileum and colon."
8620,0.005,1.0000,"Due to the shared routes of transmission, co-infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is common. There is strong evidence of bidirectional interactions between HIV and ulcerative STIs. Recent studies have also shown importance of non-ulcerative inflammatory STIs in the acquisition of HIV. The incidence of HIV and Chlamydia in Georgia has risen every year. We explored the extent of the problem of co-infection with C. trachomatis in HIV patients in the country. Study included 234 consecutive patients diagnosed with HIV from September 2008 through May 2009. Of them, approximately two-thirds were male 162 (69.23%), up to 44% (102) of patients had more than one lifetime sexual partner and one fifth of patients reported prior history of STIs. The seroprevalence of C. trachomatis in our study was 23.93% (95% CI: 18.61%-29.92%). In multivariate analysis the strongest predictors of C. trachomatis infection were history of STI (PR 1.94, 95% CI: 1.22-3.07) and female gender (PR 1.79, 95% CI: 1.11-2.87), while younger age and not being in marriage showed borderline significance. Findings of our study have important public health and clinical implications. Data suggest that STIs may play important role in increasing heterosexual transmission of HIV in Georgia. Efforts should be made to expand HIV screening programs. Further research is needed to better understand the role of inflammatory STIs in spreading HIV."
7403,0.005,1.0000,"Using nucleotide sequences from the first exon of the tat gene of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), we tested the hypothesis that a Florida dentist (a common source) infected five of his patients in the course of dental procedures against the null hypothesis that the dentist and each individual of the dental group independently acquired the virus within the local community. This novel approach of analyzing the tat gene region was used because it may, in some circumstances, be more informative for phylogenetic epidemiology than the more commonly used C2-V3 envelope gene region. The first exon of the tat gene was polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified and directly sequenced from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Patient's sequences were compared with sequences from six HIV-1 infected heterosexual couples unrelated to the dentist or the five patients, but from the same general geographic area. In addition, a sixth infected dental patient, previously inferred to have acquired HIV-1 from a source other than the dentist, was included. Multiple phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the sequences of the five patients were significantly more closely related to each other than to sequences of the controls. Our results using tat sequences, combined with envelope sequence data, strongly support a common phylogenetic epidemiological relationship among these five patients, and the HIV-1 infected dentist who treated them. Correct recovery of known epidemiological relationships among couples included in the analysis further strengthens this conclusion."
14615,0.005,1.0000,The role of viral factors in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still inconclusive. Whether virological features such as viral load or mutants might change with the progression of HCC remains unknown. A case-control study including patients with early HCC and HBsAg carriers who are presumed to be at the minimal potential of HCC as controls might better identify factors significantly associated with HCC development.

Data were available for 155 (99%) patients. Statistical analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Median follow-up was 28 months and 30 months for control and IL-2 patients, respectively. Twenty-five (16%) patients developed AIDS or died during follow-up (16 control patients vs. 9 IL-2 patients; R2=0.57; P=.22). Mean change from baseline CD4 cell count was significantly higher in patients randomized to receive IL-2 (368 vs. 153 cells/microL; P=.003). Mean change from baseline plasma HIV RNA was significantly lower in patients randomized to receive IL-2 (-0.98 vs. -0.63 log copies/mL; P=.004). Significant improvements in CD4 cell count and plasma HIV RNA in recipients of IL-2 relative to control patients were associated with a nonsignificant trend toward improved clinical outcome."
12365,0.005,1.0000,"Although skewing of the CD4+ TCR repertoire in advanced HIV infection is well documented, increases in polyclonality during antiretroviral therapy have been less consistently observed. Ten patients, each with documented abnormalities within the CD4+ TCR repertoire, were studied by CDR3 spectratyping, semiquantitative PCR, and SSCP during 9-26 months of therapy. Naive and memory cell phenotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Six of 10 patients showed increased polyclonality of their TCR repertoires, 1 showed no change, and 3 showed increased TCR skewing, despite suppressed viral replication. Overall, there was no significant change in the percentage of abnormal BV subfamilies (from a mean of 25.5 to 17.1%) or the percentage of naive CD4+ T cells (from a mean of 18 to 25%). Further, progression of TCR repertoire disruptions was observed in some patients even with suppression of plasma viral RNA below 500 copies/ml. Although a spectrum of changes may be seen within the CD4+ TCR repertoire in the setting of antiretroviral therapy, increases in polyclonality are observed in some patients."
19475,0.005,1.0000,"The chemokine receptor CCR5 has been shown to be a major coreceptor for HIV-1. The chemokines that bind to this receptor (MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES) are potent inhibitors of HIV replication and may play an important role in the pathophysiology of HIV disease. We investigated the effect of potent antiretroviral therapy (ritonavir and saquinavir) on the production of MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES in 19 HIV-infected patients who had sustained decreases in plasma HIV RNA levels (<200 copies/ml). Chemokine concentrations were measured in serum, plasma, and PHA-stimulated PBMCs at baseline and 24 and 48 weeks after initiating therapy. MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES levels in serum and plasma did not significantly change in the 48-week period. In contrast, MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta secreted by PHA-stimulated PBMCs increased at 24 weeks, with this increase sustained at 48 weeks, whereas no significant change was observed in PHA-induced RANTES production. A significant positive correlation was found between the changes in PHA-induced chemokine production and baseline CD4+ T cell counts. These data demonstrate that sustained suppression of viral replication by potent antiretroviral therapy has a potentially beneficial effect on chemokine production and early initiation of this therapy appears to confer a more favorable chemokine profile."
13214,0.005,1.0000,"The rate of development of disease varies considerably among human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected children. The reasons for these observed differences are not clearly understood but most probably depend on the dynamic interplay between the HIV-1 quasispecies virus population and the immune constraints imposed by the host. To study the relationship between disease progression and genetic diversity, we analyzed the evolution of viral sequences within six perinatally infected children by examining proviral sequences spanning the C2 through V5 regions of the viral envelope gene by PCR of blood samples obtained at sequential visits. PCR product DNAs from four sample time points per child were cloned, and 10 to 13 clones from each sample were sequenced. Greater genetic distances relative to the time of infection were found for children with low virion-associated RNA burdens and slow progression to disease relative to those found for children with high virion-associated RNA burdens and rapid progression to disease. The greater branch lengths observed in the phylogenetic reconstructions correlated with a higher accumulation rate of nonsynonymous base substitutions per potential nonsynonymous site, consistent with positive selection for change rather than a difference in replication kinetics. Viral sequences from children with slow progression to disease also showed a tendency to form clusters that associated with different sampling times. These progressive shifts in the viral population were not found in viral sequences from children with rapid progression to disease. Therefore, despite the HIV-1 quasispecies being a diverse, rapidly evolving, and competing population of genetic variants, different rates of genetic evolution could be found under different selective constraints. These data suggest that the evolutionary dynamics exhibited by the HIV-1 quasispecies virus populations are compatible with a Darwinian system evolving under the constraints of natural selection."
5035,0.005,1.0000,"Long-term nonprogressive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and its transition to progressive infection presents an opportunity to identify the molecular determinants of HIV-1 attenuation and pathogenesis. We studied an individual who underwent a transition from long-term nonprogressive to rapidly progressive infection. Because HIV-1 RNA genomes in plasma represent replicating virus, we developed a technique to clone full-length HIV-1 RNA genomes from plasma and used this technique to obtain clones from this individual before and during the transition. Most clones assayed were infectious, demonstrating that the RNA genomes encoded viable virus. Analysis of 20 complete HIV-1 RNA genomic sequences revealed one major difference between sequences found during the two phases of infection. During the nonprogressive phase, the predominant sequences had a large deletion in an Sp1-binding site and adjacent promoter in the U3 part of the long terminal repeat (LTR); when the infection became progressive, all viruses had intact Sp1 and promoter sequences and were derived from a minor species present earlier. Analysis of 184 clones of the LTR region obtained at five time points spanning a 7-year period confirmed this switch. In an in vitro assay, the deletion downregulated LTR-driven transcription of a reporter gene. In addition, analysis of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes predicted from the complete viral RNA genomes revealed multiple potential escape mutants that accumulated by the time of progression. These studies suggest that during the nonprogressive phase, the Sp1 enhancer-promoter deletion is likely to have played a role in decreasing replication, thereby attenuating HIV-1. The accumulation of CTL escape mutants suggests that a breakdown in immunologic surveillance may have allowed proliferation of intact virus, thus leading to rapid disease progression. These data reveal the viral and immune interactions characterizing a transition from long-term nonprogressive to rapidly progressive infection."
14486,0.005,1.0000,"Summary - In the last few years, the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy has radically modified the prognosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Osteonecrosis and osteoporosis are among the bone complications recently described in HIV-infected patients. We report a preliminary study comparing 47 HIV-infected patients (31 men and 16 women) to 47 age- and sex-matched controls. Bone mineral density was lower in patients than in controls: in men, 0.919 +/- 0.120 g/cm2 vs. 1.010 +/- 0.139 g/cm2 (P = 0.01) at the total hip and 0.948 +/- 0.100 g/cm2 vs. 1.043 +/- 0.117 g/cm2 (P = 0.0008) at the lumbar spine; in women, 0.912 +/- 0.149 g/cm2 vs. 0.968 +/- 0.090 g/cm2 at the total hip (P = 0.17) and 0.989 +/- 0.152 g/cm2 vs. 1.080 +/- 0.097 g/cm2 (P = 0.01) at the lumbar spine. HIV-infected males were more likely to have osteopenia and osteoporosis, as compared to the male controls (19 vs. 14 and 4 vs. 1, respectively, P = 0.02). None of the women had osteoporosis; nine HIV-infected women and one female control had osteopenia (P = 0.003). No fractures were recorded. In this preliminary study, no evidence supporting a relationship between bone loss and protease inhibitor treatment was found."
861,0.005,1.0000,"Screening hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV core antibody (anti-HBc) is recommended prior to cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy. This case describes an anti-HBc negative, DNA positive occult HBV infection in a 71-year-old Caucasian male following rituximab-based treatment for follicular lymphoma. Pre-screening serology indicated negative HBsAg and anti-HBc. However, following sequential treatment cycles the patient developed weak HBsAg with a low HBV DNA load (<1,000 IU/ml), but remained anti-HBc negative. The DNA load peaked 5 months later (>1 × 10(6)  IU/ml) and he was subsequently treated with Tenofovir. Currently the patient remains anti-HBc negative, and is anti-HBe negative, anti-HBs negative, HBeAg positive. No clinical or biochemical evidence of hepatitis has occurred. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis identified the HBV genosubtype as D4, most probably acquired some years ago during a stay in Papua New Guinea, in spite of prior hepatitis B vaccination. Four amino acid substitutions were detected within the HBsAg loop yet none in the core protein. This case questions the dependability of anti-HBc testing and highlights the role of HBV DNA testing prior to and throughout cytotoxic or immunosuppressive regimes. As this case exemplifies, vaccination protects against clinical infection but may not exclude seronegative occult infection with the possibility of reactivation."

A case of spontaneous supracondylar femoral fracture that occurred in a 58-year-old monk during meditation is reported. His AIDS disease was controlled with combination antiretroviral therapy. Vitamin D and calcium had been added 3yr before since osteoporosis was detected by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). At the time of the fracture, the patient was on treatment with 35mg every week of sodium risedronate, 1000mg of calcium, and 400IU of Vitamin D every day. Clinical use of DXA for HIV patients should be considered as a routine measure to help reducing risk for fractures."
9645,0.005,1.0000,"This article describes the occurrence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in a 39-year-old human immunodeficiency virus-positive patient. The patient sought medical care complaining of increased volume in the right mandibular angle and imaging tests showed an extensive radiolucency with undefined boundaries compromising the mandibular border. After the incisional biopsy, the patient had a pathological fracture in the region, which was properly treated in a second surgical procedure using a 2.4-mm reconstruction plate. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive marking for CD3, CD79a, Ki67, and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA. The treatment consisted of concurrent antiretroviral therapy with chemotherapy with rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. Examinations of images (2 years postoperatively) revealed complete bone repair and absence of injury recurrence. This work is important because it describes an unusual location of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and shows the importance of diagnosis and treatment of the injury at an early stage in order to promote the prognosis and survival of patients."
1930,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment engagement, retention and adherence to care are required for optimal HIV outcomes. Yet, patients may fall below the treatment recommendations for achieving undetectable viral load or not be retained in care. This study examined the most challenging patients in Buenos Aires, Argentina, those non-adherent to HIV care. Men (n = 61) and women (n = 59) prescribed antiretrovirals (ARVs) and non-adherent to treatment in the prior 3-6 months were enrolled and assessed regarding adherence, knowledge, motivation and attitudes regarding treatment. Private clinic patients had lower viral load and higher self-reported adherence than public clinic patients. Motivations to be adherent and positive beliefs regarding ARVs were associated with increased adherence in public clinic participants. Increased self-efficacy was associated with increased adherence among participants from both clinics. Results support patient and provider interventions that strengthen the characteristics supporting adherence, engagement and retention in public and private clinic settings. "

Antiretroviral treatment led to normalization of liver biochemistry, supporting the hypothesis of HIV induced autoimmune hepatitis."
1442,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment interruptions (TIs) limit the therapeutic success of combination antiretroviral therapy and are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. HIV-positive individuals dealing with concurrent health issues, access challenges and competing life demands are hypothesized to be more likely to interrupt treatment. Individuals were included if they initiated cART ≥1 year prior to interview date and had a CD4 cell count and initial regimen recorded at initiation. Using pharmacy recording, a TI was defined as a patient-initiated gap in treatment ≥90 consecutive days during the 12 months preceding or following the study interview. 117 (15.2 %) of 768 participants included in this study had a TI during the study window. 76.0 % of participants were male, 27.5 % were of Aboriginal ancestry and the median age was 46 (interquartile range 40-52). In multivariable logistic regression, TIs were significantly associated with current illicit drug use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.68, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.05-2.68); <95 % adherence in the first year of treatment (aOR 2.68, 95 % CI 1.67-4.12); living with at least one person (aOR 1.95; 95 % CI 1.22-3.14) or living on the street (aOR 5.08, 95 % CI 1.72-14.99) compared to living alone; poor perception of overall health (aOR 1.64 95 % CI 1.05-2.55); being unemployed (aOR: 2.22, 95 % CI 1.16-4.23); and younger age at interview (aOR 0.57, 95 % CI 0.44-0.75, per 10 year increase). Addressing socioeconomic barriers to treatment retention is vital for supporting the continuous engagement of patients in care. "
1111,0.005,1.0000,"There are conflicting data regarding the influence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection on the immune restoration experienced by HIV-infected patients who receive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In this multicenter, retrospective, longitudinal study, CD4 restoration was assessed according to HCV status in treatment-naive HIV-infected patients within 3 years of HAART. Only patients with persistent HIV suppression were included. Factors predicting CD4 gains were analyzed with multivariate linear regression. Out of 322 patients included 139 had positive HCV-RNA and 183 were only HIV infected. HCV-HIV-coinfected patients were older, more often ex-intravenous drug users (IVDU), and had less advanced HIV infection. Baseline CD4 count [OR -0.21 [95% CI (-0.34)-(-0.04)]; p = 0.01] and male sex [OR -0.19 [95% CI (-191.12)-(-10.87)]; p = 0.03] predicted smaller increments in absolute CD4 counts, and higher baseline CD4% [OR -0.38 [95% CI (-0.39)-(-0.21)]; p < 0.0001] and older age [OR -0.12 [95% CI (-0.23)-(-0.01)]; p = 0.03] predicted smaller gains in CD4% after 3 years of HAART. A history of IVDU was associated with smaller absolute CD4 count increases at 1 year of therapy [OR -0.20 [95% CI (-128.32)-(-16.24)]; p = 0.01]. Use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-only regimens and of zidovudine as part of the NRTI backbone was associated with smaller and greater gains in CD4%, respectively. HCV replication per se does not impair the CD4 restoration in HIV-infected patients successfully treated with antiretroviral therapy. Lower baseline CD4 counts are the strongest predictors of greater CD4 gains over a 3-year period, while a history of IVDU negatively affects CD4 restoration only early after the initiation of HAART."
5514,0.005,1.0000,"Neutralization-escape variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were sought in persons who had persistent low virus loads and who remained asymptomatic for at least 12-16 years of infection without antiretroviral therapy. Viruses were isolated from 3 persons at two or three time points during the course of infection and were assessed for neutralization by sequential autologous serum samples. Virus neutralization was poor or undetectable with contemporaneous autologous serum but improved with later serum samples for each person. In particular, later isolates resisted neutralization by autologous serum samples that neutralized an earlier isolate. Strain-specific neutralizing antibodies remained detectable for up to 4.2 years without diminishing in titer. The results demonstrate that neutralization-escape variants arise periodically in HIV-1-infected long-term nonprogressors."
6068,0.005,1.0000,"Recent studies have demonstrated that, in common with other latent viruses, parvovirus B19 infection can be controlled by the host immune response but may persist in some places such as the bone marrow. Persistent B19 infection has been found in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals, such as patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, there is limited data regarding long-term B19 viremia in HIV patients. In this study, we investigated virological and hematological findings, and also the clinical outcome, of seven cases of HIV/B19 coinfection (confirmed by PCR) after one year. These cases were provided from a previous study on patients with HIV infection that found B19 DNA in 13 cases. Seven of these 13 patients were available after 1 year, and we retested them for B19 viremia and B19-specific antibodies. B19 IgG was tested by ELISA, and B19 DNA was assessed by nested PCR. Anemia was not observed in these cases. All subjects had cleared viremia, but B19 IgG seroconversion occurred in two cases. No significant changes in CD4 and hemoglobin occurred. The results of this study indicate that B19 infection in HIV patients is a subtle infection and that B19 viremia is not a long-term event. "
18261,0.005,1.0000,"The increasing prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C infection worldwide calls for efforts to develop a relevant animal model for evaluating strategies against the transmission of the virus. A chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), SHIV(CHN19), was generated with a primary, non-syncytium-inducing HIV-1 subtype C envelope from a Chinese strain in the background of SHIV(33). Unlike R5-tropic SHIV(162), SHIV(CHN19) was not found to replicate in rhesus CD4(+) T lymphocytes. SHIV(CHN19) does, however, replicate in CD4(+) T lymphocytes of pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina). The observed replication competence of SHIV(CHN19) requires the full tat/rev genes and partial gp41 region derived from SHIV(33). To evaluate in vivo infectivity, SHIV(CHN19) was intravenously inoculated, at first, into two pig-tailed and two rhesus macaques. Although all four animals became infected, the virus replicated preferentially in pig-tailed macaques with an earlier plasma viral peak and a faster seroconversion. To determine whether in vivo adaptation would enhance the infectivity of SHIV(CHN19), passages were carried out serially in three groups of two pig-tailed macaques each, via intravenous blood-bone marrow transfusion. The passages greatly enhanced the infectivity of the virus as shown by the increasingly elevated viral loads during acute infection in animals with each passage. Moreover, the doubling time of plasma virus during acute infection became much shorter in passage 4 (P4) animals (0.2 day) in comparison to P1 animals (1 to 2 days). P2 to P4 animals all became seropositive around 2 to 3 weeks postinoculation and had a decline in CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio during the early phase of infection. In P4 animals, a profound depletion of CD4 T cells in the lamina propria of the jejunum was observed. Persistent plasma viremia has been found in most of the infected animals with sustained viral loads ranging from 10(3) to 10(5) per ml up to 6 months postinfection. Serial passages did not change the viral phenotype as confirmed by the persistence of the R5 tropism of SHIV(CHN19) isolated from P4 animals. In addition, the infectivity of SHIV(CHN19) in rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also increased after in vivo passages. Our data indicate that SHIV(CHN19) has adapted well to grow in macaque cells. This established R5-tropic SHIV(CHN19)/macaque model would be very useful for HIV-1 subtype C vaccine and pathogenesis studies."
11394,0.005,1.0000,"Thalidomide is emerging as a useful agent in the management of several complications of disease due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We conducted three prospective studies of 56 HIV-infected patients who were treated with thalidomide for 14-21 days; 24 (43%) of these patients discontinued therapy owing to adverse reactions. Cutaneous and/or febrile reactions were the most frequent toxicities, arising in 20 (36%) of the patients. These reactions occurred after a mean interval (+/-SD) of 10 +/- 3 days and were associated with significantly lower CD4 T lymphocyte counts in reactors than in nonreactors (median count, 52.5/mm3 vs. 242 cells/mm3, respectively; P = .009). Four of four rechallenged patients experienced accelerated hypersensitivity; hypotension occurred in one case. Although sedation was an almost universal side effect among the patients, it was moderate or severe in only seven (13%); constipation was moderate or severe in five (9%) of the patients. Severe neuropathic symptoms and mood changes were each noted in two (4%) of the 56 patients. We conclude that the increasing use of thalidomide to treat HIV-infected patients must be accompanied by recognition of the drug's increased potential for toxicity in this population."
7149,0.005,1.0000,"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is a frequent complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but involvement of the sinonasal region has only rarely been reported. We report three cases of AIDS-associated sinonasal NHL that occurred at our institution and review eight cases that were reported in the literature. The epidemiological and clinicopathologic features of these cases are described and compared with those of three other groups of patients: non-HIV-infected patients with sinonasal NHL, HIV-infected patients with NHL of any anatomic site, and HIV-infected patients with infectious sinusitis. Patients with AIDS-associated sinonasal NHL more frequently developed bony erosion and presented with signs and symptoms referable to adjacent structures, such as the orbit, than did HIV-infected patients with sinusitis, and patients with AIDS and NHL less frequently had typical sinus symptoms and diffuse sinus involvement than did patients with sinusitis. However, the clinical manifestations of these conditions overlap; thus a high index of suspicion for NHL is imperative for prompt diagnosis. These lymphomas typically are high-grade and disseminate early, and the prognosis is generally poor."

We describe a strong interaction between nelfinavir and tacrolimus postoperatively, that caused a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus by a factor 70 compared with normal, to achieve therapeutic blood concentrations and to avoid toxic side effects. We suggest that nelfinavir inhibits the metabolism of tacrolimus because both compounds are well-known substrates for the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP 3A4. The nelfinavir serum concentrations were not affected by the institution of tacrolimus. Although the interaction dramatically changed the tacrolimus dose-concentration relationship, the situation was manageable by frequent monitoring of blood concentrations of tacrolimus."
6213,0.005,1.0000,"Linkage and retention in care soon after HIV diagnosis improves clinical outcomes. Conversely, missed visits after diagnosis are associated with increased mortality in the public care setting. We analyzed mortality among newly diagnosed HIV patients ≥18 years old in a large private care setting between 01/01/1997 and 12/31/2009, comparing patients who missed visits in their first year following diagnosis (index period) with those who did not. Patients who died during the index period were excluded. Hazard ratios (HR) for association of missed visits and mortality were obtained by Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for patient demographics, CD4+ counts, and AIDS-defining conditions (CDC, 1993) at diagnosis. We also evaluated risk factors of missed visits by multivariable logistic regression. 2811 patients were included, of whom 65% had ≥1 missed visit, and 226 patients died during follow-up. Patients with ≥1 missed visit had a 71% increased mortality risk (HR=1.71, p=0.001) with 12% increased rate per missed visit (HR=1.12, p<0.001). Factors associated with missed visits were younger age (OR=1.69 compared to 60+ years), Black and Latino race/ethnicity (OR=1.54, 1.48 respectively, compared to Caucasians), injection drug use (OR=2.50 compared to men who have sex with men), and lower CD4+ (OR=1.43 for CD4+ 100-199 cells/μL, OR=1.39 for 50-99 cells/μL, and OR=1.63 for CD4+ <50 cells/μL, compared with CD4+ >500 cells/μL). In an insured patient population, missed visits in the first year of HIV care are common and associated with increased mortality. Early retention in HIV care is critical to improving outcomes."
8831,0.005,1.0000,"Interleukin (IL)-17-mediated immune response has been shown to play a critical role in inflammation-associated disease. However, its role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) in paediatric patients remains unknown. We investigated the frequency of T helper type 17 (Th17) cells and evaluated the association between the Th17 and clinical characters in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The frequency of Th17 cells was detected by flow cytometry analyses from 65 paediatric patients with CHB and nine healthy controls. The degree of hepatic inflammation was graded using the histological activity index (HAI). Compared with healthy controls, the frequency of Th17 cells in peripheral blood was significantly higher in paediatric patients with CHB. The proportion of Th17 cells was higher in the patients with higher HAI score (G2-G3) compared to those subjects with lower HAI score (G0-G1), but the frequency of Th17 cells had no correlation with serum HBV DNA loads or alanine aminotransferase levels. Compared with the younger age group (age 1-6 years), Th17 cell frequency was higher in the older age group (age 7-18 years). Peripheral Th17 cell frequency is associated closely with inflammation activity of liver tissues in paediatric patients with CHB."
4606,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can lead to osteoarticular involvement, usually in the late stages. The pathogenesis of these symptoms has usually been attributed to viral load or to dysregulated cytokine production. We evaluated the presence of rheumatic symptoms and levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha viral load and CD4 count in 46 patients with HIV from southern Italy. The prevalence of rheumatic symptoms was 23.9%; CD4 count and viral load presented no statistically significant differences between patients with rheumatic symptoms and patients without osteoarticular involvement, whereas TNF-alpha levels were increased in HIV patients with arthralgias compared with those in patients without arthralgias (p = 0.02). Evidence that TNF-alpha is increased in patients with osteoarticular or soft tissue involvement is a clear index of the pivotal role this cytokine plays in the pathogenesis of these manifestations."
7196,0.005,1.0000,"Several studies carried out in Western countries have demonstrated that a number of virological and immunological markers such as viral loads, cytokines, beta(2)-microglobulin, neopterin, etc., are elevated in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals with neurological disease. The neurological manifestations of HIV infection noted in Indian patients is different from those reported in Western countries. Moreover, few studies have investigated the role of virological and immunological parameters with respect to the progression of HIV-1 clade C infection in India. In this study, we measured virological (HIV-1 RNA levels) and immunological parameters (CD4 cell count and inflammatory markers) in the plasma and CSF of HIV-1-infected neurologically asymptomatic and symptomatic (with opportunistic infections and/or dementia) subjects. By using clade-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we ascertained that all samples used for the study were infected with HIV-1 clade C. Among the various laboratory parameters evaluated, high viral loads in the CSF, low CD4 counts, and higher levels of interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), beta(2)-microglobulin, and neopterin were noted in HIV-infected subjects with neurological disease as compared to asymptomatic subjects. These data suggest that the markers evaluated in plasma and CSF samples correlated with occurrence of neurological disease in symptomatic individuals as compared to asymptomatic HIV infected subjects."
7677,0.005,1.0000,"Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas were studied in fifteen autopsied patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Using the working formulation for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, the tumors were classified as large cell (7 patients), mixed large and small cell (6 patients), small cleaved cell (1 patient), and unclassifiable (1 patient). The mixed lymphomas displayed unusual features characterized by a high mitotic rate and the presence of numerous medium-sized cells (5 to 10 mus), not classifiable using the working formulation. Focal T cell and lymphoplasmacytoid B cell infiltrates accompanied lymphoma cells at the periphery of and remote from solid tumor masses in 9 cases. Immunohistochemical analysis of the lymphomas suggested B cell neoplasms. All of these patients had concurrent CNS and systemic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. The CNS infections were of both viral (CMV, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and non-viral (toxoplasmosis, candidiasis) etiology. In the general AIDS population at our institution, the autopsy incidence of CNS infections and systemic CMV was 63% and 60%, respectively. In contrast, the incidence for both these entities was 0% in otherwise healthy, non-AIDS patients with CNS lymphoma supports the hypothesis that viral infection plays a role in the pathogenesis of CNS lymphoma in the immunocompromised. Polyclonal lymphoplasmacytoid B and T cell infiltrates accompanying lymphoma may produce diagnostic difficulties on surgical biopsy. As these infiltrates were a frequent feature in this study, we caution that their recognition does not argue against the presence of CNS lymphoma."
2498,0.005,1.0000,"Prior studies have shown that weight may impact immune cell counts. However, few data exist about the relationship of weight and immune cell counts among HIV-infected patients. We examined documented HIV seroconverters (mean window, 15.7 months) in a prospective U.S. Military HIV Natural History Study (1 January 1986 to 20 January 2010). We estimated the association of the time-updated body mass index (BMI) category with changes in immune cell counts from HIV diagnosis across time (mean follow-up of 5.1 years) using multiply adjusted longitudinal linear mixed-effects models. Of 1,097 HIV seroconverters, 448 (41%) were overweight and 93 (8%) were obese at HIV diagnosis. Immune cell counts at HIV diagnosis did not significantly differ by BMI category. In the longitudinal models for those diagnosed before the advent of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, mean postdiagnosis decreases in the white cell count, total lymphocyte count, CD4 count, CD4 percentage, and CD4/CD8 ratio were less as the BMI category increased (all with P values of <0.05). Among HIV seroconverters diagnosed in the HAART era, obese compared to normal-weight patients had significantly smaller increases in CD4 counts, CD4 percentages, and the CD4/CD8 ratio (all with P values of <0.05). Similar findings were also noted among underweight versus normal-weight patients. In conclusion, although BMI was not associated with immune cell levels at the time of HIV diagnosis, weight appears to affect immune cells counts over the course of infection. In the HAART era, being either underweight or obese was associated with smaller increases in several important immune cell levels, including the CD4/CD8 ratio."
19347,0.005,1.0000,"Leptin, the protein product of the obese gene (ob), is secreted by adipocytes. Circulating leptin levels correlate with fat mass in humans, including individuals infected with HIV. Leptin serves as an adipostatic hormone, a permissive factor for reproduction and a modulator of immune function. Leptin is a cytokine, and has been demonstrated to enhance CD4 cell proliferation and IL-2 secretion from CD4 cells in vitro. The role of leptin in HIV-positive patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has not been well defined. We haveevaluated leptin levels in HIV-infected individualsduringthe early phase of HAART. We measured plasma leptin levels in 15 antiretroviral-naive HIV positive patients at baseline and after 1 and 4 weeks of HAART. After the first week of therapy, mean leptin level and CD4 count were increased compared to baseline, 6.0 vs 7.2 ng/ml (p = 0.004) and 377 vs 432 cells/ul (p = 0.014), respectively. In contrast, mean body mass index (BMI) remained unchanged 27.0 vs 26.8 kg/m2 (p < 0.08). After four weeks of therapy, leptin and BMI values were unchanged compared to baseline, 6.0 vs 5.9 (p < 0.4) and 27.0 vs 26.9 (p < 0.5), respectively, whereas CD4 count continued to increase to 491 cells/ul (p < 0.012 compared to baseline). These data demonstrate an early transient increase in plasma leptin levels in HIV positive patients initiated on HAART, despite a lack of change in BMI. It is unclear if the transient increase in leptin is related to its role as a cytokine, a metabolic regulator, or reproductive factor."
18757,0.005,1.0000,"The monocytic THP-1 cell line has been used to study HIV-monocyte/macrophage interactions and the relationship between differentiation, virus production, and virus latency. Undifferentiated THP-1 cells are susceptible to infection by T-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates that use the coreceptor CXCR4 (X4 strains). Treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induces differentiation of THP-1 cells into adherent macrophage-like cells, which are susceptible to M-tropic, CCR5-dependent isolates (R5 strains). The aim of this study was to determine whether variabilities observed in the susceptibility of THP-1 cells to HIV-1 infection may be related to the differential expression of CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4. Both propagation and PMA treatment of THP-1 cells resulted in a marked decrease in CD4-positive cells, whereas the expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 was not reduced during propagation. Both coreceptors were also relatively ""resistant"" to PMA-induced downregulation when compared with the low percentage of CD4-positive cells in differentiated cultures. In undifferentiated THP-1 cells, low CD4 expression significantly reduced the susceptibility of the cells to infection with the R5 HIV-1(BaL) isolate, whereas a PMA-induced decrease in CD4 expression reduced permissiveness of the cells to the X4 HIV-1(IIIB) isolate. Thus, cell surface CD4 plays a primary role in determining how efficiently THP-1 cells can be infected with the X4 and the R5 isolates."
12382,0.005,1.0000,"Sexual transmission is now the most frequent means of diffusion of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Even if the underlying mechanism is still largely unknown, there is a consensus regarding the key role played by mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) in capturing HIV through contact with infected subepithelial lymphocytes, and their capacity to spread HIV by trans-infection. We found that HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) reduced virion endocytosis strongly in monocyte-derived immature (i) DCs contacting HIV-1-infected cells, and that this phenomenon led to dramatically impaired trans-infection activity. This inhibitory effect was not mediated by the block of viral protease activity, as it was also operative when donor cells were infected with a PI-resistant HIV-1 strain. The block of virus maturation imposed by PIs did not correlate with significant variations in the levels of virus expression in donor cells or of Gag/Env virion incorporation. Also, PIs did not affect the endocytosis activity of DCs. In contrast, we noticed that PI treatment inhibited the formation of cell-cell conjugates whilst reducing the expression of ICAM-1 in target iDCs. Our results contribute to a better delineation of the mechanisms underlying HIV-1 trans-infection activity in DCs, whilst having implications for the development of new anti-HIV microbicide strategies."
2892,0.005,1.0000,"Macrophages and dendritic cells are known to play an important role in the establishment and persistence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Besides antiretroviral therapy, several immune-based interventions are being evaluated with the aim of achieving better control of virus replication in reservoir cells. Murabutide is a safe synthetic immunomodulator presenting a capacity to enhance nonspecific resistance against viral infections and to target cells of the reticuloendothelial system. In this study, we have examined the ability of Murabutide to control HIV type 1 (HIV-1) replication in acutely infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs). Highly significant suppression of viral replication was consistently observed in Murabutide-treated cultures of both cell types. Murabutide did not affect virus entry, reverse transcriptase activity, or early proviral DNA formation in the cytoplasm of infected cells. However, treated MDMs and MDDCs showed a dramatic reduction in nuclear viral two-long terminal repeat circular form and viral mRNA transcripts. This HIV-1-suppressive activity was not mediated by inhibiting cellular DNA synthesis or by activating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Furthermore, Murabutide-stimulated cells expressed reduced CD4 and CCR5 receptors and secreted high levels of beta-chemokines, although neutralization of the released chemokines did not alter the HIV-1-suppressive activity of Murabutide. These results provide evidence that a clinically acceptable immunomodulator can activate multiple effector pathways in macrophages and in dendritic cells, rendering them nonpermissive for HIV-1 replication."

5808,0.005,1.0000,"Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with multiple immunomodulating properties. Since NSAID's are used frequently for symptom control and, without proven efficacy, for immunopotentiation by people with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, we investigated the effects of indomethacin on T-cell lymphocyte subsets in HIV-seropositive subjects. Ten asymptomatic HIV-seropositive men participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over pilot study to determine effects of indomethacin on their CD4 ('helper') and CD8 ('suppressor') cell counts. Each subject received four weeks of drug and four weeks of placebo (or vice versa) separated by a two-week washout period. No statistically significant changes were seen in absolute CD4 or CD8 cell counts, although a modest decrease (16%) in CD8 counts occurred. These findings do not support the colloquial use of NSAID's as 'boosters' of CD4 cell counts."

To fulfill the first objective, a European case-control study was designed in the early 1990s (each KS case was matched to 2 controls with another AIDS indicative disease). After the discovery of HHV-8, serology testing enabled us to assess risk factors for KS development among HHV-8 and HIV-1 coinfected men who have sex with men (MSM), as well as risk factors for HHV-8 infection. HHV-8 seroprevalence was determined using a latent immunofluorescence assay. Relevant information was obtained by means of a questionnaire and medical charts review. Assessment of risk factors for KS development and HHV-8 infection was performed using conditional and unconditional logistic regression models, respectively. A low CD4 count was the only significant risk factor for KS. HHV-8 infection was most strongly linked to the number of life-time sex partners, and multiple body fluids such as saliva and semen are quite likely involved in sexual transmission. Longitudinal follow up showed a significant protective role for highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) both on KS development and mortality of KS patients. Although more conclusive data from cohort studies are needed to better define specific transmission mechanisms for HHV-8, our results contribute to explain why KS incidence is higher among MSM, and the decreasing KS incidence trend observed in countries with universal access to HAART."

Results of microbiological analyses were compared with self-reported gastrointestinal complaints collected using a validated questionnaire. Thirty-two (33%) patients were positive for parasites. However, opportunistic parasites (Isospora and Cryptosporidium) were detected in only 2 instances. Entamoeba dispar was detected in 10 cases, 9 of which represented men who have sex with men (MSM). Despite generally low HIV RNA loads and high CD4+ T-cell counts, 42% of the 76 patients reporting symptoms complained of diarrhoea, 31% of whom were parasite-positive. The presence of diarrhoea was not associated with the presence or absence of parasites; neither was it associated with receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) in general, or protease inhibitors (PI) in particular. A CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells/mm³ was not associated with parasitic infection or with diarrhoea. The data show that diarrhoea is a common symptom among HIV-infected patients in Denmark, but do not indicate that the diarrhoea is due to intestinal parasites."
436,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections pose a growing challenge to health care systems. Although chronic HCV infection begins as an asymptomatic condition with few short-term effects, it can progress to cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and death. The rate of new HCV infections is decreasing, yet the number of infected people with complications of the disease is increasing. In the United States, people born between 1945 and 1964 (baby boomers) are developing more complications of infection. Men and African Americans have a higher prevalence of HCV infection. Progression of fibrosis can be accelerated by factors such as older age, duration of HCV infection, sex, and alcohol intake. Furthermore, insulin resistance can cause hepatic steatosis and is associated with fibrosis progression and inflammation. If more effective therapies are not adopted for HCV, more than 1 million patients could develop HCV-related cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, or HCC by 2020, which will impact the US health care system. It is important to recognize the impact of HCV on liver disease progression and apply new therapeutic strategies."
18254,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is one of the most common infectious etiologies of acute hepatitis worldwide. The virus is known to be transmitted fecal-orally, resulting in symptoms ranging from asymptomatic infection to fulminant hepatitis. HAV can also be transmitted through oral-anal sex. Residents from regions of low endemicity for HAV infection often remain susceptible in their adulthood. Therefore, clustered HAV infections or outbreaks of acute hepatitis A among men who have sex with men and injecting drug users have been reported in countries of low endemicity for HAV infection. The duration of HAV viremia and stool shedding of HAV may be longer in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals compared to HIV-negative individuals with acute hepatitis A. Current guidelines recommend HAV vaccination for individuals with increased risks of exposure to HAV (such as from injecting drug use, oral-anal sex, travel to or residence in endemic areas, frequent clotting factor or blood transfusions) or with increased risks of fulminant disease (such as those with chronic hepatitis). The seroconversion rates following the recommended standard adult dosing schedule (2 doses of HAVRIX 1440 U or VAQTA 50 U administered 6-12 mo apart) are lower among HIV-positive individuals compared to HIV-negative individuals. While the response rates may be augmented by adding a booster dose at week 4 sandwiched between the first dose and the 6-mo dose, the need of booster vaccination remain less clear among HIV-positive individuals who have lost anti-HAV antibodies."

The goal of this study was to conduct a molecular epidemiological study of HIV-1 infection among MSM in Taiwan to identify risk factors for intervention. Voluntary counseling program and anonymous testing were provided to patrons at 1 gay bar, 7 night clubs and 3 gay saunas in Taipei and New Taipei Cities in 2012. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using gag subtype-specific PCR and phylogenetic analysis by env sequences. Recent HIV-1 infection was determined using LAg-Avidity EIA. In-depth interviews and questionnaires were used to identify risk factors. The prevalence and incidence of HIV-1 among MSM in Taiwan were 4.38% (53/1,208) and 3.29 per 100 person-years, respectively. Of 49 cases genotyped, 48 (97.9%) were infected with subtype B and 1 with CRF01_AE (2%). Phylogenetic analysis of 46 HIV-1 strains showed that 25 (54.4%) subtype B strains formed 9 clusters with each other or with other local strains. The CRF01_AE case clustered with a reference strain from a Thai blood donor with bootstrap value of 99. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that risk factors associated with HIV-1 infection included use of oil-based solution as lubricant (vs. saliva or water-based lubricants, OR= 4.23; p <0.001); exclusively receptive role (vs. insertive role, OR= 9.69; p <0.001); versatile role (vs. insertive role, OR= 6.45; p= 0.003); oral sex (vs. insertive role, OR= 11.93; p= 0.044); times of sexual contact per week (2-3 vs. zero per week, OR= 3.41; p= 0.021); illegal drug use (OR= 4.12; p <0.001); and history of sexually transmitted diseases (OR= 3.65; p= 0.002). In conclusion, there was no new HIV-1 subtype or circulating recombinant form responsible for the increase of HIV-1 among MSM in Taiwan in 2012. Misuse of oil-based solution as lubricant is a new risk factor identified among MSM in Taiwan. The Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control has created a video (www.youtube.com/watch?v=BinExvvOTMM&feature=iv&src_vid=BW81-PfmY3E&annotation_id=annotation_2436493705) to correct such misconception in its AIDS prevention campaign.

13759,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the risk factors for man-to-woman sexual transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), we carried out a cross-sectional study of 368 women who were steady partners of HIV-infected men attending 16 Italian clinical centers. Information was collected from the medical records of the infected men and by direct interviews with the women. In a logistic regression analysis, the woman's awareness of her partner's seropositivity (odds ratio [OR], 0.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0 to 1.1), use of condoms (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 1), and oral contraceptive use (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.0) were negatively associated with transmission of the HIV infection. An increased risk was found in women having sexual intercourse more than twice a week (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 4.9) and in women who had been sexually exposed to HIV for between 2 and 5 years (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.8 to 6.7). The transmission rate was higher in couples who engaged in anal sex (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3 to 6.3); in women reporting vaginitis (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.4 to 10.2) or genital warts (OR, 33.3; 95% CI, 4.5 to 244.1); and in those using intrauterine devices (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to 7.1). The risk for women was also associated with a CD4+ cell count lower than 400/mm3 in their partners. Knowledge of the HIV status of the partner led to increased condom use but did not induce a lower frequency of sexual intercourse or an avoidance of anal sex."

Public health surveillance that monitors the frequency and variety of HIV subtypes in a particular region or patient group is vital to successfully control the pandemic. We present the first comprehensive report on HIV diversity in Ireland. This study comprised all new HIV-1 diagnoses that were confirmed in the National Virus Reference Laboratory, University College Dublin, from January 2004 to December 2008. HIV 1 protease and reverse transcriptase sequences were generated using the Siemens Trugene HIV 1 Genotyping System. Subtypes were determined using web-based genotyping tools. There were 1579 new diagnoses [615 (39%) female and 964 (61%) male], of which 1060 had HIV-1 RNA specimens available for sequencing. Of sequenced samples, HIV-1 subtype B accounted for 50% overall, decreasing from 55.1% in 2004 to 49.5% in 2008. In addition, subtype B accounted for more than 80% of Irish-born individuals and more than 90% of Irish-born injection drug users and men who have sex with men. Subtype C was the second most prevalent in the overall cohort, accounting for 25%, although it accounted for only 6.1% of Irish-born individuals, with no evidence of in country transmission. The prevalence of non-subtype B HIV-1 infection in Ireland is increasing. However, these appear primarily to be imported infections not yet circulating within traditional Irish risk groups. Enhanced HIV-1 molecular epidemiology surveillance is required to monitor the spread of HIV-1, to inform future public health policy, and to ultimately control the HIV-1 epidemic in Ireland."
12083,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated the role of liver biopsy in the management of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-infected persons. Patients included had abnormal alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, detectable HCV RNA, and an interpretable liver biopsy. Demographic, epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, histological, and therapeutic data were recorded in all patients. We also registered the clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis (previous to biopsy) and whether the biopsy result deferred the decision of initiating therapy. During the 33-month duration of the study, 112 patients were included. The degree of fibrosis in liver biopsies was none or mild (F0 or F1) in 47 patients (42%) and was significant or severe in 65 (58%). Seventeen patients (15%) had histological cirrhosis. By logistic regression analysis, only portal hypertension (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 5.3 [1.05-25.9], P = 0.04) was independently associated with significant fibrosis. Overall, cirrhosis was predicted before biopsy in 29 patients (26%) by the caregiving physician, but only 8 of these were confirmed histologically. The clinical prediction of cirrhosis before biopsy had a sensitivity of 47%, a specificity of 78%, a positive predictive value of 28%, and a negative predictive value of 89%. Histological findings changed the decision to initiate HCV therapy in 19 patients (17%) because of little or no fibrosis. Liver biopsy is a useful tool in the management of HCV-HIV-coinfected persons. In addition to allowing grading and staging of the disease far better than any other method or combination of methods, it is important for making management decisions for patients coinfected with HCV and HIV."

The patient had syphilis without related physical or neurological findings. An examination for the serum antibody for HIV performed 9 years previously was negative. In a complete medical checkup at the present time, human intestinal spirochetosis and unspecified entamebic cysts were suggested by histological examination of colonic biopsy material and parasitic examination of the intestinal fluid, respectively. Moreover, a serological test for the antibody for HIV was positive. In specimens obtained by colonoscopy, Brachyspira aalborgi was diagnosed by ultrastructural study and the polymerase chain reaction method for bacterial 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid. Although HIV infection remains at low prevalence in Japan, we recommend examination for HIV infection in patients with human intestinal spirochetosis, especially when other co-infections are apparent."
8808,0.005,1.0000,"About 25% of French hemodialysis patients have antibodies against the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which may reflect either past or active HCV infection. It is important to evaluate the significance of these antibodies, as most hemodialysis patients are candidates for kidney transplantation and have normal transaminase activities despite biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis. We prospectively assayed HCV viremia with the nested polymerase chain reaction in 61 patients on maintenance hemodialysis who had anti-HCV antibodies detectable in second generation tests (ELISA2 or RIBA2). HCV RNA was repeatedly detected in the serum of 52 (85.2%) patients. Liver biopsy, which was performed in 17 cases, revealed chronic hepatitis in 16 cases (including 2 of cirrhosis) and steatosis in one. Hypertransaminasemia was observed in only 31.3% and 30.8% of patients with chronic hepatitis and HCV viremia, respectively. Anti-HCV antibodies are frequently associated with HCV viremia, resulting usually in chronic hepatitis, although hypertransaminasemia is uncommon. HCV viremia reflects both post-transfusional and community-acquired HCV infection. These findings suggest a need for liver biopsy and antiviral treatment before kidney transplantation. The isolation of anti-HCV positive subjects in the dialysis setting should be evaluated to reduce patient-to-patient transmission of HCV."
4180,0.005,1.0000,"The evidence of a higher incidence of hepatitis G virus (HGV) infection among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the relatively high prevalence of patients with primary liver carcinoma without apparent risk factors in our country motivated the present study, the objective of which was to determine the frequency of HGV-ribonucleic acid (RNA) in a series of patients with HCC. The diagnosis of HCC was established based on alpha-fetoprotein levels (>400 ng/ml), a compatible image and/or biopsy of the hepatic nodules. Markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) (HBsAg and anti-HBc), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (anti-HCV) and HGV (HGV-RNA) were investigated using MEIA and RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction). There were 32 patients evaluated, including 20 males (63%), with a mean age of 58 years. Twenty-eight (88%) patients were cirrhotic (Child-Pugh: A = 8 patients, B = 14, and C = 6) and 50% reported alcohol consumption. Serological hepatitis markers were detected in 26 (81%) patients, including HBV in 19 (59%), HCV in 12 (38%) and HGV in 9 (28%). Only one (3%) patient was positive for HGV alone. The prevalence of HGV in blood donors from the same region is 10%.

The diagnosis of TMA in HIV, which has a poorly understood pathogenesis, can be suggested by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and acute renal failure, but only definitively diagnosed by kidney biopsy. Not surprisingly, the incidence and prevalence of the HIV-specific entities have declined with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy. With this decline, however, other glomerular diseases are of increasing importance in this high-risk population. The differential diagnosis of glomerular disease in an HIV-positive patient is therefore broad. Glomerular diseases seen in this population include classic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, IgA nephropathy, postinfectious glomerulonephritis, hepatitis B- and C-related glomerulonephritides, and membranous nephropathy. In addition, as the HIV-infected population ages, diabetic and hypertensive nephropathies are likely to become more prevalent. With overlapping presentations of these entities, definitive diagnosis often is difficult, necessitating kidney biopsy. As a consequence of establishing an accurate diagnosis, improved patient outcome can best be accomplished through disease-specific intervention."
11667,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic liver infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major public health concern. Despite partly successful treatment options, several aspects of intrahepatic HCV infection dynamics are still poorly understood, including the preferred mode of viral propagation, as well as the proportion of infected hepatocytes. Answers to these questions have important implications for the development of therapeutic interventions. In this study, we present methods to analyze the spatial distribution of infected hepatocytes obtained by single cell laser capture microdissection from liver biopsy samples of patients chronically infected with HCV. By characterizing the internal structure of clusters of infected cells, we are able to evaluate hypotheses about intrahepatic infection dynamics. We found that individual clusters on biopsy samples range in size from 4-50 infected cells. In addition, the HCV RNA content in a cluster declines from the cell that presumably founded the cluster to cells at the maximal cluster extension. These observations support the idea that HCV infection in the liver is seeded randomly (e.g. from the blood) and then spreads locally. Assuming that the amount of intracellular HCV RNA is a proxy for how long a cell has been infected, we estimate based on models of intracellular HCV RNA replication and accumulation that cells in clusters have been infected on average for less than a week. Further, we do not find a relationship between the cluster size and the estimated cluster expansion time. Our method represents a novel approach to make inferences about infection dynamics in solid tissues from static spatial data."
15370,0.005,1.0000,"Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is an important cause of morbidity and death among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of respiratory specimens has been investigated as a rapid diagnostic method. We have previously reported on the utility of this technique for diagnosing PCP in HIV-infected patients. In this report we evaluate PCR used in a blinded study design to avoid biases inherent to retrospective and nonblinded studies. The diagnosis of PCP was established on the basis of clinical findings and morphological studies of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and/or lung biopsy specimens before PCR testing. PCR was performed without knowledge of the diagnosis. PCR results were graded from ""negative"" to 3+ on the basis of intensity of the banding pattern. Forty-seven patients were enrolled in the study, including 18 with proven PCP and 29 with other conditions. PCR was positive at grade 1 or higher for all 18 patients with PCP (100% sensitivity), at grade 2 or higher for 13 patients (72.2% sensitivity), and at grade 1 or higher for 4 of the 29 control patients (specificity of 86.2%). If a grade 2 or higher was required for diagnosis, the specificity improved to 100%. Results were reproducible with testing of a second aliquot for 46 of 47 patients (97.8%). Our findings confirm that PCR is a sensitive and reproducible test for detection of P. carinii in BAL specimens. Problems with false-positive results for control patients, however, limit the applicability of this method."

Necroinflammation and fibrosis was scored by the Ishak classification system, and binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess HIV and antiretroviral-related determinants of necroinflammation and fibrosis. A total of 46 biopsies were included; 33 were from HIV-positive patients co-infected with HCV and 15 biopsies were from HIV-positive patients co-infected with HBV. One HIV-positive patient was co-infected with HBV and HCV. Median biopsy inflammatory grade for the cohort was 8.5 (IQR 6-10), the median fibrosis Stage 2 (IQR 1.8-4), and the median steatosis score was 1 (IQR 0-2). At the univariate level, HIV-related variables that were significantly associated with more severe biopsy changes were higher HIV RNA at the time of biopsy (associated with inflammatory Grade 10+; P = 0.018) and any exposure to didanasine (ddI) or stavudine (D4T; associated with fibrosis Stage 3+; P = 0.022). HIV RNA at the time of biopsy remained significant at the multivariate level. Patients with HIV hepatitis co-infection in this cohort had surprisingly mild changes in liver histology, and there were no statistically significant differences between biopsy results in HBV compared to HCV co-infection. The association between HIV RNA and necroinflammation supports current recommendations for earlier initiation of HAART in patients with HIV-hepatitis co-infection."

Thirteen patients with HCV-associated myopathy have been reported previously. In most of these cases, varying degrees of inflammatory changes were observed in the muscle tissue. In 2 patients, myopathy developed after initiation of interferon therapy for chronic HCV hepatitis. Our case was unusual due to long-standing elevation of creatine kinase values which improved following interferon therapy and the non-inflammatory features of the muscle tissue where the HCV RNA minus strand, a marker for replicative intermediates of the virus, was undetectable. The association of myopathy with HCV infection might represent a unique clinical entity, although the underlying pathological mechanisms remain unknown."

We herein describe the case of a patient with HBV and human immunodeficiency virus whose chronic hepatitis was stabilized due to HBe and HBs seroconversion with the emergence of lamivudine-associated and core mutations after CD4 elevation. A full-length HBV DNA analysis indicated that HBsAg had been lost after the development of the rtS143T mutation, which corresponded to the emergence of the sF134L and core mutations. The details of this case shed some light on the mechanisms associated with HBsAg and HBeAg clearance. "

We studied longitudinally the viruses obtained before and after fulminant liver disease in a patient with chronic HBV infection showing fatal exacerbation. HBV strains were obtained before and after exacerbation (designated as FEP1 and FEP2). Their virological features were investigated by in vitro transfection. FEP1 and FEP2 possessed higher activity of overall HBV DNA synthesis than the wild-type. FEP1 lacked competence for relaxed circular (RC) HBV DNA synthesis and RC HBV DNA-containing virion secretion, but FEP2 maintained it. Chimeric analysis revealed that the preS/S gene, where FEP1 had a considerable number of mutations and deletions but FEP2 did not, was responsible for impaired RC HBV DNA synthesis and virion secretion. Furthermore, incompetence of FEP1 strain was transcomplemented by the preS/S protein of wild-type strain. In conclusion, the viral strain after exacerbation showed resurgent RC HBV DNA synthesis and virion secretion, which was caused by conversion of the preS/S gene from a hypermutated to hypomutated state. This may have been responsible for disease deterioration in the patient. This is a novel type of HBV genomic variation associated with the development of fulminant liver disease."

We developed an animal model in which HBV-infected human hepatocytes are targeted by HBV-specific CTLs. After HBV inoculation in human hepatocyte-transplanted herpes simplex virus type-1 thymidine kinase-NOG mice, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were administered, and albumin, HBV DNA, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and cytokine levels were analyzed. Histopathological and flow-cytometric analysis of infiltrating human immune cells were performed, and the efficacy of CTL-associated antigen-4 immunoglobulin (CTLA4Ig) against liver damage was evaluated. PBMC treatment resulted in massive hepatocyte damage with elevation of ALT, granzyme A, and gamma interferon and decrease in albumin and HBV DNA. The number of liver-infiltrating human lymphocytes and CD8-positive cells was significantly higher in HBV-infected mice. HBV-specific CTLs were detected by core and polymerase peptide-major histocompatibility complex-tetramer, and the population of regulatory T cells was significantly decreased in HBV-infected mice. Serum hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen became negative, and HBs antibody appeared. CTLA4Ig treatment strongly inhibited infiltration of mononuclear cells. CTLA4Ig treatment will be used to treat patients who develop severe acute hepatitis B to prevent liver transplantation or lethality. This animal model is useful for virological and immunological analysis of HBV infection and to develop new therapies for severe acute hepatitis B."

Most hemophiliacs received locally produced cryoprecipitate. All infected patients were transfused before the screening of blood units for anti-HCV. However, hemophiliacs who received exclusively screened cryoprecipitate were HCV negative. It confirms the expected decline in transfusion-acquired hepatitis C."

The aim of this study was to prospectively identify factors predictive of the clinical course in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Patients were stratified by ALT and HBeAg status and followed every 3 months for up to 5 years. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis using the change from normal ALT to elevated ALT as endpoints were performed to determine factors associated with ALT elevation/normalization. Seventy-four HBeAg-negative and 32 HBeAg-positive patients were prospectively evaluated. For HBeAg-negative patients, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was predictive of future ALT. Only 1 patient with normal ALT and an HBV DNA value lower than 10,000 copies/mL developed an elevated ALT within the subsequent year, whereas 67% with an HBV DNA value greater than 100,000 copies/mL had a rise in ALT above normal within 1 year. Patients with a previous history of ALT elevation and longer follow-up at all levels of HBV DNA were more likely to experience ALT elevations. For HBeAg-negative patients with elevated ALT and all HBeAg-positive patients, HBV DNA did not predict future ALT. Other viral and host factors were not predictive of future ALT."

It has been reported that as high as 50% of HBsAg-positive individuals who undergo chemotherapy develop elevation of liver transaminases. According to current Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines, prophylactic lamivudine should be routinely administered to HBsAg-positive patients with malignancy before chemotherapy. However, occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, defined as HBsAg negative and HBV DNA positive, regardless of HBV core antibody (anti-HBc) status, is not infrequent in HBV endemic areas. Here, we report the case of a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma female patient who was negative for HBsAg, but positive for anti-HBc at the time of chemotherapy. Unfortunately, she developed a fatal HBV reactivation after completing the course of chemotherapy. This case highlights the potential role of lamivudine or other nucleos(t)ide analogue prophylaxis in anti-HBc-positive malignant patient who is about to undergo chemotherapy to provide better coverage for occult HBV infection."

Fecal suspensions of genotypes 1 and 4 from patients, as well as genotype 4 from swine, were inoculated intravenously into rhesus macaques. Each inoculum contained 5 x 10(4) genome equivalents of HEV. After infection, serum and fecal samples were collected serially and the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and anti-HEV IgG and IgM in sera, and HEV RNA in fecal samples, were measured. Liver biopsies were carried out. All the infected monkeys (12/12) developed anti-HEV IgG and exhibited fecal shedding of virus. IgM was detected in 11 of 12, and ALT elevation occurred about 2-6 weeks post-inoculation in 10 of 12, infected monkeys. Hepatic histopathology was consistent with acute viral hepatitis and the ORF2 antigen of HEV was detected in the granular cytoplasm of hepatocytes by immunohistochemistry. After recovery from their initial HEV infection, the monkeys were challenged with a heterologous genotype or heterologous source of HEV and monitored for hepatitis and fecal shedding. Previous infection with HEV completely or partially protected against subsequent challenge with a heterologous virus, because 7 of 11 monkeys did not develop HEV infection or shed virus in the feces, and none of them developed hepatitis or exhibited ALT elevation or liver biopsy findings of hepatitis. In conclusion, previous HEV infection may give rise to cross-genotype and cross-host-species protection."

A total of 1095 patients were interviewed in 15 dialysis units. Serum samples were screened for HBV serological markers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive samples were tested for HBV DNA by polymerase chain reaction and genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Global HBV infection prevalence was 29.8% (95% CI: 27.1-32.5). Multivariate analysis of risk factors showed that male gender, length of time on hemodialysis, and blood transfusion before 1993 were associated with HBV positivity. HBV DNA was detected in 65.4% (17/26) of the HBsAg-positive samples. Thirteen of 17 HBV DNA positive samples were genotyped.

Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) plays a key role in innate immunity and is responsible for recognizing viral pathogens. It has been reported that the TLR3 C1234T polymorphism is associated with various diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate whether TLR3 polymorphisms were correlated with susceptibility to chronic HBV infection. Two polymorphisms in the TLR3 gene, A952T and C1234T, were tested by direct sequencing in 452 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 462 healthy controls. Data showed that subjects carrying 1234CT genotype and TT genotype had 1.42-fold and 2.31-fold increased risk of chronic HBV infection compared to those with CC genotype (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.08-1.86, p = 0.012; 95 % CI = 1.34-3.96, p = 0.002, respectively). Further analysis revealed that the prevalence of 1234CT genotype and T allele was significantly increased in CHB patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) than those without ACLF (odds ratio [OR] = 1.55, p = 0.030; OR = 1.43, p = 0.040, respectively). These results indicate that TLR3 C1234T polymorphism could be a risk factor for the development of chronic HBV infection, especially the CHB-related ACLF."

Serum samples were collected from 10,321 first blood donation voluntary male donors. All samples were screened for anti-HIV and anti-HCV by particle agglutination test, and syphilis antibody by RPR. The anti-HIV positive sera were repeated by EIA and confirmed by western blot. The reactive anti-HCV samples were confirmed by EIA whereas reactive syphilis antibody samples were confirmed by TPPA. Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analysis. The prevalence of anti-HIV in first time male donors was 0.70 per cent (72/10,321). The age of HIV group and 10,018 male control group ranged from 17-50 years old. The prevalence of HIV among 21-40 years old age group was significantly higher than the 17-20 years old (p = 0.00003). The 17-20 years old HIV group showed significantly higher sero-prevalence of TPPA (p = 0.003). The 21-30 years old HIV group gave significantly higher sero-prevalence of anti-HCV (p = 0.0008) and TPPA (p = 0.045), but the seroprevalence of anti-HCV and TPPA among the 31-50 year old group were nonsignificantly different (p > 0.05). The concurrence of anti-HCV and TPPA in HIV groups was not found.

Patients were treated with standard short-course anti-TB treatment (2EHRZ3/4RH3) and were randomized to receive ddI/3TC with either nevirapine or efavirenz, once daily. Genotypic drug resistance (DR) testing was carried out for the pol gene at baseline and at the time of virological failure. At baseline, major DRMs with respect to NNRTIs (G190GA) and TAMs (T215S and I) were observed in 3 out of 107 patients. Of 15 treatment failures, 14 had more than one major NRTI and NNRTI mutation. V106M was the major NNRTI mutation that emerged in EFZ and Y181C in the NVP group. Among NRTI mutations, M184V was the commonest followed by L74I/V. Primary drug resistance to antiretroviral drugs was low among HIV-1 co-infected TB patients in south India.

In addition to the high prevalence of chronic HCV, particularly among HIV-infected injection drug users, the rate of incident HIV infections is increasing among HIV-infected men who have sex with men, leading to recommendations for education and screening for HCV in this population. Liver disease is the second leading and, in some cases, a preventable cause of death among coinfected patients. Those at risk for liver disease progression are usually treated with a combination of interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), which is not highly effective; it has low rates of sustained virologic response (SVR), especially for coinfected patients with HCV genotype 1 and those of African descent. Direct-acting antivirals might overcome factors such as immunodeficiency that can reduce the efficacy of IFN. However, for now it remains challenging to treat coinfected patients due to interactions among drugs, additive drug toxicities, and the continued need for combination therapies that include pegylated IFN. Recently developed HCV protease inhibitors such as telaprevir and boceprevir, given in combination with pegylated IFN and RBV, could increase the rate of SVR with manageable toxicity and drug interactions. We review the latest developments and obstacles to treating coinfected patients."

We compared the characteristics of hepatitis C in two groups of hematologic patients with different levels of immunocompetence who acquired the same virus strain after treatment with contaminated intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). Indications for IVIG therapy were idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in six patients and hypogammaglobulinemia in 7 patients with various hematologic disorders, who were defined immunodeficient (ID). Infection rate was 100%. Five ID patients never developed HCV antibodies despite serum HCV-RNA positivity. The same HCV genotype was shown in 10 patients tested. Moreover, E1-E2 gene partial nucleotide sequencing, performed in four patients, showed identical or closely related amino acid sequences, thus strongly supporting the hypothesis of a common source of infection. Clinical acute infection did not differ significantly between the two groups, but subsequent liver failure developed in five of the seven ID patients and in none of the ITP patients (P = .04). Liver biopsy, performed in three cases, documented HCV as the only cause of liver damage. Six ID patients died, with liver disease being the primary cause of death in four cases and a contributory cause in two cases. Their median survival after IVIG was 12 months, significantly worse than that of ITP patients (P = .0028). We conclude that immunodeficiency markedly worsens the course of IVIG-acquired HCV infection in hematologic patients."

The baseline host factors such as age, the degree of liver fibrosis progression and a genetic polymorphism near the IL28B gene, the viral factors such as HCV genotype, mutant virus at HCV core region and interferon sensitivity determining region, the treatment factors such as drug adherence and treatment duration have been reported to be associated with SVR. The risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence was significantly lower in SVR patients than non-SVR patients. Especially, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels decreased through therapy, and the patients with < 5 ng/mL had a low potential of HCC incidence regardless of HCV eradication. It is suggested that AFP levels at 24 weeks after the treatment can be a good surrogate marker for HCC incidence irrespective of the virologic response."

In the HBV monoinfection scenario, only two cases of TDF-associated Fanconi syndrome have been reported thus far. Here, we describe two additional patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who developed a TDF-induced Fanconi syndrome that reverted after TDF withdrawal and had viral replication fully suppressed upon switching to entecavir (ETV).

Effective and individualized treatment of chronic hepatitis B to prevent progression to end-stage liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma is needed. HBV can be classified into eight genotypes (A-H) on the basis of genome sequence divergence. In addition, several naturally occurring HBV mutants have also been identified. The epidemiology of HBV genotypes and their implications for response to antiviral therapy have become increasingly recognized. Recent studies suggested that responses to standard interferon treatment in patients with genotype A or B are better than those with genotype C or D; however, conflicting results exist regarding the response to pegylated interferon. The influence of dose and duration on interferon-based therapy remains to be clarified. In addition to genotype, naturally occurring mutations such as precore and core promoter mutations have also attracted much attention, because they have been shown to affect the disease progression of HBV-related chronic liver disease and possibly the response to antiviral therapy. Here, we review the differences in antiviral theraputic response among HBV genotypes and discuss the role of precore or core promoter mutations in response to antiviral therapy."

We estimated the proportion of patients with high adherence and the hazard ratio (HR) of 20% or more increase in the CD4(+) cell count and of reaching an undetectable viral load. The proportion of patients with high adherence to treatment was highest in the DAART group. The probability of 20% or more increase in the CD4(+) cell count was significantly lower in the two control groups versus the DAART group (SAT group HR=0.32; OUT group HR=0.43). The HR of observing an undetectable HIV-RNA level versus DAART was significantly lower in the OUT group (HR: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-0.97) but did not reach statistical significance for the SAT group (HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.74-1.33). Our findings after a 24-month follow-up, suggest that DAART in HIV-infected patients of drug-rehabilitation communities improves adherence, immunologic, and virologic outcome toward free outpatients. Even if our retrospective 36-month data do not show a prolonged viral suppression in these patients, DAART may be considered a valuable therapeutic and educational strategy in this particular target group."
10767,0.005,1.0000,"Interactive toxicity beliefs regarding mixing alcohol and antiretroviral therapy (ART) may influence ART adherence. HIV-infected patients in Uganda completed quarterly visits for 1 year, or one visit at 6 months, depending on study randomization. Past month ART non-adherence was less than daily or <100 % on a visual analog scale. Participants were asked if people who take alcohol should stop taking their medications (belief) and whether they occasionally stopped taking their medications in anticipation of drinking (behavior). Visits with self-reported alcohol use and ART use for ≥30 days were included. We used logistic regression to examine correlates of the interactive toxicity belief and behavior, and to determine associations with ART non-adherence. 134 participants contributed 258 study visits. The toxicity belief was endorsed at 24 %, the behavior at 15 %, and any non-adherence at 35 % of visits. In multivariable analysis, the odds of non-adherence were higher for those endorsing the toxicity behavior [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.06; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.97-4.36] but not the toxicity belief (AOR 0.63; 95 % CI 0.32-1.26). Clear messaging about maintaining adherence, even if drinking, could benefit patients."
4812,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated behavior change after disclosure of a positive hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody test result among a cohort of young injection drug users (IDUs). Participants underwent semiannual interviews, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV antibody testing, and pretest and posttest counseling. We used chi(2) statistics to study changes in the frequencies of high-risk behaviors from baseline to a 6-month follow-up visit among 46 IDUs who had a positive HCV test result and among 60 IDUs who did not have a positive HCV test result or who were unaware of their test result. No significant differences were detected between the 2 groups. Both groups continued to share syringes, needles, and other injection paraphernalia. These findings suggest that young IDUs may not be aware of the risk of HCV infection and highlight the urgent need for post-HCV test guidelines and behavioral interventions to reduce ongoing high-risk behavior that perpetuates the risk of HCV transmission."
737,0.005,1.0000,"To delineate the relationship between adherence to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) therapy and sexual behavior among HIV type 1-infected women in the United States, data were collected from October 1998 through March 1999 from 766 HIV-positive women on adherence to therapy, risk behavior, and disease markers. Adherence rates of >/=95% were reported by 66% of the patients. In multivariate analyses, patients with lower rates of adherence tended to be younger (odds ratio [OR], 1.69), to be active drug users (OR, 2.27), to have detectable virus load levels (OR, 2.00), and to have a lower quality of life (OR, 1.20). Among sexually active women, lower adherence rates were associated with an increased risk for inconsistent condom use (adjusted OR, 2.17). Although counseling regarding sexual behavior and adherence to treatment regimens are often addressed separately, our data highlight the importance of discussing these factors in relation to one another, particularly with regard to patients experiencing virologic failure."
10783,0.005,1.0000,"To study the prevalence of HIV and infections with related transmission patterns, we interviewed and obtained blood samples from 220 injecting drug users (IDUs), sampled by snowballing, from the city of Santos in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, where the estimated number of IDUs (10,000) comprises approximately 2% of the entire population. Seroprevalence of HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis, and HTLV (1 and 2) was assessed and compared with that in 197 blood donors from the same city, matched for age and gender. Risk behavior related to HIV was assessed by a standard questionnaire applied to the IDU sample. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the risk factors were performed. Seroprevalences found were 62% for HIV, 75% for HCV, 75% for HBV, 34% for syphilis, and 25% for HTLV (1 and 2) among IDUs, which compare with 0.0%, 2%, 23%, 12%, and 1% for blood donors, respectively. The risk for parenterally transmitted infections in this IDU community was higher than that for sexually transmitted infections (odds ratio for syphilis, 3.57; hepatitis B, 10.0; and hepatitis C, 100). The results of the mutivariate risk analysis showed that daily rate of ID use >5 times/day (OR = 6.73), not changing behavior to avoid AIDS (OR= 3.28), ID use >15 days/month (OR = 2.72), and ID use in the last 2 months (OR = 2.23) were the risk behaviors significantly associated with HIV infection."
19455,0.005,1.0000,"In order to prepare for a possible trial of a preventive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine in a population of injection drug users (IDUs) we followed a cohort to determine their HIV incidence, compliance with follow-up visits at 3-month intervals (i.e., quarterly) and their attitudes toward HIV vaccine trial participation. A population of 671 HIV-seronegative subjects were recruited from a cohort of IDUs already in follow-up in Baltimore, MD (the ALIVE study). We detected 19 seroconverters in 1677.80 person-quarters of follow-up, an annual incidence of 4.52/100 person-years. Compliance with quarterly follow-up was 93% at 6 months and 89% at 9 months. Although many subjects (n = 104) are not yet due for their 12-month visit, compliance to date has been 76%. The most sensitive risk behaviors associated with HIV seroconversion have been continued injection of illicit drugs and the frequency of drug use. Other reported drug associated risk behaviors, e.g., needle sharing and shooting gallery use, have decreased despite a high HIV incidence; we believe some of the reported reductions in high-risk behavior represent socially desirable responses by the study subjects. Although the difficulties in successfully doing a trial of an HIV vaccine in the population should not be underestimated, our data suggest that such a trial would be feasible."
10294,0.005,1.0000,"Serologic tests for human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and hepatitis B virus infections were conducted in 1986 in two Japanese immigrant colonies located in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. A total of 322 adults (283 Japanese and 39 Bolivians) over age 35 years and 305 children (166 Japanese, 124 Bolivians, and 15 of mixed blood) aged 8-17 years were sampled at the time of a routine health checkup. The prevalence of antibody to HTLV-I was 17% in first-generation Japanese immigrants and 6% in second- or third-generation Japanese children. Prevalences among native Bolivians were 3% and 5% in adults and children, respectively. Seropositive Japanese immigrants and mothers showed clustering according to birthplace in endemic areas of Japan. The prevalence of either hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) or antibody to HBsAg was 48% in Japanese adults, 21% in Japanese children, 13% in Bolivian adults, and 1% in Bolivian children. Seropositive adults did not show clustering according to birthplace, but children in one colony showed clustering and a narrow age range. A correlation of seropositivity between husbands and wives was found only for HTLV-I. The seropositivity was independent of whether an HTLV-I or a hepatitis B virus infection marker was present."
10877,0.005,1.0000,"Twenty-two vertically human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected Brazilian children were studied for antiretroviral drug resistance. They were separated into 2 groups according to the administration of antiretroviral therapy into those who presented disease symptoms or without symptoms and no therapy. Viral genome sequencing reactions were loaded on an automated DNA sampler (TruGene, Visible Genetics) and compared to a database of wild type HIV-1. In the former group 8 of 12 children presented isolates with mutations conferring resistance to protease inhibitors (PIs), 7 presented isolates resistant to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and 2 presented isolates resistant to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Ten children were included in the antiretroviral na ve group. Eight were susceptible to NRTIs and all of them were susceptible to PIs; one presented the V108I mutation, which confers low-level resistance to NNRTIs. The data report HIV mutant isolates both in treated and untreated infants. However, the frequency and the level of drug resistance were more frequent in the group receiving antiretroviral therapy, corroborating the concept of selective pressure acting on the emergence of resistant viral strains. The children who presented alterations at polymorphism sites should be monitored for the development of additional mutations occurring at relevant resistance codons."
14767,0.005,1.0000,"The enzyme-linked immunospot (ELIspot) assay is a highly sensitive and valuable tool for determining the frequency of cytokine-secreting T cells. It is essential to determine both frequencies and functional capabilities of antigen-specific T cells, including cytokine secretion, degranulation, and cytotoxicity in order to obtain a fuller picture of the immune status of an individual. We describe here for the first time a perforin-release ELIspot assay which, when used in combination with IFN-gamma and IL-4 ELIspots, permits rapid assessment of these functional parameters for antigen-specific T cells. Whole antigen or peptides from HIV-1, recall and other viral antigens were used for in vitro stimulation. Anti-HIV-1 responses in treated chronically infected individuals were weak, both in terms of perforin and IFN-gamma production. Tetanus toxoid stimulation was associated with moderate perforin release and a predominantly type-2 IL-4 producing response, whilst herpes simplex virus antigen stimulation resulted in perforin release but only a weak type-1 IFN-gamma response. Anti-cytomegalovirus responses generated high levels of perforin in conjunction with IFN-gamma. Cytokines IL-2 and IL-12/IL-15 induced perforin release coupled with an IFN-gamma type-1 response. Perforin release strongly correlated with IFN-gamma production to individual influenza, Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus MHC class I restricted peptides, in an HIV-1 sero-negative cohort, indicating a cytolytic type-1 CD8+ T-cell response. Evaluation of immunogenicity and putative efficacy of candidate vaccines using IFN-gamma will not be as informative alone as when combined with perforin and IL-4 evaluations, which allow assessment of specific cytotoxic potential without extensive cell culture."

Antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected adults who presented to an outpatient clinic in an urban hospital in Boston for initial evaluation in 1999 were screened for drug-selected resistance mutations and phylogenetic subtype. Drug-selected mutations were identified in 16 (18%) of 88 subjects. Twelve (14%) included mutations associated with nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, 4 (5%) included mutations associated with nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, and 3 (3%) included mutations associated with protease inhibitors. Two (2%) had resistance mutations associated with multiple classes of drugs. Nine (10%) subjects had infection with non-B subtype HIV-1 and did not have drug-selected mutations.

19046,0.005,1.0000,"We analyzed drug resistance in HIV-infected Ugandan children who received antiretroviral therapy in a prospective, observational study (2004-2006); some children had prior single-dose nevirapine (sdNVP) exposure. Children received stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), and nevirapine (NVP); treatment was continued if they were clinically and immunologically stable. Samples with >1,000 copies/ml HIV RNA were analyzed by using the ViroSeq HIV Genotyping System (ViroSeq). Subtype A and D pretreatment samples also were analyzed with the LigAmp assay (for K103N, Y181C, and G190A). ViroSeq results were obtained for 74 pretreatment samples (35 from sdNVP-exposed children (median age, 19 months) and 39 from sdNVP-unexposed children (median age, 84 months). This included 39 subtype A, 22 subtype D, 1 subtype C, and 12 inter-subtype recombinant samples. One sample had nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance, one had nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance, and three had protease inhibitor (PI) resistance. Y181C was detected by using LigAmp in five pretreatment samples [four (14.8%) of 37 samples from sdNVP-exposed children, one (4.2%) of 24 samples from children without prior sdNVP exposure; p = 0.35]. Among children who were not virally suppressed at 48 weeks of treatment, all 12 tested had NNRTI resistance, as well as resistance to 3TC and emtricitibine (FTC); three had resistance to other NRTIs. Seven of those children had a ViroSeq result at 96 weeks of treatment; four of the seven acquired resistance to additional NRTIs by 96 weeks. In Uganda, clinically and immunologically stable children receiving nonsuppressive antiretroviral treatment regimens are at risk for development of drug resistance."
18880,0.005,1.0000,"We studied the evolution of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance mutations among 29 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients who experienced virologic failure when receiving an NNRTI-containing regimen (nevirapine, delavirdine, or efavirenz) and subsequently switched to antiretroviral therapy without NNRTIs. Genotypic resistance was determined from plasma samples collected at the time of NNRTI withdrawal (baseline) and during follow-up. At baseline, 83% of patients had more than two thymidine analog resistance mutations (TAMs), and all had NNRTI resistance mutations. Mutations at codons 103, 181, and 190 were found in 62, 62, and 34% of the patients, respectively. Follow-up samples were available after a median time of 6 months in all patients and at 12 months in 22 patients. The mean number of resistance mutations to NNRTIs was significantly lower at months 6 (1.34 +/- 1.04) and 12 (1.18 +/- 1.05) than at month 0 (2.03 +/- 1.02) (P < 0.009). The percentages of patients with at least one NNRTI resistance mutation were 100, 76, and 73% at baseline, month 6, and month 12, respectively (P < 0.0044). Overall, 70% of the patients had a mutation at codon 103 or 181 at month 12. The mean number of TAMs did not vary significantly during follow-up. Our data show that, in the context of maintained antiretroviral therapy, NNRTI resistance mutations persist in two-thirds of the patients in spite of NNRTI withdrawal. These results argue for the low impact of NNRTI resistance mutations on viral fitness and suggest that resistance mutations to different classes of drugs are associated on the same genome, at least in some of the resistant strains."

14889,0.005,1.0000,"One-hundred seven consecutive patients attending a New York Hansen's disease clinic from November 1990 through June 1991 were tested for retroviruses. This cohort included 58 patients diagnosed with Hansen's disease after the onset of the AIDS epidemic, 54 of whom immigrated to the United States before diagnosis of Hansen's disease (median, 7 years). The overall rate (1.9%) of human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type I infection was low. Two (3.6%) of 55 Caribbean-born patients had polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-documented HTLV-I infection, but this incidence was not higher than expected in persons without Hansen's disease. No patient had PCR-documented evidence of either HTLV-II or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection. The low rate of HIV-1 among those studied was likely related to an absence of classic HIV risk behavior because about half of the cohort could have incubated Mycobacterium leprae for a prolonged period while infected with HIV-1."
204,0.005,1.0000,"Individuals who have been exposed to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and have not been infected might possess natural resistance mechanisms. An understanding of the sociodemographic and immunological conditions that influence resistance to HIV is a challenge, and very little is known about the role of intrinsic antiviral factors that restrict HIV infection. The aim of this study was to analyze potential factors responsible for resistance to HIV infection in serodiscordant couples by comparing HIV-exposed seronegative individuals (HESN) to HIV-seropositive individuals treated with antiretroviral therapy (HIV-ART) along with healthy controls (HC). The results revealed one HLA-B*27 and two HLA-B*57 individuals among the HESN; a CCR5Δ32 heterozygous deletion was observed in one serodiscordant couple, while the homozygous genotype for this variant was not observed. There were no differences in the basal mRNA expression of APOBEC3G, CFLAR, TRIM5α, LEDGF/p75, BST-2, or SAMHD1 in CD4(+) T lymphocyte- and monocyte-enriched populations among the three groups, and lower HBD-3 concentrations were observed in saliva from HIV-ART compared to HESN and HC. The most prevalent HIV-1 subtype was C or C-containing recombinant forms. Six HIV-ART individuals and one HIV-ART individual were infected with the R5 HIV and X4 HIV strains, respectively. The ability to control infection or delay disease progression is probably defined by a balance between viral and host factors, and further evaluation should be performed in larger cohorts. Our data suggest that susceptibility to HIV infection varies among individuals and strengthens the multifactorial characteristics underlying the resistance mechanisms in HIV. "
2925,0.005,1.0000,The authors report two cases of unusual venous thrombosis associated with protein S deficiency in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The first case was a superior mesenteric vein thrombosis caused by HIV-1 infection associated with protein S deficiency in a 53-year-old patient. The second case was a cerebral venous thrombosis in a 34-year-old patient with HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections associated with protein S deficiency. None of the two patients were receiving antiretroviral therapy at the time of diagnosis. The evolution of thrombosis was favorable in both patients with heparin therapy and antivitamin K (AVK).
1193,0.005,1.0000,"Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma often present with multiple poor prognostic features, including significant tumor burden, advanced immunosuppression, and other concurrent morbidities. Strategies to manage such complex multiple-disease cases have often incorporated the assumption that prospects for long-term survival are poor and that intensive therapy cannot be tolerated and so is not justified. Since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus infection, life expectancy has improved substantially for patients in whom the virus can be successfully suppressed. Thus, for complicated cases involving AIDS-associated malignancy, a reassessment of treatment strategies and the potential for long-term survival is warranted. Here, we present the case of a patient with poor prognosis due to AIDS-associated lymphoma with leptomeningeal involvement, advanced immunosuppression, and deep venous thrombosis. The management of this case illustrates that a multidisciplinary approach to complex AIDS cases involving malignancy and concurrent morbidity can result in a return to functional health in affected patients. Successful strategies for achieving favorable outcomes currently exist with available therapies."
7266,0.005,1.0000,"Peripheral neuropathy is the most frequent neurological complication associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection and advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). There are at least 6 patterns of HIV-associated peripheral neuropathy, although these diagnoses are often overlooked or misdiagnosed. Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSP) is the most common form of peripheral neuropathy in HIV infection. DSP occurs mainly in patients with advanced immunosuppression and may also be secondary to the neurotoxicity of several antiretroviral agents. Treatment of painful DSP is primarily symptomatic, while pathogenesis-based therapies are under investigation. Reduction or discontinuation of neurotoxic agents should be considered if possible. Inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (IDP) can present in an acute or chronic form. The acute form may occur at the time of primary HIV infection or seroconversion. Cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytic pleocytosis (10 to 50 cells/mm3) is helpful in the diagnosis of HIV-associated IDP. Treatment consists of immunomodulatory therapy. Progressive polyradiculopathy (PP) most commonly occurs in advanced immunosuppression and usually is caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Rapidly progressive flaccid paraparesis, radiating pain and paresthesias, areflexia and sphincter dysfunction are the cardinal clinical features. Rapid diagnosis and treatment with anti-CMV therapy are necessary to prevent irreversible neurological deficits resulting from nerve root necrosis. Mononeuropathy multiplex (MM) that occurs in early HIV infection is characterised by self-limited sensory and motor deficits in the distribution of individual peripheral nerves. In advanced HIV infection, multiple nerves in two or more extremities or cranial nerves are affected. Treatment includes immunomodulation or anti-CMV therapy. Autonomic neuropathy may be caused by central or peripheral nervous system abnormalities. Treatment is supportive with correction of metabolic or toxic causes. Diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome (DILS) presents as a Sjögren's-like disorder with CD8 T cell infiltration of multiple organs. Antiretroviral therapy and steroids may be effective treatments."
15722,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are a common neurological manifestation of HIV infection. A previous study suggested that HIV dementia may be more common among patients with subtype D virus than among those with subtype A virus among HIV+ individuals with advanced immunosuppression. We conducted a study to evaluate the frequency of HIV dementia, and the association of HIV dementia with HIV subtype and compartmentalization among HIV+ individuals with moderate and advanced immunosuppression (CD4 lymphocyte count >150 cells/μL and <250 cells/μL). The study enrolled 117 antiretroviral naïve HIV+ individuals in Kampala, Uganda. HIV+ individuals received neurological, neuropsychological testing, and functional assessments, and gag and gp41 regions were subtyped. Subjects were considered infected with a specific subtype if both regions analyzed were from the same subtype. 41% of the HIV+ individuals had HIV dementia (mean CD4 lymphocyte count = 233 cells/μL). 67 individuals had subtype A, 25 individuals had subtype D, 24 individuals were classified as A/D recombinants, and one individual had subtype C. There was no difference in the frequency of HIV dementia when stratified by HIV subtype A and D and no association with compartmentalization between the cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood. These results suggest that HIV dementia is common in HIV+ individuals in Uganda. There was no association between HIV subtype and dementia among HIV+ individuals with moderate and advanced immunosuppression. Future studies should be performed to confirm these results."
6316,0.005,1.0000,"Pyomyositis, a common disease in the tropics, is rare in the continental United States, with approximately 83 cases described in the literature in the past two decades. The occurrence of pyomyositis complicating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been reported in 10 patients since 1986. We report six cases of this entity in patients with advanced HIV disease seen in our institution over a 20-month period. A common denominator in all of our patients was muscle injury, induced by either exercise or trauma. Unlike most previous reports of HIV-associated pyomyositis, the clinical picture in our cases was complicated by the development of abscesses in multiple muscle groups, requiring prolonged antimicrobial therapy and repeated drainage procedures for successful management. Interestingly, one patient developed concomitant rhabdomyolysis--an otherwise rare event in classical pyomyositis. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant infecting organism in this as well as all other series. Of note, we also observed and report the first case, to our knowledge, of gram-negative pyomyositis in an HIV-infected individual. The pathogenic implications of this catalase-producing gram-negative isolate are discussed in the context of neutrophil abnormalities in HIV disease."

A phase II study over a 4-year period in a tertiary care university hospital was carried out. 52 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-patients with advanced KS received long-term chemotherapy (71+/-51 weeks) with a mean of 22.8+/-18.2 cycles and a mean cumulative liposomal doxorubicin dose of 456+/-364 mg/m(2) (120-1040 mg/m(2)). Tumour burden, duration and dosage of PegLiposomal DOX, adverse events, opportunistic infections, immunological parameters and HIV load were measured. A complete (10%) or partial response (56%) was achieved while on chemotherapy. 10 patients (19%) showed stable disease. Tumour progression was observed in 8 patients (15%). Importantly, chemotherapy with PegLiposomal DOX was also successful after previous cytostatic therapy with bleomycin and vincristine. The most common adverse events included leucopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, and increased liver function tests. 34 patients (65%) developed new opportunistic infections and 29 patients (56%) died during the study period. To conclude, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is a safe and effective drug for long-term chemotherapy of advanced (AIDS) KS without adverse effects on CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load."

HIV-1-infected patients with advanced HIV disease (baseline CD4+ cell count between 50 and 250 x 10(6)/L) were included in a prospective cohort followed up for 36 months. In the 113 patients included, 22 first AIDS-defining events were reported. Cumulative probability of AIDS was 12% at M12, 18% at M24, and 20% at M36. Using a Cox model, the baseline level of sTNFR-II (hazard ratio of 3.75 for sTNFR-II > or =10 ng/ml vs < 10 ng/ml, P = 0.01) was associated with progression to AIDS. sTNFR-II remained a prognostic factor before and after the introduction of combinations of antiretrovirals. Whether or not this marker is of value in patients exclusively treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy needs to be assessed in specific studies."
16099,0.005,1.0000,"Venous thrombotic events (VTEs) may occur at higher rates among patients with HIV; some studies suggest that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may increase the risk for these potentially life-threatening events. We performed a retrospective study among patients with HIV to evaluate the incidence and risk factors for VTEs during the HAART era. A literature review was performed examining VTEs in the pre- and post-HAART eras. Seventeen (3.7%) of 465 patients with HIV experienced a VTE. The overall incidence rate of deep VTEs among HIV-positive persons was 377 cases per 100,000 person-years, a fourfold higher rate compared to age-matched males in the general population. The median age at VTE was 36 years (range, 27-68). Patients with a thrombosis compared to those without had significantly lower current CD4 (153 versus 520 cells/mm(3), p < 0.001) and nadir (76 versus 276 cells/mm(3), p < 0.001) CD4 counts, higher viral loads (3.6 versus 1.7 log(10) copies per milliliter, p = 0.003), and more likely to have a diagnosis of AIDS (76% versus 32%, p < 0.001); there were no differences in demographics, hyperlipidemia, current use of HAART, the duration of HAART or protease inhibitor (PI) exposure. A review of the literature noted 129 VTE cases; mean age was 40 years, mean CD4 count was 181 cells/mm(3), the majority of patients were not receiving HAART, and the most common risk factor was an ongoing infection. Thrombotic events are occurring among patients with HIV despite their relatively young ages. Advanced HIV disease is a risk factor for development of thromboses, possibly due to an increased inflammatory state or the presence of concurrent comorbidities such as infections. HAART or PI therapy does not appear to play a significant role in the occurrence of VTEs."
3086,0.005,1.0000,"We assessed the seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection and incidence of toxoplasma encephalitis (TE) in 844 non-haemophiliac HIV-infected patients in Taiwan between June 1994 and April 2003. Approximately 70% (69.3%) of them had a baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count of 200 x 10(6)/L or less, and more than 70% (73.9%) having initiated highly active antiretroviral therapy. The seroprevalence of T. gondii infection was 10.2%, which did not differ with sex,age,route of transmission, birth inside or outside of Taiwan, or CD4+ lymphocyte stratifications. After a median observation duration of 603 days (range, 1-3264 days), 10 (1.2%) patients developed 11 episodes of TE after a median interval of 30 days (range, 1-941 days) between enrolment and diagnosis of TE, with an incidence of 0.59 per 100 person-years (PY) (95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.63 per 100 PY). We concluded that the incidence of TE of HIV-infected patients in Taiwan was lower than that reported in western countries because of a lower seroprevalence of T. gondii infection and use of antimicrobial prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy, although most of the patients were at the late stage of HIV infection."
2425,0.005,1.0000,"Appropriate supportive care and identification of long-term sequels of therapy are of paramount importance in HIV-infected pediatric patients. As low bone mineral quality (BMQ) in patients can be considered a marker of possible degeneration in osteopenia and osteoporosis in adulthood, we evaluated bone features in a pediatric population. Forty-four patients (23 females, 21 males; aged 3-17 years) were compared with a control population (1227 healthy children: 568 females, 641 males; aged 3-18 years). Seven patients were CDC stage C, 18 B, and 18 A. All patients were vertically infected; four were naive to any antiretroviral treatment, seven were taking two NRTIs, and 32 were on HAART. BMQ was assessed by a quantitative ultrasound (QUS) technique. It measures the amplitude-dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS, m/sec) and the bone transmission time (BTT, microsec). QUS values were significantly lower in cases than in controls, even after adjustment for age and body size (AD-SoS: 1924.7 +/- 64.9 and BTT: 0.97 +/- 0.3 in controls; AD-SoS: 1879.7 +/- 57.2 and BTT: 0.80 +/- 0.32 in cases; p < or = 0.001). The associations of AD-SoS and BTT with gender, type of therapy, and CDC stages were not significant. AD-SoS and BTT were significantly associated with age (r = 0.59, p < 0.0001), skeletal age SDS (r = 0.46, p = 0.002), height (r = 0.66, p < 0.0001), and therapy duration (r = 0.31, p = 0.04). Both AD-SoS and BTT values in patients fell below mean values of controls. Follow-up of bone mineral density is important in patients to prevent long-term problems of skeletal status."
18690,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) in prostate cancer (PCa) patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This is a prospective cohort study of HIV patients undergoing RALP, comparing the demographics, tumor characteristics, complications, and short-term oncological outcomes of HIV-positive men to HIV-negative men using univariate (χ(2), Mann-Whitney test) and multivariable (logistic regression) analyses. From 2007 to 2010, 298 men underwent RALP, 8 of whom were known to be HIV positive. Preoperatively, all eight were taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and had undetectable viral loads (<50); mean CD4 count was 634 cells per mm(3). HIV-positive men were younger (54 versus 62 years, P=0.010) and less likely to be white (P=0.007). There were no significant differences between groups with respect to clinical staging, pathological and oncological outcomes or most complication rates. However, the prevalence of perioperative transfusions (P=0.031) and ileus (P=0.021) were higher in HIV-positive patients. HIV remained significantly associated with risk of transfusion after adjustment for age, race, Gleason sum and clinical T stage (P=0.002). After a median of 2.6 (range 0.03-19.2) months of follow-up, PSA remained undetectable in all eight HIV patients. These data suggest that RALP is safe for, and demonstrates short-term oncological efficacy in, HIV-positive patients with PCa."
17418,0.005,1.0000,"Recent reports suggest that a growing number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons show signs of persistent cognitive impairment even in the context of combination antiretroviral therapies (cART). The basis for this finding remains poorly understood as there are only a limited number of studies examining the relationship between CNS injury, measures of disease severity, and cognitive function in the setting of stable disease. This study examined the effects of HIV infection on cerebral white matter using quantitative morphometry of the midsagittal corpus callosum (CC) in 216 chronically infected participants from the multisite HIV Neuroimaging Consortium study currently receiving cART and 139 controls. All participants underwent MRI assessment, and HIV-infected subjects also underwent measures of cognitive function and disease severity. The midsagittal slice of the CC was quantified using two semi-automated procedures. Group comparisons were accomplished using ANOVA, and the relationship between CC morphometry and clinical covariates (current CD4, nadir CD4, plasma and CSF HIV RNA, duration of HIV infection, age, and ADC stage) was assessed using linear regression models. HIV-infected patients showed significant reductions in both the area and linear widths for several regions of the CC. Significant relationships were found with ADC stage and nadir CD4 cell count, but no other clinical variables. Despite effective treatment, significant and possibly irreversible structural loss of the white matter persists in the setting of chronic HIV disease. A history of advanced immune suppression is a strong predictor of this complication and suggests that antiretroviral intervention at earlier stages of infection may be warranted."
5727,0.005,1.0000,"During recent years significant progress has been made in the treatment of HIV-1, at least in part due to the availability of potent antiretroviral drugs. The goal of the current treatment strategies is to inhibit the viral replication as completely as possible by using a combination of 3 or more antiretroviral drugs. This Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) has radically changed the clinical outcome of HIV, leading to decreased mortality and morbidity, at least in developed countries. Additionally to the advent of new and potent drugs, demonstrations of the prognostic value of the CD4 cell count and the plasma viral load were of major importance in the development of therapeutic strategies. Especially the ability of viral load assays to assess accurately the true level of viral replication, led to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. HIV proved to be a highly dynamic infection even during the period of clinical latency. The initial enthusiasm that HAART could radically change the outcome of HIV was cooled off in face of the difficulties in real life associated with the complex treatment strategies. Besides long-term side effects and suboptimal drug potency, the emergence of resistant virus and the necessity of perfect therapy adherence are major concerns for obtaining a sustained control of viral replication. In this study we focused on HIV resistance, which remains one of the major threats for a sustained response to antiretroviral therapy. HIV proved to be able to develop resistance to all currently used antiretroviral drugs. The high replication rate of the virus together with the low fidelity of the viral reverse transcriptase, from the basis for the presence of enormous amounts of viral variants. Whenever viral replication is ongoing in the presence of antiretroviral drugs, these variants that escape the inhibitory effects of the drugs will be selected. Although the knowledge in the field of HIV resistance has expanded enormously, many issues need to be answered. Genotypic and phenotypic resistance patterns are evolving continuously, due to changes in the treatment strategies. Moreover the relation between drug resistance and therapy failure needs further investigation, in order to prove the relevance of performing resistance testing in the follow-up of HIV-infected patients. The wide availability of antiretroviral drugs has led to the transmission of resistant HIV. Infection with HIV resistant to one or more antiretroviral drugs has been observed to occur through the different transmission routes. In a first study we assessed the prevalence of genotypic resistance to antiretroviral drugs in Belgian antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients. We observed that HIV strains with resistance-related mutations to one or more classes of antiretroviral drugs are not uncommon in the Belgian naïve patients. Furthermore the inclusion of samples from patients visiting the Belgian hospitals for the first time in 1995, 1997 and 1998, showed that the overall prevalence of baseline genotypic resistance remains rather constant (26-30%). The increasing trend in genotypic baseline resistance to 3TC (2% to 6.3%) and PIs (4.4% to 9.9%) as well as the decrease in ZDV-resistance (13.3% to 5.4%), reflect the change in treatment strategies, and resistance to these drugs is most probably caused by transmission of variants with resistance mutations selected during therapy. The presence of NNRTI-related mutations (around 16%) is likely to reflect the occurrence of baseline polymorphisms, since NNRTI-related mutations can occur without a replication deficit for the virus. Moreover, despite the rather recent introduction of NNRTIs into the clinic from 1997 onwards, no clear trend in NNRTI baseline resistance over time is observed. The best current therapeutic strategy for HIV-infected patients is to start antiretroviral therapy with HAART in order to avoid the accumulation of resistance towards drugs in less suppressive regimens. In a second study, we showed that the start of HAART in antiretroviral-naive HIV-patients in daily clinical practice could prevent viral breakthrough for up to 44 months in 60% of patients (n = 25). Six of 10 patients with virologic failure developed resistance to the drugs included in their treatment regimens. In comparison to patients with a sustained virologic response, patients with virologic failure were in a later disease stage when starting therapy and showed lower PI drug-levels, what can be an indication of poor adherence. Despite a poor virologic response for some of them, a rise in CD4 cell count was observed for all patients during the study period. A large number of HIV-infected patients started treatment in the pre-HAART period. The use of NRTIs is mono- or bitherapy was not able to prevent the development of resistant virus. In a third study we studied the prevalence and characteristics of 2 patterns of multinucleoside resistance (MNR) in European patients (n = 755). In patients without NRTI-exposure or with exposure to only one NRTI, no MNR was observed. MNR was present in low prevalence (each pattern < 2%) in patients pretreated with multiple NRTIs. Despite this low prevalence, MNR should be closely monitored, since it results in broad cross-resistance to NRTIs in vitro and a poor therapy response in vivo. We also assessed the predictive value of baseline resistance on the virologic response to later added drugs. The genotype of patients starting or changing a therapy consisting solely of NRTIs was analyzed at baseline and 6 months later. In patients without genotypic mutations towards the added drug the virologic response was significantly better compared to patients with baseline resistance. At 6 months however, both patient groups showed a rise in viral load due to the accumulation of NRTI-related mutations under the presence of poorly suppressive regimens, although the difference between the two groups remained significant. In this study, and also in studies reported by others, the presence of baseline resistance has a high predictive value for therapy failure, while the absence of resistance is not predictive for therapy response. Suboptimal adherence may be one of the reasons of the poor predictive value of the absence of baseline resistance for a good therapy response. In a last observational study, we investigated the relation between adherence, the presence and development of genotypic resistance and the virologic response in patients during HAART therapy. Adherence to 1 protease inhibitor was monitored using Electronic Event Monitoring. Patients with perfect therapy adherence and in particular without drug holidays, can control viral replication provided that the activity of the drugs included in the combination is not entirely compromised by the presence of baseline resistance mutations. In our patient population, reduced adherence resulted in therapy failure, mostly associated with a subsequent accumulation of resistance mutations. In conclusion, the outcome of the HIV disease has been revolutionarily changed with the advent of HAART. Both resistance and treatment adherence are crucial factors in determining the therapy response. Retrospective studies, such as ours, and a limited number of prospective trials already proved the short-term benefit of therapy switch based on the results of resistance tests in addition to standard of care. To ultimately define the role of tools as resistance testing and adherence monitoring with eventual adherence interventions, more prospective trials are needed as well in treatment-naïve as in experienced patients."
11736,0.005,1.0000,"In a national prospective study of risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 316 children of HIV-positive mothers were followed up for at least 6 months. Infection status was determined in 254 of them and 46 were found to be infected giving a transmission rate of 18.1%. Univariate analysis of potential risk factors for mother-to-child transmission showed an association between primiparity and increased transmission rate: odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-4.6, P < 0.05. Analysis by logistic regression confirmed this association (adjusted odds ratio 2.4) and showed, in addition, a negative association between transmission rate and elective Caesarean section (adjusted odds ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.97, P < 0.05). The effect of primiparity was less pronounced in combination with elective Caesarean section (odds ratio 1.7) than with other delivery modes (odds ratio 2.5, difference not significant). HIV-infected children were less likely to experience the birth of a younger sibling during the observation period than their uninfected counterparts (2 of 46 vs 27 of 208, P < 0.05 by logrank test)."
1453,0.005,1.0000,"In the past decade, broadened therapeutic options of oral direct antiviral agents for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection include: Lamivudine, Adefovir Dipivoxil, Telbivudine, Entecavir and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate. These direct oral antiviral agents effectively suppress the replication of the virus and reduce the risk of potential liver-related complications. However, prolonged use of these nucleos(t)ide analogues has been associated with drug resistance that compromises the initial clinical benefits. Moreover, the oncogenic risk of mutations due to prolonged nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy needs to be further investigated by in vitro and in vivo studies. In the current era of potent nucleotide analogues, new data are emerging, we are still facing the pool of patients who have developed resistance to the prior generation of nucleos(t)ide analogues. This paper aims to focus on incidence of antiviral drug resistance and virological breakthrough, prudent selection of initial therapy, on-treatment monitoring for drug resistance and revise treatment strategies for patients with resistant virus."
4070,0.005,1.0000,"Although HBV has the potential to generate an almost limitless spectrum of quasispecies during chronic infection, the viability of the majority of these quasispecies is almost certainly impaired due to constraints imposed by the remarkably compact organization of the HBV genome. On the other hand, single mutations may affect more than one gene and result in complex and unpredictable effects on viral phenotype. Better understanding of the constraints imposed by gene overlap and of genotype-phenotype relationships should help in the development of improved antiviral strategies and management approaches. Although the probability of developing viral resistance is directly proportional to the intensity of selection pressure and the diversity of quasispecies, potent inhibition of HBV replication should be able to prevent development of drug resistance because mutagenesis is replication dependent. If viral replication can be suppressed for a sufficient length of time, viral load should decline to a point where the continued production of quasispecies with the potential to resist new drug treatments no longer occurs. Clinical application of this concept will require optimization of combination therapies analogous to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV infection. Total cure of hepatitis B will require elimination of the intranuclear pool of viral minichromosomes, which will probably only be achieved by normal cell turnover, reactivation of host immunity, or elucidation of the antiviral mechanisms operating during cytokine clearance in acute hepatitis B (see Fig. 1)."
18677,0.005,1.0000,"The critical events in clearance or persistence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are unknown but likely to be determined early in acute infection. Type 1 and type 2 cytokine production was assessed by HCV peptide ELISpot and multiplex in vitro cytokine production assays in longitudinally collected samples from 20 untreated participants enrolled in the Australian Trial in Acute Hepatitis C (ATAHC); a prospective cohort of acute HCV infection (77% injecting drug users, IDU). Significantly higher interleukin-10 (IL-10) production (P = 0.048), in the relative absence of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and IL-2 production, was present early in HCV infection in those who progressed to chronic infection. In contrast, viral clearance was associated with a greater magnitude and broader specificity of IFN-γ (magnitude P < 0.001, breadth P = 0.004) and IL-2 responses, in the relative absence of IL-10. Early IL-10 production was correlated with higher HCV RNA level at baseline (P = 0.046) and week 12 (P = 0.018), while IFN-γ and IL-2 production was inversely correlated with HCV RNA level at baseline (IFN-γ P = 0.020, IL-2 P = 0.050) and week 48 (IFN-γ P = 0.045, IL-2 P = 0.026). Intracellular staining (ICS) indicated the HCV-specific IFN-γ response was primarily from CD8(+) T cells and NK cells, whereas IL-10 production was predominantly from monocytes, with a subset of IL-10 producing CD8(+) T cells present only in those who progressed to chronic infection. IL-10, an immunoregulatory cytokine, appears to play a key role in progression to chronic HCV infection."
18551,0.005,1.0000,"The substantial virus lysis was induced by HIV-1-infected patient serum and normal human complement serum in the presence of purified patient IgG. Non-infected CD4+ T cells coated with the whole virus or with a recombinant HIV-1 envelope gp120 and sensitised with patient IgG were also shown to be susceptible to complement-dependent lysis. The serum level of complement regulatory protein in a fluid phase, the C1-esterase inhibitor, was significantly correlated with serum concentration of C1q-circulating immune complexes (P=0.0062), but inversely with CD4+ T cell count (P < 0.0001). Accordingly, the disease progression in HIV-1-infected patients was significantly correlated with the level of complement activation as determined by serum level of C1-esterase inhibitor (P=0.0001), and inversely correlated with CD4+ cell count (P < 0. 0001) and gp120-specific antibody titre (P=0.0086). These results strongly suggest that the complement activation by gp120-specific antibodies play a very important role in virus clearance, but also in depletion of infected as well as gp120-coated non-infected CD4+ bystander T cells during the course of HIV-1 infection."
6880,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of toll-like receptors (TLR) 9 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with chronic hepatitis B and C with different virus copies. The study group included 90 patients (60 with chronic hepatitis B, and 30 with chronic hepatitis C), and 20 healthy people served as control group. The protein and mRNA levels of TLR9 were detected by using flow cytometry and real-time PCR. The serum viral copies of HBV and HCV were measured in all patients, and the correlation between HBV-DNA copies or HCV-RNA copies and the TLR9 expression was analyzed. Our results demonstrated that HBV or HCV infection led to a decreased expression of TLR9 mRNA and protein compared to the control group (P<0.05). The TLR9 protein and mRNA levels were negatively correlated with serum viral copies of HBV and HCV (r=-0.632, r=-0.909, P<0.01). It was concluded that TLR9 mRNA and protein are down-regulated in PBMC of HBV-infected or HCV-infected patients, and they are negatively correlated with serum viral copies and play an important role in detecting viral replication of HBV and HCV."
2378,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common in dialysis patients worldwide and nosocomial HCV spread within dialysis facilities continues to develop. Combination therapy with daclatasvir and asunaprevir (DCV/ASV) that has proven efficacy for dialysis patients infected with genotype 1b HCV (HCV/1b) has several concerns in Japan. The recently available combination therapy with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir (OBV/PTV/r) is not contraindicated in patients with chronic renal failure and has more safety profile and shorter treatment period than that with DCV/ASV. We evaluated the effects of combination therapy with OBV/PTV/r in four dialysis patients infected with HCV/1b, who were eligible for our study. On-treatment assessments included standard laboratory testing, serum HCV RNA and symptom-directed physical examinations. Three patients had a sustained virological response at 12 weeks after treatment, but one remaining patient had viral breakthrough. Notably, the patient with viral breakthrough had been coinfected with HCV/1b and HCV/2b; namely, HCV/2b with resistance-associated variations was not eradicated by the combination therapy. Among the three patients responsive to the combination therapy, one patient complained of appetite loss and itching, while in another patient the therapy was discontinued due to itching, exacerbation of wamble, and a falling tendency probably due to interaction with valsartan. These AEs were ameliorated or disappeared after the completion of the therapy. The significance of our study is persuasive virological evaluation associated to the combination therapy and reasonable interpretation of AEs. In conclusion, combination therapy with OBV/PTV/r may have promise as an efficacious therapy, but caution regarding AEs should be practiced."
425,0.005,1.0000,"The factors leading to spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) or to viral persistence are elusive. Understanding virus-host interactions that enable acute HCV clearance is key to the development of more effective therapeutic and prophylactic strategies. Here, using a sensitive neutralization assay based on infectious HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp), we have studied the kinetics of humoral responses in a cohort of acute-phase patients infected during a single nosocomial outbreak in a hemodialysis center. The 17 patients were monitored for the spontaneous outcome of HCV infection for 6 months before a treatment decision was made. Blood samples were taken frequently (15 +/- 4 per patient). Phylogenetic analysis of the predominant virus(es) revealed infection by only one of two genotype 1b strains. While all patients seroconverted, their sera induced two opposing effects in HCVpp infection assays: inhibition and facilitation. Furthermore, the ability of sera to facilitate or inhibit infection correlated with the presence of either infecting HCV strain and divided the patients into two groups. In group 1, the progressive emergence of a relatively strong neutralizing response correlated with a fluctuating decrease in high initial viremia, leading to control of viral replication. Patients in group 2 failed to reduce viremia within the acute phase, and no neutralizing responses were detected despite seroconversion. Strikingly, sera of group 2, as well as naive sera, facilitated infection by HCVpp displaying HCV glycoproteins from different genotypes and strains, including those retrieved from patients. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of viral persistence and immune control of viremia."
8723,0.005,1.0000,"T-cell immunoregulatory cytokines influence the persistence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronic infection and the extent of liver damage. Th1 cytokines positively correlate with hepatic inflammation in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The pro-inflammatory, cytokines IL-6 and IL-18, are involved in viral clearance and in metabolic and viral hepatic diseases, respectively. The aim of this study was to evaluate the profile of Th1/Th2 cytokines in HCV and HBV hepatitis. HBV-infected patients showed higher plasma IFN-gamma levels than the HCV+ patients or the control group (p <0.0001). Plasma TNF-alpha and IL-2 were higher in HBV+ in comparison to HCV+ patients (p <0.001) or the control group (p <0.005). Plasma IL-6 and IL-18 were higher in both groups of patients compared to the control group (p <0.04). In HCV+ and HBV+ groups, IL-6 was positively correlated with the duration of the illness (p <0.01 and <0.001, respectively) and viral load (p <0.001 and <0.001, respectively), while IL-18 was positively correlated with serum ALT activity (p <0.01 and <0.001, respectively) and serum AST activity (p <0.01 and <0.001, respectively). We found that in HCV+ and HBV+ patients there are higher levels of Th1 cytokines, particularly in the course of chronic hepatitis B, and that IL-18 and IL-6 levels may have important roles as markers of both inflammation and hepatic injury, particularly in the course of hepatitis C."
13871,0.005,1.0000,"Genetic polymorphisms of the interleukin 28B (IL28B) locus are associated closely with outcomes of pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between IL28B polymorphism and responses to therapy in patients infected with genotype 2. One hundred twenty-nine chronic hepatitis C patients infected with genotype 2, 77 patients with genotype 2a and 52 patients with genotype 2b, were analyzed. Clinical and laboratory parameters, including genetic variation near the IL28B gene (rs8099917), were assessed. Drug adherence was monitored in each patient. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses of these parameters and clinical responses were carried out. Univariate analyses showed that a sustained virological response was correlated significantly with IL28B polymorphism, as well as age, white blood cell and neutrophil counts, adherence to RBV, and rapid virological response. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients infected with genotype 2b achieved significantly lower rapid virological response rates than those with genotype 2a. Patients with the IL28B-major allele showed higher virus clearance rates at each time point than those with the IL28B-minor allele, and the differences were more profound in patients infected with genotype 2b than those with genotype 2a. Furthermore, both rapid and sustained virological responses were associated significantly with IL28B alleles in patients with genotype 2b. IL28B polymorphism was predictive of PEG-IFN plus RBV combination treatment outcomes in patients infected with genotype 2 and, especially, with genotype 2b. In conclusion, IL-28B polymorphism affects responses to PEG-IFN-based treatment in difficult-to-treat HCV patients."
2780,0.005,1.0000,"CD8(+)-T-cell responses play an important role in the containment and clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and an association between viral persistence and development of viral escape mutations has been postulated. While escape from CD8+ -T-cell responses has been identified as a major driving force for the evolution of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a broader characterization of this relationship is needed in HCV infection. To determine the extent, kinetics, and driving forces of HCV sequence evolution, we sequenced the entire HCV genome longitudinally in four subjects monitored for up to 30 months after acute infection. For two subjects the transmission sources were also available. Of 53 total non-envelope amino acid substitutions detected, a majority represented forward mutations away from the consensus sequence. In contrast to studies in HIV and SIV, however, only 11% of these were associated with detectable CD8+ T-cell responses. Interestingly, 19% of non-envelope mutations represented changes toward the consensus sequence, suggesting reversion in the absence of immune pressure upon transmission. Notably, the rate of evolution of forward and reverse mutations correlated with the conservation of each residue, which is indicative of structural constraints influencing the kinetics of viral evolution. Finally, the rate of sequence evolution was observed to decline over the course of infection, possibly reflective of diminishing selection pressure by dysfunctional CD8+ T cells. Taken together, these data provide insight into the extent to which HCV is capable of evading early CD8+ T-cell responses and support the hypothesis that dysfunction of CD8+ T cells may be associated with failure to resolve HCV infections."
10528,0.005,1.0000,"Inner-city adolescents are believed to be at increased risk for HIV infection because of their high-risk behaviors, and black and Hispanic teenagers may be at greatest risk as a consequence of these behaviors and inadequate AIDS education. In the present paper, the HIV risk status of pregnant Hispanic adolescents presenting for prenatal care to an inner-city municipal outpatient clinic located in New York City was assessed. The assessment consisted of a confidential structured interview. Based on known adult risk factors, adolescents were identified as being at increased risk or low risk. One-third of the 87 teenagers were identified as being at increased risk for HIV infection. Nobody reported symptoms suggestive of AIDS, had had a transfusion, or reported use of intravenous drugs or crack cocaine. Sexual risk-taking behavior was the most common factor that increased HIV risk. Sixteen adolescents were at increased risk solely because of a sexually transmitted disease and seven others reported an STD with at least one other risk factor. Although 86% of the pregnant teenagers reported the risk-taking behavior of substance use by self or partner, only four were at increased risk based on this factor alone. However, many adolescents were unaware of their partners' past substance use and sexual history and, therefore, may have underestimated their own risk. Birthplace (United States vs. foreign born) and nationality (Puerto Rican vs. non-Puerto Rican Hispanic) were significantly associated with the adolescents' HIV risk assessment via an interaction effect. None of the adolescents had previously considered themselves to be at increased risk for HIV infection. The overwhelming majority who were at increased risk declined referral for further counseling or testing. It is recommended that pregnant Hispanic adolescents be assessed for HIV risk and receive risk reduction counseling as part of their general health care."
3029,0.005,1.0000,"This study sought to determine the effects of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) on health literacy, which encompasses the ability to access, understand, appraise, and apply health-related information. Participants included 56 HIV seropositive individuals, 24 of whom met Frascati criteria for HAND, and 24 seronegative subjects who were comparable on age, education, ethnicity, and oral word reading. Each participant was administered a brief battery of well-validated measures of health literacy, including the Expanded Numeracy Scale (ENS), Newest Vital Sign (NVS), Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), and Brief Health Literacy Screen (BHLS). Results revealed significant omnibus differences on the ENS and NVS, which were driven by poorer performance in the HAND group. There were no significant differences on the REALM or the BHLS by HAND status. Among individuals with HAND, lower scores on the NVS were associated with greater severity of neurocognitive dysfunction (e.g., working memory and verbal fluency) and self-reported dependence in activities of daily living. These preliminary findings suggest that HAND hinders both fundamental (i.e., basic knowledge, such as numeracy) and critical (i.e., comprehension and application of healthcare information) health literacy capacities, and therefore may be an important factor in the prevalence of health illiteracy. Health literacy-focused intervention may play an important role in the treatment and health trajectories among persons living with HIV infection."

A cross-section study was performed in 495 individuals treated at a public center in the city of Goiânia. Participants were interviewed and blood collected for evaluation of serological and molecular markers for HBV and HCV. The rate of exposure to HBV was 33.5% (95% CI 29.4-37.9). Nineteen patients (3.8%) were diagnosed as HBV carriers, of whom 68.4% were HBV DNA positive. The prevalence of anti-HCV was 9.7% (95% CI 7.3-12.7). Genotype 1a was identified in 72.7% of the PCR samples positive for HCV. Co-infection by all three viruses was 4.4% (95% CI 2.9-6.8). Being, male, aged ≥40 years, history of sexually transmitted disease (STD), and having homosexual practices were independently associated with the presence of markers of HBV exposure. A history of injectable drugs use and STDs showed association with HCV seropositivity. Approximately 50% of participants were not aware of their HBV and HCV serostatus. The results obtained may contribute to assess the burden of viral hepatitis in people living with HIV and to guiding preventive measures for more vulnerable groups. "
7506,0.005,1.0000,"Although HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection has been recognized worldwide in individuals exposed to blood-borne and sexually transmitted diseases (STD), limited data are available on the epidemiology of this coinfection in Brazil. A cross-sectional study was carried out to estimate the prevalence of HCV seropositivity in a cohort of people living with HIV/AIDS in Santos, Brazil, and to investigate potential risk factors for HCV infection. Anti-HCV antibodies were sought by using two immunoenzymatic assays. Overall HCV seroprevalence was 36.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31.9-40.4%). However, it was significantly higher (84.8%, 95% CI 78.2-91.3%) among intravenous drug users (IDU) as compared to non-IDU (20.9%, 95% CI 16.8-25.1%) (p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that HCV seropositivity among IDU was independently associated with needle sharing (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] = 4.28, p = 0.07) and with serologic evidence of exposure to other bloodborne agents: HBV (adjOR = 4.39, p = 0.01) and HTLV-I/II (adjOR = 6.43, p = 0.02). In contrast, no association with lifetime number of sexual partners, history of STD, or of sex with commercial sex workers (CSW) could be demonstrated. Among non-IDU, HCV seropositivity was independently associated with sexual partnership with IDU (adjOR = 2.15, p = 0.08) and with HBV seropositivity (adjOR = 1.71, p = 0.05), but not with engaging in oral or anal receptive intercourse or having sex with CSW. Results indicate that exposure to blood and sexual partnership with IDU constitute the main risk factors for HCV acquisition among HIV-positive patients in Santos, Brazil. Prevention of HCV spread in this population should thus include harm reduction measures and information on safer sex practices for both IDU and their sexual partners."
392,0.005,1.0000,"In order to estimate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection in hard-to-reach intravenous drug users, 199 subjects from high-risk inner-city locales, the so called ""shooting galleries"", were consented, interviewed, and tested in Miami, FL, US. Positive HIV-1 status was based on repeatedly reactive ELISA and confirmatory Western Blot. Positive HCV status was based on reactive ELISA and confirmatory polymerase chain reaction techniques. Overall, 50 (25%) were not infected with either virus, 61 (31%) were HIV-1/HCV co-infected, 17 (8%) infected by HIV-1 only, and 71 (36%) infected by HCV only. The results of the multivariable analyses showed that more years using heroin was the only significant risk factor for HCV only infection (odds ratio = 1.15; 95% confidence interval = 1.07, 1.24) and for HIV-1/HCV co-infection (odds ratio = 1.17; 95% confidence interval = 1.09, 1.26). This paper demonstrates that HIV-1/HCV co-infection is highly prevalent among so called ""shooting galleries""."

Hepatitis C has been pointed out as a remarkable factor for that. More recently, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has also been found to play a role on liver disease in this population. HIV-HBV co-infection prevalence remains largely unknown in vast areas of Brazil. The objective of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of HBV and HDV infection in HIV-infected subjects living in the state of Mato Grosso, in the Central region of Brazil, and compare it to other Brazilian studies. We also assess epidemiologic data regarding risk factors and vaccinal status."

Rotterdam, a city in The Netherlands harbors a large group of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients of which most are born abroad. The study included 464 consecutive CHB patients who were reported to the Municipal Public Health Service in Rotterdam from January 1, 2002 to September 15, 2005. The HBV genotypes, possible transmission routes of infection and travel history of CHB patients born in The Netherlands, were compared with those CHB patients living in The Netherlands but who were foreign-born, taking into account the ethnicity of the mother. Of the 464 patients with CHB infection, 14% were Dutch-born and 86% were foreign-born. The CHB patients in the Dutch-born group had genotypes A (35%), B (15%), C (11%), D (37%), and G (2%). In the foreign-born group, the distribution of genotypes was A (20%), B (15%), C (11%), D (40%), and E (15%). In the Dutch-born group, sexual transmission accounted for a larger proportion of infections (P < 0.0001) compared to the foreign-born group, whereas perinatal transmission is reported to be higher in the foreign-born group and in the Dutch-born group with a foreign mother. The genotypes of the chronic HBV strains determined corresponded well with the HBV genotypes expected from the countries of origin of the patients or their mothers. Genotypes A and D are predominant in CHB patients in The Netherlands."

Cross-matched New York City (NYC) TB and viral hepatitis surveillance data were used to estimate the proportion of NYC adults diagnosed with TB from 2000 to 2010 with a report of viral hepatitis infection and to describe the impact of viral hepatitis infection on TB treatment completion and death. For 9512 TB patients, HCV infection was reported in 4.2% and HBV infection in 3.7%; <1% of TB patients had both HCV and HBV infection. The proportion of TB patients with HCV infection to die before TB treatment completion was larger than in TB patients without a viral hepatitis report (21% vs. 9%); this association remained when stratified by HIV status. There was no significant difference in death before treatment completion for TB patients with HBV infection compared to TB patients without a viral hepatitis report when stratified by HIV status. These findings reinforce the importance of hepatitis testing and providing additional support to TB patients with viral hepatitis infection."
11085,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the natural killer (NK) cell phenotype and function in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients and to study the effects of entecavir therapy (10 mg/day, p.o.) on these responses. Peripheral blood NK cells were collected from 18 chronic HBV patients and 14 healthy controls. The effect of entecavir therapy on the phenotype and function of NK cells in chronic HBV patients was characterized by flow cytometry analysis. Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), HBV viral loads in both groups and potential associations between the frequency of peripheral NK cell subsets and clinical measures were determined. There was a significant reduction in the number of CD3(-)CD56(+) NK cells in chronic HBV patients compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, there were significant increases in the percentage of CD3(-)CD56(+)NKG2D(+) and CD3(-)CD56(+)NKP30(+) NK activating receptors in chronic HBV patients compared with healthy individuals, who exhibited downregulated expression following entecavir treatment. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed that there was a significant positive correlation between the percentage of NKG2D(+) and NKP30(+) NK cells and serum ALT levels. Characterization of NK cell degranulation indicated that the frequency of CD107a(+) NK cells in HBV patients (in response to K562 stimulation) was significantly greater than in healthy controls but decreased following entecavir treatment. Entecavir treatment of hepatitis B e antigen-positive chronic HBV-infected patients not only led to a reduction in HBV DNA loads and normalization of ALT and AST levels, but also resulted in the recovery of NK cell-mediated immunity."
3745,0.005,1.0000,"Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remain a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality despite the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) especially in the resource-limited regions of the world. Diagnosis of these infections may be challenging because findings on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and brain imaging are nonspecific. While brain biopsy provides a definitive diagnosis, it is an invasive procedure associated with a relatively low mortality rate, thus less invasive modalities have been studied in recent years. Diagnosis, therefore, can be established based on a combination of a compatible clinical syndrome, radiologic and CSF findings, and understanding of the role of HIV in these infections. The most common CNS opportunistic infections are AIDS-defining conditions; thus, treatment of these infections in combination with HAART has greatly improved survival. "
18574,0.005,1.0000,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is caused by the JC polyomavirus (JCV) and is one of the most feared complications of HIV-1 infection. Unlike other opportunistic infections, this disease can present when CD4 counts are higher than those associated with AIDS and when patients are receiving combined antiretroviral therapy, either shortly after starting or, more rarely, during long term successful treatment. Clinical suspicion of the disease is typically when MRI shows focal neurological deficits and associated demyelinating lesions; however, the identification of JCV in cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissue is needed for a definitive diagnosis. Although no specific treatment exists, the reversal of immunosuppression by combined antiretroviral therapy leads to clinical and MRI stabilisation in 50-60% of patients with the disease, and JCV clearance from cerebrospinal fluid. A substantial proportion of patients treated with combined antiretroviral therapy develop inflammatory lesions, which can be associated with either a favourable outcome or clinical worsening. The reasons for variability in the natural history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and treatment responses are largely undefined, and more specific and rational approaches to management are needed."
11593,0.005,1.0000,"Natural killer (NK) cells are a major component of the host innate immune defence against various pathogens. Several viruses, including Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), have developed strategies to evade the NK-cell response. This study was designed to evaluate whether HIV-1 could interfere with the expression of NK cell-activating ligands, specifically the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I-like MICA and ULBP molecules that bind NKG2D, an activating receptor expressed by all NK cells. Results show that the HIV-1 Nef protein downmodulates cell-surface expression of MICA, ULBP1 and ULBP2, with a stronger effect on the latter molecule. The activity on MICA and ULBP2 is well conserved in Nef protein variants derived from HIV-1-infected patients. In HIV-1-infected cells, cell-surface expression of NKG2D ligands increased to a higher extent with a Nef-deficient virus compared with wild-type virus. Mutational analysis of Nef showed that NKG2D ligand downmodulation has structural requirements that differ from those of other reported Nef activities, including HLA-I downmodulation. Finally, data demonstrate that Nef expression has functional consequences on NK-cell recognition, causing a decreased susceptibility to NK cell-mediated lysis. These findings provide a novel insight into the mechanisms evolved by HIV-1 to escape from the NK-cell response."
1027,0.005,1.0000,"We have identified a subset of CD56(+)CD3(-) human natural killer (NK) cells that express CD4 and the HIV coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4. These cells can be productively infected in vitro by both CCR5- and CXCR4-using molecular clones of HIV-1 in a CD4-dependent manner. Analysis of HIV-infected persons showed that viral DNA is present in purified NK cells, and virus could be rescued from these cells after in vitro cultivation. Longitudinal analysis of the HIV-1 DNA levels in NK cells from patients after 1-2 years of highly active antiretroviral therapy indicated that NK cells remain persistently infected and account for a substantial amount of the viral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results demonstrate that a subset of non-T cells with NK markers are persistently infected and suggest that HIV infection of NK cells is important for virus persistence. The properties of the virus reservoir in these cells should be considered in attempts to further optimize antiretroviral therapies."
6312,0.005,1.0000,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is associated with adrenal disorders, which must not be underestimated. Adrenal morphologic changes are primarily related to opportunistic infections, mostly by cytomegalovirus and mycobacteria, and malignant tumours such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. The most frequent biological alteration reported to date is the increases in cortisol concentrations which results from a decrease in cortisol metabolism and hyperactivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis commonly referred to as pseudo-Cushing's syndrome. These modifications can be a consequence of antiretroviral therapy and do not require any investigation or specific treatment. Conversely, adrenal insufficiency, either iatrogenic or secondary to glandular infiltration by neoplasms or infections, needs long-term substitution with hydrocortisone, but at present occurs more rarely and usually at late stages of disease progression. The impact of HIV infection on the other adrenocortical functions has been less reported in the literature although several studies show low levels of adrenal androgens, especially dehydroepiandrostenedione (DHEA). Impairment in mineralocorticoid function appears occasional and remains a subject of debate. "
16310,0.005,1.0000,"An HIV-1 p24 antigen test involving signal amplification-boosted ELISA of heat-denatured plasma was evaluated prospectively in 55 patients whose viral RNA in plasma had previously been suppressed for at least 6 months under antiretroviral combination therapy. During a median follow-up of 504 days, CD4 counts increased by a median of 62 cells per year. By univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis, the level of p24 antigen as expressed by the absorbance/cutoff ratio was a significant inverse correlate of both the CD4 count in a sample (p =.013) and its annual change in a patient (p <.0001). The p24 antigen retained significance even among 48 individuals whose HIV-1 RNA, apart from occasional blips, remained below 400 copies/mL. Batch-wise retesting of 70 samples from 5 such patients with a further improved procedure showed measurable p24 antigen in all but 1 sample and an inverse correlation with both the CD4 count (p =.0331) and percentage (p <.0001), thus confirming the prospectively generated data. Comparison of p24 antigen and HIV-1 RNA concentrations indicate that the p24 antigen detected in these samples is not associated with viral RNA-containing particles and may originate from other compartments of virus expression."

Twelve patients with major depression, as determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, were assessed in comparison with 15 matched nondepressed control subjects. Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets together with immunological parameters were performed. In HIV-infected patients, major depression was significantly (P=0.001) associated with a reduction in natural killer cell absolute count and percentage. This report suggests that depression may alter the natural killer cell population that provides a cytotoxic defense against HIV infection."

HBV DNA was detected in the sera of 22 of 43 (51.2%) patients with hemophilia who were negative for HBV surface antigen (HBs), indicating that these patients had occult HBV infection. No factor, including age, type or severity of hemophilia, presence of HBs or HBV core (HBc) antibody, or coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was associated with occult HBV infection, except for high anti-HBc titer and/or coinfection with HCV genotype 1 (1a or 1b). In general, occult HBV infection did not appear to have significant clinical implications. However, in patients in whom HBV was detected by PCR specific for the surface (S)-region, higher alanine aminotransferase levels were observed. The genotype of the occult HBV in the present study was exclusively the domestic type indigenous to Japan (genotype C), suggesting a different route of transmission for HBV in comparison to HCV and HIV in this population."
17202,0.005,1.0000,"Although the association between TT virus (TTV) infection and hepatitis is controversial, the high prevalence of TTV infection in healthy blood donors and even higher rate among frequently transfused patients poses a potential threat to public health and clinical care. In addition, there is a lack of data concerning the prevalence and mode of transmission of TTV infection in different subpopulations in Taiwan. In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of TTV infection in 111 uremic patients receiving regular hemodialysis in a single hospital in Taiwan. Blood samples were collected and analyzed using a seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) designed to amplify a 271 base-pair DNA fragment. The results show that the overall TTV positive rate in uremic patients in our hospital was 61% (68/111), which was much higher than the reported TTV prevalence rate among the normal population (ranging from 1%-12%). The results of analysis of the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients indicate that blood transfusion may play an important role in TTV transmission (p < 0.05). In addition, the hepatitis B positive rate was significantly lower in TTV positive patients. However, liver function tests were not significantly different between TTV positive and TTV negative patients. The results of the present study suggest that blood transfusion plays an important role in TTV transmission in uremic patients."

9031,0.005,1.0000,"Human polyomavirus BK virus (BKV) is a double-stranded DNA virus that infects approximately 90 % of the general population as a subclinical or mild infection. In immunosuppressed patients, such as HIV cases, BKV may be reactivated resulting hemorrhagic cystitis and tubulointerstitial nephritis. However, there are limited studies on prevalence and molecular epidemiology of BKV in Iran. We therefore aimed to evaluate the prevalence and subtypes of BKV in Iranian HIV patients. A total of 99 patients with HIV infection were enrolled in the study. Presence of BKV DNA in plasma was evaluated by nested PCR. PCR products were sequenced directly, and phylogenetic analysis was performed. BKV DNA was detected in 8.08 % of HIV patients. BKV viremia presented in 4 out of 25 patients (16 %) not receiving antiretroviral therapy in comparison with 4 out 74 of HAART-treated patients (5.4 %) (P = 0.023). In patients with CD4 counts ≥200 cells/mm(3), viremia was found more commonly (7/80 = 8.8 %) than in those with lower counts (1/19 = 5.2 %) (not significant). All sequenced BKV isolates belonged to subtype Ib-2. Our findings indicated that the prevalence of BKV viremia is relatively prevalent in patients with HIV infection and significantly higher in naïve than HAART-treated cases. Therefore, HAART can eliminate BKV infection from plasma and reduce viremia although the actual implication of BKV viremia in HIV patients is not clear."
10555,0.005,1.0000,"In Portugal, the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) seropositivity is higher than in other European countries or North America. Recent literature data points out a possible difference on the pathogenic potential and on the natural history of HIV-1 and HIV-2, suggesting a lower virulence of HIV-2. Facing these hypothesis and the increasing number of HIV-2 cases, we analysed two infected groups HIV-1 and HIV-2, trying to correlate the ophthalmologic lesions present in both populations and searching for a difference in the clinical presentation of the ocular disorder. We studied prospectively 214 patients with HIV infection at several stages, 83% HIV-1 and 17% HIV-2. Ocular manifestations were present in both populations with a significant prevalence in HIV-1 (48%), compared to HIV-2 (19%) (p < 0.005). The ophthalmologic pathology found, particularly noninfectious retinopathy, infectious retinitis and neuro-ophthalmic disorders, were considered important for the disease's diagnosis and prognosis. All these ophthalmic findings were present in the HIV-1 population. In the HIV-2 group the most frequent lesion was noninfectious retinopathy. Within each group, HIV-1 and HIV-2, the comparison of the survival between AIDS patients with and without ocular lesions, revealed a significant shorter survival time in those with ocular pathology (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05). There seems to exist a certain analogy in clinical expression in both groups, although it is possible to admit a lower severity in ocular involvement in patients infected by HIV-2."

Patients were categorized into the following groups: inactive HBV carrier, active HBV carrier, HBV-cleared subject and cirrhosis+HCC. Samples were analysed for 10 SNPs in microRNAs using either PCR-based genotyping or the TaqMan assay. We found that rs1358379 was associated with susceptibility to HBV infection, HBV clearance, persistent chronic HBV infection and liver cirrhosis+HCC. In addition, we found that rs2292832 and rs11614913 were associated with risk of HBV infection, viral clearance and cirrhosis+HCC, whereas rs2910164 was associated with proneness to HBV infection, and ability to clear the virus. There was evidence of associations between rs6505162 and HBV clearance and the development of liver disease, whereas a single association was found between rs2289030 and HBV clearance. Similarly, rs7372209 and rs4919510 were specifically associated with the development of HBV-induced liver complications. SNPs in miRNAs affect the susceptibility, clearance and progression of HBV infection in Saudi Arabian patients. We found, using Gene Ontology or pathway analyses, that these genes may contribute to the pathophysiology of HBV infection and related liver complications. However, differences in the association of examined SNPs with various clinical stages indicate variations in the respective functional roles of these polymorphisms and their miRNAs, and thus, further investigation to fully explore their therapeutic potential is warranted."

HIV was cultured from 36 (17%) of 215 semen specimens from 56 seropositive men, and CMV was cultured from 42 (30%) of 139 specimens. In logistic regression models, the CD8+ cell count in peripheral blood was the best predictor of HIV shedding in semen. Shedding of HIV was more closely associated with concomitant shedding of CMV than with CD4+ cell count, and antiretroviral therapy had minimal influence on shedding of HIV. In contrast, CD4+ cell count was the best predictor of CMV shedding in semen. Factors that determine shedding of viruses in semen may differ substantially from those that influence virus levels in the systemic immune compartment. Likewise, immunologic factors that determine shedding of HIV appear to differ from those that control shedding of CMV in semen."
18938,0.005,1.0000,"Sexually transmitted infections may enhance the sexual transmission of HIV-1. It is possible that loss of virological control in patients with such infections receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) may even facilitate the transmission of drug-resistant HIV. We have recently demonstrated that in those on maximally suppressive ART this effect is reduced. We have examined the virus obtained from the blood plasma and seminal plasma of six HIV-1-infected men receiving poorly suppressive ART with acute urethritis for the presence of drug resistance-associated mutations. In four men with gonorrhoea the blood and seminal plasma HIV-1 had mutations conferring reduced susceptibility to one or more available drugs. In one of these men the viral load of drug-resistant virus in seminal plasma was 20-fold higher during gonorrhoea than following antibiotic treatment, with no change in blood plasma viral load. We conclude that in the presence of suboptimal ART, sexually transmitted infections may enhance the spread of drug-resistant HIV-1."
15044,0.005,1.0000,"Understanding the biology of spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection could lead to improved strategies to prevent the sequelae associated with chronic HCV infection. Chronic infections with hepatitis virus are very common in China, but the factors associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV have not been adequately studied. We evaluated the spontaneous clearance of HCV among 1918 drug users and 1526 HCV-seropositive blood donors in Guangzhou, China. Among participants who were co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), 41.38% of drug users and 39.47% of blood donors had cleared their HCV infection without antiviral therapy compared to 9.41% of drug users and 16.73% of blood donors who were mono-infected with a single virus (P<.01). The proportion of subjects who had cleared their HCV infection was significantly greater in the co-infected subjects whose serum HBV DNA was greater than 2000IU/mL than those with lower levels. A multiple logistic regression analysis found female gender, IL28B rs8099917 TT genotype, HBV co-infection and blood donors (vs drug users) associated with increased spontaneous clearance of HCV infection. Although acute HCV infections are common in China, the incidence of chronic HCV may be reduced among the high prevalence of chronic HBV and IL28B genotypes associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV in Chinese populations."

16736,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections were evaluated in chimpanzees that had previously cleared HCV and were rechallenged. Animals that had previously cleared HCV infection rapidly cleared homologous and heterologous virus upon rechallenge, indicative of a strong protective immunity. In one animal, sterilizing immunity was observed with regard to viremia, although viral RNA was transiently detected in the liver. Accelerated viral clearance following rechallenge with HCV was observed in animals that had not been exposed to HCV for over 16 years, suggesting that long-lasting protective immunity may be possible. The ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to recognize HCV proteins was evaluated during the course of the rechallenge experiments. A very early and strong in vitro recall response to HCV nonstructural proteins appeared to be associated with viral clearance. In contrast, proliferative responses to HCV proteins were not observed in 4 persistently infected chimpanzees, and a weak proliferative response was observed in 1 of 2 animals during acute resolving infection. The results suggest that a strong T-cell proliferative response is induced upon rechallenge of chimpanzees with HCV and that this response is associated with rapid viral clearance. The antibody response to HCV proteins increased by over 1,000-fold in all animals following rechallenge as well. A more complete understanding of the role of the cellular immune response in the clearance of HCV and the nature of the protective immune response following viral clearance may aid in the generation of therapies and vaccines."

Clean-catch midstream urine and venous blood was collected from 421 subjects comprising 317 HIV patients (89 men, 228 women) and 104 non-HIV subjects (48 men, 56 women). The HIV patients consisted of 101 highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-naive subjects and 216 patients on HAART for three to six months. The HIV patients were asymptomatic and all subjects had no signs or symptom of UTI. Microbial isolates were identified in urine and susceptibility tests were performed. Only HIV patients on HAART had significantly higher prevalence of asymptomatic UTI compared with non-HIV subjects (27.78% vs. 17.31%, OR = 1.8376, 95% confidence interval = 1.0198-3.3112, P = 0.0411). Among both groups, CD4+ count < 200 cells/microL was not associated with asymptomatic UTI. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common uropathogen (27.2%) and nitrofurantoin was the most active antibacterial agent. Most bacterial isolates were resistant to other antibacterial agents used (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, gentamicin, co-trimoxazole, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin). Overall prevalence of asymptomatic UTI was 24.94%. HIV patients on HAART had a one- to three-fold higher risk of acquiring UTI. CD4+ count was not associated with asymptomatic UTI."

HRSN had higher naive (CD45RO CD27) CD4 and CD8 T cell numbers and lower percentages of activated (HLADR CD38, CD70) CD4 and proliferating (Ki67) CD4 and CD8 T cells, irrespective of previous episodes of sexually transmittable infections. Furthermore, whole blood cultures from HRSN showed lower lymphoproliferative responses than healthy laboratory controls.

Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze risk factors for prevalent HAV and HBV infection. One thousand two hundred ninety-nine Thai men who have sex with men 18 years and older were enrolled. Among those with results, 349/1,291 (27.0%) had evidence of past or current hepatitis A infection. Of the 1,117 (86.5%) men with unambiguous HBV test results, 442 (39.6%) had serologic evidence of past/current infection, 103 (9.2%) were immune due to hepatitis B vaccination, 572 (51.2%) had no evidence of immunological exposure to HBV or vaccine. Of those with past/current HBV infection, 130 (29.4%) were HIV positive. Age >35 years was independently associated with both HAV and HBV infection. University education was protective against both HAV and HBV infection. Increased alcohol consumption, number of lifetime male sexual partners ≥10, and prevalent HIV infection were also independently associated with HBV infection. The prevalence of past/current HAV and HBV infection was high in Bangkok men who have sex with men.

Blood transfusion has been associated with accelerated disease progression and mortality in patients with HIV infection, and review of related literature suggests that the mechanism for negative transfusion-associated outcomes may be transfusion-related immunosuppression. Therefore, the use of transfusion should be restricted to patients with acute or severe anemia. Prescription of epoetin alfa has been associated with increased survival in an observational cohort among patients with HIV infection and anemia. In the absence of data from a clinical trial documenting the effect of treating anemia on survival, clinicians should consider non-transfusion options for management of anemia on the basis of clinical status and patient functional ability."

Our objective is to study the in vivo effect of the abacavir/lamivudine/efavirenz first-line HAART regimen on PAF metabolism in HIV-infected patients. The specific activities of PAF basic biosynthetic enzymes in leukocytes and platelets, PAF-cholinephosphotransferase  (PAF-CPT) and lyso-PAF-acetyltransferase (Lyso-PAF-AT), but also those of PAF-basic catabolic enzymes, PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) in leukocytes and platelets and Lipoprotein-associated-Phospholipase-A2 (LpPLA2) in plasma, were measured in blood samples of 10 asymptomatic naïve male HIV-infected patients just before and after 1, 3 and 6 months of treatment. CD4 cell counts, viral load and several biochemical markers were also measured in the same blood samples of these patients. The repeated ANOVA measures and the Pearson r criterion were used for studying statistical differences and correlations - partial correlations respectively. Even though viral load was decreased and CD4 cell counts were beneficially increased after treatment with the abacavir/lamivudine/efavirenz regimen, the main enzyme of the remodelling PAF-synthesis that is implicated in pro-atherogenic inflammatory procedures, Lyso-PAF-AT activity, was increased at 3 months of treatment in both leukocytes and platelets, while the main enzyme of PAF-degradation, PAF-AH, was increased as a response only in leukocytes at the 3rd month. Although the  abacavir/lamivudine/efavirenz HAART regimen exhibits very efficient antiretroviral activities, on the other hand it induces an in vivo transient increase in the inflammation-related remodeling PAF-biosynthetic pathway. This finding supports the hypothesis of inflammation-mediated increased cardiovascular risk in HIV-infected patients during the first months of abacavir-containing HAART."
15221,0.005,1.0000,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are a clear threat for public health, with high prevalences especially in high risk groups such as injecting drug users. People with HIV infection who are also infected by HCV suffer from a more rapid progression to HCV-related liver disease and have an increased risk for cirrhosis and liver cancer. Quantifying the impact of HIV and HCV co-infection is therefore of great importance. We propose a new joint mathematical model accounting for co-infection with the two viruses in the context of injecting drug users (IDUs). Statistical concepts and methods are used to assess the model from a statistical perspective, in order to get further insights in: (i) the comparison and selection of optional model components, (ii) the unknown values of the numerous model parameters, (iii) the parameters to which the model is most 'sensitive' and (iv) the combinations or patterns of values in the high-dimensional parameter space which are most supported by the data. Data from a longitudinal study of heroin users in Italy are used to illustrate the application of the proposed joint model and its statistical assessment. The parameters associated with contact rates (sharing syringes) and the transmission rates per syringe-sharing event are shown to play a major role."
17552,0.005,1.0000,"Mutual activation of reproduction of type 1 HIV and herpes simplex types 1 and 2 viruses (HSV) was observed in simultaneous infection of continuous T-cellular lymphoblastoid lines (CEM, 119, Hut-78, MT-4, Jurkat-tat) and U-937 monocytic line. Syncytium formation and cytodestructive pattern of reproduction of viruses of both families in these cell lines necessitated the use of enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect the antigens of these viruses in order to assess the level of reproduction. The concentration of HIV antigens in EIA increased in mixed infection by 1.4 to 2.1 times in different cultures in comparison with the culture infected with HIV-1 alone, and concentrations of HSV-1 and HSV-2 increased by 1.3-1.8 times in mixed infection, in comparison with reproduction in lymphoblastoid cultures infected with HSV alone. EIA was alone used to examine the production of IgG and IgM antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus, another representative of Herpesviridae family, in the blood sera of patients with immunodeficiency states in whose sera antibodies to proteins produced by gag HIV gene (p15/17, p24, p55) were detected. Increased concentration of IgG antibodies were revealed in 36% of these patients, whereas in healthy donors the sera with elevated concentrations of IgG to Epstein-Barr virus were far less incident (12%). A hypothesis about mutual activation of HIV and herpes viruses is put forward."
12799,0.005,1.0000,"Transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 polymorphism has been associated with metabolic disturbance and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and potential disturbances on the lipid profile in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients. We performed a cross-sectional study on 263 HIV/HVC-coinfected patients. TCF7L2 polymorphism was genotyped by GoldenGate assay. The analysis was performed by linear and logistic regression under a dominant model of inheritance. The variables analyzed were total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), non-HDL-C, and triglycerides. Patients harboring the rs7903146 TT/TC genotype showed a diminished concentration of TC (p=0.003), LDL-C (p=0.004), HDL-C (p=0.012), and non-HDL-C (p=0.013), a lower percentage of TC≥200 mg/dl (p=0.038), and a higher percentage of HDL≤40 mg/dl (p=0.023). In addition, we observed that rs7903146 was differently related to fasting serum lipid levels according to the HCV-genotype (HCV-GT). With regard to HCV-GT1 patients, the rs7903146 TT/TC genotype was associated with lower levels of HDL-C [adjusted arithmetic mean ratio (aAMR)=0.91; p=0.049] and an elevated percentage of patients with HDL-C≤40 mg/dl [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=3.26; p=0.003]. For HCV-GT3 patients, the rs7903146 TT/TC genotype was associated with lower serum values of TC (aAMR=0.81; p=0.037), LDL-C (aAMR=0.67; p=0.001), and non-HDL-C (aAMR=0.75; p=0.002) and a reduced percentage of TC≥200 mg/dl (aOR=0.089; p=0.037). In conclusion, the TCF7L2 rs7903146 TT/TC genotype was associated with lower levels of TC, LDL, and HDL in HCV-GT3 patients, and lower levels of HDL-C in HCV-GT1 patients, suggesting a role in cardiovascular disease and a potential use as a biomarker in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients.

19526,0.005,1.0000,"The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality, thus increasing life expectancy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, transforming HIV into a chronic disease. Accordingly, there has been an increase in the number of comorbidities concomitantly present in these individuals and also an increased use of comedications, which may negatively impact antiretroviral therapy adherence. These factors can affect adherence to antiretroviral therapy. The role of the HIV clinical pharmacist is essential to achieve therapeutic objectives and enhance adherence."

253,0.005,1.0000,"The global incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has decreased by 15% over the past years, but is still too high. Despite current programs to reduce the incidence of HIV infection, further approaches are needed to limit this epidemic. Oral antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is currently one of the most discussed possible prevention methods. This literature study demonstrates whether orally antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis in HIV-uninfected individuals with high-risk behaviour reduces the transmission of HIV. We used the PICO method and conducted a search to identify relevant studies. Subjects of the study were HIV-uninfected individuals with high-risk behaviour. Intervention was oral PrEP with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) alone or plus emtricitabine (FTC) versus placebo. The primary outcome was the HIV incidence among this high-risk group. Secondary outcomes were adherence to PrEP, frequency and type of adverse effects. We identified ten studies from which five randomised control trials (RCTs) were included after screening. The results from three out of five trials showed a reduction, but two trials showed no protection in acquiring HIV infection. There were no significant differences in adverse events. The adherence was different among different groups and affected the outcome of the studies. In conclusion, this prophylaxis might offer protection when used in combination with intense monitoring and guidance in uninfected individuals with a high risk of HIV acquisition. However, there are still many unresolved questions. Drug adherence seems to be a crucial factor in the effectiveness of PrEP. Therefore, individual risk behaviour remains an important determinant for success in the prevention of HIV transmission. "
3148,0.005,1.0000,"Dental care of HIV-positive individuals plays a vital role in improving their nutritional intake, medication tolerance and effectiveness, treatment success rate, and quality of life. It is therefore important to ensure optimal dental care of this group of people, especially since more of them, with or without knowledge of their serologic status, are now utilizing dental services. The objective of this study was to assess Nigerian dental students' willingness to treat HIV-positive individuals. A descriptive cross-sectional survey of all seventy-six final-year dental students of the University of Benin, Nigeria, was conducted in December 2007 using a self-administered questionnaire that elicited information on the students' demography, self-rated knowledge on HIV/AIDS, attitude towards homosexuals, infection control practices, occupational risk perception, and willingness to provide care for HIV-positive individuals. The response rate was 76.3 percent. Over 77 percent of the respondents were in the twenty-five to thirty years age group. The male-female ratio was approximately 1.6:1. HIV-related knowledge was reported as high by only 31 percent of the respondents. Eighty-one percent showed great interest in HIV-related information, while about half (53.4 percent) exhibited significant worry about occupational contagion. Forty-eight (82.7 percent) desired more knowledge about safety precautions during treatment of HIV patients. Fifty respondents (86.2 percent) reported good infection control practices. About three-fourths (74.2 percent) rated the risk of HIV contagion from patients high, while only one-fourth (25.8 percent) reported having an unsympathetic attitude towards homosexuals. Almost all respondents (98.3 percent) agreed that oral care for HIV-positive individuals improves their quality of life, but only 58.8 percent expressed a willingness to treat HIV-positive patients and only 46.5 percent said they will render volunteer dental services in HIV centers. HIV prevalence will determine the location of practice of 41.4 percent of the respondents. The result suggests the need to have a comprehensive educational/motivational program for the next generation of dentists in Nigeria in order to ensure adequate care of HIV-positive individuals. The perceived deficiency revealed in this study can also serve as a vital guide for curriculum change on HIV-related issues."
13363,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of and identify factors associated with lifetime testing for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in non-injection drug users (NIDU). A cross-sectional study was conducted with 323 individuals in clinics for chemical dependency in the state of Goiás in the Central-West region of Brazil. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with lifetime HIV testing. Testing for HIV was associated with age, female gender, crack use, history of sexually transmitted infections, acquaintance with people living with HIV/AIDS and/or who had died from AIDS, and history of having received some instruction on HIV/AIDS prevention methods. It was found that only 26.6% reported having access to the HIV rapid test. We concluded determinants for HIV testing must be taken into account when planning prevention and programming strategies. These include the widening of testing coverage among NIDU, educational health actions, establishment of links between sexually transmitted infection prevention services and addiction treatment services, and the use of rapid tests to help people who are in contact with the virus learn about their HIV status, enter treatment, and improve their quality of life."
17174,0.005,1.0000,"The HIV-infected population in the USA is expanding as patients survive longer and new infections are identified. In many areas, particularly rural/medically underserved regions, there is a growing shortage of providers with sufficient HIV expertise. HIV services incorporated into community-based (CB), primary care settings may therefore improve the distribution and delivery of HIV treatment. Our objective was to describe/compare patients and treatment outcomes in two settings: a community-located, primary care-based HIV program, and a hospital-based (HB) specialty center. CB providers had on-site access to generalist HIV experts. The hospital center was staffed primarily by infectious disease physicians. This was a retrospective cohort study of 854 HIV-positive adults initiating care between 1/2005 and 12/2007 within an academic medical center network in the Bronx, NY. Treatment outcomes were virologic and immunologic response at 16-32 and 48 weeks, respectively, after combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) initiation. We found that HB subjects presented with a higher prevalence of AIDS (59% vs. 46%, p<0.01) and lower initial CD4 (385 vs. 437, p<0.05) than CB subjects. Among 178 community vs. 237 hospital subjects starting cART, 66% vs. 62% achieved virologic suppression (95% confidence interval (CI) difference -0.14-0.06) and 49% vs. 59% achieved immunologic success, defined as a 100 cell/mm³ increase in CD4 (95% CI difference 0.00-0.19). The multivariate-adjusted likelihoods of achieving viral suppression [OR=1.24 (95% CI 0.69-2.33)] and immunologic success [OR=0.76 (95% CI 0.47-1.21)] were not statistically significant for community vs. hospital subjects. Because this was an observational study, propensity scores were used to address potential selection bias when subjects presented to a particular setting. In conclusion, HIV-infected patients initiate care at CB clinics earlier and with less advanced HIV disease. Treatment outcomes are comparable to those at a HB specialty center, suggesting that HIV care can be delivered effectively in community settings."
3906,0.005,1.0000,"The objectives of this study were to document the prevalence of facial lipodystrophy in patients with HIV infection receiving protease inhibitors and to identify associated factors. All patients with HIV infection receiving protease inhibitors seen at an HIV clinic in Hong Kong during a 2-month period, from August to October 1997, were assessed for facial lipodystrophy. Among 29 patients who had been receiving indinavir for 3 months or more, facial lipodystrophy was found in 7 (24%). Facial lipodystrophy in these patients was found to be an isolated event and was not associated with noticeable wasting elsewhere. The development of facial lipodystrophy was not found to be associated with age, sex, ethnicity, route of HIV transmission, CD4 cell count, history of AIDS-defining illness, or concurrent anti-retroviral treatment. Facial lipodystrophy was not observed in patients who had received indinavir for less than 3 months. The condition was also not found in patients taking other protease inhibitors, although this could be due to the small sample size. Prospective study of this condition with a larger sample and with objective anthropomorphic measurements would be desirable. In conclusion, facial lipodystrophy is a common occurrence among patients receiving indinavir, and physicians should be alerted to this condition."
4302,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to report prevalence rates of adherence by HIV-seropositive individuals to medical recommendations for the treatment of HIV infection, a behavioral pattern referred to as AIDS secondary prevention. We report cross-sectional data (n = 2,593) from two household-based and two bar-based samples of gay/bisexual men, gathered in 1992 in Tucson, Arizona, and Portland, Oregon. The main outcome variables were prevalence of HIV antibody testing and adherence to recommended secondary prevention behaviors to prevent onset of AIDS symptoms. Approximately one-third of the gay/bisexual men in these samples do not know their current HIV status. Of the gay/bisexual men who do know that they are HIV-seropositive, approximately three-fourths adhere to each of the secondary prevention recommendations, as appropriate to their stage of disease progression. In a multivariate logistic model, three variables distinguished between HIV-seropositive men who did and did not adhere: perceived antiviral treatment norms (OR = 1.4, CI = 1.1-1.7), perceived efficacy of secondary prevention treatments (OR = 1.4, CI = 1.1-1.7), and quality of the relationship with one's health-care provider (OR = 2.5, CI = 1.6-4.0). These findings indicate that efforts to support AIDS secondary prevention behaviors can occur not only through health education to change the perceptions of at-risk communities about the options available to delay the onset of opportunistic infections among HIV-seropositive individuals but also by enhancing effective doctor/patient communication."
17321,0.005,1.0000,"Induction of broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies (NAb) is an important goal for a prophylactic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine. Some HIV-infected patients make a NAb response that reacts with diverse strains of HIV-1, but most candidate vaccines have induced NAb only against a subset of highly sensitive isolates. To better understand the nature of broad NAb responses that arise during natural infection, we screened patients for sera able to neutralize diverse HIV strains and explored the frequency and phenotype of their peripheral Envelope-specific B cells. We screened 113 HIV-infected patients of various clinical statuses for the prevalence of broad NAb. Sera able to neutralize at least four of five viral isolates were found in over one-third of progressors and slow progressors, but much less frequently in aviremic long-term nonprogressors. Most Env-specific antibody-secreting B cells were CD27(hi) CD38(hi) plasmablasts, and the total plasmablast frequency was higher in HIV-infected patients than in uninfected donors. We found that 0.0031% of B cells and 0.047% of plasmablasts secreted Env-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. We developed a novel staining protocol to label HIV-specific B cells with Env gp140 protein. A total of 0.09% of B cells were found to be Env-specific by this method, a frequency far higher than that indicated by ELISPOT assay. gp140-labeled B cells were predominantly CD27(+) and surface IgG(+). These data describe the breadth and titer of serum NAb and the frequency and phenotype of HIV-specific B cells in a cohort of patients with broad cross-neutralizing antibody responses that are potential goals for vaccines for HIV."

Ten thalassemic and four hemodialysis patients were included in the study. Chronic HCV was confirmed with both serum HCV-RNA and liver histopathology. IFN alpha-2a was administered three times a week for 24-48 weeks, at a dose of 5 MU/m2 (maximum 6 million units). Sustained response was defined as negative HCV-RNA at least 24 weeks after termination of the treatment. All patients completed the study. Eight of 10 thalassemic (80%) and one of four hemodialysis patients (25%) showed a sustained response. IFN monotherapy proved to be an effective treatment, especially in thalassemic patients with chronic HCV. IFN monotherapy seems reasonable for patients with thalassemia and chronic hepatitis C virus in whom ribavirin cannot be used."

They were followed for 19 months after cessation of therapy. Sustained serum HCV RNA clearance occurred in 42% of patients treated for 6 months and in 64% of those treated for 12 months. HCV was eradicated from 6 of 13 patients infected with HCV genotype 1b and from 2 of 6 patients also infected with hepatitis G virus. HCV RNA remained undetectable in both serum and a liver biopsy of 2 patients who were given cadaveric kidney transplants after IFN-alpha treatment. These data suggest that HCV RNA-positive dialysis patients can be considered for treatment while receiving dialysis, particularly those awaiting transplant."
17190,0.005,1.0000,"An enzyme immuno assay for hepatitis C core antigen was recently developed and its performance was compared with that of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in the screening of HCV infection in patients on hemodialysis. One hundred and eleven chronic renal failure patients undergoing haemodialysis between May 2003 and October 2004 were included in the study. All the patients were tested for anti HCV antibody, core antigen and RNA. Fifteen patients were anti HCV antibody positive, three patients were positive for HCV core antigen and RNA, three patients were positive for HCV RNA, while two patients were positive only for core antigen but negative for RNA. In anti HCV antibody positive patients, the core antigen was negative while the viral RNA continued to be present. Hence, relying solely on a single HCV core antigen assay may not be useful for a definite diagnosis of early HCV infection. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 60% and 83% respectively, while the positive predictive value was 14.3%, negative predictive value was 97.7% and the efficiency was 81.9%."
14322,0.005,1.0000,"This study was designed to evaluate the seroprevalence of hepatitis G virus (HGV) infection, its impact, and its relationship with other hepatotropic viruses among chronic renal failure patients undergoing hemodialysis at the Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi. The study group consisted of 100 consecutive cases of patients with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis and equal healthy controls matched for age and sex. The patients were included on the basis of detailed history, clinical examination, and liver function profile. HGV RNA was detected in serum samples of all patients as well as of healthy controls using nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The primers used were derived from the NS3 helicase region of the viral genome. Serological assay was used for screening the viral markers for hepatitis B and C (HbsAg and Anti HCV). A history of blood transfusion was recorded in 65% of the cases. HGV RNA was detected in only six out of 100 (6%) cases of chronic renal failure. The seroprevalence of HCV infection was detected in 27 (27%), while HBV infection was seen in 10 (10%) out of 100 cases. The mixed infection of HGV and HCV was seen in 33.3% (two out of six) of the chronic renal failure cases, while the coinfection between HGV and HBV was not observed. In the 100 cases of healthy controls, HGV RNA was detected in only three (3%) subjects. Serological markers for Anti HCV antibody and HbsAg were positive in only one (1%) and two (2%) of the subjects, respectively. The seroprevalence of HGV infection in chronic renal failure was found to be statistically nonsignificant when compared to that of healthy controls. Also, there was no difference in clinical course and liver function profile of HGV-positive and HGV-negative cases. However, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was significantly out of range in HCV-positive patients compared with HCV-negative patients. The presence of HGV infection reflected a postparental exposure to blood and blood-contaminated products in hemodialysis patients. It is suggested that HGV infection in cases of chronic renal failure is unlikely to influence the course of the disease and may be considered an innocent bystander."
16279,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment of human plasma with methylene blue in combination with visible light (MB/light) inactivates several bloodborne viruses such as retro viruses and herpes viruses. The viral nucleic acid is thought to be a critical target for the inactivation procedure. We investigated the effects of photodynamic treatment on the RNA of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) using Amplicor reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which detects and quantifies a small fragment of the viral RNA. The detectable HCV RNA load (5-nontranslated region) in infected human plasma declined by 94-97 % within 10 min of illumination in small-scale experiments (1-2 ml vol.). Since the same effect was observed in both anti-HCV positive and negative (""window"") samples, it can be concluded that HCV antibodies do not influence virus inactivation by photodynamic treatment. The effect of treatment on RT-PCR signals of HIV-1, which is known to be inactivated rapidly by MB/light treatment, was examined. Plasma was infected with HIV-1 and subjected to RT-PCR, which detected a part of the gag gene. The extent and kinetics of PCR signal reduction induced by MB/light treatment were similar to those observed for HCV. Experiments at production scale where single plasma units (300 ml) were infected with HCV showed reduction rates of PCR signals consistent with those measured in the small-scale experiments. The data support the view that MB/light treatment affects the viral nucleic acids and suggest that HCV is susceptible to the procedure."
3856,0.005,1.0000,"The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically improved the life expectancy of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although patients often have excellent disease control with these combinations of antiretrovirals, they are at risk for the multiple toxicities associated with these drugs. Facial lipoatrophy is a particularly distressing complication of some HAART regimes. This disfigurement can lead to significant psychosocial stress, resulting in decreased treatment compliance. Polylactic acid (PLA) facial implants provide a potential method of restoring a normal appearance. One hundred consecutive patients had a course of PLA facial implants. All patients were assessed clinically and had photographs, facial surface laser scans and completed psychological questionnaires throughout the course of treatment. After a mean of 4.85 treatments per patient, there were improvements in all measures. The mean clinical scores improved from a moderate-severe grade to none-mild grade after treatment. Three-dimensional (3D) laser surface scans showed a volume increase of 2.81 cc over the treated area of the cheek. There were significant improvements in all of the psychological measures. This study shows clear objective evidence of the psychological and physical benefit of PLA implants in HIV-associated facial lipodystrophy."

A substantial proportion (41.9%) reported never having been tested for HIV, including fully one-third of those who were ""very afraid"" of getting acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Independent correlates of HIV testing included younger age, felony criminal history, stronger therapeutic alliance with one's primary clinician, and increased drug problems and psychological distress. Of those tested, nearly all (96.5%) reported receiving the test results; however, only half (50.5%) reported receiving any posttest counseling. Independent correlates of posttest counseling included higher educational level, felony criminal history, and receipt of community-based case management services. Greater efforts are needed to increase HIV testing and counseling among persons with serious mental illness to better identify and care for HIV-positive individuals and potentially reduce future transmission of the virus in this vulnerable, at-risk population."
11343,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to determine the presence of kidney tubular damage in the absence of overt evidence of glomerular dysfunction (GFR>60 ml/min without proteinuria) in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Urine kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) levels were measured by ELISA and expressed as a ratio to creatinine. Sixty-six patients (median age 38 years) and 10 healthy controls (median age 35.5 years) were included in the study. Patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, or kidney disease were excluded from the study. All patients received tenofovir/emtricitabine combined with one of three other components, namely efavirenz, atazanavir/norvir, or lopinavir/norvir. A lower concentration of L-FABP/creatinine was observed in HIV-infected as compared to healthy individuals (p=0.0353); KIM-1/creatinine was also lower in comparison with healthy controls but not statistically significantly. Patients receiving efavirenz had higher levels of L-FABP/creatinine in comparison to healthy controls (p=0.0039). Patients with anti-HCV had higher concentrations of L-FABP/creatinine as compared to the HIV-monoinfected individuals (not statistically significant) and to healthy subjects (p=0.0356). All four patients with L-FABP>17.5 μg/g creatinine were HIV/HCV coinfected. On multivariate logistic regression urine L-FABP above 5.5 μg/g creatinine was independently associated with body weight (OR=0.93 p=0.039). This study suggests that HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with lower body weight treated with tenofovir may be at an increased risk of tubular dysfunction and should be monitored more closely. The use of protease inhibitors was not associated with an increased risk of tubular disorders."

Patients and Methods We conducted a retrospective medical record review of adult, HIV-infected cancer patients treated in our institutions from January 2010 to December 2015. Patients eligible for the present analysis were those receiving a raltegravir-based HAART at the time of the initiation of a MKI for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. Treatment-related toxicity, virological outcomes and pharmacokinetic profile of MKIs were examined. Results Twelve patients (7 males, median age 55 years) were identified. Seven had sarcoma/GIST, 3 had hepatocellular carcinoma, one had pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, and one had NSCLC. Patients received the following MKIs: imatinib (n = 3), sorafenib (n = 3), pazopanib (n = 3), sunitinib (n = 2) and erlotinib (n = 1). The mean CD4+ count at baseline was 929 cells/mm"

Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify links with antiretroviral treatments, anti-HCV therapy and clinical and laboratory findings. One hundred eleven (28.9%) of 383 patients who received at least one dose of anti-HCV treatment subsequently had severe weight loss. Among patients who took at least 80% of the planned total dose, severe weight loss occurred in 74 patients (32.7%). In multivariate analysis, age >40 years [hazard ratio (HR), 1.59; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.31; P = 0.016], body mass index (BMI) >22 (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.16 to 2.55; P = 0.0069), peg-IFN alpha-2b (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.69; P = 0.0022) and female sex (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.43; P = 0.027) were associated with severe weight loss. In contrast, patients taking non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)-containing antiretroviral regimens were less likely to lose weight (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.96; P = 0.034). Lipodystrophy tended to occur more frequently in patients who had severe weight loss than in the other patients (26.1%vs 17.6%; P = 0.0682) and patients whose weight loss >5% persisted 24 weeks after the completion of anti-HCV therapy (n = 58 / 111) were more likely to be receiving stavudine-based antiretroviral therapy, suggesting that mitochondrial toxicity plays some role in weight loss. These findings show that severe weight loss is a frequent side effect of anti-HCV therapy in HIV / HCV-coinfected patients. The underlying mechanisms remain to be identified."
6752,0.005,1.0000,"One third of HIV-infected individuals worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Two main reasons justify considering HCV therapy as a priority in HIV-coinfected patients. First, these patients have more rapid liver disease progression, and second, they have a higher risk of developing hepatotoxicity following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Unfortunately, HCV therapy is associated with lower response rates and higher rate of side effects in HIV-coinfected patients. However, recent evidence suggests that when HCV therapy is administered adequately (to optimal candidates; using full doses of ribavirin; at least for 12 months irrespective of the HCV genotype; and with satisfactory drug adherence), treatment responses may not differ much from those seen in HCV-monoinfected individuals. Treatment should be considered up front in antiretroviral-naive subjects with stable HIV infection. In patients already on antiretroviral therapy, HCV therapy should not be administered before replacing didanosine by another antiretroviral, given the increased risk of mitochondrial toxicities. If possible, zidovudine should be avoided as well, given the high risk of anemia. The histological information provided by either non-invasive procedures (FibroScan, Fibro-test, etc.) or liver biopsy is useful but should not be considered as mandatory before prescribing HCV therapy. In summary, liver disease associated to HCV is a growing problem among HIV-positive individuals. The relatively low efficacy of current anti-HCV medications and their low tolerability clearly indicated the need for new drugs with more potent and direct antiviral activity against HCV."
11810,0.005,1.0000,"In a background of very high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among women of childbearing age and the increasing demand for treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission, we investigated the desire for a future pregnancy among women in Zimbabwe in relation to (1) self-perceived risk of HIV infection, (2) child mortality, and (3) spontaneous abortion. A random cross-sectional sample of 2250 ever-married women aged 15-49 years was selected from 6,828 households in rural and urban Zimbabwe. The sample was representative of the geographic distribution of women. One eligible subject was selected per household for a structured interview on factors associated with the desire for future pregnancy. Overall, 54% of the participants desired to get pregnant in future; 55% perceived themselves at high risk for HIV infection; 6% reported the death of at least one child less than the age of 5 years in the last 5 years; and 12% reported at least one spontaneous abortion in the last 5 years. In multiple logistic regression analysis, reporting at least one child's death (OR = 1.77; 95% CI 1.13-2.78) and at least one spontaneous abortion in the last 5 years (OR = 1.81; 95% CI 1.08-3.04) were significantly associated with a higher desire to get pregnant; however, high self-perceived risk for HIV infection was not (OR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.67-1.09). High self-perceived risk for infection with HIV was not associated with a lower desire for a future pregnancy among women in Zimbabwe in a high-prevalence area. In fact, our data suggest an increased desire for future pregnancy to replace childhood deaths or spontaneous abortions that may result from HIV infection. Voluntary HIV testing services are challenged with balancing counseling messages on the strong desire for children, the risk of mother-to-child transmission, and poor fetal outcomes. Further research is needed to explore utilitarian-economic, social, and psychological values attributed to children by women and their partners. The involvement of men as partners in childbearing should be explored, as their desire for children may be the primary barrier to protective behavior change among women."
13090,0.005,1.0000,"Functional hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific T cells are significantly diminished in individuals chronically infected with HBV compared to individuals with self-limiting HBV infection or those on anti-HBV therapy. In individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), coinfection with HBV is associated with an increased risk of worsening liver function following antiviral therapy and of more rapid HBV disease progression. Total HBV-specific T-cell responses in subjects with diverse genetic backgrounds were characterized by using a library of 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids and spanning all HBV proteins. The magnitude and breadth of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses to HBV in peripheral blood were examined by flow cytometry to detect gamma interferon production following stimulation with HBV peptide pools. Chronic HBV carriers (n = 34) were studied, including individuals never treated for HBV infection (n = 7), HBV-infected individuals receiving anti-HBV therapy (n = 13), and HIV-1-HBV-coinfected individuals receiving anti-HBV therapy (n = 14). CD4(+) and CD8(+) HBV-specific T-cell responses were more frequently detected and the CD8(+) T-cell responses were of greater magnitude and breadth in subjects on anti-HBV treatment than in untreated chronic HBV carriers. There was a significant inverse correlation between detection of a HBV-specific T-cell response and HBV viral load. HBV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses were significantly (fivefold) reduced compared with HIV-specific responses. Although, the frequency and breadth of HBV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses were comparable in the monoinfected and HIV-1-HBV-coinfected groups, HBV-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses were significantly reduced in HIV-1-HBV-coinfected individuals. Therefore, HIV-1 infection has a significant and specific effect on HBV-specific T-cell immunity."
15104,0.005,1.0000,"HIV quality performance measurements are critical to evaluating a care program's success in areas of testing, access to and retention in care, care processes and outcomes. Kaiser Permanente (KP) provides care to over 8 million Americans and over 19,000 HIV-infected adults. We undertook a quality performance measurement program to assess the care and outcomes for our HIV-positive patient population. We also examined HIV testing practices among our HIV-uninfected patients presenting with a sexually transmitted infection. Our metrics were extracted electronically (encompassing two time periods: July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006 and the entire calendar year 2007) and did not require any manual data extraction, which was a primary objective of our strategy. For most individual care measures, improvement over time was noted, with 85% or more performance seen on some measures (accessing care and initiating antiretroviral therapy). Opportunities for improvement were identified on other measures, such as diagnosing HIV at an earlier stage of infection, and more consistent Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis. Over 90% of our patients on antiretroviral therapy had maximal viral control, along with high median antiretroviral medication adherence. Our results compare favorably to those of other organizations, with a KP HIV mortality rate less than 50% of the overall U.S. rate. These results have implications for improving our care process going forward, as well as for the new U.S. domestic HIV/AIDS Strategy."
19149,0.005,1.0000,"Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has expanded rapidly throughout sub-Saharan Africa, but malnutrition and food insecurity have emerged as major barriers to the success of ART programs. Protein-calorie malnutrition (a common form of malnutrition in the region) hastens HIV disease progression, and food insecurity is a barrier to medication adherence. Analyses of patient outcomes have identified a low body mass index after the start of ART as an independent predictor of early mortality, but the causes of a low body mass index are multifactorial (eg, normal anthropometric variation, chronic inadequate food intake, and/or wasting associated with HIV infection and other infectious diseases). Although there is much information on population-level humanitarian food assistance, few data exist to measure the effectiveness of macronutrient supplementation or to identify individuals most likely to benefit. In this report, we review the current evidence supporting macronutrient supplementation for HIV-infected adults, we report on clinical trials in resource-adequate and resource-constrained settings, and we highlight priority areas for future research."
4280,0.005,1.0000,"The objective was to assess the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) economic burden of illness in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) population. Adults (aged 18-64 years) with a HIV diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases 9th Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] code 042.x, V08) from 1 June 2007 to 31 May 2012 were selected from VHA Medical SAS(®) data-sets. Continuous VHA insurance coverage 12-month pre- and postindex date, with no antiretroviral therapy (ART) prescriptions within 180 days pre-index date, was required for treatment-naive (TN) HIV-infected patients. One baseline CD4 count or HIV viral load measured within three months after HIV diagnosis or one ART anchor drug claim postindex date was required for group comparison. All-cause health-care costs and utilizations were evaluated and stratified by CD4 cell count, viral load, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) anchor drugs (efavirenz/non-efavirenz), and ART (NNRTI/PI/INSTI/CCR-5 Antagonist-based) regimen cohorts. The overall economic burden was compared between HIV-infected vs. non-HIV-infected patients. CD4 count, viral load, and treatment patterns and the associated costs were compared among TN patients. A 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust for baseline differences. A total of 25,648 HIV-infected patients were identified (mean age 51; 96.4% male; 49.7% non-Hispanic black) of which 11,371 were TN. HIV-infected patients incurred higher PSM-adjusted total costs than non-HIV-infected patients ($25,232 vs. $10,206, p < 0.0001). Total costs for TN with CD4 cell counts ≤50 cells/mm(3) were higher than all other CD4 cell strata (p < 0.001). Total costs for TN with viral loads >100,000 copies/mL were higher than all other viral load categories (p < 0.001). Efavirenz-treated patients incurred higher ART-related ($8663 vs. $2846, p = 0.0266), but lower non-ART-related ($2339 vs. $6628, p = 0.0042) pharmacy costs than non-efavirenz patients. NNRTI-based cohort incurred lower total costs than protease inhibitor-based ($32,829 vs. $39,073, p = 0.0005) but no significant differences compared to integrase strand transfer inhibitor cohorts. This study offers new health-care costs and resource utilization estimates associated with the burden of HIV in the VHA population."
12739,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is, to a great extent, a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Its diffusion among the heterosexual population is still limited. STD treatment centres are particularly well organized to watch this diffusion. At the STD centre of the Saint-Louis hospital, Paris, we conducted a 6-week prospective study concerning the systematic detection of HIV-1 infection in 240 consecutive female out-patients in 1988, and in 504 male out-patients in 1989. The results obtained were as follow: 5/240 women (2.1 percent) and 19/504 men (3.8 percent) were seropositive for HIV-1. Out of these 24 subjects, 15 did not know they were seropositive. Predictive factors for seropositivity were male homosexuality, addiction to heroin and, in women, drug addicts as sex partners. Altogether, 23 of the 24 seropositive subjects had the classical risk factors for HIV-1 infection. None of the 744 subjects in this study were HIV-2 seropositive, and only 1 out of 504 men was HTLV-1 seropositive. We conclude that the prevalence of HIV-1 infection was high in our centre, and this prompts us to suggest that the serological test should be proposed to all out-patients and that patient's education and preventive measures should be organized by STD centres, even though the infection is still limited to patients at a particularly high risk (drug addicts, homosexuals, country of origin)."
12423,0.005,1.0000,"Zidovudine (AZT) is a potent inhibitor of the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and it has been shown to improve survival in advanced HIV disease. We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial in adults with asymptomatic HIV infection who had CD4+ cell counts of fewer than 500 per cubic millimeter on entry into the study. The subjects (92 percent male) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: placebo (428 subjects); zidovudine, 500 mg per day (453); or zidovudine, 1500 mg per day (457). After a mean follow-up of 55 weeks (range, 19 to 107), 33 of the subjects assigned to placebo had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), as compared with 11 of those assigned to receive 500 mg of zidovudine (P = 0.002; relative risk, 2.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 5.6) and 14 of those assigned to receive 1500 mg of zidovudine (P = 0.05; relative risk, 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 3.5). In the three treatment groups, the rates of progression (per 100 person-years) to either AIDS or advanced AIDS-related complex were 7.6, 3.6, and 4.3, respectively. As compared with those assigned to placebo, the subjects in the zidovudine groups had significant increases in the number of CD4+ cells and significant declines in p24 antigen levels. In the 1500-mg zidovudine group, severe hematologic toxicity (anemia or neutropenia) was more frequent than in the other groups (P less than 0.0001). In the 500-mg zidovudine group, nausea was the only toxicity that was significantly more frequent (in 3.3 percent) than in the placebo group (P = 0.001). We conclude that zidovudine is safe and effective in persons with asymptomatic HIV infection and fewer than 500 CD4+ cells per cubic millimeter. Additional study will be required to determine whether such treatment will ultimately improve survival for persons infected with HIV."

To determine the status of HIV infection in a Mississippi adolescent population, we evaluated seroprevalence rates for adolescents attending Mississippi State Department of Health STD clinics from 1988 to 1990. During this 2-year period, 9855 adolescents (aged 13 to 20 years) attended STD clinics, and HIV antibody was confirmed in 39 (seroprevalence rate 4.0/1000; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.7 to 5.2). Seropositive rates were almost equal for male and female subjects (4.1/1000 and 3.8/1000, respectively), suggesting predominantly heterosexual transmission. Rates among blacks were 3.5 times higher than among whites. Adolescents with HIV infection were identified throughout the state, irrespective of urban centers. Rates among the smallest counties (ie, population less than 25,000) were not significantly different from those of the largest counties (ie, population greater than 100,000). Mississippi's rank in the top 10 states for other STDs and the state's high teenage pregnancy rate make it an epicenter of the HIV epidemic among adolescents."

All had moderately advanced disease with an immune complex-dissociated (ICD) p24 antigen >70 pg/mL and were on stable antiviral therapy. Three groups of 10 children received 6 monthly infusions of 200, 400, or 800 mg/kg of HIVIG, and serial immunologic and virologic assays were performed. HIVIG doses as high as 800 mg/kg were safe and well tolerated. The half-life of HIVIG, determined by serial p24 antibody titers, was 13-16 days, the volume of distribution was 102-113 mL/kg, and clearance was 5.6-6.0 mL/kg/day. Plasma ICD p24 decreased during the infusions, but CD4 cell levels, plasma RNA copy number, cellular virus, immunoglobulin levels, and neutralizing antibody titers were minimally affected by the infusions. Clinical status did not change during the 6-month infusion and 3-month follow-up periods."

The multicenter trial involved 260 HIV-infected patients with CD4 cell counts < 0.2 x 10(9)/L and no history of PCP. Patients were randomly assigned to the treatment groups. After a median follow-up of 376 days (range, 1-1219), none of the patients developed PCP.

9250,0.005,1.0000,"We present the results of a 6-year study of 131 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 2 (HIV-2)-infected individuals from a rural population in Guinea-Bissau. Proviral DNA sequences 1.3 kb in length were obtained from each individual and, together with clinical data, including proviral load and CD4 and CD8 levels, were used to assess whether viral genotype influences clinical outcome. With a phylogenetic model, a correlation was found between viral genotype and mortality; this correlation was not due to confounding factors, such as age-specific viral strains or cohabitation of patients. The data provide strong evidence for the involvement of viral genetic factors in determining HIV disease progression in vivo. The pattern of association found suggests that virulence factors are multiple and scattered throughout the HIV-2 genome and can be rapidly gained or lost by the virus through a combination of mutation and recombination. These findings may lead to the identification of viral determinants of HIV disease progression."
16733,0.005,1.0000,"We undertook this study to assess the association between the various potential causes of liver disease in HIV-seropositive patients and mortality due to liver failure. Three hundred and eight in-hospital deaths were observed from 1987 to December 1995 in a prospectively followed cohort of 1894 HIV-seropositive patients. For each study subject, clinical data were evaluated to assess whether liver failure had substantially contributed to mortality. A case control study nested in the cohort was then performed, which compared demographic and clinical variables observed at enrollment and during follow-up between patients who died for liver disease as the main or concurrent cause of death (cases) and those who died as a result of illness related to AIDS or other causes (controls). Among 308 in-hospital deaths, liver failure was found the cause of death in 35 patients (12%); in 16 cases, it was the primary cause and in 19 cases it was concurrent. Multivariate analysis showed that in-hospital liver-disease-related mortality was independently associated with hepatitis B surface antigen reactivity (odds ratio [OR], 9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.8-21.7) and history of alcohol abuse (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1-5.2).

15660,0.005,1.0000,"Initial reports have suggested that approximately 10% of patients with HIV-infection develop HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). It has also been predicted that by the end of the decade, HIVAN is likely to become a third leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in African-Americans between the ages of 20-64 years. As the morbidity and mortality from HIV-infection has decreased in the last few years, it is possible that prevalence of HIVAN is also changing. We therefore screened HIV-1-infected patients followed in our hospital for HIVAN. A screening urinalysis was performed in 557 HIV-1-infected adult patients between March and May 1998. Of these, 252 were outpatients and 305 were Texas Department of Criminal Justice inmates (TDCJI). Demographic and laboratory data of these patients was obtained from the HIV patients' database. Fifty percent of the patients were African-American, 36.6% were Caucasian and 12. 7% were Hispanic. The mean age of patients was 37 +/- 8 years. Seventy-nine percent of the patients were males and a history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) was present in 28%. Twenty-three percent of the patients were concomitantly infected with hepatitis C virus, 4.1% were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, and rapid plasma reagin test for syphilis was positive in 9.1%. In 38 patients who had more than 100 mg/dl (2+) proteins on screening urinalysis, total urinary proteins were quantitated by collecting 24 h urine specimens. Fifteen of these patients had urinary proteins more than 1.5 g/day (12 patients >3.5 g/24 h and 3 patients >1.5 g/24 h). A renal biopsy was done in 14 of these patients and clinical diagnosis of HIVAN was made in one patient who refused biopsy. Renal biopsies revealed HIVAN [9], diabetic nephropathy [2], membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis [2], Fibrillary glomerulonephritis [1]. All 10 patients (5 TDCJI and 5 outpatients) with HIVAN were African-American. Two of these 10 patients had a history of IVDA and another two were concomitantly infected with hepatitis C virus. The plasma viral load (Pvl) and total CD4 count was not different in patients with or without HIVAN [(Pvl log 10.05 +/- 1.39 vs. 9.9 +/- 2.18 copies/ml, p = 0.78) (CD4: 187 +/- 192 vs. 288 +/- 249 cells/microl, p = 1.17) mean +/- SD].

11054,0.005,1.0000,"One hundred twenty major general surgical procedures were performed on 88 adult patients harboring the human immunodeficiency virus. Fifty-eight (48%) of the procedures were performed on patients who fulfilled the criteria for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The patients were predominantly male (94%). Single risk factors included homosexuality (73% of cases), intravenous drug abuse (8%), and previous blood transfusions (8%). Four patients (5%) had multiple risk factors; risk factors were denied by seven patients (8%). The mean age at surgery was 41.6 years (range, 22 to 67 years). Surgical conditions that rarely affect the population without the human immunodeficiency virus presented diagnostic challenges. Altered physiologic responses to even routine conditions were observed. Thirty-day morbidity rates for emergency (group A) and elective (group B) procedures were 19% and 9%, respectively. This included seven surgical deaths (13%) in group A and one in group B (2%). Patients undergoing 92 of 112 procedures (82%) not associated with surgical mortality were followed up. Patients who were dead at follow-up had mean procedure-survivals of 19 weeks (group A) and 21 weeks (group B) for 33 procedures. Those who remained alive had a mean procedure-survival of 86 weeks for 59 procedures. No single prognosticator could be correlated with outcome, although the combination of hypoalbuminemia with a history of opportunistic infection(s) was associated with short survival. Emergency and elective procedures can be performed in the patient with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Procedures are indicated to extend patient life or to improve quality of life."
4129,0.005,1.0000,"HAART has increased the life expectancy of patients with HIV. However, as their life expectancy increases, it becomes increasingly important to focus on the management of concurrent illnesses such as chronic HBV and HCV infections which have the potential to increase mid to long term morbidity and mortality. Shared epidemiological risks have resulted in the HIV infected population having a higher incidence of both HBV and HCV than those uninfected with HIV. Co-infection with HIV modifies the natural history of HBV infection, increasing the rate of viral replication, risk of carriage and chronic hepatitis but without increasing liver necroinflammatory processes. In chronic HCV infection, the presence of HIV enhances the risk of severe liver disease. There is no evidence as yet that HBV directly impacts on HIV disease progression but HCV infection increases the risk of death or an AIDS defining illness and impairs CD4+ T cell recovery during antiretroviral therapy. Treatment of either hepatitis virus is complex because of pharmacokinetic interactions with components of HAART regimens."
12072,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality to those infected with HIV since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The presence of HIV clearly has a negative effect on the natural history of HCV, although there is some debate over whether HCV influences the natural history of HIV. Given the prevalence of co-infection and the accelerated liver damage from HCV, treatment of chronic HCV infection is an important consideration in patients co-infected with HIV. There are few studies of pegylated interferon and ribavirin in co-infected populations, but it seems that the treatment is well tolerated, although it is possibly less effective in this group. HAART in the setting of HCV infection also requires some special consideration, namely an increased incidence of hepatotoxicity. Treatment of co-infected patients requires close monitoring as current therapies are not ideal in terms of effectiveness, and toxicity may be severe."
13038,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical profile of end-stage acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A cross-sectional examination of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who attended a public HIV outpatient clinic and died between 1996 and 2001 was conducted (n = 669). All clinical and demographic data were collected from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Adult Spectrum of Disease database. The prevalence of first-time acquisition of AIDS-defining conditions 12 months before death were evaluated. The prevalence of renal disease, hepatic disease and substance use were also evaluated. The majority of the patients were 35 years old or older, male, African American and HAART-experienced. The six AIDS-defining conditions with the highest percentages of first-time acquisition in the last 12 months of life were HIV dementia (91.8%), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (91.7%), wasting (90.9%), Mycobacterium avium complex infection (MAC) (80.0%), lymphoma (78.6%), and cytomegalovirus infection (CMV) (78.1%). Forty-four percent of the patients were diagnosed with at least one of these six conditions 12 months before death. More than one third of the patients had renal or hepatic failure, injecting drug use (IDU) as the HIV risk factor, and history of substance use. AIDS-defining conditions continue to have an impact on mortality, especially the neurologic conditions and wasting. However, other conditions, such as renal and hepatic disease, are becoming important causes of mortality because the HIV-infected population now includes more drug users, and HIV-infected patients are surviving for longer periods. These results should help clinicians better time the discussion of end-stage options and improve the patient's quality of life."
8609,0.005,1.0000,"Central nervous system (CNS) human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection begins during primary viremia and continues throughout the course of untreated systemic infection. Although frequently accompanied by local inflammatory reactions detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), CNS HIV-1 infection usually is not clinically apparent. In a minority of patients, CNS HIV-1 infection evolves into encephalitis during the late stages of systemic infection, which compromises brain function and presents clinically as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome dementia complex (ADC). Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has had a major impact on all aspects of CNS HIV-1 infection and disease. In those with asymptomatic infection, ART usually effectively suppresses HIV-1 in CSF and markedly reduces the incidence of symptomatic ADC. In those presenting with ADC, ART characteristically prevents neurological progression and leads to variable, and at times substantial, recovery. Similarly, treatment has reduced CNS opportunistic infections. With better control of these severe disorders, attention has turned to the possible consequences of chronic silent infection and the issue of whether indolent, low-grade brain injury might require earlier treatment intervention."

They present a challenge for health care providers because of language and cultural differences that can create barriers to effective health care. Nurse practitioners who work with Southeast Asian refugees should be aware that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly endemic in Southeast Asia, and the virus is most commonly transmitted during the perinatal period or during childhood. HBV infection can cause acute hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular carcinoma and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Susceptible children and infants born to mothers who are hepatitis B carriers should be vaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccine. Vaccination can prevent the serious sequelae of HBV in a high percentage of the pediatric population."
16042,0.005,1.0000,"Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and is associated with a variety of lymphocyte-mediated disorders. HTLV-1 transmission occurs by transmission of infected cells via breast-feeding by infected mothers, sexual intercourse, and contaminated blood products. The route of exposure and early virus replication events are believed to be key determinants of virus-associated spread, antiviral immune responses, and ultimately disease outcomes. The lack of knowledge of early events of HTLV-1 spread following blood-borne transmission of the virus in vivo hinders a more complete understanding of the immunopathogenesis of HTLV-1 infections. Herein, we have used an established animal model of HTLV-1 infection to study early spatial and temporal events of the viral infection. Twelve-week-old rabbits were injected intravenously with cell-associated HTLV-1 (ACH-transformed R49). Blood and tissues were collected at defined intervals throughout the study to test the early spread of the infection. Antibody and hematologic responses were monitored throughout the infection. HTLV-1 intracellular Tax and soluble p19 matrix were tested from ex vivo cultured lymphocytes. Proviral copy numbers were measured by real-time PCR from blood and tissue mononuclear leukocytes. Our data indicate that intravenous infection with cell-associated HTLV-1 targets lymphocytes located in both primary lymphoid and gut-associated lymphoid compartments. A transient lymphocytosis that correlated with peak virus detection parameters was observed by 1 week postinfection before returning to baseline levels. Our data support emerging evidence that HTLV-1 promotes lymphocyte proliferation preceding early viral spread in lymphoid compartments to establish and maintain persistent infection."
4208,0.005,1.0000,"Headache in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may indicate life-threatening illnesses such as opportunistic infections or neoplasms. Alternatively, such patients may develop benign self-limiting headaches. Hence, defining the various types of headache in these patients is essential for proper management. This study describes the clinical characteristics of primary headaches occurring in a group of HIV-infected patients. Of 115 patients seen from 1990 to 1996, 44 (38%) had headaches. Primary headaches were present in 29 (66%) patients and secondary causes were identified in 15 (34%). Among those with primary headaches, migraine occurred in 22 (76%), tension-type headache in 4 (14%), and cluster headache in 3 (10%) patients. Half of those with migraine (n=ll), 1 patient with tension-type headache, and 1 patient with cluster headache developed chronic daily headaches which were severe and refractory to conventional headache or antiretroviral therapy. We conclude that primary headaches in patients with HIV infection are: (1) the commonest type of headache; (2) may present for the first time in individuals with severe immunosuppression; (3) usually bear no relationship to antiretroviral drug therapy; (4) polypharmacy, depression, anxiety, and insomnia are commonly associated comorbidities; (5) frequently do not respond to conventional management and carry a poor prognosis; and (6) do not require neuroradiological and/or cerebrospinal fluid evaluations."
1258,0.005,1.0000,"The primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), commonly described in patients with AIDS, is a unique subset of diffuse large cell lymphoma in which the malignant lymphocytes proliferate exclusively in serous cavities. The cytologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular features of PEL are presented from findings of 2 patients coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus who presented with abdominal pain. Abdominal radiography in both patients displayed marked peritoneal effusions. Cytomorphologic examination of peritoneal fluid revealed a malignant lymphoma in both. Their immunophenotypic expression was CD30 (Ki-1) and epithelial membrane antigen. Molecular analysis demonstrated human herpesvirus 8 DNA in both patients and bcl-2 oncogene rearrangement within the major breakpoint region of t(14;18) chromosome translocation in Case B only. Clinical correlation supports the current concept that PEL represents a primary HIV/AIDS-related lymphoma in effusion. Cytomorphologic examination of body cavity fluid serves as a tool for the initial diagnosis of PEL."
4647,0.005,1.0000,"Recent studies on the coreceptor usage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strains associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia have shown that both X4 and R5 viruses are involved in the process. The disease is associated with enhanced virus replication and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 production in macrophages in the brain. Using the macaque model of the disease, the authors show here that X4, macrophage-tropic simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) required the enhancing effect of interleukin (IL)-4 to achieve equivalent concentrations of virus and MCP-1 that are produced in macrophages infected with R5 viruses alone. Confocal microscopy showed that macrophages in the encephalitic brains were the major producers of MCP-1. The authors surmise, therefore, that whereas R5 viruses maybe capable of causing the disease as a primary pathogen, X4 viruses may require IL-4, induced by opportunistic pathogens, for induction of the neuropathological syndrome."

We postulated that-particularly in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contribute to poor outcome. CSF from 149 Malawian adults with bacterial meningitis and 39 controls were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction. EBV was detected in 79 of 149 bacterial meningitis patients. Mortality (54%) was associated with higher CSF EBV load when adjusted for HIV (P = .01). CMV was detected in 11 of 115 HIV-infected patients, 8 of whom died. The mechanisms by which EBV and CMV contribute to poor outcome require further investigation."
18182,0.005,1.0000,"The stability of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies was studied for samples of sera, vitreous fluid and bile obtained from eight HIV-positive autopsy cases. The autopsy delay was on average 5 days. The samples were stored at room temperature (20 degrees C) for 51 to 314 days and tested repeatedly. In Western blotting on fresh postmortem samples, the antibodies detected most of the proteins of the virus. Antibodies against all major envelope, core and transmembrane proteins, although weakened, were also detected in stored sera. In stored vitreous fluid and bile the envelope protein gp 160, the transmembrane protein gp 41 and in half of the cases also the major core protein p 24 could still be detected. The disappearance of p 24 was associated with AIDS, but was detected in all samples from patients with early infection. Of screening tests, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay applying synthetic peptide as an antigen detected antibodies from all serum samples, but was less applicable to vitreous fluid or bile. Another immunoassay, applying recombinant antigen, succeeded in vitreous fluid and bile but not in sera. The rapid visually read assay detected antibodies in most samples of fresh whole blood, bile and in most of the vitreous samples, but was less useful on stored specimens."
12937,0.005,1.0000,"Human papilloma virus (HPV)-related cutaneous manifestations occur with increased frequency and severity among HIV-infected persons. In this report, we describe an HIV-infected man with persistent, severe cutaneous hand warts that did not respond to multiple therapies, including liquid nitrogen cryotherapy, topical dinitrochlorobenzene, topical podophyllin, and intralesional interferon-alfa injections. Approximately 1 year after starting a potent protease inhibitor-containing antiretroviral regimen, the patient's recalcitrant cutaneous warts markedly diminished in size, even though the patient did not receive any specific therapy for the warts after starting aggressive antiretroviral therapy. The patient continued on a potent protease inhibitor-containing antiretroviral regimen and, approximately 2 years later, the warts completely resolved. Our patient's dramatic clinical improvement of cutaneous HPV infection that followed protease inhibitor-containing antiretroviral therapy provides a clear-cut example that protease inhibitor-containing combination antiretroviral therapy can produce significant clinical benefit."
11212,0.005,1.0000,"Disclosure of HIV-positive status has important implications for patient outcomes and preventing HIV transmission, but has been understudied in TB-HIV patients. We assessed disclosure patterns and correlates of non-disclosure among adult TB-HIV patients initiating ART enrolled in the START Study, a mixed-methods cluster-randomized trial conducted in Lesotho, which evaluated a combination intervention package (CIP) versus standard of care. Interviewer-administered questionnaire data were analyzed to describe patterns of disclosure. Patient-related factors were assessed for association with non-disclosure to anyone other than a health-care provider and primary partners using generalized linear mixed models. Among 371 participants, 95% had disclosed their HIV diagnosis to someone other than a health-care provider, most commonly a spouse/primary partner (76%). Age, TB knowledge, not planning to disclose TB status, greater perceived TB stigma, and CIP were associated with non-disclosure in unadjusted models (p < .1). In adjusted models, all point estimates were similar and greater TB knowledge (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-0.90) and CIP (aOR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.79) remained statistically significant. Among 220 participants with a primary partner, 76% had disclosed to that partner. Significant correlates of partner non-disclosure (p < .1) in unadjusted analyses included being female, married/cohabitating, electricity at home, not knowing if partner was HIV-positive, and TB knowledge. Adjusted point estimates were largely similar, and being married/cohabitating (aOR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.12), having electricity at home (aOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17-0.85) and greater TB knowledge (aOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.98) remained significant. In conclusion, although nearly all participants reported disclosing their HIV status to someone other than a health-care provider at ART initiation, nearly a quarter of participants with a primary partner had not disclosed to their partner. Additional efforts to support HIV disclosure (e.g., counseling) may be needed for TB-HIV patients, particularly for women and those unaware of their partners' status."
5820,0.005,1.0000,"To determine whether the sex, race, or sexual preference of a patient infected with immunodeficiency virus (HIV) influences a physician's decision to breach patient confidentiality, Tennessee primary care physicians were mailed a questionnaire containing a case study in which an HIV-infected patient presented a risk to a third party. Eight different descriptions of the sex, race, and sexual preference of the hypothetical patient were distributed randomly among the physicians, one description to each physician. The physicians were asked to decide whether to maintain confidentiality, notify the health department, or inform the patient's partner. Responses of 199 White male physicians were analyzed using an unconditional saturated logistic regression model. The odds ratios for these physicians saying they would send the patient's antibody status to the health department extend from 18.4 (95 percent confidence interval: 1.3, 260.1) for Black homosexual males to .5 (95 percent CI: 0, 11.5) for White homosexual females. The odds ratios for White male physicians saying they would inform the patient's partner range from 7.5 (95 percent CI: .8, 69.2) for Black heterosexual males to 1.0 (reference category) for Black homosexual females. The results suggest that when physicians decide to protect a third party by breaching an HIV-infected patient's confidentiality, their decision may be influenced in some cases by the race, sex, and sexual preference of the patient."

6246,0.005,1.0000,"Several all-oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) combination therapies including two fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) have been recently licensed for treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection. Results of pivotal trials with these new compounds are now also available in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV-coinfected patients, highlighting that, in the DAA era, differences no longer do exist in efficacy between HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. This review will give an overview of the key DAA-containing studies in HIV/HCV genotype 1 coinfection and give guidance on how and when these should be used in clinical practice. Simplified DAA-based and potentially interferon-free HCV therapy regimens are characterized by smaller pill burden, better tolerability, shorter treatment durations, and higher cure rates. With first pilot studies in HCV treatment-naive and treatment-experienced persons with HCV/HIV coinfection demonstrating sustained virological response rates above 95 %, interferon (IFN)-free DAA combinations should be considered the new standard of care for chronic HCV. Per both European and US treatment guidelines, HCV treatment indications and DAA drug selection in HIV-coinfected patients are no longer different from HCV-monoinfected patients as cure rates in HCV-monoinfected and HCV-coinfected patients are superimposable. Drug-drug interactions with the new DAAs and concomitant antiretroviral therapy, however, have to be checked carefully prior to selecting DAAs due to commonly shared metabolization pathways. In countries with access to the new DAAs, interferon-free DAA combination therapy for HCV genotype 1 infection is strongly recommended. Agents should be selected based upon HCV genotype and according to current guidelines. Potential drug-drug interactions between HIV antiretrovirals and HCV therapy need to be checked, and if necessary, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has to be adapted to the respective HCV therapy. Key Points• HCV treatment in HIV-coinfected patients is the same as in HCV-monoinfected patients as response rates under DAA in the setting of HIV coinfection have been as good as in HCV-monoinfected patients. • IFN-free DAA combinations should be considered standard of care for chronic HCV genotype 1 coinfection. • Drug-drug interactions with the new DAAs and concomitant antiretroviral therapy have to be accounted for due to shared metabolic pathways via the cytochrome p450 system and drug transporters. • Major limitations in treatment uptake are access to DAA which is increasingly driven by the cost of the medications.

4466,0.005,1.0000,"Currently, the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus involves combination therapy, as antiretroviral therapy(ART). The treatment has improved steadily since the advent of potent combination therapy in 1996. New drugs that offer new mechanisms of action, improvements in potency and activity even against multidrug-resistant viruses, dosing convenience, and tolerability have been approved. Among ART with useful drugs, there are two important examinations before starting the treatment using the two kinds of drug. CCR5 co-receptor antagonists, maraviroc, prevent HIV entry into target cells by binding to CCR5 receptors. Genotypic assays have been developed that can determine or predict the co-receptor tropism(i.e., CCR5, CXCR4, or both) of the patient's dominant virus population. The assay for HIV-1 co-receptor usage should be performed whenever the use of a CCR5 antagonist is being considered. One of the nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), abacavir, is an important agent to develop recommended regimens for antiretroviral therapy. Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with abacavir-containing products, ZIAGEN, Epzicom, and Triumeq. Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at high-risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. Prior to initiating therapy with abacavir, performing a screening test for the HLA-B*5701 allele is recommended. [Review]."

Phenotypic analysis revealed impaired replicative capacity of mutants, which could be restored by concomitant precore or basal core promoter mutations (HBe-antigen-negativity).

8327,0.005,1.0000,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) has affected an estimated of 80 million individuals worldwide and is a strain on public health. Around 25-30% of patients in Europe and the US who are infected with HIV are coinfected with HCV. Prior to 2013, treatment modalities containing an NS3/4A protease inhibitor in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin improved sustained virological response (SVR) rates. However, rates of severe side effects were high. Nowadays, oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) combination therapy offers excellent treatment efficacy, safety and tolerability. Areas covered: This review focuses on the current literature and clinical evidence and their impact regarding NS3/4A protease inhibitors. The pitfalls encountered in treating HIV- and HBV-coinfected patients are also discussed. Expert opinion: In the era of DAA treatment, third-generation pan-genotypic NS3/4A protease inhibitors (mainly glecaprevir and voxilaprevir) show high antiviral activity and a genetic resistance barrier with cure rates of over 95% when combined with an NS5A inhibitor, irrespective of baseline resistance associated variants (RASs) being present. These new key components of DAA combination therapy are impressive options to eradicate HCV in the so-called difficult-to-treat population (e.g. compensated cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease and patients who failed previous DAA treatment)."
13093,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment response rates remain low in HCV/HIV-1-coinfected individuals compared with those with HCV alone. Persons with inherited coagulation disorders have high rates of HCV and HIV-1 infection, but HCV treatment trials in this patient population are scarce. We hypothesized that differences by infection status in HCV viral kinetics would be associated with differences in HCV quasispecies complexity over time and with treatment response disparities. Coinfected and monoinfected patients were enrolled in a treatment trial for pegylated-interferon alpha-2a (peg-IFN) + ribavirin. Patients were treated for 48 weeks and followed for an additional 24. Quantitative HCV RNA was tested at multiple times during and after treatment. Viral kinetic parameters associated with response were estimated with a mathematical model. Quasispecies emergence was determined via heteroduplex complexity assay. Twenty-two patients were HCV RNA-positive at baseline, with no significant demographic or virological differences by infection status. Five of eleven (45%) of monoinfected and 3 of 11 (27%) of coinfected patients achieved sustained viral response (SVR). Peg-IFN efficacy (epsilon) of 90% or greater was associated with probability of end-of-treatment response (ETR) (P = .001) and SVR (P = .06). Patients with SVR had lower baseline quasispecies complexity than those without SVR (P = .07). Those with epsilon of 90% or greater also had lower baseline complexity (P = .07). Coinfection status mediated changes in complexity over time (P = .04). In conclusion, low pretreatment quasispecies complexity may predict peg-IFN response; early peg-IFN response is critical for sustained HCV clearance and is altered in coinfection. Further studies are warranted."

All six patients were homosexual men. Five patients had AIDS and one was HIV-positive. The most common symptoms and signs were pain (n = 5), mass (n = 5), and bleeding (n = 5). The average tumor size was 3.2 cm with a range of 1-10 cm. Five tumors were located in the anal canal and one at the anodermal junction. One patient was treated with biopsy alone, one with local excision, one with wide local excision and radiation therapy, and two with diverting colostomy. The average follow-up was 8 months. Of the five AIDS patients, two died, one was transferred to a hospice facility, one was lost to follow-up, and one remains alive 1 year following treatment. The HIV-positive patient died secondary to metastatic SCCA. This group of patients raises the question of a possible association between HIV and SCCA."
1393,0.005,1.0000,"Approximately one third of all HIV-infected people are coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The progression from initial HCV infection to cirrhosis of the liver is accelerated in coinfected patients compared with HCV-monoinfected patients. Because of improved therapies for HIV/AIDS, one of the leading causes of death for HIV-infected patients is liver disease. It is therefore important to screen all persons with HIV infection for the presence of HCV and to treat the HCV infection as appropriate. Treatment options need to be tailored to each patient, depending on the severity of liver damage, the HCV genotype, and the willingness of the patient to receive therapy. Current first-line therapy for hepatitis C consists of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. However, this therapy has only limited success in persons with HCV genotype 1 and in African Americans. In addition, the side effects of anti-HCV therapy can be considerable and require careful management. Improvement or delayed progression of fibrosis should be the main goal of therapy in most patients."
14107,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of the study was to evaluate the role of rapid virological response (RVR) in predicting sustained virological response (SVR) rates to hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy. 65 HIV / HCV co-infected patients commenced HCV treatment per protocol. HIV / HCV patients with a mean CD4 count of 502 were treated for 24-48 weeks depending on genotype. Virological response was assessed at weeks 4 (RVR), 12 [early virological response (EVR)], 24, at end of treatment (EOTR) and 24 weeks post-completion of treatment (SVR). Primary end-point was defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment completion. Fifty-five per cent of co-infected patients were on highly active anti-retroviral therapy. A majority of patient group were male. 60% of HIV / HCV patients achieved SVR (35% genotype 1 / 4; 77% genotype 2 / 3). 24 HIV / HCV patients achieved undetectable HCV levels compared with baseline by week 4. The positive predictive value (PPV) of RVR at week 4 for subsequent SVR in HIV-HCV co-infected patients was 100%; the negative predictive value (NPV) was 57%. Significant variables associated with SVR were: (i) lower median pre-treatment HCV viral load, (ii) genotype 2 / 3 disease and (iii) achievement of RVR. Independent variables associated with RVR were low pre-treatment HCV viral load and genotype 2 / 3 disease. Achievement of RVR, a negative HCV-PCR, at week 4 of treatment is predictive of SVR in this cohort of patients. This may be used to guide optimal treatment duration in patient groups. More significantly, the data serve to highlight the subgroup of patients who, on achieving RVR, should be actively supported to complete HCV treatment with full dose therapy, especially patients co-infected with G2 / 3 disease for whom 6 months' full dose therapy may be sufficient to obtain a SVR."

However, little is known about the specific contribution of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to stroke among HIV-infected individuals. The aims of this study were to analyze trends in the incidence rates of stroke in HIV-infected individuals during the combination antiretroviral (cART) era in Spain and to categorize them by the presence or absence of HCV coinfection. We analyzed hospital discharges with a diagnosis of stroke in Spain according to ICD-9-CM during 1997-2013. The study period was divided into four calendar periods (1997-1999, 2000-2003, 2004-2007, and 2008-2013). Patients were classified according to HCV serology. The number of HIV-infected patients was estimated based on data from the National Centre of Epidemiology. We calculated incidence rates (events per 10,000 patient-years) and in-hospital case fatality rates (CFR). The incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (HS) decreased in HIV-monoinfected patients (15.8 [1997-1999] to 6.5 [2008-2013]; P<0.001) and increased in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (1.3 [1997-1999] to 5.5 [2008-2013]; P<0.001). The incidence of ischemic stroke (IS) decreased in HIV-monoinfected patients (27.4 [1997-1999] to 21.7 [2008-2013]; P = 0.005) and increased in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (1.8 [1997-1999] to 11.9 [2008-2013]; P<0.001). The CFR was 3.3 times higher for HS than for IS for the whole study period. The CFR of HS in HIV-monoinfected patients decreased significantly (47.4% [1997-1999] to 30.6% [2008-2013]; P = 0.010) but did not change significantly among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (41.4% [1997-1999] to 44.7% [2008-2013]; P = 0.784). The CFR of IS in the whole HIV-infected population decreased significantly (14.6% [1997-1999] to 10.9% [2008-2013]; P = 0.034), although no significant differences were found when each group was analyzed separately. In conclusion, after the introduction of cART, HS and IS rates decreased in HIV-monoinfected individuals, but increased steadily in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals."

We analyzed data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR; 2002-2011): 510 adult kidney transplant recipients with HIV (median follow-up, 3.8 years) matched 1:10 to HIV-negative controls. Compared with HIV-negative controls, HIV-infected recipients had significantly lower 5-year (75.3% versus 69.2%) and 10-year (54.4% versus 49.8%) post-transplant graft survival (GS) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.15 to 1.64; P<0.001) that persisted when censoring for death (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.84; P=0.005).

Unfortunately, there is little information available on the characteristics and emergency clinical problems of HIV-infected patients to guide physicians in patient care and strategies for resource use. Preliminary data from an on-going investigation revealed that there were 254 emergency visits (1.8% of total) by 164 patients with known HIV infection during the four-month period of March to June 1988. Only 171 visits (62%) were likely related to patients' underlying HIV infection. Nine percent of IV drug users (IVDUs) carried a diagnosis of AIDS before presentation compared with 68% of patients who were homosexual or bisexual. Fifty-five patients (21.7%) presented with their first known complication of HIV. Among the 140 risks from patients previously considered asymptomatic, those with homosexual or bisexual risk were 3.6-fold more likely to present with a first-time complication of HIV than were IVDUs. HIV-infected patients were twice as likely to have inadequate insurance compared with a sample of ED seronegative controls. Of the 130 risks by IVDUs, 85% were without adequate insurance coverage compared with 56% of the 91 patient risks from homosexual or bisexuals (P less than .05). Generally, patient presentations did not imply an obvious diagnosis; vague constitutional complaints were the most common (42%). Preliminary interpretation of the data is that IVDUs use emergency services as a routine source of care. Because IVDUs probably represent those with more recent infection and HIV infection continues to spread unabated in this risk group, we can expect increasing numbers of patients to present to EDs with symptomatic HIV infection in the future.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
14933,0.005,1.0000,"As increasing numbers of persons are placed on potentially life-saving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in sub-Saharan Africa, it is imperative to identify the psychosocial and social factors that may influence antiretroviral (ARV) medication adherence. Using an 87 question survey, the following data were collected from patients on cART in Botswana: demographics, performance (Karnofsky) score, perceived stigma and level of HIV disclosure, attitudes and beliefs concerning HIV/AIDS, substance and/or drug use, depression, and pharmacy and healthcare provider-related factors. Overall adherence rates were determined by patient self-report, institutional adherence, and a culturally modified Morisky scale. Three hundred adult patients were recruited between April and May 2005. The overall cART adherence rate was 81.3% based on 4 day and 1 month patient recall and on clinic attendance for ARV medication refills during the previous 3 months. Adults receiving cART for 1-6 months were the least adherent (77%) followed by those receiving cART for greater than 12 months (79%). Alcohol use, depression, and nondisclosure of positive HIV status to their partner were predictive of poor adherence rates (p value <0.02). A significant proportion (81.3%) of cART-treated adults were adherent to their prescribed treatment, with rates superior to those reported in resource-rich settings. Adherence rates were poorest among those just starting cART, most likely due to the presence of ARV-related toxicity. Adherence was lower among those who have been treated for longer periods of time (greater than 1 year), suggesting complacency, which may become a significant problem, especially among these long-term cART-treated patients who return to improved physical and mental functioning and may be less motivated to adhere to their ARV medications. Healthcare providers should encourage HIV disclosure to ""at-risk"" partners and provide ongoing counseling and education to help patients recognize and overcome HIV-associated stigma, alcohol abuse, and depression."
15999,0.005,1.0000,"We investigated the effects of glutathione (GSH), the major naturally occurring thiol, and a pharmacologic thiol precursor of GSH, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), on the expression of human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) in primary cord blood and adult donor monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). HIV-1 infection of cord blood and adult MDM was accomplished after incubating 10-15-d-old cultures for 4 h with a monocyte-tropic strain of HIV-1 (Bal). After 1 wk in culture cell supernatants were tested for reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. MDM were exposed to 5, 10 and 20 mM concentrations of both GSH and NAC before infection, during infection, and after infection was established. GSH and NAC suppressed the replication of HIV-1 in both primary cord blood and adult donor MDM in a concentration dependent fashion. These suppressive effects were more pronounced in cord-derived cells than in adult-derived cells. In cells treated with GSH or NAC before infection, there was no significant rise in RT activity as compared with controls. Similarly, when cells were treated with GSH and NAC and simultaneously infected, there was also no significant rise in RT activity after 1 wk in culture. In cells treated after infection was established, RT values were suppressed 80-90% that of untreated controls. This effect persisted for 1-2 wk after exposure to GSH and NAC. Untreated controls demonstrated syncytium formation and lost characteristics of spreading and elongation 2 wk after HIV-1 infection, whereas most of the treated cells remained free of syncytium and retained cytoplasmic spreading, adherence, and elongation. These data are consistent with other studies of thiol suppression of HIV-1 replication and demonstrate a similar observation for primary cultured cord MDM. These results may offer new approaches toward cellular protection after infection with HIV-1."
17447,0.005,1.0000,"Although there is widespread interest in understanding how models of care for delivering antiretroviral therapy (ART) may influence patient outcomes, family-focused approaches have received little attention.

14938,0.005,1.0000,"The use of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures to provide added feedback to health providers is receiving interest as a means of improving clinical care and patient outcomes, and contributing to more patient-centered care. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), while PROs are used in research, their application in clinical practice has been limited despite their potential utility. PRO selection is an important consideration when contemplating their use. As past reviews of PROs in HIV have focused on particular areas (e.g. disability, satisfaction with care), a more comprehensive review could better inform on the available instruments and their scope. This article reviews HIV-specific PROs to produce an inventory and to identify the central concepts targeted over time. Seven databases were searched (HAPI, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar), generating 14,794 records for evaluation. From these records, 117 HIV-specific PROs were identified and categorized based on a content analysis of their targeted concept: Health-Related Quality of Life (23; 20 %), ART and Adherence-Related Views and Experiences (19; 16 %), Healthcare-Related Views and Experiences (15; 13 %), Psychological Challenges (12; 10 %), Symptoms (12; 10 %), Psychological Resources (10; 9 %), HIV Self-Management and Self-Care (8; 7 %), HIV-Related Stigma (8; 7 %), Body and Facial Appearance (4; 3 %), Social Support (3; 3 %), Sexual and Reproductive Health (2; 2 %), and Disability (1; 1 %). This review highlights the variety and evolution of HIV-specific PROs, with the arrival of seven categories of PROs only after the advent of highly-active antiretroviral therapy. Our inventory also offers a useful resource. However, the interest of further HIV-specific PRO development should be explored in sexual health, which received little independent attention."

Managing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load, through taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial to long term survival of persons with HIV. Many persons with HIV have difficulty adhering to their ART over long periods of time. PHRs contribute to chronic disease self-care and may help persons with HIV remain adherent to ART. Proportionally veterans with HIV are among the most active users of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) PHR, called My HealtheVet.

Little is known about the factors associated with patients' willingness to accept providers' recommended ART changes. This multicenter prospective observational study examined factors associated with willingness to accept ART changes recommended by their providers among HIV-infected adults from six urban outpatient HIV clinics. Patients were surveyed using the Patient Attitudes about Altering Antiretroviral Therapy Survey questionnaire (PAAARTS). Factors associated with willingness to accept ART changes were assessed using a multivariate generalized estimating equation (GEE) model to account for correlated responses. The Classification and Regression Trees (CART) analysis was also performed to determine subgroups of patients with higher acceptance of change. 216 of 289 patients (75%) definitely accepted recommended changes. Odds for acceptance were 3.2, 2.3, and 2.8 times higher for patients with higher attitudes and beliefs about ART (p < 0.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.59, 6.52), patients who rated their provider's care as excellent (p < 0.05; 95% CI = 1.07, 4.78), and non-Hispanic patients (p < 0.05; 95% CI 1.03, 7.57), respectively. CART analysis showed similar results and identified that when patients had less positive attitude about ART, acceptance rates were higher for non-Hispanic patients with higher assessments of their patient-provider communication. While most patients accepted providers' recommendation for ART changes, this willingness was influenced by both patients' attitudes and beliefs about ART and their assessment of either the effectiveness of patient-provider communication or their rating of providers' care. ART acceptance rates among Hispanic patients were lower."
12024,0.005,1.0000,"Rollout of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been successfully initiated in many countries, but concerns have been raised about the ability to meet treatment needs in areas where there is a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and where there are severe deficits in human-resource capacity. Many health care workers in resource-poor areas are experiencing burnout, struggling with external and internal stigma, failing to access HIV testing and treatment early, and subsequently becoming sick and dying of AIDS. Although the human-resource deficit is a well-recognized problem, little has been written about the programs that have been established to provide treatment for HIV-infected health care workers. In the present article, we describe staff care programs at McCord Hospital in Durban, South Africa; Mseleni Hospital in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa; and the Tshedisa Institute in Gaborone, Botswana. These programs provide convenient, confidential, and holistic care for HIV-infected health care workers and health care workers affected by caring for HIV-infected patients. All 3 programs have noted that, among health care workers, there is increasing acceptance of counseling, testing, and treatment. We propose that there is an urgent need for the development of HIV/AIDS care and treatment programs for health care workers that remove barriers to access, provide confidentiality in testing, are conveniently located, and are integrated with tuberculosis programs and other treatment services."

Critical care may be required for patients with HIV because of severe opportunistic infections or malignancy, antiretroviral drug toxicity, or critical illness seemingly unrelated to HIV, and each of these scenarios may present different management challenges. In this article, the epidemiology of HIV-related ICU admission is reviewed and key management issues are discussed. "
11844,0.005,1.0000,"There are little data on antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among patients in Eastern Europe, despite the high incidence of HIV infection and the growing number of HIV-infected individuals who are being prescribed ART. The aim of this study was to measure rates of adherence to ART and factors associated with nonadherence among patients receiving care at an outpatient HIV clinic in Estonia. The study was based on cross-sectional data from a convenience sample of 144 patients receiving outpatient HIV care. Data were obtained via interviewer-administered surveys and data abstraction from clinical records. Adherence was measured from a 3-day patient self-report. Among 144 participants (mean age 33.8 years), two-thirds (63%) had been infected with HIV through intravenous drug use. Most (74%) were co-infected with hepatitis C (HCV). Perfect adherence over the last 3 days was commonly reported (88% [95% CI 81-92%]) with nonperfect adherence associated with greater concerns about the potential adverse consequences of taking ART (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.8, 95% CI 1.2-34.0) and average (versus good/very good) self-reported health status (AOR 4.7, 95% CI 1.2-31.4). Self-reported ART adherence in this sample of Estonian HIV-positive patients in clinical care was similar to rates observed in Western Europe and other developed countries. Results suggest that adherence education and support may be most helpful if they specifically target the development of positive beliefs, reduction of negative expectancies towards ART."

There has been little attention to changes in these disparities over time. We estimated the proportion of PWID and non-IDU retained in care, on ART, and virally suppressed each year from 2001-2012 in the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort (JHHCC). We defined active clinic patients as those who had ≥1 clinical visit, CD4 cell count, or viral load between July 1 of the prior year, and June 30 of the analysis year. Within a calendar year, retention was defined as ≥2 clinical visits or HIV-related laboratory measurements >90 days; ART use was defined as ≥1 ART prescription active ≥30 days; and viral suppression was defined as ≥1 HIV viral load <400 copies/mL. While PWID were less likely to be retained in earlier years, the gaps in retention closed around 2010. After 2003-2004, PWID and non-IDU retained in care had similar probability of receiving a prescription for ART and PWID and non-IDU on ART had similar probability of viral suppression."

Adherence is a challenge in all HIV infected people on ART. It is especially a concern in children because of factors relating to children such as age, disclosure status of HIV sero status, and understanding of the medication.

10440,0.005,1.0000,"Women with perinatally acquired HIV (PAH) face unique psychosocial challenges due to the presence of a lifelong chronic illness and often unstable living situations. With advances in HIV treatment, an increasing number of those with PAH are reaching childbearing age and becoming pregnant. Depression may be an important and common factor that complicates both treatment and pregnancy outcomes in this group. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in pregnant patients with PAH to determine if history of depression is associated with nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We reviewed charts of women with PAH receiving prenatal care at a single institution from March 1995 to December 2012. ART nonadherence was measured by patient self-report of any missed doses in the third trimester. Demographic, obstetric, and HIV infection characteristics of patients with a history of depression (dPAH) were compared to patients without a history of depression. Nine pregnancies among 6 dPAH women and 14 pregnancies among 12 PAH women without a history of depression were identified. None of the dPAH women reported 100% adherence to ART in the third trimester while 57% of women without a history of depression reported strict adherence (p = 0.04). The mean HIV RNA level at delivery was higher among dPAH women (17,399 vs. 2966 copies/Ml; p = 0.03) and fewer reached an undetectable HIV RNA level (<400 copies/mL) at delivery (p = 0.03). We concluded that a history of depression may contribute to poor medication adherence and treatment outcomes among pregnant women with PAH. Focused attention on diagnosis and treatment of depression in the preconception period may lead to more optimal medication adherence. "
3437,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is integral to the successful treatment of HIV infection. Research has indicated that HIV-infected Latinos may have difficulty adhering to ART. While studies have demonstrated strong relationships between numerous psychosocial factors and ART adherence, no research has examined if cultural factors are also involved in ART adherence among Latinos. Our study examined the relationship between acculturation to mainstream U.S. culture, bicultural self-efficacy, and ART adherence among HIV-infected Puerto Rican adults living in the United States. Participants with ≥ 95% adherence scored higher on U.S.- and Latino-involvement acculturation scales and on a measure of bicultural self-efficacy compared to those with suboptimal adherence. Among bicultural HIV-infected Puerto Ricans, both acculturation and self-efficacy to navigate between cultures were positively related to adherence. Understanding the role of an individual's sociocultural experience may help elucidate why HIV-infected Latinos have difficulties achieving optimal ART adherence and improve ART adherence interventions."
19531,0.005,1.0000,"This study examined the association between two components of the Health Belief Model (perceived vulnerability and barriers) and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among children who are HIV-infected. The parents/caregivers of 30 children (mean age = 5.21, SD = 3.18) who were HIV-infected and who were on active ART were surveyed to assess current methods of adherence assessment and educational efforts within the institution. All participants (except one) were African American and reported low monthly family incomes (M = $869.45, SD = $832.63). Assessment instruments included measures of perceived vulnerability, caregiver-reported adherence and perceived barriers, and objective measures of adherence (clinical pill count; electronic measurement). The results failed to demonstrate a significant relationship between parental perceived vulnerability, perceived barriers and adherence to antiretroviral medications. Methods of assessing adherence provided significantly discrepant estimates of adherence. Results are discussed in terms of implications for patient care and for future research in this area. The addition of behavioural and motivational components to traditional educational approaches may positively impact treatment results."

3991,0.005,1.0000,"A mathematical model examined a potential therapy for controlling viral infections using genetically modified viruses. The control of the infection is an indirect effect of the selective elimination by an engineered virus of infected cells that are the source of the pathogens. Therefore, this engineered virus could greatly compensate for a dysfunctional immune system compromised by AIDS. In vitro studies using engineered viruses have been shown to decrease the HIV-1 load about 1000-fold. However, the efficacy of this potential treatment for reducing the viral load in AIDS patients is unknown. The present model studied the interactions among the HIV-1 virus, its main host cell (activated CD4+ T cells), and a therapeutic engineered virus in an in vivo context; and it examined the conditions for controlling the pathogen. This model predicted a significant drop in the HIV-1 load, but the treatment does not eradicate HIV. A basic estimation using a currently engineered virus indicated an HIV-1 load reduction of 92% and a recovery of host cells to 17% of their normal level. Greater success (98% HIV reduction, 44% host cells recovery) is expected as more competent engineered viruses are designed. These results suggest that therapy using viruses could be an alternative to extend the survival of AIDS patients."

The aim of this study was to examine the associations between adherence and severity of substance use as well as adherence and severity of depressive symptoms among Iranian HIV patients. In a prospective study, HIV patients with current substance use were assessed for adherence level via self report and pill count methods, severity of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory- II) and substance use (Addiction Severity Index) during a three months follow up after initiating antiretroviral therapy. The adherence level, severity of depressive symptoms and substance use were assessed one month, two months and three months after initiation of anti-retroviral therapy. Addiction Severity Index (ASI) composite scores were calculated for each domain and the associations between ASI domains and adherence as well as severity of depressive symptoms and adherence were assessed. Twenty six HIV patients with current substance use disorder completed the study. At the end of the first month, adherence to therapy via pill count and self-report were 80%±31.9% and 85.12%±32%, respectively. At the end of the second month, adherence to therapy via pill count and self report were 87%±32% and 93.94%±23% respectively. At the end of the third month, the measured adherence via pill count and self report were 85%±33.7% and 90.1%±25.7% respectively. Adherence was higher among married patients and those who used reminder systems. Composite scores of the medical status and psychiatric status were related to higher adherence after first month. Substance use was inversely associated with adherence at the second follow up (r=-0.4, p=0.04). Also, severity of depressive symptoms was not related to adherence level. The repeated measurement analysis showed a significant decrease in psychiatric status domain of the ASI composite score after three months of initiating therapy (p=0.02). Preventive measures should aim treatment of substance use among HIV patients in order to increase adherence level. Also, conducting psychological evaluations is necessary considering the high prevalence of depression among Iranian HIV patients. "

These renal diseases usually present as a nephrotic syndrome with progressive loss of renal function and an increased risk of mortality. The prevalence and epidemiology of these renal lesions remain largely undefined; however, most studies agree that black race is a major risk factor for HIVAN. Observational studies have suggested that antiretroviral medications and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have beneficial effects on slowing the progression of renal disease among patients with HIVAN; however, little is known about the effect of these therapies on other renal lesions. Future research should focus on gaining a better understanding of the distribution and determinants of renal disease among HIV-infected patients as well as on performing controlled studies to test treatment strategies."
14594,0.005,1.0000,"The emergence of syncytium-inducing (SI) variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in infected individuals is an indicator of poor prognosis and is often correlated with faster CD4(+) cell depletion and rapid disease progression. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a pleiotropic cytokine with various immune-modulating functions including induction of immunoglobulin E (IgE) production in B cells, down-regulation of CCR5 (a coreceptor for HIV-1 non-SI [NSI] strains), and up-regulation of CXCR4 (a coreceptor for HIV-1 SI variants). Here we show that homozygosity of a polymorphism in the IL-4 promoter region, IL-4 -589T, is correlated with increased rates of SI variant acquisition in HIV-1-infected individuals in Japan. This mutation was also shown to be associated with elevated serum IgE levels in HIV-1-infected individuals, especially in those at advanced stages of disease. In contrast, neither a triallele polymorphism in IL-10, another Th2 cytokine, nor a biallele polymorphism in the RANTES promoter affected acquisition of the SI phenotype. This finding suggested that IL-4-589T increases IL-4 production in the human body and thus accelerates the phenotypic switch of HIV-1 from NSI to SI and possibly disease progression of AIDS."

A high dose acyclovir treatment was effective, but recurrences occurred twice when the treatment was discontinued. During the first recurrence the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected the presence of VZV in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of secondary varicella with pulmonary involvement. Secondary varicella pneumonia has not been reported in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adult until now. The use of PCR on a BAL sample was very useful in this case because viral culture remained negative. Recurrences of the varicella pneumonia suggested that a maintenance treatment was required in this deeply immunocompromised patient."

Progression to AIDS, however, is also associated with hypercoagulability and venous thrombosis, and may result in more comorbidities, such as reactivation of cytomegalovirus. It is therefore unknown whether active cytomegalovirus in HIV infection results in a procoagulant state or whether hypercoagulability is the result of HIV infection itself. In this cross-sectional study of 104 consecutive HIV-infected patients, active cytomegalovirus infection was associated with hypercoagulability independently of stage of HIV disease. This finding may deserve attention in preventative recommendations for use of thromboprophylaxis in HIV-infected patients."
291,0.005,1.0000,"The present article discusses CD4+ T-cell interaction and cytokine production after HIV-1 infection and progression to AIDS. On the basis of the experience of the author with biological fluids obtained from patients suspected of having AIDS and the recently available data concerning this matter, a model is proposed for the CD4+ T-cells network and CD4+ T-cells destruction during this infection. The mechanism of cellular killing involves apoptosis and preferential destruction of activated TH0/TH2-type cells. This type of cells is generated as an immune response to HIV-1 itself or to allergens and helminth infestations. The virus replicates more effectively in activated TH0/TH2-type cells and this contributes to the development of full-blown AIDS. The author has previously proposed the hypothesis of an elevation in IL-5 production during later stages of the disease and the use of eosinophilia of unknown etiology as a prognostic marker of AIDS in developing countries (Caterino-de-Araujo (1994). Immunology Today, 15: 498-499). At the present time, this proposition is confirmed and the use of eosinophilia as an indicator of a shift to a TH0/TH2-type response that predicts progression to AIDS is justified."
5579,0.005,1.0000,"The combination of host immune responses and use of antiretrovirals facilitate partial control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and result in delayed progression to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Both treatment and host immunity impose selection pressures on the highly mutable HIV-1 genome resulting in antiretroviral resistance and immune escape. Researchers have shown that antiretroviral resistance mutations can shape cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immunity by altering the epitope repertoire of HIV infected cells. Here it was discovered that an important antiretroviral resistance mutation, L90M in HIV protease, occurs at lower frequencies in hosts that harbor the B*15, B*48 or A*32 human leukocyte antigen subtypes. A likely reason is the elucidation of novel epitopes by L90M. NetMHCPan predictions reveal increased affinity of the peptide spanning the HIV protease region, PR 89-97 and PR 90-99 to HLA-B*15/B*48 and HLA-A*32 respectively due to the L90M substitution. The higher affinity could increase the chance of the epitope being presented and recognized by Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and perhaps provide additional immunological pressures in the presence of antiretroviral attenuating mutations. This evidence supports the notion that knowledge of HLA allotypes in HIV infected individuals could augment antiretroviral treatment by the elucidation of epitopes due to antiretroviral resistance mutations in HIV protease.

14748,0.005,1.0000,"A common feature of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and aging is the loss of skeletal muscle mass. Although the causes of this loss of muscle are multifactorial, there may be some shared characteristics to this loss, and therefore common strategies for its prevention or reversal. For example, loss of muscle mass early in life and early in the progression of HIV infection may result from decreased levels of physical activity. The rapid loss of skeletal muscle mass at the end of life (sometimes referred to as failure to thrive syndrome) and in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients may also have common cause: cachexia. However, it also must be pointed out that loss of skeletal muscle mass with advancing age also may result from losses of motor units, decreased rate of skeletal muscle protein synthesis, and impaired regulation of appetite. These factors have not been demonstrated to be consequences of HIV infection. The use of exercise to treat the losses of muscle size, strength, and functional capacity holds great promise. Although the losses of muscle with HIV infection may be more rapid and dramatic than those seen with aging, resistance exercise training can attenuate or arrest this loss. In elderly people, resistance exercise has been demonstrated to result in increased nitrogen balance, muscle mass and strength, functional capacity, energy requirements, and when combined with a protein calorie supplement, increased energy intake. The use of resistance exercise in HIV-infected patients may also provide similar results. This review discusses many of the changes in body composition, physiological function, and metabolism associated with aging and HIV infection. The specific effects of exercise in the elderly and in patients infected with HIV on the treatment of muscle wasting, and its consequences are also discussed."

HCV-mono-infected and HCV/HIV-co-infected patients with a known date of HCV infection (transfusion or injection drug use) and a liver biopsy were included. The FPR was defined as the ratio between the fibrosis stage (Metavir score) and the estimated length of infection in years and the result was reported as fibrosis units per year. The factors studied were gender, age at infection, consumption of alcohol, aminotransferase levels, histological activity grade, HCV genotype and viral load, CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, and the use of antiretroviral therapy. Sixty-five HCV-infected (group 1) and 53 HCV/HIV-co-infected (group 2) patients were evaluated over a period of 19 months. The mean FPR of groups 1 and 2 was 0.086 +/- 0.074 and 0.109 +/- 0.098 fibrosis units per year, respectively (P = 0.276). There was a correlation between length of HCV infection and stage of fibrosis in both groups. The age at infection, the aspartate aminotransferase level (r = 0.36) and the inflammatory activity grade were correlated with the FPR (P < 0.001). No difference in FPR was found between HCV-mono-infected and HCV/HIV-co-infected patients."

Therefore, we have assessed occupational risk for HCV infection among dentists in the New York City area. Individuals who admitted present or previous intravenous drug use or (men) who were homosexual or bisexual were excluded. Demographic, occupational, and behavioural data were recorded, and sera were tested for antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV).

Anti-HCV was found in 4 (9.3%) of 43 oral surgeons compared with 4 (0.97%) of 413 other dentists (OR 10.5, 95% CI 1.9 to 58). Seropositive dentists claimed to have treated more intravenous drug users in the week (p = 0.04) or month (p = 0.03) before the study than did seronegative dentists.

Consistent adherence and use of safe sex practices may substantially decrease the risk of HIV transmission. We sought to explore the potential association between self-reported nonadherence to ART and engaging in unsafe sexual practices capable of transmitting HIV. Using clinical and audio computer-assisted self-interview data from the prospective HIV Outpatient Study from 2007 to 2014, we assessed the frequency of self-reported ART nonadherence during the three days prior to the survey among HIV-infected persons in care and factors associated with self-reported ART nonadherence. Of 1729 patients included in this analysis (median age = 48 years, 74.3% men who have sex with men), 17% were nonadherent, 15% had a detectable VL, and 42% reported condomless anal or vaginal sex in the past six months. In multivariable analysis, self-reported nonadherence was independently associated with younger age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.8 per additional ten years, [95% CI] 0.7-1.0), non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity (aOR 1.9; 95% CI 1.4-2.6 versus white), public health insurance (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.3 compared with private), survey date in 2011-2014 versus 2007-2010 (aOR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9), CD4 cell count ≥ 500 versus < 200 cells/mm"
9535,0.005,1.0000,"Monitoring the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) is imperative for developing targeted prevention programs and evaluating their effectiveness. The authors used California counseling and testing data to estimate the temporal trend in HIV incidence among MSM in California. HIV incidence rates were retrospectively calculated among MSM who had received at least 1 HIV test at a public California counseling and testing site between 1997 and 2007 and had a prior HIV-negative test from any HIV testing source. All study subjects were weighted on the basis of the interval between the last HIV-negative test and the current HIV test to account for the right-truncation bias introduced by more frequent testers. The authors observed that the HIV incidence rate among MSM in California increased from 2.0/100 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.8, 2.2) in 1997 to 2.4/100 person-years (95% CI: 2.2, 2.6) in 2003 and then decreased to 1.9/100 person-years (95% CI: 1.7, 2.0) in 2006. Trend analyses showed that both the increase (P < 0.001) and the decrease (P < 0.01) were statistically significant. The study showed that HIV incidence among MSM in California had decreased since 2003."

Therefore, this study aimed to assess risky sexual practice and associated factors among adult HIV positive clients at Gondar University Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, 2015."
18209,0.005,1.0000,"Despite extensive prevention efforts, an estimated 21% of individuals with HIV/AIDS in the United States are unaware of their status, placing them at greater risk for spreading the virus to others. HIV treatment as prevention (TasP) is rapidly becoming an important public health strategy to reduce HIV transmission at the population level. Data for this study were collected on a sample of 11,397 HIV-positive individuals in the Ryan White system, a publicly funded system of care for HIV-positive individuals in Los Angeles County who are uninsured, in 2009 to examine two components of TasP: baseline rates and factors associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) use and viral load (VL) suppression in a publicly funded system of care. ART coverage among our sample was 90%. In multivariate analyses, those with a higher odds of having unsuppressed VL included: females compared to males (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.06, 1.47); African Americans compared to whites (AOR=1.42; 95% CI=1.24, 1.62); men who have sex with men compared to heterosexuals (AOR=1.15; 95% CI=1.00, 1.32); recent substance abusers compared to nonsubstance abusers (AOR=1.35; 95% CI=1.17, 1.55); those recently incarcerated or ever incarcerated compared to those never incarcerated (AOR=1.37; 95% CI=1.15, 1.63; and AOR=1.28; 95% CI=1.09, 1.50); and those retained in care compared to those not retained in care (AOR=1.98; 95% CI=1.76, 2.22). Understanding the key sociodemographic, geographic and behavioral factors associated with ART use as well as HIV VL suppression will be useful for informing the development and deployment of targeted programming and policies that may further enhance the implementation of the TasP approach in communities across the United States."
19779,0.005,1.0000,"Recent data suggest that the prevalence of HIV/syphilis infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China increased rapidly. This cohort study was to assess the correlates of the incident infections for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) among sexually active and HIV-negative MSM in China. A cohort of 507 HIV-seronegative MSM was recruited from November 2006 to February 2007. Sociodemographics, sexual and drug use behaviors, uptake of HIV-prevention services, and HIV, syphilis, and HBV seroconversions were assessed at 6- and 12- month follow-up. The incidence rates were 2.6 per 100 person-years for HIV, 16.9 per 100 person-years for syphilis, and 3.3 per 100 person-years for HBV. Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that syphilis infection (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-11.6) and no perceived risk of HIV infection (HR = 6.0; 95% CI: 1.6-22.7) were independently associated with HIV seroconversion. Predictors for syphilis seroconversion included less education (HR = 1.87; 95% CI: 1.1-3.3), found male sex partners through bathhouses/public washrooms/parks (HR = 2.19; 95% CI: 1.2-4.0), drank alcohol 4 or more times monthly (HR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.1-3.6), and had sexually transmitted diseases (HR = 2.65; 95% CI: 1.5-4.5). The only predictor for incident HBV seroconvension was having more male sex partners in the past 3 months (HR = 11.8; 95% CI: 1.5-90.4). Alarmingly high incidence rates of HIV, syphilis, and HBV were found among MSM concurrently with high prevalent risky behaviors and low uptakes of health care services. The findings of this study underscore the urgent needs for a comprehensive intervention strategy to curtail the rapid spread of HIV, syphilis, and HBV."
13007,0.005,1.0000,"There is a recent upsurge of interest among health care professionals regarding the risk of accidental occupational exposure to HIV virus. We evaluated knowledge of virus carriage prevalence, needlestick injuries, venepuncture practices, and glove use among paediatricians in Wales and South West Regional Health Authorities. We also attempted to evaluate hepatitis B immunisation uptake in this group. Paediatricians have traditionally been considered a low risk group in the context of accidental occupational exposure to these viruses. We targeted a four point questionnaire at 221 paediatricians. Results suggested that despite recent increasing concern about these viruses, that is reflected in the amount of medical literature recently published, and the issuing of Department of Health guidelines on venepuncture, knowledge of prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B carriage rates, and hence assessment of risk magnitude, was surprisingly poor. Safe venepuncture practices were not widely used. In the 12 months before receiving the questionnaire 55% had suffered a needlestick injury with only 10% reporting the fact. Hepatitis B immunisation uptake was highest in the junior grades (but this does not necessarily mean those at greatest risk). There were many inconsistencies between the clinicians' perceptions of risk and their practices. As the virus attains a firm hold in the heterosexual population paediatricians by virtue of the nature of venepuncture in children will almost certainly see their risk of acquiring HIV/hepatis B viruses secondary to accidental occupational exposure increase over the next decade. Without an improvement in current knowledge of carriage prevalence in high risk areas and alteration in venepuncture practices/hepatitis B immunisation uptake some will unfortunately, though avoidably, contract these bloodborne viral infections."
19190,0.005,1.0000,"Many patients infected with HIV do not achieve or maintain virologic suppression below levels of detection while on potent combination antiretroviral therapy. The likelihood of emergence of incident mutations conferring reduced antiretroviral drug susceptibility was estimated among patients maintained on a stable regimen with ongoing detectable plasma HIV RNA levels. Ninety-eight HIV-infected patients were identified who had 2 genotypic antiretroviral resistance tests available. Poisson log-linear regression models were used to identify predictors and estimate incidence rates of number of acquired antiretroviral drug resistance mutations per person-year. At the 1st resistance test, 88% of patients had evidence of at least 1 mutation. Sixty percent of patients acquired at least 1 new mutation during a median of 9.3 months between consecutive resistance tests, with an incidence rate of 1.61 acquired mutations per person-year (95% CI: 1.36-1.90). Predictors of resistance evolution included average plasma HIV RNA level, HIV RNA slope, and number of mutations detected at the 1st resistance test. The likelihood of acquiring drug resistance mutations while remaining on potent combination antiretroviral therapy that does not confer complete suppression of HIV replication is relatively low and depends on the level of viral replication and prior resistance."
18294,0.005,1.0000,"Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), the first nucleotidic inhibitor of HIV reverse transcription, became available in 2001. It has been extensively used worldwide and is now the most prescribed antiretroviral (ARV) drug. Its high antiviral activity and favorable metabolic profile are responsible for its success. Furthermore, TDF has been associated with other ARVs to form new combined antiretroviral treatments in only one tablet once-a-day, which increases treatment adherence. Fears of potential nephrotoxicity that tenofovir would have in common with two other drugs from the same family (adefovir, used to treat hepatitis B, and cidofovir, used to treat cytomegalovirus infections) were alleviated by the early clinical trials. Yet, in 2001, the first case of TDF-induced acute nephrotoxicity was published. Numerous cases have been published since then, and it is now established that TDF presents a tubular toxicity risk. Some facilitating factors have been identified, such as co-prescription of didanosine or boosted protease inhibitor, preexisting CKD, low body weight, and associated diabetes mellitus. Conversely, whether TDF is nephrotoxic in the long term is a highly debated question. Some studies suggest a decreased GFR when TDF is prescribed for a long period, while others indicate that TDF is safe for the kidneys even after many years of use. Here we review the differences in patient characteristics, study designs, and measured outcomes that can possibly explain these conflicting findings. We conclude with rational recommendation for appropriate TDF prescription. "
9467,0.005,1.0000,"Approximately 287,000 individuals in the USA are coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C. Recently, new hepatitis C regimens have become available, increasing rates of sustained virologic response in the monoinfected, with studies evaluating their success in the coinfected under way. Previous investigators estimated eligibility for hepatitis C therapy among the coinfected patients, but all had significant methodological limitations. Our study is the first to use a multi-year, statewide, population-based sample to estimate treatment eligibility, and the first to estimate eligibility in the setting of an interferon-free regimen. In a population-based sample of 161 patients infected with HIV and hepatitis C living in Oregon during 2007-2010, 21% were eligible for hepatitis C therapy. Despite the anticipation surrounding an interferon-sparing regimen, eligibility assuming an interferon-free regimen increased only to 26%, largely due to multiple simultaneous contraindications. Obesity was described for the first time as being associated with decreased eligibility (OR: 0.11). Active alcohol abuse was the most common contraindication (24%); uncontrolled mental health (22%), recent injection drug use (21%), poor antiretroviral adherence (22%), and infection (21%) were also common excluding conditions. When active drug or alcohol abuse was excluded as contraindications to therapy, the eligibility rate was 34%, a 62% increase. Assuming an interferon-free regimen and the exclusion of active drug or alcohol abuse as contraindications to therapy, the eligibility rate increased to 42%. Despite the availability of direct-acting anti-viral regimens, eligibility rates in HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection are modest. Many factors precluding hepatitis C therapy are reversible, and targeted interventions could result in increased eligibility. "
15522,0.005,1.0000,"All persons at risk for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, including men who have sex with men, those with multiple heterosexual contacts, abusers of illegal injection drugs, and persons frequently exposed to blood and blood products, are also at high risk for hepatitis A virus (HAV) and acute and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. HIV can prolong the duration and increase the level of HAV viremia and augment HAV-related liver abnormalities. HIV also magnifies HBV viremia and the risk of HBV reactivation, chronic active HBV infection, cirrhosis, and death. Because of these concerns, hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for all HIV-positive/HAV seronegative persons, with 2 standard doses given 6 to 12 months apart. Immune response to hepatitis A vaccines is excellent, even in moderately immune-suppressed individuals. Hepatitis B vaccination is also recommended for all HIV-positive persons lacking prior immunity. However, immune reactivity to hepatitis B vaccines is frequently suboptimal in terms of patients' rate of response, antibody titer, and durability. Relatively high CD4+ T-cell counts (> or =500/mm3) and low levels of HIV viremia (<1,000 RNA genome copies/mL plasma) are necessary to ensure adequate hepatitis B vaccine response. Higher hepatitis B vaccine doses, prolongation of the vaccination schedule, or both, as prescribed for many patients with non-HIV-related immune deficiencies, may be considered initially. Revaccination should be instituted if postvaccination titers of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen are <10 mIU/mL (<10 IU/L). Nonresponders may also react to a subsequent vaccine course if CD4+ T-cell counts rise to 500/mm3 following institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy; vaccine adjuvant trials are under way. Universal, age-based immunization of all young and middle-aged adults appears to be the most comprehensive way of protecting all populations who are at high risk."
13850,0.005,1.0000,"The success of combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection has generated interest in mechanisms by which the virus can persist in the body despite the presence of drugs that effectively inhibit key steps in the virus life cycle. It is becoming clear that viral reservoirs established early in the infection not only prevent sterilizing immunity but also represent a major obstacle to curing the infection with the potent antiretroviral drugs currently in use. Mechanisms of viral persistence are best considered in the context of the dynamics of viral replication in vivo. Virus production in infected individuals is largely the result of a dynamic process involving continuous rounds of de novo infection of and replication in activated CD4(+) T cells with rapid turnover of both free virus and virus-producing cells. This process is largely, but not completely, interrupted by effective antiretroviral therapy. After a few months of therapy, plasma virus levels become undetectable in many patients. Analysis of viral decay rates initially suggested that eradication of the infection might be possible. However, there are several potential cellular and anatomical reservoirs for HIV-1 that may contribute to long-term persistence of HIV-1. These include infected cell in the central nervous system and the male urogenital tract. However, the most worrisome reservoir consists of latently infected resting memory CD4(+) T cells carrying integrated HIV-1 DNA. Definitive demonstration of the presence of this form of latency required development of methods for isolating extremely pure populations of resting CD4(+) T cells and for demonstrating that a small fraction of these cells contain integrated HIV-1 DNA that is competent for replication if the cells undergo antigen-driven activation. Most of the latent virus in resting CD4(+) T cells is found in cells of the memory phenotype. The half-life of this latent reservoir is extremely long (44 months). At this rate, eradication of this reservoir would require over 60 years of treatment. Thus, latently infected resting CD4(+) T cells provide a mechanism for life-long persistence of replication-competent forms of HIV-1, rendering unrealistic hopes of virus eradication with current antiretroviral regimens. The extraordinary stability of the reservoir may reflect gradual reseeding by a very low level of ongoing viral replication and/or mechanisms that contribute to the intrinsic stability of the memory T cell compartment. Given the substantial long-term toxicities of current combination therapy regimens, novel approaches to eradicating this latent reservoir are urgently needed."
2833,0.005,1.0000,"There is increasing evidence that a wider range of lymphoid cell types other than CD4(+) T helper lymphocytes are infected with HIV-1 in vivo, including CD8 lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and reticulodendritic cells. Each potentially contributes to the reservoir of infected cells that resist antiviral treatment and to the impairment of immune responses in AIDS. By quantitative PCR for HIV proviral sequences we have now obtained evidence for substantial infection of gammadelta lymphocytes, contributing 3-45% of the proviral load in peripheral blood. A large proportion of gammadelta lymphocytes constitutively expressed the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, with evidence for marked up-regulation of CD8 in samples from HIV-infected individuals, corresponding to an activated phenotype. That gammadelta lymphocytes might be susceptible to HIV infection was investigated using in vitro infectivity assays of recombinant HIV-expressing green fluorescent protein, followed by flow cytometry. gammadelta, CD4, and CD8 lymphocytes were each productively infected, with gammadelta lymphocytes showing the greatest susceptibility. For each cell type, blocking assays with an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody indicated that entry was CD4-dependent."
16945,0.005,1.0000,"Human genetic variation contributes to differences in susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. To search for novel host resistance factors, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in hemophilia patients highly exposed to potentially contaminated factor VIII infusions. Individuals with hemophilia A and a documented history of factor VIII infusions before the introduction of viral inactivation procedures (1979-1984) were recruited from 36 hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs), and their genome-wide genetic variants were compared with those from matched HIV-infected individuals. Homozygous carriers of known CCR5 resistance mutations were excluded. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and inferred copy number variants (CNVs) were tested using logistic regression. In addition, we performed a pathway enrichment analysis, a heritability analysis, and a search for epistatic interactions with CCR5 Δ32 heterozygosity. A total of 560 HIV-uninfected cases were recruited: 36 (6.4%) were homozygous for CCR5 Δ32 or m303. After quality control and SNP imputation, we tested 1 081 435 SNPs and 3686 CNVs for association with HIV-1 serostatus in 431 cases and 765 HIV-infected controls. No SNP or CNV reached genome-wide significance. The additional analyses did not reveal any strong genetic effect. Highly exposed, yet uninfected hemophiliacs form an ideal study group to investigate host resistance factors. Using a genome-wide approach, we did not detect any significant associations between SNPs and HIV-1 susceptibility, indicating that common genetic variants of major effect are unlikely to explain the observed resistance phenotype in this population."
10530,0.005,1.0000,"APOBEC3G (A3G), a member of cytidine deaminase family, has potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activity. It has been demonstrated that alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) can significantly enhance the expression of A3G in human primary resting CD4(+) T-cells, macrophages and primary hepatocytes, subsequently decreasing their viral susceptibility. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are key effectors in innate host immunity, mediating adaptive immune responses and stimulating IFN-alpha production in reaction to various stimuli. In this report, we demonstrate that IFN-alpha, either exogenously added to- or endogenously secreted by pDCs, can enhance the expression of A3G and its family members such as A3A, A3C and A3F. We have also shown that IFN-alpha can inhibit HIV-1 expression in pDCs. This inhibitory effect could be countered by addition of an A3G-specific short interfering RNA, indicating that IFN-alpha-induced A3G plays a key role in mediating pDCs response to HIV-1. Given the central role played by pDCs in orchestrating the IFN-alpha/A3G intercellular network and intracellular signal pathway, our data indicate that pDCs themselves are also protected by an IFN-alpha/A3G-mediated innate immunity barrier from HIV-1 infection."
18510,0.005,1.0000,"The risk of disease associated with persistent virus infections such as HIV-I, hepatitis B and C, and human T-lymphotropic virus-I (HTLV-I) is strongly determined by the virus load. However, it is not known whether a persistent class I HLA-restricted antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response reduces viral load and is therefore beneficial or causes tissue damage and contributes to disease pathogenesis. HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM/TSP) patients have a high virus load compared with asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers. We hypothesized that HLA alleles control HTLV-I provirus load and thus influence susceptibility to HAM/TSP. Here we show that, after infection with HTLV-I, the class I allele HLA-A*02 halves the odds of HAM/TSP (P < 0.0001), preventing 28% of potential cases of HAM/TSP. Furthermore, HLA-A*02(+) healthy HTLV-I carriers have a proviral load one-third that (P = 0.014) of HLA-A*02(-) HTLV-I carriers. An association of HLA-DRB1*0101 with disease susceptibility also was identified, which doubled the odds of HAM/TSP in the absence of the protective effect of HLA-A*02. These data have implications for other persistent virus infections in which virus load is associated with prognosis and imply that an efficient antiviral CTL response can reduce virus load and so prevent disease in persistent virus infections."
17639,0.005,1.0000,"Suppression of viral replication is followed by increases in CD4+ lymphocytes, and this has been shown to result in decreased susceptibility to opportunists after initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However, clinical aggravations after the initiation of HAART have been thought to be due to the restored ability to mount an inflammatory response, or the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The degree of IRIS observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients following initiation of HAART is variable. This prospective study was aimed at determining the proportion of IRIS and the pattern of opportunistic infections among 186 HIV/AIDS patients receiving HAART between December 2006 and July 2007 at Zewditu Memorial Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The proportion of IRIS was 17.2% (32/186). The mean number of days of IRIS occurrence for each disease ranged from 26 to 122 days with a mean of 80. Opportunistic diseases associated with IRIS were tuberculosis (68.8%, 22/32), herpes zoster rash (12.5%, 4/32), cryptococcosis (9.4%, 3/32), toxoplasmosis (6.3%, 2/32) and bacterial pneumonia (3.1%, 1/32). Compared to baseline readings there were significant increases in CD4 count, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels while hemoglobin values decreased during the development of IRIS. In summary, the proportion of IRIS and the pattern of opportunistic infections in HAART-treated patients in Ethiopia mirrored those reported in other countries. Further prospective surveys on epidemiological, immunological, microbial and clinical studies are imperative to assess the proportion and pattern of IRIS and effect of HAART in Ethiopia."
14629,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced immunodeficiency is characterized by progressive loss of CD4(+) T cells associated with functional abnormalities of the surviving lymphocytes. Increased susceptibility to apoptosis and loss of proper cell cycle control can be observed in lymphocytes from HIV-infected individuals and may contribute to the lymphocyte dysfunction of AIDS patients. To better understand the relation between T-cell activation, apoptosis, and cell cycle perturbation, we studied the effect of exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2) administration on the intracellular turnover of phase-dependent proteins. Circulating T cells from HIV-infected patients display a marked discrepancy between a metabolic profile typical of G(0) and a pattern of expression of phase-dependent proteins that indicates a more-advanced position within the cell cycle. This discrepancy is enhanced by in vitro activation with ConA and ultimately results in a marked increase of apoptotic events. Conversely, treatment of lymphocytes with IL-2 alone restores the phase-specific pattern of expression of cell cycle-dependent proteins and is associated with low levels of apoptosis. Interestingly, exogenous IL-2 administration normalizes the overall intracellular protein turnover, as measured by protein synthesis, half-life of newly synthesised proteins, and total protein ubiquitination, thus providing a possible explanation for the effect of IL-2 on the intracellular kinetics of cell cycle-dependent proteins. The beneficial effect of IL-2 administration is consistent with the possibility of defective IL-2 function in vivo, which is confirmed by the observation that lymphocytes from HIV-infected patients show abnormal endogenous IL-2 paracrine/autocrine function upon in vitro mitogen stimulation. Overall these results confirm that perturbation of cell cycle control contributes to HIV-related lymphocyte dysfunction and, by showing that IL-2 administration can revert this perturbation, suggest a new mechanism of action of IL-2 therapy in HIV-infected patients."
11114,0.005,1.0000,"It is generally believed that CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a critical role in limiting the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and in determining the outcome of the infection, and this effect may partly depend on which HIV product is preferentially targeted. To address the correlation between HIV-1-specific CTL responses and virus replication in a cohort of former plasma donors (FPDs), 143 antiretroviral therapy naive FPDs infected with HIV-1 clade B' strains were assessed for HIV-1-specific CTL responses with an IFN-γ Elispot assay at single peptide level by using overlapping peptides (OLPs) covering the whole consensus clade B proteome. By using a Spearman's rank correlation analysis, we found that the proportion of Gag-specific CTL responses among the total virus-specific CTL activity was inversely correlated with viral loads while being positively correlated to CD4 counts, as opposed to Pol- and Env-specific responses that were associated with increased viral loads and decreased CD4 counts. In addition, Vpr-specifc CTL responses showed a similar protective effect with Gag responses, but with a much lower frequency of recognition. Significantly, we also observed an association between HLA-A*30/B*13/Cw*06 haplotype and lower viral loads that was probably due to restricted Gag-specific CTL responses. Thus, our data demonstrate the prominent role of Gag-specific CTL responses in disease control. The advantage of HLA-A*30/B*13/Cw*06 haplotype in viral control may be associated with the contribution of Gag-specific CTL responses in the studied individuals."
13858,0.005,1.0000,"The effect of infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV patient group), infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB patient group), and coinfection with both of these organisms (HIV/TB patient group) on the expression of CD88 on polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) was determined by using a receptor-specific monoclonal antibody and flow cytometry. A significant reduction in the fluorescence intensity of CD88 on PMNL was observed in the HIV and HIV/TB groups, compared with both the healthy donor (HD) and TB groups. Furthermore, when degranulation of PMNL was induced by ligation of CD88 by complement 5a (C5a), a large proportion of patients in the HIV and the HIV/TB groups was found to have reciprocal degranulation responses. Patients in the 2 HIV groups also were found to have significantly reduced C5a-induced chemotactic responses and significantly elevated peripheral levels of C5a des Arg, compared with the HD and TB groups. These differences may contribute to the increased susceptibility of HIV-1-infected individuals to secondary microbial infections."
13103,0.005,1.0000,"Despite a high antiviral efficacy, the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in clinical practice is often impaired by the long-term toxicity of antiretroviral treatment, the increased rate of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) drug resistance in treated patients and the cost of therapies, so that possible interruption of HAART has to be considered as part of the current clinical practice. However, this strategy is usually followed by a rapid viral rebound with a substantial loss of CD4 T lymphocytes because the HIV suppression with HAART does not result in reconstitution of the HIV-specific immune response. Structured treatment interruption (STI) has already been investigated in HIV-infected subjects with well-controlled viral replication (initiating treatment during primary or chronic HIV infection) and in those with multiple treatment failures. A clear benefit of STI in patients with chronic infection remains controversial and these benefits are more often observed in patients starting treatment during primary HIV infection."
11278,0.005,1.0000,"The murine model of acquired immunodeficiency disease was used to evaluate both the antiretroviral and antiherpetic activities of the acyclic nucleotide analog 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA). The antiretroviral activity of PMEA was compared with that of azidothymidine (AZT) in mice receiving the drug either immediately after infection or at late times in disease progression. Both AZT (oral, 30 mg/kg) and PMEA (parenteral, 25 and 5 mg/kg) were effective in slowing the development of disease when administered daily beginning on the day of infection. In contrast, neither drug alone was effective in modifying disease outcome when administered several weeks after viral infection. Human recombinant alpha interferon (rhuIFN alpha-B/D at 5 x 10(7) U/kg) was also ineffective when administered late in the course of disease. However, when administered in combination, both alpha interferon and PMEA (25 mg/kg) were able to suppress disease progression even when treatment was initiated as late as 3 weeks postinfection. Mice that were immunocompromised due to LP-BM5 virus infection were highly susceptible to acute (lethal) infection with herpes simplex virus type 1, whereas their immunocompetent littermates were not. PMEA was as effective as acyclovir in the treatment of opportunistic herpes simplex virus type 1 infections in LP-BM5 virus-infected mice. Thus, like AZT, PMEA was effective against retrovirus infection, and, like acyclovir, PMEA was effective against herpes simplex virus type 1 infection. This gives PMEA the unique potential of being useful in the treatment of opportunistic herpes simplex virus infections as well as the underlying retroviral disease."
8622,0.005,1.0000,"Potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically improved the prognosis of HIV-1-infected individuals. However, 10% to 30% of patients in Western countries still present late for care, when CD4 T cells are below 200 cells/mm(3) and symptomatic HIV disease has occurred. Clinical considerations for advanced HIV disease are paramount as morbidity and mortality are directly correlated with a low initial CD4 T cell count, which is commonly associated with the simultaneous occurrence of co-morbidities, particularly opportunistic infections. Upon start of ART, the clinical entity of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome may occur and, in this context, raise the question of early versus delayed ART in patients treated for opportunistic infections. Recent data clearly indicate that an earlier start of ART is warranted in this latter situation. Guidelines for specific antiretroviral treatment for late-presenting patients are lacking. Knowledge about drug-drug interactions and co-morbidities should guide treatment choices and influence the clinical management and monitoring of drug-related side effects and interactions. Importantly, the outlook of patients who present late is very much dependent upon the initial response to ART. Nevertheless, even if optimal response to treatment has been achieved, long-term prognosis may be impaired in patients who initially presented with advanced HIV disease. We encourage physicians to perform HIV testing more frequently in order to detect HIV-infected individuals in time."
3224,0.005,1.0000,"Large-cohort studies in North America, Europe, and Thailand have shown that zidovudine/azidothymidine (AZT) monotherapy, given at the late stages of pregnancy, is of proven benefit in reducing mother-to-infant HIV transmission by 51% to 68%. AZT monotherapy will not be of long-term benefit for mothers because no single drug can counteract viral infection; benefits to babies will be short-lived if HIV-1 is acquired through breastfeeding after birth. Unfortunately, ongoing mutation of HIV under conditions of drug pressure allows for the evolution and selection of AZT-resistant viruses. Emergence of AZT-resistant variants in pregnant mothers (7-29%) and their infected offspring (5-21%) has been described in several studies. Drug resistance arises more frequently in those mothers who received AZT therapy before pregnancy. Recent advances in combination chemotherapy may provide alternative strategies in prevention of vertical transmission and drug resistance. Genotypic screening of the HIV-1 isolated from pregnant mothers may provide rational modifications in antiretroviral (ARV) strategies to circumvent vertical HIV transmission. This may be of advantage for resource-rich nations but not for underdeveloped nations with limited access to ARVs. Public health programs are vital to have an impact on the tragic pandemic of pediatric AIDS."
6017,0.005,1.0000,"Coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is not uncommon in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and patients with HIV-HBV coinfection are at high risk for progression of liver disease. Current guidelines regarding the treatment of HIV infection recommend that patients who are coinfected with HIV and HBV receive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with activity against hepatitis B. While HIV-HBV coinfected patients often experience liver enzyme elevations after starting antiretroviral therapy, acute liver failure (ALF) is rare and typically occurs with older antiretroviral agents with known potential for hepatotoxicity. We describe two cases of fatal ALF in the setting of HIV-HBV coinfection after initiation of HAART. These cases occurred despite treatment with antiretrovirals that have activity against HBV and highlight the challenges in distinguishing drug hepatotoxicity and HBV immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. HIV-HBV coinfected patients should be monitored closely when initiating HAART, even when treatment includes agents that have activity against HBV."
3458,0.005,1.0000,"A case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia is described, in which improvement occurred soon after starting antiviral therapy. A 20-y-old black female with HIV infection (CD4+ count 228 x 10(6) cells and plasma viral load 379,670 copies/ml) showed radiological signs of reticulonodular infiltrates of the lungs and pulmonary functional tests indicative of a severe restrictive syndrome. Bronchoalveolar and blood cultures yielded no organism and transbronchial biopsy disclosed findings consistent with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia. After 4 weeks on triple HIV combination therapy, she was well and respiratory tests had normalized. Six months later, a computed tomographic scan of the chest showed only residual alterations. Despite a good sirological response to treatment, no significant immune recovery occurred over a 2 y follow-up."
12480,0.005,1.0000,"A study was designed to determine the effects of congenital infection with the Rous-associated virus-1 (RAV-1) on the immune function chickens during the early and late tumorigenic stages of infection. In another experiment, the effects of niridazole on the immune competence and the tumor incidence in chickens congenitally infected with RAV-1 were studied. Lymphocyte stimulation by phytohemagglutinin, the phytohemagglutinin skin test, the response to immunization with sheep erythrocytes and Brucella abortus, and histological evaluation of lymphoid organs were used to determine the immune competence in normal and infected chickens. Results indicated that both B- and T-cell immune functions during the early and late stages of RAV-1 infection were comparable to those of normal uninfected chickens. Administration of niridazole to congenitally infected chickens at 5 weeks of age for 7 or 21 days had no effect on the T-cell-mediated immunity; however, administration of the drug for 21 days eliminated lymphoma development. Unlike infection with other oncogenic viruses such as those causing Marek's disease and reticuloendotheliosis, infection with RAV-1 caused no detectable immunodepression during the early and late stages of infection."
18519,0.005,1.0000,"To learn about the patterns of use and the effectiveness of zidovudine therapy in clinical practice, we conducted an observational cohort study of 86 patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. All patients were followed up for at least 6 months after starting zidovudine (AZT) therapy. Of the 86 patients, 78 (91%) initially received full-dosage zidovudine (1200 mg/d), and eight received a reduced dosage (600 mg/d). During follow-up, the number able to maintain full-dosage zidovudine therapy decreased to 54 (63%) at 3 months and 40 (47%) at 6 months. Thirty-five patients required dosage reductions that lasted at least 7 days and were not preceded by an adverse outcome (death or opportunistic infection). Overall, adverse outcomes occurred for nine (26%) of those with dosage reductions compared with 22 (43%) of 51 patients with no previous dosage change. Even after adjusting for baseline cytopenias and the time of the dosage reductions, adverse outcomes did not occur significantly more often in patients who received reductions in their zidovudine dosage. Our results indicate that full-dosage zidovudine therapy cannot be maintained for most patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus, but that clinicians need not be pessimistic about treatment outcomes when dosage reductions are needed."
11737,0.005,1.0000,"Two hundred eighty-one patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or advanced AIDS-related complex were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of orally administered zidovudine (azidothymidine or AZT). Significant clinical benefits and adverse experiences have been reported from this trial. Because neuropsychiatric dysfunction is often associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a brief affective and neuropsychological examination was administered over 16 weeks of the trial to evaluate any changes in neuropsychological function that occurred with drug administration. Patients receiving zidovudine, particularly those with AIDS, showed improved cognition as compared with patients receiving placebo. There were no changes in affective symptoms. The zidovudine recipients also had a statistically significant reduction in the intensity of symptomatic distress during the trial that may account in part for the observed cognitive changes. Some improvement in various cognitive measures was also seen in patients with AIDS-related complex. The results of this study suggest HIV-associated cognitive abnormalities may be partially ameliorated after the administration of zidovudine."
2501,0.005,1.0000,"Nonoptimal liver grafts, and among them organs from anti-HBc+ donors, are increasingly used for liver transplantation. In this retrospective study including 1065 adult liver transplantations performed between 1977 and 2012, we analyzed long-term patient and graft survival and occurrence of HBV infection. A total of 52 (5.1%) patients received an anti-HBc+ graft. The 10-year graft and patient survival of these recipients were 50.9% and 59.0% compared to 72.0% and 76.5% (P = 0.001; P = 0.004) of patients receiving anti-HBc- grafts, respectively. Cox regression model showed that high urgency allocation (P = 0.003), recipient age (P = 0.027), anti-HCV+ recipients (P = 0.005), and anti-HBc+ organs (P = 0.048) are associated with decreased graft survival. Thirteen of 52 (25.0%) patients receiving anti-HBc+ grafts developed post-transplant HBV infection within a mean of 2.8 years. In this study, antiviral prophylaxis did not have significant impact on HBV infection, but long-term survival (P = 0.008). Development of post-transplant HBV infection did not affect adjusted 10-year graft survival (100% vs. 100%; P = 1). Anti-HBc+ liver grafts can be transplanted with reasonable but inferior long-term patient and graft survival. The inferior graft survival is not, however, related with post-transplant HBV infection as long as early diagnosis and treatment take place. "
7925,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity has historically been an absolute contraindication for solid organ transplantation. However, the successful application of HAART (highly active anti-retroviral therapy) drug regimens has greatly prolonged the life expectancy of HIV-positive patients. Therefore, it has become appropriate to consider this patient population for transplantation. HIV positive transplants are being performed around the country in controlled settings, usually as part of a research protocol. The aim of our study is to describe the Louisiana experience with organ transplantation into HIV-positive patients. We identified seven HIV-positive patients who underwent kidney or kidney/pancreas transplantation at our center between 2007 and 2010. We performed a retrospective chart review to ascertain graft function, as well as virologic and immunologic status post-transplant. Renal function (glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine concentrations) improved in all subjects post-transplant, and six of seven (85.8%) subjects remained virologically suppressed with no progression to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Overall, two-year graft and patient survival rates were 85.5%. HIV seropositive End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients represent a new population of patients that can be successfully transplanted. This offers a new dimension in care for successful HAART therapy to prolong the life of HIV-infected patients."
16878,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection after liver transplantation (LT) may lead to severe and rapidly progressive graft failure. Antiviral treatment may be of benefit in selected patients with recurrent hepatitis B post-LT. The aim of this prospective open-label study is to determine the safety and efficacy of lamivudine in 33 liver transplant recipients with active HBV infection. The median time from LT to study enrollment was 51 months, all patients were hepatitis B surface antigen positive, and 75% and 94% of subjects had detectable hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and HBV DNA at entry, respectively. The median duration of lamivudine treatment on study was 85 weeks, during which time median HBV DNA levels became undetectable by 16 weeks and 9% of patients lost previously detectable HBeAg. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels improved in most patients and normalized in 27% of patients with elevated values pretreatment. Serum bilirubin and albumin levels significantly improved in patients with abnormal values at entry (P <.05). Virological breakthrough was detected in 13 subjects after a median of 61 weeks of lamivudine treatment and was confirmed to be caused by YMDD mutants in all patients tested. None of the patients with virological breakthrough showed a complete loss of clinical response to lamivudine. Serum ALT and bilirubin levels in patients with and without virological breakthrough were not significantly different at last study follow-up. Study results show that lamivudine is safe and effective in liver transplant recipients with recurrent hepatitis B. However, the high rate of virological breakthrough with prolonged therapy indicates the need for further studies of combination antiviral therapy in this patient population. Our results and others further establish the improving long-term outcomes with LT for patients with hepatitis B through advances in prevention of reinfection, as well as the availability of safe and effective antiviral therapies to treat patients with HBV recurrence."
14656,0.005,1.0000,"The prerequisite for an 'undetectable' HIV viral load has restricted access to transplantation for HIV-infected kidney recipients. However, HCV-infected recipients, owing to the historic limitations of HCV therapy in patients with renal disease, are commonly viremic at transplant and have universal access. To compare the effect of HIV, HCV, and HIV/HCV coinfection on kidney transplant patient and allograft outcomes, we performed a retrospective study of kidney recipients transplanted from January 1996 through December 2013. In multivariable analysis, patient (hazard ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.66-1.24) and allograft survival (0.60, 40-0.88) in 492 HIV patients did not differ significantly from the 117,791 patient-uninfected reference group. This was superior to outcomes in both the 5605 patient HCV group for death (1.44, 1.33-1.56) and graft loss (1.43, 1.31-1.56), as well as the 147 patient HIV/HCV coinfected group for death (2.26, 1.45-3.52) and graft loss (2.59, 1.60-4.19). HIV infection did not adversely affect recipient or allograft survival and was associated with superior outcomes compared with both HCV infection and HIV/HCV coinfection in this population. Thus, pretransplant viral eradication and/or immediate posttransplant eradication should be studied as potential strategies to improve posttransplant outcomes in HCV-infected kidney recipients. "
207,0.005,1.0000,"The impact of hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) on patient survival after kidney transplantation is controversial. The aims of this study were (1) to assess the independent prognostic values of HBsAg and anti-HCV in a large renal transplant population, (2) to compare infected patients with noninfected patients matched for factors possibly associated with graft and patient survival, and (3) to assess the prognostic value of biopsy-proven cirrhosis. Eight hundred thirty-four transplanted patients were included: 128 with positive HBsAg (group I), 216 with positive anti-HCV (group II), and 490 without serological markers of HBV and HCV (group III). Fifteen percent and 29% of patients were HBsAg-positive and anti-HCV-positive, respectively. Ten-year survivals of group I (55 +/- 6%) and group II (65 +/- 5%) were significantly lower than survival of group III (80 +/- 3%, P <.001). At 10 years, among overall patients with HCV screening (n = 834), four variables had independent prognostic values in patient survival: age at transplantation (P <.0001), year of transplantation (P =.02), biopsy-proven cirrhosis (P =.03), and presence of HCV antibodies (P =.02). In the case control study, comparison of infected patients with their matched control patients showed that age at transplantation (P <.05), HBsAg (P =.005), and anti-HCV (P =.005) were independent prognostic factors. HCV, biopsy-proven cirrhosis, and age are independent prognostic factors of 10-year survival in patients with kidney grafts. The case-control study showed that anti-HCV and HBsAg were independently associated with patient and graft survivals. In infected patients, a routine liver histological analysis would improve selection of patients for renal transplantation."
19899,0.005,1.0000,"Substance abuse treatment is associated with decreases in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behavior and can improve HIV outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine factors associated with substance abuse treatment utilization, including patient-provider discussions of substance use issues. We surveyed 951 HIV-infected adults receiving care at 14 HIV Research Network primary care sites regarding drug and alcohol use, substance abuse treatment, and provider discussions of substance use issues. Although 71% reported substance use, only 24% reported receiving substance abuse treatment and less than half reported discussing substance use issues with their HIV providers. In adjusted logistic regression models, receipt of substance abuse treatment was associated with patient-provider discussions. Patient-provider discussions of substance use issues were associated with current drug use, hazardous or binge drinking, and Black race or ethnicity, though substance use was comparable between Blacks and Whites. These data suggest potential opportunities for improving engagement in substance abuse treatment services."
19871,0.005,1.0000,"Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the form of triple combinations of drugs including protease inhibitors can reduce the plasma viral load of some HIV-1-infected individuals to undetectable levels, it is unclear what the effects of these regimens are on latently infected CD4+ T cells and what role these cells play in the persistence of HIV-1 infection in individuals receiving such treatment. The present study demonstrates that highly purified CD4+ T cells from 13 of 13 patients receiving HAART with an average treatment time of 10 months and with undetectable (<500 copies HIV RNA/ml) plasma viremia by a commonly used bDNA assay carried integrated proviral DNA and were capable of producing infectious virus upon cellular activation in vitro. Phenotypic analysis of HIV-1 produced by activation of latently infected CD4+ T cells revealed the presence in some patients of syncytium-inducing virus. In addition, the presence of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA in infected resting CD4+ T cells from patients receiving HAART, even those with undetectable plasma viremia, suggests persistent active virus replication in vivo."
19101,0.005,1.0000,"Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) recipients are immunosuppressed and are at risk for contracting severe infections. Recently, adoptive transfer of immunity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) was documented in BMT recipients receiving bone marrow from 'naturally' HBV-infected individuals who recovered spontaneously, or those transplanted with bone marrow cells obtained from actively immunized donors. Furthermore, reconstitution of the immune system in a BMT recipient who was a hepatitis surface antigen (HBsAg)+/HBV DNA+ carrier with HBV immune bone marrow cells led to clearance of the replicating virus, presumably through adoptive cell-mediated immunotherapy. We report three cases of induction of immunity to HBV by selective adoptive transfer by i.v. injection of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) obtained from BMT donors who were actively immunized against HBV after harvesting of bone marrow. All three BMT recipients developed anti-HBs antibodies. In one BMT case in whom antibodies to HBsAg developed following adoptive transfer of immune PBL, a mild booster effect was documented in the BMT recipient upon immunization with a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. The two remaining patients lost their antibodies to HBsAg in association with relapse of leukaemia. This immune manipulation may open the door to evaluation of adoptive transfer of immunity to HBV through selective transplantation of HBV immune lymphocytes in selected patients such as those with persistent HBV infection, as well as liver transplant recipients who require protection of the graft against HBV re-infection."
19329,0.005,1.0000,"Worldwide, an increasing number of women use oral or injectable hormonal contraceptives. However, inadequate information is available to aid women and health care professionals in weighing the potential risks of hormonal contraceptive use in individuals living with HIV-1 or at high risk of infection. Numerous epidemiological studies and challenge studies in a rhesus macaque model suggest that progesterone-based contraceptives increase the risk of HIV-1 infection in humans and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in macaques, accelerate disease progression, and increase viral shedding in the genital tract. However, because several other studies in humans have not observed any effect of exogenously administered progesterone on HIV-1 acquisition and disease progression, the issue continues to be a topic of intense research and ongoing discussion. In contrast to progesterone, systemic or intravaginal treatment with estrogen efficiently protects female rhesus macaques against the transmission of SIV, likely by enhancing the natural protective properties of the lower genital tract mucosal tissue. Although the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the effect of sex steroid hormones on HIV-1 and SIV acquisition and disease progression are not well understood, progesterone and estrogen are known to regulate a number of immune mechanisms that may exert an effect on retroviral infection. This review summarizes current knowledge of the effects of various types of sex steroid hormones on immune processes involved in the biology of HIV-1 infection."
8037,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been the subject of intense research and clinical investigations due to its worldwide prevalence and major role in chronic liver disease. Like most RNA viruses, HCV circulates in vivo as a complex population of different but closely related viral variants, commonly referred to as a quasispecies. Recent studies suggest that ribavirin might exert an antiviral effect against HCV through both mutagenic effect and an impairment of RNA replication. The introduction of alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) plus ribavirin combination therapy was an important breakthrough in the treatment of chronic HCV infection. However, the rate of sustained virological response is still unsatisfactory, particularly in patients infected with HCV genotype 1. Viral persistence, a hallmark of HCV, may result from a dynamic control of the host response by the virus. In children with chronic HCV infection, the viral population is initially highly homogeneous, but diversifies during prolonged infection which seems to be a common event during chronic hepatitis C in childhood. Coinfection of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) patients by HCV can complicate the treatment of these patients with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HIV coinfection is associated with a decrease of HCV quasispecies variability, which appears to be reversed by effective HAART."
4859,0.005,1.0000,"The recent outbreak of hepatitis C virus (HCV) at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) has highlighted the dangers of viral hepatitis. In this case, infection control and environmental contamination were the culprits, particularly, a drop of blood containing 5 million IU HCV. From a broader perspective, there has been a revolution in HCV therapy with the recent rapid evolution of short-term (12 weeks) safe, all oral directly- acting antiviral (DAA) therapy leading to cure rates of 90% to 100%, even in previously difficult to treat patients with liver cirrhosis, previous treatment failure and those on immunosuppression. Consequently, treating HCV in risk groups such as renal dialysis and haemophiliacs can eliminate a pool of infected patients to prevent future outbreaks. A seroprevalence study is needed to identify a possible ""birth cohort"" effect that could aid screening. For HBV, vaccination has reduced prevalence to 3.8%, but these patients are prone to complications such as HBV flares. Since 2014, 13 patients developed liver failure and were listed for liver transplantation at National University Hospital (NUH) but 6 died beforehand. This avoidable catastrophe is due to undiagnosed HBV infection or patients who did not return for follow-up. Good antiviral therapy is available, but the issues are similar to HCV, identification of patients and linkage to care. A cure seems likely in the future as pharmaceutical companies are developing new agents. Singapore has joined in this initiative with a recent award of a national research translational grant to better understand the pathophysiology and the processes needed for a cure of HBV. "
16862,0.005,1.0000,"The study aim was to assess whether hepatitis C virus (HCV) was associated with painful symptoms among patients with HIV. Using data from a prospective cohort of HIV-infected adults with alcohol problems, we assessed the effects of HCV on pain that interfered with daily living and painful symptoms (muscle/joint pain, headache and peripheral neuropathy). Exploratory analyses assessed whether depressive symptoms and inflammatory cytokines mediated the relationship between HCV and pain. HCV-infected participants (n = 200) had higher odds of pain that interfered with daily living over time (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.43; 95% CI: 1.02-2.01; p = 0.04) compared to those not infected with HCV. HIV/HCV co-infected participants had higher odds of muscle or joint pain (AOR 1.45; 95% CI: 1.06-1.97; p = 0.02) and headache (AOR 1.57; 95% CI: 1.18-2.07; p<0.01). The association between HCV and peripheral neuropathy did not reach statistical significance (AOR 1.33; 95% CI: 0.96-1.85; p = 0.09). Depressive symptoms and inflammatory cytokines did not appear to mediate the relationship between HCV and pain. Adults with HIV who are also co-infected with HCV are more likely to experience pain that interfered with daily living, muscle or joint pain, and headaches compared to those not co-infected. Research is needed to explore the association between HCV infection and pain, and to determine whether HCV treatment is an effective intervention."
1820,0.005,1.0000,"Cardiovascular abnormalities were appreciated early in the epidemic of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), even before the aetiological agent, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was isolated and characterised. The aetiology and pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in HIV infection is still the subject of intense speculation, and is likely multi-factorial. HIV affects every aspect of the cardiac axis, causing pericarditis, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease and microvascular dysfunction, valvular heart disease, pulmonary vascular disease and pulmonary hypertension, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. HIV-associated vasculopathy is an increasingly recognised clinical entity, causing high morbidity and increasing mortality in southern Africa, particularly from stroke and cardiovascular disease. HIV causes disease of the vascular tree, either by a direct effect on vascular or perivascular tissue, or indirectly via immune complex-mediated mechanisms, associated opportunistic infections and malignancies. As a result, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may have an important role in controlling disease progression. We report a case of histologically defined primary HIV vasculopathy in which the chance to start HAART was initially missed and in which the patient progressed to require bilateral amputations, but obtained disease quiescence upon commencement of HAART."

The month 6 KT ratio (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.74), soluble CD14 level (aHR, 2.32), interleukin 6 level (aHR, 2.34), and D-dimer level (aHR, 1.95) were associated with mortality occurring ≥6 months after ART initiation. The KT ratio remained significantly predictive of mortality even after adjustment for the additional biomarkers, suggesting an independent contribution to clinical outcomes in resource-limited settings."
1831,0.005,1.0000,"Anaemia, redistribution of Fe, malnutrition and heightened systemic inflammation during HIV infection confer an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in HIV patients. We analysed information on Fe status and inflammation from a randomised, double blind, controlled phase-III clinical trial in Lusaka, Zambia and Mwanza, Tanzania. Malnourished patients (n 1815) were recruited at referral to antiretroviral therapy (ART) into a two-stage nutritional rehabilitation programme, randomised to receive a lipid-based nutrient supplement with or without added micronutrients. Fe was included in the intervention arm during the second stage, given from 2 to 6 weeks post-ART. Hb, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) were measured at recruitment and 6 weeks post-ART. Multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the impact of the intervention, and the effect of reducing inflammation from recruitment to week 6 on Hb and Fe status. There was no effect of the intervention on Hb, serum ferritin, sTfR or serum CRP. A one-log decrease of serum CRP from recruitment to week 6 was associated with a 1.81 g/l increase in Hb (95% CI 0.85, 2.76; P< 0.001), and a 0.11 log decrease in serum ferritin (95% CI - 0.22, 0.03; P= 0.012) from recruitment to week 6. There was no association between the change in serum CRP and the change in sTfR over the same time period (P= 0.78). In malnourished, HIV-infected adults receiving dietary Fe, a reduction in inflammation in the early ART treatment period appears to be a precondition for recovery from anaemia."
8859,0.005,1.0000,"Previous studies have reported that hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection worsens neurocognitive status among individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. We assessed the prevalence of neurologic disorders and the severity of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment among HIV-infected individuals in two centralized HIV clinics in Alberta, Canada from 1998 to 2010 based on their HCV serostatus. Of 456 HIV-infected persons without concurrent substance abuse, 91 (20.0%) were HCV seropositive. Of 58 neurologic disorders identified in the cohort, HIV/HCV co-infected individuals exhibited a higher prevalence of multiple neurologic disorders compared to HIV-infected individuals (60.4% vs. 46.6%, p<0.05) and a higher frequency of seizures (28.6% vs. 17.8%, p<0.05). Unlike HIV mono-infected persons, the risk of seizures was independent of immune status in HIV/HCV co-infected individuals (p<0.05). Symptomatic HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (sHAND) were more severe among HIV/HCV co-infected persons (p<0.05). HCV co-infection was associated with an increased mortality rate (24.2% vs. 14.5%, p<0.05) with a mortality hazard ratio of 2.38 after adjusting for demographic and clinical variables. Our results indicate that the presence of HCV co-infection among HIV-infected individuals increased neurologic disease burden and risk of death, underscoring HCV's capacity to affect the nervous system and survival of HIV-infected persons."

No such change was observed for HIV-negative patients. The decrease in mortality is likely due to the more widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)."
4163,0.005,1.0000,"Noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis, measured at baseline, have been shown to predict liver-related mortality. It remains unknown if a change in the value of the scores over time predicts mortality in patients with HIV and viral hepatitis. In this retrospective study, survival in HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV; n = 67), HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV; n = 43), and HIV/HBV/HCV (n = 41) patients was examined using Kaplan-Meier life table analysis. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and FIB-4 scores, two noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis, were calculated at baseline and at last available clinical follow-up to determine the change in fibrosis score. Factors associated with mortality were assessed by Cox proportional hazards, including the change in the noninvasive marker score between the two time points. All-cause mortality was determined by Social Security Death Index and chart review. Sixty-seven were coinfected with HIV/HBV, 43 with HIV/HCV, and 41 were triply infected (HIV/HBV/HCV). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed similar survival for the three groups at 7 years of follow-up (p = 0.10). However, median length of follow-up was lower in HIV/HCV (60.5; range 0-102) compared to HIV/HBV (75.7; 12.3-126.5) and HIV/HBV/HCV (80.0; 2.7-123) months, respectively, p = 0.02. Baseline fibrosis score (p = 0.002), an increase in the value for noninvasive measurements for fibrosis (p < 0.001), and the presence of HIV/HCV coinfection (p = 0.041) were each associated with higher risk for mortality. Baseline fibrosis score (p = 0.03) and an increase in FIB-4 score (p = 0.05) were independent predictors of all-cause mortality, but liver-related mortality was not evaluated. In this study, baseline fibrosis score was predictive of 7-year all-cause mortality. Further studies are needed in a prospective cohort to evaluate the predictive value of monitoring changes in fibrosis scores over time to predict mortality in patients with viral hepatitis."
16863,0.005,1.0000,"A randomized, open-label comparative study of entecavir versus adefovir therapy was performed in subjects with chronic hepatitis B who had hepatic decompensation (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score ≥7). Adult subjects were randomized and treated (n = 191) with entecavir 1.0 mg or adefovir 10 mg daily for up to 96 weeks from the date of last subject randomization. Subjects were positive or negative for hepatitis B e antigen and experienced or naive for treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean reduction in serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, as determined by polymerase chain reaction, at week 24, adjusted for baseline HBV DNA and lamivudine resistance status by linear regression analysis. Entecavir demonstrated superiority to adefovir for this endpoint (treatment difference 1.74 log(10) copies/mL [95% confidence interval -2.30, -1.18]; P < 0.0001). The entecavir group showed a greater change from baseline in HBV DNA at all time points through week 48 and a higher proportion of subjects who achieved HBV DNA < 300 copies/mL at weeks 24 (entecavir 49%; adefovir 16%; P < 0.0001) and 48 (entecavir 57%; adefovir 20%; P < 0.0001). Approximately two-thirds of subjects in both groups showed improvement/stabilization in Child-Turcotte-Pugh status. Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score change at week 48 was -2.6 for entecavir and -1.7 for adefovir. Adverse event rates were comparable between groups. Cumulative hepatocellular carcinoma rates were 12% for entecavir and 20% for adefovir. Cumulative death rates were 23% for entecavir and 33% for adefovir. Week 24 mortality rates were 12% for both groups. conclusion: Entecavir demonstrated superior virologic efficacy to adefovir in a population of patients with chronic hepatitis B who had hepatic decompensation. Biochemical and clinical benefits were also demonstrated. Entecavir was well tolerated, and early mortality rates were consistent with rates observed in similar populations treated with lamivudine."
9311,0.005,1.0000,"In HIV-infected persons, age is negatively associated with optimal CD4 recovery following antiretroviral therapy. Our understanding of the situation in older adults, especially the middle-aged is, however, limited. We undertook to examine the latter's pattern of CD4/CD8 recovery following antiretroviral therapy.Retrospective clinical cohort data of HIV patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2014 in Hong Kong were collected. They were categorized by age at treatment initiation, viz., young adults (age 18-49), middle-aged (age 50-64), and elderly (≥65 years' old). Predictors of immune recovery (CD4 count, CD8 count, CD4/CD8 ratio) over time were examined using multivariable linear generalized estimating equations.A total of 2754 patients (aged ≥18) have been on antiretroviral therapy, with baseline characteristics similar between middle-aged and the elderly. Late diagnosis, defined as progression to AIDS within 3 months of HIV diagnosis, was less common in middle-aged (odds ratio = 0.58, 95% confidence interval = 0.37-0.91). Among Chinese patients who have been on treatment for ≥4 years (n = 913), 80.6%, 14.6%, and 4.8% were young adults, middle-aged, and elderly respectively. Late treatment initiation, defined as AIDS diagnosis or CD4 count ≤100 cells/μL before treatment, was common in middle-aged and elderly, the former however had faster CD4 recovery (3.95 vs. 3.36 cells/μL/month), but slower CD8 decline (-1.76 vs. -4.34 cells/μL/month) and CD4/CD8 normalization (0.009 vs. 0.0101/month).As a transitional age group, the immune recovery of middle-aged patients lagged behind young adults largely because of late treatment initiation. Following adoption of early and non-CD4-guided treatment initiation, their long-term clinical outcome is expected to improve."

We evaluated the renal function, urinalysis abnormalities and their correlates in HIV-infected individuals who were naïve to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This was a cross-sectional study of 2 months' duration involving 104 HIV-infected outpatients naive to HAART (71 women, 68%) attending the HIV clinic of the Yaoundé General Hospital in Cameroon. Renal and urinalysis parameters were measured and the Student t-test and Fischer exact test were used to compare the groups of participants. The mean age and CD4 count were, respectively, 35 ± 10.7 years and 305 ± 202/mL. Fifty-six (54%) patients presented with stages 3 and 4 of HIV infection. Forty-three (41%) patients had urinalysis abnormalities, including proteinuria (36%), leukocyturia (13%) and hematuria (12%). Proteinuria was associated with increased age, advanced stage of HIV infection, decreased CD4 count, hematuria and renal failure (P <0.04). Hematuria and leukocyturia were associated with decreased CD4 count and advanced stage of HIV infection, respectively (P = 0.04). The mean estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate was 100.2 ± 32.7 mL/min; three (3%) patients had renal failure (eGFR <60 mL/min) and 45 (43%) patients had reduced kidney function 60 ≤eGFR ≤90 mL/min. There was a high prevalence of decreased kidney function and proteinuria among Cameroonian HIV-infected patients naïve to HAART. Indicators of the severity of HIV infection, including advanced stage and low CD4 count, were associated with urinalysis abnormalities."

A cross-sectional study was conducted at two AIDS Outpatient Clinics in Brazil. The study included all HIV infected patients followed at these institutions from January 2005 to November 2007. Medical records of 2,024 HIV-infected patients were evaluated. The prevalence of anti-HCV positive patients among them was 16.7%. Medical records of HCV/HIV coinfected patients were analyzed. 189 patients with the following characteristics were included in our study: mean age 43 years; male gender 65%; former IDUs (52%); HCV genotype 1 (66.4%); HCV genotype 3 (30.5%); median CD4+ T cell count was 340 cells/mm³. Among 189 patients included in the analyses, only 75 (39.6%) were considered eligible for HCV treatment. The most frequent reasons for non-treatment were: non-compliance during clinical follow-up (31.4%), advanced HIV disease (21.9%), excessive alcohol consumption or active drug use (18.7%), and psychiatric disorders (10.1%)."
13995,0.005,1.0000,"We offered standardized gynecologic examinations to consecutive women admitted to an AIDS-designated inpatient medical service; 65 (97%) of 67 women consented to the examination. The median CD4+ T lymphocyte count was 54/mm3. Only 9% of the women were admitted for primary gynecologic or genitourinary diagnoses; however, on evaluation, 83% of these women had gynecologic disease. The overall prevalences of vaginitis, cervical dysplasia, genital condylomata, genital herpes, and pelvic inflammatory disease were 51%, 45%, 23%, 20%, and 5%, respectively. Unexpected findings included adenovirus infection and foscarnet-associated genital ulcerations (two cases each). For predicting disease, gynecologic symptoms had a sensitivity of 76% and a positive predictive value of 95% but a negative predictive value of only 41%. Our results document the high prevalence of comorbid gynecologic disease among women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Because of the inability to fully predict disease by symptom history, it is imperative that comprehensive gynecologic evaluation be offered routinely to all HIV-infected women hospitalized for acute medical illnesses."
6028,0.005,1.0000,"Diarrhea is a common symptom that many HIV patients experience either as a consequence of HIV infection or of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A multicenter, prospective observational study was conducted in 11 AIDS clinics in Italy to determine the effect of diarrhea on health-related quality of life among patients receiving HAART. The study enrolled 100 consecutive HIV positive patients who had diarrhea while on HAART. For each enrolled patient a control patient with matching disease stage who did not have diarrhea was identified using existing data from another prospective observational study conducted in 34 AIDS clinics (including the 11 in current study). Quality of life was measured by MOS-HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV). Paired t-test and multiple regression analysis were used to compare the quality of life among patients with and without diarrhea. Mean patient age was 40 +/- 7 years; 69% were male. Mean CD4 cell count was 342 +/- 239 cells/mm3; 59% had AIDS. Of the cases, 49 patients had severe diarrhea (> 5 bowel movements or > 3 watery per day) and 46 patients had moderate diarrhea (3-5 bowel movements). Compared to matched control patients, cases experiencing diarrhea while on HAART had significantly lower MOS-HIV scores in all domains. The significant adverse effect of diarrhea on quality of life should be considered when choosing the appropriate antiretroviral drugs regimen."

The study included patients recruited from the cohort (N = 261) and a comparison group (N = 82) of uninfected individuals, all enrolled from April to November 2009. Aortic stiffness was estimated using the carotid-femoral PWV (Complior-Artech, Paris, France). The groups were similar with respect to age, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, Framingham score, and use of antihypertensive and hypolipidemic medications. Hypertension was more frequent among the controls. Individuals with HIV had higher triglyceride, glucose and HDL cholesterol levels. Among individuals with HIV/AIDS, those with a nadir CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells/mm³ had a higher PWV (P = 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference when subjects were stratified by gender. Heart rate, age, male gender, and blood pressure were independently correlated with PWV. Nadir CD4+ T-cell count did not remain in the final model. There was no significance difference in PWV between HIV-infected individuals and uninfected controls. PWV was correlated with age, gender, and blood pressure across the entire population and among those infected with HIV. We recommend cohort studies to further explore the association between inflammation related to HIV infection and/or immune reconstitution and antiretroviral use and PWV."
7187,0.005,1.0000,"Although Hodgkin's disease (HD) is not usually associated with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency disorders, recent evidence would suggest a statistically significant increase in HD among individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In the setting of underlying HIV infection, clinical and pathologic characteristics of HD may differ from usual expectations. Thus, 70%-100% of HIV-infected patients with HD present with systemic ""B"" symptoms. Likewise, disseminated, stage III or IV disease is reported in approximately 75%-90%. Bone marrow is a common site of extranodal HD, occurring in 40%-50%. Complete response rates after multiagent chemotherapy range from approximately 45% to 70%, although median survival has been only in the range of approximately 18 months. Hematologic toxicity from multiagent chemotherapy may be substantial, even with the use of hematopoietic growth factor support. It is apparent that new strategies of therapeutic intervention must be explored."
19902,0.005,1.0000,"Recidivism is a pervasive problem facing the incarcerated. Incarcerated persons who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected often have multiple risk factors associated with initial incarceration and recidivism, in particular, injection drug use. Yet, some jails provide case management for HIV-infected inmates to provide continuity of health care, which might have positive effects on reentry into the community. We sought to measure recidivism and factors related to recidivism in an HIV-infected cohort in an urban county jail with an active case management program. Fifty-two inmates surveyed in 1999 at the San Francisco County Jail were followed for rearrests through 2006. In follow-up, 73% were re-incarcerated on an average of 6.8 times for 552 days. Risk factors included nonwhite ethnicity, history of homelessness and crack use, common risk factors for incarceration. Less than high school education was associated with recidivism, shorter time to reincarceration, and more incarcerations. HIV-infected inmates spend a high proportion of time in multiple incarcerations, a reflection of the cyclical nature of incarceration despite comprehensive case management. Well-known risk factors for incarceration were associated with recidivism; in addition, lack of high school education played a prominent role. Education should be explored as a way to make further progress on breaking the cycle of incarceration."
3451,0.005,1.0000,"Data on the bone metabolism of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are still extremely rare. To investigate the influence of HIV infection on the calciotropic hormones and markers of bone metabolism, we therefore performed a cross-sectional study on 100 patients (65 males and 35 females) with proven HIV infection. The following criteria were used for exclusion from the study: age less than 20/more than 50 years, confinement to bed, wasting symptoms, treatment with agents containing ketoconazole, renal or hepatic insufficiency, clinical or echographic signs of liver cirrhosis, endocrine diseases, or treatment with medications known to influence bone metabolism. Bone mineral content (BMC) was determined by single-photon absorptiometry on the left forearm. Reduced BMC was found among the male and female HIV-infected patients. Additional long-term use of heroin resulted in a severe loss of mineralization in the respective females. The markers of bone metabolism were determined in urine and serum samples. Significantly lower osteocalcin concentrations were found, indicating a reduced bone formation rate whose severity showed a significant correlation with the progressive loss of CD4 helper cells and was independent of low vitamin D3 levels (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) and alterations of protein metabolism. Increased urinary excretion of cross-links as an expression of enhanced bone resorption was likewise significantly correlated with the loss of CD4 helper cells and independent of the vitamin D concentration and protein metabolism. It is therefore concluded that the changes in bone metabolism are mainly due to mechanisms of the impaired immune defense of HIV-infected patients."
15079,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy has greatly reduced the morbidity and mortality from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but AIDS continues to be a serious health problem worldwide. Despite enormous efforts to develop a vaccine, there is still no cure, and alternative approaches including gene therapy should be explored. In this study we developed and compared combinatorial foamy virus (FV) anti-HIV vectors that also express a mutant methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMTP140K) transgene to increase the percentage of gene-modified cells after transplantation. These FV vectors inhibit replication of HIV-1 and also the simian immunodeficiency virus/HIV-1 (SHIV) chimera that can be used in monkey AIDS gene therapy studies. We identified a combinatorial FV vector that expresses 3 anti-HIV transgenes and inhibits viral replication by over 4 logs in a viral challenge assay. This FV anti-HIV vector expresses an HIV fusion inhibitor and two short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeted to HIV-1 tat and rev, and can be produced at high titer (3.8 x 10(7) transducing units ml(-1)) using improved helper plasmids suitable for clinical use. Using a competitive repopulation assay, we show that human CD34(+) cells transduced with this combinatorial FV vector efficiently engraft in a mouse xenotransplantation model, and that the percentage of transduced repopulating cells can be increased after transplantation."
15914,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was first reported and characterized more than three decades ago. Once thought of as a death sentence, HIV infection has become a chronically manageable disease. However, it is estimated that a staggering 0.8% of the world's population is infected with HIV, with more than 1 million deaths reported in 2015 alone. Despite the development of effective anti-retroviral drugs, a permanent cure has only been documented in one patient to date. In 2007, an HIV-positive patient received a bone marrow transplant to treat his leukemia from an individual who was homozygous for a mutation in the CCR5 gene. This mutation, known as CCR5Δ32, prevents HIV replication by inhibiting the early stage of viral entry into cells, resulting in resistance to infection from the majority of HIV isolates. More than 10 years after his last dose of anti-retroviral therapy, the transplant recipient remains free of replication-competent virus. Multiple groups are now attempting to replicate this success through the use of other CCR5-negative donor cell sources. Additionally, developments in the use of lentiviral vectors and targeted nucleases have opened the doors of precision medicine and enabled new treatment methodologies to combat HIV infection through targeted ablation or down-regulation of CCR5 expression. Here, we review historical cases of CCR5-edited cell-based therapies, current clinical trials and future benefits and challenges associated with this technology."
10138,0.005,1.0000,"The incidence of non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphoma is known to be increased in patients who are seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We report here a multicentre retrospective study of 21 HIV-positive patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma seen between 1985 and 1987. All phenotype B lymphomas of intermediate or high malignancy grade according to the Working Formulation are difficult to classify histologically. Because of this problem, reexamination of the specimens by several pathologists and perhaps also the use of other morphological prognostic criteria, such as mitotic index, seem to be desirable. In more than one-third of our patients the presence of a lymphoma led to the finding of HIV seropositivity in subjects who were all issued from populations at risk. Median age was 39 years. Spread evaluation showed stage III or IV in most cases with, in 4 out of 5 patients, extranodal sites, notably the neuromeningeal system, liver, gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow. The median overall survival was 5 months, but in April 1989 2 patients had survived for more than 30 months. Obtaining complete remission (11/21 cases) was imperative for a 10 months' survival. Eight of the 11 patients in whom complete remission was obtained had received the heavy induction chemotherapy required by the degree of malignancy, but no death due to drug toxicity was recorded. 17 patients died, with active lymphoma (12 cases) and/or infection (8 cases) being documented at the time of death. The finding of more than 500/sq. mm CD4 lymphocytes in peripheral blood in 10 cases while the lymphoma was developing, and the heterogeneity of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) profile in serum raise the question of the role played by T-cell immunodeficiency and by EBV infection in the physiopathogenesis of these lymphomas."
18766,0.005,1.0000,"It is known that antiretroviral drugs can induce immunologic improvement in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other manifestations of HIV infection. However, the improvements so attained are often partial and transient. This may result from a number of factors, including incomplete inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication by available agents, the development of viral drug resistance, the effect of cytokines, or thymic damage. An understanding of this problem may be important in further development of AIDS therapies. It will also be important to learn how to best assess the response to various therapies. In this regard, the CD4 count is evolving as a mortality risk indicator in AIDS and as such may find utility in assessing new therapeutic approaches. We have observed that in a cohort of gay men receiving antiretroviral therapy in a research environment, nearly all deaths occurred in individuals with fewer than 50 CD4 cells/mm3. However, the relationship between the CD4 count and the hazard of dying may be influenced by a number of factors (e.g., active intravenous drug use, extreme poverty, etc.), and further studies are needed to define the relationship between CD4 and clinical endpoints under a variety of conditions."
6800,0.005,1.0000,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) upstream of IL28B predict the outcome of treatment in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but their impact on viral kinetics and relation to other predictors are not well known. Here, two SNPs, rs12979860 and rs8099917, were analysed and related to early viral kinetics during treatment in 110 patients with HCV genotype 1 infection. The reduction of HCV RNA after 7 days of therapy was more pronounced (P < 0.0001) in patients with CC(rs12979860) or TT(rs8099917) than in patients carrying TT(rs12979860) or GG(rs8099917), respectively. The two SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium (d' = 1, r2 = 0.44), but CC(rs12979860) was less common (43% vs. 71%) than TT(rs8099917). Patients carrying both CC(rs12979860) and TT(rs8099917) genotypes achieved lower levels of HCV RNA at week 4 than those with CT or TT at rs12979860 and TT(rs8099917) (P = 0.0004). The viral elimination was significantly influenced by rs12979860 independently of baseline viral load, age or fibrosis. This translated into high rates of sustained viral response (SVR) among patients carrying CC(rs12979860) despite the presence of high viral load at baseline (SVR 74%), high age (SVR 79%) or severe liver fibrosis (SVR 83%). We conclude that the IL28B variability influences the antiviral efficiency of interferon/ribavirin therapy and has a strong impact on SVR, independently of traditional response predictors. A combined assessment of these SNPs in conjunction with other response predictors may better predict outcome in difficult-to-treat patients."

CD4(+) CD1d-rectricted natural killer (NKT) cell depletion was evidenced in 26 HIV-1 infected children with active viral replication despite HAART. Conversely, no alteration was evidenced in 17 children with undetectable viral load, suggesting full recovery in both CD4(+) and CD4(-) CD1d-rectricted NKT cell subsets. The loss of CD4(+) NKT cells in unresponsive children may have clinical consequences, including autoimmune disorders or cancer development. Future therapeutic perspectives are suggested."
12151,0.005,1.0000,"Macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), which are the natural ligands of the CC-chemokine receptor CCR5, inhibit replication of MT-2- negative strains of HIV-1 by interfering with the ability of these strains to utilize CCR5 as a coreceptor for entry in CD4(+) cells. The present study investigates the capacity of natural killer (NK) cells isolated from HIV-infected individuals to produce CC-chemokines and to suppress HIV replication in autologous, endogenously infected cells as well as to block entry of MT-2-negative HIV into the CD4(+) T cell line PM-1. NK cells freshly isolated from HIV-infected individuals had a high number of mRNA copies for MIP-1alpha and RANTES. NK cells produced significant amounts of RANTES, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1beta constitutively, in response to stimulation with IL-2 alone and when they were performing their characteristic lytic activity (K562 killing). After CD16 cross-linking and stimulation with IL-2 or IL-15 NK cells produced CC-chemokines to levels comparable to those produced by anti-CD3-stimulated CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, CD16 cross-linked NK cells suppressed (49-97%) viral replication in cocultures of autologous CD8/NK-depleted PBMC to a degree similar to that of PHA or anti-CD3-stimulated CD8(+) T cells. In 50% of patients tested, NK-mediated HIV suppression could be abrogated by neutralizing antibodies to MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta and RANTES; in contrast, CD8(+) T cell-mediated suppression was not significantly overcome upon neutralization of CC-chemokines. Supernatants derived from cultures of CD16 cross-linked NK cells stimulated with IL-2 or IL-15 dramatically inhibited entry of a MT-2-negative strain of HIV, BaL, in the CD4(+)CCR5(+) PM-1 T cell line. These data suggest that activated NK cells may be an important source of CC-chemokines in vivo and may suppress HIV replication by CC-chemokine-mediated mechanisms in addition to classic NK-mediated lytic mechanisms."
6923,0.005,1.0000,"Dendritic cells, the primary antigen presenting cells of the human immune system, are heavily infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) is a contact sensitizing agent that acts as a potent immune modulator of dendritic cells. In this pilot study, we examined the safety and efficacy of topical DNCB application in patients with early HIV disease. Topical DNCB was well tolerated by these patients, with an adverse reaction rate of 10%. CD4+ T-cell counts remained stable with repeated DNCB use. In contrast, CD8+ T-cell counts and natural killer cells increased significantly following DNCB sensitization. This increase in CD8+ T-cell and natural killer cell subsets was accompanied by a decrease in HIV replication, as measured by serum HIV RNA levels. Based on this pilot study, we conclude that topical DNCB is safe in early HIV disease and may decrease viral load via a systemic effect on dendritic cells, CD8+ T-cells and natural killer cells. These results require confirmation in larger controlled trials."

Evidence for viral compartmentalization was suggested by earlier studies that noted the poor correlation between blood and seminal virus load, phenotype, and genotype. Further support for this viral compartmentalization was based on the following observations between semen and blood: lack of association between culturability of virus in semen and viral RNA level in blood, discordant distribution of viral phenotypes, discordant viral RNA levels, a weak correlation between viral RNA level in semen and CD4 cell count in blood, differences in the biologic variability of viral RNA levels, and differences in the virus load response to antiretroviral therapy."
9899,0.005,1.0000,"The present study sought to investigate the impact of life stress on treatment adherence and viral load of HIV-positive individuals. Three different aspects of life stress were examined in this investigation (perceived stress, acute life events unrelated to the HIV illness, and HIV-related acute life events). Furthermore, we examined whether these relationships were moderated by depressive severity, self-esteem, and neuroticism. Participants (n = 24) were treatment- seeking HIV-positive individuals who completed a series of questionnaires for this investigation. The majority of the participants in this sample were middle-aged, Caucasian males who identified themselves as either homosexual or bisexual, had contracted HIV via sexual contact, and met criteria for AIDS (mean CD4 count = 324). This sample was highly self-selected and varied from the county HIV-positive population in terms of gender, ethnicity, and HIV risk factor. Information on their adherence and viral load was collected from their medical records 6 to 9 months after completion of the psychological measurements. Results indicated that perceived stress, but not acute events, prospectively predicted adherence. Moreover, marginal trends suggested that depressive symptoms and neuroticism moderated the effect of perceived stress on adherence. Neither perceived stress nor acute life events were associated with viral load."

However, patients who achieve a rapid virologic response after 4 weeks of peginterferon and ribavirin therapy are likely to achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), and we hypothesized that protease inhibitor therapy may be unnecessary in these patients. Treatment-naïve, noncirrhosis patients infected with genotype-1 HCV and a low viral load at baseline were considered for inclusion (n = 233). After 4 weeks of lead-in therapy with peginterferon α-2b and ribavirin, 101 patients (48%) had a rapid virologic response (defined as undetectable levels of hepatitis C virus RNA at 4 weeks) and were eligible to participate. Patients were randomized 1:1 to 20 weeks of additional therapy with peginterferon α-2b and ribavirin (double therapy) or to 24 weeks of peginterferon α-2b, ribavirin, and boceprevir (triple therapy). There was no significant difference in rates of SVR-12 in patients treated with double versus triple therapy. This similarity persisted regardless of viral subtype (genotype 1a or 1b), interleukin (IL)-28b genotype (CC or non-CC), or ethnicity (African American versus non-Hispanic white)."

Since January 1997, it has monitored those HIV-1 patients who are under treatments at most HIV-1 health care clinics, including both public and private. The present study was conducted to evaluate how the new treatment has generally impacted on the HIV-1 disease status of HIV-1 infected population in the eight Immunology Clinics. Assessment was made by consecutively monitoring the changes in HIV-1 viral load profiles of the population from January to September, 1997. A large majority of samples were delivered for viral load assessment without information of their treatment status, and only a small number of samples were identifiable either as baseline or followup. Despite the paucity of individual information, remarkable improvements of HIV-1 (+) population at large were evident. For example, in the summer of 1996 (ACCESS), population median viral load was 51,842; only 9% of the population had viral load less than 500 viral RNA copies/ml plasma and 72% had over 10,000 copies/ml. By July-September, 1997, the population median dropped to 8,679 (83%); 23% were below 500 copies/ml (+156%) and the proportion of patients who had over 10,000 copies/ml was reduced to 48% (-33%). The group of individuals who were positively identified as ""follow-up"" (i.e., under active treatment) had a median of 37128 copies/ml (-94%); 28% were below 500 copies/ml (+211%) and only 40% had more than 10,000 copies/ml (-44%). It is obvious that the implementation of triple combination therapy by PASET in 1997, has very markedly improve the HIV-1 disease status of HIV-1 (+) population in Puerto Rico."

HIV‐specific CD3- cell responses to any region (Env and Reg predominantly targeted) were associated with lower viral load (P = .031) and higher CD4 T cell count (P = .015). Env‐specific CD3- cell responses were stronger in women who had both Gag CD4 and CD8 T cell responses and, in turn, was associated with lower viral load (P = .005). CD3- cell responders had significantly higher representation of CD4 T cell responses to Env and Reg (P = .012 and P = .015, respectively) and higher magnitudes of CD4 T cell responses (P = .017 and P = .037, respectively) than did nonresponders. Peptide‐specific natural killer cells are associated with markers of less severe disease progression among HIV‐1-infected women (lower viral load and higher CD4 T cell count) and with stronger HIV‐specific T cell responses."

Serum samples were tested for the presence of cryoglobulins, hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, including HBV-DNA by hybridization assay, and antibody to HCV by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Serum HCV-RNA was tested by polymerase chain reaction and typed with a hybridization technique. Samples were also tested for antitissue antibodies, immunoglobulins, rheumatoid factor, and C3 and C4 proteins of complement. Forty-two hemophiliacs (31%) circulated cryoglobulins (median levels, 166 mg/L; range, 66 to 480) predominantly type III (62%; and 29% type II). None of the patients had clinical signs or symptoms of systemic vasculitis. Cryoglobulinemic patients had more often serum HCV-RNA (95% v 80%, P < .05), rheumatoid factor (20% v 6%, P < .05), higher levels of IgG (2,354 +/- 682 mg/dL v 1,928 +/- 557 mg/dL, P < .0005) and IgM (323 +/- 226 mg/dL v 244 +/- 243 mg/dL, P < .05), and lower levels of serum C4 (19 +/- 8 mg/dL v 24 +/- 8 mg/dL, P < .05) than patients without cryoglobulins. The risk of producing cryoglobulins was greater for 114 patients circulating HCV-RNA than for 21 nonviremic patients (odds ratio [OR] = 4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 to 22.0) and for the 31 patients with longer exposure to HCV (more than 26 years) than for the 24 patients with shorter (17 years or less) exposure (OR = 4.4 95% CI = 1.1 to 18.0). In conclusion a large number of multitransfused hemophiliacs with chronic HCV infection circulated serum cryoglobulins but none had clinical signs or symptoms of vasculitis. The risk of developing cryoglobulins parallels the duration of exposure to HCV."
265,0.005,1.0000,"This study estimated the frequency of nine primitive reflexes (PR) and assessed their possible clinical value in a group of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We studied 78 patients with human inmunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) infection in WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 and 81 matched seronegative controls. All participants were examined using a standardized neurological examination and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Cognitive impairment and PR was found in 36% of patients but in none of the controls (P<0.0001; logistic regression odds ratio: 14.7). Overall, PR were 2-36 times more frequent in patients with HIV-1 infection. This association was stronger for the glabellar, snout, Rossolimo, and digital signs. At least two PR were observed in 92% of patients vs. 8% of controls (P<0.0001; 95% confidence interval: 68%-100%; logistic regression odds ratio: 10.8). These data support the association of PR with cognitive decline in patients with advanced HIV-1 infection without overt neurological disease. Larger follow-up studies with multivariate techniques are needed to identify which PRs are useful as indicators of HIV-1-associated cognitive/motor complex and minor neurocognitive disorders."

HBsAg-positive patients with NHL were identified from the lymphoma database of the Asan Medical Center from January 1995 to August 2002, and their medical records were reviewed. We found that 31 patients were received cytotoxic chemotherapy among 41 NHL patients with HBsAg-positive during same period. We divided them into 2 groups of HBsAg patients with NHL as follows: Group A who received cytotoxic chemotherapy with lamivudine 100 mg daily; Group B without any prophylactic antiviral therapy. There were no significant differences between Group A and B in several clinical variables. Seventeen patients (85%) in group B and one patient (9%) in Group A had hepatitis due to reactivation of HBV (p<0.001), with one hepatic failure related death in Group B and none in group A. The mean dose intensity of adriamycin actually delivered was 13.3 mg/m2/week (80% Relative Dose intensity (RDI)) in Group A and 9.1 mg/m2/week (55% RDI) in Groups B (p<0.001). Our data suggest that the frequency of chemotherapy-related HBV reactivation may be significantly decreased by lamivudine prophylaxis with maintenance of the dosage of adriamycin."
6836,0.005,1.0000,"Adefovir dipivoxil [bis(pivaloyloxymethyl)-ester prodrug], an orally bioavailable prodrug of adefovir [9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine], is currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In vitro experiments demonstrated that either a K65R or a K70E mutation in HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) was selected in the presence of adefovir, conferring a 16- or 9-fold decrease in susceptibility to adefovir, respectively. Previous data demonstrated that patients receiving adefovir dipivoxil monotherapy (125 mg daily) for 12 weeks experienced a median decrease in HIV RNA levels of 0.5 log10 copies/ml and that resistance to adefovir dipivoxil did not arise during that period. In the present investigation, a further study was undertaken to investigate whether RT mutations developed among viruses from patients who completed the 12-week study and who opted to enroll in a maintenance phase of prolonged (6- to 12-month) adefovir dipivoxil therapy (120 mg daily). Concomitant treatment with antiretroviral agents was permitted during the maintenance phase. The median decreases in HIV RNA levels for patients who completed 6 or 12 months of maintenance-phase dosing were 0.6 and 1.14 log10 copies/ml, respectively. The reductions in the HIV RNA levels were similar among patients who received adefovir dipivoxil with or without concomitant treatment with antiretroviral agents. Viruses from 8 of 29 patients dosed for up to 12 months developed RT mutations that were not present at baseline; these mutations may have been related to adefovir dipivoxil therapy. Viruses from two of the eight patients developed the K70E mutation while the patients were on therapy, but none of the viruses from patients developed the K65R RT substitution. Despite the development of RT mutations, sustained reductions (6 to 12 months) in viral load (> or = 0.7 log10 copies/ml decrease from baseline) were observed in all eight patients."
2262,0.005,1.0000,"Sustained viral suppression using monotherapy with interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) or lamivudine can only be achieved in a small percentage of patients with chronic hepatitis B. The concomitant administration of lamivudine and IFN-alpha does not enhance efficacy. We postulated that the optimal timing of therapy might be sequential treatment with lamivudine and IFN-alpha. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the efficacy of sequential treatment in patients resistant to IFN-alpha alone. Fourteen male patients, with a median age of 40 years, nonresponders to IFN-alpha with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA > 100 pg/mL (branched DNA [bDNA] Chiron) and positive hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in 11 of 14 patients, were treated with lamivudine 100 mg/d alone for 20 weeks, then with both IFN-alpha2b 5 MU 3 times per week and lamivudine for 4 weeks, and lastly with IFN-alpha alone for 24 weeks. At the end of lamivudine therapy, all patients had undetectable serum HBV DNA, and none exhibited an emergence of HBV polymerase mutant or breakthrough. Sustained serum HBV-DNA clearance 6 months after the end of sequential treatment was achieved in 8 of 14 patients, HBeAg-to-anti-HBe seroconversion in 5 of 11 patients, and HBeAg and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroconversions in 3 of 14 patients (anti-HBs > 100 IU/mL). All sustained responders had normalized their alanine transaminase (ALT) values and exhibited histologic improvements. In conclusion, the results of this pilot study suggest that sequential treatment with lamivudine and IFN-alpha can induce a sustained virologic response, including HBs seroconversion, in patients with chronic hepatitis B not responding to IFN-alpha alone, without the selection of drug-resistant mutants. This therapeutic schedule warrants further evaluation in clinical trials."
7953,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated the plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety of once-daily low-dose boosted saquinavir (SQVr; 1,200 of saquinavir [SQV] with 100 mg of ritonavir) plus two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors in treatment-naive or limited protease inhibitor (PI)-experienced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. A prospective study without entry restrictions on the plasma HIV-RNA (VL) or CD4 cell count was carried out. Plasma and intracellular SQV levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Efficacy was evaluated by an intention-to-treat analysis; treatment failure was defined as virological failure (a VL of >50 copies/ml after 24 weeks or a confirmed rebound to >50 copies/ml) or interruption for any reason. A total of 151 patients were included in the study (106 of them either had never received PI or had no previous virological failure on PIs) and could be characterized as follows: previous C3 stage, 28.9%; injection-drug users, 69.1%; subjects with chronic viral hepatitis, 53%; and subjects with cirrhosis, 10%. The median baseline CD4 level was 184/mul, and the median VL was 4.8 log(10) copies/ml. Median C(max), area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h, and C(min) plasma and intracellular SQV levels were 3,672 and 10,105 ng/ml, 34,283 and 99,535 ng.h/ml, and 359 and 1,062 ng/ml, respectively. The efficacy as determined by intention to treat at 52 weeks was 69.7% (96% in the on-treatment analysis), with similar results regardless of the baseline VL and CD4 counts. Only five patients had virological failure despite adequate C(min) levels, but with a poor adherence (the only variable related to virological failure). Adverse events caused the withdrawal of the treatment in four patients (2.6%). In conclusion, given the pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy, and tolerability of this regimen, once-daily low-dose SQVr may be considered a treatment option in treatment-naive or limited PI-experienced HIV-infected patients, with the additional benefit of being currently the least-expensive PI-based regimen available."
13502,0.005,1.0000,"Neurological disorders caused by Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) are rarely reported in the Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) period. The objective of this study was to describe the main clinical and laboratory features of patients with CMV-related neurological complications in HIV-infected patients admitted to a referral center in São Paulo, Brazil. CMV disease requires the identification of the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Thirteen cases were identified between January, 2004 and December, 2008. The median age of patients was 38 years and nine (69%) were men. At admission all patients were aware of their HIV status and only four (31%) patients were on HAART. Patients who were not on antiretroviral therapy before admission received HAART while inpatients. CMV disease was the first AIDS-defining illness in eight (62%) patients. The neurologic syndromes identified were diffuse encephalitis (n = 7; 62%), polyradiculopathy (n = 7; 54%), focal encephalitis (rhombencephalitis) (n = 1; 8%), and ventriculo-encephalitis (n = 1; 8%). Seven (54%) patients presented extra-neural CMV disease and four (31%) had retinitis. The median of CD4+ T-cell count was 13 cells/µL (range: 1-124 cells/µL). Overall in-hospital mortality was 38%. Eight patients used ganciclovir or foscarnet (in-hospital mortality: 50%) and five patients used ganciclovir and foscarnet (in-hospital mortality: 20%). None of the patients fulfilled the diagnosis criteria of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Four patients were lost to follow-up, and three patients presented immune recovery and discontinued secondary prophylaxis. Although infrequent, distinct neurological syndromes caused by CMV continue to cause high mortality among AIDS patients. Survival depends upon the use of effective antiviral therapy against CMV and the early introduction of HAART."
19042,0.005,1.0000,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a lytic infection of oligodendrocytes by the human papovavirus JC. Patients with defects in cell-mediated immunity are at risk for active disease: a usually lethal demyelination of the brain. PML develops in at least 4% of patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Definitive diagnosis currently requires brain biopsy. Previous attempts to detect JC virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction in cerebrospinal fluid of PML patients, particularly those with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, have been of low sensitivity. In the present study, cerebrospinal fluid was assayed by polymerase chain reaction from 26 HIV-1-positive patients with PML, 114 HIV-1-positive control subjects, and 16 control subjects who were HIV-1 negative or were without risk factors for HIV disease. Polymerase chain reaction conditions were optimized to detect a single copy of viral DNA in 50 microliters of cerebrospinal fluid. Specificity of the polymerase chain reaction product was confirmed by size on gel electrophoresis and Southern blot hybridization. JC virus DNA was detected in 24 of 26 samples from patients with PML: 8 of 8 with tissue diagnosis and 16 of 18 with strong clinical and magnetic resonance imaging evidence of PML. Among control subjects, 11 of 130 samples were positive for JC virus: 10 of 114 samples from HIV-infected patients and one from an HIV-negative patient with risk factors for PML and an unexplained hemiparesis. Overall sensitivity was 92% (24/26); specificity was, at minimum, 92% (119/130). Treatments for PML are now in clinical trials.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

However, a substantial proportion of patients demonstrates <4-fold reduction of titers after recommended therapy (serofast state). It remains unclear whether the serofast state is indicative of persistence of bacteria or only a residual immune response.The aim of the present study was to determine the association between the serofast state and the risk of neurosyphilis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and to identify potential predictors of neurosyphilis.Thirty-three patients with early syphilis and HIV co-infection were included. One year after the recommended treatment of syphilis, all patients who did not achieve proper serologic response underwent lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination.Twelve months after completing therapy for syphilis, the proportion of patients with serofast state after syphilis therapy was 36.4% (n = 12). Among them, 5 (41.7%) had neurosyphilis. Individuals who remained serofast and had neurosyphilis (n = 5) when compared to those without neurosyphilis (n = 7) were characterized by significantly lower CD4+ cell count and higher HIV RNA levels (P < .05). Moreover, a significantly higher proportion of patients with neurosyphilis was not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). The nonreceipt of ART independently increased the risk of neurosyphilis in the analyzed group of serofast HIV-infected patients (odds ratio = 4.5; 95% confidence interval 1.5-13.59, P = .003).Patients co-infected with HIV require careful serologic and clinical follow-up after therapy for syphilis. In all of the patients who do not respond serologically after treatment for syphilis, especially in those who are not receiving ART, lumbar puncture and CSF examination should be considered."

Chronic HBV-infected (CHB) patients are unable to properly respond to hepatitis B virus (HBV). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the mRNA levels of MDA5 and RIG-1 in the peripheral blood immune cells of CHB patients in comparison to healthy controls. In this cross-sectional study, the mRNA levels of MDA5 and RIG-1 were examined in 60 CHB patients and 60 healthy controls using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Our results showed that mRNA levels of MDA5 and RIG-1 were significantly decreased and increased, respectively, in CHB patients when compared to healthy controls. Our results also revealed that mRNA levels of MDA5 and RIG-1 were not altered among CHB patients with various states of e-antigen of hepatitis B and HBV-DNA viral loads. According to the results presented here, it may be concluded that downregulation of MDA5 may be a responsible mechanism from several reasons, which leads to HBV persistence in CHB patients. "
8120,0.005,1.0000,"An extension of a previously proposed theory for the pathogenesis of AIDS is presented and analyzed using a mathematical modelling approach. This theory is based on the observation that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) predominantly infects and replicates in (CD4+)-T cells, and that the infection process within an infected individual is characterized by ongoing generation and selection of HIV variants with increasing reproductive capacity. This evolutionary process is considered to be the reason for the gradual loss of immunocompetence and the final destruction of the immune system observed in most patients. The extension presented here incorporates the effect of the permanently increasing susceptibility of (CD4+)-T cell clones, as a result of the evolutionary process. The presented model reproduces and possibly explains a wide variety of findings about the HIV infection process. Numerical results indicate that the effect of the initial dose is minimal, and restricted to the primary phase of infection. According to the model predictions the impact of the HIV evolutionary speed is crucial for the progression to disease. An important progression determinant is the initial infection rate, being a component of the viral reproductive capacity. An influential role in disease progression seems to be played by the initial (CD4+)-T cell count."
6522,0.005,1.0000,"The CNS remains vulnerable to HIV-induced damage despite highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Using a rigorous simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque model of HAART that combines three classes of antiretroviral drugs (a protease inhibitor, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and an integrase inhibitor), we examined immune responses and virus replication in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) following HAART initiation during acute infection (4 days postinoculation (p.i.)). HAART-treated macaques did not experience the level of acute CD4+ and CD8+ T cell and NK cell count suppression in the peripheral blood normally observed during acute infection. Initiation of HAART produced a rapid four-log decline in viral load in plasma and a slower two-log decline of viral RNA in the CSF over the subsequent 17 days of infection. Despite a dramatic reduction of viral RNA levels in the brain at 21 days p.i., viral DNA levels were not different between the two groups. Expression of most cytokine mRNA in brain of HAART-treated macaques did not significantly differ from untreated controls. Expression of the IFN responsive gene MxA was significantly reduced in the brain of HAART-treated macaques, suggesting control of hyperactive immune responses. Control of virus replication likely was enhanced by significant increases in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell trafficking in the brain of infected animals on HAART therapy and the concomitant increase in levels of IFNγ. Collectively, these data indicate preserved innate and adaptive immune activity in the brain following HAART initiation during acute SIV infection in this macaque model, suggesting profound benefits following acute treatment of SIV."
420,0.005,1.0000,"Although no longer considered therapeutically beneficial, antiretroviral treatment interruptions (TIs) still occur frequently among patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection for a variety of reasons. TIs typically result in viral rebound and worsening immunosuppression, which in turn are risk factors for neurocognitive decline and dementia. We sought to determine the extent of neurocognitive risk with TIs and subsequent reintroduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) by using a comprehensive, sensitive neuropsychological assessment and by concurrently determining changes in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral load and CD4 counts. Prospective, serial, clinical evaluations including neuropsychological (NP) testing and measurement of plasma HIV RNA and CD4 count and mood state were performed on HIV-1-infected individuals (N=11) at three time points: (1) prior to a TI, while on HAART; (2) after TIs averaging 6 months; and (3) after reinitiating HAART therapy. During TI, plasma HIV RNA increased and CD4 counts declined significantly, but NP performance did not change. Following reinitiation of HAART, viral loads fell below pre-TI levels, and CD4 counts rose. Improved viral suppression and immune restoration with reinitiation of HAART resulted in significant improvement in neurocognitive performance. No changes on comprehensive questionnaires of mood state were observed in relation to TI.NP performance and mood state remained stable during TIs despite worsened viral loads and CD4 counts. Because ""practice effects"" are generally greatest between the first and second NP testing sessions, improvement at the third, post-TI time point was unlikely to be accounted for by practice. TIs of up to 6 months appear to be neurocognitively and psychiatrically safe for most patients."
9594,0.005,1.0000,"Syphilis is a frequent coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Whereas systemic syphilis infection increases plasma HIV RNA levels (viral load; VL), effects of syphilis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VL are unknown. We hypothesized that intrathecal immune activation in neurosyphilis would selectively increase CSF VL in coinfected patients. In this study, HIV-infected research subjects (N = 225) were categorized into three groups based on serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR), microhemaglutination for Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP) MHA-TP, and CSF VDRL: 23 with neurosyphilis (NS+; reactive serum RPR and MHA-TP and positive CSF VDRL); 42 with systemic syphilis but not neurosyphilis (Syph+; reactive serum RPR and MHA-TP; negative CSF VDRL), and 160 without syphilis (Syph-; nonreactive serum RPR). Plasma and CSF HIV VL were quantified by reverse transcriptase-ploymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Amplicor, Roche) in log(10) copies/ml. To adjust for covariates previously shown to influence CSF HIV VL (i.e., plasma VL, CD4, pleocytosis, and highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]), multivariable linear regression was used. Lumbar punctures (LP) done for research purposes diagnosed 23 with neurosyphilis; most (83%) of these reported prior syphilis treatment. Among subjects with detectable plasma VL, CSF VL was highest in NS+, followed by Syph+ and Syph- (P =.006). This relationship was independent of the level of plasma VL or CSF pleocytosis. By contrast, among subjects with undetectable plasma HIV VL, CSF VLs were similar in the three syphilis subgroups (P = .50). Neurosyphilis may amplify intrathecal HIV replication, possibly through immune activation that persists even after syphilis treatment. Because elevated CSF VL is associated with subsequent neurocognitive decline, future studies should evaluate the impact of neurosyphilis on the course of central nervous system (CNS) HIV infection."
11434,0.005,1.0000,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating viral disease produced by the John Cunningham (JC) virus, which is ubiquitously distributed. Up to 80% of adults seroconvert to JC virus. Classically, PML is a life-threatening AIDS-defining disease of the CNS, usually occurring in severely immunocompromised individuals. Until now, and despite several therapeutic attempts, there is no specific treatment for PML. Soon after the widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), several studies showed prolonged survival for patients with AIDS-associated PML who were treated with CART. The outcome of PML in patients receiving CART is unpredictable at disease onset. Prognostic markers are needed. The JC virus DNA detection in cerebrospinal fluid by nucleic acid amplification techniques and the CD4+ cell count are the most promising parameters. Higher levels of CD4+ cell counts were independently associated with an improved survival in different clinical observations. A summary of the main current knowledge about AIDS-related PML is presented. The most effective strategy is to optimize CART to completely suppress HIV-1 viral load and allow the best CD4+ T-cell immune recovery. Nowadays, AIDS-related PML is no longer an ultimately fatal disease. A substantial number of HIV-1-infected patients with this condition can improve with CART."

Although conventional Amplicor HIV-1 monitor system (Roche's conventional method) is used widely, the sensitivity of this system is not enough for measurement of subtype E and A giving lower titer of these subtype viruses than the actual quantity. In Japan, HIV-1 subytpe B cases used to be predominant but recently subtype E cases are increasing especially among heterosexuals thus it becomes required to increase the sensitivity of measurement of HIV-1 RNA of subtype E or A. Therefore we establised the Kanagawa primer method using newly developed subtype E and A primers added to the primers of Roche's conventional method. The results were compared with the conventional Amplicor and also with Roche's new version method which contained new primers. Kanagawa primer method gave 4 to 16 times more sensitive results as compared with Roche's conventional method for subtype E measurement. As for subtype A case, Kanagawa primer method gave a value 1.2 x 10(4) copies/ml while it was undetectable by Roche's conventional method. Roche's new version method showed equal sensitivity of Kanagawa primer method. As for subtype B, the results of these three methods showed no difference. Addition of our newly developed subtype E and A primers to the Roche's conventional method enabled to measure subtype E and A with high sensitivity. For quantitative measurement of HIV-1 RNA, it is important to consider the subtype of the virus in test samples."
12607,0.005,1.0000,"A prominent feature of HIV infection is a progressive anergy of T cells and an increase of activation-dependent T-cell death. CD80 (B7.1), the ligand of CD28, is an important co-stimulatory molecule on antigen-presenting cells that delivers an essential second signal for T-cell activation. To test whether immunologic dysfunction in HIV disease involves CD80, we studied CD80 expression on circulating monocytes in heparinized whole blood of 33 HIV-infected patients and 13 controls. Most monocytes in patients and controls expressed significant amounts of CD80. There was no statistical difference of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD80 expression when all HIV-infected patients were compared with healthy controls. However, asymptomatic patients in clinical Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stage A showed a significantly stronger CD80 expression than did healthy controls. Additionally, patients receiving antiretroviral therapy exhibited significantly higher CD80 expression than did patients not receiving therapy and healthy controls. We did not find a correlation with the presence of HIV p24 antigenemia and counts of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Although we studied CD80 expression only on circulating monocytes and not in HIV-infected monocytes or in activated macrophages, our data do not support a role for a general impairment of CD80 expression in induction of anergy in HIV disease."
19231,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) has been identified as the primary cause of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV-1 is a prototypical member of the laentivirinae subfamily of human retroviruses. The infections with HIV are notable for involvement of the nervous system, long periods of clinical latency and weak humoral immune responses complicated by persistent viraemia. HIV is spread by sexual contact, exposure to infected blood or blood products, and perinatal transmission from mother to child. The most important feature of HIV is a remarkable complexity of its viral genome. Besides T cells and monocytes, HIV may also infect other types of cells, including glial cells, gut epithelium, and bone marrow progenitors. It has become increasingly important to have sensitive and specific methods to establish the presence of absence of HIV infection. The diagnosis of HIV infection depends on detection of specific antibodies to HIV, detection of circulating viral antigens, isolation of the virus from clinical specimens of detection of genetic material in infected cells and plasma. The most widely used are ELISA as a screening test and Western blot as a confirmatory test."

Although little is known about these 2 subgroups of HIV-infected people, they are likely to be reflective of the larger population of people with HIV infection; that is, they are predominantly racial minorities, more likely to be unemployed and/or poor, and much more likely to be uninsured or dependent on public insurance programs such as Medicaid, compared with the US population overall. In addition, many persons receive a diagnosis of HIV infection late during the course of the disease, and those who are difficult to reach are less likely to receive standard-of-care antiretroviral therapy.

Hepatitis B carriers and patients suffer not only physically but also experience strong discrimination and stigma. China's rural population is 629 million. Thus, there is a great need to understand the situation surrounding HBV-related discrimination in everyday life in rural China. We studied 6,538 participants (≥18 y old) from 42 villages across 7 provinces (districts). Many studies have addressed discrimination against those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, few studies have addressed HBV-related discrimination. We found that the fear of HBV infection, not lack of knowledge about it, predominantly leads to HBV-related discrimination (although limited knowledge is also a cause). Notably, receiving the HBV vaccination contributes to reduced discrimination. In addition, the existence of fewer misunderstandings about false HBV transmission routes plays a more important role in discrimination than does understanding of true HBV transmission routes. Therefore, to reduce HBV-related discrimination, policy makers should consider eliminating HBV-related fear, strengthening adult HBV immunization programs, developing large-scale education dissemination about HBV transmission routes and non-transmission routes, and paying greater attention to target populations.

4922,0.005,1.0000,"Despite the advent of antiretroviral therapy, complications of HIV-1 infection with concurrent drug abuse are an emerging problem. Opiates are well known to modulate immune responses by preventing the development of cell-mediated immune responses. Their effect on the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection however remains controversial. Using the simian immunodeficiency virus/macaque model of HIV pathogenesis, we sought to explore the impact of morphine on disease progression and pathogenesis. Sixteen rhesus macaques were divided into two groups; four were administered saline and 12 others morphine routinely. Both groups of animals were then inoculated with SIVmacR71/17E and followed longitudinally for disease pathogenesis. The morphine group (M+V) exhibited a trend towards higher mortality rates and retardation in weight gain compared to the virus-alone group. Interestingly, a subset of M+V animals succumbed to disease within weeks post-infection. These rapid progressors also exhibited a higher incidence of other end-organ pathologies. Despite the higher numbers of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the M+V group, CD4/CD8 ratios between the groups remained unchanged. Plasma and CSF viral load in the M+V group was at least a log higher than the control group. Similarly, there was a trend toward increased virus build-up in the brains of M+V animals compared with controls. A novel finding of this study was the increased influx of infected monocyte/macrophages in the brains of M+V animals."
1424,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common in the general population and may coincide with disease in the central and peripheral nervous system. Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is used as treatment for HCV infection. The therapeutic benefit is assumed to result from activation of natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells. Despite its beneficial effects, it has been associated with a number of autoimmune disorders, such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and multiple sclerosis. Several clinical reports including magnetic resonance imaging exist, but neuropathological confirmation of MS associated with IFN-alpha therapy and HCV infection is lacking. We report a case of a female patient with chronic HCV infection who developed ;acute MS'-like demyelinating disease after IFN-alpha administration, with extensive lesions throughout brain and thoracic spinal cord. The patient died after a disease duration of 6 months. Brain autopsy revealed Baló-like demyelinating plaques with positive HCV sequences within florid lesions. The development of fulminant demyelinating disease after administration of IFN-alpha suggests that autoimmune mechanisms such as T cell mediated tissue damage might be initiated or aggravated by IFN-alpha therapy. Additionally, the presence of HCV RNA within the demyelinated lesion indicates a possible role in triggering or propagating disease."
14652,0.005,1.0000,"Food insecurity (FI) is associated with depressive symptoms among HIV mono-infected people. Our objective was to examine to what extent this association holds among HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infected people. We used data from a prospective cohort study of HIV-HCV co-infected people in Canada. FI was measured using the ten-item adult scale of Health Canada's Household Food Security Survey Module and was classified into three categories: food secure, moderate FI, and severe FI. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) and was classified into absence or presence of depressive symptoms. FI, depressive symptoms, and other covariates were updated every 6 months. The association between FI and depressive symptoms was assessed using a stabilized inverse probability weighted marginal structural model. The study sample included 725 HIV-HCV co-infected people with 1973 person-visits over 3 years of follow up. At baseline, 23% of participants experienced moderate food insecurity, 34% experienced severe food insecurity and 52% had depressive symptoms. People experiencing moderate FI had 1.63 times (95% CI 1.44-1.86) the risk of having depressive symptoms and people experiencing severe FI had 2.01 times (95% CI 1.79-2.25) the risk of having depressive symptoms compared to people who were food secure. FI is a risk factor for developing depressive symptoms among HIV-HCV co-infected people. Food supplementation, psychosocial support and counseling may improve patient health outcomes."
14747,0.005,1.0000,"Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) most often have hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B (HBV) virus coinfection, or both, as a cause of their liver disease. Recent survival statistics show that patients infected with HIV treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can expect a significant prolongation of life by interfering with the natural progression of HIV to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Therefore, HIV-positive patients experiencing complications of liver failure are at greater immediate risk of dying from their end-stage liver disease (ESLD) rather than their HIV. Many transplant centers still consider HIV infection as a contraindication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). At our two institutions, we believe that patients with HIV suffering from ESLD should be considered for OLT. This study evaluates the survival of patients undergoing OLT with HIV under HAART therapy. OLT was performed in 16 patients with HIV suffering from ESLD as a result of chronic HCV, chronic HBV, or fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). Collected data include patient demographics, patient and graft survival, pre-OLT assessments, and postoperative complications (including opportunistic infections). Ten patients at Pittsburgh and 6 patients at Miami received OLT. Of the 16 patients who received OLT, 14 remain alive to date. Thirteen of 16 patients are more than 12 months post-OLT, whereas the last patient is currently 6 months post-OLT. Five patients at Miami and 9 of 10 patients at Pittsburgh received HAART therapy before OLT, although 2 of the Pittsburgh patients had their HAART therapy discontinued before OLT because of significant liver dysfunction. The pre-OLT viral loads were undetectable in 13 of 16 patients. The cluster determinant (CD)4 count was less than 200 in 6 patients and greater than 100 in 2 patients before OLT. In all patients, CD4 counts increased above 200 in the post-OLT period. Tacrolimus toxicity associated with the pharmacologic inhibition of cytochrome p450 metabolism caused by protease inhibitors occurred in 6 patients after OLT. Six patients (38%) experienced acute cellular rejection immediately after OLT. Our experience suggests that OLT is effective in selected HIV-positive patients suffering from ESLD. Patient and graft survival was similar to non-HIV-positive patients suffering from the same indications for OLT. Acute cellular rejection was no less frequent that seen in non-HIV-positive patients. Given the complex pharmacologic interactions between the protease inhibitors and tacrolimus, careful monitoring, and attention is required to prevent toxicity or underdosing."
5839,0.005,1.0000,"In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), certain complications of HIV-disease as e.g. opportunistic infections and Kaposi s sarcoma (KS) have significantly diminished. New insights in pathological pathways revealed the role of co-viruses as HHV-8 and HCV so that in our days AIDS-associated KS and chronical hepatitis C (CHC) in HIV-infected persons can be considered as the result of opportunistic infections with HHV-8 or HCV respectively. - Though the overall incidence of AIDS-KS is declining, it remains as a reason of severe disease complication and fatal outcome. Actual therapeutic strategies have to be evaluated regarding safety and efficacy as a major option, while cost-effectiveness of treatment and quality of life aspects for the patient must also be included to assess a successful disease management within the up to now merely palliative setting. HIV-infection evidently triggers the natural course of CHC in terms of more progressive liver disease. Otherwise there seems to be no clinical benefit of HAART on CHC. Until recently IFN-alfa treatment was the only therapy available for patients with CHC. As initial therapy with a combination of IFN-alfa and ribavirin turned out to be more effective than IFN-monotherapy in HCV-infected persons, it has now to be considered to include anti-HCV-combination treatment into the therapeutic program of HIV-HCV-coinfected patients under HAART. - Within the 7th European Conference on Clinical Aspects and Treatment of HIV-Infection, which took place in Lisbon from October 23 to 27 1999, a satellite symposium was organized to evaluate actual treatment options in the management of special HIV-associated complications focussing on AIDS-KS and HCV-HIV-coinfection."
8207,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of high blood pressure (HBP) and hypertension (HTN), awareness of the diagnoses, and use of anti-hypertensive drugs were examined among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Zambia's capital Lusaka. Within a prospective cohort based at two public sector ART clinics, BP was measured at ART initiation and every 6 months thereafter as a routine clinic procedure. Predictors of HBP (systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg) during one year on ART were analyzed using logistic regression, and the proportion with HTN (2+ episodes of HBP >3 months apart) described. A phone survey was used to understand patient awareness of HBP, use of anti-hypertensive drugs, and history of cardiovascular events (CVE; myocardial infarction or stroke). Among 896 cohort participants, 887 (99.0%) had at least one BP measurement, 98 (10.9%) had HBP, and 57 (6.4%) had HTN. Increasing age (10-year increase in age: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.93), male sex (AOR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.43-3.80), and overweight/obesity (AOR = 4.07; 95% CI 1.94-8.53) were associated with HBP. Among 66 patients with HBP, 35 (53.0%) reported awareness of the condition, and nine (25.7%) of these reported having had a CVE. Only 14 (21.2%) of those reached reported ever taking an anti-hypertensive drug, and one (1.5%) was currently on treatment. These data suggest that major improvements are needed in the management of HBP among HIV-infected individuals in settings such as Zambia."
10271,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment of HIV-infected patients has come a long way since the not-so-long-ago beginning of the AIDS epidemic. Implementation of new drug therapies has increased longevity of a patient's life after being diagnosed with the virus. Because HIV-related illnesses are consequently becoming more chronic in nature, patients commonly experience potentially debilitating CNS, PNS, or musculoskeletal problems during the course of the disease. As a result, these patients require delicate care from a number of different health care providers. A multidisciplinary team approach must be used within the podiatrist's treatment regimen. This team must include the physiatrist overseeing the physical therapist, to provide complete and optimal care to improve the patient's functional independence and quality of life. The conditions associated with HIV infection are insidious, slow, and crushing in nature. The medical community can help the patient with HIV infection and AIDS remain on his or her feet. By doing this, costs, both social and economic, can be lowered. The podiatrist must have a strong knowledge of the pathology of AIDS. He or she must use PT along with other disciplines: podiatric medicine, orthotic therapy, and general podiatric care. PT is effective in treating conditions of the lower extremities that affect the CNS, PNS, musculoskeletal system, and, lastly, rheumatologic effects of HIV infection."
12804,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is highly prevalent among chronic dialysis patients (10% to 40%) and is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. However, there are no studies estimating the risk for death among dialysis patients infected with HCV compared with those not infected. We conducted a prospective cohort study to estimate the risk for death among chronic dialysis patients infected with HCV compared with those not infected. In 1992, 200 patients (91%) who had been undergoing dialysis therapy for at least 6 months consented to be screened for HCV infection by enzyme immunoblot assay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Information about potential confounders and potential risk factors for death and HCV infection was obtained from the dialysis center database. Patient outcomes collected included death, transplantation, and loss to follow-up. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the odds of death among dialysis patients who were positive for the HCV antibody and HCV RNA compared with negative patients. Forty-four patients (22%) were HCV antibody positive. Thirty-four patients (17%) were HCV RNA positive. Patients in the HCV RNA-positive group were more likely to be younger (51.8+/-12.6 v 57.2+/-17.3 years of age), men (77% v 54%), and black (65% v 37%). None of the home hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis patients were HCV RNA positive, whereas one of the home hemodialysis and one of the peritoneal dialysis patients were HCV antibody positive. Two patients became infected with HCV during the follow-up period. Patients who were HCV RNA positive and those who were HCV antibody positive were at increased risk for death compared with patients who were negative (adjusted relative risk [aRR]=1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 3.14; P=0.045; and aRR=1.97; 95% CI, 1.16 to 3.33; P=0.012, respectively), after adjusting for time on dialysis, race, transplantation, and age. We conclude that HCV infection increased the risk for death during the study period compared with those not infected. Further studies should assess the measures used to prevent and treat HCV infection."
1419,0.005,1.0000,"We longitudinally studied 51 patients from two hemodialysis centers to determine the prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in hemodialysis patients. Serum samples were tested for antibody to HCV by first- and second-generation enzyme immunoassays and for hepatitis C virus RNA by nested polymerase chain reaction assay. Antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in the initial serum samples by first-generation enzyme immunoassay and second-generation enzyme immunoassay in 6 (11.8%) and 11 (21.6%) patients, respectively. First-generation enzyme immunoassay had a false-positive rate of 33.3% and a false-negative rate of 63.6%. Hepatitis C virus RNA was found in eight second-generation enzyme immunoassay-positive patients (72.7%) and in one patient negative for antibody to hepatitis C virus (2.5%) giving an overall positivity rate of 17.6%. After 19 mo, antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 15 patients (29.4%) on second-generation enzyme immunoassay; hepatitis C virus RNA was found in 13 patients (25.5%). Hepatitis C virus markers persisted in all 12 patients with initial evidence of hepatitis C virus infection. Three patients acquired hepatitis C virus infection during the interim, giving a new infection rate of 4.9% per patient-year. Antibody to hepatitis C virus, hepatitis C virus RNA or both was detected in 55.6% of patients with biochemical changes suggestive of non-A, non-B hepatitis. Of the 15 antibody to hepatitis C virus, second-generation enzyme immunoassay-positive patients, 66.7% had persistently normal serum transaminase levels. In summary, hepatitis C virus infection is common among hemodialysis patients.

Hemodialysis patients (n = 250) were interviewed and serum samples tested for anti-HCV antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All samples were also tested for HCV RNA by reverse transcriptase nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nested-PCR). Out of 250 patients, 21 (8.4%) were found to be seropositive by ELISA, and 19 (7.6%) patients were HCV RNA positive. HCV viraemia was present in 90.5% of the anti-HCV positive patients. The predominant genotype was HCV 1a (8/19), followed by 3a (7/19), and 1b (4/19). None of the anti-HCV negative patients were shown to be viraemic by the PCR. Univariate analysis of risk factors showed that time spent on hemodialysis, the number of blood transfusions and a blood transfusion before November 1993 were associated with HCV positivity. However, multivariate analysis revealed that blood transfusions before November 1993 were significantly associated with HCV infection in this population. Low prevalence levels were encountered in this center, however prospective studies are necessary to confirm these findings."
9368,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Egypt has become a major public health problem. In the present study, sexual and intrafamilial transmission of HCV infection were assessed in the family members of 200 Egyptian patients (index patients) with HCV-RNA positive and biopsy ascertained chronic hepatitis C. Index patients were 139 men (mean age 55+/-11 years) and 61 women (mean age 48+/-8 years). Family members consisted of 200 spouses; 139 women (mean age 45+/-12 years) and 61 men (mean age 58+/-9 years); and 355 children (183 males and 172 females, mean age 11.8+/-10 years). All the family members were tested for the presence of antibodies to HCV in their sera. Thereafter, HCV-RNA detection by PCR and HCV serotype determination were performed in antibody positive contacts. Hepatitis C virus antibodies were detected in 28 (14%) spouses, all of them were also positive for HCV-RNA. Hepatitis C virus serotypes were identical in HCV seropositive patient-spouse pairs (Serotype 4). None of the 355 children involved in this study showed HCV antibodies in their sera. No significant difference was found between the prevalence of male-to-female and female-to-male transmission of HCV. A highly significant association was found between both the age of the spouse and the duration of marriage to index patient and HCV seropositivity in spouses. Moreover, HCV seropositivity in spouses was significantly related to increased serum ALT and HCV-RNA levels, histological severity of chronic hepatitis C and to a history of dental care, as a risk factor for HCV acquisition, in index patients. It was concluded that spouses of patients with HCV viremia and chronic liver disease have an increased risk for acquiring HCV, while intrafamilial acquisition of HCV in non sexual contacts seems to be rare. The authors suggest that spouses of HCV viraemic patients should be followed routinely for markers of HCV infection and liver disease."
16145,0.005,1.0000,"Where active antiretroviral therapy (ART) is accessible, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a survivable illness and effective ART can reduce HIV transmission. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) has emerged as a threat to the survival of individuals harboring both HCV and HIV, due to high prevalence and aggressive disease course. The HCV/HIV coinfection epidemic has been driven by people who inject drugs (PWID), although incident HCV is rising among HIV-infected men who have sex with men in the absence of drug injection. Coinfected individuals warrant aggressive treatment of both viruses; although early ART initiation is recommended to reduce the rate of liver disease progression, the most effective way to decrease HCV-related morbidity and mortality in coinfection is to achieve HCV viral eradication. Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents will soon revolutionize HCV treatment. Clinical data are needed regarding the efficacy of DAAs in coinfected PWID. Drug-drug interaction studies between ART, DAAs, and opiate substitution therapy must be expedited. Coinfected PWID should have equitable and universal access to HIV/AIDS, HCV, and addiction prevention, care, and treatment. Essential basic steps include improving screening for both infections and engaging coinfected PWID in HIV and HCV care early after diagnoses. Developing strategies to expand access to HCV therapy for coinfected PWID is imperative to stem the HCV epidemic and limit the morbidity and mortality of those at greatest risk for HCV disease progression. The ultimate goal must be the elimination of HCV from all coinfected PWID. "

Blood samples were drawn from 98 intravenous drug users (IVDU), 100 female high-class commercial sex workers (CSW) and 50 male outpatients (MOP) at a sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic in Chiang Mai, Thailand. These blood samples were analyzed for GBV-C/HGV RNA; antibodies against second envelope protein of GBV-C/HGV (anti-E2); anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV-Ab); hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb); and antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-Ab). Prevalences of GBV-C/HGV RNA, anti-E2, HCV-Ab, HBcAb and HIV-Ab were 27.6%, 16.3%, 84.7%, 76.5% and 45.0% in IVDU; 0%, 21.5%, 2.0%, 72.0% and 11.0% in CSW; 6.0%, 13.6%, 0%, 64.0% and 14.0% in MOP. While the prevalence of GBV-C/HGV RNA was higher in IVDU than in CSW and MOP, comparable prevalences of anti-E2 among the three populations were found. Intravenous drug injection showed association with GBV-C/HGV RNA, while history of STD associated with anti-E2. In conclusion, intravenous drug injection and STD were found to be risk factors for the previous exposure to GBV-C/HGV, but STD did not increase the risk of the GBV-C/HGV viraemia."
11629,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of the study was to determine the HIV RNA viral load and CD4+ cell count to assess the severity of immune deficiency in patients of Asian ethnicity with HIV/HCV co-infection by different HCV genotypes. 181 HIV-infected patients of Asian ethnicity were studied from several regions of Kazakhstan, predominantly from Karaganda region, including prisons. The diagnosis of HIV infection was confirmed by immunoblotting after a positive ELISA screening test. The patient data for analysis were extracted from the patients' medical charts. Analysis of peripheral blood and urine, blood biochemistry tests were performed for each patient. The flow cytometry was used to determine the CD3, CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes in the whole blood. Detection and quantification of HCV RNA in clinical samples of serum or plasma was performed by reverse transcription of viral RNA followed by amplification using DNA real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) with hybridization-fluorescence detection of PCR products in real-time. Statistical analysis was performed using STATISTICA software package. Student's t test was used to evaluate the differences between the means. HCV antibodies were detected in 73 patients out of 181. HCV genotyping showed presence of first genotype in 18 (24.7%), genotype 2 in 19 (26.0%) and genotype 3 in 36 (49.3%) patients. The third genotype was the most prevalent according to our study. More severe immunosuppression was observed in patients with HCV genotypes 1 and 3 in comparison with those with HCV genotype 2. HCV infection is a negative risk-factor in the course of HIV infection, accelerating the decrease of CD4+ cells. The greatest risk of progression of HIV infection to AIDS occurs in the presence of HCV genotype 1 and 3 which can be explained by more aggressive course of the disease and a poorer prognosis in comparison with the infection with genotype 2.

This was an observational prospective study of patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy containing two NRTIs plus one ritonavir-boosted PI who switched to a dual regimen containing raltegravir plus etravirine. Patients were required not to have prior virological failure to raltegravir and to have efficacy of etravirine shown through the genotypic resistance assay in case of prior non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) virological failure. As a whole, 38 patients were enrolled. The mean duration of current regimen was 4.3 years, and the reason for simplification was toxicity in 29 patients and resistance to NRTIs in 9 patients. After switching, the percentage of patients with HIV RNA <20 copies/ml at week 48 was 81.6% in the intent-to-treat-exposed analysis. The switch led to a significant reduction in the mean serum triglyceride levels (-81.2 mg/dl), in the mean total cholesterol levels (-44.3 mg/dl), and in the prevalence of tubular proteinuria (-30.2%), with a significant increase in the mean phosphoremia (+0.52 mg/dl) and in both mean lumbar and femoral neck bone mineral density (+6.5% and +4.7%, respectively). Two patients (5.2%) had virological failure due to suboptimal adherence, and five subjects (13.1%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events. In our study, simplification to the dual-therapy raltegravir plus etravirine was associated with a good efficacy and tolerability, in addition to a favorable effect on kidney, bone, and serum lipids."
3340,0.005,1.0000,"Dual infections with HIV-1 and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) may proceed in concert to cause severe disease. HIV positive individuals that become infected with HCV advance more rapidly to AIDS than those that are infected with HIV-1 alone. In this study, HLA-A2.1 mice were immunized with a combination vaccine including HIV and HCV immunogens (polycistronic DNA + proteins) or vaccine containing either HIV or HCV immunogens. Mice immunized with the combined HIV/HCV regimen had similar antibody titers as the group receiving either the HIV-1 or HCV only regimen. Proliferative immune responses showed that mice receiving the combined HIV/HCV vaccine exhibited a three fold higher stimulation index (SI) to gp120 than mice immunized with the vaccine containing HIV alone. To determine whether our vaccine strategy induced Th1 or Th2 immune responses, IFN-gamma and IL-4/IL-5 were measured. The combined HIV/HCV vaccine induced a higher level of Th1 responses to HIV-1 gag protein compared with the other groups, as measured by IFN-gamma production. Interestingly, detection of IFN-gamma by ELISPOT assay demonstrated that the combined HIV/HCV vaccine group had increased numbers of spot forming cells (SFC) to HIV-gp120 peptides when compared to that of the HIV-1 only vaccine group. The combined HIV/HCV vaccine group also showed an increase in SFC to HCV-core peptides in comparison with the group receiving the HCV only vaccine. Intracellular IFN-gamma staining confirmed the ELISPOT results and demonstrated that the combined HIV/HCV group had significantly higher percentages of HIV and HCV-specific CD8+ T cells in comparison to the groups receiving the HIV or HCV vaccines. These results suggest a new approach to maximize vaccine efficacy against HIV and HCV."
12718,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) load is an important marker of disease progression and treatment efficacy in patients with HIV-1 infection. In recent years, an increase in the number of samples with detectable HIV-1 RNA has been reported among patients with previously suppressed viral loads, affecting clinical patient care and leading to repeat measurements of viral load and drug resistance. This rise seems to have coincided with the increased use of plasma preparation tubes (PPTs) for sample collection, and we have aimed to explain why PPTs might yield elevated HIV-1 RNA levels. The impacts of different sample-processing procedures on HIV-1 RNA levels were compared retrospectively. Prospectively, the presence of different cells and cell-associated HIV-1 nucleic acids in paired plasma samples from PPTs centrifuged before (PPT1) and after (PPT2) transportation to the laboratory was compared. A retrospective analysis of 4,049 patient samples with <1,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml showed elevated HIV-1 RNA levels in plasma from PPT1 compared with the levels from PPT2 and standard EDTA-containing tubes. Prospective data revealed cell-associated HIV-1 nucleic acids and abundant blood cells in plasma from PPT1 but not from the corresponding PPT2. The levels of HIV-1 RNA correlated with the lymphocyte counts in plasma in PPT1. Cells could be removed by the recentrifugation of PPT1 before analysis. In conclusion, the transportation of PPTs after centrifugation may render cells in the plasma fraction containing cell-associated HIV-1 nucleic acids that contribute significantly to the HIV-1 RNA copy numbers in patients with low viral loads."

16256,0.005,1.0000,"We review the rationale for, and progress in, the development of antiviral therapy for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). A consideration of the replicative cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can lead to the identification of several steps that represent potential targets for antiretroviral therapy, and several substances that can inhibit the replication of HIV in vitro have already been identified. The 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides are a class of nucleoside analogues in which the 3'-hydroxy group is modified so that it cannot form phosphodiester linkages for nucleic acid chains. Some are potent in vitro inhibitors of HIV replication, possibly acting as chain terminators of viral DNA during reverse transcription. One of these dideoxynucleoside analogues, 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT), has now been administered for up to 18 months to patients with AIDS. The drug has been shown to improve immunologic function, to reverse, at least partially, HIV-induced neurologic dysfunction in some patients, and to improve certain other clinical abnormalities associated with AIDS. The principal toxic effect associated with AZT is dose-dependent suppression of bone marrow, resulting particularly in anemia and leukopenia; however, most patients in whom this toxic effect occurs can subsequently tolerate a lower dose of the drug. The demonstration that AZT can be beneficial in patients with AIDS has removed some of the uncertainty about the rationale for an antiretroviral intervention in HIV infection."
7055,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the central nervous system (CNS) can result in neurological dysfunction with devastating consequences in a significant proportion of individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. HIV-1 does not infect neurons directly but induces damage indirectly through the accumulation of activated macrophage/microglia (M/M) cells, some of which are infected, that release neurotoxic mediators including both cellular activation products and viral proteins. One mechanism for the accumulation of activated M/M involves the development in infected individuals of an activated peripheral blood monocyte population that traffics through the blood-brain barrier, a process that also serves to carry virus into CNS and establish local infection. A second mechanism involves the release by infected and activated M/M in the CNS of chemotactic mediators that recruit additional monocytes from the periphery. These activated M/M, some of which are infected, release a number of cytokines and small molecule mediators as well as viral proteins that act on bystander cells and in turn activate them, thus amplifying the cascade. These viral proteins and cellular products have neurotoxic properties as well, both directly and through induction of astrocyte dysfunction, which ultimately lead to neuronal injury and death. In patients effectively treated with antiretroviral therapy, frank dementia is now uncommon and has been replaced by milder forms of neurocognitive impairment, with less frequent and more focal neuropathology. This review summarizes key findings that support the critical role and mechanisms of monocyte/macrophage activation and inflammation as a major component for HIV-1 encephalitis or HIV-1 associated dementia."

Additional information regarding HIV-related life events and their potential relationship to onset of disorder and family history of psychiatric disorder were obtained. A high lifetime prevalence of affective and substance use disorder was found, with almost one half of the sample meeting criteria for both disorders. Lifetime affective disorder diagnosis was associated with a positive family history of affective disorder. HIV-related events were most closely associated with onset or recurrence of affective disorder compared with other disorders. Low current rates of psychiatric disorder and levels of emotional distress were found, with no differences in degree of psychiatric adjustment across stage of infection. We conclude that the lifetime prevalence of certain categories of psychiatric disorder is high in both HIV+ and HIV- homosexual samples. Increased rates of psychiatric disorders do not appear to be a consequence of HIV infection. However, episodes of illness, particularly affective disorder, may develop following an HIV-related event such as confirmation of infection. Although symptomatic subjects have more somatic difficulties, there appears to be no relationship between stage of illness and level of emotional distress."
13611,0.005,1.0000,"With the transition of HIV infection from an acute to a chronic disease after the introduction of antiretroviral medications, there has been an increased focus on long-term neurocognitive and other functional outcomes of HIV patients. Thus, we assessed factors, particularly history of a substance use disorder, associated with time to loss of measures of physical or mental independence among HIV-positive individuals. Data were obtained from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to estimate the time since HIV diagnosis to loss of independence, and to identify associated risk factors. HIV-positive participants who self-identified as physically (n = 698) or mentally (n = 616) independent on selected activities of daily living at baseline were eligible for analyses. A history of substance use disorder was associated with a higher hazard of loss of both physical and mental independence [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.71, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.07-2.78; adjusted HR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.11-2.52, respectively]. After adjusting for substance use disorder and other covariates, older age at diagnosis and female gender were associated with higher hazards of loss of both physical and mental independence, non-white participants had higher hazards of loss of physical independence, whereas participants with an abnormal neurocognitive diagnosis and fewer years of education had higher hazards of loss of mental independence. In summary, history of substance use disorder was associated with loss of measures of both physical and mental independence. The nature of this link and the means to prevent such loss of independence need further investigation."
7684,0.005,1.0000,"It is evident that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is one of the most serious public health issues in decades. HIV infection compromises cell-mediated immunity which ultimately may result in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS, to date, remains an incurable and progressively fatal disorder. HIV infection is spreading beyond the originally identified high-prevalence groups of gay/bisexual males, intravenous drug abusers, and recipients of infected blood or blood products. Today, more and more heterosexual males, women, adolescents, and children have been infected with this lethal virus. This report addresses some of the psychiatric complications associated with HIV infection and discusses the diagnostic and clinical management challenges that clinicians must face as they deal with the increasing population of HIV-infected patients. Depression, anxiety, psychosis, delirium, and dementia are commonly encountered disorders associated with HIV spectrum disorders which must be accurately identified and can be effectively managed with psychopharmacological interventions."
16189,0.005,1.0000,"Readiness for therapy of people living with HIV is of major importance in the process of antiretroviral decision making. This qualitative study is part of a prospective multicentre investigation describing readiness for antiretroviral therapy (ART) and decision making in HIV-infected patients. The qualitative results present the daily experiences of people living with HIV in the treatment decision making process related to starting or changing ART. Based on a critical hermeneutic research design, interviews with twelve persons have been conducted. Two main categories were generated: ""dealing with oneself and others"" and ""understanding and being understood"". They describe the dialectical process of decision making with a focus on interactions with others. This process includes four themes: illness beliefs, health perspectives, therapy beliefs, life perspectives. The findings of this study reveal that partnerships of health care providers with HIV-infected patients are necessary for treatment decisions. Moreover; it is of major importance for health care providers to include patients' experiences and expertise and to allow time for the different dialogues."

Therapeutic plasma concentrations of STAMP 3-4 logs higher than its IC50 value can be achieved after its p.o. administration to dogs as well as cats at the 100 mg/kg nontoxic dose level. In accordance with its safety profile in rodent species, a 4- to 7-week STAMP treatment course with twice daily administration of hard gelatin capsules containing 25-100 mg/kg (50-200 mg/kg/ day) STAMP was very well-tolerated by dogs and cats at cumulative dose levels as high as 8.4 g/kg. Except for the sporadic occurrence of nausea and vomiting after its administration and elevation of serum ALT levels in some of the cats, STAMP therapy was not associated with any clinical or laboratory evidence of toxicity. No STAMP-related toxic lesions were found in any of the organs from STAMP-treated cats or dogs. These findings encourage the further development of stampidine for possible clinical use in HIV-infected persons."
9119,0.005,1.0000,"Food insecurity is associated with HIV treatment non-adherence and poor health outcomes for people living with HIV/AIDS. Given the poor nutritional status common to people who drink alcohol, food insecurity may be particularly problematic for HIV positive individuals who drink alcohol. To examine food insecurity among HIV positive men and women who drink alcohol and its association with antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, health outcomes and health service utilization. Adults living with HIV (N = 183) in Atlanta, Georgia who reported alcohol use in the previous week and were receiving ART participated in a 12-month cohort. Participants were recruited from infectious disease clinics and social services to complete computerized interviews, monthly-unannounced pill counts to monitor ART adherence, and daily cell-phone delivered interactive-text assessments for alcohol use. Forty-three percent of participants experienced food insecurity during at least one month of the study period. Food insecurity was independently associated with suboptimal ART adherence and less suppressed HIV viral load over. Individuals who experienced food insecurity also had histories of more medical and psychiatric hospitalizations, and greater mental health problems. Food insecurity is prevalent among alcohol using people receiving ART and food insecurity is associated with treatment non-adherence, poor health outcomes, and increased medical and psychiatric hospitalizations."
7176,0.005,1.0000,"Smoking represents an important health risk for people living with HIV (PLHIV). Low adherence to smoking cessation pharmacotherapy may limit treatment effectiveness. In this study, 158 participants recruited from three HIV care centers in New York City were randomized to receive 12-weeks of varenicline (Chantix) either alone as standard care (SC) or in combination with text message (TM) support or TM plus cell phone-delivered adherence-focused motivational and behavioral therapy (ABT). Generalized linear mixed-effect models found a significant decline in varenicline adherence from week 1-12 across treatment groups. At 12-weeks, the probability of smoking abstinence was significantly higher in SC+TM+ABT than in SC. The study demonstrates the feasibility of delivering adherence-focused interventions to PLHIV who smoke. Findings suggest intensive behavioral support is an important component of an effective smoking cessation intervention for this population, and a focus on improving adherence self-efficacy may lead to more consistent adherence and higher smoking abstinence."
7867,0.005,1.0000,"Recent editorials, conferences and clinical practice articles have discussed providers' concerns and practices regarding prescribing antiretroviral combination therapy for HIV. We aimed to deepen our understanding of these largely anecdotal reports and of the challenges facing experienced HIV clinicians today using qualitative methodology. Eight focus groups using a structured discussion guide were conducted. Data were analyzed by constant comparative analysis and open codes. Participants were a diverse group of 23 physicians, eight nurse practitioners and four physician assistants with significant experience providing care to HIV-seropositive patients in various San Francisco Bay Area health care settings. The following major themes emerged from the data: (1) providers expressed new optimism about helping HIV-seropositive patients live; (2) the main factors affecting providers' decisions about when to start combination therapy were the risks versus benefits of delaying therapy, and patients' health status, readiness to adhere and treatment preferences; (3) providers lacked resources to prepare patients to begin therapy and enhance adherence; (4) providers varied regarding assessment of adherence; and (5) providers were anxious about making decisions under conditions of uncertainty and were concerned about patient health outcomes. We concluded that experienced HIV clinicians were hopeful and excited about their increasing ability to help patients. This hope, however, was tempered by scepticism about the future and by their daily struggles to make treatment decisions under conditions of great uncertainty. Without access to adjunct supports or a multidisciplinary team, providers may not be able to optimally assess and enhance antiretroviral medication adherence."
12977,0.005,1.0000,"The transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through transplantation of human tissues and organs is rare but not impossible. A 27-year-old Bulgarian woman received a kidney transplant from a cadaveric donor owing to chronic renal failure due to glomerulonephritis of unknown etiology. Five days after the donation, the tissues showed HIV-1 infection, so she was immediately initiated on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with lopinavir/ritonavir, zidovudine, enfuvirtide, and lamivudine. Subsequently, according to the genotypic test which revealed a complex resistance pattern of the HIV-1, we changed the regimen to darunavir/ritonavir, etravirine, lamivudine, and enfuvirtide. The HIV-1 genome (550 UI/mL), which was detected at 5 days after transplantation, rapidly declined to undetectable levels at 3 weeks after HAART. The CD4+ T-cell nadir was 432 cells/microL (40%) to 1,400 cells/microL after 2 years. The posttransplantation course was complicated by cytomegalovirus pneumonia. At 32 months after transplantation, the patient had experienced hypertension with secondary retinopathy, bilateral cataracts, diabetes, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis with multiple vertebral fractures, a hip prosthesis, and a bone infarction of the femur. Major management problems had been related to steroid and HAART treatment side effects. Therapeutic interactions between the immunosuppressants and the antiretroviral drugs were complex for management, requiring frequent checks of drug levels and dose-adjustments. We finally obtained a stable clinical and viroimmunologic condition. The transmission of multiresistant strains of HIV from unknown patients requires complex multidisciplinary management."
6523,0.005,1.0000,"We explored the relationship between HIV-1 drug resistance in treatment-experienced patients and disease progression in a cohort of patients undergoing resistance testing to guide treatment decisions. A total of 601 treatment-failing individuals tested for genotypic HIV-1 drug resistance between 1998 and 2004 were selected. At genotypic testing, median HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 counts were 3.8 log copies/ml and 293 cells/mul, respectively; 84% had resistance mutations to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 42% had resistance mutations to non-NRTIs, 51% had major resistance mutations to protease inhibitors (PI), 12% had no major resistance mutations to any drug class, 22% had mutations to one class, 42% had mutations to two classes, and 23% had mutations to three classes. During a follow-up of 714.7 patients/year, 80 patients showed an AIDS-defining event or died. In multivariable models adjusting for prior AIDS, baseline CD4 counts, HIV-1 RNA, and calendar year, viral resistance variables associated with increased hazards of clinical progression were the presence of reverse transcriptase substitution T215F (p = 0.002) and the presence of three or more protease substitutions among L33F/I/V, V82A/F/L/T, I84V, and L90M (p = 0.003). Resistance to three drug classes remained independently predictive of clinical progression only when calendar year was not used as an adjustment factor. Prevention and treatment of multiple drug class resistance are clinical priorities for HIV-infected patients. In recent years, improved treatment options may have helped in reducing part of the resistance-associated clinical progression."
6161,0.005,1.0000,"A challenge to the treatment of chronic hepatitis C with direct-acting antivirals is the emergence of drug-resistant hepatitis C virus (HCV) variants. HCV with preexisting polymorphisms that are associated with resistance to NS3/4A protease inhibitors have been detected in patients with chronic hepatitis C. We performed a comprehensive pooled analysis from phase 1b and phase 2 clinical studies of the HCV protease inhibitor faldaprevir to assess the population frequency of baseline protease inhibitor resistance-associated NS3 polymorphisms and their impact on response to faldaprevir treatment. A total of 980 baseline NS3 sequences were obtained (543 genotype 1b and 437 genotype 1a sequences). Substitutions associated with faldaprevir resistance (at amino acid positions 155 and 168) were rare (<1% of sequences) and did not compromise treatment response: in a phase 2 study in treatment-naive patients, six patients had faldaprevir resistance-associated polymorphisms at baseline, of whom five completed faldaprevir-based treatment and all five achieved a sustained virologic response 24 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR24). Among 13 clinically relevant amino acid positions associated with HCV protease resistance, the greatest heterogeneity was seen at NS3 codons 132 and 170 in genotype 1b, and the most common baseline substitution in genotype 1a was Q80K (99/437 [23%]). The presence of the Q80K variant did not reduce response rates to faldaprevir-based treatment. Across the three phase 2 studies, there was no significant difference in SVR24 rates between patients with genotype 1a Q80K HCV and those without Q80K HCV, whether treatment experienced (17% compared to 26%; P = 0.47) or treatment naive (62% compared to 66%; P = 0.72).

2829,0.005,1.0000,"Due to the differences between bioavailability of efavirenz (EFV) and tenofovir (TDF), the single-tablet regimen of EFV/emtricitabine (FTC)/TDF is not approved as initial antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Europe by the European Medical Agency. To compare clinical, immunological, and virological outcomes between co-formulated TDF/FTC+EFV and the co-formulated EFV/FTC/TDF single-tablet regimen in patients infected with HIV-1 naive to ART, the data of patients (n = 231) who initiated either TDF/FTC+EFV (n = 155) or EFV/FTC/TDF (n = 76) between January 1, 2007 and June 1, 2010 were analyzed. Changes from baseline to week 48 (TDF/FTC+EFV vs. EFV/FTC/TDF) in HIV plasma load (- 3.25 log vs. -3.32 log) and CD4+ T cell count (+180 vs. +138 cells/mm3) were similar in the two groups. Treatment discontinuation was recorded in 50 (22%) patients (40 on TDF/FTC+EFV and 10 on EFV/FTC/TDF, P = 0.03) but time to discontinuation did not differ between the two groups. Only patients on TDF/FTC+EFV discontinued treatment because of neurological symptoms. Virological failure occurred in 11 (4.7%) patients (seven on TDF/FTC+EFV and four on EFV/FTC/TDF, P = 0.75) with new resistance-associated mutations in five among the six with successful resistance genotype tests. Only baseline resistance-associated mutations was a risk factor for virological failure (P = 0.0146). These data show comparable outcomes between TDF/FTC+EFV or EFV/FTC/TDF used in patients infected with HIV-1 and not treated previously, consistent with a low rate of virological failure in the absence of pretreatment resistance. This would suggest that the European Medical Agency should approve co-formulated EFV/FTC/TDF single-tablet regimen for patients naive to ART."

Samples obtained from participants at baseline (pretreatment) and at the time of failure on first-line ART and second-line ART were analyzed using genotypic and phenotypic assays for antiretroviral drug resistance. Test results were obtained from 73 samples from 38 individuals (31 baseline samples, 36 first-line failure samples, and six second-line failure samples). Four (13%) of the 31 baseline samples had mutations associated with resistance to nucleoside or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs, respectively). Among the 36 first-line failure samples, 31 (86%) had NNRTI resistance mutations and 29 (81%) had lamivudine resistance mutations; only eight (22%) had other NRTI resistance mutations. None of the six individuals failing a second-line protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen had PI resistance mutations. Six (16%) of the participants had discordant genotypic and phenotypic test results. Genotypic resistance to drugs included in first-line ART regimens was detected prior to treatment and among participants failing first-line ART. PI resistance was not detected in individuals failing second-line ART. Surveillance for transmitted and acquired drug resistance remains a priority for scale-up of ART."

We conducted a retrospective matched-control analysis of the outcomes of 76 patients with positive HBV core antibody (HBcAb) and negative HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) at the time of allo-HSCT for hematologic or solid malignancies. Control patients (matched controls), with negative serology for HBV and other viral hepatitides, were matched by age, diagnosis, disease risk, intensity of conditioning regimen, and donor type. In addition, the HBcAb-positive patients and all seronegative patients (all controls, n = 1858) undergoing transplantation during the same period were compared to adjust for other confounding effects. Patient characteristics and baseline hepatic function studies were similar in the HBcAb-positive and matched control groups. The cumulative incidence of hepatitis B reactivation (defined as the emergence of HBsAg in serum) was 11.6% at 3 years. There were no significant differences in overall survival, relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease between the HBcAb-positive and control groups. Our data suggest that seropositivity for HBcAb and seronegativity for HBsAg at the time of transplantation does not seem to adversely affect outcome after allo-HSCT."

The purpose of this study was to determine whether primary-care-based buprenorphine/naloxone was associated with decreased HIV risk behavior. We conducted a longitudinal analysis of 166 opioid-dependent persons (129 men and 37 women) receiving buprenorphine/naloxone treatment in a primary care clinic. We compared baseline and 12- and 24-week overall, drug-related, and sex-related HIV risk behaviors using the AIDS/HIV Risk Inventory (ARI). Buprenorphine/naloxone treatment was associated with significant reductions in overall and drug-related ARI scores from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks. Intravenous drug use in the past 3 months was endorsed by 37%, 12%, and 7% of patients at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively (p< .001). Sex while you or your partner were ""high"" was endorsed by 64%, 13%, and 15% of patients at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively (p< .001). Inconsistent condom use during sex with a steady partner was high at baseline and did not change over time. We conclude that primary-care-based buprenorphine/naloxone treatment is associated with decreased drug-related HIV risk, but additional efforts may be needed to address sex-related HIV risk when present."
13283,0.005,1.0000,"Combination therapy, comprising at least three anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) drugs, has become the standard treatment of AIDS. Since 1996, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was designed to rapidly control HIV replication. It has had a significant impact on patient health and progression of AIDS in developed countries but its success has not been complete. HAART strategy still suffers from issues of patient compliance, cost, deleterious side effects and emerging drug resistance. Therefore it is logical to look for agents that inhibit different viral targets. In addition to the fusion, reverse transcription and protein formation processes, the HIV replicative cycle offers various other events that can be considered as potential targets for chemotherapeutic intervention. Amongst them integration is a key step and integrase (IN), one of the three viral enzymes, has been rapidly identified as a rational target for many years. To date, four molecules have entered in clinical trials. The present article reviews the increasing number of patents on small molecule HIV-1 integrase inhibitors in the 1998-2005 period, from the pioneer ones (discovery of selective strand transfer inhibitors) to the last patents including the actual molecules under clinical trials."
14957,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is currently one of the most clinically relevant co-morbidities in the HIV-infected population. Overall, one third of HIV-infected individuals in Europe are HCV co-infected. The progression of chronic HCV infection to liver cirrhosis with subsequent risk for liver decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma is substantially accelerated in HIV/HCV co-infected compared to HCV mono-infected individuals, particularly with advanced levels of immunodeficiency. Indeed, immune reconstitution under HAART has been associated with slowing down fibrosis progression in HIV/HCV co-infected individuals. Therefore HAART initiation is recommended earlier in HCV co-infected patients. Moreover, the sequelae of chronic hepatitis C infection can be stopped by successful treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin combination therapy so that every HIV/HCV co-infected patient should be evaluated for possible HCV treatment. - In this review we summarize the current epidemiology, natural course of HCV in HIV co-infection and current guidelines for management of chronic hepatitis C infection in HIV co-infected patients."
1065,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a global public health problem with changing epidemiology due to several factors including vaccination policies and migration. This Clinical Practice Guideline presents updated recommendations for the optimal management of HBV infection. Chronic HBV infection can be classified into five phases: (I) HBeAg-positive chronic infection, (II) HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis, (III) HBeAg-negative chronic infection, (IV) HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis and (V) HBsAg-negative phase. All patients with chronic HBV infection are at increased risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), depending on host and viral factors. The main goal of therapy is to improve survival and quality of life by preventing disease progression, and consequently HCC development. The induction of long-term suppression of HBV replication represents the main endpoint of current treatment strategies, while HBsAg loss is an optimal endpoint. The typical indication for treatment requires HBV DNA >2,000IU/ml, elevated ALT and/or at least moderate histological lesions, while all cirrhotic patients with detectable HBV DNA should be treated. Additional indications include the prevention of mother to child transmission in pregnant women with high viremia and prevention of HBV reactivation in patients requiring immunosuppression or chemotherapy. The long-term administration of a potent nucleos(t)ide analogue with high barrier to resistance, i.e., entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide, represents the treatment of choice. Pegylated interferon-alfa treatment can also be considered in mild to moderate chronic hepatitis B patients. Combination therapies are not generally recommended. All patients should be monitored for risk of disease progression and HCC. Treated patients should be monitored for therapy response and adherence. HCC remains the major concern for treated chronic hepatitis B patients. Several subgroups of patients with HBV infection require specific focus. Future treatment strategies to achieve 'cure' of disease and new biomarkers are discussed."

We investigated whether consumption of a Mediterranean diet is associated with lower risk of body-shape changes in Croatian patients treated with CART. Between May 2004 and June 2005, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 136 adults with HIV-1 infection who were treated with CART for at least 1 year. Lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy were assessed by self-report and physical examination. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet was determined by a 150-item questionnaire; a 0-9 point diet scale was created that stratified respondents as having low adherence (<4 points) and moderate to high adherence (> or =4 points). Lipoatrophy was present in 41% and lipohypertrophy in 32% of participants. Non-smokers with a dietary score > or =4 had the lowest risk for lipoatrophy. Stavudine use, female gender, and duration of CART were also independently associated with a higher risk of lipoatrophy. A dietary score of > or =4 was associated with lower risk of lipohypertrophy (adjusted OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.7; P = 0.012). Female gender, longer duration of CART, and longer known duration of HIV infection prior to CART were also independently associated with higher risk of lipohypertrophy. In conclusion, Croatians who did not smoke and moderately or highly adhered to the Mediterranean diet were least likely to have the clinical syndrome of lipoatrophy. Moderate to high adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower risk of lipohypertrophy."

We assessed progression of coronary artery calcium (CAC) in patients with HIV infection to identify factors that may help explain progression of atherosclerosis. Prospective, observational study of 132 HIV-infected men receiving chronic antiretroviral therapy (ART); we measured traditional atherosclerosis risk factors and assessed progression of CAC on sequential 64-slice CT scans at an average interval of 11 months (range 6-36). CAC score progression was defined as absolute and percentage change from baseline. During follow-up 45 patients (34%) showed absolute progression of CAC and 34 of them showed >15% yearly progression, a threshold previously associated with a high risk of myocardial infarction. Age, LDL cholesterol, visceral abdominal fat and current T-helper (CD4+) cell count were significantly associated with absolute CAC progression. Progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in HIV patients is associated with traditional coronary risk factors as well as HIV related factors such as the CD4+ cell count. Therefore, immunologic perturbations secondary to HIV infection may contribute to atherosclerosis progression."

The present study was designed to establish if HLAs were associated with the severity of HIV infection and progression to AIDS in Afr Am and Cauc adults. The frequency of serologically determined antigens (Ags) in the regional control population was compared to the HIV-infected population and the HIV-infected slow progressors were compared to rapid progressors by race. chi 2 analysis with Bonferroni adjustment, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, linear logistic regression, Cox model of proportional hazards and standardized deltas were applied as applicable. Immune parameters were monitored over a mean follow-up period of 23 +/- 2 months for Afr Ams (n = 35) and 25 +/- 5 months for Caucs (n = 24). A better prognosis in the HIV+Afr Am group was associated with HLA-DQ1 with a risk ratio of 0.295. In the HIV+Cauc group, a preferable prognosis was associated with HLA-DQ3 with a risk ratio of 0.11, and a poor prognosis was associated with HLA-DQ2 with a risk ratio of 7. Afr Am haplotypes that appeared to have the greatest association with rapid progression of HIV infection were A69(28)-B40 and related haplotypes as well as B12-DR14(6). Cauc haplotypes with the strongest association with rapid and slow progression of HIV infection were A28-B17-DR9 and A30(19)-B67, respectively. The DR Ags of at least one haplotype that led to rapid progression in both races were associated with DQ9(3). An 'immune response' gene (DQ region) may control the progression of HIV infection in adults. The rapidly progressive DQ-associated peptide might block the progression of HIV if given as a novel vaccine."
16849,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections lead to cirrhosis and increase the risk for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Angiogenesis is an essential step in oncogenesis and contributes to tumor progression in adult organs; however, to what extent angiogenesis occurs in the liver during chronic viral hepatitis has not been studied. Ninety-nine matched patients affected by chronic hepatitis due to either HBV or HCV were studied together with 13 controls (5 patients were affected by familial hyperbilirubinemia with normal liver histology; 6 patients with stage II primary biliary cirrhosis; and 2 patients with pseudo inflammatory tumor). Microvessel density was assessed in liver biopsies by immunostaining using two different antibodies against endothelial cell antigens, QB-END/10 and Factor VIII. In addition, the liver homogenates and sera of HCV- or HBV-positive patients and controls were tested for their capacity to stimulate the migration and proliferation of freshly isolated human endothelial cells in vitro. Evidence of angiogenesis was significantly more frequent in HCV-positive patients compared with HBV-infected subjects or controls (74% vs. 39% vs. 8%) (chi2 = 20.78; P < .0001) (HCV+ vs. HBV+ vs. controls). The degree of microvessel density was also higher in HCV- than in HBV-positive patients or controls (chi2 = 12.28; P < .005). In addition, HCV-positive sera and liver homogenates stimulated a higher migration and proliferation of human endothelial cells in vitro compared with HBV-positive or control sera and liver homogenates. These observations indicate that angiogenesis is particularly linked to HCV infection, suggesting a possible contribution to HCV-related liver oncogenesis."
1995,0.005,1.0000,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often co-infect the same individuals because they share comparable routes of transmission. Co-infection with HIV in those patients infected with HCV influences the accuracy of HCV diagnostic testing, levels of HCV viremia, severity of liver histopathology, and rate of progression to cirrhosis. By contrast, the effect of HCV co-infection on HIV disease is unclear. Nevertheless, the combination therapy containing recombinant interferon alfa-2b (rIFN-alpha 2b) plus ribavirin has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, whereas alpha interferon monotherapy has been shown to be efficacious in patients co-infected with HCV and HIV. It is therefore logical to propose and test the hypothesis that combination rIFN-alpha 2b/ribavirin therapy will also benefit patients who are co-infected with HCV and HIV. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study is presently under way to investigate this hypothesis."
7453,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy has transformed the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Effective antiretroviral therapy results in both reduced risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease and prolonged survival following CMV disease. These effects seem to be mediated by the reconstitution of immune responses against CMV, which results in re-established host control of CMV replication. As a result, some individuals have been able to discontinue maintenance therapy for CMV with a low risk of disease recurrence to date. The risk of development or progression reappears in the context of antiretroviral failure--a problem increasingly recognized in clinical practice. However, improved immune function is not always beneficial. Indeed, previously uncommon inflammatory complications have been associated with immune reconstitution following highly active antiretroviral therapy. The natural history of CMV disease at a time of rapid changes in treatment strategies remains uncertain and, therefore, individuals at risk continue to require careful management."
12796,0.005,1.0000,"Interferon and pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) are highly effective in patients with acute hepatitis caused by hepatitis C virus (acute hepatitis C, AHC), but the optimal timing of treatment is still under debate. In this open-labelled, uncontrolled trial, 19 patients with AHC, including 12 intravenous drug users (IVDUs), were treated early in the course of the infection with peg-IFN-alpha2b for 12 weeks. Diagnosis was made according to standardized criteria. The HCV RNA decay was analysed during the first 4 weeks of treatment by quantitative branched-DNA and by qualitative RT-PCR. Of the patients, 11 (58%) had genotype 1. Sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved in 14 out of 19 patients (74%) and the mean time to achieve a negative RT-PCR for HCV RNA was 2.5 weeks. The SVR was associated by univariate analysis with peg-IFN dosage < or = 1.33 microg/kg/week (P = 0.026) and HCV RNA level at onset of therapy (P = 0.017). Using a logistic regression model, only peg-IFN dosage > or = 1.33 microg/kg/weekly was significantly associated with SVR (P = 0.0379, OR: 14.7; 95% CI: 1.16-185.2). The SVR was 100% and 83.3%, respectively, in genotype 1 and non-1 infected patients treated with a dosage equal to or higher than 1.33 microg/kg, compared with 40% and 50%, respectively, in those who received a lower dosage. Efforts should be made to propose a 12-week treatment with peg-IFN-alpha2b for AHC, and to maximize peg-IFN dosage. Early treatment is associated with early disappearance of HCV RNA."

The aim of this study was to evaluate GZR plus ribavirin (RBV) in patients with HCV GT1 infection. Noncirrhotic, IL28B CC patients with HCV genotype 1 infection were randomized to GZR 100 mg once daily and RBV for 12 or 24 weeks. Patients in the 12-week arm with detectable HCV RNA at treatment week 4 (TW4) had treatment extended to 24 weeks (response-guided therapy, RGT). The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR12) at follow-up week 12 (HCV RNA <25 IU/mL) in the per-protocol (PP) population (excluding patients with important protocol deviations). Twenty-six patients were randomized and 22 were included in the PP population. SVR12 was 58.3% (7 of 12) and 90% (9 of 10) in the RGT and 24-week arms, respectively. Seven PP patients had virologic failure, including one patient in the 24-week arm who relapsed after follow-up week 12. All three breakthrough patients had wild-type (WT) virus at baseline and developed breakthrough at TW6 or TW12 with Y56H, A156T and D168A/N mutations. Of the five relapse patients, four had WT at baseline (at relapse three had WT and one had V55A and D168A), and one had S122A/T at baseline and S122T at relapse. There were no serious adverse events (AEs), discontinuations due to AEs or grade 3/4 elevations in total and/or direct bilirubin. Grazoprevir plus RBV was associated with a rapid and sustained suppression of HCV RNA. These results support further evaluation of grazoprevir-based regimens (NCT01716156; protocol P039)."

Counts of remaining saquinavir capsules were determined between weeks 0 and 4; at weeks 4, 8, and 16, self-reported adherence was estimated from 2-day report of doses skipped, therapeutic coverage, and percent of doses taken were determined by electronic monitoring devices applied to saquinavir bottles, and the saquinavir 24-hour area under the curve (AUC) was estimated. Relationships were evaluated among these 4 adherence measures and the primary endpoint of week 16 HIV RNA change. Thirty percent of 254 subjects had HIV RNA < or =500 copies/mL at week 16. Only self-reported adherence and saquinavir AUC were significantly associated with week 16 HIV RNA change (P = 0.019 and 0.023, respectively), and these measures were higher in subjects with week 16 HIV RNA < or =500 copies/mL (P = 0.03 and 0.008, respectively). The ability to detect a correlation between electronically monitored adherence and virologic response was limited by the small sample size. Self-reported adherence and saquinavir AUC were significant predictors of virologic response, in this evaluation. These findings provide insight into methods of assessing and improving adherence to antiretroviral regimens."

For the 23 subjects with chronic HCV infection, 72% of 474 saliva samples were positive (or were imputed to be positive) for HCV RNA. Serum HCV RNA load predicted the detection of HCV RNA in saliva (odds ratio of 378.7 [95% confidence interval, 18.9-9996.6] for each additional log10 value). This association was also observed in 1 subject with acute HCV infection. Thus, our data demonstrate that salivary HCV RNA detection was associated with serum HCV RNA load in individuals who were chronically or acutely infected with HCV."

Analyses were carried out among patients who received ATV/r in the CASTLE study to better understand the clinical significance of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia associated with administration of boosted ATV. Hyperbilirubinemia was defined as total bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated) elevation greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (grade 3-4). Patients in the ATV/r arm were assessed based on the presence or absence of hyperbilirubinemia through week 96. Analyses included number of confirmed virologic responders (CVR; HIV RNA<50 copies per milliliter), impact of hyperbilirubinemia on symptoms, elevations in liver enzymes, patient quality of life, and medication adherence. Through 96 weeks in the CASTLE study, 44% of patients who received ATV/r had hyperbilirubinemia at any time point, and between 12.5% and 21.6% had hyperbilirubinemia at any single study visit. At 96 weeks, 74% of patients overall and 84% and 69% of patients with and without hyperbilirubinemia, respectively, achieved CVR. Symptoms of jaundice or scleral icterus occurred in 5% of patients overall and in 11% with hyperbilirubinemia and 0% without hyperbilirubinemia. Four percent of patients with and 3% of patients without hyperbilirubinemia had grade 3-4 elevations in liver transaminases. Less than 1% of patients discontinued treatment due to hyperbilirubinemia. There were no differences in quality of life or adherence between patients with or without hyperbilirubinemia. In the CASTLE study, hyperbilirubinemia observed in the ATV/r group did not negatively impact clinical outcomes in HIV-infected patients."

Low levels of serum zinc concentrations may increase risk of depression in general population. However, research on the role of zinc in depression among HIV- infected person is limited. We assessed the association between serum zinc concentrations and depression in HIV-infected persons. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 311 HIV-positive people (177 men and 134 women) aged 18-60 years residing in Kathmandu, Nepal. The atomic absorption method was used to measure serum zinc concentrations and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-Ia method was used to measure depression, with cut off score 20 or higher consistent with clinically significant depression. Relationships were assessed using multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. Serum zinc concentrations were significantly inversely associated with depression in all participants and in men but not in women. Participants with the highest tertile of serum zinc concentrations had a significantly decreased risk of depression in men but not in women. Serum zinc concentrations were inversely associated with depressive symptoms scores in HIV-infected men. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm the role of zinc in depression among persons infected with HIV."
900,0.005,1.0000,"This paper presents the first of a three-phase study exploring the experiences of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Northern Thailand. The principal aim of the study was to gain an in-depth understanding of the factors contributing to adherence in patients taking highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). These insights were used in phase two to inform a number of interventions aimed at improving medication adherence in patients commencing HAART for the first time. The study comprised a cohort of 32 PLWHA over the age of 18 years who had taken HAART for at least three months. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used. The qualitative component used a multiple case study approach to explore and describe the experiences of patients receiving HAART. The quantitative component comprised the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale and a demographic survey of the respondents. This demographic data were used to provide descriptive statistics of the research population and assist with the interpretation of the qualitative data. The findings identified a number of social, clinical, and economic factors influencing adherence to HAART. These findings led to a number of recommendations that health care providers and policy-makers can implement to improve medication adherence rates in patients taking HAART. The findings demonstrated that improved adherence not only led to improved clinical outcomes, but also the overall quality of life of PLWHA."
11525,0.005,1.0000,"The activities of protease inhibitors in vivo may depend on plasma concentrations and viral susceptibility. This nonrandomized, open-label study evaluated the relationship of the inhibitory quotient (IQ [the ratio of drug exposure to viral phenotypic susceptibility]) to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral load (VL) change for ritonavir-enhanced protease inhibitors (PIs). Subjects on PI-based regimens replaced their PIs with ritonavir-enhanced indinavir (IDV/r) 800/200 mg, fosamprenavir (FPV/r) 700/100 mg, or lopinavir (LPV/r) 400/200 mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetics were assessed at day 14; follow-up lasted 24 weeks. Associations between IQ and VL changes were examined. Fifty-three subjects enrolled, 12 on IDV/r, 33 on FPV/r, and 8 on LPV/r. Median changes (n-fold) (FC) of 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) to the study PI were high. Median 2-week VL changes were -0.7, -0.1, and -1.0 log(10) for IDV/r, FPV/r, and LPV/r. With FPV/r, correlations between the IQ and the 2-week change in VL were significant (Spearman's r range, -0.39 to -0.50; P < or = 0.029). The strongest correlation with response to FPV/r was the IC(50) FC (r = 0.57; P = 0.001), which improved when only adherent subjects were included (r = 0.68; P = 0.001). In multivariable analyses of the FPV/r arm that included FC, one measure of the drug concentration, corresponding IQ, baseline VL, and CD4, the FC to FPV was the only significant predictor of VL decline (P < 0.001). In exploratory analyses of all arms, the area under the concentration-time curve IQ was correlated with the week 2 VL change (r = -0.72; P < 0.001). In conclusion, in PI-experienced subjects with highly resistant HIV-1, short-term VL responses to RTV-enhanced FPV/r correlated best with baseline susceptibility. The IQ improved correlation in analyses of all arms where a greater range of virologic responses was observed."
6958,0.005,1.0000,"Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is an ongoing public health problem in HIV disease treatment. However, little is known about TDR among men who have sex with men (MSM) patients in China. In addition, TDR prevalence among patients with acute HIV infection (AHI) or early HIV infection (EHI) was believed higher than that of patients with chronic HIV infection (CHI), but as AHI is typically either unidentified or crudely defined in large populations, very few direct comparisons have been made. We did a retrospective analysis of TDR in 536 antiretroviral-naive MSM patients from our immunodeficiency clinics at You'an Hospital, Capital Medical University (CMU), in Beijing, China, 2008-2011. The cohort included 266 patients with AHI/EHI and 270 patients with CHI. We analyzed the subtype, estimated the TDR prevalence, and characterized the model of TDR and the predicted drug sensitivity. Additionally, we made a comparison of TDR between the patients with AHI/EHI and patients with CHI. Our results indicated that among the 536 patients, HIV-1 subtype CRF01_AE accounted for 52.1%, subtype B accounted for 24.8%, CRF07_BC/ CRF08_BC accounted for 21.6% (116/536), and 1.3% were denoted as unique recombinant forms (URFs). A total of 7.8% patients had one or more transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance mutations, representing 6.2% for PI-related mutations, 0.9% for NRTI-related mutations, and 1.7% for NNRTI-related mutations. Although patients with AHI/EHI had a higher TDR prevalence as compared to that of patients with CHI, the difference was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference in TDR model and predicted drug susceptibility between the two groups of patients either. This study provides important strategic information for public health planning by healthcare officials in China and warrants a comprehensive study with larger patient cohorts from various healthcare centers within China."

We describe the experiences of 69 HIV-infected individuals who were enrolled in a community-based modified directly observed therapy (MDOT) program. Participants were referred by their primary care physicians based on nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy, and/or active substance use. A near-peer outreach worker initially delivered medications to participants 5 to 7 days per week, with visits subsequently tapered to 1 to 3 days per week after 3 or more months. Questionnaires were completed and laboratory values were obtained at baseline, 1 month, and every 3 months after enrollment. At enrollment, 96% of participants had a history of substance use, 71% had a history of incarceration, and 93% were experienced with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). At the time of their 6-month assessment visit, 31 of 69 participants were receiving observed therapy visits. The median baseline plasma viral load (PVL) was 4.8 log, and the median individual change in PVL from baseline to 6 months among participants receiving MDOT was a decrease of 2.7 log. Reasons why participants were not receiving visits included medication holidays, hospitalization or assisted living, incarceration, discontinuation of program involvement, and death. These results support that MDOT should be included in the spectrum of options available to enhance adherence to HAART among patients who are unsuccessful with self-administration of their medications."

A history of any syringe sharing (54%) and syringe sharing in prison (25%) were common. In bivariate analyses, a history of any syringe sharing and syringe sharing in prison were both associated with all three viral infections. The high prevalence of HCV, HBV, HIV, and coinfections among IDU in Arak is concerning and indicates rapid disease spread outside of Iran's main urban centers. Prevention efforts should expand vaccination for IDUs who are nonimmune to HBV and continue to target syringe sharing with efforts such as needle exchange programs, including inside prisons. "

Persons enrolled in the HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study were asked whether they received care for their most bothersome symptom. Surprisingly, minorities and women were no more likely to go without care than other groups. Those with Medicaid, Medicare, private health maintenance organization (HMO) insurance, or no insurance were less likely to receive care for symptoms than those with private-non-HMO insurance. Vulnerable groups were no less likely to use services for HIV-related symptoms when need for care was considered.

A sample of 851 out-of-treatment IDUs was recruited in Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, between 2003 and 2005. Participants were tested for HIV and HCV antibodies. Demographic, drug use, and injection practice data were collected via interviews. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analysis. Participants had a mean age of 40 years and 74% are male, 63% are African American, 29% are non-Hispanic white, and 8% are of other race/ethnicity. Overall, 42% of participants had ever used an HDSS and 12% had shared one. HIV prevalence was 5% among IDUs who had never used an HDSS compared with 16% among IDUs who had shared one. The HIV model used a propensity score approach to adjust for differences between IDUs who had used an HDSS and those who had never used one. The HCV models included all potential confounders as covariates. A history of sharing HDSSs was associated with prevalent HIV (odds ratio=2.50; 95% confidence interval=1.01, 6.15). Use and sharing of HDSSs were also associated with increased odds of HCV infection. Prospective studies are needed to determine if sharing HDSSs is associated with increased HIV and HCV incidence among IDUs."
438,0.005,1.0000,"The response of HIV-1 to initial zidovudine (ZDV) treatment was assessed in 11 patients with severe HIV disease. We quantified serum HIV-1 concentrations and mutations associated with ZDV resistance by culture-independent methods. There was a prompt fall in serum HIV-1 RNA within 1-2 days of treatment with maximum suppression by seven days, which was paralleled by changes in serum p24 antigen (p24 Ag). Serum RNA started to return to pretreatment levels within weeks. The HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) gene in most patients developed mutations associated with drug resistance within months and as early as 25 days on therapy in one patient. The codon changes were not sufficient to explain the early return of serum HIV-1 RNA levels and their patterns continued to evolve after patients stopped taking ZDV. The significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the limited long-term efficacy of ZDV. The dynamic time course of viral load and RT responses to ZDV is of particular importance in short-term interventions such as pregnancy."

It was an ambispective cohort study carried out in 11 HIV units in Spain and involved 711 consecutive patients positive for HIV/HCV who started interferon plus ribavirin therapy between 2000 and 2005. We measured sustained virologic response (SVR), i.e., undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks after the end of treatment, and clinical outcomes, defined as death (liver-related or non-liver-related), liver decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation. Of 711 patients who were positive for HIV/HCV, 31% had SVR. During a mean follow-up of 20.8 months (interquartile range: 12.2-38.7), the incidence rates per 100 person-years of overall mortality, liver-related mortality, and liver decompensation were 0.46, 0.23, and 0.23 among patients with SVR and 3.12, 1.65, and 4.33 among those without SVR (P = 0.003, 0.028, and <0.001 by the log-rank test), respectively. Cox regression analysis adjusted for fibrosis, HCV genotype, HCV RNA viral load, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clinical category, and nadir CD4+ cell count showed that the adjusted hazard ratio of liver-related events was 8.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.20; 66.11, P = 0.032) for nonresponders in comparison with responders and 4.96 (95% confidence interval, 2.27; 10.85, P < 0.001) for patients with fibrosis grade of F3-F4 versus those with F0-F2.Because this was not a prospective study, selection and survival biases may influence estimates of effect."

With the development of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV, chronic HCV infection has become a major cause of liver disease and mortality for hemophiliac patients coinfected with HCV/HIV. Data is limited regarding the efficacy and safety of antiviral therapy with the HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir (TVR) in combination with pegylated interferon-α (PegIFN-α) and ribavirin (RBV) for hemophilia patients coinfected with HCV/HIV. We report a case of a Japanese patient with hemophilia and HCV/HIV coinfection who had partial response to prior to PegIFN-α and RBV therapy. This is the first published report of 24-week TVR-based triple therapy for a hemophilia patient coinfected with HCV/HIV. The patient had HCV genotype 1a infection with a high viral load. His single-nucleotide polymorphism of the interleukin 28B (rs8099917) gene was the TT major allele. He presented with undetectable HIV RNA and a high CD4(+) T cell counts by taking ART including tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir. He was again treated for HCV with TVR plus PegIFN-α2b and RBV for the first 12 weeks, followed by the continuation of PegIFN-α2b and RBV for 12 additional weeks while continuing ART. He had rapid virological response and achieved sustained virological response with the 24-week treatment. No serious adverse events such as skin rash, severe anemia or exacerbated bleeding tendency were observed, only a mild headache. No dose adjustment was necessary when tenofovir and raltegravir were used in combined with TVR, and no HIV breakthrough was observed. TVR-based triple therapy with ART could can an effective treatment for hemophilia patients coinfected with HCV (genotype 1)/HIV regardless of prior response. TVR can be used in combination with tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir for patients with hemophilia. Furthermore, patients with undetectable HCV RNA at week 4 could be successfully treated with a 24-week regimen. "
1903,0.005,1.0000,"To prospectively observe the efficacy, tolerability, immune reconstitution and toxicity of long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in Chinese patients infected HIV. 437 cases originally received two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) during a mean period of 4.3 years (3.1-7.3). Patients were followed up by HIV RNA levels, T lymphocyte subsets, blood routine test, and biochemical parameters. If active opportunistic infections, apparent side effects or virological failure appeared, appropriate treatment would be taken immediately. 30 patients (6.86%) died, most in the first 6 months of HAART. The proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA <500 copies/ml was 90.8%, 63.5%, 69.4%, 70.0% and 72.2% at 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 year. The CD4+ T cell count was 115, 246, 301, 334, 363, 356,386 and 373 cells/ul at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 year. 67.9% showed various drug-related side effects, most including gastrointestinal side-effects, nervous disorder, myelotoxicity and abnormal liver function, rashes, serum cholesterol elevation, mostly appearing in the first 12 months. Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events occurred in 41 cases. This is the first to report results from the prospectively 7-year follow-up of Chinese patients infected HIV taking HAART. It demonstrates that two NRTIs and one NNRTI regimens may persistently suppress HIV viremia and continuously induce CD4 cell increase, with good safety and tolerance. The majority took first-line regimens effectively. 19.2% changed to other first-line drug due to drug-related side effects, 10.2% switched to second-line regimens due to viral resistance. Some discontinued or got virological failure because of poor compliance."
2075,0.005,1.0000,"The present study was conducted to investigate a possible correlation between plasma (PVL) and seminal viral load (SVL) on treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected patients in Vitória, ES, Brazil. We also evaluated whether the progressive immunosuppression associated with HIV disease (as evidenced by declining CD4 T cell counts) has any impact on the correlation between PVL and SVL HIV-1. Viral load on paired blood and semen samples from 56 consecutive treatment-naïve patients were evaluated and compared to CD4 cell counts. Viral load and T cell counts (cells/microl) were determined by NASBA and by flow cytometry, respectively. Overall, a strong positive correlation between PVL and SVL (rho = 0.438, p = 0.001) was observed. However, when patients were grouped according to their CD4 counts, this correlation was only significant among patients with CD4 counts > 200 cells/microl. Results presented here demonstrate the existence of a strong correlation between PVL and SVL on patients with CD4 cell counts > 200 cells/microl, suggesting that this association may correlate with disease progression."
13904,0.005,1.0000,"The effect of antiretroviral therapy on both T-cell numbers and T-cell function in peripheral blood was studied. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell numbers, T-cell reactivity to CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb), and viral RNA load date were obtained from patients treated for at least 28 weeks with either the HIV-1 protease inhibitor ritonavir, the nonnucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor nevirapine, or the nucleoside-analogue RT inhibitor zidovudine. Compared with both RT inhibitors, treatment with the protease inhibitor ritonavir resulted in the most significant and persistent elevation of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts. However, in vitro T-cell functional improvement was of limited duration in the ritonavir-treated group and was inversely correlated with viral RNA load changes during the entire follow-up period. Thus, despite what can be assumed of responses during RT inhibitor therapy, quantitative responses on therapy did not necessarily correlate with qualitative immunologic responses, as can be seen during treatment with ritonavir. For optimal immune reconstitution, both numeric and functional immunologic improvements are essential. During antiretroviral therapy, measurement of in vitro improvement in immune function will be useful as a correlate for transient drug-induced alteration of immunodeficiency."

In this study, we used a panel of major histocompatibility complex class I tetramers to examine responses to frequently targeted CD8 T-cell epitopes in a large cohort of antiretroviral-therapy-naïve HIV type 1 clade C virus-infected persons in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. In terms of effector functions of proliferation, cytokine production, and degranulation, only proliferation showed a significant correlation with viral load. This robust inverse relationship provides an important functional correlate of viral control relevant to both vaccine design and evaluation."
12468,0.005,1.0000,"Administration of interleukin 2 (IL-2) leads to selective and sustained CD4+ T-cell expansions in patients infected with HIV. It has been hypothesized that persistent CD4+ T-cell proliferation is the primary mechanism maintaining these expansions. T-cell proliferation was studied by ex vivo bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and intracellular Ki67 staining in HIV-infected patients treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) with or without IL-2. In contrast to the tested hypothesis, HIV-infected patients treated with IL-2 had lower CD4+ T-cell proliferation compared to patients treated with ART alone. Independently of viral load changes, administration of IL-2 led to a decrease in basal CD4+ T-cell proliferation. Total numbers of CD4+ T cells with naive and recall, but not effector, memory phenotype were increased. The degree of CD4+ T-cell expansion correlated with the decreases in proliferation and a strong association was seen between these decreases and the expansion of the CD4+/CD25+ subset. Intermittent IL-2 in HIV-infected patients leads to expansions of CD4+/CD25+ T cells with naive and recall memory phenotypes that strongly correlate with decreases in proliferation. These data suggest that decreased T-cell proliferation is central in the CD4+ T-cell expansions induced by IL-2."
6665,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CD8(+) T cells provide an important defense in controlling HIV-1 replication, particularly following acquisition of infection. To delineate the breadth and potency of these responses in patients upon initial presentation and before treatment, we determined the fine specificities and frequencies of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-secreting CD8(+) T cells recognizing all HIV-1 proteins in patients with primary infection. In these subjects, the earliest detected responses were directed predominantly against Nef, Tat, Vpr, and Env. Tat- and Vpr-specific CD8(+) T cells accounted for the greatest frequencies of mean IFN-gamma spot-forming cells (SFC). Nef-specific responses (10 of 21) were more commonly detected. A mean of 2.3 epitopes were recognized with various avidities per subject, and the number increased with the duration of infection (R = 0.47, P = 0.031). The mean frequency of CD8(+) T cells (985 SFC/10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells) correlated with the number of epitopes recognized (R = 0.84, P < 0.0001) and the number of HLA-restricting alleles (R = 0.79, P < 0.0001). Neither the total SFC frequencies nor the number of epitopes recognized correlated with the concurrent plasma viral load. Seventeen novel epitopes were identified, four of which were restricted to HLA alleles (A23 and B72) that are common among African descendents. Thus, primary HIV-1 infection induces strong CD8(+)-T-cell immunity whose specificities broaden over time, but their frequencies and breadth do not correlate with HIV-1 containment when examined concurrently. Many novel epitopes, particularly directed to Nef, Tat, and Env, and frequently with unique HLA restrictions, merit further consideration in vaccine design."
14057,0.005,1.0000,"This analysis involves 22 patients with diagnosed symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Neurologic symptoms were present in 11 patients, ranging from severe and persistent headache to clinical signs suggestive of meningitis. A strong correlation between neurological symptoms and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral load was found. The mean CSF HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) level was 4. 12 log for patients with neurological symptoms and 2.58 log for patients without neurological symptoms (P<.00001). Plasma viral load alone does not correlate or predict central nervous system (CNS) involvement. In our sample of patients, HIV RNA levels could be detected in most patients regardless of the presence of neurological symptoms. Moreover, early treatment including drugs with high levels of penetration in the CNS must be considered for patients with primary HIV infection."
12156,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between peripheral blood CD4+ T cell subsets and routine viro-immunological markers in vertically HIV-1-infected children undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets were examined by three-colour flow cytometry. Plasma viraemia was quantified by a standardized molecular assay. A negative correlation between the %CD4+ T cells and both viral load and the %CD8+ T cells was observed. A strong positive correlation between the %CD4 T cells and naïve, CD38+ and non-activated CD4+ T cell subsets was found, whereas the %CD4 T cells correlated negatively with the numbers of memory, activated and memory-activated CD4+ T cell subsets. Elevated percentages of CD8 T cells were associated with increased memory and CD4+ CD62L-T cell subsets, whereas the naïve and CD4+ HLA-DRCD38+ subsets negatively correlated with the CD8%. Co-expression of CD62L on memory CD4+ cells and high expression of HLA-DR (but not of CD38) were associated with high viral load. No association between viral load and naïve CD4+ T cells was observed. Specific CD4+ T cell subsets may be more informative than routine surrogate markers in defining the evolution of HIV infection and immune reconstitution in children."
3806,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to determine the tissue distribution and antiviral activity of the CD8 lymphocytes that suppress the replication of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Cell-associated FIV load, CD8alpha(+)beta(low) cells, and CD8 cell-mediated suppression of FIV were measured serially in the blood, thymus, and peripheral lymph nodes after neonatal inoculation. Between 6 and 10 weeks, relative numbers of CD8alpha(+)beta(low) cells increased, whereas CD8alpha(+)beta(high) cells declined in the thymus and blood of infected cats. By 12-16 weeks, the lymph nodes were enlarged because of an absolute expansion of all CD8beta subpopulations. The strength of CD8 cell-mediated FIV suppression in vitro, but not CD8alpha(+)beta(low) cell content, was correlated inversely with virus load in the thymus and blood. Thus, after neonatal FIV inoculation, CD8alpha(+)beta(low) cells first occupy the thymus and blood, where strong CD8 cell-mediated antiviral activity is linked to reduced virus load in multiple lymphoid tissues."
10999,0.005,1.0000,"While human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 chemokine co-receptors 5 tropism and the GWGR motif in the envelope third variable region (V3 loop) have been associated with a slower disease progression, their influence on antiretroviral response remains unclear. The impact of baseline V3 characteristics on treatment response was evaluated in a randomised, double blind, prospective cohort study with patients initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy with lopinavir or efavirenz plus azithothymidine/3TC (1:1) over 48 weeks. Similar virological and immunological responses were observed for both treatment regimens. The 43 individuals had a mean baseline CD4 T cell count of 119 cells/mm(3) [standard deviation (SD) = 99] and a mean viral load of 5.09 log(10) copies/mL (SD = 0.49). The GWGR motif was not associated with a CD4 T cell response, but predicted R5 tropism by the geno2pheno([clinical20%]) algorithm correlated with higher CD4 T cell levels at all monitoring points (p < 0.05). Moreover, higher false-positive rates (FPR) values from this analysis revealed a strong correlation with CD4 T cell recovery (p < 0.0001). Transmitted drug resistance mutations, documented in 3/41 (7.3%) cases, were unrelated to the assigned antiretroviral regimen and had no impact on patient outcomes. In conclusion, naÏve HIV-1 R5 infected patients exhibited higher CD4 T cell counts at baseline; this difference was sustained throughout therapy. The geno2pheno([clinical]) option FPR positively correlated with CD4 T cell gain and may be useful in predicting CD4 T cell recovery."
3435,0.005,1.0000,"The types of neuromuscular diseases associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are described. Our classification includes: (1) six subtypes of peripheral neuropathies--namely, acute Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, an axonal, predominantly sensory, painful polyneuropathy, a sensory ataxic neuropathy due to ganglioneuronitis, and an inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy presenting as cauda equina syndrome; (2) inflammatory myopathies (e.g., polymyositis); and (3) other less common neuromuscular manifestations, such as type II muscle fiber atrophy and nemaline myopathy. Although the exact incidence of clinical and subclinical neuromuscular diseases in HIV-positive and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients is unknown, estimates vary from 15 to almost 50% of such individuals. The type of neuropathy or myopathy related to the specific stage of HIV infection, the pathogenetic mechanisms involved, and effective therapies are discussed. A neuromuscular disease not only occurs in patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex, but it can coincide with HIV seroconversion or it can be the only clinical indication of a chronic silent HIV infection. Chronic asymptomatic HIV infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of certain acquired inflammatory polyneuropathies or myopathies. Precautions needed when doing electromyographic studies are discussed."

These three pathologic conditions are associated with an increased prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this multidisciplinary clinical review, we aim to discuss the ever-expanding wealth of clinical and epidemiological evidence supporting a key role of fatty liver in the development of T2D and CVD in patients with NAFLD and in those with HCV or HIV infections. For each of these three common diseases, the epidemiological features, pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical implications of the presence of fatty liver in predicting the risk of incident T2D and CVD are examined in depth. Collectively, the data discussed in this updated review, which follows an innovative comparative approach, further reinforce the conclusion that the presence of fatty/inflamed/fibrotic liver might be a shared important determinant for the development of T2D and CVD in patients with NAFLD, HCV or HIV. This review may also open new avenues in the clinical and research arenas and paves the way for the planning of future, well-designed prospective and intervention studies."
2686,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B associated antigen (HB-Ag) may be observed in the serum in subjects either apparently healthy or exhibiting a number of disease symptoms. Its incidence among the Geneva voluntary blood donors is 0.48% with 54% exhibiting the surface antigen ad and 34% ay. While the HB-Ag positive blood donors appeared clinically healthy, minor pathology was found in the majority of them (thrombocytopenia, histological evidence of inflammatory foci, of persistent hepatitis and of chronic aggressive hepatitis). In 82 patients suffering from hepatitis B the same ad-ay type distribution of the HB-Ag has been found. In 11 out of 31 patients increased Clq binding suggests the presence of circulating complexes. Diminutions in the level of complement components also indicates participation of complement in the formation of immunocomplexes. In 2 out of 3 patients with Hb-Ag positive polyarteritis nodosa, the Clq binding test was also positive. The pathophysiologic implications of hepatitis B infection are discussed in connection with the authors and other findings. It appears that the main defense mechanism leading to elimination of the viruses within the hepatocytes lies in cell mediated immunity. Hepatitis would then represent the side reaction of this defense mechanism. Antibodies are probably useful in preventing the virus from entering the cell, but also in the course of the cell mediated defense mechanism (elimination of viral material liberated during the T-cell hepatocellular interaction). Immune complexes may be operative in certain extrahepatic manifestations such as arthralgia. Polyarteritis nodosa may result from local antibody interaction with antigen fixed within arterial walls."
9247,0.005,1.0000,"It remains crucial to develop a laboratory model for studying hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronic infection. We hereby produced a recombinant covalently closed circular DNA (rcccDNA) in view of the key role of cccDNA in HBV persistence. A loxP-chimeric intron was engineered into a monomeric HBV genome in a precursor plasmid (prcccDNA), which was excised using Cre/loxP-mediated DNA recombination into a 3.3-kb rcccDNA in the nuclei of hepatocytes. The chimeric intron was spliced from RNA transcripts without interrupting the HBV life cycle. In cultured hepatoma cells, cotransfection of prcccDNA and pCMV-Cre (encoding Cre recombinase) resulted in accumulation of nuclear rcccDNA that was heat stable and epigenetically organized as a minichromosome. A mouse model of HBV infection was developed by hydrodynamic injection of prcccDNA. In the presence of Cre recombinase, rcccDNA was induced in the mouse liver with effective viral replication and expression, triggering a compromised T-cell response against HBV. Significant T-cell hyporesponsiveness occurred in mice receiving 4 μg prcccDNA, resulting in prolonged HBV antigenemia for up to 9 weeks. Persistent liver injury was observed as elevated alanine transaminase activity in serum and sustained inflammatory infiltration in the liver. Although a T-cell dysfunction was induced similarly, mice injected with a plasmid containing a linear HBV replicon showed rapid viral clearance within 2 weeks. Collectively, our study provides an innovative approach for producing a cccDNA surrogate that established HBV persistence in immunocompetent mice. It also represents a useful model system in vitro and in vivo for evaluating antiviral treatments against HBV cccDNA. Importance: (i) Unlike plasmids that contain a linear HBV replicon, rcccDNA established HBV persistence with sustained liver injury in immunocompetent mice. This method could be a prototype for developing a mouse model of chronic HBV infection. (ii) An exogenous intron was engineered into the HBV genome for functionally seamless DNA recombination. This original approach could be also extended to other viral studies. (iii) rcccDNA was substantially induced in the nuclei of hepatocytes and could be easily distinguished by its exogenous intron using PCR. This convenient model system affords the opportunity to test antivirals directly targeting HBV cccDNA."

The mRNA expressions of all the 4 cytokines in HIV-1 infected individuals were significantly higher compared to healthy controls (P value range 0.0004-0.01). The mean level of IL-10, INF-gamma and TNF-α were higher in HIV infected individuals with low CD4 counts (<300 cells/μl). The IL-10 expression showed a significant negative correlation with CD4 counts (r=-0.25, P=0.04) while IL-21 showed a positive correlation with CD4 counts (r=0.26, P=0.03). There was a significant negative correlation between the cytomegalovirus (CMV) viral load and IL-21 expression. Cytokine levels by mRNA detection avoids the inherent problem of measuring plasma level and this study also provide information on the cytokine levels and CD4+ T cell level among HIV-1 subtype C infected individuals with opportunistic viral infections like CMV."
19443,0.005,1.0000,"We studied whether the serum levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor(sTNFR) type I or II correlate with clinical progression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1) infection. Serum levels of sTNFR type I and II were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in sixty five patients with HIV-1 infected hemophiliacs and 10 healthy controls. In a longitudinal study, we assessed whether the decline of CD4+ lymphocyte counts were associated with increased serum concentrations of sTNFRs. Elevated serum concentrations of sTNFRs were found among the HIV-1 infected patients and higher in patients with advanced clinical stage. We noticed there were two distinct patient groups in change of CD4+ lymphocyte count when twenty-eight patients were followed retrospectively for a median period of 65 months. 14 patients represented stable CD4+ lymphocyte counts, but another 14 patients had more than 40% decrease of CD4+ lymphocyte counts over the course of this study. Serum sTNFR type II levels were 3.49 +/- 0.71 to 3.11 +/- 0.31 ng/ml in the former group, and 4.88 +/- 0.91 to 4.26 +/- 0.71 ng/ml in the latter group during the study. Significantly higher levels of sTNFR type II were already revealed at early time in the latter group. There was, however, no significant difference in the level of sTNFR type I between the two. These results suggest that serum levels of sTNFR type II provided useful information as a predictor of disease progression related to the decline of CD4+ lymphocyte counts."
16702,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B is the main risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Asia. The most important preventive strategy's adoption of the universal hepatitis B vaccination program is now in its third decade. There is a clear reduction in both chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (hepatitis B surface antigen ""carriage"") but also in childhood HCC in Taiwan. An outstanding concern is variability in vaccine coverage between countries. For patients with chronic hepatitis B, serum HBV DNA levels have emerged as the key risk factor for development of HCC. The initial treatment for chronic hepatitis B was interferon. One randomized control trial, and several case-control or cohort studies have shown benefits for preventing HCC, particularly in cirrhotic patients who responded to therapy. With nucleos(t)ide analogs, the most important study has been the Asian Cirrhosis Lamivudine multicenter randomized controlled trial. This showed that lamivudine can reduce disease progression in HBV-related cirrhosis, including an approximately 50% decrease in HCC incidence. Such efficacy was achieved despite emergence of drug resistance in approximately 50% of cases. Case-control studies have suggested that hepatitis B cases without cirrhosis may also benefit. In conclusion, it is now possible to prevent HBV-related HCC. The most effective method is hepatitis B vaccination, which prevents chronic HBV infection and chronic liver disease resulting therefrom. Interferon therapy appears to confer benefit but the evidence is weaker. First-generation oral antiviral (lamivudine) reduces HCC risk, particularly in cirrhotics. Long-term outcome data with newer, more potent HBV antivirals that have a higher genetic barrier to drug resistance are eagerly awaited."
4063,0.005,1.0000,"Biochemical growth hormone deficiency is prevalent among human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, but if this condition is clinically relevant remains challenging. The aim is to prospectively compare the growth hormone deficiency/insulin-like growth factor-1 status of 71 human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with impaired growth hormone response to growth hormone releasing hormone + Arginine with that of 65 hypopituitary patients affected by a true growth hormone deficiency secondary to pituitary disease. The main outcomes were: basal serum growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, growth hormone peak and area under the curve after growth hormone response to growth hormone releasing hormone + Arginine test, body mass index, waist and hip circumference, and body composition by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Insulin-like growth factor-1 binding protein 3, basal growth hormone (p < 0.005), growth hormone peak and area under the curve after growth hormone response to growth hormone releasing hormone + Arginine, waist to hip ratio, insulin-like growth factor-1, fasting glucose, insulin, and triglycerides (p < 0.0001) were lower in hypopituitary than human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Total and trunk fat mass by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry were higher in hypopituitary than in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients (p < 0.0001). In all the patients total body fat was associated with both growth hormone peak and area under the curve at stepwise linear regression analysis. The degree of growth hormone deficiency is more severe in hypopituitary than in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, suggesting that the function of growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis is partially rescued in the latter thanks to a preserved pituitary secretory reserve. Data from the current study suggest that human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with peak growth hormone < 9 mg/L may have partial growth hormone deficiency and clinicians should be cautious before prescribing recombinant human growth hormone replacement treatment to patients living with human immunodeficiency virus."

A subgroup of 26 untreated patients was followed during longitudinal testing, while the effects of antiretroviral therapy were evaluated in 34 patients (nucleoside analogs in 9, nucleoside analogs in combination with protease inhibitors in 25). Twenty healthy sex- and age-matched controls were analyzed for comparison. IGF-II was decreased (P = 0.03) and IGF-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) and IGFBP-3 protease activity were increased (P < 0.001) in AIDS patients compared with other HIV-infected individuals and controls. Plasma levels of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 protease activity correlated positively to virus load (P < 0.001) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P < 0.025) and negatively to CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell counts (P < 0.001). AIDS patients with wasting (n = 13) had lower IGF-II levels (P = 0.001) and higher IGFBP-2 levels (P = 0.001) than other AIDS patients. Although no significant change in any of the IGF-parameters was observed in patients during antiretroviral therapy, patients with elevated IGFBP-3 protease activity before therapy (5 of 34) all had a decrease during treatment. During longitudinal testing in patients followed without antiretroviral therapy, disease progression was associated with increases in IGFBP-3 protease activity and IGFBP-2 levels. Our results reveal several alterations in the IGF system during HIV infection with decreased IGF-II levels, increased concentration of IGFBP-2, and an increased IGFBP-3 protease activity in advanced disease."

The selection of a potent nucleos(t)ide analogue with a high barrier to resistance as a first-line therapy, such as entecavir or tenofovir, provides the best chance of achieving long-term treatment goals and should be used wherever possible. The barrier to resistance of a given nucleos(t)ide analogue is influenced by genetic barrier, drug potency, patient adherence, pharmacological barrier, viral fitness, mechanism of action, and cross-resistance. In countries with limited health-care resources, the selection of a therapy with a high barrier to resistance is not always possible and alternative strategies for preventing resistance might be needed, although limited data are available to support these strategies."

Key Messages: In patients with advanced liver fibrosis or liver cirrhosis, antiviral therapy is mandatory to slow down, halt or reverse disease progression and possibly reduce the risk of HCC development. As in patients without advanced fibrosis, PEG-interferon and nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NUCs) are available for antiviral therapy. NUC therapy should be performed indefinitely as the rates of HBs-Ag loss are low. Entecavir or tenofovir should be preferred due to their strong antiviral potency and their high barrier to resistance. PEG-interferon therapy can be administered to patients with compensated liver disease but should not be offered to patients with signs of hepatic decompensation."

Between March and June 2010, 139 adult HIV patients taking regular ART for at least a month received weekly reminders to support adherence. These reminders consisted of a weekly interactive call and a non-interactive neutral pictorial short message service (SMS). After four weeks of the intervention, participants were interviewed to study perceptions on preference, usefulness, potential stigma and privacy concerns associated with this intervention. Majority of the participants were urban (89%), and had at least a secondary education (85%). A total of 744 calls were made, 545 (76%) of which were received by the participants. In addition, all participants received the weekly pictorial SMS reminder. A month later, 90% of participants reported the intervention as being helpful as medication reminders, and did not feel their privacy was intruded. Participants (87%) reported that they preferred the call as reminders, just 11% favoured SMS reminders alone. Only 59% of participants viewed all the SMSs that were delivered, while 15% never viewed any at all. Participants also denied any discomfort or stigma despite 20% and 13%, respectively, reporting that another person had inadvertently received their reminder call or SMS. Mobile phone interventions are an acceptable way of supporting adherence in this setting. Voice calls rather than SMSs alone seem to be preferred as reminders. Further research to study the influence of this intervention on adherence and health maintenance is warranted."

898,0.005,1.0000,"Youth living with HIV/AIDS (YLH) face unique challenges to optimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Accurate, real-time methods to assess adherence are needed to facilitate early intervention and promote viral suppression. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and validity of interactive text message response (ITR) as a measure of adherence to ART among YLH. This study was part of a larger pilot text message reminder intervention conducted at a US community-based, LGBT-focused health center providing clinical services to YLH. Eligibility criteria for this pilot study included HIV-positive serostatus, aged 14-29, use of personal cell phone, English-speaking, and on ART with demonstrated adherence difficulties. During the 24-week study period, participants received personalized daily short message system reminders with a follow-up message 1 hour later asking whether they took medication and directing a response via return text message. To determine whether or not ITR would be a feasible, valid measure of adherence, we calculated the proportion of positive responses indicating medication had been taken divided by the total number of messages requesting a response and compared this response rate to a self-reported adherence measure, the visual analogue scale (VAS). Participants (n = 25) were on average 23 years old, largely male (92%), Black (60%) and behaviorally infected (84%). Over the course of the intervention, study participants responded to prompts via text to indicate whether or not they had taken their medication approximately 61% of the time. The overall mean ITR adherence rate (i.e., positive responses) was 57.4% (SD = 28.5%). ITR and VAS measures were moderately, positively correlated (r = 0.52, p < 0.05) during the first 6 weeks of the study period. ITR adherence rates were significantly higher on weekdays versus weekends (p < 0.05). This pilot study showed both moderate responsiveness of individuals to daily ITR and a moderate correlation of ITR adherence rates with a reliable measure during the first 6 weeks of the study, suggesting that this method, with additional effort and improvements, may be a helpful tool to identify and respond to adherence patterns in real-time."
8312,0.005,1.0000,"This paper describes a preliminary study aimed at testing the efficacy of a brief medication counselling and behavioural intervention in improving adherence to combination antiretroviral medication therapy and prophylactic treatment among non-adherent men living with HIV. Twenty-one non-adherent HIV-positive men obtaining primary care clinical services at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center were recruited by health care providers. Intervention participants were primarily African-Americans with histories of intravenous drug use. During a period of five months, participants were provided with monthly medication counselling and a weekly medication pill organizer. Participants were compared with 21 non-adherent matched controls receiving standard pharmacy care including review of medications. Intervention and control subjects were compared on several variables: medication refill timeliness, appointment attendance, hospitalizations and opportunistic infections. Medical information was obtained from hospital and pharmacy records at baseline and post-intervention. Pre- to post-intervention rates of adherence to medication refills and clinic appointments increased significantly among intervention participants. Relative to matched controls, intervention participants also significantly increased drop-in visits and showed fewer hospitalizations. Intervention participants also showed significant decreases in the number of opportunistic infections. Results suggest that exposure to medication counselling and behavioural interventions increase adherence, with associated reductions in negative clinical outcomes."
2700,0.005,1.0000,"The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to treat chronic illnesses, especially HIV, is becoming increasingly widespread. Given this popularity, it is critical to understand how HIV-positive individuals use CAM and, more specifically, whether CAM use impacts their adherence to prescribed antiretroviral regimens (HAART). The present study examined the relationship between CAM use and HAART adherence among HIV+ women. Data were analysed from 366 HIV-positive, mostly African-American women, aged 18-50 years in Alabama and Georgia who were enrolled in an intervention to reduce high-risk sexual behaviour. At enrollment data were collected describing use of CAM and HAART use. Women were classified as CAM users if they reported taking herbal/natural immunity boosters (Chinese herbs, mushrooms, garlic, ginseng or algae) or multivitamins, or reported using religious/psychic health or bodywork to treat HIV. Women were classified as non-adherent if they reported missing any doses of their HAART medication in the 30 days preceding baseline assessment. Logistic regressions models, adjusted for potential confounders, were used to investigate the relationship between CAM use and HAART adherence. Women using CAM (immunity boosters or vitamins), relative to non-CAM users, were 1.69 times more likely to report missing HAART doses in the last 30 days (CI: 1.02-2.80; P=.041) even after adjusting for age, education, race, religion and income. The findings provide preliminary evidence that patients using CAM may be doing so as an alternative to traditional medicine as opposed to complementing prescribed HARRT treatment regimens. The inconsistent use of HAART is problematic given its association with drug resistance. Therefore, health care providers and patients should have explicit dialogues about how to effectively integrate CAM practices into traditional treatment regimens so that the safety and health of HIV-positive patients is not compromised."
12851,0.005,1.0000,"Healthy Choices, a four-session motivational interviewing-based intervention, reduces risk behaviors among US youth living with HIV (YLWH). We randomized 110 Thai YLWH (16-25 years) to receive either Healthy Choices or time-matched health education (Control) over 12 weeks. Risk behaviors were assessed at baseline, 1, and 6 months post-session. The pilot study was not powered for between-group differences; there were no statistical differences in sexual risks, alcohol use, and antiretroviral adherence between the two groups at any visit. In within-group analyses, Healthy Choices group demonstrated decreases in the proportion of HIV-negative partners (20 vs 8.2%, P = 0.03) and HIV sexual risk scores (4.3 vs 3.3, P = 0.04), and increased trends in the proportion of protected sex (57 vs 76.3%, P = 0.07) from baseline to 1 month post-session. These changes were not sustained 6 months later. No changes were observed in Control group. Healthy Choices has potential to improve sexual risks among Thai YLWH."
5584,0.005,1.0000,"We assessed the barriers and facilitators to highly active antiretroviral therapy adherence and determined their prevalence among HIV/AIDS patients in Hyderabad, India. We conducted a cross-sectional study among HIV-infected adults prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy and receiving care from nine clinics. Depression was screened using Patient Health Questionnaire 9 and facilitators of HIV medication adherence were assessed using an 11-item scale which yielded a total positive attitude to disease score. Prevalence ratios of non-adherence between different categories of potential risk factors were calculated. We compared mean 'facilitators to adherence' scores between the adherent and non-adherent population. Multivariable Poisson regression with robust variance was used to identify independent risk factors. Among the 211 respondents, nearly 20% were non-adherent, approximately 8% had either moderately severe or severe depression and mean score for combined facilitators to medication adherence was 33.35 (±7.88) out of a possible 44 points. Factors significantly associated with non-adherence included older age, female sex worker, moderate-to-severe depression and the combined facilitators to medication adherence score. These data from a broad range of clinical settings in Hyderabad reveal that key groups to focus on for adherence intervention are female sex workers, older persons and those with depression."
13439,0.005,1.0000,"The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has transformed this disease from a fatal infection to a chronic yet manageable condition by restoring immune function. All the same, this restoration of immune response in some may be associated with deterioration in clinical status, which has been termed immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). This syndrome often occurs in the context of an underlying opportunistic infection and develops after an interval of weeks to months after the initiation of HAART. Occasionally, IRIS may occur in the brain without any opportunistic infection, which presents as a T cell-mediated encephalitis. This paradoxical infiltration of previously immune suppressed patients with T cells represents a diagnostic challenge and a treatment dilemma. Nonetheless, CNS-IRIS with or without an opportunistic infection can range in severity. Severe cases can be fatal and hence require intervention with steroid treatment. This review discusses the diagnosis, clinical manifestations, risk factors, pathophysiology, and potential treatment strategies of the various forms of IRIS that involve the nervous system."
4295,0.005,1.0000,"This study examined psychological functioning and beliefs about medicine in adolescents with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on highly active antiretroviral therapy in a community-based directly observed therapy (DOT) pilot feasibility study. Participants were youth with behaviorally acquired HIV (n = 20; 65% female; median age, 21 years) with adherence problems, who received once-daily DOT. Youth were assessed at baseline, week 12 (post-DOT), and week 24 (follow-up). At baseline, 55% of youth reported having clinical depressive symptoms compared to 27% at week 12 with sustained improvements at week 24. At baseline, substance use was reported within the borderline clinical range (T(score) = 68), with clinical but statistically nonsignificant improvement (T(score) = 61) at week 12. Hopelessness scores reflected optimism for the future. Coping strategies showed significantly decreased cognitive avoidance (p = .02), emotional discharge (p = .004), and acceptance/resignation (""nothing I can do,"" p = .004), whereas positive reappraisal and seeking support emerged. With the exception of depressive symptoms, week 12 improvements were not sustained at week 24. DOT adherence was predicted by higher baseline depression (p = .05), beliefs about medicine (p = .006) and perceived threat of illness scores (p = .03). Youth with behaviorally acquired HIV and adherence problems who participated in a community-based DOT intervention reported clinically improved depressive symptoms, and temporarily reduced substance use and negative coping strategies. Depressive symptoms, beliefs about medicine, and viewing HIV as a potential threat predicted better DOT adherence."
19083,0.005,1.0000,"The overall HIV-1 membrane lipid contents resemble lipid rafts, and we have previously demonstrated that raft-promoting properties of virus-associated cholesterol (with modifications in either the 3β-OH group or AB rings) are important for HIV-1 infectivity. As cholesterol is present in both rafts and non-rafts domains of HIV-1 membrane, we question whether the interpretation of rafts property of virus-associated cholesterol being an absolute requirement for HIV-1 function is too simplistic. The carbon side chain of cholesterol is the third component of cholesterol that can affect the fluidity of membrane depending on its context within the lipid membrane bilayers. In this work, we have used synthetic cholesterol analogues that have different lengths of carbon side chain for our investigation. In contrast to our previous report, we have found that cholesterol side chain analogues that lack in vitro defined raft promoting-property is able to support HIV-1 replication. More specifically, cholesterol analogues with side chains of intermediate length have greater capacity to support HIV-1 infection, suggesting HIV-1 is able to maintain function using cholesterol variants that promote a range of non-rafts- to rafts-properties. Our data demonstrate cholesterol properties other than raft-promoting function also contribute to the infectivity of HIV-1. "
6876,0.005,1.0000,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection in the cat is a well-evaluated model of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection in man with both viruses associated with significant neuropathology. Although studies in both HIV and FIV infections have shown that virus enters the brain in the acute stages of disease, little is known of the mechanisms of viral entry. The dissection of this stage is fundamental to the development of therapies that may prevent or modulate central nervous system (CNS) infection. The present study was designed to characterize the early sequential neuropathological changes following infection with FIV(GL8), a strain known to enter the CNS in acute infection. Cats were infected either by the intraperitoneal (n = 13) or intravenous (n = 12) route with 2000 cat infectious units of virus. Histopathological assessments following intraperitoneal infections were at 4 (n = 2), 5 (n = 1), 8 (n = 3), 10 (n = 1), 16 (n = 1), 32 (n = 2), 52 (n = 2), and 104 (n = 1) weeks post infection whereas animals infected intravenously were examined (n = 3) at 1, 4, 10, and 23 weeks post infection. The most significant lesions following both routes of infection were lymphocyte-rich perivascular infiltrates within cerebral and cerebellar meninges, in choroid plexus and spinal cord dura mater and within epineurium of the sciatic nerve. In addition, following intravenous infection perivascular infiltrations were noted in parenchymal blood vessels primarily of cerebral white matter. Infiltrates were composed of CD79+ B cells and CD3+ T cells. The latter population contained a mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. The severity of lesions increased in intensity in the 8-to 16-week period following infection and then began to wane. The evaluation of this large group of cats at multiple time points revealed pathology comparable with that of early stage HIV-1-associated encephalitis. Moreover, in contrast to previous FIV neuropathology studies, transient meningeal, choroid plexus, and parenchymal vascular pathology were consistent significant findings suggesting that, as in HIV-1 infection, blood-brain barrier and choroid plexus brain barrier integrity are both compromised in early infection."
15404,0.005,1.0000,"Hemodialysis shows a high risk for hepatitis B infection, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination has now become a routine procedure. Unfortunately, 40% to 50% of hemodialysis patients do not have adequate protective antibodies against the HBV vaccination which is thought to be due to depressed cell mediated immunity. Levamisole has been reported to stimulate depressed T-cell activity and enhance B lymphocyte function and restore delayed hypersensitivity reactions in immune-depressed patients. We studied the effects of levamisole, an immunomodulatory agent, on the protective antibody response of hemodialysis patients to the HBV vaccination. Our hemodialysis patients with negative anti-HBs antibody routinely received 40 microg doses of recombinant HBV vaccine intramuscularly at 0, 1, and 6 months, and we followed serum anti-HBs levels. Patients with a serum antibody level of >10 mIU/ml were considered as responders. Study groups were classified as follows. Group 1 was comprised of 96 chronic hemodialysis patients with negative anti-HBs and HBV core antibody (52 male, 44 female, mean age of 45 +/- 15 years and mean hemodialysis duration of 46 +/- 40 months) who received HBV vaccination; 55 patients (57%) were found to be responders. Group 2 was comprised of 19 randomly selected patients who had never received hepatitis B vaccine (13 male, 6 female, mean age of 42 +/- 14 years, mean duration of hemodialysis 31 +/- 27 months) and who were started on an HBV vaccination protocol with levamisole per os 80 mg after each hemodialysis session for 4 months and followed up on serum anti-HBs levels. Seventeen of the patients completed this levamisole treatment. Fourteen of the 17 patients had the levels of the protective serum antibody indicating a higher response rate when compared with patients who did not receive levamisole (82% versus 57%, respectively, p < 0.05). Group 3 was comprised of 19 patients randomly selected from persons who did not respond to previous vaccination programs (10 male, 9 female, mean age of 51 +/- 14 years, mean duration of hemodialysis 41 +/- 31 months). A second HBV vaccination program was started with the same levamisole protocol. In this group, 18 patients completed this treatment model. Fourteen of them responded to the vaccination model. In Group 4, a second HBV vaccination program was applied without levamisole to 20 randomly selected persons who did not respond to the previous routine vaccination program (12 male, 8 female, mean age of 53 +/- 17 years, mean duration of dialysis 51 +/- 38 months). Only 3 of them responded to a second vaccination program. Comparing Group 3 with Group 4, there was a higher responder rate to HBV vaccination (77% versus 15%, respectively, p < 0.0001). These results show that levamisole treatment increases the response rate to the first HBV vaccination and of the previously unresponsive cases by modulating possible cellular immune response."
11660,0.005,1.0000,"In view of the limited efficacy of lamivudine monotherapy for chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection, combination with other drugs seems logical. Intravenous neutralization of circulating HBsAg by specific hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) has been shown to protect hepatocytes against (re-)infection with HBV in the setting of liver transplantation and postexposure prophylaxis. Large controlled vaccination trials have revealed that HBV can be prevented by HBIg therapy in the majority of newborns after perinatal infection. A benefit of anti-HBs in HBV patients has so far only been investigated in three small studies. In this pilot study we investigated the effects of polyclonal i.v. HBIg (HepatectR, Biotest) administration in HBV-infected patients. Six liver biopsy-proven HBV-infected patients, all on lamivudine treatment and HBV DNA negative by PCR, were investigated. Pre-treatment HBsAg levels varied between 120 and 9760 ng/mL. On day 1, 10.000 IU HBIg was given, followed by 10.000 IU once, twice or three times on day 29. Long-term follow-up lasted at least 4 months. HBsAg and anti-HBs were measured quantitatively by standard MEIA and also by an experimental EIA. In vitro neutralization of HBsAg by Hepatect was mimicked in an 'inhibition in solution assay'. Complete neutralization of HBsAg by HBIg in vitro was possible, 50% inhibition concentrations varied between 100 and 250 IU/L HBIg with HBsAg levels of 68 and 120 ng/mL. No HBIg-related side-effects were observed. In two patients with low pretreatment HBsAg levels HBsAg reached levels below the detection limit of the assay, which persisted a maximum of 31 and 7.5 h, respectively. Peak anti-HBs concentrations were 5100 and 4648 IU/L. In the other four patients, with higher pretreatment HBsAg levels, HBsAg concentrations in serum hardly changed. For the whole population, the drop in HBsAg did not reach statistical significance. However, in four of the six patients a further decrease in HBsAg [18%-66%] was observed. In conclusion, HBIg was well tolerated; however, efficacy was limited due to high HBsAg levels in spite of maximum inhibition of virion production. 'Neutralization' was achieved only in two patients with low HBsAg levels. Passive immunization in HBV-DNA negative patients is not a feasible option. This strategy seems only feasible if agents inhibiting both the production of viral proteins and Dane particles more selectively, become available."
147,0.005,1.0000,"Results of in vitro assays identified residues in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase (IN) important for IN-IN and IN-DNA interactions, but the potential roles of these residues in virus replication were mostly unknown. Sixteen CTD residues were targeted here, generating 24 mutant viruses. Replication-defective mutants were typed as class I (blocked at integration) or class II (additional reverse transcription and/or assembly defects). Most defective viruses (15 of 17) displayed reverse transcription defects. In contrast, replication-defective HIV-1(E246K) synthesized near-normal cDNA levels but processing of Pr55(gag) was largely inhibited in virus-producing cells. Because single-round HIV-1(E246K.Luc(R-)) transduced cells at approximately 8% of the wild-type level, we concluded that the late-stage processing defect contributed significantly to the overall replication defect of HIV-1(E246K). Results of complementation assays revealed that the CTD could function in trans to the catalytic core domain (CCD) in in vitro assays, and we since determined that certain class I and class II mutants defined a novel genetic complementation group that functioned in cells independently of IN domain boundaries. Seven of eight novel Vpr-IN mutant proteins efficiently trans-complemented class I active-site mutant virus, demonstrating catalytically active CTD mutant proteins during infection. Because most of these mutants inefficiently complemented a class II CCD mutant virus, the majority of CTD mutants were likely more defective for interactions with cellular and/or viral components that affected reverse transcription and/or preintegration trafficking than the catalytic activity of the IN enzyme."
8400,0.005,1.0000,"Induction of broadly neutralizing antibody is considered important for an effective HIV-1 vaccine. Identification and characterization of broadly neutralizing antibodies in HIV-1-infected patients will facilitate our understanding of the immune correlates to protection and the design of an effective prophylactic vaccine. A number of studies to probe the specificity of antibodies in broadly neutralizing sera in the United States and Europe have been reported. However, little is known about and would be interesting to investigate the immunological characteristics of HIV-1-positive sera in China where non-clade B viruses are prevalent and the circulating viral subtypes are distinct and more complex than both the United States and Europe. Here, we screened 80 Chinese HIV-1-positive sera against a minipanel of pseudoviruses representing various circulating HIV-1 subtypes in China and identified 8 cross-clade neutralizing sera (CNsera). Immunological characterization of the sera showed that gp120-targeting antibodies with multiple epitope specificities contributed to the cross-clade neutralizing activity of these CNsera. V3-directed antibodies were prevalent in these CNsera, but did not mainly contribute to their neutralization breath and potency while CD4bs-specific, 2F5- and 4E10-like antibodies were rarely detected. 2G12-like neutralizing antibodies were more frequently detected in HIV-1 patients from China where recombinant subtype viruses are prevalent than in United States and Europe. One broadly neutralizing serum (Serum 45) was identified to contain antibodies with unknown epitope specificities that were sensitive to terminal glycan modifications on virus Env and insensitive to N160K mutagenesis, and correlated with the cross-clade neutralization activity of Serum 45.

1433,0.005,1.0000,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) have recently accounted for an alarmingly increasing proportion of HIV-1 transmission in China. In order to investigate the immune status as a result of CRF01_AE infection and CXCR4 co-receptor usage in a young Shanghai-based HIV-1-infected MSM population in Shanghai, 364 HIV-1-infected MSM with average age of 22.7 years old, newly diagnosed between Jan 2009 and Jul 2013 were analyzed for CD4+T cell count, subtyping using phylogenetic analysis, and viral co-receptor tropism using Geno2pheno and webPSSM in combination. A total of 276 individuals were identified as recently infected. Subtype assignment were as follows: 176 (63.8%) CRF01_AE, 77 (27.9%) CRF07_BC, and 23 (8.3%) subtype B. Besides, 24 second-generation recombinant strains were identified. A lower CD4+T cell count at baseline survey was observed among CRF01_AE strain-infected individuals, compared to those who were infected with CRF07_BC (P<0.01). The frequency of baseline CD4+T cell count <200 was higher and the frequency of CD4 T counts >500 lower in CRF01_AE infection than CRF07_BC infection. It is worth noting that 32.4%-40.9% of CRF01_AE strain-infected individuals were predicted to carry CXCR4-tropic viruses whereas none of CRF07_BC and subtype B were found to be as CXCR4-tropic viruses (P<0.001). As could be expected CXCR4 tropism was associated with lower CD4 T counts. This study revealed that CRF01_AE strains with high frequency of CXCR4 tropism are prevailing in the young MSM population in China and could potentially cause a severe loss of CD4+T cell count and rapid disease progression. A regular surveillance of HIV-1 subtypes, CD4+T cell count and viral co-receptor usage would be greatly beneficial for effectively monitoring disease progression, improvement of antiretroviral therapy strategy and prompt intervention of transmission.

14047,0.005,1.0000,"Several randomised controlled trials have been undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of alpha-interferon in the therapy of chronic hepatitis B. In patients with HBe antigen-positive disease acquired in adult life the response rates vary from 25-50%. In those infected at birth, response rates are lower. Twenty-one pretreatment variables were assessed for their significance in response prediction using data from 114 patients given alpha-interferon for chronic hepatitis B virus infection. In those patients who had received a minimum of 90 million units per m2 total dose over 12 weeks, a negative anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibody status (p less than 0.001), chronic active hepatitis on liver biopsy (p less than 0.005), high AST level (p less than 0.001), low hepatitis B virus DNA level (p less than 0.001) and a history of acute hepatitis (p less than 0.005) were all associated with an increased likelihood of response on univariate analysis. On stepwise logistic regression analysis, hepatitis B virus DNA, AST and a history of acute hepatitis predicted response independently (p less than 0.05). The most reliable combination of predictive factors was a negative anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibody status, with either a positive history of acute icteric hepatitis and AST greater than 45 IU per liter or no history of acute icteric hepatitis and AST greater than 85 IU per liter, which predicted response in 77% with a specificity of 79% (p less than 0.001). The loss of HBsAg in addition to HBeAg and hepatitis B virus DNA was more likely to occur in patients with chronic infection of less than 2 years duration (p less than 0.001)."

Evidence of past exposure to HBV was found in 148/508 screened donors (29.1%). The most prevalent marker was anti-NBc in 124/508 donors (24.4%), half of whom (63/124) showed anti-HBc only. Anti-HBs prevalence was 15.9%, combined anti-NBc and antiHBs was 12.0% and anti-HBe was 5.7%. Independent risk factors associated with the presence of at least 1 markerwere: being married (OR 3.82), history of blood transfusion (OR 3.04) and parenteral antibilharzial treatment (OR 2.49). Receiving a full HBV vaccination schedule was reported by 39 donors, but only 1 of them had isolated anti-HBs. The relatively high prevalence of HBV exposure necessitates solid infection control measures and adult vaccination programme awareness."
6274,0.005,1.0000,"In humans, hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most prevalent and the main infectious agent that leads to liver disease. Previous investigations identified that long-term HBV-infected patients are unable to eradicate HBV completely from hepatocytes. The main mechanisms responsible for long-term forms of the infections are yet to be clarified. However, researchers believe that the differences in genetic and immunological parameters in the patients in comparison to subjects who successfully clear HBV infections may be the causes for long-term infection. Previous studies demonstrated that chemokines play important roles in the regulation of immune cell migration and activation, which is crucial for a comprehensive immune response against HBV. RANTES, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β are important CC chemokines which act through CC chemokines receptor 5 (CCR5). This receptor is expressed on several effector immune cells including NK cells, T lymphocytes, and macrophages, and plays a crucial role in the regulation of activation and migration of the immune cells during immune responses against viruses, including HBV. Therefore, alterations in its expression or functions could be associated with attenuated immune responses against HBV. In addition, previous studies identified that a 32 base pair deletion (Δ32) in exon 1, as well as three polymorphisms in the promoter region of the CCR5 gene results in downregulation of the molecule. Previous studies revealed that CCR5 expression was altered in hepatitis B but the role of the CCR5 Δ32 mutation and CCR5 promoter polymorphisms in this disease is controversial. This review addresses the recent information regarding the status of CCR5 expression on immune cells and the association of CCR5 promoter polymorphisms with HBV-infected patients."
3048,0.005,1.0000,"HBV is a noncytopathic hepadnavirus and major human pathogen that causes immune-mediated acute and chronic hepatitis. The immune response to HBV antigens is age dependent: viral clearance occurs in most adults, while neonates and children usually develop chronic infection and liver disease. Here, we characterize an animal model for HBV infection that recapitulates the key differences in viral clearance between early life and adulthood and find that IL-21 may be part of an effective primary hepatic immune response to HBV. In our model, adult mice showed higher HBV-dependent IL-21 production in liver, compared with that of young mice. Conversely, absence of the IL-21 receptor in adult mice resulted in antigen persistence akin to that of young mice. In humans, levels of IL-21 transcripts were greatly increased in blood samples from acutely infected adults who clear the virus. These observations suggest a different model for the dichotomous, age dependent outcome of HBV infection in humans, in which decreased IL-21 production in younger patients may hinder generation of crucial CD8+ T and B cell responses. These findings carry implications for therapeutic augmentation of immune responses to HBV and potentially other persistent liver viruses."
12561,0.005,1.0000,"Liver specimens of 31 autopsied cases of liver cirrhosis who had had detectable levels of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) inthe serum were stained for hepatitis  B core antigen (HBcAg) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg) by the direct immunofluorescence method. Their premortem serum samples were tested for HBSAg, antibody to HBSAg (anti-HBS) and anti-HBC. Persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection as judged by circulating and/or liver HB antigens was identified in 18 patients, and all of them revealed a high titer of anti-HBC ranging from 2(11) to 2(16) by the immune adherence hemagglutination method. In contrast, anti-HBC titer of the remaining 13 patients without detectable HB antigens was less than 2(9), and the geometric mean titer of anti-HBC of the patients with persistent HBV infection was significantly higher than that of the patients without (13.9+/-1.55 versus 7.23+/-1.30; t test, P less than 0.001). A combination of circulating anti-HBS and hepatic HB antigens was found in one patient, whose serum revealed an anti-HBC titer of 2(12). On the basis of these results, a high titer of anti-HBC in the serum (immune adherence hemagglutination titer of 2(11) or more) seems to be a reliable indicator of persistent HBV infection in the liver."
16191,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants have recently been identified in patients with acute or fulminant as well as chronic infections. Naturally occurring mutations have been identified in all viral genes and regulatory elements. Mutations in the gene coding for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) may result in infection or viral persistence despite the presence of antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs) (""vaccine escape"" or ""immune escape""). Mutations in the gene encoding the pre-core/core protein (pre-core stop codon mutant) result in a loss of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and sero-conversion to antibodies to HBeAg (anti-HBe) with persistence of HBV replication (HBeAg minus mutant). Mutations in the core gene may lead among others to an immune escape due to a T cell receptor antagonism. Mutations in the polymerase gene can be associated with viral persistence or resistance to nucleoside analogues. Thus, HBV mutations may affect the natural course of infection, viral clearance and response to antiviral therapy. The exact contribution of specific mutations to diagnosis and therapy of HBV infection as well as patient management in clinical practice remain to be established."
13264,0.005,1.0000,"Several studies have reported that antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) positivity may influence the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis C patients, but the evidence is still not conclusive. In this study, we examined whether the presence of anti-HBc positive was associated with the development of HCC in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected subjects among the residents in an HCV hyperepidemic area who were followed up for 12 years. In an HCV hyperendemic area (positive rate of anti-HCV: 23.4%), 509 residents were examined by health screening in 1990. After 12 years of follow-up, we evaluated the risk factors for HCC. The incidence of HCC was compared between anti-HBc positive and anti-HBc negative subjects after 12 years of prospective observation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine risk factors for the development of HCC. The incidence of HCC was significantly higher in the anti-HBc positive group (13 subjects) than in the anti-HBc negative group (0 subjects) (P=0.012). Multivariate analysis identified positivity for anti-HBc and HCV RNA, history of icterus, and female gender as independent determinants of the development of HCC. Our findings provide clear evidence in a prospective study that presence of anti-HBc, that is, past hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, is a risk factor for the development of HCC in HCV-infected people."
19193,0.005,1.0000,"The natural history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is probably related to host immune factors. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) plays significant roles in immune defense. This study was undertaken to investigate the association between HBV infection and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IFN-gamma, IFN-gamma receptor (IFNGR)-1 and 2, and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 genes. Between March 2002 and December 2002, 614 Korean patients were enrolled in two different groups: an HBV clearance group (n = 201), who were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative with antibodies to HBsAg and hepatitis B core antigen, and an HBV persistence group (n = 413), who were repeatedly HBsAg positive. We assessed polymorphisms in the IFN-gamma gene at position +874, in the IFNGR-1 gene at positions -56 and +95, in the IFNGR-2 gene at the second position of codon 64 (Gln64Arg), and in the IRF-1 gene promoter (-410, -388), and the genotype distributions of the HBV clearance and persistence groups were compared. On the basis of unconditional logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age and sex, no statistically significant association with susceptibility to persistent HBV infection was observed with the IFN-gamma, IFNGR-1 and 2, and IRF-1 gene polymorphisms under the codominant, dominant, and recessive models."
748,0.005,1.0000,"HIV infection has led to an increase of both AIDS defining and non-AIDS defining cancers. Immunosuppressive cancer therapy had been noted for increased HIV viral load in cancer patients infected with HIV before the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Assessing the outcome of concomitant HAART and cancer treatment in regions endemic for HIV is thus important. From a cohort of 34 cancer patients infected with HIV, 10 (six underwent radiotherapy and four chemotherapy) had at least three serial samples collected before, during and after treatment. From each sample, HIV viral load, CD4 +  and CD8 +  cell count was investigated. HIV genotypic drug resistance was assessed for six patients with a detectable HIV viral load at baseline. Of the 10 patients; one was HIV positive only, three were HIV and HBV co-infected and six were HIV, HBV and HCV triple infected. Four patients were HAART experienced at recruitment, while six were HAART naive with detectable HIV viral loads. A significant HIV viral load decrease (P = 0.0128) was observed in all six patients with detectable baseline HIV viral loads. The four patients on HAART at recruitment maintained lower than detectable HIV viral load status throughout cancer therapy. A positive correlation between the rise in CD4 +  cell count and attaining a lower than detectable HIV viral load was also observed (P = 0.0439). This pilot study supports concomitant treatment of HIV/AIDS and cancer in HIV endemic regions irrespective of the type of cancer diagnosed, prescribed cancer therapy or other viral (HBV, HCV or both) co-infections."
15031,0.005,1.0000,"Decreased insulin sensitivity, hyperlipidemia, and body fat changes are considered as risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). A clustering of such factors (metabolic syndrome [MSDR]) exponentially increases the risk. Impaired fibrinolysis and increased coagulation are additional independent risk factors for CHD. We studied the effects of protease inhibitor (PI)-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on metabolic and hemostatic parameters in 363 HIV-infected individuals, of whom 266 were receiving PI-containing HAART and 97 were treatment naive. The fasting plasma levels of insulin, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), and fibrinogen were evaluated together with the areas of visceral adipose tissue and the visceral adipose tissue/subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio. The levels of insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; visceral adipose tissue area; low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein ratio; and visceral adipose tissue/subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio were significantly increased in patients receiving PI-containing HAART compared with treatment-naive patients. The levels of PAI-1 and fibrinogen were significantly higher in patients receiving PI-containing HAART. PAI-1 levels were higher in individuals with MSDR but also in patients without MSDR who were receiving PI-containing HAART. PAI-1 was independently correlated to use of PI-containing HAART, triglyceride level, insulin level, and body mass index (p <.001). These findings suggest that patients receiving PI-containing HAART have decreased fibrinolysis and increased coagulability, which may thus represent additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease in this patient group."
17436,0.005,1.0000,"Rapid virologic response (RVR) and complete early virologic response (cEVR) are associated with sustained virologic response to hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy. We retrospectively examined baseline and on-treatment factors associated with RVR (HCV RNA undetectable at week 4) and cEVR (HCV RNA undetectable at week 12, regardless of week 4 response). The analysis comprised 1550 HCV genotype-1 patients from five clinical trials, including three enriched with difficult-to-treat populations, randomized to peginterferon alfa-2a 180 microg/week plus ribavirin 1000-1200 mg/day. Overall, 15.6% achieved RVR and 54.0% achieved cEVR. Baseline factors predictive of RVR were serum HCV RNA <or= 400,000 IU/mL (OR: 7.34; P < 0.0001), alanine aminotransferase >3 x ULN (OR: 2.01; P < 0.0001), non-cirrhotic status (OR: 1.92; P = 0.0087), age <or= 40 years (OR: 1.56; P = 0.0085), white non-Latino ethnicity (OR: 1.41; P = 0.0666) and individual study (P < 0.0001). These factors plus body mass index <or= 27 kg/m(2) were predictive of cEVR. After adjusting for these factors, mean on-treatment ribavirin dose >13 mg/kg/day was predictive of RVR (OR: 1.69; P = 0.005) and cEVR (OR: 1.24; P = 0.09), whereas peginterferon alfa-2a dose reduction was not. Greater decreases in haematologic parameters were observed in patients who achieved cEVR compared with patients who did not. In conclusion, several baseline and on-treatment factors were associated with RVR and cEVR to peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin in difficult-to-treat HCV genotype-1 patients, providing important prognostic information on the antiviral response in a patient cohort that is reflective of the general chronic hepatitis C population."

Clinical data concerning consecutive HIV patients treated for DLBCL located in head and neck region with CHT and RT were retrospectively reviewed. Systemic treatment consisted of combination CHT agents given with concomitant HAART and regimen was left to oncologists' discretion. Involved field RT was delivered at a total dose of 30-36 Gy (2 Gy per fraction). Survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was evaluated using National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Overall, 13 patients were included. There were no missing data. Eight patients had advanced disease (stage III-IV = 8; 61.5%). The most common primary tumor location was oral cavity (n = 7) with large mass at presentation. All patients completed the programmed treatment. Severe acute toxicity was observed in one patient, only. Overall, three patients had died and no treatment-related deaths occurred. After a median follow-up of 152 months, the 20-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 65.9 and 41.5%, respectively. Globally, there were no RT-related late complications. This data analysis suggested that CHT followed by RT can be safety proposed in the management of patients with HIV-related HN-DLBCL in the HAART era. Further investigations are necessary to validate our results."
13516,0.005,1.0000,"Since the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV is considered a chronic disease. Adherence to HAART is crucial for effectiveness. Non-adherence negatively impacts patient outcome and the larger economy. However, data on adherence among the Belgian HIV cohort are scarce. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to identify determinants of adherence among HIV patients treated in Belgium. The study was conducted at the Aids Reference Centre of Ghent University Hospital between 1 January and 31 December 2012. Sociodemographic data were collected, along with the Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ), the Center for Adherence Support Evaluation (CASE) Adherence Index, the EuroQol-6D, the Medical Outcomes Study-HIV (MOS-HIV), the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and three neurocognitive complaints screening questions. To date, 218 patients participated in the study, among whom 173 (79·4%) were male. Mean age was 46·0±10·6 years and 133 patients (63·9%) were homosexual. According to the SMAQ and the CASE, 78·5% and 93·5% of the patients were adherent to antiretroviral therapy. Logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking, neurocognitive complaints, and female sex were independent determinants of non-adherence. In conclusion, there is an elevated risk for non-adherence in smokers, people experiencing neurocognitive problems, and women in our sample. The latter could reflect differences between male and female HIV patients in Belgium. Adherence improving initiatives should be tailored to these three risk groups. "
6999,0.005,1.0000,"The direct measurement of the incidence of new infections with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be made among soldiers because of the routine and periodic nature of HIV-1 testing in the United States Army. Between November 1985 and October 1993, 978 HIV-1 seroconversions were seen among 1,061,768 soldiers, contributing over 3.6 million person-years of follow-up [seroconversion rate (95% confidence interval) = 0.27/1,000 person-years (0.25-0.29)]. A significant decreasing trend in HIV-1 seroconversion rates was seen over the analysis period. The rate of new infections declined significantly from the first interval, 1985-1987, (0.43/1,000 person-years) to the second interval, 1987-1988, (0.28/1,000 person-years), but stabilized at approximately 0.22/1,000 person-years after 1988, representing new infections in approximately 100-150 soldiers annually. The risk of seroconversion among active duty soldiers was significantly associated with racial/ethnic group, age, gender, and marital status. Surveillance of HIV-1 seroconversion rates in the U.S. Army continues to offer a unique opportunity to assess temporal trends in the evolving HIV-1 infection epidemic. Monitoring the rate of new HIV-1 infections allows for identification of subgroups in need of intervention, refocusing of intervention strategies, and evaluation of their effectiveness."

The Malawi Ministry of Health conducts periodic evaluations of HIVDR development in prospective cohorts at sentinel clinics. We evaluated viral load suppression, HIVDR, and factors associated with HIVDR in 4 ART sites at 12-15 months after ART initiation. More than 70% of patients initiating ART had viral suppression at 12 months. HIVDR prevalence (6.1%) after 12 months of ART was low and largely associated with baseline HIVDR. Better follow-up, removal of barriers to on-time drug pickups, and adherence education for patients 16-24 years of age may further prevent HIVDR."

This study was designed to evaluate the pretreatment and 12 month follow-up monitoring of clinical and laboratory profiles of HIV-infected patients at the adult HIV clinic of the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, in Nigeria. It was a retrospective analysis of records of 440 adult patients who were on follow-up visits for 1 or more years. Two hundred two (45.9%) were male and 238 (54.1%) were female. Weight was documented at baseline in 314 (71.4%) and at month 12 of follow-up in 258 (58.6%). Baseline World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage was documented in 269 (61.1%). Baseline CD4 count, full blood count (FBC), creatinine (Cr), liver function tests (LFT), fasting blood sugar (FBS), and fasting serum lipids (FSL) were documented in 243 (55.6%), 260 (59.1%), 143 (32.5%), 136 (30.9%), 268 (60.9%), and 161 (36.6%), respectively.

3434,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) resistance to lamivudine has not been extensively documented in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. We studied the long-term incidence of HBV resistance to lamivudine in HIV-positive patients. Sixty-six HIV-HBV-coinfected patients were studied while receiving lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) as a part of antiretroviral therapy. All these patients had a detectable serum HBV DNA at the beginning of lamivudine therapy. Serum HBV DNA was quantified by molecular hybridization. Sequence analysis of the HBV polymerase was performed in patients who became resistant to lamivudine. After 2 months of lamivudine, HBV DNA became undetectable in 57 patients (86.4%, 95% CI: 75.7%-93.6%). After 2 years of lamivudine, 47% +/- 18.6% of the patients, had sustained HBV-DNA suppression. All the 22 tested patients with HBV resistance developed mutation at position 550 in the YMDD motif of the DNA polymerase. None of the following variables were associated with an increased risk of lamivudine resistance: age, associated protease inhibitor therapy, Center for Disease Control (CDC) stage C, known HIV-infection duration, serum HBV-DNA level at baseline, CD4 cell count and serum alanine transaminase levels at baseline and at HBV-replication suppression (2 months of lamivudine). Lamivudine (300 mg/d) is effective for the inhibition of HBV replication in HIV-infected patients. However, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV may occur in 20% of patients per year."

We assessed this using updated administrative data from an open retrospective cohort of HIV-infected persons receiving care from the US Veterans Affairs (VA). Information on 41,213 HIV-infected patients receiving VA care between January 1993 and December 2003 was included. Patients were followed for an average of 4 years or 168,213 person-years of follow-up. The death rate fell from 20.9 deaths per 100 patient-years of observation in 1995 to 5.2 deaths per 100 patient-years in 2003. In patient-level analysis, adjusted hazard ratios for death dropped precipitously for all races to a low of 0.18 (95% confidence interval: 0.15 to 0.23) at 72 months of exposure to HAART. Hazards for serious cardiovascular events remained near 1.0 for exposure to HAART, and hazards for serious cardiovascular events, stroke, or death were only slightly higher than for death alone. No selection effects or secular trends were found. The benefits of HAART continued to increase in the 8 years after introduction and with 6 years of individual use. The risk of serious cardiovascular events should be factored into individual patient management but does not pose an important public health risk."

Therefore, characterizing such persons can help direct prevention efforts to a group who are likely to be continuing sources of HIV transmission. We assessed the incidence and factors associated with trichomoniasis in a cohort of HIV-infected women receiving care at a public clinic in Los Angeles County, California from 1992 through 1995. Demographic, clinical, and behavioral data were available from medical records and from patient interviews. Trichomonas infection was the most frequently identified sexually transmitted disease and was found in 37 (17.4%) of 212 women representing a crude incidence rate of 14.1 per 100 person-years experience. The crude rate of trichomoniasis was highest in black women (69.0 per 100 person-years), women with a history of trading sex for drugs or money (51.0 per 100 person-years), those using crack or cocaine (35.5 per 100 person-years), women with four or more sex partners (43.0 per 100 person years), and those born in the United States (23.3 per 100 person-years). Among women with severe immunosuppression (CD4+ count < 200), 18.4% (18 of 98) were diagnosed with trichomoniasis. After multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazards approach, black race (adjusted rate ratio [RR] = 5.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.3, 13.3) continued to be strongly associated with Trichomonas infection. Trading sex for money or drugs (adjusted RR = 25.2, 95% CI = 4.3, 148.6) and single marital status (adjusted RR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.1, 13.0) were independent risk factors for trichomoniasis in nonblack women but not among black women. Data from this study indicate that Trichomonas may be a frequently acquired infection in HIV-positive women. Our findings suggest that HIV-infected women who are black, and nonblack women who trade sex for money or drugs or are unmarried, are at increased risk of trichomoniasis and therefore may be more likely to transmit HIV infection. Local HIV prevention strategies should target such women for intervention efforts."

Data are from a 2-year prospective, observational, multisite study of 1030 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and advanced AIDS-related complex who received zidovudine. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma developed in 24 (2.3%) of 1030 patients who received zidovudine during 1463 person-years of follow-up (rate, 1.6 per 100 person-years of therapy). The relative hazard for development of NHL was stable throughout 2 years of therapy, with the risk of developing NHL 0.8% for each additional 6 months of therapy. Factors associated with development of NHL were a prior diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma, herpes simplex virus infection, or lower mean neutrophil count. Less strongly associated was a prior diagnosis of oral hairy leukoplakia or homosexual transmission of HIV. By Cox proportional hazards analysis, a prior diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma, cytomegalovirus disease, or oral hairy leukoplakia was most strongly associated with development of NHL. Our study demonstrates a relatively high incidence of NHL in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus disease who are undergoing antiretroviral therapy and suggests possible risk factors for development of NHL."

The mean CD4 cell count reached a peak of 64 cells/mm3 above baseline at week 8 (P = .005 compared to baseline) and remained above baseline for > 40 weeks. Patients also gained weight and had decreases in serum HIV p24 antigen. Eight patients developed opportunistic infections or tumors. Only 4 patients died during 3 years of follow-up.

Little data is available on the response of children infected with hepatitis C treated with combination therapy, especially those with bleeding disorders. We wish to report a single paediatric haemophilia treatment center's results of treatment of adolescents with haemophilia and hepatitis C infection with combination therapy. All patients followed at the haemophilia treatment center with hepatitis C, who were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and had a measurable hepatitis C viral load were eligible. Study patients received at least 6 months of 3 MU interferon-alpha via subcutaneous injection three times per week and 1000 mg day(-1) of ribavirin. Eleven patients agreed to participate in the study. Three patients had an un measurable viral load after 6 months of combination therapy. All three completed 12 months of medication and continued to remain free of hepatitis C for 12 months after discontinuation of therapy. Side-effects of combination therapy were significant but tolerable. The sustained response rate in this study is similar to the historical response rate seen in adults but less than the other reported response rates seen in children treated with combination therapy. Given the toxicity of combination therapy, and natural history of hepatitis C infection in children, consideration of a liver biopsy to evaluate disease progression prior to considering antiviral medications is warranted."
8044,0.005,1.0000,"Low adherence and toxicities among HIV-positive patients starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can lead to discontinuation of therapy and treatment failure. Little is known about hepatitis C (HCV) status and discontinuation of HAART. Poisson regression was used to determine factors related to discontinuation of any part of an initial HAART regimen due to treatment failure (TF) or toxicities and patient/ physician choice (TOX), and to investigate the relationship between HCV and discontinuation of a HAART regimen in 1198 patients staring HAART after 1999 from the EuroSIDA study. At 1 year after starting HAART, 70% of patients remained on their original regimen, 24% had changed, and 6% were off all treatment. The most frequent reason for discontinuation was toxicities (30.4%). The incidence of any discontinuation was significantly lower after 1999 compared to before [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.43; 95% CI 0.35-0.53, p < 0.0001], this pattern was most marked for toxicities (IRR 0.28; 95% CI 0.20-0.39, p < 0.0001) and patient/physician choice (IRR 0.49; 95% CI 0.33-0.73, p < 0.0001). Patients with HCV had a higher incidence of discontinuation due to TOX (IRR 1.46, 95% CI 1.13-1.88, p = 0.0042) compared to patients without HCV. Patients with HCV were more likely to discontinue all or part of their HAART regimens due to toxicity or patient/physician choice. Managing adverse events must remain a key intervention in maintaining HAART. There is a need for further studies to describe the relationship between HCV, specific antiretrovirals, and different treatment strategies."

We aimed to explore barriers to access and uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among HIV-positive men who have sex with men in Hanoi. During 2015, we conducted qualitative interviews with 35 participants recruited using snowball sampling based on previous research and social networks. Key individual impediments to ART uptake included inadequate preparation for a positive diagnosis and the dual stigmatisation of homosexuality and HIV and its consequences, leading to fear of disclosure of HIV status. Health system barriers included lack of clarity and consistency about how to register for and access ART, failure to protect patient confidentiality and a reticence by providers to discuss sexual identity and same-sex issues. Results suggest fundamental problems in the way HIV testing is currently delivered in Hanoi, including a lack of client-centred counselling, peer support and clear referral pathways. Overcoming these barriers will require educating men who have sex with men about the benefits of routine testing, improving access to quality diagnostic services and building a safe, confidential treatment environment for HIV-positive men to access, receive and remain in care."

In unadjusted analyses, detectable HIV viral load (vs undetectable, <400 copies/mL) was associated with a 40% greater odds (OR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.9, P = 0.016) of FIB-4 > 1.45 in the HIV/HCV-coinfected group and 70% greater odds of FIB-4 > 1.45 (OR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0-2.8; P = 0.046) in the HIV-mono-infected group. In multivariable analyses, a 1 log(10) increase in HIV RNA was associated with a median increase in FIB-4 of 12% in the HIV/HCV-coinfected group and 11% in the HIV-mono-infected group (P < 0.0001). Among the HIV/HCV-coinfected group, the elevating effect of HIV RNA on FIB-4 was strongest at low CD4 counts (P = 0.0037). Among the HIV-mono-infected group, the association between HIV RNA and FIB-4 was independent of CD4 cell counts. HIV RNA was associated with alterations in both liver enzymes and platelet counts. HIV antiretroviral therapy was not associated with any measure of liver injury examined. This study suggests that HIV may have direct, injurious effects on the liver and that HIV viral load should be considered when these indirect markers are used to assess liver function."
3975,0.005,1.0000,"The relationship between adherence, antiretroviral regimen, and viral load (VL) suppression was assessed through a 1 year prospective follow-up study among 1142 HIV-infected patient. Patients on antiretroviral therapy who attended to the pharmacy during a 6-month period were considered eligible. Those included in the final analysis were patients who had been taking the same antiretroviral therapy for > or =6 months since their inclusion. The cohort included patients taking first line therapy (n = 243) and antiretroviral-experienced patients (n = 899). Naive patients who were included had to have reached undetectable VL at enrollment. Antiretroviral-experienced patients with detectable VL determinations in the previous 6 months were excluded. Adherence was measured by means of announced pill counts and dispensation pharmacy records. Of patients, 58% were taking NNRTI, 31.4% boosted PI, and 10.6% unboosted PI-based regimens. Overall, the relative risk of virologic failure was 9.0 (95% CI 4.0-20.1) in patients with adherence 80-89.9%, 45.6 (95% CI 19.9-104.5) with adherence 70-79.9%, and 77.3 (95% CI 34.2-174.9) with adherence <70%, compared with adherence of > or =90%. The risk of virologic failure in patients with adherence <90% taking unboosted PI was 2.5 times higher than the group taking boosted PI (95% CI 1.2-5.3). There were no statistical differences in patients taking boosted PI and those who were taking NNRTI. Less than 95% of adherence is associated with high virologic success. For patients taking NNRTI- or boosted PI-based regimens with adherence rates of 80%, the failure rate is <10%. These data do not affect the goal of achieving the highest level of adherence possible."

Seroprevalence data along with patient demographic information were compared to a similar study performed in 1985-1986. In the earlier study, 12 (12.5%) of 96 individuals tested positive for HIV-1. Of the 74 available negative samples retested in 1987-1988 for retroviruses, 7 (9.5%) tested positive for HTLV-I/II. Thus, the overall retroviral (HIV-1, HTLV-I/II) seropositive rate for 1985-1986 was 22%. In 1987-1988, 11 (15.7%) of 70 individuals tested positive for HIV-1 and 7 (10%) tested positive for HTLV-I/II. Concomitant infection with both viruses was found in 2 (2.9%) of the 70 individuals. Thus, retrovirus seroprevalence in 1987-1988 was 22.9%. In 1987-1988, significant differences between the retroviral-positive group and the retroviral-negative group consisted of intravenous drug use greater than 16 years (P = 0.059) for an odds ratio of 3.80 (CI 1.12-12.89) and sex with female prostitutes (P = 0.029) for an odds ratio of 5.38 (CI 1.38-20.95)."
4636,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the incidence, determinants and significance of delayed clearance of serum HBsAg in chronic hepatitis B virus infection, a prospective follow-up study was conducted in two consecutive groups of patients. Group I consisted of 984 patients (859 men and 125 women) with biopsy-proven chronic type B hepatitis, whereas group II consisted of 1,598 asymptomatic chronic carriers (998 men and 600 women) with normal serum aminotransferase activity. During a mean follow-up period of 4.0 +/- 2.3 yr, 19 patients (1.9%) of group I cleared HBsAg from their serum, whereas 35 patients (2.2%) in group II did so in a mean follow-up period of 2.7 +/- 1.4 yr. The annual incidence of delayed serum HBsAg clearance was 0.5% in group I and 0.8% in group II (p less than 0.02). The cumulative probability of HBsAg clearance was also higher in group II than in group I (p less than 0.007). Antibodies to HBsAg developed in 9 patients (47.4%) with chronic hepatitis and in 11 (31.4%) asymptomatic carriers who cleared serum HBsAg. Those who were HBeAg negative and those older than 40 at entry and those who exhibited cirrhosis during follow-up had a higher incidence of delayed HBsAg clearance. Gender, initial histological changes and hepatitis delta virus infection did not influence the occurrence of HBsAg clearance. Serum HBV DNA was not detectable by slot-blot hybridization but was still detectable by polymerase chain reaction in serum specimens collected within 1 yr of HBsAg clearance. Liver biopsy performed later in 10 patients showed no significant hepatitis activity or tissue HBV DNA, HBsAg or HBcAg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
18587,0.005,1.0000,"This study was designed to assess the in vitro effects of morphine on the lymphocytes infected with SIV. CEM x174 cells were cotreated with morphine and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac239). Cells were cultured for 96 h and the effects of morphine on the viability of infected cells were determined. At the concentration of 1 micromol/l, morphine could inhibit the proliferation of CEM x174 cells at the culture of 72 h. The stronger effect was observed in the case of viral infection. During 72 h SIV loading, the cells were accumulated in S phase in all SIV infected groups. The S arrest was observed in every experimental group and statistically different from normal groups (P<0.05). The results from annexin V binding assay showed that SIV infection resulted in a lower proportion of vital cells and higher mortality compared with corresponding control (P<0.01). Morphine failed to induce detectable alteration in the cell cycle profile of viral infected cells. Western blotting showed that the synthesis of intracellular p53 and bax protein was gradually up-regulated in the virus-loading period of 72 h. Naloxone had an apparent additive rather than antagonistic effect on the morphine-associated enhancement of bax expression. The ratio of bax/bcl-2 proteins appeared to tilt the balance toward apoptosis. At 72 h of infection, 1 micromol/l of morphine significantly elevated the level of caspase-3. These results indicated that the alteration in the balance of intracellular apoptotic and anti-apoptotic elements is one of the reasons of accelerated progression of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) by opioids abuse."

Also we studied the distribution of HBV among the health workers of the Centre (N = 100). We investigate in all the subjects (patients and employees) three variables: 1) patients with any marker of HBV present, 2) carriers of HBV, and 3) their infectivity (HBeAg+). To know an estimate of risk of HBV we design a matched case-control study and we controlled the confounding factors as age, sex, duration of institutional stay and contacts with HBV before institutionalization. Before matching, the crude data were: Patients with any marker of HBV were 123 (49%); employees: 17 (17%). Clients with HBsAg: 35 (14%); and health workers 1(1%). Antigen HBe+ in clients 22(62%) and nobody among the employees. We compare the group of patients with DS and the others inmates and we obtained: Any marker among DS's 51 (69%) and 72 (40%) in the group of NDS's. They were 22 (30%) carriers among DS patients and 13 (7.30%) in the other clients. It was HBeAg present in 18 (82%) in DS's and 4 (30%) in patients with NDS.

Four hundred fifty-four Asian-American HBeAg-positive HBV carriers, followed for 1-10 years, were tested approximately every 6 months for HBeAg. Patients with alanine aminotransferase levels > or = 50 IU/mL at entry had 1067.3 seroconversions/10(5) person-months in the 5- to 19-year age group, 1753.3 in the 20- to 34-year group, and 1257.2 in the 35- to 50-year group. Published data indicate that 30% of children and 33% of adults seroconvert during interferon-alpha treatment and follow-up. In our study population, spontaneous seroconversion occurred in 15% of children (95% confidence interval [CI], 8%-27%), 23% of adults 20-34 years (95% CI, 15%-34%), and 17% of adults 35-50 years (95% CI, 10%-28%) during the same interval. The high rate of spontaneous seroconversion should be weighed in decisions to treat HBV carriers with interferon-alpha."
2017,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of the present study was to assess the pharmacokinetic behavior of atazanavir-ritonavir when it is coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Eleven patients enrolled in Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le SIDA (National Agency for AIDS Research, Paris, France) trial 107 were included in this pharmacokinetic study. They received atazanavir at 300 mg and ritonavir at 100 mg once a day (QD) from day 1 to the end of study. For the first 2 weeks, their nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatments remained unchanged. Tenofovir DF was administered QD from day 15 to the end of the study. Ongoing NRTIs were selected according to the reverse transcriptase genotype of the HIV isolates from each patient. The values of the pharmacokinetic parameters for atazanavir and ritonavir were measured before (day 14 [week 2]) and after (day 42 [week 6]) initiation of tenofovir DF and are reported for the 10 patients who completed the study. There was a significant decrease in the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC(0-24)) for atazanavir with the addition of tenofovir DF (AUC(0-24) ratio, 0.75; 90% confidence interval, 0.58 to 0.97; P = 0.05). There was a trend for a decrease in the minimum concentrations of atazanavir and ritonavir in plasma when they were combined with tenofovir, but none of the differences reached statistical significance. The median decreases in the HIV RNA loads at week 2 and week 6 were 0.1 and 0.2 log copies/ml, respectively. In summary, our data are consistent with the existence of a significant interaction between atazanavir and tenofovir DF."
19530,0.005,1.0000,"Reports of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission associated with unsafe medical practices have been increasing in the United States. However, the contribution of healthcare exposures to the burden of new infections is poorly understood outside of recognized outbreaks. We conducted a case-control study at three health departments that perform enhanced viral hepatitis surveillance in New York and Oregon. Reported cases of symptomatic acute hepatitis B and hepatitis C occurring in persons≥55 years of age from 2006 to 2008 were enrolled. Controls were identified using telephone directories and matched to individual cases by age group (55-59, 60-69, and ≥70 years) and residential postal code. Data collection covered exposures within 6 months before symptom onset (cases) or date of interview (controls). Forty-eight (37 hepatitis B and 11 hepatitis C) case and 159 control patients were enrolled. Case patients were more likely than controls to report one or more behavioral risk exposures, including sexual or household contact with an HBV or HCV patient, >1 sex partner, illicit drug use, or incarceration (21% of cases versus 4% of controls exposed; matched odds ratio [mOR]=7.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.1, 24.1). Case patients were more likely than controls to report hemodialysis (8% of cases; mOR=13.0; 95% CI: 1.5, 115), injections in a healthcare setting (58%; mOR=2.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.3), and surgery (33%; mOR=2.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.7). In a multivariate model, behavioral risks (adjusted OR [aOR]=5.4; 95% CI: 1.5, 19.0; 17% attributable risk), injections (aOR=2.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.8; 37% attributable risk), and hemodialysis (aOR=11.5; 95% CI: 1.2, 107; 8% attributable risk) were associated with case status."
1277,0.005,1.0000,"The high prevalence of HIV-associated comorbidities including neurocognitive disorder, high levels of residual inflammatory mediators in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid and the resurgence of HIV replication upon interruption of antiviral treatment in HIV-1 infected individuals, strongly suggests that despite therapy HIV persists in its cellular targets which include T-lymphocytes and cells of the myeloid lineage. These reservoirs present a major barrier against eradication efforts. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms used by HIV to modulate innate macrophage immune responses and impair viral clearance is quite limited. To explore the role of HIV in potentially modulating macrophage function through changes in protein expression, we used single-cell analyses with flow cytometry to determine whether, in unpolarized cultures, macrophage surface marker phenotype was altered by HIV infection in a manner that was independent of host genetic background."
10884,0.005,1.0000,"Brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) are targets of CD4-independent infection by HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains in vitro and in vivo. Infection of BCECs may provide a portal of entry for the virus into the central nervous system and could disrupt blood-brain barrier function, contributing to the development of AIDS dementia. We found that rhesus macaque BCECs express chemokine receptors involved in HIV and SIV entry including CCR5, CCR3, CXCR4, and STRL33, but not CCR2b, GPR1, or GPR15. Infection of BCECs by the neurovirulent strain SIV/17E-Fr was completely inhibited by aminooxypentane regulation upon activation, normal T cell expression and secretion in the presence or absence of ligands, but not by eotaxin or antibodies to CD4. We found that the envelope (env) proteins from SIV/17E-Fr and several additional SIV strains mediated cell-cell fusion and virus infection with CD4-negative, CCR5-positive cells. In contrast, fusion with cells expressing the coreceptors STRL33, GPR1, and GPR15 was CD4-dependent. These results show that CCR5 can serve as a primary receptor for SIV in BCECs and suggest a possible CD4-independent mechanism for blood-brain barrier disruption and viral entry into the central nervous system."
1759,0.005,1.0000,We report a patient who developed multiple inflammatory muscle masses and generalized polymyositis in the setting of combined human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of muscles showed patchy edema which was particularly intense within the nodular masses. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed no evidence of either virus within muscle. This report reviews earlier literature on muscle nodules associated with myositis and discusses the differential diagnosis of muscle masses in HIV infection.
19896,0.005,1.0000,"Although skeletal muscle abnormalities have been described in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the effects of HIV infection on respiratory muscle function have not been well characterized. We hypothesized that HIV+ individuals may develop respiratory muscle weakness and that respiratory muscle dysfunction may contribute to the unexplained dyspnea that occurs in the setting of HIV. To test this hypothesis we studied maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), inspiratory muscle endurance, and respiratory symptoms in 23 HIV+ male outpatients who had no history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related pulmonary complications, with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 331.6 +/- 62.1 (mean +/- SEM). Respiratory muscle endurance was measured with an incremental threshold loading (ITL) protocol. We compared these results to those for 14 HIV- males matched for age and weight. Compared with the controls, HIV+ subjects had a significantly lower mean MIP (98.7 +/- 7.4 versus 121.4 +/- 9.3 cm H2O, p < 0.05) and MEP (115.0 +/- 9.3 versus 152.1 +/- 14.8 cm H2O, p < 0.05). Furthermore, during ITL, the mean load at task failure in the HIV+ group was 295.7 +/- 36.2 g, versus 405.8 +/- 52.2 g in the control group (p < 0.05). In the HIV+ subjects there was no relationship between muscle performance and CD4+ count or azidothymidine (AZT) use. There was, however, a highly significant relationship between respiratory muscle dysfunction and symptoms of dyspnea. We conclude that HIV seropositivity is associated with a decline in respiratory muscle performance. This impairment in respiratory muscle function may contribute to the feeling of breathlessness that has been well described in this patient population."
4097,0.005,1.0000,"Therapeutic goals for HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy include minimizing risk of future physical disability. Presarcopenia and sarcopenia precede age-associated physical disability. We investigated their prevalence and the predictive value of patient mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) for them. Eighty community-dwelling patients ≥45 years old demonstrating durable viral suppression were evaluated. Sarcopenia was defined as low skeletal muscle index (SMI, skeletal muscle kg/height m(2)) and either low strength or poor performance by handgrip dynamometry and gait speed, respectively. Presarcopenia was defined as low SMI only. MUAC was interpreted according to National Health Statistics percentile. Prevalence of sarcopenia and presarcopenia was 5.0% and 20.0%, respectively. Male gender (odds ratio [OR] 10.72; P < .026), recreational psychoactive substance use (OR 5.13; P < .037), and intravenous drug use transmission category (OR 6.94; P <.0327) were associated with presarcopenia. Higher body mass index (OR 0.80; P < .0007), MUAC (OR 0.83; P < .024), and large skeletal frame (OR 0.09; P < .003) were negatively associated with presarcopenia. Finding that a participant did not have a MUAC <25th percentile on physical examination had a 90.4% negative predictive value for presarcopenia. Although sarcopenia was uncommon, presarcopenia was highly prevalent in midlife and older HIV-infected males. Determination of MUAC percentile may identify those least likely to demonstrate skeletal muscle deficit and improve patient selection for mass and function testing. "

Over a period of 13 months, he developed headache, vomiting, insomnia, and diplopia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left parasellar extra-axial mass that was isointense in T1, hypointense in T2, and gadolinium-enhanced. The patient underwent subtotal resection of the tumor. The neoplasm was composed of spindle cells with smooth-muscle features. It showed moderate atypia, inconspicuous nucleoli, and scanty mitosis. No tumor necrosis was detected. The immunohistochemistry revealed strong positivity for vimentin, desmin, and smooth-muscle alpha-actin. A low-grade leiomyosarcoma was diagnosed. The in situ hybridization showed positive nuclear reactivity for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA. The immunohistochemistry was negative for Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1. The main differential diagnosis of primary meningeal smooth-muscle tumors includes meningioma and peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Epstein-Barr virus has been demonstrated in most smooth-muscle tumors associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Primary meningeal smooth-muscle tumors, exceedingly rare neoplasms, remarkably affect young adults with AIDS. Comparatively, most AIDS-related visceral (nonmeningeal) smooth-muscle tumors have been reported in children. The permissiveness and tumorigenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus may depend on the age of human immunodeficiency virus infection."

We report the light-microscopic and ultrastructural findings at autopsy of a 35-year-old woman with AIDS who developed severe lactic acidosis and hepatic failure. The patient had been receiving standard doses of zidovudine for 5 months when she was hospitalized because of the rapid onset of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The most significant findings at autopsy were massive hepatomegaly and steatosis. Ultrastructural examination of the liver and skeletal muscle showed slightly enlarged mitochondria in the liver but no mitochondrial changes in the skeletal muscle. The pathogenesis of mitochondrial toxicity associated with antiviral therapies is briefly discussed."
9183,0.005,1.0000,"A patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) developed a progressive neuromuscular disorder which included a sensory component, severe weakness and muscle wasting, and fasciculations. At autopsy, there was evidence of severe peripheral neuropathy, as well as widespread cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection within the central and peripheral nervous system. Although the anterior horn cell complement within the spinal cord appeared normal, there was also evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-like immunoreactivity of rare anterior horn cells, as judged by immunohistochemical staining. This patient illustrates the complexity of pathogenetic mechanisms operative in AIDS patients with neuromuscular disease, and suggests that at least some examples of neuromuscular disease in patients with this syndrome may be related to widespread CMV infection of the peripheral nerve (including microvascular endothelial cells) and, more rarely, direct HIV infection of some anterior horn cells."
3889,0.005,1.0000,"We report the first case of inclusion body myositis (IBM) which occurred after interferon-alpha treatment for chronic hepatitis C. A 63-year-old man contracted hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) from a blood transfusion at age of 18. At age 57, he was treated with interferon-alpha (IFN alpha) for chronic hepatitis C. A month later, he developed muscle weakness in the proximal part of his lower extremities. IBM was diagnosed after a muscle biopsy at age 62. Steroid therapy improved his muscle power. One year later, worsening of his hepatic condition required re-administration of IFN alpha after gradual decrease and discontinuation of prednisolone. However, several days later, he rapidly became weaker and required a cane to walk. Elevated serum creatine kinase (2,199IU/L) and abnormal intensity in his MRI of thigh were demonstrated. The second muscle biopsy, performed after obtaining the informed consent from our patient, confirmed relapse of IBM. His symptoms improved again after discontinuation of IFN alpha and re-induction of prednisolone. Although a few cases each of IBM associated with HCV or HTLV-1 have been reported, the pathogenesis of virus-associated inflammatory myositis has not been clearly understood. Moreover, there has been no description on IBM associated with IFN alpha treatment, though several cases of polymyositis have been reported. Our case suggests that infection of HCV and HTLV-1 may be immunologically involved in the development of IBM and that IFN alpha can be directly related to onset and relapse of IBM."

15324,0.005,1.0000,"Liver disease epidemiology in sub-Saharan Africa has shifted as a result of HIV and the increased use of antiretroviral therapy leading to a need for updated data on common causes of liver disease. We retrospectively reviewed records from all hospitalized patients who had liver biopsy at a single hospital in South Africa from 2001 to 2009 and compared diagnosis by HIV status. During the period of study 262 patients had liver biopsy, 108 (41%) were HIV-infected, 25 (10%) were HIV-sero-negative, and 129 (49%) had unknown or unrecorded HIV status. Overall 81% of biopsies provided additional diagnostic data. Malignancy was the most common finding reported on 56 (21%) biopsies followed by granuloma or TB, hepatic steatosis, and fibrosis or cirrhosis. HIV-infected patients were more likely to have granulomas and steatosis. Half of patients with granulomas were already on TB treatment, suggesting paradoxical reactions or drug induced liver injury may have been important causes of liver inflammation among these patients. We note that TB, paradoxical reactions during TB treatment, possible drug induced liver injury, and hepatic steatosis are important causes of liver pathology among HIV-infected hospitalized patients with unclear etiology of liver disease after initial assessment. Among HIV sero-negative patients, malignancy was the major cause of liver disease. Our findings re-enforce the importance of TB as a diagnosis among HIV-infected individuals. "
6196,0.005,1.0000,"Routine screening of hospitalized patients for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been suggested as a method to identify undiagnosed HIV infection. To evaluate HIV seroprevalence and rates and risk factors for undiagnosed HIV infection among inpatients at an urban hospital, we linked a blinded HIV seroprevalence survey with data from a health care systemwide HIV surveillance registry. Consecutive nonobstetric adult inpatients admitted over four months had remnant samples of serum and plasma obtained and demographic and clinical data abstracted from hospital registration and outpatient encounter billing files. After linkage with the HIV registry, patient data were assigned a study code, individual identifiers were removed, and specimens were tested for HIV-1 antibody. Of 2,825 eligible patients, 155 (5.5%) were HIV-seropositive: 139 (90%) with known infection and 16 (10%) with previously undiagnosed infection. Of those with previously undiagnosed infection, eight (5%) were newly diagnosed during hospitalization and eight (5%) remained undetected following hospitalization. For HIV-seropositive patients, previously undiagnosed infection was significantly more common among those with no use of the health care system in the past year than those with recent outpatient or inpatient visits (41.7% versus 4.6%, odds ratio [OR] = 14.9, 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 4.7, 47.1). Despite a relatively high hospital HIV seroprevalence, the rate of undiagnosed infection was low, suggesting that the percentage of the HIV epidemic remaining ""undetected"" may be smaller in some settings than suggested by previous studies of hospitalized patients. Linkage of surveillance data to blinded seroprevalence studies can be of value in estimating this ""undetected"" percentage and in evaluating the potential yield of routine HIV testing programs.

15283,0.005,1.0000,"In a prospective study, the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was investigated among consecutive patients admitted to an academic, urban public hospital in Seattle. The study population was uniquely young, was predominantly male, and had high rates of homelessness, cigarette smoking, alcoholism, injection drug use, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Leading causes of CAP among HIV-negative patients were aspiration, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella species, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Among HIV-positive patients, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, S. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae were the most common etiologic agents. Severe CAP was associated with typical bacterial infections and aspiration pneumonia but not Legionella infection among HIV-negative patients and with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections among HIV-positive patients. These findings emphasize the need to tailor empirical antibiotic therapy according to local patient populations and individual risk factors and highlight the importance of recognizing underlying HIV infection in patients who are hospitalized with CAP."

Three individuals remained clinically and immunologically stable over a 5- to 8-year period, three demonstrated precipitous and two gradual declines in CD4+ T lymphocytes. Viral load in PBMCs was quantitated by limiting dilution culture and DNA PCR, while minimally passaged viral isolates were studied for their ability to induce syncytium formation in vitro and, when relevant, sensitivity to zidovudine (ZDV). Viral burden remained relatively low in those who remained clinically and immunologically stable, while increasing substantially in all five individuals who experienced a decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes. Two subjects were noted to have a switch from non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) to syncytium-inducing (SI) isolates immediately preceding a precipitous decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes, while the third individual who experienced such a decline and the two who had gradual declines did not develop SI isolates. Moreover, of the three subjects who experienced a decrease in CD4+ T lymphocyte number and were given ZDV during the study period, none were noted to develop resistance to this agent. In summary, the virology in clinically and immunologically stable individuals was characterized by relatively low viral burden in PBMCs and a predominance of NSI isolates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

17613,0.005,1.0000,"Anemia, the most common hematological disorder in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is associated with decreased quality of life and survival. Hypogonadism is prevalent in advanced HIV disease, however, low testosterone levels have not been customarily implicated in HIV-associated anemia. This study was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between testosterone levels and androgen use with anemia in HIV, and to characterize other clinical correlates of HIV-associated anemia. This was a cross-sectional, observational study of 200 HIV-positive patients at a public hospital HIV clinic from July 2000 to August 2001. A written questionnaire detailed previous and current medication use, opportunistic infections, and malignancies. Hematological and virological parameters, testosterone, and erythropoietin levels were measured; CD4(+) T lymphocyte count and viral load nadir and peak levels were obtained from the computerized medical record. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin <13.5 g/dl in men and <11.6 g/dl in women. Twenty-four percent of women and 28% of men were anemic. Anemia was associated with lymphopenia (adjusted OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.36-11.80), high erythropoietin levels (adjusted OR 7.73, 95% CI 2.92-20.48), and low testosterone levels (adjusted OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.01-10.60). Anemia was negatively associated with female sex (adjusted OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.85), current antiretroviral therapy (adjusted OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20-0.95), current androgen use (adjusted OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.84), and macrocytosis (adjusted OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.61). Low testosterone levels may have a positive association and supplemental androgens a negative association with anemia in HIV disease."
18522,0.005,1.0000,"In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), hospitalization as a measure of morbidity has become of increasing interest. The objectives of this study were to determine clinical predictors of hospitalization among HIV-infected persons initiating HAART and to explore the impact of gender and drug use on hospitalization. The analysis was based on a cohort of HIV-positive individuals initiating HAART between 1996 and 2001. Information on hospitalizations was obtained through data linkage with the BC Ministry of Health. Cox-proportional hazard models were used to assess variables associated with time to hospitalization. A total of 1,605 people were eligible and 672 (42%) were hospitalized for one or more days. The final multivariate model indicated that there was an increased risk of hospitalization among those with high baseline HIV RNA (HR for > 100,000 copies/mL: 1.26; 95%CI: 1.16-1.59) or low CD4 cell counts (HR [95% CI] compared to > or = 200 cells/mm3: 1.62 [1.28-2.06] and 1.29 [1.07-1.56] for < 50 and 50-199 cells/mm(3), respectively). Other factors, including adherence, previous hospitalization, gender and injection drug use remained predictive of hospitalization. These findings highlight the importance of closely monitoring patients starting therapy with low CD4 cell counts in order to mediate or prevent outcomes requiring hospitalization."
17232,0.005,1.0000,"Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) develop immunologic dysfunction and multiorgan inflammatory diseases directly associated with HIV-1 infection. Of these inflammatory diseases, the most devastating to the HIV-infected patient is involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). The pathogenesis of the clinical syndrome observed in these patients, termed HIV-associated dementia, remains poorly understood. However, as most of the detectable virus in the CNS is in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage, it is clear that penetration of the blood-brain barrier by HIV-1 and the subsequent influx of monocytes into the brain are crucial components in the neuropathogenesis of HIV-associated dementia. Using the SIV-infected macaque model of acquired immunodeficiency disease, much has been learned about viral neuroinvasion occurring soon after experimental infection. The aim of this review is to discuss these recent advances and provide insight into plausible mechanisms for monocyte entry into the CNS."
7248,0.005,1.0000,"Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is an inflammatory neurologic disease caused by HTLV-1 infection, in which HTLV-1-infected CD4(+) T cells and HTLV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells may play a role in the disease pathogenesis. Patients with HAM/TSP have high proviral loads despite vigorous virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses; however, it is unknown whether the T cells are efficient in eliminating the virus in vivo. To define the dynamics of HTLV-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses, we investigated longitudinal alterations in HTLV-1 proviral load, amino acid changes in an immunodominant viral epitope, frequency of HTLV-1-specific T cells, and degeneracy of T-cell recognition in patients with HAM/TSP. We showed that the frequency and the degeneracy of the HTLV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells correlated well with proviral load in the longitudinal study. The proviral load was much higher in a patient with low degeneracy of HTLV-1-specific T cells compared to that in a patient with comparable frequency but higher degeneracy of the T cells. Furthermore, in a larger number of patients divided into 2 groups by the proviral load, those with high proviral load had lower degeneracy of T-cell recognition than those with low proviral load. Sequencing analysis revealed that epitope mutations were remarkably increased in a patient when the frequency and the degeneracy were at the lowest. These data suggest that HTLV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells with degenerate specificity are increased during viral replication and control the viral infection."
12918,0.005,1.0000,"Treated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is characterized by ectopic fat deposition, a persistent inflammatory state, and increased cardiometabolic risk. In this secondary analysis of a placebo controlled trial of rosuvastatin among 147 HIV+ subjects (median age 46; 78% men) on stable antiretroviral therapy, we aimed to evaluate longitudinal associations between computed tomography (CT) measures of pericardial fat (PCF) volume and density, insulin resistance, and inflammation. We measured PCF volume and density (mean attenuation in Hounsfield units) by noncontrast gated CT at baseline and week 96. Homeostatic model of insulin resistance was calculated from fasting insulin and glucose at entry, 24, 48, and 96 weeks. At baseline, insulin resistance correlated positively with PCF volume and negatively with density. Similarly divergent correlations of volume and density were observed with waist:hip ratio, nadir CD4+ count, and duration of antiretroviral therapy. In a linear mixed model, PCF density was associated with insulin resistance independent of PCF volume, body mass index, metabolic syndrome, and biomarkers of immune activation and systemic inflammation; however, baseline PCF measures were not associated with longitudinal changes in insulin resistance. Soluble CD163, a marker of monocyte activation, positively correlated with PCF volume and was associated with insulin resistance in linear models. Statin treatment assignment did not affect PCF volume or density change (both p > 0.8). In conclusion, the quantity and quality (i.e., radiodensity) of PCF are differentially related to insulin resistance and inflammation in patients with treated HIV infection."

In this study, we use CMV DNA to identify active infections, and levels of CMV-reactive antibody to assess the persistent burden of CMV in a longitudinal study of 78 young adult patients beginning ART in Jakarta, Indonesia, with <200 CD4 T cells/μL. CMV antibodies, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], soluble interferon-α/β receptor) and T cell phenotypes were assessed before ART (V0) and after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (V1-V12). CMV DNA was detected in 41 patients (52%) at V0, irrespective of CD4 T cell counts, gender, age, or plasma HIV RNA. CMV DNA+ patients had higher levels of antibody reactive with CMV Immediate Early 1 (IE-1) at V0 and V12 (p = 0.04), and with CMV lysate at V12 (p = 0.01). Detectable CMV DNA did not align with inflammatory markers, but associated with lower CD4/CD8 ratios until V3. CMV antibody levels correlated inversely with proportions of naive CD4 and CD8 T cells, and directly with proportions of CD57"
4212,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis E is an inflammatory liver disease caused by infection with the hepatitis E virus (HEV). In tropical regions, HEV is highly endemic and predominantly mediated by HEV genotypes 1 and 2 with >3 million symptomatic cases per year and around 70 000 deaths. In Europe and America, the zoonotic HEV genotypes 3 and 4 have been reported with continues increasing new infections per year. So far, little is known about T-cell responses during acute HEV genotype 3 infection. Therefore, we did a comprehensive study investigating HEV-specific T-cell responses using genotypes 3- and 1-specific overlapping peptides. Additional cytokines and chemokines were measured in the plasma. In four patients, longitudinal studies were performed. Broad functional HEV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses were detectable in patients acutely infected with HEV genotype 3. Elevated of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels during acute HEV infection correlated with ALT levels. Memory HEV-specific T-cell responses were detectable up to >1.5 years upon infection. Importantly, cross-genotype HEV-specific T-cell responses (between genotypes 1 and 3) were measurable in all investigated patients. In conclusion, we could show for the first time HEV-specific T-cell responses during and after acute HEV genotype 3 infection. Our data of cross-genotype HEV-specific T-cell responses might suggest a potential role in cross-genotype-specific protection between HEV genotypes 1 and 3. "
10959,0.005,1.0000,"Nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase-gamma inhibition and subsequent mtDNA depletion. Effects on mtDNA mutation, although suggested by critical involvement of polymerase-gamma in DNA-repair reactions, are unknown. In the present study, we assessed the nature and frequency of mitochondrial genome sequence differences in peripheral-blood samples taken prior to NRTI therapy and after 6-77 mo of treatment in 16 NRTI-treated patients. Samples from 10 HIV-infected, treatment-naive control individuals were taken at similar time intervals. Single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA-sequencing analysis techniques were used to detect mitochondrial genome sequence variants between paired longitudinal samples, and heteroplasmic populations were quantified after cloning and repeat SSCP/sequencing. Of 16 individuals treated with NRTIs, 5 exhibited altered SSCP profiles associated with the development of novel heteroplasmic DNA sequence changes, whereas no SSCP pattern change within these regions was observed in the control individuals. Heteroplasmic sequence changes were distributed across four regions of the genome: the noncoding region to 12S ribosomal RNA, reduced-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide dehydrogenase 1, and cytochrome oxidase subunits I and III. Of the total of 26 patients who were examined in the present study, 4 of 5 patients with detectable mtDNA sequence changes since commencement of therapy developed evidence of peripheral fat wasting (lipoatrophy) between sample intervals (P=.031). One patient, without detectable sequence changes on NRTI therapy, also developed lipoatrophy. Levels of mtDNA copies/cell in blood samples were determined by quantitative PCR for 11 of the 16 NRTI-exposed patients; 7 of these 11 patients showed reduced levels of mtDNA in blood after therapy, including all 3 patients tested with evidence of mtDNA sequence changes on therapy. These data indicate that NRTI therapy provides conditions permissive for the development of peripheral-blood mtDNA mutations in vivo."
5375,0.005,1.0000,"A high percentage of patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection presents with decreased tryptophan concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. In parallel degradation products of tryptophan like kynurenine and quinolinic acid are increased. We investigated the behavior of tryptophan concentrations in 14 patients with HIV infection before and during treatment with zidovudine, and we found a significant increase of tryptophan in serum and cerebrospinal fluid after 4-14 months of therapy. In parallel, neopterin concentrations decreased significantly. Moreover, an association existed in cerebrospinal fluid between the degree of tryptophan increase and neopterin decrease. Thus, treatment with zidovudine contributes to a gradual normalization of tryptophan metabolism in patients with HIV-1 infection. The data imply that zidovudine therapy is associated not only with a reduction of virus replication but also immune activation is reduced."
14088,0.005,1.0000,"Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) is a rare entity characterized by the infiltration of interstitial tissues and alveolar spaces by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and other lymphoreticular structures. The etiology of LIP is unknown, although associations with autoimmune and infectious factors have been described. The incidence of LIP has risen in recent years, mainly in children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), while remaining less common in the adult population. No agreement has been reached regarding the diagnostic tests necessary for a firm diagnosis although suspicion is usually based on clinical and radiographic findings, with confirmation provided by examination of histological samples. The most common treatment is corticosteroids, either alone or in combination with other immunosuppressant agents although no evidence from controlled trials is available and cases have been reported in which LIP resolved in AIDS patients with antiretroviral therapy alone. We report the case of a human immunodeficiency virus-infected adult who was diagnosed with LIP by open lung biopsy and who responded to antiretroviral drugs with no need for associated corticosteroid therapy."
18089,0.005,1.0000,"The rate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression or death of individuals coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is conflicting. The complete-case analysis systematically used, excludes patients unscreened for HCV. Our objective was to assess if rate of survival differed between HIV-infected patients screened and unscreened for HCV in a hospital-based prospective cohort study. Patients were enrolled in the Lyon section of the French Hospital Database on HIV between 1 July 1992 and 31 May 2005. A multivariate Cox regression model was used to analyse the association of HCV screening with survival. Of 3244 patients, 299 (9.2%) were not screened for HCV. The populations screened and unscreened differed by the proportion of acquired immune deficiency syndrome at baseline, presumed route of infection, CD4 cell count category at baseline, mean duration of follow-up, mean number of visits per year, type of antiretroviral therapy and survival. The rate of progression to death was higher for non-HCV-screened vs HCV-screened patients: the incidence rate among HCV-screened patients was 22.9/1000 patient-years; the incidence rate among HCV-unscreened patients was 52.4/1000 patient-years. The adjusted hazards ratio of death was 2.48 [95% confidence interval (1.83-3.35); P < 0.001] for patients with unknown HCV status compared with others. In conclusion, unscreened or unknown HCV status was associated with an increased risk of death in our hospital cohort. Important prognostic factors are related to, or confounded by the practice of HCV screening."

VZV DNA was detected in CSF of 13 (2.5%) of 514 patients. Four of 13 patients had VZV encephalitis or meningoencephalomyelitis. These four patients received intravenous acyclovir therapy; CSF became negative for VZV DNA and clinical conditions improved for two, whereas CSF remained positive for VZV DNA and clinical conditions worsened until death for two. In nine of 13 patients, the neurological symptoms were likely caused by other simultaneous HIV-related complications in the central nervous system. After intravenous therapy with high doses of acyclovir or foscarnet, VZV was cleared from CSF in eight of nine patients. VZV DNA can be detected in CSF of HIV-infected patients in association with either manifestations of neurological VZV disease or subclinical reactivation of VZV infection. Antiviral treatment may be effective in suppressing VZV replication in the nervous system."

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings were available in 17 cases, electrophysiology in all and a neuromuscular biopsy in 11. Of six otherwise asymptomatic HIV+ patients, five had chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and one acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP). CSF showed pleocytosis in all cases. Infiltration of the endoneurium and/or the epineurium by mononuclear cells was seen in biopsies from three cases. These six patients recovered either spontaneously, or with corticosteroids or plasmaphereses. Of five patients with AIDS related complex (ARC), three had distal predominantly sensory peripheral neuropathy (DSPN), one CIDP and one mixed neuropathy. Of 14 patients with AIDS, one had mononeuropathy multiplex and 13 painful DSPN. Electrophysiological studies were consistent with an axonopathy. Nerve biopsies in six cases showed axonal changes but surprisingly associated with marked segmental demyelination in two cases. Cell infiltration was present in nerve samples in two cases. Five patients died within six months after the onset of the neuropathy."
3509,0.005,1.0000,"Following a long-term decline, death rates in men 25-44 years of age increased from 212 deaths/100,000 in 1983 to 236 deaths/100,000 in 1987. To assess the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections on this trend and to identify causes that are increasing in association with the HIV epidemic, we analyzed national mortality statistics and compared death rates in states with high and low incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In 1987, there were 10,248 deaths with HIV infection, AIDS, or conditions in the AIDS surveillance definition assigned as the underlying cause, representing 11 percent of deaths for men in this age group compared to less than 1 percent in 1980. In addition, deaths with other underlying causes, such as other infections, drug abuse, and unknown/unspecified causes, had diverging and higher rates in states with high versus low AIDS incidence. In the absence of deaths due to HIV/AIDS and excess deaths due to these associated conditions, we estimate that death rates for men 25-44 years of age would have been 201-209/100,000 in 1987. For 1987, approximately 70-90 percent of HIV-related deaths were reported through national AIDS surveillance. The HIV epidemic has led to a reversal in mortality trends and to increases in various causes of death for young men."
18537,0.005,1.0000,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common infection which usually produces mild or no symptoms in immunocompetent individuals. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated immunosuppression it is most commonly associated with malignancy which usually occurs at very low CD4+ cell counts. We describe a newly diagnosed HIV-positive patient who presented with headaches and cerebellar signs. She was incorrectly diagnosed with cerebral tuberculosis (TB) infection based on the histology report from a cerebellar biopsy specimen. After extensive investigation including cerebrospinal fluid sampling and reanalysis of the brain biopsy specimens she was found to have EBV-associated cerebral vasculitis and encephalitis and was successfully treated with valganciclovir and steroids. Whilst there are a few reports of EBV-associated encephalitis, cerebral vasculitis secondary to EBV in the context of HIV infection has not previously been described in the literature. "

Sera from positive pools were retested individually by three different enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and considered positive if reactive by all three assays. Only the sera with discordant EIA results were retested by Western blot. Of a total of 22,590 sera, 278 were HIV positive (1.2%). The highest rates were seen in hospitals located in metropolitan areas (1.5%), in infectious disease departments (28%) and in drug addiction treatment units (28%); among men aged 21-30 (4.6%) and 31-40 years (4%); and among women aged 21-30 years (1.6%). The distribution of seropositive patients by gender and age group suggests an increasing role of heterosexual transmissions of the infection. The presence of anti-HIV antibodies in sera from patients of both sexes, in all age groups, and from all clinical settings reinforces the need for health care workers to adhere to universal precautions issued to prevent occupational bloodborne infections."
8193,0.005,1.0000,"Increased cardiovascular risk has been linked to HIV infection and combination antiretroviral therapy, but the impact of hepatitis C virus (HCV) status on indices of cardiovascular risk has not been routinely assessed in the HIV-infected population. The objective of this study was to analyze associations of HCV, HIV, and combination antiretroviral therapy with lipid levels and C-reactive protein (CRP) among older men. We measured fasting total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride, and high-sensitivity CRP serum levels in a cross-sectional study of 108 HIV-infected and 74 HIV-uninfected at-risk older men. One hundred ten men (60%) had detectable HCV RNA, with no difference by HIV status (p = 0.25). The majority (88%) of men with HCV infection had a history of injection drug use. Among all men, HCV infection was independently associated with lower total cholesterol (p < 0.001), LDL-C (p < 0.001), triglycerides (p = 0.01), and CRP (p = 0.001). Among HIV-infected men, HCV infection was associated with lower total cholesterol (p < 0.001), LDL-C (p < 0.001), and CRP (p = 0.004). HCV infection was associated with lower triglycerides among men on protease inhibitors (PI) (p = 0.02) and non-PI combination antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.02), but not among antiretroviral-naïve men. These findings demonstrate an association of lower serum lipid and CRP levels with HCV infection and suggest that HCV status should be assessed as an important correlate of cardiovascular risk factors in studies of older men with or at risk for HIV."

Study participants were voluntary individuals 18 years of age or older recruited from AIDS Center VCT unit in Tbilisi, Georgia. Eligibility criteria of participants were: HIV positive result confirmed by western blot; age; and voluntary participation. Total 175 patients undergo interview with specially designed questionnaires. Most of the participants were male (71.4%), age range of HIV positives varied from 20 to 77 years old. Prevalence of HCV among HIV positive patients is high. Almost half (48.57%) HIV positive patients are co-infected with HCV. Men were more likely than women co-infected with HCV (60.80% and 18% accordingly). Major risk factor of male co-infection was related to drug use, needle and injection equipment sharing. Prevalence of HCV among injecting drug users was (73.40%). Drug users had 3.25 times more risk (PR 3.25; 95%CI; CL--1.89-5.26; p<0.01) to be infected with HCV compare non IDUs. Prevalence of being infected with HBV (Anti-HBc) among HIV positives was 43.42% (76/175) and the prevalence of Chronic HBV (HBsAg positive) was 6.86% (12/175). Prevalence rate of HBsAg among IDUs was 8.51% and among non IDU participants 5.26%. Triple infection (HIV, Hepatitis C and chronic form of Hepatitis B--HBsAg) was among 9 patients (5.14%). Infections were associated with injection drug use (88.88%) and mostly were related to share of needles/syringes and other injecting medical equipment. Transmission of HBV and HCV by sexual contact was not observed among those 9 participants. High risk behavior among HIV positive participants mostly related to drug use and unprotected sex with non regular partners. Other risk factors for Hepatitis transmission were associated with invasive medical manipulations, blood transfusion, surgery, abortions and etc. None of cases of HIV, or Hepatitis (B, C) transmission through medical manipulations can be documentary proved based on those research data."

We applied this methodology to the analysis of data from a cohort of 3,027 patients enrolled from a hospital-based surveillance system of HIV infection in the Bordeaux University Hospital and four secondary public hospitals in southwestern France. A total of 998 individuals (33%) progressed to AIDS during a median follow-up period of 34 months. Based on a progressive three-state Markov model, the estimated mean and median incubation periods were 9.1 years [95% confidence interval (CI) = 8.7-9.6] and 7.5 years (95% CI = 7.2-7.9), respectively. Our analyses showed a similar disease progression in men and women; we observed a more rapid progression for older subjects compared with younger ones and for homosexual men compared with heterosexuals, intravenous drug users, and transfusion recipients, who had similar disease progression rates after adjusting for age. The use of antiretroviral therapy appeared to slow disease progression. Moreover, the results indicated that a combination therapy of zidovudine with another antiretroviral drug may be more efficient than zidovudine monotherapy."
3755,0.005,1.0000,"The role of zidovudine and other antiretroviral agents in the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphomas has been somewhat controversial. In an attempt to elucidate the precise role of antiretroviral agents in the subsequent development of AIDS-related lymphoma, we performed a population-based, case-control study of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive patients with intermediate- or high-grade lymphoma in Los Angeles County, California, in which information regarding use of antiretroviral medications was ascertained. Diagnostic biopsy material was reviewed to confirm intermediate-or high-grade lymphoma. A structured interview, conducted with all cases and controls, included information about use of zidovudine and other antiretroviral agents. A total of 112 HIV-infected homosexual/bisexual men with lymphoma were matched to 112 homosexual/bisexual men with asymptomatic HIV infection; 49 of the lymphoma cases were also matched to 49 additional controls with AIDS, as defined by conditions other than lymphoma. Positive histories of zidovudine use were reported by 44 (39%) lymphoma cases, 24 (21%) asymptomatic HIV controls, and 21 (42%) AIDS controls. The average duration of zidovudine use up to 12 months before lymphoma diagnosis was 19.0 +/- 13.0 months (mean +/- SD) for the lymphoma cases, 12.6 +/- 10.5 months for the asymptomatic controls, and 11.0 +/- 7.1 months for the AIDS controls. When comparing the 49 HIV-positive lymphoma cases with their 49 matched AIDS controls, all of whom were diagnosed with AIDS during the same time period, the matched relative odds of lymphoma associated with prior use of zidovudine was 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.17 to 1.12). In comparing all 112 lymphoma cases with 49 AIDS controls, the unmatched relative odds of lymphoma associated with zidovudine use was 0.93 (95% confidence interval = 0.47 to 1.83). One lymphoma case and no AIDS control cases had a history of didanosine use; no lymphoma case or AIDS control cases had taken zalcitabine. We conclude that zidovudine is not associated with an increased risk of development of lymphoma among HIV-infected homosexual or bisexual men."

HCV RNA was found in sera from 27 of these 28 anti-HCV-positive patients. However, 8 dialysis patients had detectable levels of HCV RNA but were anti-HCV-negative with second-generation ELISAs. Among the 35 HCV-infected dialysis patients 16 were positive, 7 indeterminate, and 12 negative with the second-generation RIBA. More than 60% of patients with evidence of ongoing liver disease had HCV infection. Thus, current commercially available antibody tests did not accurately reflect the HCV status in dialysis patients.

In this study, 142 persons with HIV infection were administered the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). High levels of depression were predicted by lower perceived social support, attributions that health was influenced more by chance, high-risk sexual behavior practices, and greater number of HIV illness symptoms and greater duration of time knowing of one's own positive serostatus. Ongoing high-risk sexual behavior practices were predicted by higher levels of recreational drug use and of depression.

Of 960 patients with paired serum samples, 35 were HCV positive in both rounds, and 9 HCV-positive cases were newly identified in the second round. The incidence of HCV infection was 0.5 per 100 dialysis years. Phylogenetic analysis revealed clustered sequences that indicated nosocomial transmission. Sixty percent of HCV infections, however, can be attributed to 4 interdependent risk factors (i.e., hemodialysis before 1992, kidney transplantation before 1994, and birth or dialysis in a foreign country). In conclusion, the prevalence of HCV infections in The Netherlands does not decline, and transmission within dialysis units continues. Adequate screening of HCV infections and strict enforcement of universal infection control practices are required."
9157,0.005,1.0000,"There are no data concerning the genotypic analysis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Brazilian dialysis centers. Serum samples from all hemodialysis patients (n = 282) in Goiânia City, Central Brazil, were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). An overall prevalence of 12.0% was found, ranging from 0 to 33.3% depending on dialysis centers. Positive samples (n = 34) were submitted to serological subtyping by monoclonal ELISA and HBV DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among 30 PCR-positive samples, 26 were genotyped by use of the line probe assay technology (INNO-LiPA HBV, Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium). HBV genotypes A (50. 0%) and D (46.2%) were the most frequently found whereas genotype F (3.8%) was rare in this population. Serological subtypes adw2 (44. 1%) and ayw3 (41.2%) were dominant. By contrast, adw4 and ayw2 were found at a low frequency (2.9%). A correlation was observed in the distribution of genotypes and subtypes by dialysis center. Genotype D and subtype ayw3 were predominant in 2 hemodialysis centers whereas genotype A and subtype adw2 were predominant in the others. The findings of high HBsAg prevalence rates restricted to certain dialysis centers and the data obtained through genotyping and serological subtyping suggest HBV nosocomial transmission in these hemodialysis centers."
7931,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B has proved to be a major health hazard in hemodialysis patients. In order to investigate the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection profile in the hemodialysis population of Goiânia city--Central Brazil, all dialysis patients (N = 282) were studied. The prevalence of any HBV marker (HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc) was 56.7% (95% CI: 51.1-62.7), ranging from 33.3% to 77.7% depending on dialysis unit. HBV-DNA was detected in 67.6% and 88.2% of the HBsAg-positive serum samples, in 91.3% and 100% of the HBsAg/HBeAg-positive samples, and in 18.2% and 63.6% of the HBsAg/anti-HBe-reactive sera by hybridization and PCR, respectively. The length of time on hemodialysis was significantly associated with HBV seropositivity. Only 10% of the patients reported received hepatitis B vaccination. The findings of a high HBV infection prevalence in this population and the increased risk for HBV infection on long-term hemodialysis suggest the environmental transmission, emphasizing the urgent need to evaluate strategies of control and prevention followed in these units."
18119,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalences of chronic infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) and its genotypes vary among countries and ethnic groups. Among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and transplant recipients, the evolution of hepatic disease seems atypical and has not been established. In this study we compared the prevalence and HCV genotypic distribution among Brazilian patients with ESRD on dialysis or with transplantations. Moreover, we sought to compare the behavior of biochemical markers of hepatic activity of HCV infection in both groups. We prospectively evaluated 87 ESRD patients on dialysis and 105 transplant patients. Blood samples were obtained to perform qualitative HCV-RNA, genotyping, and, periodically, serum levels of aminotransferases (ALT, AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alpha-fetoprotein (AFT), and albumin. The prevalence of HCV in ESRD patients was similar to recipients (19.5% vs 25.7%; P = NS) and the most frequent genotype was 1a. There was no difference in the mean values of ALT, GGT, AFT, and serum albumin between both groups with HCV infection. The mean values of aminotransferases were slightly elevated and a high frequency of patients evolved with persistently normal parameters. In contrast, the mean values of the GGT were 3 or 4 times above the reference limit and a greater frequency of patients evolved with values persistently elevated in the 2 groups. In conclusion, in the 2 groups the prevalence of HCV infection was elevated; the most frequent genotype was 1a. Among the biochemical parameters, GGT seemed to be useful as an indirect marker of liver disease."
9669,0.005,1.0000,"It is unclear whether patients should be tested for the presence of HIV antibody. This test has taken upon itself a significance beyond a simple hemoglobin. Extreme views on testing are prevalent, both from the Centers for Disease Control, which does not recommend routine testing, to physicians advocating screening. The prevalence of HIV virus in our population undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis was investigated. Eighty-two patients ranging in age from 7-72 years were screened. There were seven positive results by both ELISA and Western Blot assays. Four had no risk factors, except for transfusion therapy before HIV screening. Three were known homosexuals. Only two of the HIV positive patients and three of the rest of the dialysis population had serologic markers for Hepatitis B infection. This 9% prevalence was much higher than expected. Although the data suggest that the risk to the health care worker is low, current recommendations to treat all patients as if they may be HIV positive protect the hospital or dialysis facility but may be unworkable. The health care workers attention is not focused because they do not differentiate between low and high risk patient groups. Furthermore, the number of patients who acquired the virus prior to routine screening is unknown. Because most dialysis patients were alive and transfused during this time period they may have inadvertently acquired the virus. If others share these findings, the implications for control of this disease are frightening, as the risk of transmission to patients' sexual partners is not inconsequential. I believe these findings support routine screening for HIV antibody."
4222,0.005,1.0000,"Sexual urges and needs do not cease merely upon the incarceration of an individual. They continue to exist in varying degrees in different individuals. This study looks into the sexual behaviour of all the male inmates of a detention facility in Singapore, both before and during their incarceration. In the advent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), high risk behaviours are investigated with the view to applying the results towards the formulation of policies on prevention of intraprison transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Taking masturbation as an expression of the degree of sexual needs, the three high risk groups for HIV infection--the promiscuous heterosexuals, the homosexuals/bisexuals and the intravenous drug users--had higher in-detention masturbation rates than the others. In addition, those incarcerated for 180 to 360 days up to the day of the study had higher masturbation rates than those incarcerated for less than 180 days and longer than 360 days. In-detention homosexual behaviour was also demonstrated in this study. Recommendations include health education programmes on AIDS and risk reduction and removal of the prohibition on masturbation. Mandatory HIV testing and segregation of high risk or HIV-positive inmates are not recommended."
8175,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate transmission of lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV)/human T lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) in long-term sexual partners, and the relationship between lymphadenopathy-associated virus seropositivity and transmission, nine couples (five heterosexual and four homosexual) at increased risk for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were studied. In two heterosexual couples, transmission of lymphadenopathy-associated virus from a seropositive man at increased risk to his monogamous wife occurred. In one couple, the wife of a man with hemophilia had lymphadenopathy-associated virus antibody and decreased T helper cells; in the other couple, the wife of a bisexual intravenous drug-user had AIDS. Neither woman had a recognized AIDS risk except marriage to a seropositive man at increased risk. However, study of the other couples revealed that regular sexual contact with seropositive persons over long periods did not always lead to evidence of lymphadenopathy-associated virus infection. This study suggests that presence of lymphadenopathy-associated virus antibody does not always indicate a high degree of infectivity."
15602,0.005,1.0000,"Between January 1, and October 31, 1987, 420 homosexual men who participated in a cohort study of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) completed a questionnaire that examined their sexual practices during the previous six months. Of the subjects, 205 (48.8%) men were HIV-seropositive and 215 (51.2%) men were HIV-seronegative. Although there was an appreciable level of condom usage in both groups, 13.5% of the HIV-seronegative men had engaged in unprotected receptive anal intercourse and 6.3% of the HIV-seropositive men had engaged in unprotected insertive anal intercourse. Condom breakage was reported on approximately 6% of occasions by a minority of subjects. Among subjects who were in a relationship with a regular male sexual partner, the most commonly reported sexual practices were deep kissing, mutual masturbation and receptive oral intercourse without ejaculation. No HIV-seronegative man engaged in unprotected receptive and/or insertive anal intercourse, receptive oral intercourse with ejaculation or receptive and/or insertive ""fisting"" with a regular partner who was HIV-seropositive. No HIV-seropositive man engaged in unprotected insertive anal intercourse to ejaculation with an HIV-seronegative partner, although they did so with partners who were HIV-seropositive or of unknown status. On multivariate analyses the subject's antibody status was found to be associated with receptive anal intercourse with a condom (P = 0.007) and mutual masturbation (P = 0.001), with HIV-seronegative men being more likely to practise either; no significant independent effect was associated with the partner's antibody status. These findings provide important information on the types and levels of sexual practices in a group of homosexual men after the recognition of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in this country."
15146,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this descriptive correlational study was to (1) examine differences in baccalaureate nursing students' attitudes toward persons living with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (PLWAs) according to mode of transmission and (2) identify demographic and academic variables influencing baccalaureate nursing students' attitudes toward PLWAs. Two hundred forty-six students from five geographically dispersed baccalaureate programs returned a completed demographic data sheet, AIDS Knowledge Scale, and AIDS Attitude Scale. The AIDS Attitude Scale, based on Goffman's theory of stigma, assesses stigmatizing attitudes, perceptions of deservedness of care, and attitudes of respect and regard for PLWAs according to five modes of human immunodeficiency virus transmission. The findings of this study demonstrated overall that baccalaureate students were the most stigmatizing toward persons who had developed AIDS through injecting drugs followed by sexual contact (both homosexual and heterosexual) and least stigmatizing toward PLWAs who contracted the virus through maternal transmission or a blood transfusion. Perhaps the PLWA who contracted AIDS through either maternal transmission or a blood transfusion was viewed as an ""innocent victim"" of the disease, whereas PLWAs who contracted the virus through either shared needles or sexual transmission were viewed as having acquired the infection through the results of their actions. The demographic characteristics of the respondents did not influence AIDS attitudes."
17732,0.005,1.0000,"We report here the extended Phase I testing of d-ala-Peptide-T-amide (Peptide T) in open trial. The drug was given intravenously in doses ranging from 0.1 to 3.2 mg/kg/day to 14 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex (ARC) patients for 12 weeks. Following a 4-week off-drug period, the first 6 patients finishing the intravenous testing were continued on intranasal drug, 25 mg/day, for 8 weeks. Control subjects were tested on the same neuropsychologic tests, but did not receive drug. Minimal evidence of toxicity was found. Performance increments in cognitive and neuromotor function were observed in patients with moderate neuropsychologic impairment compared with controls. Changes in constitutional symptoms included weight gain averaging 2 kg and reported improved sense of well-being. The latter findings were independent of variation in cognitive and neuromotor function. Measures of immunologic function and antiviral activity did not change significantly during the study. These data provide a scientific rationale for Phase II testing of Peptide T in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) patients focusing on neuropsychiatric outcome."

The present study was performed to verify if commercially available immunoassays, which are licensed for the screening of single serum and plasma samples, are suitable for the determination of HBsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV in plasma pools."
10001,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection is an important and frequent scenario, predominantly in injecting drug users (IDUs). The present study evaluated morbidity and mortality variation in HIV-infected patients with and without HCV co-infection. Co-infection prevalence was determined in 356 HIV-infected persons. Their clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, risk factors, HIV therapies, and mortality rates were evaluated. The prevalence of HCV was 54% in the overall group and 81% in IDUs, with a predominance of HCV genotype 1. Mortality rates were similar in patients with and without co-infection; however, co-infected patients had significantly higher liver damage as a cause of mortality when compared with those who were not co-infected. The high prevalence of HCV and an emerging mortality from liver diseases showed the significance of this co-infection in the HIV epidemic. Primary and secondary prevention are necessary to reduce the expanding impact of HCV infection in HIV patients."
2972,0.005,1.0000,"During the course of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) disease, the virus has been shown to effectively escape the immune response with the subsequent establishment of latent viral reservoirs in specific cell populations within the peripheral blood (PB) and associated lymphoid tissues, bone marrow (BM), brain, and potentially other end organs. HIV-1, along with hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV), are known to share similar routes of transmission, including intravenous drug use, blood transfusions, sexual intercourse, and perinatal exposure. Substance abuse, including the use of opioids and cocaine, is a significant risk factor for exposure to HIV-1 and the development of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, as well as HBV and HCV exposure, infection, and disease. Thus, coinfection with HIV-1 and HBV or HCV is common and may be impacted by chronic substance abuse during the course of disease. HIV- 1 impacts the natural course of HBV and HCV infection by accelerating the progression of HBV/HCV-associated liver disease toward end-stage cirrhosis and quantitative depletion of the CD4+ T-cell compartment. HBV or HCV coinfection with HIV-1 is also associated with increased mortality when compared to either infection alone. This review focuses on the impact of substance abuse and coinfection with HBV and HCV in the PB, BM, and brain on the HIV-1 pathogenic process as it relates to viral pathogenesis, disease progression, and the associated immune response during the course of this complex interplay. The impact of HIV-1 and substance abuse on hepatitis virus-induced disease is also a focal point."

Using polychotomous logistic regression, risk factor odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were determined for men with HIV alone, men with HBV alone, and men with both HIV and HBV, compared to seronegative men, and paired comparisons among these subgroups. Factors associated with the serologic prevalence of HIV alone and HBV alone (with respective ORs) included and receptive intercourse (HIV OR = 1.23; HBV OR = 1.12), history of gonorrhea (HIV OR = 4.58; HBV OR = 2.52), and rectal douching (HIV OR = 1.41; HBV OR = 1.20). Additional factors associated with HBV alone were years of homosexual activity (OR = 1.65), sexual activity with a person who developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (OR = 1.98), and lifetime number of male sex partners (OR = 1.25). HIV and HBV coprevalence was associated with anal receptive intercourse (OR = 1.36), history of gonorrhea (OR = 2.94), rectal douching (OR = 1.45), sexual activity with a person who developed AIDS (OR = 3.87), lifetime number of male sex partners (OR = 1.21), and the lifetime sum of sexually transmitted diseases (OR = 1.47). These findings reinforce the need for following safer-sex guidelines to prevent both infections and in the case of HBV, the prevention strategies should include vaccination."

The risk of HCV infection was 3.2-fold greater in HIV-1-infected infants compared with HIV-1-uninfected infants (17.1% of 41 vs. 5.4% of 112, P = .04). The median concentration of plasma HCV RNA was higher among the 13 mothers with HCV-infected infants (2.0 x 10(6) copies/mL) than among the 142 mothers with HCV-negative infants (3.5 x 10(5) copies/mL; P < .001), and there were no instances of HCV transmission from 40 mothers with HCV RNA concentrations of < 10(5) copies/mL.

The results of study could provide valuable arguments to support the discussion about the NAT implementation into the standards of blood donor´s testing in the Czech Republic. Two groups of samples were tested. In the first one, 5074 samples from consecutive blood donors, and in the second one, 5 repository preseroconverted samples from repeat blood donors, who were subsequently confirmed positive for Viral Hepatitis and/or HIV/AIDS by the National Reference Laboratory (NRL), were tested. One sample was found reactive by chemiluminescent microparticle immuno assay (CMIA) and nucleic acid test (NAT) (confirmed HBV-positive in NRL), 31 samples were CMIA-only reactive (15 anti-HCV, 4 HBsAg, 12 anti-HIV/p24, all confirmed negative in NRL) and one pool (6 samples) was found reactive (further individual NAT was negative for all samples) in the first group of samples. One sample was NAT-only reactive (confirmed HCV-positive in NRL) in the second group of samples. Our study confirmed that screening of infectious markers using NAT can reduce the risk of transmitting the monitored infections by blood transfusion in the Czech Republic, even as a country with currently good epidemiological situation."
15156,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of three variables--protease inhibitors, stavudine, and the length of combined therapy--on body habitus changes, metabolic effects and bone mineral density in HIV patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The onset of possible cardiovascular involvement was considered. Forty HIV patients (29 men and 11 women, mean age 39.13 +/- 7.82 years, range 28-61 years) treated with HAART for 12-43 months were evaluated for fat, lean, bone tissues, immunohematological and cardiovascular alterations. The differences in fat/lean tissues and bone mineral density were evaluated at dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Serum lipids and the CD4/CD8 T-cell counts were recorded. ECGs were taken every 6 months; color Doppler echocardiography and color Doppler ultrasounds of the carotid vessels were performed in close chronological sequence with the second DEXA. Statistical analyses included: Student's t-test, Wilcoxon test, and single-multiple regression analysis. Thirteen patients presented with fat loss, 7 fat accumulation, and 20 a combined form of both. The changes in the single body districts showed that the decrease in the limb fat is to be attributed to protease inhibitors, while none of the three variables was responsible for the decrease in the upper limb fat. The trunk weight increase was not significant. The decrease in the lean mass of the upper limbs is to be attributed to protease inhibitors, while none of the three variables was responsible for the increase in the lean mass of the upper and lower limbs. The decrease in bone mineral density was not significant. No treatment-related cardiovascular lesions were observed. In HIV patients treated with HAART for 12-43 months, the decrease in lower limb fat was due to protease inhibitors. Neither osteopenia nor cardiovascular diseases were observed during follow-up."
13183,0.005,1.0000,"Thalidomide therapy has been shown to cause increases in body weight in patients with HIV and tuberculosis infections. To examine the nature of this weight gain and its immunological correlates in patients with HIV infection, we studied a cohort of 13 patients with minimally symptomatic HIV disease. Patients were admitted to the Rockefeller University General Clinical Research Center and maintained on strict isocaloric diets to achieve weight stabilization before a 14-day course of thalidomide treatment. Mean percentage weight increase was 3.6% on day 14 of thalidomide therapy (p = 0.002). Weight gain was associated with a reduction in mean daily urinary nitrogen excretion of 1.81 g (p = 0.017). Resting energy expenditure was unaffected by thalidomide. Body composition analysis suggested some extracellular fluid retention in the first week of thalidomide therapy, followed by an expansion of lean tissue mass during the second week. Remarkably, total lymphocyte counts and CD8+ T cell counts increased following treatment with the drug from 1578 +/- 185 to 2617 +/- 265 and from 938 +/- 146 to 1369 +/- 231, respectively. Modest increases in CD4+ T cell counts were also observed. Levels of circulating TNF-alpha were not elevated at baseline. A significant increase in mean plasma levels of soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2r), from 1918 +/- 250 to 3816 +/- 411 pg/ml (p = 0.0022), occurred in response to thalidomide, suggesting drug-induced immunological activation. In conclusion, thalidomide treatment of patients with HIV infection caused weight gain and lean tissue anabolism, even when caloric intake was kept constant. The nature of the association between thalidomide treatment-induced metabolic changes and the immunomodulatory effects of the drug has yet to be elucidated."
14379,0.005,1.0000,"We obtained data from 111 gay men who entered a longitudinal study of the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) without clinical evidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and examined them regularly over a 36-month period. Using a Cox proportional-hazard regression model to compare cumulative risk of mortality in subjects with and without cognitive impairment and several putative risk factors present at baseline, we found that the mortality risk ratio (RR) associated with poor neuropsychologic test performance was significantly increased (RR = 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 7.8), and increased further (RR = 4.1; 95% CI, 1.3 to 12.5) when adjusted for other factors associated with mortality (a history of a disturbance in movement or gait, CD4-lymphocyte and red blood-cell counts, and age). A significant increase in symptoms related to cognitive impairment and gait, a decline in neuropsychologic test performance, and declines in CD4-lymphocyte and red-cell counts occurred over the study period. A second model was constructed to adjust for changes in CD4-lymphocyte and red-cell counts, age, medical stage, and motor symptoms over the study period, but the mortality RR for poor neuropsychologic test performance at baseline changed very little (RR = 4.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 14.9). We conclude that the presence of cognitive impairment, manifest by poor neuropsychologic test performance in both asymptomatic and symptomatic gay men with HIV infection, is associated with a significantly increased risk of death. This effect progresses in parallel with the immunologic and systemic effects of HIV."
4156,0.005,1.0000,"Undernutrition is a frequent complication of evolutive and chronic HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection characterized by bodyweight loss and changes in body composition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define AIDS wasting as involuntary loss of more than 10% of body weight, plus more than 30 days of either diarrhea, or weakness and fever. Wasting syndrome has been considered as a case definition of the AIDS disease since 1987. Wasting syndrome is clearly linked to disease progression and death. Despite the progress under the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), wasting is still a problem for people with AIDS. A small part of the weight lost is fat. More important is the loss of ""lean body mass"", which is mostly muscle. Body composition changes during HIV infection are different from those observed in food deprivation. Under the era of HAART, a HIV-associated adipose redistribution syndrome (HARS) was described that associates subcutaneous lipoatrophy and abdominal obesity linked to various metabolic disorders. Several factors contribute to wasting syndrome. Not only low food intake and poor nutrient absorption, but mainly altered metabolism (increased resting energy expenditure) and specific disturbances in protein turnover, which is also increased. Nutritional evaluation of HIV-infected patients should include the measurement of body composition and analysis of nutritional parameters, including albumin, transthyretin and C-reactive protein. Transthyretin seems to be particularly useful to follow the recovery period of malnutrition."
2756,0.005,1.0000,"The potential impact of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) on clinical, immunological and virological responses to initial highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is important to evaluate due to the high prevalence of HIV-HCV coinfection. A historical cohort study was conducted among 824 HIV-infected patients starting HAART at a public referral service in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to assess the impact of HCV seropositivity on appearance of a new AIDS-defining opportunistic illness, AIDS-related death, suppression of viral load, and an increase in CD4-cell count. A total of 76 patients (9.2%) had a positive HCV test, 26 of whom (34.2%) had a history of intravenous drug use. In multivariate analysis, HCV seropositivity was associated with a smaller CD4-cell recovery (RH=0.68; 95% CI [0.49-0.92], but not with progression to a new AIDS-defining opportunistic illness or to AIDS-related death (RH=1.08; 95% CI [0.66-1.77]), nor to suppression of HIV-1 viral load (RH=0.81; 95% CI [0.56-1.17]) after starting HAART. These results indicate that although associated with a blunted CD4-cell recovery, HCV coinfection did not affect the morbidity or mortality related to AIDS or the virological response to initial HAART."
10311,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated myocarditis is well reported. Many of these patients are also intravenous (IV) drug abusers. This study examined sudden death victims from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, State of Maryland, for active myocarditis. A group of HIV-negative drug abusers is compared with a group of HIV-negative victims without any known risk factors for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Using modified Dallas criteria combined with an avidin-biotin-labeled immunoperoxidase procedure, the cases were classified as active, borderline, or absent myocarditis. Serologic analysis for circulating antimyocardial antibody was performed along with phenotypic analysis of the infiltrate. Of the 15 IV drug abuse cases examined, none were positive for HIV (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot). With IV drug abuse as the primary risk factor, five cases demonstrated active myocarditis, while five others had borderline myocarditis. Only one of 10 low-risk patients had a lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with borderline myocarditis. Drug abuse-related myocarditis was associated with cardiac pathology resulting in sudden death in only one case. Antimyocardial antibodies were positive in four of the 15 IV drug abuse cases, including patients with active, borderline, and absent myocarditis. The phenotypic expression of the lymphocytic infiltrates was similar to the findings reported for idiopathic and HIV-related myocarditis (Am J Pathol 137:1365-1371, 1990). Toxicology studies did not implicate any particular drug of abuse, but the increased frequency of myocarditis observed may reflect complications of cocaine or the combined effects of opiates and cocaine. Intravenous drug abuse is an independent risk factor for myocarditis and must be taken into consideration in studies of HIV-associated myocarditis."

In 90 clinical sites providing HIV care and treatment, representing a cohort of 82,000 patients in 2010, the underlying causes of death and characteristics of deceased patients were prospectively recorded in 2000, 2005, and 2010 by using a standardized form. We provide data on PIVS, define as patients with a CD4+ T cell value above 500/mm3 and a plasma HIV-1 RNA below 50 copies/ml at their last periodic checkup before death, compare them with immunovirologic uncontrolled patients, and describe trends in these data from 2000 onward. The main underlying causes of death of the 120 PIVS recorded in 2010 were: a non-AIDS/nonviral hepatitis-related malignancy (19%), suicide (12.5%), cardiovascular disease (11.5%), and liver disease (11%). Only three PIVS died of an AIDS-related event. Socioeconomic difficulty was identified in 41% of PIVS in 2010. This percentage had constantly grown since 2000 (p < .001). Median age at death also increased (40, 46, and 52 years in 2000, 2005, and 2010, respectively; p < .001). The distribution of the main causes of death of PIVS was statistically different from that of uncontrolled patients (p < .001). Although immunovirologic control is fundamental, a parallel multidisciplinary approach to care is essential to accurately detect and treat comorbidities, particularly cancer, psychiatric disorders, and cardiovascular disease. Psychosocial aspects must be considered."

Relative risk of death (RR) was 2.1 if the baseline RNA level was >100,000 copies/mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-3.0) and was 3.0 if the baseline CD4 cell percent was <15% (95% CI, 2.2-4.0). If RNA levels increased after baseline, the RR was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3-2.6), and if the CD4 cell percent dropped to <15%, the RR was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.6-4.9). In a multivariate model, both baseline RNA level and CD4 cell percent were independently associated with mortality risk. In a time-dependent model, the RR per log10 increase in HIV-1 RNA copy numbers was 2.8 (95% CI, 2.1-3.6) and per 5 percentage point decrement in CD4 cell percent was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.2-1.5). Both variables should be considered for in decision-making regarding therapy and evaluation of antiretroviral response."
16757,0.005,1.0000,"Health care workers have expressed concern regarding the risk of infection from patients with AIDS. Much less attention is given to the possibility of exposure to patients infected with the hepatitis B virus. This article reviews the data on the probability of exposure to HIV or hepatitis B and subsequent seroconversion, as well as the mortality and morbidity rates associated with both viruses. A decision-analytic analysis of the occupational risk for HIV and hepatitis B is also presented. This model indicates that quality-adjusted loss in life expectancy is greater after percutaneous exposure to a patient who is seropositive for the hepatitis B e antigen than after exposure to a patient with symptomatic HIV infection."
13155,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection risk behavior was evaluated in a cross-sectional survey of 400 male active-duty US Army personnel who presented at a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic with symptoms of acute urethritis. High-risk partners were common, and nearly one-quarter of the sample had previously had STDs. Logistic regression models examined correlates of HIV exposure risk, of inconsistent condom use, and of having partners with increased risk of HIV infection. Frequent partner turnover, sex ""binging,"" negative attitudes toward condom use, and engaging in sex during military leaves were important correlates of risk. Individuals with HIV infection risk behavior generally were cognizant of their risk for HIV infection. Implications for intervention are discussed."
18239,0.005,1.0000,"A serologic survey of 4863 patients attending two inner-city sexually transmitted disease clinics was conducted in 1988 1 year after an initial survey to reassess the prevalence and associated risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The HIV seroprevalence rates had not changed significantly (5.2% in 1987, 4.9% in 1988), and remained higher among men (5.6%) than among women (3.6%). The HIV seroprevalence increased steadily with age, to 34 years in women and to 39 years in men. Of patients with a reactive syphilis serologic test result, 24.3% were HIV infected compared with 3.5% of patients with a nonreactive test for syphilis. In multivariate analysis, a reactive serologic test for syphilis was significantly associated with HIV infection in all major risk behavior categories. Among heterosexuals who denied parenteral drug abuse, HIV infection rates were 6.8 and 8.7 times greater for women and men, respectively, who had a reactive serologic test for syphilis. Evidence of heterosexual transmission of HIV was further suggested by a change in HIV seroprevalence in women from 3.0% in 1987 to 3.6% in 1988, a male to female HIV infection ratio of 1.6, and 3.0% prevalence of infection among patients who denied established risk factors. This was most evident among those younger than 25 years, in whom 72% of infected women and 46.2% of infected men denied high-risk behaviors. These data demonstrate the strong association between syphilis and HIV infection and the importance of heterosexual HIV transmission in patients attending sexually transmitted disease clinics. This study underscores the need for a more comprehensive control program for sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis and HIV infection."
6452,0.005,1.0000,"We conducted a questionnaire and seroprevalence survey to determine the frequency and type of occupational exposures (OEs) and the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection experienced by public safety workers (PSWs). Of the 2910 PSWs who completed the survey, 6.8% reported at least one OE in the previous 6 months, including needlestick (1.0%), being cut with a contaminated object (2.8%), mucous membrance exposure to blood (0.9%), and being bitten by a human (3.5%). The rate of OE varied by occupation with 2.7% of firefighters, 3.2% of sheriff officers, 6.6% of corrections officers, and 7.4% of police officers reporting > or = 1 OE (P < 0.001). The HBV infection prevalence was 8.6%, and after adjustment for age and race, it was comparable to the overall US prevalence and did not vary by occupation. By multivariate analysis, HBV infection was not associated with any OEs, but it was associated with older age, being nonwhite, and a previous history of a sexually transmitted disease. This study demonstrated that although OEs are not uncommon among PSWs, HBV infection was more likely to be associated with nonoccupational risk factors. Administration of hepatitis B vaccine to PSWs early in their careers will prevent HBV infection associated with occupational and non-OEs."
9839,0.005,1.0000,"The development of novel compounds that can effectively inhibit both wild type and the most consensus resistant strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the primary focus in HIV disease management. Combination therapy, comprising at least three classes of drugs, has become the standard of care for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or HIV-infected individuals. The drug cocktail can comprise all three classes of HIV inhibitors, including nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI). Due to their competitive mode of inhibition and requirement for metabolic activation, almost all NRTI drugs lack the virological potency of NNRTI or PI drugs. However, data from clinical trials indicate that sustained viral suppression could not be achieved with NRTI, NNRTI or PIs alone. Therefore, the NRTIs will remain essential components of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for the foreseeable future, because they enhance the virological potency of the regimen, they do not bind excessively to protein and most regimens are small pills/tablets given once a day. It has become apparent in recent years that the prolonged use of certain NRTIs exhibits adverse events as a class, limiting the length of time for which they can be safely used. Of major clinical concern is their association with the potentially fatal lactic acidaemia and hepatic steatosis. These class events, as well as individual drug effects, such as peripheral neuropathy, are linked to delayed mitochondrial destruction. In addition to toxicity, the development of resistance-conferring mutations against exposure to nucleoside analogs currently in use influences long-term therapeutic benefits. Of critical importance for the evaluation of new NRTIs are recent studies showing that the efficiency of discrimination or excision by pyrophosphorolysis in the presence of nucleotides of a given NRTI is a key determinant in the emergence of one or the other resistance pathway."
9180,0.005,1.0000,"To assess the possible role of sexually transmitted diseases as cofactors for the spread of AIDS, 248 adult patients were tested for the presence of antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and syphilis. The survey was conducted in a hospital at Kagondo, Kagera Region, Northwest Tanzania, Africa. Subjects were randomly chosen from the outpatient clinic to include those with and without sexually transmitted diseases, as well as AIDS/pre-AIDS patients. The data were univariately and multivariately analysed by linear logit models, including interactions of demographic parameters. The results obtained reveal a strong association between the presence of antibodies against HIV, syphilis and HBV, respectively. The HBV/HIV-correlation remained stable in the multivariate analysis including interactions of social parameters, in contrast to the syphilis/HIV-correlation. We assume that this reflects the lower virulence of HBV as compared to that of syphilis. The prevalence of anti-HBV antibodies seems to be a more reliable marker for high sexual activity than those against syphilis. The possibility that HBV and HIV act as cofactors for each other's transmission could not be ruled out."
2014,0.005,1.0000,"Respiratory viruses, particularly influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses, are ubiquitous pathogens among humans, especially among young children. However, relatively little is known about the impact of these common infections on individuals with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A review of the literature identifies three key areas that need further exploration. First, moderate-to-severe and even fatal lower respiratory viral illnesses in HIV-infected individuals have been reported. In general, the clinical presentation of these respiratory viral infections in persons with HIV infection is similar to their presentation in individuals without HIV infection. The major exception is the occurrence of fulminant, and often fatal, disseminated adenovirus infection in adults and children with HIV disease. Despite these reports, no information is available regarding the frequency of moderate-to-severe respiratory viral illnesses in individuals with HIV infection. Epidemiologic studies of respiratory viral illnesses in cohorts of HIV-infected adults and children are needed. Second, prolonged shedding of respiratory viruses for weeks and even months has been documented in HIV-infected adults and children. The frequency of prolonged shedding in this population has not been well defined, but data from a small newborn cohort study suggest that, at least for RSV, prolonged shedding is common. Prolonged respiratory viral shedding has implications for infection control in medical facilities where HIV-infected individuals are treated and in nursing homes, child care centers, and group foster homes that provide care for HIV-infected individuals. Therapies to help eliminate these chronic viral infections should be explored. Finally, indirect evidence suggests that respiratory viral infection may result in changes in HIV replication and, theoretically, HIV disease progression. Increased HIV-1 replication has been demonstrated in vitro in T lymphoma cells exposed to genetic material from adenovirus. Increased HIV replication in peripheral blood from adults following inactivated influenza vaccination has been reported. The impact of natural respiratory viral infection (and perhaps vaccination against these pathogens) on HIV replication and disease progression will be an important area of study."
17069,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are major health problems world-wide. As both viruses partially share routes of transmission, co-infection is common. This is especially the case in patients infected through intravenous drug use. It has been shown that HIV accelerates HCV progression to cirrhosis. The influence of HCV infection on the natural history of HIV disease remains highly controversial. It is also known that HCV co-infection increases the risk of hepatotoxicity of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). These considerations as well as the improved survival of HIV patients due to HAART leads to increasing numbers of patients undergoing assessment and treatment of HCV infection. HCV treatment should be considered in stable HIV disease. Recent data indicate that HCV treatment schedules should be similar in co-infected and HCV mono-infected individuals, with pegylated interferon combined with ribavirin. For all treatment regimens published, coinfected patients had a lower sustained viral response rate compared to HCV mono-infected patients. Similar predictive factors determine the success rate. The effect of prolonging therapy to 12 months in genotype 2/3 and to 18 months in early viral responders with genotypes 1/4 needs to be assessed in further studies."
14439,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among HIV-infected individuals is necessary to both individual and public health, and psychosocial problems have independently been associated with poor adherence. To date, studies have not systematically examined the effect of multiple, co-occurring psychosocial problems (i.e., ""syndemics"") on ART adherence. Participants included 333 HIV-infected individuals who completed a comprehensive baseline evaluation, as part of a clinical trial to evaluate an intervention to treat depression and optimize medication adherence. Participants completed self-report questionnaires, and trained clinicians completed semi-structured diagnostic interviews. ART non-adherence was objectively measured via an electronic pill cap (i.e., MEMS). As individuals reported a greater number of syndemic indicators, their odds of non-adherence increased. Co-occurring psychosocial problems have an additive effect on the risk for poor ART adherence. Future behavioral medicine interventions are needed that address these problems comprehensively, and/or the core mechanisms that they share. "
17677,0.005,1.0000,"In 2016, an estimated 1.5 million females aged 15-24 years were living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Eastern and Southern Africa, where the prevalence of HIV infection among adolescent girls and young women (3.4%) is more than double that for males in the same age range (1.6%) (1). Progress was assessed toward the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 2020 targets for adolescent girls and young women in sub-Saharan Africa (90% of those with HIV infection aware of their status, 90% of HIV-infected persons aware of their status on antiretroviral treatment [ART], and 90% of those on treatment virally suppressed [HIV viral load <1,000 HIV RNA copies/mL]) (2) using data from recent Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) surveys in seven countries. The national prevalence of HIV infection in adolescent girls and young women aged 15-24 years, the percentage who were aware of their status, and among those persons who were aware, the percentage who had achieved viral suppression were calculated. The target for viral suppression among all persons with HIV infection is 73% (the product of 90% x 90% x 90%). Among all seven countries, the prevalence of HIV infection among adolescent girls and young women was 3.6%; among those in this group, 46.3% reported being aware of their HIV-positive status, and 45.0% were virally suppressed. Sustained efforts by national HIV and public health programs to diagnose HIV infection in adolescent girls and young women as early as possible to ensure rapid initiation of ART should help achieve epidemic control among adolescent girls and young women."
17113,0.005,1.0000,"Local genital tract inflammation stimulates leukocyte activity and causes HIV shedding, potentially increasing HIV sexual infectiousness. Although there are available clinical markers for genital tract inflammation, such as urinary leukocyte esterase, none have yet been examined in relation to HIV sexual risk behaviours. We sought to examine the association between urinary leukocyte esterase and sexual practices. Sexually active men living with HIV and receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART, N = 290) provided urine specimens and completed behavioural health assessments. HIV RNA tests and CD4 cell counts were abstracted from medical records. Urine specimens were analysed for leukocyte esterase using a standard point-of-care dipstick test. Thirty-one (10.6%) participants tested positive for leukocyte esterase. Logistic regression models did not indicate differences between men with elevated and un-elevated leukocyte activity on demographic, health, recent sexually transmitted infection symptoms and diagnoses or substance use. However, men with elevated leukocyte activity indicated significantly greater sexual behaviour in the previous three months, including more recent unprotected sexual intercourse. A simple over-the-counter urine test may serve as an indicator of sexual HIV infectiousness to inform further evaluation and treatment of genital tract inflammation, as well as condom use decisions during times of increased genital tract inflammation.

12149,0.005,1.0000,"Oral lesions are important in the clinical spectrum of HIV/AIDS, arousing suspicion of acute seroconversion illness (aphthous ulceration and candidiasis), suggesting HIV infection in the undiagnosed individual (candidiasis, hairy leukoplakia, Kaposi's sarcoma, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis), indicating clinical disease progression and predicting development of AIDS (candidiasis, hairy leukoplakia), and marking immune suppression in HIV-infected individuals (candidiasis, hairy leukoplakia, necrotizing periodontal disease, Kaposi's sarcoma, long-standing herpes infection, major aphthous ulcers). In addition, oral lesions are included in staging systems for HIV disease progression and as entry criteria or endpoints in clinical trials of antiretroviral drugs. Recognition and management of these oral conditions is important for the health and quality of life of the individual with HIV/AIDS. In keeping with this, the U.S. Department of Health Services Clinical Practice Guideline for Evaluation and Management of Early HIV Infection includes recommendations that an oral examination, emphasizing oral mucosal surfaces, be conducted by the primary care provider at each visit, a dental examination by a dentist should be done at least two times a year, and patients should be informed of the importance of oral care and educated about common HIV-related oral lesions and associated symptoms."
7068,0.005,1.0000,"Encouraging HIV-positive people to disclose their serostatus to their main partner is considered as a key component of secondary prevention. The purpose of this study was to identify individual and structural factors associated with HIV serostatus disclosure to one's steady partner in Cameroon, a country which has implemented a large program for access to antiretroviral therapy. We used data from the cross-sectional, nationally representative survey, ANRS 12-116 EVAL (Evaluation du programme camerounais d'accès aux traitements antirétroviraux--Impact sur la prise en charge et les conditions de vie de la population infectée par le VIH), conducted between 2006 and 2007 among HIV-infected outpatients attending health care facilities. Among the 1673 HIV-positive individuals reporting a steady partner at the time of the survey (61% women), 85.4% (n = 1429) had disclosed their serostatus to them; 77% of the respondents were receiving antiretroviral therapy. Multivariate analysis based on multilevel modeling approaches showed that the following individual factors were associated with disclosure: living with one's steady partner, living with children, reporting systematic condom use or sexual abstinence with one's steady partner, being a woman who is not the head of the household, and finally having HIV-infected people among friends or relatives and not living below the poverty line. Structural factors associated with disclosure were as follows: attending national health facilities in the country's capital cities Yaoundé or Douala and having access to psychosocial or economical support interventions. These results strengthen the argument for the introduction or development of psychosocial interventions at all levels of organization in Cameroonian hospitals as an important component of public health policies for those living with HIV."
1818,0.005,1.0000,"Acute infection with HIV is symptomatic in approximately two thirds to three-fourths of patients. This stage is defined as primary HIV infection or acute HIV illness. The diagnosis is crucial for public health because counseling can be provided to reduce the risk of transmission and for individual because early antiretroviral treatment could improve the prognosis, slowing the rate of disease progression. Physicians should be aware of the broad clinical spectrum representative of primary HIV infection, which ranges from mild symptoms resembling classic mononucleosis infection to highly severe presentations. Progression to AIDS and to death has been associated with the severity of the acute HIV infection. Clinical trials with combined antiretroviral drugs are needed to identify the best drug combinations as well as the optimal duration of treatment."
14699,0.005,1.0000,"Public health field services for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have not adequately evolved to address the expanding scale of the STI problem, its concentration among men who have sex with men, the emergence of new communication technologies and the availability of antiretroviral therapy as a cornerstone of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention. Field services need to modernize. Modernization should seek to expand field services objectives beyond sex partner STI testing and treatment to include: HIV testing of persons with bacterial STI and their partners, including efforts to promote frequent HIV/STI testing; increased condom access; linkage and relinkage to HIV care and promotion of viral suppression; preexposure prophylaxis promotion; linkage to long-acting contraception; and referral for health insurance. Field services programs cannot advance these new objectives while simultaneously doing all of the work they have traditionally done. Modernization will require a willingness to reconsider some longstanding aspects of field services work, including the centrality of face-to-face interviews and field investigations. Health departments seeking to modernize will need to carefully assess their ongoing activities and reorganize to align the use of field services resources with program priorities. In some instances, this may require reorganization to allow the staff greater specialization and closer integration with surveillance activities. Adapting programs will require new staff training, improvements in data management systems, and a greater investment in monitoring and evaluation. Although modernization is likely to evolve over many years, the time to start is now."

Therefore concern has been expressed that operation might have an adverse effect on the immune status of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Four HIV-positive patients without symptoms of HIV disease underwent cardiac valve replacement in consequence of infective endocarditis. After up to 15 months postoperatively, 3 patients are alive and well without signs of progressive immunodeficiency or recurrent endocarditis. One patient died of recurrent endocarditis without evidence of HIV-related disease on autopsy. Cardiac operation does not seem to accelerate HIV-related immunodeficiency."
15902,0.005,1.0000,"The records of 74 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive patients who were treated for upper-extremity infections were retrospectively reviewed. Intravenous drug use was the most common risk factor for HIV infection as well as the most common cause of the infection necessitating admission. These patients were admitted a total of 97 times for the treatment of 89 different infections and underwent 120 surgical procedures. Twenty-six infections (29%) required more than 1 operation, and 11 (12%) resulted in amputation. Twenty-seven patients who met criteria for the diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were found to be no more likely than their HIV-seropositive counterparts to be readmitted for the same diagnosis, to be treated for more than 1 infection, or to require more than 1 operation or amputation to eradicate their infection.

16638,0.005,1.0000,"Simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) chimerae, after in vivo passage in monkeys, can induce acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-like illness and death. A monkey infected with the molecularly cloned, pathogenic SHIV-HXBc2P 3.2 exhibited multifocal granulomatous pneumonia as well as progressive neurological impairment characterized by tremors and pelvic limb weakness. SHIV-HXBc2P 3.2N was isolated from brain tissue explants and characterized. Viruses with the envelope glycoproteins of SHIV-HXBc2P 3.2N exhibited increased sensitivity to soluble CD4 and several neutralizing antibodies compared with viruses with the parental SHIV-HXBc2P 3.2 envelope glycoproteins. By contrast, viruses with SHIV-HXBc2P 3.2 and SHIV-HXBc2P 3.2N envelope glycoproteins were neutralized equivalently by 2G12 and 2F5 antibodies, which are rarely elicited in HIV-1-infected humans. A constellation of changes involving both gp120 and gp41 envelope glycoproteins was responsible for the difference in susceptibility to neutralization by most antibodies. Surprisingly, the gain of an N-linked glycosylation site in the gp41 ectodomain contributed greatly to neutralization sensitivity. Thus, the environment of the central nervous system, particularly in the context of immunodeficiency, allows the evolution of immunodeficiency viruses with greater susceptibility to neutralization by antibodies."
4506,0.005,1.0000,"There exist at least two major coreceptors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 entry into target cells, the CXCR-4 and CCR-5 chemokine receptors for T lymphocyte-tropic and macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1, respectively. Highly purified human CD34 cells derived from umbilical cord blood were shown not to express CD4, CXCR-4, and CCR-5 on their cell membranes, as analyzed by immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometric analyses. However, expression of these molecules was inducible when highly purified CD34 cells underwent proliferation and differentiation along myeloid cell lineages, in the presence of suitable cocktails of hematopoietic growth factors. HIV-1 infectivity studies showed that macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1 could efficiently infect differentiated CD34 cells. T lymphocyte-tropic strains could not infect CD34 cells before or after induction of receptors and coreceptors. These data suggest that HIV-1 infection of CD34 cells and their progeny depends on membrane expression of the critical CD4 receptor, as well as certain chemokine coreceptors."
1310,0.005,1.0000,"Natural alpha interferon (IFN-alpha)-producing cells (IPCs) are now recognized as identical to plasmacytoid dendritic cell (DC) precursors in human blood and are thought to play an important role in antiviral immunity. In the present study, we examined the susceptibility as well as the cellular responses of IPCs to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. HLA-DR(+) CD11c(-) lineage-negative cells (IPCs) were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by magnetic-bead separation and cell sorting. We substantiated that IPCs expressing the major HIV-1 coreceptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, are susceptible to infection of both T-cell-line-tropic NL4-3 and macrophage-tropic JR-CSF HIV-1 by quantification of HIV-1 p24 in the culture supernatants and by provirus integration assay using human conserved Alu-HIV-1 long terminal repeat PCR. To evaluate the cellular response of IPCs to HIV-1, we examined IFN-alpha production and their differentiation into DCs. After incubation with either NL4-3 or JR-CSF, IPCs produced a large amount of IFN-alpha and at the same time underwent morphological differentiation into DCs with upregulation of CD80 and CD86. Heat inactivation of the supernatants containing HIV-1 did not affect the IFN-alpha production and maturation, whereas removal of virions by ultracentrifugation completely nullified both biological effects, indicating that these cellular responses do not require actual HIV-1 infection but are elicited by interaction with HIV-1 virions or certain viral components. In conclusion, these data strongly suggest that IPC can directly recognize and respond to HIV-1 with IFN-alpha production, which is crucial for preventing progress of HIV-1 infection and occurrence of opportunistic infection."

During 1993-1995, 854 patients were tested for HTLV-I/II infection on entry into the clinic, of whom 25 were infected with HTLV-I and 35 with HTLV-II. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with coinfections were more likely to be black, aged over 35 years, and have a history of injection drug use. HIV-1/HTLV-I coinfections were associated with higher median CD8 counts on entry (p < 0.05), and HIV-1/HTLV-II coinfections were associated with higher median percent CD4 counts (p < 0.05) compared with patients infected with HIV only. Coinfection was not associated with an increased diagnosis of AIDS. These findings indicate that HIV-1/HTLV-I/II coinfections are frequently diagnosed and are associated with unique immune phenotypes. Given the lack of information regarding the influence of dual infection on clinical status, differentiation of HTLV-I from HTLV-II infections may be important in understanding the clinical significance of retroviral coinfections."
16348,0.005,1.0000,"Skin and soft tissue infection (SSTIs) due to Staphylococcus aureus, particularly community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), are common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected populations in the United States. Studies have differed as to the importance of epidemiological and immunological factors in this relationship, and have employed conflicting strategies for variable selection in multivariate analyses. Developments in causal inference methods in epidemiology have emerged in the last decade to clarify relationships between variables and identify appropriate variables to include in and exclude from multivariate analysis. In this paper, we develop a causal diagram to clarify the pathways linking CA-MRSA and HIV. We focus on the role played by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis, prescribed to many severely immunocompromised HIV patients and potentially protective against SSTIs, which both mediates and moderates the relationship between immunological parameters and SSTI risk. We demonstrate, using simulated data, that statistical models may yield biased results if they do not account for how HIV viral load may also be a marker of adherence to TMP-SMX prophylaxis. We conclude with a proposed causal model that includes both the epidemiological as well as immunological factors that may explain the increased risk of initial and recurrent SSTI risk in HIV-infected populations."
4841,0.005,1.0000,"The antiviral response of CD8 T cells involves the differentiation of naive T cells into distinct types of effector and memory cells, which may be distinguished by the level of CD7 expression. We have investigated CD8 T cells in adults and children infected with HIV-1 to determine the disease relevance of cell subsets defined by CD7. CD8 T cells from patients infected with HIV-1 displayed profound down-modulation of CD7 expression as compared with healthy subjects, with expansion of both CD7(low) and CD7(negative) effector subsets. Loss of CD7(high) cells correlated directly with HIV-1 load and was particularly pronounced in patients with rapid disease progression. CD8 T cells specific for HIV-1, as well as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were predominantly found in the CD7(low) effector cell subset. Furthermore, recovery of CD4 counts on antiretroviral therapy was associated with reversion of the skewed CD7 profile in CD8 T cells. Thus, effector CD8 T-cell subsets distinguished by lowered CD7 expression expand in a manner that correlates with the magnitude of HIV-1, EBV, and CMV antigenic challenge and contract in response to successful antiretroviral treatment. The results are discussed in relation to the dual roles of CD7 as a receptor of both costimulation and cell death."
15437,0.005,1.0000,"To determine the impact that co-infection with HIV has on the radiographic presentation of pulmonary tuberculosis, we examined the chest roentgenograms obtained before treatment in 225 HIV-tested adult Haitians with bacillary (smear or culture or both) positive pulmonary tuberculosis. There were 67 HIV-seropositive and 158 HIV-seronegative patients. Intrathoracic adenopathy alone was more common and parenchymal infiltrates less common in HIV-seropositive patients (p less than 0.05). Although a parenchymal infiltrate was less likely to be cavitating in the HIV-seropositive group (p less than 0.05) when cavitary parenchymal disease was present, HIV seropositivity did not affect the number of cavities (single or multiple) or the size of the largest cavity. Patients with AIDS were significantly more likely to have a chest radiographic pattern consistent with primary tuberculosis (80 percent) than HIV-seropositive patients without AIDS (30 percent), and the latter were significantly more likely to have such a pattern than HIV-seronegative patients (11 percent) (p less than 0.05). The HIV-seropositive patients were equally infectious, regardless of the pattern of disease (primary vs postprimary). Even though pulmonary tuberculosis in an HIV-seropositive adult probably results from reactivation of dormant foci or reinfection, the pattern on the chest roentgenogram often suggests primary disease, especially if the patient has AIDS."
17585,0.005,1.0000,"During an infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) the immune system is deregulated, even before real immunodeficiency, lymphopenia and AIDS occur. The immunologic alterations that have been described are a differentiation of a T-lymphocyte subclass, Th1 to Th0. Immunologic stimulation of these Th0 cells afterwards, makes them mature into Th2 cells. This causes a imbalance between the Th1 and Th2 cells, in favor of the second group. The clinical expression of this imbalance is an elevated risk of HIV-seropositive patients for allergies and for autoimmune disease, specially those autoimmune disease in which the production of autoantibodies prevails. Sometimes of differential diagnosis with systemic lupus erythematosus is difficult. There has been describes a major prevalence of allergic diseases, especially allergic rhinitis, in adult patients infected by HIV. Reports in pediatric patients are still sporadic, and the prevalence of allergies in children infected with HIV-AIDS is unknown. Only after recognizing the allergic nature of some symptoms, the treatment will be complete, reducing morbidity and infectious complications."

Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data and history of ARV drug therapy were collected from all HIV-1-infected adult patients who attended the Day Care Center clinic from October 2, 1995 through October 31, 1999. The survival status of patients until October 31, 1999 was ascertained from the hospital records, mailing letters, and death certificates at the Provincial Health Office. Of 1110 patients who attended the clinic, we had data on duration of follow-up for 1081 (97%) with a total of 1175 person-years of observation; 607 (54.7%) patients died. Clinical status, CD4 group, ARV drug group, and registered year were independently associated with death. The adjusted hazard ratio of monotherapy to no therapy was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.87; p = .001) and that of dual therapy was 0.43 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.62; p < .001). The mortality rate of patients attending a government hospital in northern Thailand is high. Suboptimum ARV drug regimens like dual therapy had a substantial survival benefit. Further cost reduction for multiple ARV drug regimens is impatiently awaited."
7843,0.005,1.0000,"Introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy has resulted in a significant reduction in morbimortality and significant changes in the causes of death among HIV/AIDS patients. For this reason, it has become essential to monitor survival and causes of death. We constructed a survival curve based on 597 adult patients notified as AIDS cases between 1997 and 2004, at the Hospital das Clínicas, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil. Among those patients, 150 (25%) progressed to death by December, 2005. Of these, 119 were studied in detail. The data were collected from notification files of the State Health Department and the State Mortality Information System, and were complemented by analysis of medical records. These 597 patients had a survival rate of 88%, 86% and 82% after one, two and five years, respectively, and a 75% likelihood of surviving to 1,984 days (66 months). Most of the deaths occurred during the first months after the diagnosis (median, 129 days). Patients who died were predominantly young men who had sexual exposure and came from Recife (the state capital) or its metropolitan region. When the patients were first seen, a large proportion had already presented severe signs of immunodeficiency. Comparing the patients within this group, the characteristics that were associated with lower survival were: male sex, hemoglobin < 10 mg/dL, lymphocytes < 1,000/mm(3), use of fewer therapeutic drugs and antiretroviral regimens and non-introduction of protease inhibitors. Most of them died from AIDS-related diseases, particularly undefined respiratory infections."
19309,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of mycobacterial infections was determined in a sample of 155 individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who were treated in the Social Security Institute (SSI) of Cali, Colombia. A tuberculin test (2 TU PPD RT23) was used, and the presence of mycobacteria was checked through direct microscopy and culturing blood, urine, feces, and gastric aspirate. When clinically indicated, samples of cerebrospinal fluid, bone marrow, and sputum were also examined and cultivated. The absence of reactivity to tuberculin was significantly more frequent in the patients than in the controls (91.3%, compared to 57.4%; chi 2 = 33, P = 0). The prevalence of tuberculosis was 6.5%, in comparison with 0.04% among a group of HIV-negative ISS members (exact binomial 95% confidence interval: 0.0313% to 0.1154%). Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), present in 43 patients, were significantly more frequent than Mycobacterium tuberculosis (27.7%, versus 6.5%; chi 2 = 24.78, P = 0.000,001), but they caused illness only in some cases. The most common species were those of the M. avium-intracellulare complex. M. avium-intracellulare and M. fortuitum had a total prevalence of 7.1% and were the most-prevalent NTM that caused disease in these patients (4.5%); they were also responsible for three cases of disseminated infection. Clinical disease caused by M. tuberculosis or NTM and complete tuberculin anergy were associated with stage-IV HIV infection and with CD4 lymphocyte counts < or = 400/microL. However, the lack of immunocellular response, shown by limited tuberculin reactivity, was found beginning with the asymptomatic HIV carrier stage. The progressive deterioration of the immune system of HIV-positive patients is the determining factor in the high morbidity and mortality with mycobacteria infections and requires prompt chemoprophylaxis or treatment."
5117,0.005,1.0000,"With increasing life expectancy due to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the spectrum of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated morbidity and mortality has shifted from opportunistic infections toward associated chronic medical conditions. We report on a 26-year-old female patient receiving HAART for HIV infection, who developed spontaneous thrombosis of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery, resulting in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She had none of the conventional risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease. Following diagnostic coronary angiography that showed a large (16x3.4 mm) spontaneous thrombus in the proximal LAD artery, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed with prior aspiration of the occluding thrombus and implantation of a bare-metal stent. The patient was discharged with instruction of appropriate medical therapy. This case highlights the association between immunosuppression with HAART, particularly protease inhibitors, and the development of accelerated atherosclerosis in patients with HIV infection."
4678,0.005,1.0000,"In patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), increase of naive T-cell production, as measured by T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (TRECs), is an indicator of immune reconstitution. Our objective was to assess whether treating opportunistic infections (OIs) prior to HAART initiation affects CD4 T-cells recovery and TRECs in patients on HAART. HIV-infected patients presenting no OIs or treated OIs were prospectively enrolled prior to HAART initiation and followed-up over 12 months of HAART. CD4 T-cells and TRECs were measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months HAART and compared between patients presenting no OIs and those with treated OIs. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify potential factors associated with low TREC increase after 12 months HAART. Forty-four HIV-infected patients, 31 presenting no OIs and 13 with treated OIs at HAART initiation were enrolled. Patients presenting no OIs tended to have higher CD4 T-cell gain than those with treated OIs (151 vs 89 cells/μL; p = 0.05) after 6 months HAART but not after 12 months HAART (120 vs 149 cells/μL; p = 0.84). Among patients presenting no OIs, TREC levels significantly increased from baseline through 12 months HAART while among those with treated OIs, there was a trend for increase only after 12 months. Our study indicates that treatment of OIs prior to HAART does not lead to impaired CD4 T-cells recovery and thymic outputs."

This study aims to evaluate the impact of HAART and review determinants of survival in a cohort of NA/AN persons receiving treatment for HIV in a real life clinical setting. A retrospective chart review of 235 HIV-infected Native Americans receiving services at an urban medical center operated by the Indian Health Service from January 1, 1981 through June 30, 2004 was conducted, providing 782.7 person-years of follow-up. The main outcome measures were time from study entry and from incident AIDS diagnosis to death. Death rates fell from 18.4 (13.3-25.4) per 100 person-years in the period prior to 1998 to 6.4 (4.6-8.8) per 100 person-years in the years 1998-2004, (RR 0.35, p < 0.0001). Factors associated with the greatest reduction in risk of death from time of study entry were current use of HAART, HR 0.13 (0.06-0.30, p < 0.001), and CD4 count >/=200 at entry, HR 0.16 (0.08-0.35, p < 0.001). Current use of HAART was the strongest predictor of survival from time of AIDS diagnosis, HR 0.11 (0.05-0.25, p < 0.001). The use of HAART therapy and CD4 count were primary predictors of survival. Earlier diagnosis and access to effective medical treatment will be key factors in reducing disparities in health brought about by HIV infection in Native American/Alaska Native communities."
18960,0.005,1.0000,"Anemia is a common complication of pediatric HIV infection and is associated with suboptimal cognitive performance and growth failure. Routine iron supplementation is not provided to South African HIV-infected children. We hypothesized that dietary iron intake without supplementation is sufficient to protect against iron deficiency (ID) in HIV-infected children receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. In this prospective study, the difference between dietary intakes of iron-deficient children (soluble transferrin receptor >9.4 mg/L) and iron-sufficient children after 18 months on highly active antiretroviral therapy was examined. The association between iron intake and hemoglobin (Hb) concentration was also assessed. Longitudinal data collected for 18 months from 58 HIV-infected African children were assessed by generalized estimation equations, with adjustment for demographic information, dietary intakes, growth parameters, and CD4%. After adjustment for covariates, the longitudinal association between dietary iron intake and Hb concentration remained significant. This association shows that for every 1-mg increase in iron intake per day, Hb increases by 1.1 g/L (P < .001). Mean Hb increased significantly after 18 months of follow-up (106 ± 14 to 129 ± 14 g/L, P < .01), but soluble transferrin receptor also increased (7.7 ± 2.7 to 8.9 ± 3.0 mg/L, P < .01). The incidence of ID increased from 15.2% at baseline to 37.2% after 18 months. Children with animal protein intakes greater than >20 g/d had significantly lower odds for ID at 18 months than did children with lower intakes (odds ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.77). Dietary iron intake was insufficient to protect against ID, pointing to a need for low-dose iron supplementation for iron-deficient HIV-infected children and interventions to increase the consumption of animal protein."
8813,0.005,1.0000,"In this report, the prevalence and multifactorial etiology of anemia among Indian human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children are described. HIV-infected children aged 2-12 years were prospectively enrolled in 2007-2008. Measured parameters included serum ferritin, vitamin B(12), red-cell folate, soluble transferrin receptor, and C-reactive protein. Children received antiretroviral therapy (ART), iron and, folate supplements as per standard of care. Among 80 enrolled HIV-infected children (mean age 6.8 years), the prevalence of anemia was 52.5%. Etiology of anemia was found to be iron deficiency alone in 38.1%, anemia of inflammation alone in 38.1%, combined iron deficiency and anemia of inflammation alone in 7.1%, vitamin B(12) deficiency in 7.1%, and others in 9.5%. Median iron intake was 5.7 mg/day (recommended dietary allowance 18-26 mg/day). Compared to nonanemic children, anemic children were more likely to be underweight (weight Z-score -2.5 vs. -1.9), stunted (height Z-score -2.6 vs. -1.9), with lower CD4 counts (18% vs. 24%, p < 0.01), and higher log viral load (11.1 vs. 7.1, p < 0.01). Hemoglobin (Hb) improved significantly among those who started ART (baseline Hb 11.6 g/dl, 6-month Hb 12.2 g/dl, p = 0.03).

We included 72 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected patients with plasma HIV RNA loads of <500 copies/mL for at least 3 months who then discontinued therapy for at least 12 weeks. The median CD4(+) T decay while off HAART was 16 cells/mm(3)/month (interquartile range, -6 to -34 cells/month). The mean follow-up after therapy ended was 45 weeks. The slope of the CD4(+) T cell decay was inversely correlated with the increase of CD4(+) T cells while receiving HAART, baseline virus load, CD4(+) T cell count at the time therapy was discontinued, age, and duration HIV RNA levels were undetectable. In a multiple regression analysis model, the increase of CD4(+) T cells while receiving therapy and age were independently associated with the rate of CD4(+) T cell loss."

A phase I/II randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study was conducted of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of s.c. BAY 50-4798 administered to HIV-infected patients already receiving stable HAART. There were no unexpected safety findings in a population of HIV-infected patients receiving HAART plus SC BAY 50-4798 as adjunctive therapy. BAY 50-4798 exhibited nearly dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, and accumulation was minimal during multiple-dose treatment. Limited efficacy data indicated that treatment with BAY 50-4798 caused at least a transient increase in CD4(+) T cell counts in some recipients, particularly at the early time points. In general, this effect appeared to increase with increasing dose. Bay 50-4798 was generally well tolerated across the dose range tested, but a lack of potent, sustained immunologic activity suggests that further optimization of dose and schedule will be necessary."

We conducted a study to examine the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on anemia in a cohort of HIV-positive injection drug users (IDUs) in Baltimore, Maryland. At baseline, the overall prevalence of anemia was 40%. During mean follow-up of one year, among 102 subjects who received HAART, there was a mean increase in hemoglobin of 3.6 +/- 1.7 g/L (p =.0003) [corrected] and a mean decrease in log(10) plasma HIV load of 0.25 +/- 0.06 copies/ml (p <.0002) [corrected].

Multivariate analysis using mixed linear models showed that HAART was associated with an increase of hemoglobin of 0.223 g/L per month (p <.0001) after adjusting for body mass index, opportunistic infections, and gender. HAART was associated with an improvement in anemia, and potential mechanisms that may be involved include a reduction in opportunistic infections and the anemia of chronic disease and an improvement in nutritional status."
15922,0.005,1.0000,"The nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF), and the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, rilpivirine, are now available as a fixed-dose single-tablet regimen (emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF; Complera(®), Eviplera(®)) for the treatment of adults infected with HIV-1. In treatment-naïve adults, once-daily emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF was noninferior to once-daily emtricitabine/efavirenz/tenofovir DF with regard to establishing virological suppression over 96 weeks of therapy in a randomized, open-label, phase IIIb study (STaR). These data confirmed the findings of a pooled subset analysis of two earlier 96-week, double-blind, phase III trials (ECHO and THRIVE) in which treatment-naïve adults received either rilpivirine or efavirenz in combination with emtricitabine/tenofovir DF. However, the virological benefit of emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF in this setting appeared limited in patients with low CD4+ cell counts or high viral loads at baseline. In 48-week phase IIIb (SPIRIT) and IIb (Study 111) trials in treatment-experienced patients already virologically suppressed with a single- or multiple-tablet antiretroviral regimen and without prior virological failure, switching to once-daily emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF maintained virological suppression and was noninferior to remaining on a more complex multiple-tablet regimen in this regard. Emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF is generally well tolerated and appears to have a more favourable tolerability profile than emtricitabine/efavirenz/tenofovir DF. Thus, emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF is a welcome addition to the other single-tablet regimens currently available for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, providing a convenient and effective option for some adults who are treatment-naïve, as well as those who are already virologically suppressed on their current treatment regimen and wish to switch because of intolerance or to simplify their regimen.

8787,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to determine if a correlation exists between long-term azidothymidine (AZT) therapy and low pseudocholinesterase concentrations in patients who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A pilot study was conducted of 10 patients infected with HIV, 5 of whom were receiving AZT. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests, helper/inducer T lymphocyte numbers (CD4), serum dibucaine numbers, and serum pseudocholinesterase concentrations were examined. Control and study subjects both exhibited normal dibucaine numbers, but the pseudocholinesterase concentrations were significantly lower in the group that was not receiving AZT relative to the AZT treatment group. However, only two patients, neither of whom were receiving AZT, demonstrated low or borderline low pseudocholinesterase concentrations according to laboratory criteria. It is possible that pseudocholinesterase synthesis is significantly inhibited by the HIV disease process and that treatment with AZT partly reverses the inhibition. Associated variables contributing to low pseudocholinesterase concentrations in the HIV-positive patient are explored."
2218,0.005,1.0000,"Although the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has promoted the reconstitution of CD4+ T-cell count in the HIV infected population, not all patients can achieve the normalization of their immunologic functions. We analysed the variables associated with immunologic recovery, which is commonly regarded as the increase of CD4 to 350 cell/μL after a year of ART. We collected data from 3,485 patients attending a university-based HIV clinic from June 2005 to July 2014 in Shanghai, China. Logistic regression test was performed to analyse the risk factors for suboptimal CD4+ recovery following yearlong ART. The CD4+ T-cell of 723 participants (41.5% of the 1744 subjects) showed more than 350 cell/μL after one year of ART. Compared with baseline CD4 > 350 cell/μL, patients with baseline CD4 ≤ 200 cell/μL or 200 < CD4 ≤ 350 cell/μL were 42.6, 4.5 times more likely to be incomplete CD4 recovery, respectively. The risk of suboptimal immunologic recovery among patients with regimen including AZT or d4T were 2.1, 2.4 times higher compared with TDF, respectively. In our study, between optimal CD4 recovery group and suboptimal recovery group, there were no significant differences in age, gender, marital status, transmission routes, WHO stage, and CD4 recovery rates. As for the dynamic CD4 change, we found the CD4 recovery rates were 49.9% and 61.8% in the second and third year of ART, respectively. Patients who had a low level of CD4+ T-cell count (< 200 cell/μL) during the initiation of ART exhibited more difficulties recovering to a normal level. Furthermore, the regimen, including AZT or d4T, was not beneficial to CD4 recovery. So, more efforts should be made to guarantee the early diagnosis and timely treatment for HIV/AIDS patients, and simultaneously optimize antiretroviral therapy. "
13997,0.005,1.0000,"To understand the prevalence and evolution of drug resistant HIV strains in Henan China after the implementation of free antiretroviral therapy for AIDS patients. 45 drug naïve AIDS patients, 118 AIDS patients who received three months antiretroviral therapy and 124 AIDS patients who received six months antiretroviral treatment were recruited in the southern part of Henan province. Information on general condition, antiretroviral medicines, adherence and clinical syndromes were collected by face to face interview. Meanwhile, 14 ml EDTA anticoagulant blood was drawn. CD4/CD8 T cell count, viral load and genotypic drug resistance were tested. The rates of clinical improvement were 55.1% and 50.8% respectively three months and six months after antiretroviral therapy. The mean CD4 cell count after antiretroviral therapy was significantly higher than in drug naïve patients. The prevalence rate of drug resistant HIV strains were 13.9%, 45.4% and 62.7% in drug naïve patients, three month treatment patients and six month treatment patients, respectively. The number of resistance mutation codons and the frequency of mutations increased significantly with continued antiretroviral therapy. The mutation sites were primarily at the 103, 106 and 215 codons in the three-month treatment group and they increased to 15 codon mutations in the six-month treatment group. From this result, the evolution of drug resistant strains was inferred to begin with the high level NNRTI resistant strain, and then develop low level resistant strains to NRTIs. The HIV strains with high level resistance to NVP and low level resistance to AZT and DDI were highly prevalent because of the AZT+DDI+NVP combination therapy. These HIV strains were also cross resistant to DLV, EFV, DDC and D4T. Poor adherence to therapy was believed to be the main reason for the emergence and prevalence of drug resistant HIV strains. The prevalence of drug resistant HIV strains was increased with the continuation of antiretroviral therapy in the southern part of Henan province. Measures, that could promote high level adherence, provide new drugs and change ART regimens in failing patients, should be implemented as soon as possible."
16225,0.005,1.0000,"Rapid advances in biomedical science, such as pharmaceutical developments for HIV disease, must be integrated with advances in behavioral science to further our understanding of medication adherence. This article evaluates the current state of the science in adherence to antiretroviral therapy for persons with HIV. The primary objectives are to 1) identify critical determinants of adherence, and 2) describe interventions to improve adherence. Adherence is a complex dynamic behavior influenced by characteristics of the patient, treatment regimen, disease, patient-provider relationship, and clinical setting. Therefore, the most promising interventions are multifaceted and target different locations in this matrix simultaneously. Unfortunately, nonadherence remains a formidable barrier in the management of HIV, resulting in the development of resistance and drug failure. Moreover, adherence is a public health concern, with implications for the transmission of HIV in general and the transmission of drug-resistant strains of HIV specifically. Despite substantial attention to adherence in recent years, much more remains to be done to better understand and promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy through effective interventions. From this integration of biomedical and behavioral science, effective clinical interventions can be developed and implemented to enhance the health of patients with HIV."
8903,0.005,1.0000,"Toxoplasma encephalitis (TE) is usually diagnosed in advanced stages of HIV infection when the CD4+ count is <100-200 cells/µl. A 55-year-old woman with HIV/AIDS, well controlled on antiretroviral therapy (ART), CD4+ count in the 300 cells/μl range for >1 year presented with acute onset of headache, nausea and vomiting. She had been on her current ART regimen consisting of raltegravir, co-formulated emtricitabine/tenofovir and etravirine for three years and had been off Pneumocystis prophylaxis for 10 months (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Brain MRI showed multiple ring-enhancing, supratentorial and infra-tentorial parenchymal lesions suspicious for metastases. She had no other evidence of metastatic disease in her body. The possibilities of TE and primary CNS lymphoma were considered but deemed unlikely given the high CD4+ count. A brain biopsy demonstrated Toxoplasma tachyzoites. There was no evidence of lymphoma or carcinoma. Anti-toxoplasma treatment yielded good initial clinical and radiographic responses. While on TE maintenance therapy, she developed similar symptoms. Repeat MRI showed progression of lesions. Further work-up including CSF Epstein-Barr virus PCR and SPECT Th 201 imaging was not conclusive for CNS lymphoma. The patient's clinical condition deteriorated and she died. We postulate that functional immunological dysfunction is a possible mechanism by which our patient developed TE despite demonstrating sustained immune response on ART."
2041,0.005,1.0000,"A variety of factors can contribute to the failure of combination antiretroviral therapy to durably suppress viral replication in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Patients who have a low CD4(+) T cell count or high plasma viral load before therapy is initiated are at high risk for subsequent virological failure. Previous therapy is also a strong determinant of subsequent virological response, presumably because of pre-existing viral resistance. Drug exposure, as determined by adherence, drug absorption, and drug metabolism, has a significant impact on future long-term virological responses. Although definitive proof is lacking, some tissues may have limited drug penetration, thus allowing for ongoing viral replication. Understanding why combination therapy fails for HIV-infected patients may allow clinicians to individualize treatment strategies. Unfortunately, almost any factor (drug, host, or viral) that leads to virological failure of an initial combination regimen is likely to persist-and perhaps become more challenging-once a salvage regimen is initiated."
17976,0.005,1.0000,"The choice of initial antiretroviral regimen for treating people infected with HIV is crucial to successful long-term control of virus replication. Potent antiretroviral therapy substantially suppresses viral replication as measured by plasma HIV RNA levels to below limits of detection: the current standard of care is usually a combination of at least three drugs and frequently includes a protease inhibitor, or alternatively a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nnRTI). Patients who have low CD4+ cell counts (< or = 200 CD4+ cells/mm3) or high plasma HIV RNA levels (> or = 100,000 copies/ml) may not attain maximal suppression of HIV replication when treated with current regimens and may require more aggressive therapy. In contrast, patients with relatively normal CD4+ cell counts and low to non-measurable levels of plasma HIV RNA over prolonged periods (i.e., slow or non-progressors) may not require immediate antiretroviral therapy. These individuals should reconsider treatment when either the CD4+ cell count declines or the HIV RNA level increases. Early and potent antiretroviral therapy should provide more durable virological and clinical benefits for many patients, especially if they receive sufficient counselling and support to aid adherence to the treatment regimen. The optimum time to initiate antiretroviral therapy is not well established, but to maximise the recovery of the immune system and the virological and clinical benefits, initiation of therapy is generally recommended for individuals who have symptoms or those with plasma HIV RNA levels > 5000-10,000 copies/ml, or CD4+ cell counts < 500 cells/mm3. The current choice of initial antiretroviral regimens includes two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nRTI) with a potent, well-tolerated HIV-1 protease inhibitor or nnRTI. Recent short-term activity data (24-week comparative clinical trial data) indicate that regimens combining three nRTI, including abacavir, could also be considered. Other emerging combination regimens for consideration include two HIV-1 protease inhibitors with one or two nRTI, or a combination of drugs from all current categories (e.g., nRTI with a nnRTI and HIV-1 protease inhibitor). The goal of antiretroviral therapy is to maximise suppression of HIV replication and thereby prevent or delay viral resistance, restore immunological function and improve clinical outcome. Since evolution of the virus towards resistance can occur with plasma HIV RNA levels between 50 and 500 copies/ml, current standards for best suppression of HIV replication have shifted to declines in plasma HIV RNA to < 50 copies/ml. In addition, non-adherence to any regimen is associated with the greatest risk for virological failure. Therefore, both the decision to initiate therapy and the choice of initial therapy should be carefully weighted and balanced with the long-term implications of antiretroviral therapy."

Factor analysis and the Rasch measurement model were used to determine a new subscale structure for the FAHI. The content of these subscales, including physical well-being (ten items, alpha = 0.91), function and global well-being (13 items, alpha = 0.86), emotional well-being/living with HIV (10 items, alpha = 0.82), social well-being (eight items, alpha = 0.73), and cognitive functioning (three items; alpha = 0.75), reflect both general illness- and HIV/AIDS-specific QoL concerns: a total QoL score can also be calculated for the FAHI (44 items, alpha = 0.91). Psychometric evaluation revealed good internal consistency reliability for the FAHI and its subscales. In addition, construct validity, known groups validity and sensitivity to change were demonstrated by significant associations between the FAHI and additional indicators of functional status, psychological symptoms, stress and illness severity. In summary, the FAHI is a psychometrically sound instrument that captures multiple important dimensions of HIV/AIDS-related QoL. It is brief, easy to administer and score, has been translated into nine languages other than English and is appropriate for use in clinical trials and clinical practice."

Of those who reported unprotected anal intercourse with a partner of nonconcordant HIV status in the prior year, 48% were not taking ART (78% with CD4 counts >350 cells/μL). Sexually transmitted disease clinics may be an important venue in which to identify persons who are not taking ART. Treating these persons could help diminish HIV transmission."
10122,0.005,1.0000,"In South Africa, a large proportion of young women are in age disparate relationships, which is believed to be a risk factor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The aim of this study was to determine the generational effect of age disparity on HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence. Socio-demographic and behavioural data were collected from women, aged 16 and older, who were followed for up to 24 months. Women who reported having a steady sexual partner older than themselves were categorised into: (1) non-age disparate partnerships (age difference between partners was 0-4 years); (2) intra-generational age disparate partnerships (5-9 year age gap between sexual partners); and (3) inter-generational age disparate partnerships (age gap of 10 years or more between sexual partners). Of the 1355 women included in the analysis, 759, 429 and 167 were in non-age disparate, intra-generational age disparate and inter-generational age disparate partnerships, respectively. Strong predictors of inter-generational age disparate partnerships include age, marital status and concurrency of sexual partners. No significant relationship between age disparity and risk of HIV acquisition was found. The highest crude STI incidence was observed among those in intra-generational age disparate relationships followed by those in non-age disparate relationships (31.86 [26.41-38.44] and 25.60 [21.92-29.91] per 100 person-years, respectively). Reduction of multiple partnerships remains key to HIV prevention; however, in light of partner concurrency being more prevalent than individual concurrency partnerships, female-initiated HIV prevention options remain critical."

However, frequency of seroreversion remains unknown in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV-coinfected patients. We describe anti-HCV dynamics among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) following acute HCV infection and reinfection."
11958,0.005,1.0000,"A study among heterosexual men and women with multiple sexual partners was carried out to assess the seroprevalence of antibody against hepatitis C virus (HCV). The 468 participants were recruited among visitors to the Clinic for Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Amsterdam. Sera were tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Ortho), a recombinant-based immunoblot assay (RIBA; Chiron), and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 468 persons were tested, and seven (1.5%) were found ELISA positive. Another 25 (5%) were ELISA indeterminate. Six of the seven ELISA-positive cases were RIBA positive. Further serum samples from five HCV ELISA-positive persons were tested by PCR, and four were found to be positive. The HCV ELISA-positive/RIBA-indeterminate reaction was PCR negative. None of the 17 RIBA-tested sera of the ELISA-indeterminate group yielded a positive result. There was a good correlation between an ELISA optical density/cut-off ratio greater than 2 and a positive RIBA result. The risk factor for HCV appeared to be the type of sexual partner, i.e., belonging to a ""high-risk"" group for human immunodeficiency virus infection and origin from hepatitis B-endemic countries. It is concluded that HCV may be transmitted through heterosexual contact but probably with low efficiency."
17340,0.005,1.0000,"To assess the relative importance of ulcerative and non-ulcerative sexually transmitted disease in the transmission of HIV, a seroprevalence study was conducted on 2210 patients at the sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic of the S. Maria e S. Gallicano Hospital in Rome, between 1989 and 1994. Among male patients, by univariate analysis, strong predictors of HIV infection were homosexuality, sexual exposure to a HIV-positive partner, hepatitis B virus infection, and positive syphilis serology. An increased risk was estimated for patients with past genital herpes (odds ratio (OR) 3.86, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.40-18.2), and primary syphilis (OR 5.79, 95% CI 0.59-28.6). By multivariate analysis, a positive association was found with homosexuality (OR 6.9, 95% CI 2.9-16.5), and positive syphilis serology (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.3-9.2). An adjusted OR of 2.41 was calculated for current and/or past genital herpes. These results, although not conclusive, suggest a role of ulcerative diseases as risk factors for prevalent HIV infection, and indicate that positive syphilis serology is an unbiased criterion for identifying individuals at increased risk of HIV infection."
12598,0.005,1.0000,"In this report we firstly describe a case of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication occurred in a patient affected by Thalassemia major which underwent a combined chelation therapy with desferioxamine (DFO) and deferiprone (DFP). Clinical symptom and increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level were detected when the prescription of DFO (30 mg/kg) was increased from 3 to 5 days/week; a raise in HBV-DNA levels of greater than or equal to tenfold compared with baseline was thereafter detected. Diagnosis was troublesome because increasing ALT levels, first suggested toxicity to DFP administration. However, HBV reactivation in our patient cannot be definitively attributed to combined regimen administration: the patient was on regular transfusion therapy and either coincidental further infection or spontaneous reactivation of HBV could not be completely ruled out. Furthermore, a background of immunologic abnormalities had been previously reported in thalassemia and postulated to be secondary to iron overload or DFO therapy itself."
16292,0.005,1.0000,"We systematically reviewed the literature on the extent to which population characteristics or clinical features predict groups of individuals likely to develop advanced liver disease or die from chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). We searched Medline to include studies with reported cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer, or death outcomes after at least 1 year of follow-up from the measurement of predictive factors (age, age at infection, geographic location, race/ethnicity, sex, positive family history, presence of coinfections, HBV viral level, change in hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg] status, genotype, HBV mutations, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol consumption, liver enzymes, and liver biopsy finding). Evidence from 41 included articles suggested that cirrhosis, higher HBV viral level, and male sex were consistently associated with significantly increased risk of death and liver cancer. Evidence about the role of HBV genotype, HBeAg status, age and duration of infection, coinfections with hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis delta virus, and alanine aminotransferase levels were limited and inconsistent, but were deemed promising to identify patients at higher risk of clinical outcomes. Adults with chronic hepatitis B had increased risk for poorer health outcomes compared to the general population; however, the magnitude of risk varied greatly depending on baseline patient and disease characteristics, and typically clinical outcomes required many years to become manifest. Many adults with chronic hepatitis B had low absolute risks of clinical outcomes and likely would not benefit from immediate treatment. Baseline patient and disease characteristics provide important information about the risk of clinical outcomes and should be incorporated into monitoring or treatment decisions."
16017,0.005,1.0000,"The pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome has not been elucidated completely. Many findings in these patients are identical to those with immune thrombocytopenic purpura. However, recent findings in acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients including the effect of zidovudine on platelet count and the demonstration of ultrastructural changes and viral RNA in megakaryocytes, have suggested that the human immunodeficiency virus may directly infect megakaryocytes, and play a role in acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related thrombocytopenia. To investigate further the mechanism of decreased platelet counts in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, the platelet volume-number relationship and corresponding bone marrow findings in 34 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus were studied. Parameters evaluated included platelet count and mean platelet volume; bone marrow cellularity, megakaryocyte number, and number and percentage of denuded megakaryocyte nuclei. Two thirds of the platelet counts were low, and of these 92% had an inappropriately low mean platelet volume. These individuals had a platelet-volume number relationship that is very similar to that seen in myelosuppressive disorders. In addition, more than 90% of the bone marrows from thrombocytopenic patients had either normal or decreased numbers of megakaryocytes. These observations provide additional evidence to support the hypothesis that the pathophysiology of human immunodeficiency virus-associated thrombocytopenia may be due, at least in part, to a direct effect on the megakaryocytes."
9492,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to antiretroviral regimens is thought to be imperative for HIV-positive patients. However, little is known about health care professionals' willingness to discuss adherence with patients, nor what barriers, if any, may impede their adherence communication. The aims of the study were to examine physicians' beliefs regarding: (1) the efficacy of adherence communication, (2) the barriers which impede such communication, and (3) their roles and responsibilities regarding adherence communication. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 physicians who specialize in providing care to HIV-positive patients. Results showed that most physicians believed that communicating with patients about adherence issues was important, even though doing so may not have an immediate impact on patients' behaviors. Physicians believed that adherence communication was a good use of their time and fell within their role as a primary care professional. However, time constraints were cited as a barrier to performing adherence communication, indicating that physicians may do less communicating about adherence than may be optimal if they are burdened with other tasks. Results highlight the need to develop innovative strategies, such as the use of multi-disciplinary adherence teams, to ensure that each HIV-positive patient receives the optimal amount of information about and support for adherence."
2883,0.005,1.0000,"Over 850 Leishmania-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection cases have been recorded, the majority in Europe, where 7 to 17% of HIV-positive individuals with fever have amastigotes, suggesting that Leishmania-infected individuals without symptoms will express symptoms of leishmaniasis if they become immunosuppressed. However, there are indirect reasons and statistical data demonstrating that intravenous drug addiction plays a specific role in Leishmania infantum transmission: an anthroponotic cycle complementary to the zoonotic one has been suggested. Due to anergy in patients with coinfection, L. infantum dermotropic zymodemes are isolated from patient viscera and a higher L. infantum phenotypic variability is seen. Moreover, insect trypanosomatids that are currently considered nonpathogenic have been isolated from coinfected patients. HIV infection and Leishmania infection each induce important analogous immunological changes whose effects are multiplied if they occur concomitantly, such as a Th1-to-Th2 response switch; however, the consequences of the viral infection predominate. In fact, a large proportion of coinfected patients have no detectable anti-Leishmania antibodies. The microorganisms share target cells, and it has been demonstrated in vitro how L. infantum induces the expression of latent HIV-1. Bone marrow culture is the most useful diagnostic technique, but it is invasive. Blood smears and culture are good alternatives. PCR, xenodiagnosis, and circulating-antigen detection are available only in specialized laboratories. The relationship with low levels of CD4+ cells conditions the clinical presentation and evolution of disease. Most patients have visceral leishmaniasis, but asymptomatic, cutaneous, mucocutaneous, diffuse cutaneous, and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis can be produced by L. infantum. The digestive and respiratory tracts are frequently parasitized. The course of coinfection is marked by a high relapse rate. There is a lack of randomized prospective treatment trials; therefore, coinfected patients are treated by conventional regimens. Prophylactic therapy is suggested to be helpful in preventing relapses."
13410,0.005,1.0000,"Despite strong evidence of a clinical benefit from initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) immediately after diagnosis some patients remain ART naïve. We examined explanations, over a four-year period in a centralized HIV clinical cohort under universal health care, for newly diagnosed patients, while being fully engaged and retained in HIV care, delaying ART initiation for >180 days following their HIV diagnosis. All patients followed at the Southern Alberta Clinic, Calgary, Canada between 1 January 2010 and 1 January 2014 were included and followed until they moved, were lost to follow-up, died or until 1 January 2015. Of 269 patients, 56 (21.8%) deferred ART >180 days; 26 (9.7%) remained ART naïve until the end of the study. Patients delaying or deferring ART were younger, Canadian-born, and with higher CD4 counts (p < .01). ""No clinical urgency"" especially for patients with higher CD4 counts, was most often listed for deferring ART, however when ART was offered ""patient not ready"", ""unstable substance use"", ""difficulties adjusting"" or ""wanting to wait"" were often cited regardless of CD4 levels. At times ART, when offered, was adamantly declined by the patient. The physician's assessment of a patient's ability to adhere to lifelong ART was an issue in some cases. While structural or financial issues may impact ART initiation, our results suggest that, even in an environment of free and easy access to ART, many challenges still exist at the implementation stage. Intense efforts in both patient and physician education will be required if the benefits of early ART as recommended by the WHO in their recent guidelines, are to be achieved at the individual and population level."

However, the relationship between seroreversion and spontaneous virus clearance has yet to be precisely determined in a single homogeneous population of untreated immunocompetent patients. In this study, 32 human immunodeficiency virus-seronegative hemophiliacs who had been exposed to HCV were followed for a mean duration of 141 months; 22 remained chronic carriers (68.8%). All but 1 of the nonviremic patients (90.0%) showed partial (8 cases) or complete (2 cases) seroreversion. In contrast, all but 1 of the viremic patients (95.1%) had a stable serologic profile when analyzed by a recombinant immunoblot assay. The results indicate that any HCV antibody-positive immunocompetent patient with no detectable serum HCV RNA and normal alanine aminotransferase values and whose serial samples show a progressive decrease in the level of HCV antibodies present may be considered as having a resolved infection."

Vaccination of health workers plays a critical role in protecting them from sequelae of HBV; however, health-worker vaccination remains a challenge for many countries. This study was conducted to review practices/measures and challenges in the Sub-Saharan region relating to vaccination of health workers against HBV. We performed a literature review of articles addressing any aspect of HBV vaccination of health workers in the Sub-Saharan region sourced from PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, including a case study of Malawi policies and strategies in training institutions and facilities. Our findings indicated that HBV awareness and vaccination were relatively high, but vaccination rates were lower, with 4.6-64.4% of those ""ever vaccinated"" completing the vaccination regimen. There was also great variation in the proportion of health workers exhibiting natural immunity from previous exposure (positive for anti-Hepatitis B core antibodies; 41-92%). Commonly cited reasons for non-uptake of vaccine included cost, lack of awareness of vaccine availability, and inadequate information concerning the vaccine. Countries in this region will require locally relevant data to develop cost-effective strategies that maximize the benefit to their health workers due to the great diversity of HBV epidemiology in the region."

In some cohorts of HIVpositive patients, GB virus C (GBVC) has been associated with prolonged survival and time to AIDS. We set out to address whether GBVC infection had any influence on survival in a cohort of 112 homosexual white HIV-1 positive Danish men. Patients were enrolled between 1984 and 1987 and followed for a mean of 6.7 years. Follow-up was censored in May 1996 when the first patient in the cohort received HAART. Plasma samples were screened at baseline using polymerase chain reaction methods for GBVC. Of the 112 patients, 27 (24%) were positive for GBVC. No difference in time to AIDS or death was observed between the GBVCnegative and -positive patients. Furthermore, no difference in CD4+ T cell decline was observed in the first year following blood sampling between the GBVC-positive and -negative groups."
11856,0.005,1.0000,"The mechanisms underlying blood-brain barrier (BBB) compromise in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the ways in which BBB compromise might impair neurocognitive function remain poorly understood. This study had two aims: (1) to examine the relationship between BBB breakdown, measured using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI), plasma viral load, and neurological status; and (2) to examine the influence of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the relationship between neuroinflammation using myoinositol/creatine (mI/Cr), a surrogate marker of glial activation as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and BBB compromise determined by CE-MRI. In 25 HIV-infected patients, we found that: (1) the severity of neurocognitive impairment correlated with the degree of BBB breakdown in the basal ganglia; (2) for any given degree of BBB compromise, patients with high plasma viral load were more severely impaired; (3) BBB compromise correlated with mI/Cr in the basal ganglia; and (4) for any given level of mI/Cr, the severity of BBB compromise and the severity of neurocognitive impairment were significantly less in patients on HAART than in those who were HAART-naive. These results confirm a role for BBB compromise in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment and suggest that elevated plasma viral load in the presence of BBB compromise may increase the risk for development of HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Additionally, they suggest a salutary effect of HAART on the incidence and severity of HAD, which may, in part, be due to protection of BBB integrity."

Complexities surrounding patients' decisions to use ZDV in accordance with the treatment arm protocol of this study must be communicated to women, especially the consequences for both themselves and their potential children. In March 1994, a public-private partnership was formed to develop and test the impact of patient education information on 076 and to explore cultural differences in decision-making surrounding ZDV use during pregnancy. Objectives were (1) to develop an efficacious patient informational booklet on the results of ACTG 076 and (2) to determine the differential attitudes and behavioral intentions of women toward taking AZT during pregnancy. A multi-disciplinary group of providers and researchers developed the patient education booklet and field-tested it in five New York City area sites. Subjects were a multiethnic group of women of childbearing age who were predominantly HIV-positive or at risk of HIV infection (n = 120). This 076 education resulted in a substantial increase in intention to use ZDV to reduce perinatal transmission despite full disclosure of the unknowns (P < .001). There were differences in knowledge acquired between racial/ethnic groups, which must be viewed cautiously since the study did not assess socioeconomic status adequately. Attitudes toward ZDV (P < .05), trust in health care providers (P < .03), and opinions on whether testing should be voluntary (P < .02) also varied by race/ethnicity.

18430,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy among HIV patients is the most important patient-enabled factor related to virological failure and can lead to drug resistance. It is important to avoid virological failure, especially in resource-limited settings where treatment options are limited and the effects of treatment failure are profound. This qualitative study aimed to identify the psycho-social factors related to adherence behaviour in Gaborone, Botswana, a high prevalence setting in southern Africa. One-to-one, in-depth interviews were conducted with adult antiretroviral patients in the private and public health sectors who had been on antiretroviral therapy for a minimum of 6 months. A grounded theory approach was adopted and patients were selected purposively and theoretical sampling determined the final sample size. Thirty-two patients were interviewed, 22 from the public-sector, the mean age was 9.5 years and 53% were women. We found that acceptance of HIV-status, the ability to avoid internalising stigmatising attitudes and identification of an encouraging confidante were key factors related to good adherence. Encouraging confidantes (including clinicians) and contributed to promoting hope and acceptance of HIV-status, enabling patients to develop a positive therapeutic relationship with their antiretrovirals and make lifestyle changes that promoted adherence. Active participation in a social network and a desire to avoid being thin and visibly identifiable as HIV-positive were also adherence-motivating factors. Conversely, participants who expressed some degree of denial about their HIV-status tended to express emotions associated with depression, and internalised stigma that inhibited the development of a relationship with a confidante. We feel it is important to identify individuals with HIV who are still in some degree of denial about their status and to identify depression among patients on antiretrovirals. This will enable more targeted, individualised support in the management of individuals' HIV disease."

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status has also been implicated in the development of postpartum depression, but the association between maternal depression and infant social behavior in the context of HIV infection has not been fully investigated. First, we examined the relationship between maternal postpartum depression and infant social withdrawal at 10-12 months of age in HIV-infected mothers and infants. Second, we ascertained whether infant social withdrawal could be significantly predicted by maternal postpartum depression. The sample consisted of 83 HIV-infected mother-infant dyads. Mothers were assessed for postpartum depression with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and infant social withdrawal behavior was rated using the Modified Alarm Distress Baby Scale (m-ADBB). 42.2% of the mothers scored above the cut-off point for depression on the EPDS, and a third of infants (31%) were socially withdrawn. Notably, maternal depression did not predict infant social withdrawal as measured by the m-ADBB. Infant social withdrawal was also not significantly associated with failure to thrive or gender. These preliminary findings need further investigation with respect to the impact on long-term neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes."
16372,0.005,1.0000,"Mood disorders are more frequent among people with HIV infection than among non-HIV-infected individuals of the same age, socioeconomic status, and HIV risks. They have been associated with worse adherence and clinical outcomes, yet remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in sub-Saharan Africa. We explored the relationship between mood disorders using the 10-item depression scale of the Centers for Epidemiological Studies (CES-D10) and the 22-item Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) for posttraumatic stress disorder, and a range of demographic and HIV-related variables among 252 consecutive subjects on antiretroviral therapy (ART). The study was conducted in the Genito-Urinary Medicine Clinic of the Medical Research Council's Gambia Unit. These screening tests were positive in 7% and 30%, respectively, of the patients, with higher scores (more depression or more post-traumatic stress) associated with female gender, more advanced WHO clinical stage, and lower Karnofsky Perfomance Scale rating. Higher CES-D10 scores were also seen among those on their second ART regimen. No relationship was seen with age, time on ART, viral load, or CD4 cell count. Compared to an earlier study at the same site in subjects prior to starting ART, the prevalence of depression in those stabilized on ART was dramatically reduced (by 34%, from 41%) while that of PTSD dropped less (by 13%, from 43%). Integrating the CES-D10 or a similar instrument into patient preparation for ART is recommended in order to identify those who may benefit from further mental health investigations, specific therapy, or closer follow-up during early ART."
1449,0.005,1.0000,"Historically, hepatitis B virus (HBV) liver transplantation (LT) recipients have less acute cellular rejection (ACR) than those without HBV. We questioned whether this has persisted in an era of decreased Hepatitis B immunoglobulin use (HBIG) given its in vitro immunoregulatory effects. We compared the incidence, risk factors and outcomes of ACR among 40,593 primary LT recipients with HBV, hepatitis C, steatohepatitis, and immune liver disease (OPTN 2000-2011). We also assessed the in vitro effect of HBIG on alloimmune lymphoproliferation and regulatory T cell generation using mixed lymphocyte reactions. In multivariate analysis, HBV status remained a strong independent predictor of freedom from ACR (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 1.5-2.1). Patient (67.7% vs 72.3%) and graft (60.8% vs 69.1%) survival were significantly lower in patients with ACR versus no ACR for all causes except HBV. HBIG use had no statistical association with ACR. In vitro, HBIG at concentrations equivalent to clinical dosing did not inhibit lymphoproliferation or promote regulatory T cell development. In summary, the incidence and impact of ACR is lower now for HBV LT and does not appear to be secondary to HBIG by our in vitro and in vivo analyses. Rather, it may be due to the innate immunosuppressive properties of chronic HBV infection."
5894,0.005,1.0000,"People living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) in developing countries can live longer due to improved treatment access, and a deeper understanding of determinants of their quality of life is critical. This study assessed the link between social capital, operationally defined in terms of social networks (group-based and personal social networks) and access to network resources (access to material and non-material resources and social support) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among 554 (55% female) adults on HIV treatment through South Africa's public health system. Female study participants were involved with more group-based social networks but had fewer personal social networks in comparison to males. Access to network resources was higher among females and those from larger households but lower among older study participants. Experience of social support significantly increased with household economic status and duration at current residence. Social capital indicators were unrelated to HIV disease status indicators, including duration since diagnosis, CD4 count and viral load. Only a minority (13%) of study participants took part in groups formed by and for predominantly PLHIV (HIV support groups), and participation in such groups was unrelated to their mental or physical health. Personal rather than group-linked social networks and access to network resources were significantly associated with mental but not physical health, after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. The findings of limited participation in HIV support groups and that the participation in such groups was not significantly associated with physical or mental health may suggest efforts among PLHIV in South Africa to normalise HIV as a chronic illness through broad-based rather than HIV-status bounded social participation, as a strategy for deflecting stigma. Further research is required to examine the effects of HIV treatment on social networking and participation among PLHIV within both rural and other urban settings of South Africa."
6952,0.005,1.0000,"The paper uses a hybrid cost model to identify the determinants of cost variation among programs that offer early intervention services to people living with HIV and AIDS in the US. The model combines the effects of input price and output volume measures from traditional economic cost functions with institutional factors based on program and patient characteristics on the cost of providing primary medical care and support services to people living with HIV and AIDS. The impact of economic factors conforms to conventional theory and reveals the potential for cost savings through greater economies of scale and substitutability of low cost for high cost labor inputs. Similarly, programs that use staff more efficiently and share an affiliation with other organizations exhibit lower costs than more labor intensive and non-affiliated providers. However, patient characteristics are equally important determinants of program spending. Minority patients use services less frequently and generate fewer costs, while patients facing fewer barriers to care, such as those with Medicaid coverage, access services more frequently and incur higher costs. Uninsured patients also generate higher costs, but the higher costs associated with this subgroup more likely stem from a lack of continuity in care and, thus, poorer health status and greater healthcare needs when treatment is sought. Injection drug users require less expensive services, but access services more frequently than other risk groups, while patients with an AIDS diagnosis and those who are co-infected with hepatitis C require more program resources. By separately estimating the economic and institutional determinants of program costs, the study highlights the relative importance of factors that are amendable to internal cost control efforts versus those that reflect the resource needs of local communities."

We aimed to examine the HIV prevalence, age and gender distribution, and the effectiveness of HAART on CD4 positive cell count, viral load (VL), and mortality in the Greenland HIV-infected population. In this population-based cohort study we collected demographic, clinical and biochemical data on all HIV-infected patients followed in health clinics since 1995. For each case, we identified 100 age- and gender-matched population controls. The HIV cohort included 103 patients of whom 91% were Inuit; 81% were infected heterosexually. Only 40% of the patients had a VL <400 copies/ml at 48 weeks after starting HAART, and patients on HAART had a substantial excess relative mortality compared with the general population (mortality rate ratio [MRR]: 10.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.9-16.4). After the introduction of HAART, the mortality decreased (MRR: 2.5; 95% CI 0.9-6.8), but remained high with a mortality rate of 62 per 1000 person-years (py) (95% CI 29-129).

17359,0.005,1.0000,"The transmission of infections from the biologic mother to her offspring is popularly known as perinatal infection (PI). It is not synonymous to infections during the perinatal or neonatal period. Physicians should avoid focusing attention only on the TORCH agents in the evaluation of suspected PI. Perinatal period begins from 28 weeks of gestation. Would one consider in utero infections in the first or second trimester of pregnancy as PIs? Developing countries have difficulty in collecting reliable and accurate data of PIs. These data are useful to define the magnitude of the problems, to monitor the trends, to recognise the mode of spread, and to find a solution of PIs. Most PIs are asymptomatic and diagnosis is extremely difficult. Developing countries need rapid, easy-to-operate, simple, and cheap diagnostic tools urgently. Access to health care in the remote city is limited. Newer drugs are too expensive and very few patients can benefit from these. Each developing country should prioritize its PI problems and tackle those that have serious public health problems and socio-economic impact. Most developing countries should focus on HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and HBV (hepatitis B virus) infections. Other countries where ophthalmia, malaria or tuberculosis are prevalent or endemic, should focus on these. Developing countries are more willing to allocate the budget for prevention of diseases than for treatment. There may be problem of promulgating the information on prevention of diseases because of illiteracy, multi-lingual community. Vaccines where available, should be affordable. Other effective prevention guidelines should be workable in poorer nations.

This study assessed whether non-disclosure is associated with psychological symptoms, non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and viral load (VL) non-suppression. A total of 3258 HIV-diagnosed individuals in the UK completed the confidential ASTRA study questionnaire (2011-2012). Participants reported whether they told anyone they had HIV; to which confidant(s) (friends, family, work colleagues, stable partner) and to what extent (none, some, most/all). The prevalence and factors associated with non-disclosure were assessed. Associations between non-disclosure and the following factors were established using modified Poisson regression with adjustment for socio-demographic factors (gender, age group, ethnicity), HIV-related factors (time since HIV diagnosis, ART status), and clinic: low social support (score ≤ 12 on modified Duke-UNC FSSQ); depression and anxiety symptoms (≥10 on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 respectively); self-reported ART non-adherence in past 2 weeks/3 months; VL non-suppression (clinic-recorded VL > 50 copies/mL among those who started ART ≥ 6 months ago). Among 3233 participants with disclosure data, the prevalence of non-disclosure to anyone was 16.6 % (n/N = 61/367) among heterosexual men, 15.7 % (98/626) among women, and 5.0 % (113/2240) among MSM. MSM were more likely to disclose to some/all friends compared to family (85.8 vs. 59.9 %) while heterosexuals were less likely to disclose to friends than family (44.1 vs. 61.1 % for men, 57.5 vs. 67.1 % for women). Among 1,631 participants with a stable partner, non-disclosure to a stable partner was 4.9 % for MSM, 10.9 % for heterosexual men, and 13.0 % for women. In adjusted analyses, older age (≥60 years), non-white ethnicity, more recent HIV diagnosis, and not having a stable partner were significantly associated with overall non-disclosure for MSM and heterosexual individuals. The prevalence of low social support was 14.4 %, of depression and anxiety symptoms 27.1 and 22.0 %, respectively, of ART non-adherence 31.8 %, and of viral load non-suppression on ART 9.8 %. There was no evidence that non-disclosure overall (versus disclosure to anyone) was associated with low social support, depression or anxiety symptoms, ART non-adherence or VL non-suppression among MSM or heterosexual individuals. However, compared to MSM who disclosed to 'none' or 'some' friends and family, MSM who disclosed to 'most or all' of their friends and family were more likely to have symptoms of depression (adjusted PR = 1.4, 95 % CI 1.2-1.7), anxiety (1.3, 1.1-1.6), and to report ART non-adherence (1.3, 1.1-1.5). In this large multicentre study of people living with HIV in the UK, non-disclosure was overall low, but higher for heterosexual individuals compared to MSM. Non-disclosure was not associated with higher prevalence of adverse health measures."
653,0.005,1.0000,"Despite a burgeoning literature on adherence to HIV therapies, few studies have examined the impact of ongoing drug use on adherence and viral suppression, and none of these have utilized electronic monitors to quantify adherence among drug users. We used 262 electronic monitors to measure adherence with all antiretrovirals in 85 HIV-infected current and former drug users, and found that active cocaine use, female gender, not receiving Social Security benefits, not being married, screening positive for depression, and the tendency to use alcohol or drugs to cope with stress were all significantly associated with poor adherence. The strongest predictor of poor adherence and, in turn, failure to maintain viral suppression, was active cocaine use. Overall adherence among active cocaine users was 27%, compared to 68% among subjects who reported no cocaine use during the 6-month study period. Consequently, 13% of active cocaine users maintained viral suppression, compared to 46% of nonusers. Interventions to improve adherence should focus on reducing cocaine use, developing adaptive coping skills, and identifying and treating depression."
12672,0.005,1.0000,"The free antiretroviral therapy (ART) program in India has scaled up to register second largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS across the globe. To assess the effectiveness of current first-line regimen we estimated virological suppression on completion of 1 year of ART. The study describes the correlates of virological failure (VF) and multinucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) drug resistance mutations (DRMs).In this cross-sectional study conducted between June and August 2014, consecutive adults from 4 State sponsored ART clinics of western India were recruited for plasma viral load screening at 12 ± 2 months of ART initiation. Individuals with plasma viral load >1000 copies/mL were selected for HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) genotyping. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with VF and multi-NRTI resistance mutations. Criteria adopted for multi-NRTI resistance mutation were either presence of K65R or 3 or more thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) or presence of M184V along with 2 TAMs.Of the 844 study participants, virological suppression at 1 year was achieved in 87.7% of individuals. Factors significantly associated with VF (P < 0.005) were 12 months CD4 count of ≤100 cells/μL (adjusted OR -7.11), low reported adherence (adjusted OR -4.44), and those living without any partner (adjusted OR -1.98). In patients with VF, the prevalence of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) DRM (78.75%) were higher as compared to NRTI (58.75%). Multi-NRTI DRMs were present in 32.5% of sequences and were significantly associated with CD4 count of ≤100 cells/μL at baseline (adjusted OR -13.00) and TDF-based failing regimen (adjusted OR -20.43). Additionally, low reported adherence was negatively associated with multi-NRTI resistance (adjusted OR -0.11, P = 0.015). K65R mutation was significantly associated with tenofovir (TDF)-based failing regimen (P < 0.001).The study supports early linkage of HIV-infected individuals to the program for ART initiation, adherence improvement, and introduction of viral load monitoring. With recent introduction of TDF-based regimen, the emergence of K65R needs to be monitored closely among HIV-1 subtype C-infected Indian population. "
11677,0.005,1.0000,"One hundred and ninety-three adults with HIV taking antiretroviral therapy completed a questionnaire on demographics, health beliefs, medication side-effects, and adherence to dose, schedule, and dietary instructions. Three health beliefs indices were identified: antiretroviral therapy (ART) benefits, ART adherence self-efficacy, and beliefs about future HIV-related health concerns. Patients who experienced medication side-effects reported strong beliefs that HIV infection would cause them future health problems or distrust in the benefits of ART. AIDS diagnosis obtained through medical records or medication side-effects were not related to any of the three types of adherence. Beliefs about future HIV-related health concerns were associated with suboptimal dose adherence. Beliefs about ART benefits were associated with suboptimal schedule and dietary instructions adherence. Older age and partner were protective factors of schedule adherence. Data suggest that health beliefs may vary across type of adherence and that adherence behaviours may be a coping strategy to adjust antiretroviral therapy to one's daily living."
9625,0.005,1.0000,"This nonexperimental, descriptive study examined relationships between recent intimate partner violence (IPV) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among women. Data from 272 HIV-infected women receiving care at a large HIV clinic were obtained through interviews and medical record abstraction. The Severity of Violence Against Women Scale was used to determine IPV experience in the previous 12 months; the prevalence of recent IPV in our sample was 52%. Mean Domestic Violence Specific Morisky Medication Adherence Scale scores among women experiencing recent IPV were significantly lower (M = 5.49, SD = 2.06) than in women without IPV experiences (M = 6.57, SD = 1.57, t[262.1] = 4.91, p < .001). A greater proportion of detectable viral loads (Fisher's exact p < .001) was found in women experiencing recent IPV compared to women who did not experience IPV. The data indicate that clinicians should screen HIV-infected women frequently for IPV when assessing ART adherence. "
10853,0.005,1.0000,"Among disadvantaged persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV), patient-provider engagement, which has been defined as patient-provider relationships that promote the use of health care services and are characterized by active listening and supportive decision making, has been associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) maintenance and viral suppression. However, chronic pain, depression, and substance use, all of which are prevalent in this population, can reduce the quality of patient-provider engagement. We hypothesized a model in which chronic pain, depression, and substance use would be associated with poorer patient-provider engagement, which would be positively associated with adherence, with the latter associated positively with viral suppression. We analyzed data from the BEACON study, which included surveys from 383 PLHIV who were primarily African American, on ART, and had histories of drug use. Due to six missing cases on the chronic pain variable, we used data from 377 respondents in a structural equation model. Chronic pain and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with poorer patient-provider engagement, while substance use was associated with better engagement. Patient-provider engagement in turn was associated with better ART adherence, which was associated with higher viral suppression. Results suggest the role of chronic pain in poor patient-physician engagement in this population, which has potential implications for quality of HIV patient care and health outcomes. Findings suggest the need for attention to patient-provider engagement in PLHIV."
19777,0.005,1.0000,Repeat infections with Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women are common and may increase the risk of HIV transmission. Patient delivered partner treatment (PDPT) has been shown to reduce repeat infections of other sexually transmitted diseases.

3592,0.005,1.0000,"We performed a serosurvey of 133 embalmers in an urban area where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is prevalent. Although we found histories of needlesticks to be common, and the seropositivity rate of hepatitis B virus (HBV) (13%) was approximately twice that of a blood donor comparison group, HIV antibody was uniformly absent in 129 embalmers who denied HIV risk factors, and present in one of four with self-described risk behaviors. The risk of HBV infection was higher among embalmers who have worked more than 10 years, relative risk (RR) 16.2 (95% confidence interval 2.1, 126.5), did not routinely wear gloves, RR 9.8 (CI 3.4, 28.5), or are employed in the city of Boston, RR 4.7 (CI 1.8, 12.0)."
4198,0.005,1.0000,"Prevention of AIDS is very complex and requires, apart from basic knowledge about modes of transmission and protection, individual awareness of personal risk of infection and modification of one's risky behavior. Perception of risk has been suggested as an important element of sexual behavior change among people who engage in behaviors that place them at risk of HIV infection. This study investigates perceived risk of an HIV infection among inhabitants of municipality of Palilula. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative accuracy of risk assessment, especially for those with high-risk sexual behavior and to assess the factors related to self perception of developing AIDS. The survey was conducted as a household survey in Belgrade municipality ""Palilula"". The design of the survey was based on a two-stage stratified random sample. The population of Palilula municipality was divided in two stratums and 840 households were selected from each stratum. All members of selected households aged 15-49 years were interviewed. Total of 2659 persons was interviewed. Self administered questionnaire, developed by WHO and described in the Evaluation of National AIDS Programme: A Methods Package 1. Prevention of HIV infection, Geneva, 1994, was translated and adapted for local application. For analysis of findings methods of descriptive statistics, chi square test and logistic regression were used. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS/PC. The results showed that most of the respondents (1662, 62.5%) do not perceive themselves to be at risk of HIV infection. Interestingly, almost one quarter of the sample couldn't estimate personal chances of being HIV infected. Significantly larger proportion of respondents living in urban area than those living in rural area perceived themselves at risk (17.1% of urban vs. 7.7% from rural area, chi square = 54.06, Ir0.00). Significant differences between age groups were found for perception of personal risk. Respondents up to 19 and those older than 25 in more than 60 percent and only a half of those between 20 and 24 believed that there was no chance they could become HIV infected. Almost 16% of respondents between 20 and 24 believed that they had some chances of contracting HIV, also approximately one third of them couldn't estimate personal risk of contracting HIV infection (chi square = 2.10, p = 0.00)(Graphe 1). Those who engaged in sex with irregular partners were found to perceive themselves in higher risk then those who were engaged in sex only with regular partners in previous 12 months. One fifth of those with irregular partners estimated their chances as good versus only 10% of those with only regular partners. A logistic regression analysis found that those who believed they were personally at risk knew someone with HIV, had more irregular sexual partners in last 12 months, were younger, and lived in urban area (Table 1). People correctly perceived the risk of HIV infection as being minimal as most of them didn't engage in risk behavior. Risk perception was higher among those who had more irregular partners, younger and those from urban area. Most important predictor of risk perception was knowledge of HIV positive individual."
6302,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of the study was to examine the interrelationships among HIV-related public and felt stigma, worry of HIV infection, HIV/AIDS knowledge and intention to disclose HIV testing results in a rural area of China, where HIV spread among former commercial blood donors. A one-group pretest-posttest study was conducted among 605 marriage license applicants. The following relationships showed statistical significance in path analysis: (1) HIV/AIDS knowledge --> worry [beta (Standardized coefficient) = -0.39]; (2) worry --> public stigma (beta = 0.27); (3) public stigma --> felt stigma (beta = 0.22); and (4) felt stigma --> intention to disclosure (beta = -0.20). Separate path analyses for males and females generated similar association patterns. HIV counseling reduced perceived worry but exerted little impact on HIV-related stigma and the intention. The pathway from a lack of HIV/AIDS knowledge to increased stigma and to decreased intention to disclose one's serostatus is particularly policy relevant as decreased intention to disclosure may be related to continuing practice of HIV risk behaviors. The findings demonstrate interventions aiming at the reduction of stigma should be targeted at both the individual and community levels."
19346,0.005,1.0000,"A prevalence study of HBV serologic markers was carried out among hospital employees of ten departments of the Second School of Medicine in Naples, an urban area with a high prevalence of HBV infection. Departments and occupational categories were selected to represent a spectrum of different exposure to B virus infection. Workers in a large electronic plant in the same geographical area were screened as controls. HBsAg prevalence was 4.8% in the hospital community and 4.0% in control group. It rises to 4.3% in the Campania Region, where all screened workers live, and in some specific areas of the same region it rises to 12%. But no significant difference among seropositivities for at least 1 marker of HBV, considered to be a better indicator of occupational hazard, was found among personnel of different departments or belonging to different occupational categories. None of the occupational and non-occupational risk factors studied was found to be significantly associated with HBV infection. Two years later, an incidence study was carried out among susceptible subjects. Seropositivity for 1 marker was 2.2% among hospital workers and 2.8% in the control group. These figures are lower than the annual attack rate (5%) required for an acceptable cost-benefit ratio of vaccination against hepatitis B. Our results indicate that in a geographical area with HBV endemicity the occupational hazard for B virus infection is low in hospital workers because of the high number of the high number of immunized subjects and the contacts with infected people out of the hospital."
17386,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B and C virus markers were assessed during a survey on malaria in gold mine camps in southern Brazilian Amazon in order to identify risk factors associated to these viral diseases. The study comprised 520 subjects, most of them were gold miners. Missing subjects totaled 49 (8.6%). Among these 520, 82.9% had HBV markers and 7.1% were HBsAg positive. Previous hospitalization, surgery, sexually transmitted diseases and incarceration were quite common among surveyed people, but there is no association between total HBV markers and these factors. On other hand, HBsAg was independently associated to history of sexually transmitted diseases and history of surgery after adjustment. The most frequent HBsAg subtypes identified, adw2 (59%), predominates in populations of Northeast Brazil. The most surveyed people were immigrants coming from that area suggesting that immigrants carried HBV themselves to the study area. Immunoblot (RIBA) confirmed-anti-HCV were found in 2.1%. The only variable associated to anti-HCV in multivariate analysis was illicit intravenous drug. Lack of HCV infection in subjects with such a high HBV markers prevalence reinforces the opinion that HCV is transmitted by restricted routes when compared to HBV. Furthermore, gold miners in Amazon may be considered as a risk group for HBV infection, but not for HCV."

Xinjiang province in China is an endemic area for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), however, currently, only limited data for KSHV infection among HIV-infected individuals living in this endemic area is available. A cross-sectional study of 86 HIV positive participants was conducted in Xinjiang, China from 2014 through 2015. Plasma samples were collected and screened for KSHV and HIV infection. HIV pol gene and KSHV ORF-K1 gene were amplified and sequenced, genotypes were determined by phylogenetic analysis. Over all, prevalence was 48.9% (42/86; 95%CI 38.4-59.3%) for KSHV. Only CRF07_BC subtype has been identified among all these HIV positive individuals, while the subtype A and C of KSHV were detected in the participants. Meanwhile, we found that those with high CD4 counts (>500) showed a lower anti-KSHV titer, compared with other groups. Our study indicated a high prevalence of KSHV among HIV positive individuals in Xinjiang, China. Thus, management of HIV/AIDS patients should include KSHV screen and should consider the risk of KSHV-associated malignancies."

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and possible risk factors of HAV infection among solid waste collectors in a municipality of the broader region of Attica, Greece. A cross-sectional sero-prevalence study was conducted. Fifty (n=50) waste collectors participated in the study (response rate: 95%). The group of municipal waste collectors was compared to a convenient sample of workers not exposed to solid waste (n=83). Municipal solid waste collectors recorded a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of anti-HAV(+) in comparison to subjects without occupational exposure to waste (40% vs 34% respectively p=0,4). No significant associations were found between inappropriate work practices and anti- HAV (+). Education was the only factor independently associated with the risk of HAV infection. This study did not corroborate previous reports of an increased prevalence of Hepatitis A Virus infection among municipal solid waste collectors."
9366,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia complex is a common and devastating manifestation of the late phases of HIV infection. The pathogenesis of dementia complex is poorly understood and effective treatments have not been developed, in part because of the lack of an appropriate animal model. Mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (scid mice), which accept xenografts without rejection, were intracerebrally inoculated with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and HIV. One to 4 weeks after inoculation, the brains of these mice contained human macrophages (some of which were HIV p24 antigen positive), occasional multinucleated cells, and striking gliosis by immunocytochemical staining. Human macrophages also were frequently positive for tumor necrosis factor type alpha and occasionally for interleukin 1 and VLA-4. Cultures of these brains for HIV were positive. Generally, human macrophages were not present in the brains of control mice, nor was significant gliosis, and HIV was not recovered from mice that received HIV only intracerebrally. Pathologically, this model of HIV encephalitis in scid mice resembles HIV encephalitis in humans and the data suggest that the activation of macrophages by infection with HIV results in their accumulation and persistence in brain and in the development of gliosis. This model of HIV encephalitis should provide insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of this disorder."
9572,0.005,1.0000,"To identify early predictors of a severe or fulminant course in patients with acute viral hepatitis B (AVH-B). One hundred and thirty-eight patients with symptomatic acute hepatitis B observed from 1999 to 2012 were enrolled. For each patient, the demographics, risk factors for the acquisition of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, clinical, biochemical and virological data (HBV DNA, HBV DNA sequences) were recorded and analysed. The HBV mutants in the polymerase region were sought in 110 (87%) patients by direct sequencing, and the rtM204V/I mutations also by an allele-specific PCR. AVH-B was severe in 13 (9.4%) of the 138 patients enrolled, fulminant in 6 (4.3%) and with a normal clinical course in 119. The 19 patients with severe or fulminant AVH-B more frequently than the 119 with a normal course stated intravenous drug use (63.2% versus 36.1%, p 0.04) and were HBV-DNA negative (31.6% versus 11.8%, p 0.03) and anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive (57.9% versus 19.3%, p 0.0008); the prevalences of different HBV genotypes and of the rtM204V/I mutant were similar in these three forms of AVH-B. A multivariate logistic regression analysis identified a pre-existing HCV chronic infection as the only factor independently associated with a severe or fulminant clinical course of AVH-B (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.5-15.94, p 0.01). A pre-existing HCV chronic infection was identified as the only factor independently associated with a severe clinical presentation of acute hepatitis B, an association most probably due to the combination of the liver lesions caused by acute hepatitis B and the pre-existing histological abnormalities related to HCV chronic infection.

2266,0.005,1.0000,"Experimental evidence from animal models has provided a framework for our current understanding of autoimmune disease pathogenesis and supports the importance of genetic predisposition, molecular mimicry, and immune dysregulation. However, only recently has evidence emerged to support the role of immune dysregulation in human organ-specific autoimmune disease. In the current study of the ""late"" manifestation of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) in a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients following highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we discuss how immune dysregulation and factors associated with the immunopathology of HIV infection fit the current understanding of autoimmunity and provide a plausible basis for our clinical observations. De novo diagnoses of thyroid disease were identified between 1996 and 2002 in 7 HIV treatment centers (5/7 centers completed the study). Patients were diagnosed as clinical case entities and not discovered through thyroid function test screening. Paired plasma specimens were used to demonstrate sequential rise in thyroid antibodies. Seventeen patients were diagnosed with AITD (median age, 38 yr; 65% were of black African or black Caribbean ethnicity; and 82% were female). The median duration of immune reconstitution was 17 months. Graves disease (GD) was diagnosed in 15 of 17 patients. One patient developed hashithyrotoxicosis with atypically raised C-reactive protein, and another developed hypothyroidism. One GD patient had associated secondary hypoadrenalism. The estimated combined prevalence of GD for 4 treatment centers for female patients was 7/234 and for males was 2/1289. The denominator numbers were matched controls, from 4 centers able to provide data, who commenced HAART during the same time (January 1996 to July 2002) and who did not develop clinical AITD. The mean baseline pre-HAART CD4 count was 67 cells/mL, and the mean increase from nadir to AITD presentation was 355 cells/mL. AITD patients were more likely than controls (95% confidence interval, chi-square test) to be severely compromised at baseline (as defined by a CD4 count < 200 cells/mL or the presence of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]-defining diagnosis), and to experience greater CD4 increments following HAART. AITD may be a late manifestation of immune reconstitution in HIV-positive patients taking HAART, and immune dysregulation may be an important factor."
13832,0.005,1.0000,"The introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) led to a radical change in the natural history of HIV infection and of the associated neurological opportunistic infections. However, the mortality of central nervous system (CNS) complications and opportunistic infections is still high in untreated HIV-infected individuals or in patients unaware of their HIV infection. We describe the outcome of HIV-infected patients followed at a single center for AIDS-related neurological syndromes in the 16 years following the introduction of HAART, and compare the findings with those in patients admitted up to 1996. We have conducted a retrospective study of patients with HIV infection or AIDS (based on WHO criteria and classified according to the 1993 CDC criteria) admitted during 20 years (January 1992 to March 2012) to the Infectious Diseases Unit of the University of Verona for the presence of focal or widespread CNS lesion on neuroimaging. Clinical history, CD4 cell count, HIV-RNA level, neurological examination, imaging, cerebrospinal fluid examination and eventual cerebral biopsy results were reviewed as well as the final neurological diagnosis and the treatment. The survival time from the clinical onset of the neurologic syndrome to death was calculated for each patient who died. A statistical analysis was performed comparing data collected up to and after 1996, i.e., before and after HAART introduction. Among 1043 patients with HIV infection or AIDS admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of the University of Verona between January 1992 and March 2012, 114 had a CNS lesion. The following diseases were observed: neurotoxoplasmosis (NT), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), the severe form of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, cryptococcal encephalitis (CE) and lesions of undetermined origin. The follow-up period was 4 weeks to 72 months both in the pre-HAART and HAART era. Cerebral lesions were detected in 53/243 patients (21.8%) in the pre-HAART era and in 61/801 patients (7.6%) in the HAART era (p < 0.001). Most patients who developed a neurological complication in the HAART period (40/59, 67.8%) were untreated or did not know to be HIV-infected; in particular, 27.9% of patients with a CNS lesion in the HAART era were unaware of their HIV infection vs 13.2% in the pre-HAART era (p < 0.05). Some patients were not virologically suppressed (14/59, 23.7%) or were immunological non-responders (undetectable viral load, with CD4 count <200 cells/μL; 4/59, 6.8%). Other statistically significant data were the mean age at the onset of neurological complications (32.6 ± 5.4 years in the pre-HAART, 40.3 ± 9.5 in the HAART group, p < 0.001) and the mean CD4 cell count at the onset of illness (median of 38 cells/µL (2-215) in the pre-HAART, 77 cells/µL (2-752) in the HAART group; p < 0.001). In the HAART era a reduction of PCNSL and NT was observed. Our results, while confirming a decrease in the incidence of opportunistic infections of the CNS in the HAART era, show that late presentation of patients with HIV infection remains an important issue in our catchment area."
13780,0.005,1.0000,"Twenty-three children vertically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were studied for viremia during the first days of life. Nine had HIV-1 infection within the first week (early); 14 had HIV-1 first detected by day 11-90 (late). The groups had similar incidence and time of onset of symptomatic HIV-1 infection and survival. CD4 T cell percentages, rates of CD4 T cell attrition, quantitative cell-associated viremia, and p24 antigen concentrations were comparable. Children with peak antigen concentrations >100 pg/mL during the first 6 months (5 early, 6 late) fared worse than those with lower p24 levels. Thus, HIV-1-infected infants with detectable virus in the first few days of life do not have a worse prognosis than infants whose virus is detectable only later. Elevated p24 antigenemia during the first 6 months of life correlates strongly with poor clinical outcome and is independent of the time virus was first detected."
342,0.005,1.0000,"Individuals who present late with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection do not benefit from advances in drug therapies that delay their progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This paper describes these individuals and their subsequent survival and investigates predictors of late presentation. All AIDS diagnoses from 1992-1998 notified to the Victorian State AIDS Registry were included. Subjects were grouped as individuals diagnosed with AIDS within 8 weeks of a first positive HIV test (late presenters), or individuals for whom there was more than 8 weeks between AIDS diagnosis and first positive HIV test (non-late presenters). Of 1021 AIDS diagnoses notified, 24% were late presenters. Late presentation was associated with increasing age, being bisexual or heterosexual, being born in Asia, southern Europe or South America and being diagnosed at a hospital. Late presenters survived longer following AIDS diagnosis (P < 0.0001). This increased survival may indicate a positive response by drug naïve patients to antiretroviral therapies following AIDS diagnosis."
7895,0.005,1.0000,"The IgE synthesis is tightly controlled by a complex network of T and B cells. Because human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease associates T cell activation and depletion, polyclonal B cell activation, atopic symptoms, drug hypersensitivity, and autoimmune activity, we have evaluated IgE, as well as IgA, IgG, and IgM, in 315 HIV-seropositive individuals with or without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and compared the results to those of 100 HIV-seronegative subjects. IgE levels were higher in HIV-infected subjects as a whole, compared to levels in seronegative control subjects (p less than 0.05). This difference was particularly marked between patients with AIDS and control subjects (p less than 0.005). A strong relationship appeared between IgE and the immune status as assessed by CD4 cell counts (p less than 0.001 between IgE values in patients with CD4 less than 300 or greater than 300/microliters). In addition, we assessed the predictive value of IgE elevation over disease progression: in subjects with a CD4 count less than 300/microliters, the survival analysis disclosed a 24-month occurrence rate of AIDS of 83% in individuals with IgE greater than 150 KIU/L versus 44% in individuals with IgE less than 150 (p = 0.016). In subjects with an AIDS-related complex, IgE greater than 150 indicated a 100% rate of AIDS versus 9% in individuals with IgE less than 150 (p = 0.003). Thus, IgE levels appear to be a very discriminative marker between patients in late stages of HIV infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
15060,0.005,1.0000,"While the mean age of HIV/AIDS patients at first diagnosis is progressively rising, no updated epidemiological estimates, controlled clinical data, and randomized therapeutic trials, are available regarding clinical and laboratory response to antiretroviral therapy, safety of anti-HIV compounds and their associations, potential drug-drug interactions, short- and long-term toxicity, consequences on underlying disorders, or interactions with concomitant pharmacological regimens, in the elderly. The life expectancy of HIV-infected persons treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) now approximates that of general population matched for age, while also AIDS definition itself has lost most of its epidemiological and clinical significance, thanks to the immunoreconstitution resulting from the large-scale use of potent HAART regimens. The increased survival of HIV-infected patients, the late recognition of other subjects with missed or delayed diagnosis are responsible for a further expected rise of mean age of HIV-infected individuals, so that the patient population aged 60-70 years or more is expected to increase in coming years. Unfortunately, the majority of therapeutic trials involving antiretroviral therapy, as well as antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis for AIDS-related opportunistic complications, have advanced age and/or concurrent end-organ disorders among main exclusion criteria, or the design of these studies does not allow to extrapolate data regarding older patients, compared with younger ones. The very limited data presently available seem to demonstrate that HAART has a virological efficacy in the elderly comparable with that of younger adults, but immunological recovery is often slower and blunted, although several studies clearly demonstrated that thymic function is preserved until late adult age. When facing an HIV-infected patient with advanced age, health care givers have to pay careful attention to eventual end-organ disorders, all possible pharmacological interactions, overlapping toxicity due to concurrent drug administration. All these issues may significantly interfere with HAART activity, patient's adherence to prescribed medications, and frequency and severity of untoward effects. The guidelines of antiretroviral therapy and those of treatment and prophylaxis of AIDS-related diseases deserve appropriate updates, paralleling the increasing mean age of HIV-infected population. Moreover, epidemiological figures need an increased focus on older age, while clinical trials specifically targeting on the elderly population are mandatory to have reliable data on all aspects of HAART administration in advanced age."
4054,0.005,1.0000,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules regulate the cellular immune system and may be determinants of infant susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Molecular HLA typing for class I alleles was performed on infants followed in a Kenyan perinatal cohort. Early HIV-1 infection status was defined as infection occurring at birth or month 1, while late infection via breast milk was defined as first detection of HIV-1 after 1 month of age. Likelihood ratio tests based on a proportional hazards model adjusting for maternal CD4 T cell count and HIV-1 viral load at 32 weeks of gestation were used to test associations between infant allelic variation and incident HIV-1 infection. Among 433 infants, 76 (18%) were HIV-1 infected during 12 months of follow-up. HLA B*18 was associated with a significantly lower risk of early HIV-1 transmission [relative risk (RR) = 0.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.82], and none of the 24 breastfeeding infants expressing HLA B*18 who were uninfected at month 1 acquired HIV-1 late via breast milk. We observed a trend toward increased early HIV-1 acquisition for infants presenting HLA A*29 (RR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.0-3.8) and increased late HIV-1 acquisition via breast milk for both Cw*07 and Cw*08 (RR = 4.0; 95% CI 1.0-17.8 and RR = 7.2; 95% CI 1.2-37.3, respectively). HLA B*18 may protect breast-feeding infants against both early and late HIV-1 acquisition, a finding that could have implications for the design and monitoring of HIV-1 vaccines targeting cellular immune responses against HIV-1."
2263,0.005,1.0000,"Our objective is to analyse patients diagnosed with late-stage HIV infection in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) area. A prospective, observational study of all patients with an initial CD4 < 50 x 10(6)/L was carried out. Epidemiological, clinical and HAART-associated data were analysed. Survival rates were estimated and pairs of survival curves were compared. The statistical program used was SPSS (version 10). In all, 349 HIV-infected patients were diagnosed, 117 (33.5%) had late-stage disease, mean CD4 23.9 x 10(6)/L and mean viral load (VL) 5.38 log10. In 98 men, mean age 39.5 years, percentage of AIDS cases at their first attendance was 83.8%. The median follow-up period was 28 months and 27 died. Pneumocystis carinii was the most frequent cause of AIDS (24.4%) and death (18.5%). Survival rates at 12, 24 and 36 months were 95.6%, 85.8% and 72.4%. HAART was started in 82.1%. VLs < 50 copies/mL at one, two and three years of treatment were 55.2%, 55.7% and 58.0%. Resource utilization included 0.58 hospitalization/patient/year and 0.07 events/patient/year. HAART-related complications were as follows: 50% lipodystrophy, 9.7% hypertension, 22.2% hyperglycaemia, 26.4% hypercholesterolaemia, 31.9% hypertrygliceridaemia and 18.1% mixed hyperlipaemia. Over one-third of our patients have advanced HIV infection at diagnosis. However, the outcome is favourable, with a good immunovirological response and few new opportunistic events. HAART-related complications were frequent."
7970,0.005,1.0000,"R 82913, a tetrahydroimidazobenzodiazepinthione (TIBO) derivative with potent activity against human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) in vitro, was given to 22 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex in a dose-escalating pilot study. Doses of 10 to 300 mg administered daily by intravenous infusion were well tolerated for up to 50 weeks, with no haematological or biochemical evidence of toxicity. Mean OKT4 cell count rose slightly during the second month of treatment when higher steady-state plasma concentrations of the drug were achieved. Median p24 antigen concentration fell by 41% during the first month of therapy. When the rise in p24 antigen before therapy was compared to the fall during treatment, end-point analysis showed a significant difference (p less than 0.03). The combination of potent antiretroviral activity in vitro and the observed effect on HIV p24 antigen and absence of toxicity in vivo indicate that R 82913 and related TIBO derivatives merit further study in the treatment of retroviral infections."
15809,0.005,1.0000,"Tuberculosis (TB) has been the most common opportunistic infection and cause of mortality among HIV-infected patients, especially in resource-limited countries. Clinical manifestations of TB vary and depend on the degree of immunodeficiency. Sputum microscopy and culture with drug-susceptibility testing are recommended as a standard method for diagnosing active TB. TB-related mortality in HIV-infected patients is high especially during the first few months of treatment. Integrated therapy of both HIV and TB is feasible and efficient to control the diseases and yield better survival. Randomized clinical trials have shown that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) improves survival of HIV-infected patients with TB. A delay in initiating ART is common among patients referred from TB to HIV separate clinics and this delay may be associated with increased mortality risk. Integration of care for both HIV and TB using a single facility and a single healthcare provider to deliver care for both diseases is a successful model. For TB treatment, HIV-infected patients should receive at least the same regimens and duration of TB treatment as HIV-uninfected patients. Currently, a 2-month initial intensive phase of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by 4 months of continuation phase of isoniazid and rifampin is considered as the standard treatment of drug-susceptible TB. ART should be initiated in all HIV-infected patients with TB, irrespective of CD4 cell count. The optimal timing to initiate ART is within the first 8 weeks of starting antituberculous treatment and within the first 2 weeks for patients who have CD4 cell counts <50 cells/mm(3). Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART remains a first-line regimen for HIV-infected patients with TB in resource-limited settings. Although a standard dose of both efavirenz and nevirapine can be used, efavirenz is preferred because of more favorable treatment outcomes. In the settings where raltegravir is accessible, doubling the dose to 800 mg twice daily is recommended. Adverse reactions to either antituberculous or antiretroviral drugs, as well as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, are common in patients receiving integrated therapy. Early recognition and appropriate management of these consequences can reinforce the successful integrated therapy in HIV-infected patients with TB. "
75,0.005,1.0000,"Thalidomide is increasingly being used as adjuvant therapy for patients with mycobacterial and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The T-helper (Th)1 cytokine-Th2 cytokine balance critically determines the outcomes of these diseases. To obtain insight into the effect of thalidomide on the capacity of lymphocytes to produce Th1 and Th2 cytokines, six healthy volunteers received an oral dose (400 mg) of thalidomide. Before and at 3, 6, and 24 h after ingestion of thalidomide, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and stimulated for 24 h with the T-cell stimulant staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) or anti-CD3/CD28. In all six volunteers ingestion of thalidomide was associated with enhanced SEB- and anti-CD3/CD28-induced production of the Th1 cytokine gamma interferon (P < 0.05) and a decrease in the level of anti-CD3/CD28-induced interleukin-5 (IL-5) production (P < 0.05). The levels of IL-2 (Th1) and IL-4 (Th2) released remained unchanged. These changes were accompanied by an increase in the amount of IL-12p40 released by the PBMCs 6 h after ingestion of thalidomide (P < 0.05). Thus, a single oral dose of thalidomide causes a Th1-type response in healthy humans. This finding offers a potential explanation for the positive effect of thalidomide in patients with mycobacterial and HIV infections."
17425,0.005,1.0000,"Virus has been isolated from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of eight subjects with varying severity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and from the frontal lobe of one patient with AIDS. The five patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC) and AIDS also showed neurological/psychiatric complications. With the exception of one isolate from the CSF of an asymptomatic carrier, all isolates replicated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocytes after cell-free transmission. Isolates obtained from the blood of patients in late stages of HIV infection replicated in 3 (of 4) cases in H9 cells, whereas none of the blood isolates from patients in the early stages did so. The capacity of CSF isolates to replicate in H9 cells was low (only 2 of 12). Paired virus isolates from blood and CSF of the same patient could be distinguished by their replicative capacity in different cell lines, type of cytopathic effect, and protein profile as tested by radioimmunoprecipitation. The results indicate that variant viruses with distinct biological characteristics may be isolated from the blood and CSF of the same patient."
4666,0.005,1.0000,"The choice of an antiretroviral regimen can often impact on adherence, treatment satisfaction and therefore influence on clinical outcome. These concerns are particularly true in adolescents. In this setting, adherence is usually affected by multifactor events and biopsychosocial factors, which connect and changeover time. We evaluated the effect of a switch to a single-pill fixed-dose regimen on patient-reported outcomes, virologic and immunologic outcomes, and safety in a cohort of adolescents with perinatal HIV-1 infection. In addition, we evaluated the effect on low-level residual HIV-RNA. An open-label, non-randomised study was performed: 12 adolescents with a confirmed viremia <50 copies/mL treated with lamivudine or emtricitabine, tenofovir and efavirenz were switched to one-pill fixed-dose regimen of emtricitabine/tenofovir/efavirenz. At the end of follow-up, the new regimen was associated with improvements in treatment satisfaction, HIV-symptoms, whereas adherence remained high. No immunological or virological significative changes were observed. No side-effects were registered. Moreover, the low-level residual HIV-RNA was <3 copie/mL in all patients. One-pill fixed-dose regimen is an added value that favours adherence, reduces HIV-symptoms, improves patients' satisfaction and could better control of HIV-RNA in adolescents, too."
16657,0.005,1.0000,"Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) induces significant antiretroviral activities that affect the ability of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to infect and replicate in its principal target cells, CD4+ T cells and macrophages. A major endogenous source of IFN-alpha during any infection is the macrophage. Thus, macrophages have the potential to produce both IFN-alpha and HIV. In this study, we examined the production of IFN-alpha and other cytokines by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-treated cultured monocytes during HIV infection. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, IFN-omega, or IFN-beta were not detected nor was the mRNA expressed in either uninfected or HIV-infected monocytes. However, both uninfected and HIV-infected monocytes produced high levels of each of these cytokines after treatment with synthetic double-stranded RNA [poly(I).poly(C)]. Uninfected monocytes also produced high levels of IFN-alpha after treatment with poly(I).poly(C), Newcastle disease virus, or herpes simplex virus. In marked contrast to the preceding observations, HIV-infected monocytes produced little or no IFN-alpha before or after treatment with any of these agents. The absence of detectable IFN-alpha activity and mRNA in poly(I).poly(C)-treated HIV-infected monocytes was coincident with high levels of 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase and complete ablation of HIV gene expression. The antiviral activity induced by poly(I).poly(C) may be a direct effect of this synthetic double-stranded RNA or secondary to the low levels of IFN-beta and IFN-omega produced by infected cells. The markedly diminished capacity of HIV-infected monocytes to produce IFN-alpha may reflect a specific adaptive mechanism of virus to alter basic microbicidal functions of this cell. The inevitable result of this HIV-induced cytokine dysregulation is virus replication and persistence in mononuclear phagocytes."
17153,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-infected persons are at risk for HBV co-infection which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, protective immunity following HBV vaccination in HIV-infected persons is poor. This randomized, phase II, open-label study aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of 40 mcg HBV vaccine with or without 250 mcg GM-CSF administered at day 0, weeks 4 and 12. HIV-infected individuals >or=18 years of age, CD4 count >or=200 cells/mm(3), seronegative for HBV and HCV, and naïve to HBV vaccination were eligible. Primary endpoints were quantitative HBsAb titers and adverse events. The study enrolled 48 subjects. Median age and baseline CD4 were 41 years and 446 cells/mm(3), 37 were on ART, and 26 subjects had undetectable VL. Vaccination was well tolerated. Seven subjects in the GM-CSF arm reported transient grade >or=2 signs/symptoms (six grade 2, one grade 3), mostly aches and nausea. GM-CSF had no significant effect on VL or CD4. Four weeks after vaccination, 26 subjects (59%) developed a protective antibody response (HBsAb >or=10 mIU/mL; 52% in the GM-CSF arm and 65% in the control arm) without improved Ab titer in the GM-CSF vs. control arm (median 11 mIU/mL vs. 92 mIU/mL, respectively). Response was more frequent in those with CD4 >or=350 cells/mm(3) (64%) than with CD4 <350 cells/mm(3) (50%), though not statistically significant. GM-CSF as an adjuvant did not improve the Ab titer or the development of protective immunity to HBV vaccination in those receiving an accelerated vaccine schedule. Given the common routes of transmission for HIV and HBV, additional HBV vaccine research is warranted."
11880,0.005,1.0000,"This pilot study assessed the determinants of engagement in HIV care among Zambian patients new to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, and the effect of an intervention to increase medication adherence. Participants (n = 160) were randomized to a 3-month group or individual intervention utilizing a crossover design. Psychophysiological (depression, cognitive functioning, health status), social (social support, disclosure, stigma), structural factors (health care access, patient-provider communication), and treatment engagement (adherence to clinic visits and medication) were assessed. Participants initially receiving the group intervention improved their adherence, but gains were not maintained following crossover to the individual intervention. Increased social support and patient-provider communication and decreased concern about HIV medications predicted increased clinic attendance across both arms. Results suggest that early participation in a group intervention may promote increased adherence among patients new to ARV therapy, but long-term engagement in care may be sustained by both one-on-one and group interventions by health care staff."
6464,0.005,1.0000,"Collection of antiretroviral medication adherence data in the homes of HIV-infected people may have methodological advantages that can improve data quality. However, the feasibility of this approach has not been established. In addition, data on adherence, and its predictors, among HIV-infected women have been limited. Sixty-three HIV-positive women who were prescribed at least one antiretroviral drug in the last month were interviewed in their homes. A standard instrument was used to collect data on all antiretroviral medications prescribed and taken in the three days prior to the interview. Data were also collected on factors thought potentially to affect the ability to be adherent. The results of this study suggest that it is feasible to conduct home-based adherence research. Sixty-seven per cent reported taking all prescribed antiretroviral medication doses. One-third took a sub-optimal dose putting themselves at increased risk of treatment failure and the selection of resistant HIV strains. Unintentional reasons for missing doses were most commonly reported. An ability to describe the intended effect of antiretroviral therapy on HIV viral load was the best predictor of adherence. This finding is consistent with other research suggesting that adherence is associated with an understanding and belief in the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy."
19336,0.005,1.0000,"Factors associated with undetectable viral load (<80 copies/ml) were investigated among non-pregnant adults in antiretroviral treatment in a specialized service for HIV/AIDS in Southern Brazil. Use of antiretrovirals was investigated in two interviews (one month interval). Clinical data were collected from the clinical records; viral load previous to adherence measurement was defined the viral load previous to the first interview; the final viral load, the viral load subsequent to the second interview (interval between measures approximately 6 months). Undetectable final viral load occurred in 48% of the patients and was positively associated with levels of treatment adherence (p<0.001), being 19% for less than 60% of adherence and about 60% for adherence greater than 80%. In the multivariate model, the odds of undetectable final viral load was four times greater for 80-94% and > or =95% of adherence (CI 95% 1,80-13,28; CI 95% 1,73-9,53), compared with less than 60% adherence; it was greater for less than 6 months in treatment (OR = 3.37; CI 95% 1.09-10.46); and smaller for viral load previous to adherence measurement 5.2 log10 (OR = 0.19; CI95% 0.06-0.58), adjusted for these variables and sex, age, clinical status, current immune status, group of drugs and interval between the two measurements of viral load. The crude odds were lower for age 16-24 years and use of Nucleoside Analog Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors only, but these effects were not significant in the multivariate model. There was no evidence of effect of sex, clinical status, current immune status, and changes in treatment regimen. Treatment adherence gave the largest effect. Motivational interventions directed at adherence may improve treatment effectiveness."
12124,0.005,1.0000,"Unhygienic blood collection caused an outbreak of HIV-1 and HCV infections among blood donors in rural areas in Henan province, China. Partial HIV-1 pol and HCV NS5b gene sequences were obtained from 97 persons infected with HIV-1 to determine the efficacy of treatment, the prevalence of drug-resistant mutations, and the impact of HCV infection on disease progression of infection with HIV-1. After antiretroviral therapy, 60 out of 97 HIV-1-infected blood donors had their HIV-1 RNA levels reduced to an undetectable level. Drug-resistant mutations to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were detected in one-third of treatment failure patients, with K103N as the most frequent mutation. Drug-resistant mutations were not detected in the other two-thirds of treatment-failure patients, suggesting a poor adherence to the treatment. The majority of HIV-1-infected patients (91.8%) were also infected with HCV. Sequence analysis showed that they were infected with HCV subtype 1b (47.5%) or 2a (52.5%). HCV viral loads were significantly higher in patients infected with subtype 2a than in patients infected with HCV subtype 1b, although no differences in HIV-1 viral loads and CD4(+)T cell counts was observed between the two subtypes. These results suggest that improved adherence and treatment regimens will be critical to effectively treat HIV-1 and HCV-coinfected patients in resource-limited areas."
2664,0.005,1.0000,"While numerous studies examine methamphetamine use and associated risky sexual behaviors in HIV-uninfected individuals, few studies have surveyed HIV-infected individuals in the health care setting. To assess the frequency and trends of methamphetamine use, sexual activity, injection drug use, patient-provider communication, and medication adherence among HIV-infected persons in care, we administered a one-page anonymous survey in 2004 and 2006. The survey was conducted at the two University of California, San Francisco outpatient HIV clinics: at Moffitt Hospital (Moffitt), serving primarily privately insured patients, and at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), a county hospital serving primarily patients who are uninsured or publicly insured. In 2006, 39% of men who have sex with men (MSM), 33% of heterosexual men, and 11% of women reported methamphetamine use in the prior 12 months. Methamphetamine use was significantly associated with an increased number of sex partners among MSM and heterosexual men, and poor anti-retroviral medication adherence. Among MSM, methamphetamine use was more common at the SFGH clinic. Between 2004 and 2006, reported methamphetamine use in the last 12 months decreased among MSM at Moffitt (38 to 20%, p<0.01), but increased at SFGH (40 to 50%, p<0.05). Among methamphetamine users we found a high frequency of injection of methamphetamine, which increased at SFGH from 38 to 55%, p<0.05. Patient-provider communication regarding methamphetamine use has increased from 2004 to 2006 but no significant change has been found for providers asking patients about sexual activity. Overall, we found methamphetamine use to be common among HIV-infected patients in care, and associated with an increased number of sex partners, a high frequency of injection drug use, and poor adherence to anti-retroviral medications. These findings support the need for improved screening and clinic-based interventions to reduce and treat methamphetamine abuse and associated high risk sexual behaviors."
18409,0.005,1.0000,"Zidovudine is associated with hematologic toxicity and may also impair the rapidly proliferating intestinal epithelium. However, patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection receiving zidovudine gain body weight, indicating improved absorptive function. In the present study, 33 HIV-infected patients with gastrointestinal symptoms who were undergoing duodenoscopy and who had no detectable secondary intestinal pathogens were investigated; 12 of them received zidovudine. HIV antigen p24 was detected in duodenal biopsy specimens by immunohistology in 3 of 12 patients with zidovudine treatment and in 10 of 21 patients without zidovudine treatment. Morphometry of duodenal specimens showed reduced villus surface area (P less than 0.05) without crypt hyperplasia independent of zidovudine therapy and reduced numbers of crypt mitoses in patients with mucosal HIV infection (P less than 0.001) compared with controls. In the duodenal brush border, patients with mucosal HIV infection (P = 0.006) and patients without zidovudine treatment (P = 0.009) had absent lactase/beta-glucosidase activity more frequently than controls, and all HIV-infected patients (P less than 0.025) except zidovudine recipients had decreased alkaline phosphatase activity compared with controls. These findings show a hyporegenerative atrophy of the small intestine and enterocyte dysmaturation associated with mucosal HIV infection. Improved enterocyte maturation, indicated by increased brush border enzyme activity, may contribute to the clinical benefit of HIV-infected patients from zidovudine therapy."
7720,0.005,1.0000,"Current guidelines recommend hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing for HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) with ongoing risk behaviour, without specifying the type of risk behaviour. We developed and validated the HCV-MOSAIC risk score to assist HCV testing in HIV-infected MSM. The risk score consisted of six self-reported risk factors identified using multivariable logistic regression using data from the Dutch MOSAIC study (n = 213, 2009-2013). Area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, post-test-probability-of-disease and diagnostic gain were calculated. The risk score was validated in case-control studies from Belgium (n = 142, 2010-2013) and the United Kingdom (n = 190, 2003-2005) and in cross-sectional surveys at a Dutch sexually transmitted infections clinic (n = 284, 2007-2009). The AUC was 0.82; sensitivity 78.0% and specificity 78.6%. In the validation studies sensitivity ranged from 73.1% to 100% and specificity from 56.2% to 65.6%. The post-test-probability-of-disease ranged from 5.9% to 20.0% given acute HCV prevalence of 1.7% to 6.4%, yielding a diagnostic gain of 4.2% to 13.6%. The HCV-MOSAIC risk score can successfully identify HIV-infected MSM at risk for acute HCV infection. It could be a promising tool to improve HCV testing strategies in various settings."
10754,0.005,1.0000,"Immunotherapy in patients with HIV-1 infection aims to restore and broaden immunological competence, reduce viral load and thereby permit longer periods without combined antiretroviral treatment (cART). Twelve HIV-1-infected patients on cART were immunized on the skin with DNA plasmids containing genes of several HIV-1 subtypes with or without the addition of hydroxyurea (HU), or with placebo. The mean net gain of HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses were higher and broader in the HIV DNA vaccine groups compared to non-vaccinated individuals (p<0.05). The vaccine-induced immune responses per se had no direct effect on viral replication. In all patients combined, including placebo, the viral set point after a final structured therapy interruption (STI) was lower than prior to initiation of cART (p=0.003). Nadir CD4 levels appeared to strongly influence the post-STI viral titers. After the sixth immunization or placebo, patients could stay off cART for a median time of 15 months. The study shows that HIV DNA immunization induces broader and higher magnitudes of HIV-specific immune responses compared to structured therapy interruptions alone. Although compromised by small numbers of patients, the study also demonstrates that well-monitored STI may safely function as an immunological read out of HIV vaccine efficacy."
3993,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) persistence is facilitated by exhaustion of CD8 T cells that express the inhibitory receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). Improvement of the HBV-specific T cell function has been obtained in vitro by inhibiting the PD-1/PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) interaction. In this study, we examined whether in vivo blockade of the PD-1 pathway enhances virus-specific T cell immunity and leads to the resolution of chronic hepadnaviral infection in the woodchuck model. The woodchuck PD-1 was first cloned, characterized, and its expression patterns on T cells from woodchucks with acute or chronic woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection were investigated. Woodchucks chronically infected with WHV received a combination therapy with nucleoside analogue entecavir (ETV), therapeutic DNA vaccination and woodchuck PD-L1 antibody treatment. The gain of T cell function and the suppression of WHV replication by this therapy were evaluated. We could show that PD-1 expression on CD8 T cells was correlated with WHV viral loads during WHV infection. ETV treatment significantly decreased PD-1 expression on CD8 T cells in chronic carriers. In vivo blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway on CD8 T cells, in combination with ETV treatment and DNA vaccination, potently enhanced the function of virus-specific T cells. Moreover, the combination therapy potently suppressed WHV replication, leading to sustained immunological control of viral infection, anti-WHs antibody development and complete viral clearance in some woodchucks. Our results provide a new approach to improve T cell function in chronic hepatitis B infection, which may be used to design new immunotherapeutic strategies in patients. "
1687,0.005,1.0000,"Increasing prevalence of thyroid function abnormality has been reported in HIV-infected patients. We aim to evaluate the prevalence and assess risk factors of thyroid dysfunction in Thai HIV-infected patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted. Serum thyroid hormone concentrations (FT4, FT3, and TSH) and thyroid autoantibodies (TgAb and TPOAb) were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. A total of 200 HIV-infected outpatients were included. Ninety-seven patients (48.5%) were men (mean age of 36.3 +/- 8.3 years). Duration of HIV infection was 49.6 +/- 35.1 months and 53% had previous opportunistic infections (OI). Mean CD4 cell count was 340.6 +/- 173.1 cells/mm(3). Of these, 167 patients (83.5%) received antiretroviral therapy (ARV). Abnormal thyroid function test was detected in 32 patients (16%). Twenty-seven patients (13.5%) had decreased thyroid function (primary hypothyroidism 3, subclinical hypothyroidism 12, and low FT4 with low or normal TSH 12) whereas 5 patients had increased thyroid function (overt hyperthyroidism 1, subclinical hyperthyroidism 1, and isolated high FT3 3). None had clinical features of thyroid hormone dysfunction. Thirteen patients (6.5%) had thyroid antibody positive. Patients who received ARV had higher mean FT3 levels than those who were naïve to ARV (p = 0.017). History of previous OI was found to be an independently significant risk factor for decreased thyroid function with the odds ratio of 3.28 (95% CI =1.183-9.099; p = 0.022). Hypothyroidism was common among Thai HIV-infected patients, especially in those who had history of previous OI. It is therefore suggested that screening and/or monitoring of thyroid hormone in HIV-infected patients should be considered."

The first patient was a 45-year-old Hispanic man with well-suppressed HIV RNA who had a positive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) titer of 1:128. His cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) revealed a positive VDRL titer of 1:16, and an elevated white blood cell count of 96 cells/mm(3) and protein level of 89 mg/dl. He received high-dose doxycycline 200 mg twice/day for 28 days. Two months later, his CSF VDRL titer, white blood cell count, and protein level decreased to 1:4, 5 cells/mm(3), and 60 mg/dl, respectively. The second patient was a 37-year-old Caucasian man with complications from acquired immunodeficiency disease. A routine VDRL titer was found to be 1:64. Although the CSF VDRL was nonreactive, both his white blood cell count and protein level were elevated at 29 cells/mm(3) and 46 mg/dl, respectively. High-dose doxycycline 200 mg twice/day was prescribed for 28 days. Three months later, the patient's VDRL titer decreased to 1:2; his CSF white blood cell count decreased significantly to 1 cell/mm(3), and his protein level was within normal limits. Clinicians should be aware that an extended course of high-dose, oral doxycycline may be an effective and safe alternative regimen to intravenous or intramuscular penicillin, without requiring hospitalization or home health care, for the treatment of neurosyphilis in HIV-infected patients. Prospective trials are needed to assess the long-term efficacy oral doxycycline for neurosyphilis."
13109,0.005,1.0000,"The present study was designed to investigate the status of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and associated risk factors among Egyptian military recruits. The impact of HCV infection on liver function was also assessed. The sera of 726 military recruits were tested for HCV antibodies using second generation ELISA technique (Ortho). The overall prevalence was 330.4%. Considering the presence of hepatitis B and/or schistosomiasis infection, HCV antibodies were detected in 30.0% of HBsAg carriers, 36.8% of bilharzial patients and 48.8% of those with concomitant infections. Among individuals without schistosomiasis or HBV infection, the rate decreased to 22.5% positive with HCV. The present study indicated that parenteral exposure to the virus might be the most important route for acquiring infection, while blood transfusion had a very minor role. The study of the impact of HCV on liver functions revealed that a single infection with HCV only was associated with almost normal liver function tests. However, infection with more than one hepatitis virus revealed a greater impact on the liver function. Morbidity also increased when schistosomiasis infection was superimposed."

In this study, real-time PCR and in situ hybridization was used to test for the presence of genomic and antigenomic HCV-RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 109 hemodialysis patients with abnormal levels of liver enzymes. Occult HCV infection, determined by the presence of genomic HCV-RNA, was found in 45% of the patients; 53% of these patients had ongoing HCV replication, indicated by the presence of antigenomic HCV-RNA. Patients with occult HCV infection had spent a significantly longer time on hemodialysis and had significantly higher mean alanine aminotransferase levels during the 6 mo before study entry. Logistic regression analysis revealed that mortality was associated with age >60 yr (odds ratio 3.30; 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 10.33) and the presence of occult HCV infection (odds ratio 3.84; 95% confidence interval 1.29 to 11.43). In conclusion, the prevalence of occult HCV infection is high among hemodialysis patients with persistently abnormal values of liver enzymes of unknown cause. The clinical significance of occult HCV infection in these patients requires further study."
4637,0.005,1.0000,"The virion-associated protein of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), Vpr, is a small protein with 96 amino acid residues that has the ability to modulate transcription of HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter activity and affects several cellular functions. In this study we have employed molecular approaches to further investigate the mechanism by which Vpr exerts its regulatory effect upon the LTR. We show that by structural and functional interaction with Tat, a potent viral regulatory protein, Vpr synergistically enhances the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 LTR. Because Tat utilizes cyclin T1 and its partner, CDK9 to elevate the level of transcription from the LTR, we examined the cooperativity between Vpr, Tat, and cyclin T1/CDK9 on viral gene transcription. Results from co-transfection studies indicated superactivation of LTR by Tat and cyclin T1/CDK9 in the presence of wild type Vpr. This activation was not observed with the R73S mutant of Vpr, which contains arginine to serine transition at residue 73. Interestingly, expression of R73S mutant in cells exerts a negative effect on the observed superactivation of the LTR by Tat, cyclin T1/CDK9, and wild type Vpr. Results from protein-protein interaction studies indicated that Vpr is associated with both Tat and cyclin T1 in cells expressing these proteins. Use of deletion mutant proteins in binding studies revealed that the binding sites for Tat and Vpr within cyclin T1 are distinct and that association of these two viral proteins with cyclin T1 is independent from each other. These observations suggest a working model on the cooperative interaction of Vpr with viral and cellular proteins and its involvement in control of viral gene transcription and replication. Moreover identification of R73S mutant of Vpr provides a new therapeutic avenue for controlling HIV-1 gene transcription and replication in the infected cells."
12451,0.005,1.0000,"Vaccination for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) remains an elusive goal. Whether an unsuccessful vaccine might not only fail to provoke detectable immune responses but also could actually interfere with subsequent natural immunity upon HIV-1 infection is unknown. We performed detailed assessment of an HIV-1 gag DNA vaccine recipient (subject 00015) who was previously uninfected but sustained HIV-1 infection before completing a vaccination trial and another contemporaneously acutely infected individual (subject 00016) with the same strain of HIV-1. Subject 00015 received the vaccine at weeks 0, 4, and 8 and was found to have been acutely HIV-1 infected around the time of the third vaccination. Subject 00016 was a previously HIV-1-seronegative sexual contact who had symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection approximately 2 weeks earlier than subject 00015 and demonstrated subsequent seroconversion. Both individuals reached an unusually low level of chronic viremia (<1,000 copies/ml) without treatment. Subject 00015 had no detectable HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses until a borderline response was noted at the time of the third vaccination. The magnitude and breadth of Gag-specific CTL responses in subject 00015 were similar to those of subject 00016 during early chronic infection. Viral sequences from gag, pol, and nef confirmed the common source of HIV-1 between these individuals. The diversity and divergence of sequences in subjects 00015 and 00016 were similar, indicating similar immune pressure on these proteins (including Gag). As a whole, the data suggested that while the gag DNA vaccine did not prime detectable early CTL responses in subject 00015, vaccination did not appreciably impair his ability to contain viremia at levels similar to those in subject 00016."
14780,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether HIV-1 infected patients in our community were more susceptible to Entamoeba histolytica and Entamoeba dispar infection than non-HIV-infected individuals. The prevalence and frequency of invasive amebiasis was determined in 203 HIV+/AIDS subjects and 140 close relatives or sexual partners, all of whom were HIV-. Anti-E. histolytica antibodies (IgG, IgA) were assessed as indicators of E. histolytica invasive infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for the characterization of the Entamoeba species. The prevalence estimated with PCR data showed that E. histolytica infection was more common in the HIV+/AIDS group (25.32%), than in HIV- contacts (18.46%). E. histolytica + E. dispar infection was more frequent in HIV+/AIDS patients (13.3%), than in HIV- contacts (0.7%). E. histolytica and/or E. dispar infection was highly prevalent in HIV+/AIDS patients (34.1%) without evidence of recent or current invasive disease. Contacts of HIV+/AIDS patients who were infected with E. histolytica were asymptomatic cyst passers. Our results suggest that E. histolytica strains prevalent in the studied community appear to be of low pathogenic potential."
3827,0.005,1.0000,"Our objective was to characterize the effect of zidovudine therapy on AIDS dementia complex (dementia) free survival among HIV-infected men and women in a population-based cohort with free access to antiretroviral therapy in the province of British Columbia. Time to diagnosis of dementia among individuals was examined on the basis of zidovudine duration, CD4+ cell count at first treatment, gender, and transmission group [men having sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users (IDU), heterosexuals]. We restricted the analysis to subjects with CD4+ cells counts within 12 months prior to treatment start date. Among 641 participants eligible for analysis, median duration of follow-up was 3.6 years, under which 86 (9.3%) events of dementia occurred. Participants were less likely to develop dementia with: increased zidovudine exposure (OR=0.26, 95% CI: 0.14-0.49), at least 260 CD4+ cells/mm3 (median) (OR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.34-0.78), and MSM risk group (OR=0.57, 95% CI: 0.35-0.94). Those infected through heterosexual contact had an increased risk (RR=2.04, 95% CI: 1.02-4.07). Using Cox's proportional hazards model, controlling for CD4+ cell count at treatment start date, independent predictors of dementia-free survival were: duration of zidovudine (OR=0.28, 95% CI: 0.15-0.52) and MSM transmission group (OR=0.61, 95% CI: 0.37-1.00). In this observational treatment cohort, factors associated with dementia-free survival include duration of zidovudine (AZT) therapy and MSM transmission group. It is not clear from these data whether the AZT protective effect is exclusive to this agent or whether other therapies might offer a similar protective effect."
2519,0.005,1.0000,"Resting CD4+ T-cell populations from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals include cells with integrated HIV-1 DNA. In individuals showing suppression of viremia during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), resting CD4+ T-cell populations do not produce virus without cellular activation. To determine whether the nonproductive nature of the infection in resting CD4+ T cells is due to retroviral integration into chromosomal regions that are repressive for transcription, we used inverse PCR to characterize the HIV-1 integration sites in vivo in resting CD4+ T cells from patients on HAART. Of 74 integration sites from 16 patients, 93% resided within transcription units, usually within introns. Integration was random with respect to transcriptional orientation relative to the host gene and with respect to position within the host gene. Of integration sites within well-characterized genes, 91% (51 of 56) were in genes that were actively expressed in resting CD4+ T cells, as directly demonstrated by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). These results predict that HIV-1 sequences may be included in the primary transcripts of host genes as part of rapidly degraded introns. RT-PCR experiments confirmed the presence of HIV-1 sequences within transcripts initiating upstream of the HIV-1 transcription start site. Taken together, these results demonstrate that HIV-1 genomes reside within actively transcribed host genes in resting CD4+ T cells in vivo."
6454,0.005,1.0000,"Several recent studies have indicated that patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exhibit a beneficial effect of co-infection with GB virus C (GBV-C). The benefit is demonstrated by slower progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and prolonged survival time after the development of AIDS. In some but not all studies, a significant association between GBV-C/HIV co-infection and increased CD4(+) cell counts has been reported. To understand further the possible role that GBV-C might play in the reduced morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients, we sought to examine the presence of different GBV-C genotypes in a cohort of co-infected patients. PCR products derived from the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) and the second envelope gene (E2) were sequenced directly and genotyped by phylogenetic analysis. While 5'-UTR analysis delineated the major type, analysis of the complete E2 gene was required for identification of group 2 subtypes, designated 2a and 2b. Among 35 patients tested, GBV-C genotype was determined for 33: two patients were infected with genotype 1, 12 with type 2a, and 19 with type 2b. Clinical data were available for 25 genotyped patients: one infected with genotype 1, nine with genotype 2a, and 15 with type 2b. CD4 cell counts tended to be lower in patients infected with genotype 2a compared with those with genotype 2b (310 +/- 136 vs 430 +/- 199, P = 0.054). Additional studies with larger cohorts from separate geographical regions are needed to determine whether a particular GBV-C genotype is associated with reduced morbidity or mortality among HIV co-infected patients."
15782,0.005,1.0000,"The association of prolonged rituximab therapy and hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and the role of lamivudine prophylaxis remain undefined. The prevalence and mortality of HBV reactivation in HBsAg-positive patients with DLBCL undergoing rituximab-based treatment, who received prophylactic treatment with or without lamivudine, were retrospectively analyzed. From January 2003 to December 2009, there were 50 patients enrolled in the study, among of which 30 received the prophylactic treatment of lamivudine and 20 without prophylactic treatment of lamivudine. Among of the 50 patients, seven patients received further rituximab maintenance, once every 3 months for 2 years. Compared with lamivudine treatment group, it showed that there was significantly higher prevalence of HBV reactivation (60.0% vs 13.3%, P = .001), severe hepatitis (45.0% vs 6.7%, P = .004), and mortality (25.0% vs 3.3%, P = .032) in non-lamivudine prophylactic group; however, there was no statistically significant difference in the HBV DNA levels at reactivation (3.94 × 10(6) vs 8.30 × 10(5) copies/ml, P = .47) and the time from first dose of rituximab to HBV reactivation(207 vs 386 days, P = .28). For patients undergoing further rituximab maintanence treatment, the prevalence and mortality of HBV reactivation were 71.4 and 28.6%, respectively. The prevalence and mortality of HBV reactivation are 66.7% vs 75.0% (P = 1.00) and 0 vs 50.0% (P = .43) in lamivudine prophylactic and non-lamivudine prophylactic groups, respectively. The effect of lamivudine prophylaxis on preventing HBV reactivation was found to be less in patients undergoing longer duration of rituximab treatment. A longer duration of rituximab treatment contributed to higher morbidity and mortality of HBV reactivation in HbsAg-positive patients with DLBCL. Further study is warranted for the optimal management of hepatitis caused by HBV reactivation."
5275,0.005,1.0000,"A study was conducted in Lima, Peru to determine if patients with Strongyloides hyperinfection had human T cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-I) infection. The study included patients with Strongyloides hyperinfection and a control group consisted of sex- and age-matched asymptomatic healthy individuals whose stools were negative for Strongyloides. A third group included patients with intestinal strongyloidiasis. Sera from each study subject were tested for HTLV-1/2I by an ELISA and Western blot. The HLTV-1 infection rates (85.7%, 18 of 21) were significantly (P < 0.001) associated with Strongyloides hyperinfection compared with the control group (4.7%, 1 of 21). The HTLV-1 rate (10%, 6 of 62) for patients with intestinal strongyloidiasis was significantly (P < 0.001) lower than patients with Strongyloides hyperinfection, but did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) from the control group. The association of HTLV-1 infection was observed among 17 of 19 patients more than 20 years of age and one of two younger patients. None had HTLV-2 infection. In conclusion, Strongyloides hyperinfection among Peruvian patients was highly associated with HTLV-1 infection."

Serum HIV antigen rose in only 1 patient and declined significantly in 13 (to below cut-off values in 9). In the 1 subject from whom HIV antigen positive cerebrospinal fluid was obtained, the fluid was antigen negative after 12 weeks of treatment. Acyclovir treatment alone or in addition did not seem to influence serum antigen levels. In 7 untreated men serum antigen levels rose or remained stable during follow-up. CD4+ cell counts increased in 14/18 treated subjects and 1/7 untreated subjects. No disease progression was observed in either group. Regression of enlarged lymph nodes was seen in the zidovudine-treated subjects. Adverse reactions to the study drugs were infrequent and mild.

Additional tests were used to better characterize the type of cognitive changes with a specific reference to frontal lobe function. The neuropsychological evaluation confirmed the subcortical pattern of cognitive dysfunction. CSF and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were significantly correlated. No correlation was detected with either blood or CSF RNA levels and the global cognitive status, but when stratified in three cognitive subgroups, higher CSF HIV-1 RNA levels were observed in the more cognitively impaired subjects. Our results provide further evidence that plasma and CSF HIV-1 RNA level cannot be used as a reliable diagnostic marker for HIV-1 associated cognitive disorders. Only longitudinal studies will determine whether a high CSF HIV-1 level could be a risk factor for HIV-1 dementia."

Two asymptomatic HIV-1 seropositive persons and one individual with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy were negative by both techniques. All of four patients with overt neurological symptoms, but also 20 of 24 patients without such symptoms were PCR positive.

Zidovudine (AZT, 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine), didanosine (ddI, 2',3'-dideoxyinosine), and recombinant interferon-alpha A (rIFN-alpha A) were evaluated in two-drug regimens against replication of AZT-resistant HIV-1 in vitro. AZT-sensitive and AZT-resistant isolate pairs derived from two individuals before and after extended AZT monotherapy were studied. Drug interactions using peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with HIV-1 were evaluated mathematically. Synergistic interactions were seen among AZT, ddI, and rIFN-alpha A in two-drug regimens against AZT-resistant HIV-1 in vitro, even when AZT was included in the treatment regimen. Mixtures of wild-type and mutant reverse transcriptase genes were found in one of the late-AZT therapy isolates, suggesting that the mechanism of synergy of AZT-containing regimens may involve inhibition of AZT-sensitive viruses in the viral pool. These studies suggest that AZT may be useful in drug combination regimens, even when AZT-resistant viruses are isolated in vitro."
775,0.005,1.0000,"In this update, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all patients infected by type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). The strength and grade of the recommendation varies with clinical circumstances, number of CD4 cells, comorbid conditions and prevention of transmission of HIV. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable plasma viral load. Initial ART should always comprise a combination of 3 drugs, including 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a third drug from a different family (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, protease inhibitor, or integrase inhibitor). This update presents the causes and criteria for switching ART in patients with undetectable plasma viral load and in cases of virological failure. An update is also provided for the specific criteria for ART in special situations (acute infection, HIV-2 infection, and pregnancy) and with comorbid conditions (tuberculosis or other opportunistic infections, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer).

2040,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to marked decreases in morbidity and mortality rates among HIV-1-positive patients; however, immune recovery is not complete. Although dendritic cells (DCs) were shown to be involved in HIV-1 pathogenesis, few studies have investigated the effect of ART on DCs. We have analyzed the effect of ART on numerical distribution, expression of chemokine receptors, and ex vivo production of inflammatory cytokines by peripheral blood (PB) monocytes and DCs in a cohort of chronically infected HIV-1-positive patients. Patients were tested before therapy and at weeks +2, +4, +8, +12, and +52 after starting ART.Our results show an incomplete T-cell immune reconstitution in chronically infected patients who had undetectable plasma viremia while taking ART for 1 year. This was associated with persistent abnormalities at week +52 of ART, corresponding to increased numbers of CD16 DCs and monocytes, as well as altered expression of CXC chemokine receptors, in the form of increased CXCR1 expression on monocytes and decreased reactivity for CXCR2 and/or CXCR4 on myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs. In addition, an abnormally high spontaneous ex vivo secretion of inflammatory cytokines by CD16 DCs and monocytes was still detected after 1 year of ART. These abnormalities were especially pronounced in patients with less than 200 CD4 T cells/microL, which could be related to the persistence of undetected viral replication and sustained immune activation."

High incidence of early post-transplant complications such as acute rejection has been observed. A multicenter study including HIV-infected patients who underwent KT in Spain, from 2001 to 2011, was performed. The study population included 108 recipients, 36 HIV-infected, and 72 matched HIV-negative KT recipients. HIV-infected recipients developed more delayed graft function (DGF) (52% vs. 21%, P < 0.001). One- and 3-year graft survival was 91.6% and 86.2% in HIV-infected patients, and 97.1% and 94.7% in HIV-negative patients (P = 0.052). In two-variate Cox analysis, HIV infection was not a predictor of graft loss after adjusting for time on dialysis, acute rejection, and DGF. Multivariate analysis for DGF revealed HIV-positive status as independent risk factor. We analyzed the evolution of immunosuppressive and antiretroviral therapy (ART). In HIV-infected patients tacrolimus trough levels were very high in the first week and significantly lower in the second week post-transplant (P = 0.042). Post-transplant ART was significantly changed: protease inhibitors use decreased (P = 0.034) and integrase inhibitor use increased (P < 0.001). DGF is another frequent early complication in HIV-infected recipients that can affect graft survival. Strategies to prevent DGF and antiretroviral regimes with less drug interactions could improve outcomes."

The changes were compared to those reported for HIV-1 subtype B, revealing striking similarities in selected phenotype and amino acids independent of differences in the RT backbone sequences that constantly distinguish the two subtypes. Particularly, identical amino acid substitutions were present simultaneously at four different positions (D67N, K70R, T215F, and K219Q) for high-level AZT resistance. These data suggest that HIV-1 subtypes E and B evolve convergently at the phenotypic and amino acid levels when the nucleoside analogue RT inhibitors act as selective forces."

The men were followed semiannually for up to 6.5 years between 1984 and 1990. A total of 9,735 person-semesters of observations were available for analysis. A Markov-type autoregressive model, adjusting for previous body mass index, was used to predict the change in body mass index over each person-semester. Overall, the cohort was gaining weight. An asymptomatic participant 1.8 m in height whose CD4+ cell count was > 750/microliters gained a mean of 0.5 kg each person-semester. In bivariate autoregressive models, diarrhea, fever, oral thrush, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and CD4+ lymphocyte counts of < 100 and 100-199 cells/microliters were all associated with a significant decrease in body mass index. A significant inverse association was also found between change in body mass index and lymphadenopathy and herpes zoster, but when the intercept coefficient was added, no overall decrease in body mass index was seen in these models. In a final multivariate model, diarrhea was less strongly associated with a change in body mass index (p = 0.057), although AIDS (p = 0.009), fever (p = 0.006), thrush (p = 0.002), and a CD4+ lymphocyte count of < 100 cells/microliters (p < 0.001) all remained independently associated with a decrease in body mass index. Lymphadenopathy and a CD4+ lymphocyte count of 100-199 cells/microliters were also significant covariates in the final model, but neither of the beta coefficients exceeded that of the intercept, indicating that they were not independently associated with a decrease in body mass index. These findings suggest that the importance of diarrhea as a cause of HIV-related weight loss may have been over-estimated in previous clinic-based studies. AIDS and nonspecific markers of progression (fever, thrush, and a CD4+ count of < 100 cells/microliters) were the best predictors of weight loss during a semester."

19342,0.005,1.0000,"The data on the risk of hypertension in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, particularly in those with lipodystrophy, are controversial. The authors assessed the impact of lipodystrophy on hypertension in a cohort of HIV-infected adults receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. This was a cross-sectional study in which lipodystrophy (clinically and fat mass ratio [FMR]-defined), blood pressure, and body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography) were evaluated in 368 HIV adults. The prevalence of hypertension in HIV patients with or without clinically or FMR-defined lipodystrophy was similar (with clinical lipodystrophy 35.3% vs without 32.9%, not significant; with FMR lipodystrophy 41.7% vs without 32.2%, not significant). When HIV-infected patients were classified into 4 categories of fat distribution (based on the presence or absence of lipoatrophy and abdominal prominence), isolated lipoatrophy was not significantly associated with hypertension, but patients with isolated central fat accumulation and mixed forms of lipodystrophy had a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension. Hypertensive HIV patients had significantly higher total fat, central, and central/peripheral fat mass ratio than normotensive ones. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, and body mass index, hypertension remains significantly associated with central/peripheral fat mass ratio (odds ratio, 1.258; 95% confidence interval, 1.008-1.569). Hypertension was not more prevalent in lipodystrophic HIV-infected patients, but was significantly associated with central/peripheral fat mass ratio."

This study evaluated whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug penetration and CSF virological suppression influence the extent of neuropsychological (NP) improvement during ART. Overall performance on a battery of NP tests administered at baseline and follow-up (median 15 weeks) was computed by using the global deficit score (GDS) methods in 31 cognitively impaired, HIV-infected individuals who began new ART regimens. Virological suppression (attaining undetectable viral load by RT-PCR at follow-up) was assessed separately for plasma and CSF. Subjects on regimens containing greater numbers of CSF-penetrating drugs showed significantly greater reduction in CSF viral load. Subjects attaining CSF virological suppression demonstrated greater GDS improvement than those who did not (median GDS change, 0.62 vs 0.23; p = 0.01). A similar trend for plasma did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.053). NP improvement was greater in ART-naive versus treatment-experienced subjects. In a multivariate model (overall p = 0.0008), significant, independent predictors of GDS reduction were CSF HIV RNA suppression, baseline antiretroviral history, and their interaction. Including CSF-penetrating drugs in the ART regimen and monitoring CSF viral load may be indicated for individuals with HIV-associated cognitive impairment."
5379,0.005,1.0000,"Paediatric Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection (HIV) nowadays is a chronic disease with an excellent long term prognosis, but lifelong combined antiretroviral treatment is required. However, an improved quality of life in this population is limited by adverse drug effects. The highest risk of treatment toxicity is developing a complete metabolic syndrome including: Hyperlipemia, lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, lactic acidosis, osteopenia, hypertension, and specific system and organ toxicity, such as the kidney, liver, CNS or bone marrow. The risk of cardiovascular disease adult life and also definitive bone mass damage are the most significant metabolic costs that have to paid for increased survival. Most of these toxicities were able to be adequately treated but, pharmacological interferences, patient intolerance and the high number of drugs are the problems that limit the adherence to treatment, which is essential for a good therapeutical efficacy. In this article, we present four HIV paediatric patients who presented with almost the whole range of metabolic toxicities, and a practical overview of therapeutical management."
9015,0.005,1.0000,"To determine the true incidence of abnormalities in bone marrow specimens from patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the clinical significance of these abnormalities regarding their cause and their role in the production of hematologic complications, 216 bone marrow biopsies, aspirates, and/or imprint preparations from 178 patients who either were seropositive for HIV infection or met the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were studied. Detailed morphologic review was performed in a blind fashion as to clinical status. Extensive clinical, therapeutic, and laboratory data were collected for each patient. Statistical analysis was performed to detect significant correlations between morphologic findings and clinical/therapeutic/laboratory features. Among the most common bone marrow findings were hypercellularity (53% of specimens), myelodysplasia (69%), evidence of reticuloendothelial (RE) iron blockade (65%), megaloblastic hematopoiesis (38%), fibrosis (20%), plasmacytosis (25%), lymphocytic aggregates (36%), and granulomas (13%). A number of statistically significant correlations between morphologic findings and clinical features were noted. No significant association was detected between any morphologic finding and therapy with a variety of drugs. In 7 of 14 (50%) patients found to have marrow involvement by malignant neoplasm, the bone marrow represented the initial site of diagnosis of the neoplasm. Most of the bone marrow abnormalities associated with HIV infection appear to be related directly to the infection or its complications and not to therapeutic intervention. In certain clinical situations, bone marrow examination continues to be useful in the management of patients infected with HIV."
7885,0.005,1.0000,"Given that low muscle mass can lead to worse health outcomes in patients with chronic infections, we assessed whether chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was associated with low muscle mass among US adults. We performed a cross-sectional study of the National Health Examination and Nutrition Study (1999-2010). Chronic HCV-infected patients had detectable HCV RNA. Low muscle mass was defined as <10th percentile for mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of low muscle mass associated with chronic HCV. Among 18 513 adults, chronic HCV-infected patients (n = 303) had a higher prevalence of low muscle mass than uninfected persons (13.8% vs 6.7%; aOR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.39-3.56), and this association remained when analyses were repeated among persons without significant liver fibrosis (aOR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.30-3.47). This study demonstrates that chronic HCV infection is associated with low muscle mass, as assessed by MUAC measurements, even in the absence of advanced liver disease. "
12453,0.005,1.0000,"The immune response against HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection partly depends on chemokine-mediated recruitment of specific T cells. CXCL12 polymorphisms have been associated with AIDS progression and survival, but there are no data related to HCV infection. The aim of this study was to determine whether CXCL12 polymorphisms are related so as to achieve sustained virological response (SVR) after HCV therapy with pegylated-interferon-alpha/ribavirin (pegIFN-α/ribavirin) in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. We carried out a retrospective study in 319 naive patients who started HCV treatment. The CXCL12 (rs266093, rs1029153, and rs1801157) and IL28B (rs12980275) polymorphisms were genotyped by using the GoldenGate assay. Genetic data were analyzed under an additive inheritance model. The overall rates of the SVR were 54.9% (175/319) and 41.5% (90/217) in GT1/4 patients and 83.2% (84/101) in GT2/3 patients. Patients with a favorable CXCL12 rs1029153 T allele had higher SVR rates than patients with the rs1029153 CC genotype (44% CC, 49% CT, and 61.3% TT; p = 0.025). No significant results for the rs266093 and rs1801157 polymorphisms were found. Patients harboring the favorable rs1029153 T allele had significantly increased odds of achieving SVR [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.55; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.01; 2.40; p = 0.047]. Moreover, no significant association was found when the study population was stratified by HCV genotype (data not shown), possibly due to the low number of patients in each group. In conclusion, in this study we found that the favorable CXCL12 rs1029153 T allele seems to be related so as to achieve an SVR in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients on pegIFN-α/ribavirin therapy."
9798,0.005,1.0000,"A WHO collaborative study on viral hepatitis B in which 21 laboratories in 20 countries participated is described. The aim of the study was to define the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), its subtypes, and its antibody (anti-HBs) by age and sex and urban or rural residence in normal populations in different parts of the world. High-risk groups in the populations and patients with various diseases were also investigated. The results of the study confirmed that HBsAg and anti-HBs prevalence rates were higher in African and Asian countries than in the Americas, Australia, and northern and central Europe. Some eastern and southern European countries, however, were also shown to have high HBsAg and anti-HBs prevalence rates, comparable with those in Africa and Asia. In countries with low HBsAg and anti-HBs prevalence, there seems to be a gradual build-up during late childhood or early adolescence, whereas in countries with high HBsAg and its antibody prevalence, they were frequently detected in preschool children. Although the trend was towards a higher frequency of HBsAg and anti-HBs in urban than in rural and in male than in female populations, the differences were in most cases not significant. On the other hand, a significantly higher prevalence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection was seen in high-risk population groups than in normal populations. This was, however, clearly defined only in areas with low HBsAg and anti-HBs prevalence in the normal population. The geographical distribution of HBsAg subtypes showed a higher prevalence of the ad subdeterminant over ay in central European countries, whereas in eastern and southern Europe the ay subtype predominated. In West Africa, ayw was the only variant found, whereas in East Africa ad occurred more frequently than ay. In Australia, both adw and ayw subtypes were detected, whereas in the Far East and South-east Asia only adw and adr were seen."

Liver stiffness at baseline and alanine aminotransferase levels at baseline and during follow-up were measured in order to find a correlation between drug levels and liver fibrosis or hepatotoxicity.
17574,0.005,1.0000,"A combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) is currently recommended as prophylaxis against the recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) after liver transplantation (LT), but the optimal protocol is a matter of controversy. The aim of this study was the identification of factors associated with post-LT HBV recurrence in patients receiving HBIG and NUCs. We searched MEDLINE and PubMed for studies in English about the effectiveness of HBIG and NUCs [lamivudine (LAM) and/or adefovir dipivoxil (ADV)] against post-LT HBV recurrence (January 1998 to June 2010). Forty-six studies, which included 2162 HBV LT recipients, met the selection criteria. Patients receiving HBIG and LAM experienced HBV recurrence more frequently than patients receiving HBIG and ADV with or without LAM [6.1% (115/1889) versus 2.0% (3/152), P = 0.024], although they also were more frequently treated with indefinite HBIG prophylaxis (90% versus 57%, P < 0.001). For patients receiving HBIG and LAM, a lower frequency of HBV recurrence was associated with a high HBIG dosage (≥10,000 IU/day) versus a low HBIG dosage (<10,000 IU/day) during the first week after LT [3.2% (14/440) versus 6.5% (80/1233), P = 0.016], but the HBIG protocol had no impact on HBV recurrence in patients receiving HBIG and ADV. In conclusion, in comparison with the combination of HBIG and LAM, the combination of HBIG and ADV is associated with a lower rate of HBV recurrence after LT. Patients receiving HBIG and LAM should be given a high dosage of HBIG during the first week after LT, but a lower dosage can be used safely in patients receiving HBIG and ADV. Further studies with newer and more potent anti-HBV agents are definitely required."

In all the patients at least one out of five determined HBV markers (HBsAg. HBeAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc and anti-HBe) was detected. HBsAg was found in 10% of the patients, and its prevalence in haemophiliacs B was higher than than observed in haemophiliacs A (22.7% and 6.4%, respectively). HBsAg appeared more frequently in patients receiving factor VIII concentrates (16.7%) than in those treated with cryoprecipitate (4.5%). Anti-CMV antibody was detected in sera of 98% of the patients. In 1/3 samples of cryoprecipitate anti-HBc or anti-HBs were present, and in the half of samples anti-CMV occurred. Abnormal liver function tests indicating chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis were obtained in 8 patients. Raised ALT activity which could suggest chronic infection with non-A, non-B virus occurred in 6 cases. The present study indicates that haemophiliacs frequently transfused with plasma products are at high risk for viral infections leading to liver dysfunction."
4046,0.005,1.0000,"The association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) has been demonstrated by epidemiological studies, in particular in highly endemic geographical areas such as Italy, Japan, and southern parts of United States. In these countries, together with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, marginal zone lymphomas are the histotypes most frequently associated with HCV infection; in Italy around 20-30% cases of marginal zone lymphomas are HCV positive. Recently, antiviral treatment with interferon with or without ribavirin has been proved to be effective in the treatment of HCV-positive patients affected by indolent lymphoma, prevalently of marginal zone origin. An increasing number of experiences confirmed the validity of this approach in marginal zone lymphomas and in other indolent NHL subtypes like lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Across different studies, overall response rate was approximately 75%. Hematological responses resulted significantly associated with the eradication of the virus. This is the strongest evidence of a causative link between HCV and lymphomas. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the relationship between HCV infection and different subtypes of indolent B-cell lymphomas and to systematically summarize the data from the therapeutic studies that reported the use of antiviral treatment as hematological therapy in patients with HCV-associated indolent lymphomas."
12135,0.005,1.0000,"Transaminase elevation is frequently seen in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-HIV-coinfected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), representing an increase in the immune response against HCV and being one of the mechanisms proposed to be involved. There is a report claiming that HCV genotype 3 is an independent risk factor. Our objectives were to assess the incidence of liver toxicity in an HIV-HCV-coinfected population with relatively preserved cellular immunity, and the role of HCV genotypes in the elevation of liver enzymes, both at baseline and after initiating ART. All HIV(+) patients with positive anti-HCV serology and CD4(+) cell counts above 100/mm(3) who began triple ART were identified, and their HCV-RNA levels and HCV genotype were determined. Liver enzymes were determined at baseline and bimonthly during follow-up. Of anti-HCV patients 147 were included, 128 (87.1%) of whom had detectable plasma HCV-RNA. HCV-1 and HCV-4 genotypes were found to confer an increased probability of having at baseline transaminases within normal limits over the other genotypes. Severe transaminase elevations (grades 3 and 4) occurred in 5/124 patients (4.0%), all with high pre-HAART ALT and positive HCV-RNA levels. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with genotype HCV-3 had a 3.27 times higher risk of developing HAART-related transaminase elevations of any grade. In conclusion, subjects with the HCV-1 genotype more often had transaminases within normal limits at baseline. The incidence of severe transaminase elevation after initiating ART was very low (4%) in this HIV(+) population with relatively preserved cellular immunity. HCV genotype 3 was identified as a risk factor for the development of transaminase elevation of any grade."
16129,0.005,1.0000,"Tenofovir (TFV) is eliminated by renal excretion, which is mediated through multidrug-resistant protein 2 (MRP2) and MRP4, encoded by ABCC2 and ABCC4, respectively. Genetic polymorphisms of these transporters may affect the plasma concentrations of tenofovir. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of genetic and nongenetic factors on tenofovir plasma concentrations. A cross-sectional study was performed in Thai HIV-infected patients aged ≥18 years who had been receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate at 300 mg once daily for at least 6 months. A middose tenofovir plasma concentration was obtained. Multivariate analysis was performed to investigate whether there was an association between tenofovir plasma concentrations and demographic data, including age, sex, body weight, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hepatitis B virus coinfection, hepatitis C virus coinfection, duration of tenofovir treatment, concomitant use of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, and polymorphisms of ABCC2 and ABCC4. A total of 150 Thai HIV-infected patients were included. The mean age of the patients was 43.9 ± 7.2 years. The mean tenofovir plasma concentration was 100.3 ± 52.7 ng/ml. In multivariate analysis, a low body weight, a low eGFR, the concomitant use of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, and the ABCC4 4131T → G variation (genotype TG or GG) were independently associated with higher tenofovir plasma concentrations. After adjusting for weight, eGFR, and the concomitant use of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, a 30% increase in the mean tenofovir plasma concentration was observed in patients having the ABCC4 4131 TG or GG genotype. Both genetic and nongenetic factors affect tenofovir plasma concentrations. These factors should be considered when adjusting tenofovir dosage regimens to ensure the efficacy and safety of a drug.

2197,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver fibrosis progression is accelerated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The effect of protease inhibitor (PI) therapy on liver fibrosis is unknown. The aim of this work was to analyze the impact of PI therapy on HCV-related liver fibrosis in HIV/HCV coinfected patients. We evaluated in a long-term follow-up retrospective cohort study the influence of antiretroviral therapy containing PI on liver fibrosis in 182 consecutive HIV/HCV coinfected patients. At liver biopsy, 63 patients had received PI and 119 patients had never been treated with PI. Relationships between liver histologic features, age, alcohol consumption, CD4 cell count, HIV-RNA load, and antiretroviral regimens were analyzed. Liver fibrosis stage was lower in patients receiving PIs by comparison with patients who had never received PIs (P =.03). The 5-, 15-, and 25-year cirrhosis rates were 2% versus 5%, 5% versus 18%, and 9% versus 27%, respectively, in patients who had received PIs compared with PI-untreated patients (P =.0006). Multivariate analysis identified 4 independent predictors of progression to cirrhosis: absence of protease inhibitor therapy (relative risk [RR] = 4.74, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34-16.67), heavy alcohol consumption (> or = 50 g daily) (RR = 4.71, 95% CI, 1.92-11.57), low CD4 cell count (<200/microL) (RR = 2.74, 95% CI, 1.17-6.41), and age at HCV contamination (> or = 20 years) (RR = 2.37, 95% CI, 1.04-5.38). In conclusion, protease inhibitor therapy might not accelerate progression to HCV-related cirrhosis. Furthermore, chronic use of antiretroviral therapy containing PI together with reduction of alcohol consumption and maintenance of high CD4 count could have a beneficial impact on liver fibrosis progression in HIV/HCV coinfected patients."
15625,0.005,1.0000,"Anemia is a multifactorial problem in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, cancer, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. New insights regarding anemia symptoms and quality of life (QOL) have prompted reassessment of traditional triggers for anemia treatment to increase hemoglobin (Hb) and improve QOL. In HIV-positive patients, anemia is independently associated with disease progression and survival. Many HIV-positive patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) still develop mild to moderate anemia and associated QOL impairment. Epoetin alfa effectively increases Hb and improves QOL in these patients. Many HIV-positive patients are coinfected with HCV. Standard HCV therapy (interferon alfa/ribavirin) can cause anemia that may result in treatment alterations and compromised virologic outcome. Epoetin alfa therapy in anemic HCV patients increases Hb levels and may provide other benefits. Neuroprotective effects of epoetin alfa in preclinical models of central nervous system disorders have recently been demonstrated, implying a new therapeutic role for this cytokine."

A Heckman 2-stage approach (generalized estimating equations probit model) was used to compare visits with moderate or poor adherence and visits with high adherence. Between months 12 and 60, at least 1 self-reported adherence measure was available for 970 of the 1110 patients with at least 12 months of follow-up (3889 visits with adherence assessments). Adherence was rated as high at 2466 visits, moderate at 1125, and poor at 298. After adjustment for ""missingness,"" moderate and poor adherence were independently associated with age (younger), perceived treatment side effects, dosing frequency different from twice daily, and a protease inhibitor-based regimen. They were also associated with depression and lack of support from the main partner. High adherence was most likely among patients born outside the European Union. A comparison restricted to poor-adherence and high-adherence visits yielded a similar pattern of predictors. Adjusting for missing outcome data changed the predictor set. Reasons for nonadherence are multifactorial. Psychosocial interventions and the selection of the best-tolerated regimens are needed to improve long-term adherence of HIV-infected patients to their lifelong treatment."

Precise data about the extent to which patients appeal to hospital health care facilities and resulting costs are not available, mainly due to the absence of suitable methods for the registration of demographic, medical and financial data on individual patients in hospitals. In this paper we present the preliminary results of application of a new system which allows such a detailed collection and analysis of data. By evaluating patients with HIV infections treated in the University Hospital Utrecht between January 1, 1987 and July 1, 1988, the mean yearly costs of in- and outpatient treatment of a patient with AIDS (CDC-IV) were found to be Dfl. 40,267.-; those of treatment of patients with other HIV infections ranged from Dfl. 3,629.-(CDC-III) to Dfl. 5,115.-(CDC-II). Comparison of the mean costs for patients who died in that period with those for patients who did not, reveals that patients dead of AIDS would have cost Dfl. 75,289.-yearly and those with AIDS who were alive at July 1, 1988 Dfl. 27,308.-."
1189,0.005,1.0000,"A total of 181 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive hemophiliacs and 28 hemophilic controls were evaluated by psychometric tests and by electroencephalogram (EEG). Patients were classified from stages 1-6 according to the immunological criteria of the Walter Reed staging system. Statistical analysis of psychometric data showed an effect of the stage of the disease on test performances, indicating a decline in attention, accumulation of perceptual interferences, decline in visuoperceptual speed and visuomotor response speed and reduced verbal memory performance, especially in stage 6 patients. Comparison of performance levels with normative test data already revealed cognitive deficits in about 20-30% of the patients in stages 2-5. As regards verbal memory, especially learning and recognition of new verbal information were impaired. In contrast, there was no significant deficit for nonverbal memory processing. Compared with the controls, patients exhibited an increasing number of abnormal EEG findings in stages 2-6. As a conclusion, in the stages before acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) develops, EEG findings as well as psychometric findings indicate central nervous system involvement of AIDS in about 20-30% of cases, whereas in full-blown AIDS there is a marked increase to 80%. Besides a more general deficit of attention and psychomotor speed as is seen in subcortical dementia, there is evidence for a particular verbal learning disorder, suggesting additional selective impairment of the brain."

Meta-analyses of IRIS from various reports published worldwide by Monika Muller et al described 12% IRIS incidence and 15.7% IRIS tuberculosis. Among IRIS tuberculosis, central nervous system involvement with IRIS tuberculous meningitis forms only 7%. Only 9 cases of tuberculous brain abscess is reported in patients with AIDS so far. The IRIS tuberculous brain abscess is very rare, and so far only 1 case is reported as a paradoxical reaction after ART initiation.

19751,0.005,1.0000,"Within-patient HIV populations evolve rapidly because of a high mutation rate, short generation time, and strong positive selection pressures. Previous studies have identified ""consistent patterns"" of viral sequence evolution. Just before HIV infection progresses to AIDS, evolution seems to slow markedly, and the genetic diversity of the viral population drops. This evolutionary slowdown could be caused either by a reduction in the average viral replication rate or because selection pressures weaken with the collapse of the immune system. The former hypothesis (which we denote ""cellular exhaustion"") predicts a simultaneous reduction in both synonymous and nonsynonymous evolution, whereas the latter hypothesis (denoted ""immune relaxation"") predicts that only nonsynonymous evolution will slow. In this paper, we present a set of statistical procedures for distinguishing between these alternative hypotheses using DNA sequences sampled over the course of infection. The first component is a new method for estimating evolutionary rates that takes advantage of the temporal information in longitudinal DNA sequence samples. Second, we develop a set of probability models for the analysis of evolutionary rates in HIV populations in vivo. Application of these models to both synonymous and nonsynonymous evolution affords a comparison of the cellular-exhaustion and immune-relaxation hypotheses. We apply the procedures to longitudinal data sets in which sequences of the env gene were sampled over the entire course of infection. Our analyses (1) statistically confirm that an evolutionary slowdown occurs late in infection, (2) strongly support the immune-relaxation hypothesis, and (3) indicate that the cessation of nonsynonymous evolution is associated with disease progression."
17128,0.005,1.0000,"We performed a case-control study to evaluate the association of a new human DNA virus named TT virus (TTV) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We recruited 174 subjects hospitalized for HCC (84% males; mean age: 64 years) and 118 patients hospitalized for non-liver diseases in Brescia, northern Italy, as controls (94% males; mean age: 66 years). TTV DNA was found in serum by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 26 cases (15%) and 11 controls (9.3%) (P >. 1). TTV group 2 infection was identified in 16 cases (61.5%) and 4 controls (36.4%) (P >.1) using a type-specific PCR method. Sequence analysis of 222 nt of TTV DNA demonstrated that the remaining 10 cases and 7 controls were all infected by group 1. The odds ratio (OR) for TTV-DNA positivity, adjusted for demographic variables, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, and heavy alcohol intake was 1.8 (95% CI: 0.7-4.8; P >.1). The OR did not change when the analysis was restricted to 14 HCC cases and 56 controls who were negative for each known risk factor for HCC (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 0.8-4.0). TTV-DNA positivity was not associated with transfusion history. The prevalence of TTV DNA was higher among HCC cases positive for HBsAg (10 of 38 [26.3%]) than among those positive for HCV RNA (8 of 62 [12.9%]) or negative for hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV, and hepatitis G virus (HGV) infections (5 of 62 [8. 1%]) (P =.02).

Ten individuals were nonresponder (NR) or relapser (RE) to P-R treatment and 9 had a sustained virological response (SVR).Eleven/nineteen (58%) patients had MG in plasma compartment. Ten or 12 patients infected by a difficult to treat genotype (DTG) 1 or 4 as dominant strain, had an MG, whereas only 1/7 individuals infected by easy to treat genotype (ETG) harbored a mixed genotype, P = 0.006. HCV-RNA was more frequently detected in PBMC of NR (10/10) than in those of SVR (5/9), P = 0.032. Mixed genotype infection was detected in 6/15 (40%) PBMC-positive cases and was not associated with P-R treatment response. By multivariate analysis, MG in plasma samples was the most important viral factor affecting the treatment response (P = 0.0237).Detection of MG in plasma of HIV/HCV coinfected patients seems to represent the major determinant of response to P-R treatment. This finding may have important clinical implication in light of the new therapeutic approach in HIV/HCV coinfected individuals suggesting that combination treatment with direct acting antivirals could be less effective in MG."

ART maladherence likely plays a role in the increase of AIDS-related deaths among adolescents and has shown to be associated with psychosocial and mental health difficulties. Addressing the specific mental health needs of HIV-positive adolescents is critical to ending the HIV epidemic. This cross-sectional study prospectively enrolled HIV-positive adolescents (12-24 years) in Moshi, Tanzania. A structured questionnaire was administered that included questions about home, school, adherence, and measures of stigma (Berger Stigma Scale) and mental health. Mental health measures included depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), emotional/behavioral difficulties (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), and traumatic experiences/post-traumatic stress symptoms (The University of California Los Angeles-post-traumatic stress disorder-Reaction Index). Mental health difficulties were prevalent among HIV-positive adolescents and were associated with incomplete adherence and stigma. Resources are needed to reduce HIV stigma and address mental health among HIV-positive adolescents in low-resource settings. This will improve not only mental health, but may also improve ART adherence and virologic suppression, improving overall health of the individual and reducing the risk of HIV transmission to others."

On six SPS subscales, mean scores (possible scores = 0-8), were: Reliable Alliance (others can be counted on for tangible assistance) = 2.8, Attachment (emotional closeness providing sense of security) = 2.9, Reassurance of Worth (recognition of competence and value by others) = 3.2, Guidance (provision of advice or information by others) = 3.2, Social Integration (belonging to a group with similar interests and concerns) = 3.5, and Nurturance (belief that others rely on one for their well-being) = 3.6. In multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with lower social support scores were: lower education level (did not complete primary school) (p = .019), lower total score on knowledge items about HIV care/treatment (p = .038), and greater number of external stigma experiences in past three months (p < .001); greater number of chronic disease symptoms was of borderline significance (p = .098). Among rural Ethiopian patients newly entering HIV care, we found moderate and varying levels of perceived social support, with lowest scores for subscales reflecting emotional closeness and reliance on others for tangible assistance. Given that patients who have recently learned their diagnosis and entered care may be an especially vulnerable group, programs to help identify and address social support needs can provide multiple benefits in facilitating the best possible physical, emotional and functional quality of life for people living with HIV.

10320,0.005,1.0000,"We have studied the evolution of the avidity of anti-HIV antibodies, in 14 infected patients with Aids, including 11 patients with severe immunodeficiency at Aids stage and under active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and 3 non-treated patients with moderate immunodeficiency. These patients have been followed up to 4 years, every 4 months the first year and every 6 months the three others, with HIV1 RNA viral load, CD4 and CD8 cells dosages and anti-HIV avidity measurements (Axsym HIV-1/2), using 1 M guanidine denaturation. A rapid decrease of the viral load was observed under Haart, inducing immune restoration with CD4 and CD8 cells increases (10 and 2-fold respectively). The decrease of anti-HIV avidity (- 20%) has been observed after 5 to 8 months under Haart, with a return to baseline value (84%). The quick restoration of CD4 cells with a persistence of viral antigens at the beginning of treatment has facilitated the selection of novel naive B lymphocytes producing low-affinity antibodies, measured by the decrease of global anti-HIV avidity. The reduction or even clearance of viral antigens under Haart could secondarily induce the selection of B lymphocytes with higher antibody affinity and therefore higher anti-HIV avidity. Thus, this avidity measurement could be used to assess the functional activity of CD4 cells restoration in HIV infected patients under Haart."
1164,0.005,1.0000,"The eye is a common site for complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Although cytomegalovirus retinitis remains the most prevalent of the blinding ocular disorders that can occur in individuals with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), several important HIV-associated disorders may involve the anterior segment, ocular surface, and adnexae. Some of these entities, such as Kaposi sarcoma, were well described, but uncommon, before the HIV epidemic. Others, like microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis, have presentations that differ between affected individuals with HIV disease and those from the general population who are immunocompetent. The treatment of many of these diseases is challenging because of host immunodeficiency. Survival after the diagnosis of AIDS has increased among individuals with HIV disease because of more effective antiretroviral therapies and improved prophylaxis against, and treatment of, opportunistic infections. This longer survival may lead to an increased prevalence of anterior segment and external ocular disorders. In addition, the evaluation and management of disorders such as blepharitis and dry eye, which were previously overshadowed by more severe, blinding disorders, may demand increased attention, as the general health of this population improves. Not all individuals infected with HIV receive potent antiretroviral therapy, however, because of socioeconomic or other factors, and others will be intolerant of these drugs or experience drug failure. Ophthalmologists must, therefore, still be aware of the ocular findings that develop in the setting of severe immunosuppression. This article reviews the spectrum of HIV-associated anterior segment and external ocular disorders, with recommendations for their evaluation and management."
10376,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is estimated to have infected more than a million people in the United States and millions more in other countries. Even though there is no vaccine or effective treatment, HIV infection can be prevented through behavioral change. As the lead Public Health Service Agency for disease prevention, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has designed and implemented information and education activities with the ultimate goal of preventing HIV infection and AIDS in the United States. The target populations include the general public, school- and college-aged populations, persons infected or at increased risk of infection, minorities, and health workers. Because AIDS will be with us for a long time, CDC views educating the public as a long-term undertaking. The agency has initiated an intensive continuing national public information campaign, an informational brochure to be distributed to every U.S. household, a national AIDS information toll-free hotline, and a clearinghouse system that will maintain a comprehensive inventory of AIDS information resources and services. CDC also supports public information and education efforts by State and local health agencies. To reach school- and college-age youth, CDC, in consultation with governmental and national private sector organizations, developed guidelines for effective school health education to assist school health personnel in determining the scope and content of AIDS education. CDC also works with State and local education agencies to help carry out and evaluate educational efforts to prevent the spread of HIV among school- and college-age youth. The populations with the highest priority for AIDS information and education efforts are those who are at increased risk of acquiring or transmitting the AIDS virus because they use illicit intravenous drugs and share needles, engage in anal intercourse, have many sexual partners, practice prostitution, or engage in sex with those who practice these behaviors. Another high-priority population, because they can infect their offspring,is reproductive age women engaging in high-risk behavior and women infected with HIV who become pregnant. CDC programs targeted to these groups include community health education and risk reduction interventions, counseling and testing for HIV infection, AIDS community demonstration projects, perinatal AIDS prevention projects,and programs focused on preventing AIDS in minority populations. CDC is developing a variety of educational approaches for health workers in clinical settings because they are an important channel for providing accurate AIDS information, helping to assess risk, and counseling to actively reduce risk for the patient, sex partners of the patient, friends, and family members of the patient. CDC has conducted research and provided information and training on the use of HIV laboratory tests. CDC has also developed numerous scientific and technical guidelines and recommendations in consultation with practitioners, public health officials, and others and disseminated these through the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. In addition,CDC has provided information about the risk of HIV transmission in the workplace and about methods of prevention. CDC will continue to evaluate these activities and support research in education and related interventions that may be necessary to prevent infection by the HIV virus. By providing educational support for behavior changes that decrease HIV transmission, we can contribute to AIDS prevention in the 1990s."
3669,0.005,1.0000,"We have previously showed that long-term intake of Korean red ginseng (KRG) delayed disease progression in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients. In the present study, to investigate whether this slow progression was affected by KRG intake alone or in combination with HLA factor, we analyzed clinical data in 68 HIV-1-infected patients who lived for more than 5 years without antiretroviral therapy. The average KRG intake over 111.9 +/- 31.3 months was 4,082 +/- 3,928 g, and annual decrease in CD4 T cells was 35.0 +/- 28.7/microl. Data analysis showed that there are significant inverse correlations between the HLA prognostic score (0.29 +/- 1.19) and annual decrease in CD4 T cells (r = -0.347; P < 0.01) as well as between the amount of KRG intake and annual decrease in CD4 T cells (r = -0.379; P < 0.01). In addition, KRG intake significantly slowed the decrease in CD4 T cells even when influence of HLA class I was statistically eliminated (repeated-measure analysis of variance; P < 0.05). We also observed significant correlation between KRG intake and a decrease in serum-soluble CD8 antigen level (r = 0.62; P < 0.001). In conclusion, these data show that KRG intake independently and significantly affected the slow depletion of CD4 T cells irrespective of HLA class I."
6719,0.005,1.0000,"There is little research on injecting drug use in Nigeria. We investigated the prevalence of HIV, hepatitis B and C, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among male injection drug users (IDUs) in Lagos. Male IDUs (N = 328) were recruited through respondent-driven sampling. Participants completed an interview about their sexual and injecting risk behaviours and were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBV), hepatitis C antibody (HCV), HIV and syphilis, as well as genital chlamydia and gonorrhoea infections. Three-quarters of IDUs (74%) reported injecting drugs in the past one month although most did not share needles (92%) and the majority obtained sterile needles from pharmacists (87%). Estimated HBV, HCV, HIV, syphilis, gonorrhoea and chlamydia prevalences were 7.8%, 7.7%, 0.9%, 1.9%, 0.0%, and 3.7%, respectively. The burden of HIV is presently low among IDUs in Lagos. Changes in accessibility to sterile needles at pharmacists would likely have a deleterious effect on IDUs' health. HBV vaccination and HCV prevention programmes for IDUs are urgently needed."
6500,0.005,1.0000,"Up to 31 March 1988, 1429 cases meeting the World Health Organization/Centers for Disease Control (U.S.A.) definition of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were reported in the U.K. of which 59 were in visitors and 1370 in U.K. residents. In the same period there were 8459 laboratory reports of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody-positive tests. Since 1985 the median interval of 2 months between diagnosis and report of AIDS has not changed. Most patients with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) as an indicator disease when AIDS was diagnosed were homosexual/bisexual males; the proportion in this category has declined. The data support the hypothesis for a co-factor in the aetiology of KS in homosexual/bisexual males and that the effect of this co-factor has progressively weakened. Injecting drugs was a risk factor for 48 patients with AIDS (4%), half of whom were also homosexual/bisexual males, and for 1406 (17%) persons reported as HIV antibody-positive of whom 63 were also homosexual/bisexual males. HIV-infected persons injecting drugs were reported from all parts of the U.K., apart from Northern Ireland, but the cumulative rate per million population in Scotland for such persons was more than six times the rate elsewhere. In the collaborative laboratory study in England, 2.3% of over 3000 persons injecting drugs were HIV antibody-positive; among those who were asymptomatic the prevalence in London was 7.1% compared with 1.3% outside London. By 1987, the incidence rate of acute hepatitis B in persons injecting drugs in England had fallen to less than a third of that for 1985; in Scotland the figure for 1987 was only a quarter of that for 1985. Since the current rate of HIV transmission among persons in the U.K. injecting drugs is unknown, monitoring the prevalence of HIV in this risk group should be intensified."
7108,0.005,1.0000,"To assess a hypothesized trend that persons recently infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may have more rapid declines in absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte (CD4+ cell) counts than those who were HIV-infected in earlier years, sequential CD4+ cell counts in three groups who had definable dates of HIV seroconversion between 1978 and 1992 were reviewed. The CD4+ cell counts examined were from some of the longest extant studies in the United States: 100 homosexual and bisexual men engaged in ongoing observational cohort studies in San Francisco, Denver, and Chicago since 1978 (Group 1); 89 persons in South Carolina infected after 1986 (Group 2); and 155 injecting drug users participating in an observational cohort study in Baltimore since 1988 (Group 3). For all groups, individually and in the aggregate, mean CD4+ cell counts declined rapidly in the first year after HIV infection and then stabilized. However, there was no clear trend for lower (or higher) CD4+ cell counts by fixed time after HIV seroconversion among those seroconverting in recent compared with earlier calendar years. These data do not support a hypothesized trend for more rapid loss of CD4 T lymphocytes--and, by implication, more pathogenic strains of HIV-1--among persons acquiring HIV infection in recent years."
3620,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sentinel surveillance program for injecting drug users has been conducted in Metro Cebu, the Philippines. A low prevalence (0-0.52%) of anti-HIV-positivity had been detected in this population from 2002 to 2007. However, a 10-fold increase in HIV prevalence was detected in the 2009 national HIV sentinel surveillance program. It prompted an additional outreach program to be conducted in Metro Cebu in January 2010, which recorded the highest HIV prevalence rate ever documented in the Philippines (75%, 44/59). HIV genes from fourteen 2009 to 2010 Metro Cebu strains were clustered closely in the phylogenetic tree, but no other strain collected outside Metro Cebu and none stored in the International Nucleotide Sequence Database was allocated to the same phylogenetic cluster. All these HIV infections have emerged in the anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive population (100%, 62/62) in Metro Cebu from 2009 to 2010. The five HCV strains from the individuals harboring the closely related HIV strains were categorized into different subtypes. These results strongly suggest that HIV infections occurred recently and spread rapidly among injecting drug users, while HCV had been circulating previously among them. Considering the fact that injecting drug use was the first mode of HIV transmission in Asia, extensive monitoring of injecting drug users and associated bridging populations is necessary. Therefore, HCV-guided characterization of the spread of HIV to populations that are vulnerable to blood-borne infections could play an important role in alerting health authorities to the early phase of an HIV epidemic."
16505,0.005,1.0000,"Comparisons of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression between risk groups are difficult primarily because of the long incubation period of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and unknown times of infection. This is believed to be the first study that directly compared changes in T-lymphocyte subsets following HIV-1 seroconversion between cohorts of predominantly black injecting drug users and predominantly white homosexual men. Longitudinal trends of CD4 and CD8 percentages of total lymphocytes during 4 years were modeled as piecewise linear functions with a two-parameter correlation structure to accommodate within-person repeated observations. Prior to seroconversion the 151 injecting drug users started with similar CD4% and CD8% levels compared with the 99 homosexual men. Following seroconversion, larger changes were observed overall in the homosexual men compared with the injecting drug users for both markers (p < or = 0.001). The major discrepancies, however, were limited to the first 2 years. Subsequently, the CD4% levels of the two cohorts converged and then declined at similar rates. These comparative analyses of HIV seroconverters in homosexual men and injecting drug users suggest that risk group has only a minor effect on the initial course of HIV infection."
2080,0.005,1.0000,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been associated with primary central nervous system lymphoma and other EBV-related malignancies in HIV infected patients, and detection of EBV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been demonstrated to be a good marker of PCNSL. Conversely, EBV has been rarely associated with encephalitis in HIV patients. Here we describe for the first time the case of an HIV-infected, late presenter Caucasian man, diagnosed with a rapidly progressive diffuse encephalitis at presentation. A very high viral load for EBV was detected in CSF by PCR. The patient died 12 days after the onset of encephalitis in spite of supportive, antiviral and antiretroviral therapy. Our experience would suggest that in profoundly immunosuppressed HIV patients EBV may cause severe encephalitis in the absence of lymphoproliferative disorders."
6510,0.005,1.0000,"Plasma HIV-1 RNA testing was used to monitor 43 HIV-1 infected patients newly placed on antiretroviral therapy or whose therapy had been recently changed. A polymerase chain reaction kit was used to measure HIV-1 RNA in clinical samples or frozen plasma. The cutoff of this test was 200 RNA copies/ml. The first group (11 patients) was stable on long-term zidovudine monotherapy when switched to stavudine. The HIV-1 RNA of three patients who had a regular decline in CD4+ T cell count did not change despite this switch, with a mean follow-up of 630 days. The HIV-1 RNA copy numbers of eight patients whose CD4+ T cell counts were stable declined an average of 0.53 log10 between days 90 and 650. The second group (14 patients) was on long-term zidovudine monotherapy and had declining CD4+ T cell counts over the past 6 months. Lamivudine was added to this regimen on day 0. HIV-1 RNA copy number decreased rapidly within 30 d, reaching -0.86 log10 on day 90, and this effect was maintained thereafter, with a mean follow-up of 161 days. There was a concomitant mean gain of +33 CD4+ T cells on day 90. The third group (nine patients) had never received anti-retroviral therapy and was given zidovudine+didanosine. HIV-1 RNA copy number decreased in all cases but one, reaching -1.31 log10 on day 150. This decrease was transient in three cases. The last group (nine patients) had also not had previous anti-retroviral therapy and was given zidovudine + didanosine + lamivudine in combination. HIV-1 RNA copy numbers declined rapidly in all cases, to below the cutoff in eight cases within a mean period of 50.5 days. The CD4+ cell counts increased by 164 cells/microliter on day 14 and by 201 cells/microliter on day 180. The response to therapy of the total population of 43 patients varied according to cases. The relative changes in p24 antigen compared to HIV-1 RNA also differed between patients. Measurement of HIV-1 viremia appears to be a valuable tool in current practice for individualizing therapy."
179,0.005,1.0000,"Co-infection with GB virus C (GBV-C) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) appears to reduce mortality for HIV/AIDS. Epidemiological and demographic factors for GBV-C were examined prospectively in 167 subjects at risk for co-infection. We attempted to establish a hierarchical exposure risk for GBV-C. Overall exposure to GBV-C was 45.5%. In univariate analysis, GBV-C was associated with male to male sex (P<0.0001), HIV infection (P=0.0005) and hepatitis B infection (P=0.006). Injecting drug use approached statistical significance (P=0.08) while being a female sex worker was not associated with GBV-C exposure/infection (P=0.85). Exposure to GBV-C in 192 healthy blood donors was found to be 9.4%. In conclusion, the data suggest that male to male sex is a more effective mode of transmission of GBV-C and that GBV-C is associated with HIV co-infection. As male to male sex is also a risk factor for HIV transmission our data suggest that many may benefit from the potential protective effect GBV-C exerts on HIV-infected persons."
8180,0.005,1.0000,"Interferon alpha (IFNα) therapy, despite good efficacy in curing HCV infection, leads to major side effects, in particular inducement of a strong peripheral T-cell lymphocytopenia. We here analyze the early consequences of IFNα therapy on both thymic function and peripheral T-cell homeostasis in patients in the acute or chronic phase of HCV-infection as well as in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. The evolution of T-cell subsets and T-cell homeostasis were estimated by flow cytometry while thymic function was measured through quantification of T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) and estimation of intrathymic precursor T-cell proliferation during the first four months following the initiation of IFNα therapy. Beginning with the first month of therapy, a profound lymphocytopenia was observed for all T-cell subsets, including naïve T-cells and recent thymic emigrants (RTE), associated with inhibition of intrathymic precursor T-cell proliferation. Interleukin (IL)-7 plasma concentration rapidly dropped while lymphocytopenia progressed. This was neither a consequence of higher consumption of the cytokine nor due to its neutralization by soluble CD127. Decrease in IL-7 plasma concentration under IFNα therapy correlated with the decline in HCV viral load, thymic activity and RTE concentration in blood. These data demonstrate that IFNα-based therapy rapidly impacts on thymopoiesis and, consequently, perturbs T-cell homeostasis. Such a side effect might be detrimental for the continuation of IFNα therapy and may lead to an increased level of infectious risk, in particular in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Altogether, this study suggests the therapeutic potential of IL-7 in the maintenance of peripheral T-cell homeostasis in IFNα-treated patients."
6210,0.005,1.0000,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a form of skin cancer, most commonly found in individuals suffering from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. However, before the worldwide infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the rare occurrence of KS was confined to two distinct groups of individuals. In the Western world, the classical form of KS was often found in older men (60-70 years of age) from the Mediterranean area. Another form called endemic KS, was found in Equatorial Africa. Currently, the most common cases of KS are found in individuals suffering from AIDS. This is called AIDS-associated KS. Between 30 and 40% of male, homosexual AIDS patients suffer from AIDS-associated KS. KS is also occasionally diagnosed in transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs (to keep their body from rejecting the foreign organ). As opposed to cases of classic and endemic KS, the KS in AIDS patients progresses very quickly, often with a fatal outcome. Human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) has been implicated as the cause of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), but the exact connection of the virus to the neoplasm is not known. The virus has been detected within the sarcoma skin lesions, but has additionally been seen in peripheral blood cells, semen samples, prostate tissue, and other types of soft tissue tumors. In this study, we evaluated HHV-8 within the skin lesion of KS as well as in semen specimens obtained from HIV-1 infected and uninfected specimens from HIV-1-seronegative individuals. Twenty-eight tissue samples representing AIDS-associated, endemic KS, and six non-KS patients were collected for observation from different centers throughout the world. The tissues were examined utilizing in situ polymerase chain reaction (ISPCR) and hybridization to identify and localize the herpesvirus within the KS lesions. With the use of the sensitive ISPCR technique, HHV-8 DNA was detected in the spindle cells within the nodular skin lesions, as well as in the microvascular endothelial cells which line small vessels within the lesions in all forms of KS. In addition, we analysed semen specimens from HIV-1 infected and uninfected men, our analyses revealed that HHV-8 was present in the significant proportions of the HIV-1-infected-individuals' sperm, as well as in the mononuclear cells of the semen specimens. HHV-8 DNA was demonstrated, by ISPCR, in KS lesions as well as in seminal mononuclear cells and sperm of significantly high proportion of HIV-1-infected men. What role the presence of HHV-8 in the sperm cells plays in the sexual transmission of this herpesvirus will require further study. However, the reports which demonstrate that KS lesions can develop in infants of only a few weeks of age, increases the possibility that this agent may be vertically transmitted. It can be suggested that HHV-8 is relatively ubiquitous and its frequency increases with the increasing immunosuppression."
5836,0.005,1.0000,"Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) develop a spectrum of B cell lymphoproliferative disorders ranging from polyclonal B cell activation to B cell lymphomas. While a direct role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is well recognized for most of these lesions, recent findings have suggested that transactivator HIV-1 Tat protein might be involved in the pathogenesis of B cell lymphomas. Tat-expressing EBV-positive B cells were generated by transduction with a retroviral Tat-encoding vector. B(Tat+) cells expressed lower levels of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 than parental and control B(Tat-) cells, generated by transduction with an empty retroviral vector, and were more prone to apoptosis upon serum withdrawal, as assessed by analysis of annexin V-stained cells and cleavage of poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase by caspase 3. Nevertheless, in serum starvation, B(Tat-) cells mainly exhibited the Rb hypo-phosphorylated form, underwent cell cycle arrest, and grew in single cell suspension, while B(Tat+) cells displayed the Rb hyper-phoshorylated form, progressed throughout the cell cycle, and retained the ability to grow in small clumps. Finding that B(Tat+) cells maintained proliferative capacity upon serum withdrawal suggests that cells expressing Tat have growth advantages among the EBV-driven cell proliferations and may originate B cell clones with more oncogenic potential."
4823,0.005,1.0000,"The HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promotes and modulates proviral transcription in the infected cell. It has been suggested that truncations and even point mutations in functional sites of the LTR are associated with low viral replication and attenuated pathogenesis in HIV-1-infected long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs). We performed a detailed analysis of LTR sequences from proviral DNA of 21 Italian and Swedish, well-characterized LTNPs and of 15 progressor patients. No truncation was found and no correlation was identified between specific LTR mutations and disease progression. We also failed to find a significant correlation between phylogenetic distance and clinical status. Although HIV-1 LTR interpatient heterogeneity among LTNPs and subjects with HIV-1 RNA levels <500 copies/ml tended to be lower, no sequence mutation was correlated with in vivo viral loads. Our results suggest that HIV-1 LTR defects are rare among Italian and Swedish LTNPs."
11119,0.005,1.0000,"Development of HCV infection is typically followed by chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in most patients, while spontaneous HCV viral clearance (SVC) occurs in only a minority of subjects. Compared with the widespread application of HCV RNA testing by quantitative RT-PCR technique, HCV core antigen detection may be an alternative indicator in the diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infections and in monitoring the status of infectious individuals. However, the correlation and differences between these two indicators in HCV infection need more investigation, especially in patients coinfected by HIV-1. In this study, a total of 354 anti-HCV and/or anti-HIV serum positive residents from a village of central China were enrolled. Besides HCV-related hepatopathic variables including clinical status, ALT, AST, anti-HCV Abs, as well as the altered CD4+/CD8+ T cell counts, HCV core antigen and HCV viral load were also measured. The concentration of serum HCV core antigen was highly correlated with level of HCV RNA in CHC patients with or without HIV-1 coinfection. Of note, HCV core antigen concentration was negatively correlated with CD4+ T cell count, while no correlation was found between HCV RNA level and CD4+ T cell count. Our findings suggested that quantitative detection of plasma HCV core antigen may be an alternative indicator of HCV RNA qPCR assay when evaluating the association between HCV replication and host immune status in HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients."
18944,0.005,1.0000,"In the light of increasing prevalence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), anaesthetists are likely to see more patients with this virus in their practice. This study evaluated, using a questionnaire format, the knowledge, attitude and practices of anaesthetists in the management of HIV infected surgical patients. The questionnaire sought demographic information, the knowledge of risks involved as well as attitude and practices. One hundred (66.7%) out of 150 questionnaires distributed amongst members of the Nigerian Society of Anaesthetists were completed and returned. Fifty-five per cent (55%) of the respondents confirmed their willingness to be screened but only 45% had had a personal HIV screening test. Even though 23% of all the respondents will transfuse unscreened blood in an emergency, only 1(8.3%) of the consultants will do so. This trend was also reflected in gloving behaviour as 11(91.6%) of consultants will routinely wear gloves whilst only 12(70.5%) of the senior house officers will routinely glove for venepuncture despite the availability of gloves. Other precautionary facilities such as goggles, sharp disposal bins, routine screening of all surgical patients were more available in private than in government hospitals. Ninety- six per-cent of all respondents will initiate an action after a needle stick injury whilst 4% will ignore. General Anaesthesia was the choice of anaesthetic in an HIV/AIDS infected patient by 43% of respondents whilst 22% of respondents would choose regional technique. However, only 85% of respondents were willing to anaesthetise an infected patient. This study suggested a dearth of knowledge and perception of risks of HIV/AIDs amongst Nigerian Anaesthetists. Appropriate training and greater education is highly recommended. Rigorous infection control policy is imperative and hospital authorities must ensure availability of protective facilities."
4436,0.005,1.0000,"Over a recent three year period, approximately 600 individuals responded to newspaper advertisements for research studies requiring healthy, cocaine using subjects. These subjects were screened using a standard phone interview in order to eliminate individuals with known medical or psychiatric illnesses that would exclude them from ongoing neuroimaging studies of drug abuse. Individuals were specifically asked about their hepatitis and HIV status. Of these, 170 subjects passed the phone screen, having no known medical or psychiatric illness outside of cocaine abuse/dependence and were willing to be further evaluated for the studies. These subjects were brought to the Medical College of Wisconsin's General Clinical Research Center and tested for, among other measures, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. Of these, 144 completed the examination and all testing. In this cohort of assumed healthy subjects, 47 (33%) tested positive for antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Only 7 (5%) tested positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen and 2 (1.4%) to HIV. The demographics of this cohort are 56% African-American, 81% male, 75% never-married, 55% unemployed with a mean age of 36 years. The percentage of subjects reporting any lifetime intravenous drug use among the HCV(+) and the HCV(-) cohorts was 77% vs. 29% respectively. Some routes of HCV transmission are still unclear and may reflect lifestyle or other factors related to cocaine use outside of parenteral drug use. Since almost all HCV infections become chronic, and many progress to chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma, these observations suggest a significant epidemic in an unsuspecting population with little regular access to health care. These individuals also form a large pool for the continued transmission of HCV to the general population. Additional public health interventions are suggested."
2227,0.005,1.0000,"Given the realistic expectations of HIV-infected adolescents and young adults (AYA) to have children and start families, steps must be taken to ensure that youth are prepared to deal with the challenges associated with their HIV and parenting. Literature reviews were conducted to identify published research and practice guidelines addressing parenting or becoming parents among HIV-infected AYA in the United States. Research articles or practice guidelines on this topic were not identified. Given the paucity of information available on this topic, this article provides a framework for the development of appropriate interventions and guidelines for use in clinical and community-based settings. First, the social, economic, and sexual and reproductive health challenges facing HIV-infected AYA in the United States are summarized. Next, family planning considerations, including age-appropriate disclosure of HIV status to those who are perinatally infected, and contraceptive and preconception counseling are described. The impact of early childbearing on young parents is discussed and considerations are outlined during the preconception, antenatal, and postnatal periods with regard to antiretroviral medications and clinical care guidelines. The importance of transitioning AYA from pediatric or adolescent to adult-centered medical care is highlighted. Finally, a comprehensive approach is suggested that addresses not only medical needs but also emphasizes ways to mitigate the impact of social and economic factors on the health and well-being of these young parents and their children."
17610,0.005,1.0000,"Zidovudine (ZDV) administration during pregnancy has been suggested for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission. Reliable levels of the drug have been observed in the fetus and in the newborn. Seven HIV-1-infected pregnant women who declined to have abortions and whose immunological status required antiretroviral treatment were administered oral ZDV 18 mg/kg in four daily doses, the initial dose being administered anytime from the 16th to the 30th week of gestation up until the time of delivery. Follow-up of the seven infants from birth with a mean duration of 22 months (range 16-32 months) revealed mild drug-related toxicity: anemia in two infants and macrocytosis in all seven, both conditions resolved by the second month of life. All infants remained HIV-1 seronegative, according to the 1987 CDC classification, and all stayed clinically well. Other virological parameters including virus culture, in vitro antibody production, and polymerase chain reaction, repeatedly performed in the infants, remained negative. Although none of the mothers transmitted HIV-1 infection to the offspring, the size of this study and the relatively low transmission rate (13%) in Europe do not permit us to draw a definite conclusion about treatment efficacy in preventing maternal-fetal transmission. However, the drug caused only limited toxicity among the infants, and its administration to large numbers of mothers in treatment trials should be considered relatively safe for both mother and child."
14866,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 2, the second AIDS-associated human retrovirus, differs from HIV-1 in its natural history, infectivity, and pathogenicity, as well as in details of its genomic structure and molecular behavior. We report here that HIV-2 inhibits the replication of HIV-1 at the molecular level. This inhibition was selective, dose-dependent, and nonreciprocal. The closely related simian immunodeficiency provirus also inhibited HIV-1. The selectivity of inhibition was shown by the observation that HIV-2 did not significantly downmodulate the expression of the unrelated murine leukemia virus; neither did the murine leukemia virus markedly affect HIV-1 or HIV-2 expression. Moreover, while HIV-2 potently inhibited HIV-1, the reverse did not happen, thus identifying yet another and remarkable difference between HIV-1 and HIV-2. Mutational analysis of the HIV-2 genome suggested that the inhibition follows a complex pathway, possibly involving multiple genes and redundant mechanisms. Introduction of inactivating mutations into the structural and regulatory/accessory genes did not render the HIV-2 provirus ineffective. Some of the HIV-2 gene defects, such as that of tat and rev genes, were phenotypically transcomplemented by HIV-1. The HIV-2 proviruses with deletions in the putative packaging signal and defective for virus replication were effective in inducing the suppressive phenotype. Though the exact mechanism remains to be defined, the inhibition appeared to be mainly due to an intracellular molecular event because it could not be explained solely on the basis of cell surface receptor mediated interference. The results support the notion that the inhibition likely occurred at the level of viral RNA, possibly involving competition between viral RNAs for some transcriptional factor essential for virus replication. Induction of a cytokine is another possibility. These findings might be relevant to the clinical-epidemiological data suggesting that infection with HIV-2 may offer some protection against HIV-1 infection."
1647,0.005,1.0000,"We report a patient, a 23-year-old man, who was a hepatitis B virus(HBV) carrier complicated with nephrotic syndrome. He was admitted to our hospital because of generalized edema and massive ascites. Laboratory data on admission were as follows: proteinuria 9,850 mg/day, Cr 2.7 mg/dl, BUN 73 mg/dl, albumin 1.9 g/dl, cholesterol 501 mg/dl, GOT 23 IU/l, GPT 19 IU/l, HBsAg(+), and HBeAg(222.7). Since his nephrotic symptoms were seriously complicated with renal failure, we selected steroid therapy for nephrosis preference. His renal function was improved and the urinary protein decreased immediately, but his liver function deteriorated. The renal biopsy revealed focal mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. Immunofluorescent examination revealed slight deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 along the glomerular basement membrane and mesangial matrix. He was not compliant and often stopped taking the steroid therapy, thereby causing nephrosis to recur each time. After all, nephrotic symptoms have been well-controlled with cyclosporin and steroid. In spite of the seroconversion of HB virus by formation of HBe antibody, mutant HBV infection continued. The fact that liver biopsy revealed severe lymphoid infiltration at the portal area suggested chronic active hepatitis. His clinicopathologic course suggests that HBV-associated nephropathy does not always remit as there are some cases in whom hepatitis remains in an active state even after seroconversion, due to its mutant status. In these cases, the long-term prognosis of HBV nephropathy has not been defined. Further study is necessary to establish the optimal treatment for HB nephropathy in adults."

This study investigates the lived experience, determinants, and consequences of food insecurity and hunger among individuals living with HIV/AIDS on the shore of Lake Victoria in Suba District, Kenya. Parallel mixed methods included semi-structured interviews and administration of the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale among a systematic sample of 67 persons living with HIV/AIDS (49 of whom were receiving antiretroviral therapy [ART]). All respondents were either severely (79.1%) or moderately (20.9%) food insecure; no respondents were mildly food insecure or food secure. Qualitative data and simple and multiple linear regression models indicated that significant determinants of food insecurity include increased age, a greater number of children, and not being married. A number of themes related to food insecurity and ART emerged, including: (1) an increase in hunger or appetite since initiating ART; (2) exacerbation of ART-related side effects; and (3) non-adherence to ART due to hunger, food insecurity, or agricultural work responsibilities. HIV interventions should address food insecurity and hunger, particularly among at-risk populations, to promote ART adherence and better health outcomes."

In 2005, the first episode of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), as assessed by parasitological diagnosis of bone marrow aspirate, was recorded. When admitted to the hospital, the patient presented fever, hepatosplenomegaly, weight loss, and diarrhea. Since then, six additional episodes of VL occurred, with a frequency rate of one per year (2005-2012, except in 2008). In 2011, the patient presented a disseminated skin lesion caused by the amastigotes of Leishmania, as identified by histopathological assessment of skin biopsy samples. In 2005, he was treated with N-methyl-glucamine-antimony and amphotericin B deoxycholate. However, since 2006 because of a reported toxicity, the drug of choice was liposomal amphotericin B. As recommended by the Ministry of Health, this report emphasizes the need for HIV patients living in VL endemic areas to include this parasitosis in their follow-up protocol, particularly after the first infection of VL."
18123,0.005,1.0000,"In an 8-month period nine patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were diagnosed as having visceral leishmaniasis; all diagnoses were based on cultures (eight from bone marrow and one from the skin). Visceral leishmaniasis developed before full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in seven patients and at the same time as or after AIDS in the other two patients. Three patients had a history of leishmaniasis. Clinical manifestations and laboratory findings were atypical. Leishmania species were cultured from samples taken from all patients; however, six patients had an insignificant antileishmanial antibody titer and Leishmania amastigotes were not seen in their bone marrow smears. Four isolates were identified by isoenzyme analysis as Leishmania donovani infantum. Five patients died, including two patients who had completed at least one 3-week course of therapy with N-methylglucamine antimoniate. Screening should be done for visceral leishmaniasis in patients with HIV infection who live or travel in areas where the disease is endemic. The diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis may frequently be missed if cultures are not done."
8188,0.005,1.0000,"In this cross-sectional survey conducted at the end of 1997 among the physicians of participants of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS), 1487 of 2154 patients (69.0%) were treated with highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) defined as triple therapy with a combination of one or two reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and one or two protease inhibitors; 541 patients (25.1%) had never received such treatment. The physician's perception that the patient would not comply with treatment was one reason for not prescribing HAART to 20% of these patients (110). Physicians indicated that the most common reasons for the patient to refuse HAART were the fear of side effects (18%) and the patient's perception that treatment was too complicated (18%). Among 126 patients (5.8%) no longer receiving HAART, the most common reasons for discontinuing treatment were actual side effects (61%) or the fear of side effects (25%). Overall, 16% of patients did not receive therapy in accord with official Swiss guidelines. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that patients with lower education, active intravenous drug users outside of a drug substitution program, and those who acquired HIV infection through intravenous drug use had a significantly higher risk of inadequate treatment. The physician's judgment of patient adherence and the physician's perception of the patient's fear of side effects are critical for the prescription of HAART. Physicians should address these issues to prevent unilateral withholding of treatment and increase the proportion of patients who may benefit from current antiretroviral therapy."
9007,0.005,1.0000,"In resourced settings with access to highly active antiretroviral therapy, perinatally acquired HIV-1 infection has become a chronic disease of childhood with increasing numbers of adolescents surviving to adulthood and transitioning from pediatric to adult services.

The longer term impact of exposure to HIV and antiretroviral therapy throughout childhood are becoming apparent, with growing concern over neurocognitive, cardiovascular, renal and bone health. Careful follow-up of this early perinatal cohort as they enter adulthood will inform the future management of the growing numbers of adolescents surviving worldwide as access to therapy increases."
7092,0.005,1.0000,"Approximately 30% of patients participating in the national antiretroviral therapy (ART) program in Argentina fail to achieve an undetectable viral load, and approximately 25% are not retained in care. This qualitative study was designed to explore and identify factors associated with engagement and retention in public and private health care in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Qualitative data from key informants (n = 12) and focus groups (n = 4 groups) of patients and providers from private and public HIV treatment facilities were recorded and transcribed. Predetermined and arising themes related to adherence, engagement, and retention in care were coded and analyzed using qualitative data analysis software. Reasons identified for patients' lack of adherence or engagement in care differed between patients and providers, and patients attributed limitations to low self-efficacy, fear and concerns about HIV, and lack of provider involvement in treatment. In contrast, providers viewed themselves as decision-makers in patient care and patients as responsible for their own nonadherence due to lack of commitment to their own health or due to medication side effects. Patients reported health care system limitations and HIV concerns contributed to a lack of engagement, and providers identified limited HIV literacy and stigma as additional problems. Both agreed that chronic illness and substance addiction impacted adherence and retention, and agreed on the importance of trust, honesty, and communication in the patient-provider relationship. Results support the incorporation of system-, provider-, and patient-focused components into interventions to facilitate patient engagement, adherence, and retention in public and private settings in Argentina.

14977,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-related bone marrow changes are consistent with myelodysplastic features (MDF). Their pathogenesis may differ from primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and is associated with various factors including the virus itself or the antiretroviral therapy. In order to evaluate the differences between HIV-related MDF and MDS, the morphological changes in peripheral blood and bone marrow, cytogenetic analysis and the response to anaemia treatment were studied in 158 HIV+ patients with haemophilia and the results were compared with those of 61 patients with primary MDS (31 with RA, 10 with RARS, 11 with RAEB, three with RAEB-t and six with CMML). The eligibility criteria for patients with MDS were primary MDS, Hb levels < 10 g dL(-1), and no significant organ disease. The peripheral blood and bone marrow examination revealed MDF in 44 HIV-infected haemophilic patients (27.8%). The median time from seroconversion was 12.5 years and the mean time under AZT therapy was 44.1 months. Nineteen of these patients (43.1%) had Hb levels < 10 g dL(-1), while neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 29.5% and 25%, respectively. Every patient of this study with Hb < 10 g dL(-1) received erythropoietin (Epo). There were statistically significant morphological alterations between HIV-related MDF and MDS: hypocellularity, plasmatocytosis and eosinophilia were more pronounced in HIV haemophiliacs with MDF, while dysplasia of erythroblasts, megakaryocytes and granulocytes was more frequent in MDS patients. No HIV haemophilic patient with MDF had more than 5% blasts in the bone marrow nor did any develop RAEB or acute leukaemia during the period of this study. The cytogenetic analysis was normal in HIV-infected patients with haemophilia whereas 42.6% of patients with MDS had an abnormal karyotype. Complete erythroid response was achieved with Epo administration in 84.2% of HIV+ haemophilic patients with anaemia compared to 19.7% of patients with MDS. These data suggest that bone marrow changes in long-term HIV patients have different characteristics from primary MDS and constitute the entity for which the name HIV-myelopathy has been proposed in the literature."

Whether substituting rilpivirine for nevirapine has dyslipidemic consequences and alters CVD risk is unknown. The aim of this prospective open-label clinical trial was to evaluate serum lipids, cardiovascular risks, and lipid treatment goals over 48 weeks after switching from nevirapine to rilpivirine. Fifty HIV-1-suppressed patients on stable once-daily nevirapine plus emtricitabine/tenofovir-DF were switched to single-tablet rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir-DF. Lifestyle, weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), ≥6 h overnight fasting lipids, 10-year Framingham risk scores (FRS), and Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III) lipid goals were evaluated over 48 weeks. Patients were 82% males, were a median of 45 years of age, and were on nevirapine for a median of 66 months. Diets, exercise levels, body mass index, and smoking status did not change during follow-up. At week 24, significant changes (p<0.001) were seen in mean [95% confidence interval (CI)] total cholesterol (-0.67 mmol/liter, CI: -0.50 to -0.83), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.36, CI: -0.21 to -0.51), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.28, CI: -0.20 to -0.35). The total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio increased 0.20 (CI: 0.02 to 0.37; p=0.029). Triglycerides did not change and the SBP decreased 6 mmHg (CI: -1.7 to -10.3; p=0.007). Week 48 lipid profiles and SBP were similar to week 24. The median FRS did not change during follow-up (-0.7%, p=0.119). More patients achieved ATP-III low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+14.9%; p=0.016) and total cholesterol goals (+25.5%; p<0.001).

10561,0.005,1.0000,"Propensity for developing coronary heart disease (CHD) is linked with Framingham-defined cardiovascular risk factors and elevated inflammatory biomarkers. Cardiovascular risk and inflammatory biomarkers were evaluated in ARIES, a Phase IIIb/IV clinical trial in which 515 antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected subjects initially received abacavir/lamivudine + atazanavir/ritonavir for 36 weeks. Subjects who were virologically suppressed by week 30 were randomized 1:1 at week 36 to either maintain or discontinue ritonavir for an additional 108 weeks. Framingham 10-year CHD risk scores (FRS) and risk category of <6% or ≥6%, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were assessed at baseline, week 84, and week 144. Biomarkers were stratified by FRS category. When ritonavir-boosted/nonboosted treatment groups were combined, median hsCRP did not change significantly between baseline (1.6 mg/liter) and week 144 (1.4 mg/liter) in subjects with FRS <6% (p=0.535) or with FRS ≥6% (1.9 mg/liter vs. 2.0 mg/liter, respectively; p=0.102). Median IL-6 was similar for subjects with FRS <6% (p=0.267) at baseline (1.6 pg/ml) and week 144 (1.4 pg/ml) and for FRS ≥6% (2.0 pg/ml vs. 2.2 pg/ml, respectively; p=0.099). Median Lp-PLA(2) decreased significantly (p<0.001) between baseline (197 nmol/min/ml) and week 144 (168 nmol/min/ml) in subjects with FRS <6% and with FRS ≥6% (238 nmol/min/ml vs. 175 nmol/min/ml, respectively; p<0.001). In conclusion, in antiretroviral-naive subjects treated with abacavir-based therapy for 144 weeks, median inflammatory biomarker levels for hsCRP and IL-6 generally remained stable with no significant difference between baseline and week 144 for subjects with either FRS <6% or FRS ≥6%.

10388,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved the prognosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients but is associated with severe adverse events, such as lipodystrophy and insulin resistance. Rosiglitazone did not increase subcutaneous fat in patients with HAART-associated lipodystrophy (HAL) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, although it attenuated insulin resistance and decreased liver fat content. The aim of this study was to examine effects of rosiglitazone on gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue in 30 patients with HAL. The mRNA concentrations in subcutaneous adipose tissue were measured using real-time PCR. Twenty-four-week treatment with rosiglitazone (8 mg/day) compared with placebo significantly increased the expression of adiponectin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), and PPARgamma coactivator 1 and decreased IL-6 expression. Expression of other genes involved in lipogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, or glucose transport, such as acyl-CoA synthase, adipocyte lipid-binding protein, CD45, fatty acid transport protein-1 and -4, GLUT1, GLUT4, keratinocyte lipid-binding protein, lipoprotein lipase, PPARdelta, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, remained unchanged. Rosiglitazone also significantly increased serum adiponectin concentration. The change in serum adiponectin concentration was inversely correlated with the change in fasting serum insulin concentration and liver fat content. In conclusion, rosiglitazone induced significant changes in gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue and ameliorated insulin resistance in patients with HAL. Increased expression of adiponectin might have mediated most of the favorable insulin-sensitizing effects of rosiglitazone in these patients."

Zidovudine with IFN-alpha (n = 25) had a favorable effect on CD4+ cell counts compared with zidovudine alone (n = 20). At all time points analyzed, the mean change from baseline was higher, reaching significance at week 24 (+10% versus -21%; P = .029). At week 48 the difference was -12% versus -45% (P = .07). Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody-induced T cell reactivity improved temporarily in both groups. Serum HIV p24 antigen levels decreased maximally during the first 12 weeks of treatment. At weeks 0 and 48, polymerase chain reaction analysis for mutations at codons 67 and 215 of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase gene conferring zidovudine resistance was conducted in 10 subjects receiving zidovudine and in 8 subjects receiving combination therapy. At week 48, 1 of 8 and 4 of 6 samples from the groups receiving zidovudine only or combination therapy, respectively, contained wild type virus at codon 215. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was uncommon.

This was a randomized, open-label trial with subjects assigned to fenofibrate 200 mg (n = 88) or pravastatin 40 mg (n = 86) daily. Subjects who failed to reach the NCEP composite goal on monotherapy by week 12 received both drugs. The composite goal at week 12 was achieved in 1% of fenofibrate and 5% of pravastatin subjects. At week 16, 69/88 subjects on fenofibrate added pravastatin (FP) and 67/86 subjects on pravastatin added fenofibrate (PF). At week 48, 7% FP subjects and 3% PF subjects achieved the composite goal. Median changes in LDL/HDL/TG/non-HDL were -8/+5/-144/+50 and -14/+2/-66/+34 mg/dl in subjects receiving FP and PF, respectively. There were few adverse events and no rhabdomyolysis reported. Combination therapy with fenofibrate and pravastatin for HIV-related dyslipidemia provides substantial improvements in lipid parameters and appears safe, but is unlikely to achieve all NCEP targets for lipid levels."

One patient had no prior illness or antibody test results that were suggestive of HIV infection; for two other patients who were known to have antibody to HIV, an AIDS-defining diagnosis had never been made. Three patients had pneumonia (two with bacteremia and one with empyema), one had malignant otitis externa, and three had bacteremia that either resulted from or caused secondarily a soft-tissue focus of infection. Two patients died, and two others experienced one or more relapses after an initial course of treatment.

In the present study, genotype and phenotype data from ART-naïve and experienced hospitalized patients infected with HIV in Tehran, Iran were used to assess the prevalence and types of transmitted (TDR) and acquired drug resistance (ADR) mutations. All 30 participants naïve to ART and 62 of 70 (88.6%) participants receiving ART had detectable viral loads. Among participants receiving ART with sequencing data available (n = 62), 36 (58.1%) had at least one drug resistance mutation; the most common mutations were K103N (21.0%), M184V (19.4%), and the thymidine analogue mutations. Seven (11.3%), 27 (43.5%), and two (3.2%) of these participants had resistance to one, two, and three drug classes, respectively. High-level resistance to efavirenz (EFV) was more common among participants on EFV-based regimens than high-level lopinavir/ritonivar (LPV/r) resistance among those on LPV/r-based regimens (55.3% vs. 6.7%, P < 0.0001). Two (6.7%) antiretroviral-naïve participants had K103N mutations. These findings document an alarmingly high frequency of multiple HIV drug class resistance in Iran, confirm the presence of TDR, and highlight the need for systematic viral load monitoring and drug resistance testing, including at diagnosis.

The efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF single-tablet regimen is the first once-daily, single-tablet, triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) formulation available for the treatment of HIV infection and, in the EU, is indicated for use in adults infected with HIV-1 who have been virologically suppressed for >3 months on their current ART regimen. In treatment-experienced adults with HIV-1 infection already virologically suppressed with ART, switching to once-daily triple combination therapy with efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF (including the single-tablet regimen) is effective in maintaining virological suppression and is generally well tolerated, according to several randomized, open-label or noncomparative multicentre trials and an open-label extension study of up to 96 weeks' duration. Moreover, additional data from some of these studies indicate that adherence to treatment was maintained or improved after switching to the once-daily triple combination, with patients generally preferring the efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF single-tablet regimen over their previous more complex regimen and (in one of two trials) finding it easier to follow. Thus, the efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF single-tablet regimen provides a convenient once-daily regimen for use in treatment-experienced adults that may confer an advantage over more complex or frequently administered regimens for which adherence to treatment is an issue."

Two thirds of participants experienced a crime-related event, and nearly one third reported exposure to physical and/or sexual trauma. All three types of exposure were related to HIV stigma and to concerns about initiating ART. Associations between exposure and social support and HIV disclosure needs were also observed. Findings have implications for the role of trauma exposure and efforts to optimize treatment engagement for HIV-infected MSM. "
16926,0.005,1.0000,"The clinical consequences of androgen deficiency in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women remain underappreciated. The pharmacokinetics of transdermally administered testosterone in premenopausal women and HIV-infected women have not been studied. In this study we compared the pharmacokinetics of a novel testosterone matrix transdermal system (TMTDS) in healthy premenopausal women and women infected with HIV. Eight menstruating HIV-infected women, 18-50 yr of age, who had been receiving stable antiretroviral therapy, including a protease inhibitor, for at least 12 weeks and nine healthy, menstruating women of comparable age were enrolled. After baseline sampling during a 24-h control period in the early follicular phase (days 1-6), two TMTDS patches were applied with an expected delivery rate of 300 microg testosterone daily over an application period of 3-4 days. After 72 h, the patches were removed, a second set of two patches was applied, and blood samples were drawn over 96 h. Baseline serum total and free testosterone levels were lower in HIV-infected women than in healthy women. A diurnal rhythm of testosterone secretion, with higher levels in the morning and lower levels in the late afternoon, was apparent in both groups of women. Free testosterone levels were in the midnormal range at baseline in healthy women and increased above the upper limit of normal during TMTDS application. In HIV-infected women, free testosterone levels were in the low normal range at baseline and rose into the upper normal range during patch application. Serum total testosterone levels increased into the midnormal range in HIV-infected women and into the upper normal range in healthy women during patch application. The mean increments in free and total testosterone levels were significantly lower in HIV-infected women than in healthy women. Testosterone bioavailability, expressed as the mean +/- SEM baseline-subtracted area under the total testosterone curve, was significantly greater in healthy women than in HIV-infected women [3323 +/- 566 ng/dL x h (115 +/- 20 nmol/L x h) vs. 1506 +/- 316 ng/dL x h (52 +/- 11 nmol/ L x h); P = 0.016]. Assuming a daily testosterone delivery rate of 300 microg/day, the apparent plasma clearance was significantly higher in HIV-infected women than in healthy women (2531 +/- 469 vs. 1127 +/- 217 L/day1 P = 0.022), respectively. There was no significant change from baseline in serum LH, sex hormone-binding globulin, and estradiol levels in either group. Serum FSH levels showed a greater decrease from baseline in healthy women. A regimen of two testosterone patches applied twice a week can maintain serum total and free testosterone levels in the mid- to upper normal range, respectively, in HIV-infected women with low testosterone levels. During TMTDS application, the increments in serum total and free testosterone levels are lower in HIV-infected women than in healthy women, presumably due to increased plasma clearance or decreased absorption. Further studies are needed to assess the effects of physiological androgen replacement in HIV-infected women."
525,0.005,1.0000,"Intestinal mucosal immune system is an early target for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, resulting in CD4(+) T-cell depletion, deterioration of gut lining, and fecal microbiota composition. We evaluated the effects of a prebiotic oligosaccharide mixture in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-naive HIV-1-infected adults. In a pilot double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 57 HAART-naive HIV-1-infected patients received a unique oligosaccharide mixture (15 or 30 g short chain galactooligosaccharides/long chain fructooligosaccharides/pectin hydrolysate-derived acidic oligosaccharides (scGOS/lcFOS/pAOS) daily) or a placebo for 12 weeks. Microbiota composition improved significantly with increased bifidobacteria, decreased Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium rectale cluster, and decreased pathogenic Clostridium lituseburense/Clostridium histolyticum group levels upon prebiotic supplementation. In addition, a reduction of soluble CD14 (sCD14), activated CD4(+)/CD25(+) T cells, and significantly increased natural killer (NK) cell activity when compared with control group were seen in the treatment group. The results of this pilot trial highly significantly show that dietary supplementation with a prebiotic oligosaccharide mixture results in improvement of the gut microbiota composition, reduction of sCD14, CD4(+) T-cell activation (CD25), and improved NK cell activity in HAART-naive HIV-infected individuals."
1882,0.005,1.0000,"A recent clinical trial of a T-cell-based AIDS vaccine delivered with recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) vectors showed no efficacy in lowering viral load and was associated with increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Preexisting immunity to Ad5 in humans could therefore affect both immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy. We hypothesized that vaccine-induced immunity is differentially affected, depending on whether subjects were exposed to Ad5 by natural infection or by vaccination. Serum samples from vaccine trial subjects receiving a DNA/rAd5 AIDS vaccine with or without prior immunity to Ad5 were examined for the specificity of their Ad5 neutralizing antibodies and their effect on HIV-1 immune responses. Here, we report that rAd5 neutralizing antibodies were directed to different components of the virion, depending on whether they were elicited by natural infection or vaccination in HIV vaccine trial subjects. Neutralizing antibodies elicited by natural infection were directed largely to the Ad5 fiber, while exposure to rAd5 through vaccination elicited antibodies primarily to capsid proteins other than fiber. Notably, preexisting immunity to Ad5 fiber from natural infection significantly reduced the CD4 and CD8 cell responses to HIV Gag after DNA/rAd5 vaccination. The specificity of Ad5 neutralizing antibodies therefore differs depending on the route of exposure, and natural Ad5 infection compromises Ad5 vaccine-induced immunity to weak immunogens, such as HIV-1 Gag. These results have implications for future AIDS vaccine trials and the design of next-generation gene-based vaccine vectors."
4774,0.005,1.0000,"An estimated 56,000 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections occur each year in the United States. Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for 53% of the estimated incident infections, and surveillance data suggest that the annual number of new HIV infections among MSM has been rising since the mid-1990s. Strategies for reducing acquisition of HIV infection by MSM have included 1) expanded HIV testing so that infected persons can be treated and their risk for transmitting infection minimized; 2) individual, small-group, and community-level behavioral interventions to reduce risk behaviors; 3) promotion of condom use; 4) detection and treatment of sexually transmitted infections; and 5) mental health and substance abuse counseling when needed. On November 23, 2010, investigators for the Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Initiative (iPrEX) study announced results from a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial of daily oral antiretrovirals (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF] and emtricitabine [FTC]) to prevent acquisition of HIV infection among uninfected but exposed MSM. This report provides interim guidance to health-care providers based on the reported results of that trial, which indicated that TDF plus FTC taken orally once a day as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is safe and partially effective in reducing HIV acquisition among MSM when provided with regular monitoring of HIV status and ongoing risk-reduction and PrEP medication adherence counseling."
12529,0.005,1.0000,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial agent used to treat patients with autoimmune diseases, has been shown to suppress human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in T cells and monocytes in vitro by inhibiting posttranscriptional modification of the virus. An initial randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in 38 asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients who had CD4+ counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm3 demonstrated that the amount of recoverable virus declined significantly in the HCQ group compared with the placebo group over the 8-week study period. These preliminary observations were expanded into a second 16-week clinical trial comparing the efficacy of HCQ with that of zidovudine (ZDV) in 72 asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients with CD4+ counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm3. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either HCQ 800 mg/d (n = 35) or ZDV 500 mg/d (n = 37) for 16 weeks. No adverse reactions to the study medications were observed in either the HCQ or ZDV group. Patients in both groups had reduced levels of recoverable HIV-1 RNA in the plasma, reduced levels of cultured virus, and reduced levels of serum p24 antigen after the 16-week study period. However, no difference was noted in absolute CD4+ counts between the two groups. Interleukin-6 and serum immunoglobulin G levels were significantly reduced in the HCQ group but not in the ZDV group. These findings support the results of the previous clinical trial. Thus HCQ may be potentially useful in the treatment of patients with HIV-1 infection."

10051,0.005,1.0000,"People living with HIV with a history of drug use face additional psychosocial challenges that could compromise their adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study examined ART treatment adherence and adherence self-efficacy among people living with HIV with a history of drug use in Vietnam. We used cross-sectional baseline data collected between October 2014 and February 2015 from a randomized controlled trial in Vietnam. Of the 900 persons with a history of drug use in the trial, a sample of 109 people living with HIV currently on ART were included in the study. The vast majority (92%) of the participants reported not missing any medications in the past 30 days. Multiple regression results indicated that social support was positively associated with adherence self-efficacy (β = 0.420, P < 0.001) and general adherence to ART (β = 0.201, P = 0.0368). General adherence to ART was negatively associated with depressive symptoms (β = -0.188, P = 0.046) and current heroin use (β = -0.196, P = 0.042). These findings underscore the importance of addressing mental health and social challenges facing people living with HIV with a history of drug use to promote ART treatment adherence. Clinical management of HIV should identify and address concurrent substance use behaviors to maximize adherence and treatment outcomes."
4634,0.005,1.0000,"We examined the effect of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific immune-based therapy in Thailand, where access to antiviral drug therapy is limited. A 40-week trial was conducted with 297 asymptomatic, HIV-infected Thai subjects with CD4-cell counts greater than 300 microl/mm(3). Subjects were randomized to receive either HIV type 1 (HIV-1) immunogen (Remune; inactivated HIV-1 from which gp120 is depleted in incomplete Freund's adjuvant or adjuvant control at 0, 12, 24, and 36 weeks at five different clinical sites in Thailand. Neither group received antiviral drug therapy. The a priori primary endpoint for the trial was changes in CD4-cell counts with secondary parameters of percent changes in CD8-cell counts (percent CD4, CD8, and CD4/CD8) and body weight. Subsets of subjects were also examined for changes in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, Western blot immunoreactivity, and HIV-1 delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test reactivity. There was a significant difference in changes in CD4-cell counts that favored the HIV-1 immunogen-treated group compared to those for the adjuvant-treated control group (P<0.05). On average, for HIV-1 immunogen-treated subjects CD4-cell counts increased by 84 cells by week 40, whereas the increase for the control group was 38 cells by week 40. This increase in CD4-cell count was associated with increased HIV-specific immunogenicity, as shown by Western blotting and enhanced HIV-1 DTH skin reactivity. No significant differences in adverse events were observed between the groups. The results of this trial suggest that HIV-1 immunogen is safe and significantly increases CD4-cell counts and HIV-specific immunity compared to those achieved with the adjuvant control in asymptomatic HIV-1-infected subjects not taking antiviral drugs."

1637,0.005,1.0000,"Acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a transient illness that typically presents with mucocutaneous and constitutional symptoms. It is soon followed by seroconversion with the detection of anti-HIV antibodies in the peripheral blood. To better understand the pathogenetic events leading to this clinical picture, we sought to investigate the (immuno)histologic features of the skin rash occurring in an acutely infected person. A skin biopsy of an acutely infected person was investigated histologically and immunohistologically using paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Interface dermatitis with pronounced vacuolization of the basal keratinocytes was a prominent histological finding. The inflammatory infiltrate was composed of CD3+/CD8+ T cells with coexpression of Granzyme B7 and TIA-1, and CD68+ histiocytes/dendritic cells. CD1a+ intraepidermal Langerhans cells (LC) were significantly decreased and individual LC coexpressed HIV-p24 antigens as evidenced in double labeling experiments. HIV-infected LC were demonstrated in close apposition to cytotoxic T cells. This study provides the first definitive evidence for infection of LC at extramucosal sites in this very early stage of disease. Our findings emphasize the critical role of dendritic cells as a virus reservoir and the skin as a major site of HIV replication during the course of the disease."
2088,0.005,1.0000,"Blood lipids and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) are used to assess cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. We evaluated in a cross-sectional design the relationship of hsCRP to markers of liver function (aspartate and alanine transaminases [AST and ALT, respectively]), CVD risk factors and HIV-disease progression markers in 226 HIV-1 sero-positive drug users. hsCRP showed a significant inverse relationship with ALT and high-density lipoprotein, independent of age, gender, viral load, CD4 cell-count and antiretroviral (ARV) use, and was not significantly associated with HIV-disease progression markers. Serum markers of liver damage, AST and ALT, were associated with lower hsCRP, total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins and triglycerides. Elevated liver enzymes (> or =40 IU/L) were predictive of hsCRP levels that are considered a low risk for CVD. In conclusion, hsCRP may not be a reliable marker of CVD risk in populations with HIV at-risk for elevated liver enzymes due to high hepatitis B virus/hepatitis C virus prevalence and ARV use."
8992,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment options for HIV-infected patients can be limited due to viral drug resistance to antiretroviral agents. Enfuvirtide (ENF) is an injectable entry/fusion inhibitor that is effective in achieving viral suppression when used in combination with protease inhibitors (PIs) in patients with pre-existing resistance. However, ENF treatment is associated with injection site reactions and dosing fatigue. This multicenter, open-label, Phase IIIb, 48-week pilot study assessed safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of the PI darunavir (DRV), boosted with ritonavir (DRV/r), and the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) etravirine (ETR), when substituted for ENF/PI (±NNRTI)-based therapy. Ten virologically suppressed (HIV RNA less than 50 copies/ml) men who were intolerant to ENF were enrolled. Median (range) CD4+ count was 301 (187-663) cells/mm(3). Two patients discontinued the study; all remaining patients maintained a viral load of less than 50 copies/ml at Week 48. Viral load increased to greater than 50 copies/ml in two patients, but was eventually re-suppressed without the need for changes in treatment. Median (range) increase (last observation carried forward) in CD4+ count from baseline to Week 48 was 64 (-53-100) cells/mm(3). Two grade 3 adverse events (AEs), nausea and weight loss, and one serious AE, acute cholecystitis, were reported; each AE resolved without treatment interruption. Most common AEs related to study drug were fatigue, rash, headache, and diarrhea. Decreases in triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein, were observed. This study suggests that a DRV/r- and ETR-based regimen can be substituted for an ENF-based regimen while maintaining virologic suppression."
20004,0.005,1.0000,Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) share similar routes of transmission making it possible for an individual to have a co-infection. HBV infection is well known to be a major cause of chronic liver diseases worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HBV infection among HIV infected HAART naïve patients and investigate the effect of co-infection on CD4 count and liver function.
11614,0.005,1.0000,"The identification of clinical risk factors for AIDS in patients with preserved immune function is of significant interest. We examined whether patients with fungal infection (FI) and CD4 cell count >or=200/microl were at higher risk of disease progression in the era of cART. 11,009 EuroSIDA patients were followed from their first CD4 cell count >or=200/microl after 1 January 1997 until progression to any non-azoles/amphotericin B susceptible (AAS) AIDS disease, last visit or death. Initiation of antimycotic therapy (AMT) was used as a marker of FI and was modelled as a time-updated covariate using Poisson regression. After adjustment for current CD4 cell count, HIV-RNA, starting cART and diagnosis of AAS-AIDS, AMT was significantly associated with an increased incidence of non-AAS-AIDS (IRR=1.55, 95% CI 1.17-2.06, p=0.0024). Despite low incidence of AIDS in the cART era, FI in patients with a CD4 cell count >or=200/microl is associated with a 55% higher risk of non-AAS-AIDS (95% confidence interval 1.17-2.06, p=0.0024). These data suggest that patients with FI are more immune compromized than would be expected from their CD4 cell count alone. FI can be used as a clinical marker for disease progression and indirect indicator for initiation/changing cART in settings where laboratory facilities are limited."
12405,0.005,1.0000,"Serum cytokine profiles, T-cell subsets, and general parameters of immune activation were evaluated in 15 patients with acute primary HIV-1 infection, and compared with those obtained from 18 patients with acute primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and from 18 control subjects in order to elucidate possible defects of immune response to HIV in early phases of virus-host interaction. Mean CD4+ cell count, serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, 5'-neopterin, and beta 2-microglobulin were significantly lower in acute HIV-1 infection than in EBV infection. Both acute HIV-1 and EBV infections were characterized by significantly higher mean CD8+ cell count and soluble CD8 antigen (sCD8) levels compared to control subjects, while acute HIV-1 infection was accompanied by the highest interferon (IFN)-gamma serum concentrations. In primary HIV-1 infection, significant impairment of CD4+- mediated T-helper function may lead to viral escape and persistence of infection despite an early and vigorous CD8+ T-lymphocyte activation."
12126,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to assess whether the density of CD38 antigen expression on CD8+ T cells can be used as a marker of activation of the immune system in Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-positive patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). T cell subsets, expression of CD38 antigen on CD8+T cells, HIV-1 viral load and stage of the disease were analyzed at baseline and after 12 months of HAART in 24 HIV-1-infected patients. Our data showed that the use of HAART is effective in reducing plasma viral load and in achieving a stable CD4+ count and percentage of CD8+/CD38+ cells. The percentages of CD8/CD38+ cells in HIV-1-infected patients at baseline and after 12 months of HAART were significantly higher than those of controls. Analysis of the density of CD38 expression revealed that it was due to CD8+/CD38+ subsets with low and medium density of antigen expression. Absolute number of CD4+ T cells correlated negatively with the percentage of CD8+/CD38+ cells at baseline of the study. Persistent up-regulation of the CD38 expression on CD8+ T cells and its correlation with the decreased CD4+ count despite the reduction of plasma viral load may reflect residual replication of HIV-1 in reservoirs. Thus, this immunological parameter can serve as a biological marker of HIV-1 infection and might have utility in clinical management of HIV-1-infected persons."
9900,0.005,1.0000,"The occurrence of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals with high CD4+ counts indicates poor immunologic function. Thrush and persistent fever, easily recognized clinically, are potential measures of immunocompetence. This analysis establishes the complex interactions of CD4+ count, thrush, and persistent fever to predict the occurrence of PCP. Analyses used 20,632 person visits from 2,568 HIV-1-seropositive homosexual or bisexual men participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Comprehensive examinations were conducted semiannually, while occurrences of PCP were assessed continuously. The occurrence of thrush and fever increase in frequency as CD4+ levels decrease. The relative hazard of PCP in the presence of thrush compared with the absence of thrush rises (p < 0.05) from 1 for the lowest CD4+ category to approximately 5 in the highest categories. The relative hazard of PCP in the presence of fever compared with the absence of fever is above one (p < 0.05) in all CD4+ categories. No cases of PCP occurred in individuals on PCP prophylaxis with CD4+ counts > 200/mm3. These results suggest that HIV-1-related symptoms provide a measure of failing immune function that is not reflected by enumeration of CD4+ lymphocytes alone and support the United States Public Health Service recommendation that symptomatic individuals with CD4+ counts > 200/mm3 should be considered for PCP prophylaxis."
19807,0.005,1.0000,"Using our recently developed target system model of env gene-transfected cells for gp120/41-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays, we evaluated the ADCC effector function of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in 39 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals. The natural killer (NK) activity of the PBMC from these individuals against K562 was also determined. A significant positive correlation (p < or = 0.05, r = 0.37) was found between these two activities. On the basis of our data, we built a regression equation for the two activities whereby the ADCC effector function of PBMC of an HIV-infected individual can be predicted from their NK activity. We also found that the endpoint titer of a given serum for ADCC-mediating antibodies in the ADCC assay varied depending on the NK activity of the effector cells used: The effectors with high NK activity tended to give higher titers as compared with the effectors with low NK activity. To our knowledge, this is the first formal documentation of the existence of a positive correlation between the ADCC and NK activities of the PBMC. It also shows that the ADCC titer of serum in ADCC assay may vary depending on the NK activity of the effector cells used. This observation underscores an important variable of ADCC assays. Using our statistical model, one can predict the ADCC effector function of the PBMC from HIV-infected individuals from their NK activity and thus help clarify the role of this important immune response in HIV infection and AIDS prognosis."

Viral load tests provide a picture of viral activity, while CD4 cell counts shed light on the immune status and can help physicians to prevent the development of opportunistic infections in patients. On the other hand, genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing and therapeutic drug monitoring help to optimize HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy.

3683,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation is the frequent complication after cytotoxic chemotherapy in HBsAg-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients. Pre-chemotherapy viral load may be a risk factor and HBeAg-positive status is associated with increased viral load. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term treatment outcome of lamivudine in preventing HBV reactivation and its associated morbidity according to HBeAg status. Twenty-four adult HBsAg-positive NHL patients were taken 100 mg of lamivudine daily before the initiation of chemotherapy. The median duration of lamivudine therapy was 11.5 months (range: 1-54 months) and the median number of chemotherapy cycles was 6 (range: 1-16 cycles). The steroid containing chemotherapy regimens were used in 18 patients (75%), and the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody containing chemotherapy regimen was used in 6 patients (25%). Four patients received autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation without resultant HBV reactivation. Hepatitis related to HBV reactivation was developed in 1 patient among 14 HBeAg-positive patients and no one among 10 HBeAg-negative. One patient developed HBV reactivation after lamivudine withdrawal, and 4 patients developed the YMDD (tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate) mutation during lamivudine therapy. There were no statistical differences in HBV reactivation rate during chemotherapy according to the HBeAg status. Our results demonstrate that lamivudine should be considered preemptively before the chemotherapy for all HBsAg-positive NHL patients to prevent HBV reactivation, regardless of pre-chemotherapy HBeAg status. Finally, compared with the chronic hepatitis B patients, similar rate of HBV reactivation after lamivudine withdrawal and development of YMDD mutation was observed in NHL patients."
12816,0.005,1.0000,"Many HIV-infected patients fail to achieve undetectable viral load and are not retained in care. This pilot study examined patients lost to care in public and private clinics in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The impact of patient and provider interventions was compared separately and collectively. In Phase 1, participants prescribed antiretrovirals and non-adherent to treatment in the prior 3-6 months (n = 60) were randomized to patient intervention or standard of care (SOC) and assessed over 12 months. In Phase 2, providers were trained in interviewing techniques and 60 additional patients were randomized to patient intervention or SOC condition. Averaged across patient intervention status, Phase 2 provider intervention patients reported the most improved adherence and viral suppression at 6 and 12 months. Adherence in ""patient intervention only"" improved at midpoint and returned to baseline at 12 months. Results suggest provider training sustained patient adherence and viral suppression among ""hard to reach"" patients."
17586,0.005,1.0000,"Structured therapeutic interruption (STI) has been offered to HIV-1 infected patients with virological failure (viral load > 1500 copies/mL) of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) (three or four drugs for at least one year). CD4 lymphocyte count, HIV-1 viral load, clinical status, were assessed every month during STI and after ART reintroduction. Genotype analysis by plasma virus sequencing was done before and after treatment interruption. The results of 14 patients who resumed ART for at least two months are presented. Median duration of STI was 7.5 months (range: 2-13 months). Median CD4 count was low (45/mm3) when treatment was stopped, and decreased during STI (-37/mm3 after six months). Several patients exhibited important CD4 diminutions. Viral load slightly increased (+0.83 log at M6). Few clinical events occurred: one: severe HIV-related prurigo and one CMV viremia. Reversion of resistance mutations was only seen in 2/13 (15: 4%) patients (who had previously a major CD4 deficiency, and a long treatment history), a partial reversion occurred in 5/13 (38.5%) subjects, and the mutations didn't change in the other cases (genotyping non interpretable in the last patient). ART reintroduction induced a good immune response:  CD4/mm3 after six months, with significant increases in 10/14 subjects. There was an initial viral response (median viral load: -2.34 log at M1), but a quick rebound most often occurred. However, viral load remained < 50 copies/mL in four patients. In conclusion, a rapid and important decline in CD4 cell count can occur when treatment is discontinued, in patients with virological failure of ART, but the clinical risk appears to be limited. Treatment re-initiation induces a good response, but virologically transient in most cases. Patients with a shift to wild-type virus seem to have a better response."
1600,0.005,1.0000,"(1) There is still no cure for HIV infection. The short-term treatment aims are to drive viral load below the current detection limit and to increase the CD4+ T cell count, in order to reduce morbidity and prolong survival. (2) Early initiation of treatment has both advantages and disadvantages. If the patient is symptomatic or if the CD4+ T cell count is below 200 per mm3, antiretroviral treatment should be started immediately. If the patient is asymptomatic, the CD4+ T cell count is above 350 per mm3, and viral load is below 50 000 copies/ml, antiretroviral treatment can often be deferred. Other situations should be considered case by case. (3) The benefits of treating symptomatic primary infection have not been adequately documented, and current recommendations diverge. (4) The advent of new antiretroviral drugs has increased the choice, but cross-resistance often limits treatment options. The new antiretroviral family to have emerged since 1999 is the fusion inhibitor; the only representative of this class, enfuvirtide, is reserved for patients with multiple treatment failure. (5) There is broad agreement on the principles of first-line antiretroviral treatment. It should combine at least two nucleoside (or nucleotide) inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase and one non nucleoside inhibitor, or at least one HIV protease inhibitor. Comparative studies have now identified the most effective combinations in terms of virological efficacy and tolerability. The combination should be chosen according to its established efficacy, adverse effects, risks of interactions, and convenience. There is no reference combination suitable for all patients. Among the combinations containing a non nucleoside inhibitor, those based on efavirenz are the most effective after 48 weeks of follow-up. There is less agreement on the optimal treatment of pregnant women. (6) Among the HIV protease inhibitor-based combinations, those containing nelfinavir or the lopinavir + ritonavir combination must be taken during meals. The lopinavir + ritonavir combination showed better virological efficacy than nelfinavir in a comparative trial. Experience and safety evaluation are in favour of nelfinavir, but recent American guidelines issued in November 2003 recommend the lopinavir + ritonavir combination. (7) There is no major difference in virological efficacy between non nucleoside inhibitors and protease inhibitors as first line therapy. (8) In combination with protease inhibitors or non nucleoside inhibitors, the best-assessed nucleoside inhibitors (effective for several years) are lamivudine + zidovudine and lamivudine + stavudine. For first-line treatment, combinations consisting of only three nucleoside (or nucleotide) inhibitors are less effective than combinations containing HIV protease inhibitors or non nucleoside inhibitors. (9) Efficacy is monitored on the basis of changes in viral load and the CD4+ T cell count, one month after the beginning of treatment, then about every three months. Attention must be paid to adverse effects, which may necessitate the replacement of the causative antiviral drug, treatment of the adverse effect, treatment modification or, in extreme cases, treatment withdrawal. (10) Treatment failures must be carefully investigated: the cause(s) may include poor adherence, drug interactions, and inadequate plasma drug concentrations. Ongoing antiretroviral regimens do not always have to be modified if treatment failure occurs. (11) Resistance tests can help to determine the most effective alternative in case of virological failure due to drug resistance. The choice of back-up treatments is complex, and is limited by cross-resistance. Multiple lines of treatment fail in about 3% to 4% of patients."
16820,0.005,1.0000,"Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, an acyclic nucleotide analog of adenosine monophosphate, is the most recent addition to the antiretroviral arsenal. After conversion to tenofovir by diester hydrolysis, subsequent phosphorylation by cellular enzymes to form the active tenofovir diphosphate is necessary for antiretroviral activity. Preliminary data suggest that tenofovir is as safe and efficacious as stavudine when given in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz for the treatment of antiretroviral-naïve patients. In antiretroviral-experienced patients, the addition of tenofovir to stable background antiretroviral therapy resulted in approximately a 0.6 log10 copies/ml reduction in viral load relative to placebo. Extended follow-up suggests that such virologic gains may be durable. In vitro, recombinant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) expressing the K65R mutation showed a 3-4-fold increase in the 50% inhibitory concentrations of tenofovir when compared with wild type. In vivo, this mutation thus far appears to occur infrequently and is associated with variable virologic responses. Response rates to tenofovir vary with the number and pattern of thymidine analog mutations present before starting treatment with this agent. Tenofovir appears to be a well-tolerated agent in patients who are heavily pretreated and who have advanced disease. The main adverse effects appear to be gastrointestinal in nature and include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In animals, osteomalacia and nephrotoxicity have occurred with tenofovir at exposures much higher than those observed in humans. Although no patient had to discontinue therapy as a result of elevated creatinine levels or hypophosphatemia through 58 weeks of treatment, the toxicities associated with long-term tenofovir therapy in humans are unknown. Concomitant administration of tenofovir and didanosine increases the area under the concentration-time curve of the latter by 44-60%; monitoring for signs and symptoms of didanosine toxicity is recommended. The approved dosage of tenofovir is 300 mg (one tablet) once/day with meals. Given the ease of administration and relative safety from the perspectives of adverse effects and drug interactions, tenofovir has the potential to assume a large role in the treatment of patients with HIV infection."
4262,0.005,1.0000,"All reports of hepatitis A (HA) outbreaks in healthcare settings published between 1975 and 2003 were studied to determine the background immunity or susceptibility of healthcare workers (HCWs) to HA. Twenty-six reports were found. The number of infected personnel ranged from one to 66 and, in most outbreaks, nurses accounted for the majority of personnel infected, reflecting high attack rates reaching 15-41%. In addition, we found 23 sero-epidemiological studies for HA among HCWs that had been performed in 13 different countries. Seroprevalence rates of HCWs with anti-HA antibody ranged between 4% among paramedical workers in Germany to 88% among hospital maintenance workers in Portugal. Effective infection control of HA outbreaks in hospitals demands early recognition, including awareness of atypical presentations of the infection, and strict adherence to universal infection control measures. Education programmes are of special importance for HCWs in neonatal, paediatric and intensive care units. The findings of the current study suggest that a pre-employment screening policy and administration of active vaccination to susceptible HCWs, particularly nurses, should be seriously considered in high-risk settings."
4008,0.005,1.0000,"Respiratory problems like Pneumocystic carinni and Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) are among the common opportunistic infections in patients with HIV/AIDS. The risk of acquiring Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a community becomes greater with increase in the number of HIV positive persons with active tuberculosis. This study was carried out to determine the magnitude of HIV infection among PTB patients in different parts of Nigeria as part of the year 2000 national HIV surveillance programme. Blood samples were collected on blotting paper from a total of 2826 individuals attending TB clinics between 1st of September and 1st November, 2000. Samples were collected from patients with confirmed PTB from 12 states in the 6 geopolitical/health zone (2 states/zone) of Nigeria as part of high risk sentinel population groups. Samples were tested for the presence of HIV antibodies using commercial ELISA (Genescreen HIV-1/2, Sanofi Pasteur, Paris). All initially reactive samples were retested with a rapid EIA (Gene II, Sanofi Pasteur, Paris) according to the WHO recommendations (option II). HIV Prevalence in the states varied from 4.2% in Oyo to 35.1% in Benue States with a median prevalence of 17.0%. HIV Prevalence increased with age to a peak of 23.9% among PTB patients 30-39 years and then declined progressively to 12.8% among those 60 years and above. A relatively high HIV infection rate (13.8%) was found among the young adolescent age group 10-19 years. There was no significant difference in the rate among male and female PTB patients tested. Comparison with results of previous HIV sero-surveys shows a steady increase in HIV prevalence among PTB patients over the years. The high prevalence of HIV among young PTB patients aged 10-19 years in this study is worrisome and must be noted for intervention."
5415,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is critical for reducing HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality. Food insecurity (FI) is emerging as an important barrier to adherence to care and treatment recommendations for people living with HIV (PLHIV), but this relationship has not been comprehensively examined. Therefore, we reviewed the literature to explore how FI may impact ART adherence, retention in medical care, and adherence to health care recommendations among PLHIV. We found data to support FI as a critical barrier to adherence to ART and to other health care recommendations among HIV-infected adults, HIV-infected pregnant women and their HIV-exposed infants, and child and adolescent populations of PLHIV. Associations between FI and ART non-adherence were seen in qualitative and quantitative studies. We identified a number of mechanisms to explain how food insecurity and ART non-adherence may be causally linked, including the exacerbation of hunger or ART side effects in the absence of adequate food and competing resource demands. Interventions that address FI may improve adherence to care and treatment recommendations for PLHIV. "
11900,0.005,1.0000,"The impact of demographic, psychosocial, and medical regimen-related variables on adherence of 123 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients to antiretroviral therapy was assessed by means of refill methodology. Satisfaction with social support (P = .029), problem-focused coping (P = .027), and active-behavioral coping (P = .011) correlated significantly with adherence, whereas loss of motivation (P = .006), hopelessness (P = .16), and avoidant coping (p = .015) correlated with nonadherence. At the 6-month follow-up, the mean CD4 cell count differed significantly among adherent versus nonadherent patients (a mean increase of 78/mm3 vs. a mean decrease of 5/mm3; P = .018). Adherence did not correlate with the number of antiretroviral medications consumed per day (mean, 3.0 vs. 2.5). Non-Caucasian patients were more likely to be nonadherent than Caucasian patients (relative risk, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-5.3; P = .013); this difference was not explained by age, education, employment, income, history of intravenous drug use, or medical regimen. Non-Caucasian patients, however, were less satisfied with their social support (P = .04) and informational support (P = .016) and were more likely to utilize emotion-focused coping (P = .01). Thus, satisfaction with social support and coping style significantly impacted adherence and likely accounted for the observed racial difference in adherence among HIV-infected patients."
10843,0.005,1.0000,"Vinyl-chloride monomer (VCM), a human carcinogen, has caused angiosarcoma of the liver. Recent studies have shown that VCM exposure is associated with hepatocellular cancer. In Taiwanese studies, the majority of VCM-exposed workers with liver cancer had history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. To determine the role of HBV on the development of liver cancer in the VCM-exposed workers, we conducted a case-control study from a previously established polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cohort consisting of 4096 male workers from six PVC polymerization plants. A total of 18 patients with liver cancer, and 68 control subjects matched for age and specific plant of employment were selected. Detailed history of the participants that included alcohol consumption status, cigarette use, occupation, and family history of chronic liver disease were obtained using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. When the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative subjects without history of tank-cleaning were used as the reference, the HBsAg-negative subjects with history of tank-cleaning demonstrated a 4.0-fold greater risk of liver cancer (95% confidence interval: 95% CI = 0.2-69.1). The HBsAg carriers without history of tank-cleaning revealed a 25.7-fold greater risk of liver cancer (95% CI = 2.9-229.4). Whereas the HBsAg carriers with history of tank-cleaning revealed the greatest risk (matched odds ratio (ORm) 396.0, 95% CI = 22.6 -infinity) of developing liver cancer among subjects with different VCM-exposure status and HBsAg status categories. Further analysis showed the interaction term was significant (P < .01). Therefore, our results suggest an interaction between occupational VCM exposure and HBV infection for the development of liver cancer."
2852,0.005,1.0000,"This paper analyses data on 2,226 cases of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection detected during the years 1970 to 1987. Of those where information on risk-group was available (1,301), infection among intravenous drug-abusers accounted for the largest proportion (49%). Most became infected during and since an outbreak of hepatitis B and Delta hepatitis which originated in this group in 1980. A comparison of the data before and after the start of the outbreak among drug-abusers shows a marked increase in the number of HBV infections in non drug users, including haemophiliacs, homosexuals and health-care staff, and a dramatic decrease in hepatitis B following blood transfusion. A larger group (165 cases), many of whom are long-term healthy hepatitis B surface antigen carriers, were patients in institutions for the mentally handicapped (IMH). Most were detected recently during pre-vaccination sampling programmes. Others affected included visitors to and from high-incidence areas, tattooed persons, dialysis patients, persons born to infected mothers, and members of the security forces dealing with drug-abusers. In all, 8.4% of the hepatitis B cases detected were found to be carriers and 67% of these remained carriers in 1987 The mean duration of carriage was 3.25 years. Intravenous drug-abusers and IMH patients constituted the two largest groups of carriers. The running-three-yearly mean incidence of new cases of hepatitis B has levelled off below the peak of 1981. Although the number of cases among drug-abusers has apparently decreased, the number of cases among non drug-abusing groups has increased by 50%. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5728,0.005,1.0000,"According to current estimates, there are 60,000 to 80,000 HIV and HCV coinfected individuals in Spain, and 5,000 to 10,000 HIV and HBV coinfected individuals. Among these patients, 10% to 15% have liver cirrhosis. Thus, end-stage liver disease is one of the major causes of death in our country. Liver transplantation is the only therapeutic option for these patients. Accumulated experience in North America and Europe in the last five years indicates that three-year survival in HIV-positive liver transplant recipients is similar to that of HIV-negative recipients. The selection criteria for HIV transplant candidates includes the following: no history of opportunistic infections, CD4 lymphocyte count higher than 100 cells/mm3, and HIV viral load suppressible with antiretroviral treatment. In Spain, where the majority of patients are former drug abusers, complete abstinence from heroin or cocaine use during two years is also required, with the possibility of the patient being in a methadone program. To date 26 hepatic transplants have been performed in the same number of patients, with only two deaths (7%) after a median follow-up of eight months (1-28). The main problems in the post-transplantation period in all the series has been recurrent HCV infection, which is the principle cause of post-transplantation mortality, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between the antiretroviral and immunosuppressive agents. There is little experience with pegylated interferon and ribavirin treatment in this population."
7542,0.005,1.0000,"Thalassemia major is an inherited disorder particularly common in people of Mediterranean, African, and Southeast Asian ancestry. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is responsible for 80 - 90% of post transfusion hepatitis in beta-Thalassemic patients. Marked liver iron overload, which is often inevitable in patients on regular blood transfusion, and HCV infection have been shown to have a potentiating effect on hepatic fibrogenesis in thalassemic patients. This study aimed at investigating the impact of combined chronic hepatitis C and beta-Thalassemia on innate and adaptive immune responses. The study was conducted on 60 patients and 15 apparently healthy controls. Patients were dived into three groups: group 1: 35 patients with combined beta-thalassemia and chronic hepatitis C (CHC) (betaTH/CHC), group II: 15 beta-thalassemia patients without HCV infection (betaTH), group III: 10 patients with chronic hepatitis C infection (CHC). Assessment of the number of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and NKT cells was done by flowcytometry. Human IFN-delta and IL-15 levels were estimated by Enzyme -Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). betaTH/CHC patients had significantly reduced numbers of conventional T lymphocytes, NK, NKT, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells when compared to betaTH patients. Serum IFN-gamma levels were significantly reduced in betaTH/CHC patients (2.57 pg/ml) in comparison to CHC patients (6.89pg/ml) and normal controls (4.73 pg/ml). A significant elevation of serum IL-15 levels in betaTH/CHC patients (38.04pg/ml) was found when compared to betaTH patients (16.22 pg/ml). Splenectomized patients showed reduced numbers of NK cells, NK T cells and lower CD4:CD8 ratio in comparison to non-splenectomized ones among betaTH/CHC patients. In conclusion our data show an obvious defective cellular innate immunity (NK & NKT cells) and cellular adaptive immunity (CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, & INF-gamma) in (betaTH/CHC) patients, in comparison to (betaTH) patients. This observation suggests a potentiating effect of both CHC and beta-thalassemia on depression of innate and adaptive immune status in these patients"
