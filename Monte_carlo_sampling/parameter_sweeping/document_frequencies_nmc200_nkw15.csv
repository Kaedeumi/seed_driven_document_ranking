5727,0.055,11.0000,"During recent years significant progress has been made in the treatment of HIV-1, at least in part due to the availability of potent antiretroviral drugs. The goal of the current treatment strategies is to inhibit the viral replication as completely as possible by using a combination of 3 or more antiretroviral drugs. This Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) has radically changed the clinical outcome of HIV, leading to decreased mortality and morbidity, at least in developed countries. Additionally to the advent of new and potent drugs, demonstrations of the prognostic value of the CD4 cell count and the plasma viral load were of major importance in the development of therapeutic strategies. Especially the ability of viral load assays to assess accurately the true level of viral replication, led to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. HIV proved to be a highly dynamic infection even during the period of clinical latency. The initial enthusiasm that HAART could radically change the outcome of HIV was cooled off in face of the difficulties in real life associated with the complex treatment strategies. Besides long-term side effects and suboptimal drug potency, the emergence of resistant virus and the necessity of perfect therapy adherence are major concerns for obtaining a sustained control of viral replication. In this study we focused on HIV resistance, which remains one of the major threats for a sustained response to antiretroviral therapy. HIV proved to be able to develop resistance to all currently used antiretroviral drugs. The high replication rate of the virus together with the low fidelity of the viral reverse transcriptase, from the basis for the presence of enormous amounts of viral variants. Whenever viral replication is ongoing in the presence of antiretroviral drugs, these variants that escape the inhibitory effects of the drugs will be selected. Although the knowledge in the field of HIV resistance has expanded enormously, many issues need to be answered. Genotypic and phenotypic resistance patterns are evolving continuously, due to changes in the treatment strategies. Moreover the relation between drug resistance and therapy failure needs further investigation, in order to prove the relevance of performing resistance testing in the follow-up of HIV-infected patients. The wide availability of antiretroviral drugs has led to the transmission of resistant HIV. Infection with HIV resistant to one or more antiretroviral drugs has been observed to occur through the different transmission routes. In a first study we assessed the prevalence of genotypic resistance to antiretroviral drugs in Belgian antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients. We observed that HIV strains with resistance-related mutations to one or more classes of antiretroviral drugs are not uncommon in the Belgian naïve patients. Furthermore the inclusion of samples from patients visiting the Belgian hospitals for the first time in 1995, 1997 and 1998, showed that the overall prevalence of baseline genotypic resistance remains rather constant (26-30%). The increasing trend in genotypic baseline resistance to 3TC (2% to 6.3%) and PIs (4.4% to 9.9%) as well as the decrease in ZDV-resistance (13.3% to 5.4%), reflect the change in treatment strategies, and resistance to these drugs is most probably caused by transmission of variants with resistance mutations selected during therapy. The presence of NNRTI-related mutations (around 16%) is likely to reflect the occurrence of baseline polymorphisms, since NNRTI-related mutations can occur without a replication deficit for the virus. Moreover, despite the rather recent introduction of NNRTIs into the clinic from 1997 onwards, no clear trend in NNRTI baseline resistance over time is observed. The best current therapeutic strategy for HIV-infected patients is to start antiretroviral therapy with HAART in order to avoid the accumulation of resistance towards drugs in less suppressive regimens. In a second study, we showed that the start of HAART in antiretroviral-naive HIV-patients in daily clinical practice could prevent viral breakthrough for up to 44 months in 60% of patients (n = 25). Six of 10 patients with virologic failure developed resistance to the drugs included in their treatment regimens. In comparison to patients with a sustained virologic response, patients with virologic failure were in a later disease stage when starting therapy and showed lower PI drug-levels, what can be an indication of poor adherence. Despite a poor virologic response for some of them, a rise in CD4 cell count was observed for all patients during the study period. A large number of HIV-infected patients started treatment in the pre-HAART period. The use of NRTIs is mono- or bitherapy was not able to prevent the development of resistant virus. In a third study we studied the prevalence and characteristics of 2 patterns of multinucleoside resistance (MNR) in European patients (n = 755). In patients without NRTI-exposure or with exposure to only one NRTI, no MNR was observed. MNR was present in low prevalence (each pattern < 2%) in patients pretreated with multiple NRTIs. Despite this low prevalence, MNR should be closely monitored, since it results in broad cross-resistance to NRTIs in vitro and a poor therapy response in vivo. We also assessed the predictive value of baseline resistance on the virologic response to later added drugs. The genotype of patients starting or changing a therapy consisting solely of NRTIs was analyzed at baseline and 6 months later. In patients without genotypic mutations towards the added drug the virologic response was significantly better compared to patients with baseline resistance. At 6 months however, both patient groups showed a rise in viral load due to the accumulation of NRTI-related mutations under the presence of poorly suppressive regimens, although the difference between the two groups remained significant. In this study, and also in studies reported by others, the presence of baseline resistance has a high predictive value for therapy failure, while the absence of resistance is not predictive for therapy response. Suboptimal adherence may be one of the reasons of the poor predictive value of the absence of baseline resistance for a good therapy response. In a last observational study, we investigated the relation between adherence, the presence and development of genotypic resistance and the virologic response in patients during HAART therapy. Adherence to 1 protease inhibitor was monitored using Electronic Event Monitoring. Patients with perfect therapy adherence and in particular without drug holidays, can control viral replication provided that the activity of the drugs included in the combination is not entirely compromised by the presence of baseline resistance mutations. In our patient population, reduced adherence resulted in therapy failure, mostly associated with a subsequent accumulation of resistance mutations. In conclusion, the outcome of the HIV disease has been revolutionarily changed with the advent of HAART. Both resistance and treatment adherence are crucial factors in determining the therapy response. Retrospective studies, such as ours, and a limited number of prospective trials already proved the short-term benefit of therapy switch based on the results of resistance tests in addition to standard of care. To ultimately define the role of tools as resistance testing and adherence monitoring with eventual adherence interventions, more prospective trials are needed as well in treatment-naïve as in experienced patients."
14248,0.045,9.0000,"Although weight loss associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is multifactorial in its pathogenesis, it has been speculated that hypogonadism, a common occurrence in HIV disease, contributes to depletion of lean tissue and muscle dysfunction. We, therefore, examined the effects of testosterone replacement by means of Androderm, a permeation-enhanced, nongenital transdermal system, on lean body mass, body weight, muscle strength, health-related quality of life, and HIV-disease markers. We randomly assigned 41 HIV-infected, ambulatory men, 18-60 yr of age, with serum testosterone levels below 400 ng/dL, to 1 of 2 treatment groups: group I, two placebo patches (n = 21); or group II, two testosterone patches designed to release 5 mg testosterone over 24 h. Eighteen men in the placebo group and 14 men in the testosterone group completed the 12-week treatment. Serum total and free testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels increased, and LH and FSH levels decreased in the testosterone-treated, but not in the placebo-treated, men. Lean body mass and fat-free mass, measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, increased significantly in men receiving testosterone patches [change in lean body mass, +1.345 +/- 0.533 kg (P = 0.02 compared to no change); change in fat-free mass, +1.364 +/- 0.525 kg (P = 0.02 compared to no change)], but did not change in the placebo group [change in lean body mass, 0.189 +/- 0.470 kg (P = NS compared to no change); change in fat-free mass, 0.186 +/- 0.470 kg (P = NS compared to no change)]. However, there was no significant difference between the 2 treatment groups in the change in lean body mass. The change in lean body mass during treatment was moderately correlated with the increment in serum testosterone levels (r = 0.41; P = 0.02). The testosterone-treated men experienced a greater decrease in fat mass than those receiving placebo patches (P = 0.04). There was no significant change in body weight in either treatment group. Changes in overall quality of life scores did not correlate with testosterone treatment; however, in the subcategory of role limitation due to emotional problems, the men in the testosterone group improved an average of 43 points of a 0-100 possible score, whereas those in the placebo group did not change. Red cell count increased in the testosterone group (change in red cell count, +0.1 +/- 0.1 10(12)/L) but decreased in the placebo group (change in red cell count, -0.2 +/- 0.1 10(12)/L). CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts and plasma HIV copy number did not significantly change during treatment. Serum prostate-specific antigen and plasma lipid levels did not change in either treatment group. Testosterone replacement in HIV-infected men with low testosterone levels is safe and is associated with a 1.35-kg gain in lean body mass, a significantly greater reduction in fat mass than that achieved with placebo treatment, an increased red cell count, and an improvement in role limitation due to emotional problems. Further studies are needed to assess whether testosterone supplementation can produce clinically meaningful changes in muscle function and disease outcome in HIV-infected men."
10635,0.04,8.0000,"The work on this thesis began in 2003 when the global HIV epidemic was out of control. A minority of persons with HIV were benefitting fully from the recently introduced highly efficacious antiretroviral therapy (ART) combinations. Among the global challenges were lack of access to good healthcare, drug toxicity, and emergence of drug-resistant virus. It was unknown how long the drugs could maintain their efficacy in the individual even if administered as intended, and there was a fear that the increased drug pressure would increase the prevalence of drug resistance, subsequently leading to transmission of resistant virus from one individual to another, and thereby waning the treatment options available. Hence, we were far from the ideal conditions where an HIV-infected individual gets to know immediately that he/she is infected, has access to specialized medical and social support, receives a drug combination which effectively suppresses the virus and has no side effects, and is free of co-morbid conditions both before and after he/she gets infected. The nine papers on which this thesis is based each aimed to provide new knowledge to aspects of the above. Late diagnosis and late presentation to clinical care continue to be major barriers to improved HIV management. We used nation-wide hospital registries to explore the potential for an indicator disease-based HIV testing strategy. A range of conditions that were manifestations of the HIV infection itself were found to be associated with highly increased risk of HIV diagnosis during the coming year, but less so three to five years later. Other conditions were associated with an almost constant five-year long increased risk of being diagnosed with HIV because they share behavioural risk factors with HIV, making them indicators of not only current HIV but also of future HIV acquisition. Hence, indicator condition-based testing should be adapted to the local epidemic and could be a valuable addition to the existing detection practice. Once diagnosed, getting the full benefit of modern HIV care requires access to a good healthcare system. We compared temporal trends in quality and quantity of ART introduction in Den-mark and Greenland. Despite similar levels of health worker education and economic resources, ART implementation and mortality decline in Greenland lacked several years behind Denmark. The study reminded us that although economy may be a prerequisite for implementing an effective HIV care system, it is certainly not all it takes. The nationwide nature of the Danish HIV Cohort Study also allowed us to study a number of time trends at the population level. Despite what was feared, we found that the prevalence of triple-drug class virological failure (TCF) seemed to have stabilized after 2000; that the incidence rates of drug resistance acquisition were decreasing during 1999-2005; and that the prevalence of potential transmitters of drug-resistant HIV decreased during 1997-2004. We also looked at some of the consequences of virological failure and drug resistance and found that even modest levels of viraemia were associated with a high risk of future failure and death, and that in persons who have experienced TCF, the number and pattern of resistance mutations were independent predictors of death. Hence, despite the overall positive trends in virological failure and drug-resistance development at the population level, our findings underline the crucial importance of always having an effective treatment option available for the individual patient with drug-resistant virus. As mortality was declining for persons with access to ART and good HIV care, it became important to know how long persons with HIV could expect to live compared to the general population. We projected long-term survival and found that a 25-year old person with HIV and without hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection had a 50 per cent chance of surviving another 39 years, only 12.2 years less than a person in a matched general population cohort would survive. With improved survival and declining HIV-related co-morbidity, non-HIV related co-morbidity became a more visible contributor to the health status of persons with HIV. We assessed the impact of non-HIV related comorbidity acquired before the person became infected with HIV. We found that 32% of the observed mortality in our cohort was due to HCV and co-morbidities measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index, 13% corresponded to the background mortality in the population, and that only 55% of the mortality could be attributed to HIV. Our findings confirmed that persons acquiring HIV differ at large from the general population, and that we should not expect overall mortality rates in populations with HIV to reach the levels in the general population. This thesis attempted to map some of the many challenges on the road towards increased survival of individuals and populations with HIV up to a level, which today in many settings is close to that of the general population. The studies in this thesis have each paid their modest contribution to show how crucially important it is to be diagnosed in time, to have access to a well-functioning health system, and to keep free of co-morbidity both before and after acquiring HIV. After many years of struggle and despair, and thanks to enormous advances in prevention and treatment, we are now looking towards a promising future. "
17760,0.025,5.0000,"Hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection is a major health burden in the Asia-Pacific region. The seriousness of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is often realized at a late stage. The resultant morbidity and mortality from cirrhosis complications is considerable, with a high human cost. The most affected patients are men aged 40 years or older. Two decades ago, the prognosis for the 300 million ""Australia antigen""-positive people (people with chronic HBV infection) was gloomy, with no effective intervention. Twenty years on, research and development have changed their outlook. Chronic hepatitis should now be diagnosed early, at the asymptomatic stage. Proper assessment and judicial introduction of therapy can suppress replication of HBV and resolve liver inflammation, thereby preventing the silent progression of chronic liver disease to end-stage cirrhosis. Interferon (IFN) monotherapy has been available for nearly 20 years, but various limitations restrict its general application. Injection-based therapies are inconvenient, the response rate is low (33% hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion rate among optimal cases), side-effects are many, and some serious, and the cost is unaffordable for most people. However, in non-cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate disease activity, IFN is still a worthwhile option because the treatment course is shorter, mutation seems less of a problem and most responses are permanent and reduce or abolish late complications. Lamivudine, an oral nucleoside analog with potent antiviral effects, has been approved in many countries. Daily dosing of 100 mg reduces serum HBV-DNA to below detectable levels within 6 weeks. In HBeAg-positive patients, approximately 16% of treated patients seroconverted with the first year. This was associated with significant improvement in liver histology. Long-term treatment induces further HBeAg seroconversion, but overall clinical benefit is undermined by continuous emergence of drug-resistant YMDD mutants. In an Asian multicentre study, 58 patients on 5 years lamivudine therapy showed annual cumulative HBeAg seroconversion rates at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years of 22, 29, 40, 47 and 50%, respectively. The best predictor of response is pretreatment alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Among patients with ALT > 2x the upper limit of normal (ULN), annual HBeAg seroconversion is increased to 38, 42, 65, 73 and 77%, respectively. However, emergence of YMDD mutants occurred at a cumulative rate of 15, 38, 55, 67 and 69%, respectively. The impact of this emergence on disease activity is unpredictable. Thus, while continued disease suppression, or even HBeAg seroconversion, still occurred in some patients, in others hepatitis may relapse and liver failure has been reported despite continuation of lamivudine. While the duration of lamivudine therapy is difficult to define, the best strategy may be to define only active CHB with major ALT elevation (par-ticularly ALT > 5x ULN) for a duration of 1 year or less. Lamivudine can be stopped in responders. The response is durable in approximately 80% of responders. Non-responders should be monitored closely for rebound off treatment. Therapy can be re-instituted if ALT is over 5x ULN. Management of patients with YMDD mutants can be challenging, but there is no clear evidence to recommend stopping or continuing lamivudine, or to add other possible effective agents, such as adefovir dipivoxil. More data are required to help draw up guidelines. Hepatitis B e antigen-negative CHB has been less well studied. Both IFN and lamivudine can suppress disease activity, but permanent responses are few. Without a distinct marker as an end-point for response, the duration of treatment is even more difficult to define. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction for low viral levels may give a clue, but definitive studies are required. Monotherapy is clearly not the answer for the majority of CHB patients with active disease. Combination therapy has the theoretical advantage of additional or synergistic efficacy. Preliminary results on IFN and lamivudine are promising and further clinical trials are ongoing. Emtricitabine (FTC), adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, BL-thymidine (L-dT), DAPD, clevudine (l-FMAU), thymosin, therapeutic vaccines and various herbal medicines are potential candidates. Antiviral action in conjunction with immune modulation may have a better chance of eradicating HBV and its cccDNA in the hepatocytes as the basis for an eventual successful outcome. The key points are: (i) approved therapeutic agents for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are IFN, lamivudine and thymosin (in a few countries only); (ii) indications for IFN therapy are viremia in compensated CHB patients with moderately raised ALT; (iii) lamivudine has broader therapeutic indications: it is effective in subgroups of CHB patients with compensated or decompensated liver diseases, but generally works better if patients have raised ALT; (iv) lamivudine has a potent suppressive action on HBV replication, including HBeAg-negative variants, but cannot eliminate cccDNA; this is the reason for the relapse of disease after discontinuing treatment, unless HBeAg seroconversion is obtained; (v) successful use of lamivudine aims at HBeAg seroconversion or profound suppression of HBV-DNA to serum levels of less than 100 000 viral copies/mL, in order to prevent emergence of drug-resistant YMDD mutants (which commences from 6 months onward); (vi) YMDD mutants may cause a flare of hepatitis, resulting in deterioration of liver histology and, occasionally, liver failure; (vii) combination therapy of lamivudine with IFN (standard or pegylated) or other nucleoside analogs should be the next advance. Preliminary data from IFN and lamivudine combination therapy show some promise, but there are conflicting results."
17043,0.02,4.0000,"We examined the impact of antiretroviral treatment adherence among hepatitis C (HCV) coinfected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients on survival and clinical outcomes. We analyzed Medicaid claims data from 14 southern states from 2005 to 2007, comparing survival and clinical outcomes and cost of treatment for HIV and HCV coinfected patients (N = 4115) at different levels of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). More than one in five patients (20.5%) showed less than 50% adherence to antiretroviral treatment, but there were no racial/ethnic or gender disparities. Significant survival benefit was demonstrated at each incremental level of adherence to ART (one-year mortality ranging from 3.5% in the highest adherence group to 26.0% in the lowest). Low-adherence patients also had higher rates of hospitalization and emergency department visits. Relative to patients with high (>95%) ART adherence, those with less than 25% treatment adherence had fourfold greater risk of death (adjusted odds ratio 4.22 [95% CI: 3.03, 5.87]). Nondrug Medicaid expenditures were lower for high-adherence patients, but cost of medications drove total Medicaid expenditures higher for high-adherence patients. Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved (relative to the <25% low-adherence group) ranged from $21,874 for increasing adherence to 25-50% to $37,229 for increasing adherence to 75-95%. Adherence to ART for patients with HIV and HCV coinfection is associated with lower adverse clinical outcomes at a Medicaid cost per QALY commensurate with other well-accepted treatment and prevention strategies. Further research is needed to identify interventions which can best achieve optimal ART adherence at a population scale."
6488,0.02,4.0000,"In Japan, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection of some patients with hemophilia was caused by the transfusion of imported blood products, such as unheated coagulation factor. With the development of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV, chronic HCV infection has become a major cause of liver disease and mortality for hemophiliac patients coinfected with HCV/HIV. Data is limited regarding the efficacy and safety of antiviral therapy with the HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir (TVR) in combination with pegylated interferon-α (PegIFN-α) and ribavirin (RBV) for hemophilia patients coinfected with HCV/HIV. We report a case of a Japanese patient with hemophilia and HCV/HIV coinfection who had partial response to prior to PegIFN-α and RBV therapy. This is the first published report of 24-week TVR-based triple therapy for a hemophilia patient coinfected with HCV/HIV. The patient had HCV genotype 1a infection with a high viral load. His single-nucleotide polymorphism of the interleukin 28B (rs8099917) gene was the TT major allele. He presented with undetectable HIV RNA and a high CD4(+) T cell counts by taking ART including tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir. He was again treated for HCV with TVR plus PegIFN-α2b and RBV for the first 12 weeks, followed by the continuation of PegIFN-α2b and RBV for 12 additional weeks while continuing ART. He had rapid virological response and achieved sustained virological response with the 24-week treatment. No serious adverse events such as skin rash, severe anemia or exacerbated bleeding tendency were observed, only a mild headache. No dose adjustment was necessary when tenofovir and raltegravir were used in combined with TVR, and no HIV breakthrough was observed. TVR-based triple therapy with ART could can an effective treatment for hemophilia patients coinfected with HCV (genotype 1)/HIV regardless of prior response. TVR can be used in combination with tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir for patients with hemophilia. Furthermore, patients with undetectable HCV RNA at week 4 could be successfully treated with a 24-week regimen. "
640,0.02,4.0000,"Although China's government is rapidly expanding access to antiretroviral therapy, little is known about barriers to adherence among Chinese HIV-infected patients, particularly among injection drug users. To better understand barriers to antiretroviral treatment adherence, we conducted a qualitative research study, using both focus group and key informant methods, among 36 HIV-positive men and women in Dali, in southwestern China. All interviews utilized semi-structured question guides and were conducted in Mandarin, audio-recorded and translated into English for analysis. The most commonly cited adherence challenges were stigma, including secondary stigma experienced by family members; mental health issues; and economic concerns, particularly related to finding and maintaining employment. Distinctive gender differences emerged, partly due to previous heroin use among male respondents. Optimizing adherence may require that antiretroviral therapy programs be linked to other services, including drug addiction treatment, mental health services and vocational treatment and support. HIV care and service providers and policy makers in China responsible for HIV treatment should be aware of these important barriers to adherence."
7112,0.02,4.0000,"Although a considerable number of studies have been undertaken to date, it is still controversial as to whether or not coinfection with schistosomiasis increases the susceptibility to or progression from Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This review is a closer examination of the key studies conducted on human populations on clinical factors that were published in English between 1975 and January 2015. Our review is mainly based on tables containing the salient information, which are arranged first by study population, country of study and publication date. We provide further explanation, clarification and discussion in the text. As such, it includes both studies that have been conducted on general populations who are largely asymptomatic for clinical disease (Table 3), as well as those focussing on special populations, which are usually comprised of clinical patients. These special populations have been presented as follows: subjects with chronic liver disease or related conditions such as cirrhosis, Table 4; subjects with primary liver cancer, Table 5; subjects with schistosomiasis, Table 6; subjects with acute or chronic hepatitis resulting from HBV, Table 7 and, subjects with HCV, Table 8. We have presented studies that compared two mono-infected groups with one that is coinfected separately in Table 9, as these offer us the best basis from which to evaluate if any synergistic effects accompany coinfection. A number of factors contributed to the results reported in our tables. These included, but are not limited to: subject selection (i.e. asymptomatic cases typically drawn from the general population vs subjects presenting to a hospital or clinic with clinical disease); study design, which directly impacts our ability to infer causality (i.e. case series, cross-sectional, case-control, cohort study); use and choice of control population (i.e. apparently healthy subjects vs other hospital patients vs none); sample size, which directly impacts statistical power and can result in a Type II error; geographic area, which may reflect differences in population genetics, public health history, environmental differences or any number of other important factors (i.e. Egypt, Brazil, China); method of testing for schistosomal infections (i.e. stool vs antibody test); method of testing to determine if advanced schistosomal disease was present (i.e. ultrasound, liver biopsy vs none); method of serological testing for HBV (i.e. use of HBsAg alone or with other markers or DNA testing); method of serological testing for HCV (i.e. use of anti-HCV alone or with RNA testing) and, year of the study, which reflects among other things, technological improvements between tests as well as possible changes in the frequency of exposure in the populations under study (i.e. use of parenteral antischistosomal therapy vs the oral antischistosomal medication). Despite all these differences, throughout this review we have observed general patterns that seem largely consistent with one another. Studies conducted on general, largely asymptomatic populations tend to support the view that having one of the diseases in question (i.e. schistosomiasis) does not necessarily predispose one to becoming coinfected with another (i.e. HBV or HCV). Rather, the probability of becoming coinfected seems most closely associated with modes of transmission for either HBV or HCV in schistosome-endemic areas, such as the past use of parenteral antischistosomal therapy or frequent blood transfusion. Once coinfected, however, the clinical course of illness for those with Schistosoma-HBV or Schistosoma-HCV infections are typically much more severe than for mono-infected subjects. The strongest evidence for this was found in the half-dozen or so prospective cohort studies that systematically monitored disease progression in their subjects. With respect to HBV infection, coinfection with Schistosoma prolonged the carriage state and more often resulted in chronic hepatitis with greater cirrhosis as well as higher mortality. Much of the same was also observed with respect to HCV, where coinfection with Schistosoma was associated with a reduced ability to spontaneously resolve the viral infection and more often resulted in rapid fibrosis as well as higher mortality. Furthermore, two of these studies which were fully comparative in nature, support the supposition that there is a synergistic association between Schistosoma-HCV for both liver fibrosis and mortality. Immunological studies, all conducted on HCV, also generally seem to support this. The results of our research argue for greater primary prevention for both HBV and HCV in Schistosoma-endemic populations. Although no vaccine currently exists for HCV as it does for HBV, additional steps can still be taken to reduce transmission in high-risk populations. Greater use of the HBV vaccine is particularly advisable. Finally, additional observational, longitudinal studies conducted on human populations that are fully comparative in nature could help answer some of the remaining questions on both Schistosoma-HBV as well as Schistosoma-HCV coinfections. Some of these include the role of active versus past schistosomal infections, the role of genetic variants, as well as the effect of coinfection on treatment. Future studies should make a particular effort to use a sufficient sample size to ensure adequate statistical power, which was not often properly considered in many of the studies we reviewed for this paper.

12383,0.02,4.0000,"Weight loss is reported by more than 20% of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-monoinfected patients treated with the peg-interferon (peg-IFN) and ribavirin combination. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors of severe weight loss (> or =10%) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) / HCV-coinfected patients participating in a randomized, controlled 48-week trial comparing peg-IFN alpha 2b plus ribavirin with IFN alpha-2b plus ribavirin. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify links with antiretroviral treatments, anti-HCV therapy and clinical and laboratory findings. One hundred eleven (28.9%) of 383 patients who received at least one dose of anti-HCV treatment subsequently had severe weight loss. Among patients who took at least 80% of the planned total dose, severe weight loss occurred in 74 patients (32.7%). In multivariate analysis, age >40 years [hazard ratio (HR), 1.59; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.31; P = 0.016], body mass index (BMI) >22 (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.16 to 2.55; P = 0.0069), peg-IFN alpha-2b (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.69; P = 0.0022) and female sex (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.43; P = 0.027) were associated with severe weight loss. In contrast, patients taking non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)-containing antiretroviral regimens were less likely to lose weight (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.96; P = 0.034). Lipodystrophy tended to occur more frequently in patients who had severe weight loss than in the other patients (26.1%vs 17.6%; P = 0.0682) and patients whose weight loss >5% persisted 24 weeks after the completion of anti-HCV therapy (n = 58 / 111) were more likely to be receiving stavudine-based antiretroviral therapy, suggesting that mitochondrial toxicity plays some role in weight loss. These findings show that severe weight loss is a frequent side effect of anti-HCV therapy in HIV / HCV-coinfected patients. The underlying mechanisms remain to be identified."
2148,0.02,4.0000,"In this multicenter study, we investigated the prognostic factors that influence the risk of death in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Clinical and laboratory indices obtained from 161 HIV-seropositive patients who underwent a detailed morphologic and immunophenotypic evaluation of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood cell populations were retrospectively analyzed. In 155 patients, death occurred within the 48-mo follow-up (mean follow-up: 14.8 mo; range: 1 to 48 mo). In the univariate analysis, the patient's age (> 30 yr), HIV disease status, HIV transmission category, number of opportunistic pathogens isolated from the BAL, percentage of BAL neutrophils, and low number of BAL CD4 T cells were predictive of increased mortality. In contrast, the presence of an alveolitis or an increase in the numbers of alveolar macrophages and CD3 T cells was associated with a decreased mortality. In the multivariate analysis, significant independent predictors were age, risk factor for HIV, and presence of an alveolitis. Furthermore, patients with a low number of BAL CD4 T cells had a particularly poor prognosis while the CD4 T-cell count in the peripheral blood (< 50 cells/mm3 in the majority of our patients) had a negligible effect on predicting survival. Our findings suggest the clinical utility of BAL analysis in patients infected with HIV."
16699,0.015,3.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive cases have been reported among people who injected drugs in Liangshan Prefecture in southwest of China since 1995 and Liangshan has become one of the most seriously affected epidemic areas in China. In 2004, several patients with HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) initiated antiretroviral treatment (ART) at the Central Hospital of Liangshan Prefecture. From 2005 to 2013, the number of patients receiving ART dramatically increased.We conducted a retrospective cohort study to analyze the long-term survival time and associated factors among patients with HIV/AIDS who received ART in Liangshan Prefecture for the first time. Data were collected from the Chinese AIDS Antiretroviral Therapy DATAFax Information System. A life table and the Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportion hazard regression were used to calculate the survival time and its associated factors, respectively.Among 8310 ART-naïve patients with HIV/AIDS who initiated ART, 436 patients died of AIDS-related diseases, and their median time of receiving ART was 15.0 ± 12.3 months, whereas 28.7% of them died within the first 6 months after treatment. The cumulative survival rates of those receiving ART in 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years were 97.1%, 93.4%, 90.6%, 88.8%, and 86.0%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that male patients on ART were at a higher risk of death from AIDS-related diseases (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-2.1) than female patients. Patients infected with HIV through injection drug use (IDU) were at a higher risk of death (AHR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.2) than those infected through heterosexual transmission. Patients with a baseline CD4 cell count <50/mm (AHR = 9.8, 95% CI: 6.0-15.9), 50-199/mm (AHR = 3.3, 95% CI: 2.3-4.6), and 200-349/mm (AHR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2-2.3) were at a higher risk of death than those with a CD4 cell count ≥350/mm.ART prolonged survival time of patients with HIV/AIDS and improved their survival probability. Patients with HIV/AIDS should be consistently followed up and the CD4 T-cell count regularly monitored, and timely and early antiretroviral therapy initiated in order to achieve a better survival rate.

18089,0.015,3.0000,"The rate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression or death of individuals coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is conflicting. The complete-case analysis systematically used, excludes patients unscreened for HCV. Our objective was to assess if rate of survival differed between HIV-infected patients screened and unscreened for HCV in a hospital-based prospective cohort study. Patients were enrolled in the Lyon section of the French Hospital Database on HIV between 1 July 1992 and 31 May 2005. A multivariate Cox regression model was used to analyse the association of HCV screening with survival. Of 3244 patients, 299 (9.2%) were not screened for HCV. The populations screened and unscreened differed by the proportion of acquired immune deficiency syndrome at baseline, presumed route of infection, CD4 cell count category at baseline, mean duration of follow-up, mean number of visits per year, type of antiretroviral therapy and survival. The rate of progression to death was higher for non-HCV-screened vs HCV-screened patients: the incidence rate among HCV-screened patients was 22.9/1000 patient-years; the incidence rate among HCV-unscreened patients was 52.4/1000 patient-years. The adjusted hazards ratio of death was 2.48 [95% confidence interval (1.83-3.35); P < 0.001] for patients with unknown HCV status compared with others. In conclusion, unscreened or unknown HCV status was associated with an increased risk of death in our hospital cohort. Important prognostic factors are related to, or confounded by the practice of HCV screening."
14100,0.015,3.0000,"Non-adherence to safer sex and non-adherence to ART can each have adverse health consequences for HIV-infected individuals and their sex partners, but little is known about the association of these behaviors with each other. This ""dual risk"" has potential negative public health consequences since non-adherence can lead to the development of resistant virus that can then be transmitted to sex partners. Among participants in the Multi-site Adherence Collaboration in HIV we examined, at study baseline, the association between the frequency of unprotected sex (assessed by self-report) and ART adherence (assessed by Medication Event Monitoring System, Aardex) among the sexually active participants in the five studies (N = 459) that collected sexual risk behavior. The bivariate association between sexual risk behaviors and ART adherence was assessed by Pearson correlations; subsequently regression analyses were used to evaluate the role of demographic characteristics, depression and substance use in explaining the ""dual risk"" outcome (sexual risk and non-adherence). Among participants who had been sexually active, more unprotected anal/vaginal sex was weakly associated with poorer ART adherence (r = -0.12, p = 0.01 for the overall sample). Further analysis showed this association was driven by the heterosexual men in the sample (r = -0.29, p < 0.001), and was significant only for this group, and not for gay/bisexual men or for women (heterosexual and homosexual). Neither substance use nor depression accounted for the association between sexual risk and ART adherence. HIV-infected heterosexual men who are having difficulty adhering to ART are also more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors and therefore may benefit from counseling about these risk behaviors. We must identify procedures to screen for these risk behaviors and develop interventions, appropriately tailored to specific populations and identified risk factors, that can be integrated into routine clinical care for people living with HIV. This will become increasingly important in the context of wider access to treatment globally, including new recommendations for ART initiation earlier in a patients' disease course (e.g., ""Test and Treat"" paradigms)."
2950,0.015,3.0000,"Boceprevir (Victrelis®) is an inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural protein NS3-4A serine protease and is used in combination with pegylated interferon (peginterferon)-alpha and ribavirin in the treatment of adults with chronic HCV (chronic hepatitis C) genotype 1 infection. Of the various genotypes of HCV, genotype 1 is one of the least responsive to interferon and ribavirin-based therapy, and thus most in need of novel treatments. This article reviews the available pharmacological properties of boceprevir and its clinical efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection in adult patients who are either treatment-naive or have failed previous standard therapy. Boceprevir, when co-administered with peginterferon-alpha and ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection who were treatment-naive or had previously not fully responded to or had relapsed following treatment, was associated with a significantly higher sustained virological response rate (defined as the proportion of patients with an undetectable plasma HCV RNA level at week 24 of the follow-up period [week 72 overall]) [primary endpoint] than peginterferon-alpha-2b and ribavirin alone, regardless of the boceprevir administration regimen, in the phase III SPRINT-2 (treatment-naive patients) and RESPOND-2 (previously treated patients) trials. There was no significant difference between full-duration (44 weeks) and response-guided (24 or 32 weeks followed by follow-up or peginterferon-alpha-2b plus ribavirin alone) boceprevir regimen recipients with regard to sustained virological response rate. All patients received an initial 4-week lead-in treatment period before the comparative treatment period began. Overall, boceprevir is generally well tolerated when administered concomitantly with peginterferon-alpha plus ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection. The most common adverse events in any treatment group were flu-like symptoms, which are typically reported in patients receiving peginterferon-ribavirin therapy. The addition of boceprevir to peginterferon-alpha and ribavirin is associated with an increased risk of anaemia and neutropenia. In conclusion, boceprevir in combination with peginterferon-alpha and ribavirin is an effective and generally well tolerated treatment for treatment-naive or previously treated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection. The drug is associated with higher sustained virological response rates in these patients, in whom treatment with interferon and ribavirin alone may not be successful. Thus, boceprevir in combination with peginterferon-alpha and ribavirin is a valuable new treatment option for use in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection."
9124,0.015,3.0000,"Since 1984 reports of renal involvement in AIDS patients have been presented in the literature. Different forms of renal disease were noted in the AIDS population including those related to systemic and local renal infections, tubulointerstitial disease, renal involvement by neoplasm and glomerular disease including collapsing glomerulopathy (CG). HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) has been demonstrated to be more severe in the black population. HIVAN is the most common cause of renal failure in HIV-1-seropositive patients. The term HIVAN is reserved for the typical histopathological form of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) characterized by the findings of coexistent glomerular and severe tubulointerstitial disease. In both humans and the murine model, glomerular lesions include FSGS, glomerular collapse and podocyte hyperplasia. The tubulointerstitial damage as well as the glomerular collapse can also be seen in non-HIV primary collapsing GN, raising the question of common mechanisms to HIV and other non-identified viral agents related to the development of the disease. Although controversial, increasing evidence supports a direct effect of the virus on renal cells either as a result of exposure to viral proteins or direct renal parenchyma infection. The use of a HIV-1 transgenic mouse model has demonstrated a direct etiologic link between HIV-1 expression in kidney and the development of HIVAN with unique viral-host interactions, which depend at the same time on stimulating features of the virus and the individual nature of the host response. The infection of renal cells by HIV-1 could be detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of gag RNA at a low level. Some studies using an HIV-1 transgenic mouse model have demonstrated that expression of HIV- 1 in the kidney is required for the development of HIVAN. The final common pathway in the development of HIV-associated nephropathy is likely to involve alterations in the patterns of gene expression of renal parenchyma cells by cytokines and growth factors, leading to interstitial fibrosis and enhanced glomerular matrix synthesis. The nature of the host response to viral infection is critical to the development of nephropathy.HLA-linked responses particular to a subset of blacks may explain some of the epidemiologic features of HIVAN. There may also be biological heterogeneity in the strains of HIV-1 that could account for a particular renotropic strain. HIV strains from different parts of the world may vary by as much as 15% at the level of nucleotide sequence. The infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in human glomerular cells has been evaluated by exposing homogeneous cultures of human glomerular capillary endothelial, mesangial and epithelial cells to HIV in vitro. The mechanism of access of HIV into glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells is unknown up to now; HIV is generally infectious for cells expressing the CD4 antigen in their cell membrane. Other modes of HIV entry into cells independent of the CD4 receptor are possible through mechanisms involving Fc-receptors or coinfection with other enveloped viruses such as HTLV-l. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of HIVAN has been aided by the development of a transgenic model. The curious fact that only 3 of 8 founded transgenic lines developed nephropathy emphasizes that the expression of viral gene products per se is not sufficient to produce nephropathy. Human renal epithelium does not express CD4 receptors and in vitro attempts to infect glomerular epithelial cells using laboratory strains of HIV-1 have proven fruitless. The striking morphologic and phenotypic similarities between HIVAN and collapsing idiopathic FSGS raise the question whether the altered podocyte gene expression in collapsing idiopathic FSGS may also be due to a viral infection. This hypothesis is further supported by de novo occurrence of collapsing idiopathic FSGS in immunosuppressed renal transplantation patients and by epidemiologic data. In conclusion, there are likely to be common mechanisms in the pathogenesis for collapsing idiopathic glomerulosclerosis and HIVAN. A primary injury of the podocyte leading to dysregulation of the cellular phenotype appears to mediate the glomerular tuft collapse in both conditions. Primary collapsing glomerulopathy recurs post-transplantation, raising the possibility of circulating factors implicated in the pathogenesis of visceral epithelial cell damage in steroid-resistant minimal change disease or recurrent FSGS. Recurrence of CG can occur hours after transplantation, suggesting that the plasma of CG patients contains one or more factors capable of inducing proteinuria due to the damage of the podocyte that results in the increase in glomerular permeability. In a rat model of CG developed by our group, the injection of serum from CG patients resulted in proteinuria, glomerular tuft retraction and podocyte damage at the ultrastructural level (visceral epithelial cell foot-process effacement). No ultrastructural or light microscopy abnormalities were seen in rats injected with serum from non-collapsing FSGS or healthy subjects. Based on the experience of our group, circulating factors play a dominant role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic CG."
734,0.015,3.0000,"The availability of an increasing number of antiretroviral agents and the rapid evolution of new information has introduced substantial complexity into treatment regimens for persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation convened the Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV to develop guidelines for clinical management of HIV-infected adults and adolescents (CDC. Report of the NIH Panel To Define Principles of Therapy of HIV Infection and Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected adults and adolescents. MMWR 1998;47[RR-5]:1-41). This report, which updates the 1998 guidelines, addresses 1) using testing for plasma HIV ribonucleic acid levels (i.e., viral load) and CD4+ T cell count; 2) using testing for antiretroviral drug resistance; 3) considerations for when to initiate therapy; 4) adherence to antiretroviral therapy; 5) considerations for therapy among patients with advanced disease; 6) therapy-related adverse events; 7) interruption of therapy; 8) considerations for changing therapy and available therapeutic options; 9) treatment for acute HIV infection; 10) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among adolescents; 11) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among pregnant women; and 12) concerns related to transmission of HIV to others. Antiretroviral regimens are complex, have serious side effects, pose difficulty with adherence, and carry serious potential consequences from the development of viral resistance because of nonadherence to the drug regimen or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents. Patient education and involvement in therapeutic decisions is critical. Treatment should usually be offered to all patients with symptoms ascribed to HIV infection. Recommendations for offering antiretroviral therapy among asymptomatic patients require analysis of real and potential risks and benefits. Treatment should be offered to persons who have <350 CD4+ T cells/mm3 or plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels of >55,000 copies/mL (by b-deoxyribonucleic acid [bDNA] or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] assays). The recommendation to treat asymptomatic patients should be based on the willingness and readiness of the person to begin therapy; the degree of existing immunodeficiency as determined by the CD4+ T cell count; the risk for disease progression as determined by the CD4+ T cell count and level of plasma HIV RNA; the potential benefits and risks of initiating therapy in an asymptomatic person; and the likelihood, after counseling and education, of adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. Treatment goals should be maximal and durable suppression of viral load, restoration and preservation of immunologic function, improvement of quality of life, and reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Results of therapy are evaluated through plasma HIV RNA levels, which are expected to indicate a 1.0 log10 decrease at 2-8 weeks and no detectable virus (<50 copies/mL) at 4-6 months after treatment initiation. Failure of therapy at 4-6 months might be ascribed to nonadherence, inadequate potency of drugs or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents, viral resistance, and other factors that are poorly understood. Patients whose therapy fails in spite of a high level of adherence to the regimen should have their regimen changed; this change should be guided by a thorough drug treatment history and the results of drug-resistance testing. Because of limitations in the available alternative antiretroviral regimens that have documented efficacy, optimal changes in therapy might be difficult to achieve for patients in whom the preferred regimen has failed. These decisions are further confounded by problems with adherence, toxicity, and resistance. For certain patients, participating in a clinical trial with or without access to new drugs or using a regimen that might not achieve complete suppression of viral replication might be preferable. Because concepts regarding HIV management are evolving rapidly, readers should check regularly for additional information and updates at the HIV/AIDS Treatment Information Service website (http://www.hivatis.org)."
9053,0.015,3.0000,"Hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV coinfection is common and liver disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among coinfected patients. Despite advances in HCV treatment, few HIV coinfected patients actually initiate treatment. We examined patient and provider characteristics associated with a patient's decision to accept or refuse HCV treatment once offered. We conducted patient chart abstraction and surveys with 127 HIV coinfected patients who were offered HCV treatment by their provider and surveys of their HCV care providers at three HIV clinics. Participants were mostly male (87%), minority (66%), and had a history of injection drug use (60%). Most had been diagnosed with HIV for several years (X=13.7 years) and reported HIV transmission through unprotected sex (47%). Of the 127 patients, 79 accepted treatment. In multivariate analysis, patients who had a CD4 greater than 200 cells/mm(3) and a provider with more confidence about HCV treatment were more likely to accept the recommendation to start treatment; younger age was marginally associated with treatment acceptance. In bivariate analysis, added correlates of treatment acceptance included male gender, no recent drug use, and several provider attitudes regarding treatment and philosophy about determination of patient treatment readiness. Patient and provider characteristics are important when understanding a patient's decision to start or defer HCV treatment. Further research is needed to better understand barriers to treatment uptake as new and more effective HCV treatments will soon be available."
14771,0.015,3.0000,"D-Ala1-peptide T-amide (DAPTA) has shown neuroprotection in vitro against gp120-induced loss of dendritic arborization and is promulgated as a CCR5 antagonist. A multisite, randomized, double-blind clinical trial of DAPTA versus placebo prior to combination antiretroviral therapy conducted with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 seropositive participants having cognitive impairment showed no overall cognitive effect, though subgroups with greater impairment and CD4 cell counts of 201 to 500 cells/mm3 at baseline showed significant improvement. The objective of this study was to examine whether intranasal administration of DAPTA at a dose of 2 mg three times per day (tid) was associated with a reduction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral (plasma and serum) viral load among a subgroup of participants completing 6 months of treatment. Baseline and 6-month CSF (n = 92) and peripheral (plasma n = 33; serum n = 24) viral load were measured by the Roche Ultrasensitive assay, version 1.5, with reflexive use of the AMPLICOR assay and preservation of the blind. A DAPTA treatment indicator variable was tested using generalized linear models on change in viral load. Peripheral load (combined plasma and serum) was significantly reduced in the DAPTA-treated group. No group differences in CSF viral load were found. This retrospective study on a limited subgroup of the original trial sample indicated that DAPTA treatment may reduce peripheral viral load without concomitant CSF effects. Future studies should be undertaken to confirm the existence of this result and the CSF-periphery dissociation observed with respect to HIV-1-associated cognitive-motor impairment."
6292,0.015,3.0000,"In Vietnam, premature mortality due to AIDS-related conditions is commonly associated with late initiation to antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study explores reasons for late ART initiation among people living with HIV (PLHIV) from the perspectives of health care providers and PLHIV. The study was undertaken in six clinics from five provinces in Vietnam. Baseline CD4 counts were collected from patient records and grouped into three categories: very late initiators (≤100 cells/mm(3) CD4), late initiators (100-200 cells/mm(3)) and timely initiators (200-350 cells/mm(3)). Thirty in-depth interviews with patients who started ART and 15 focus group discussions with HIV service providers were conducted and thematic analysis of the content performed. Of 934 patients, 62% started ART very late and 11% initiated timely treatment. The proportion of patients for whom a CD4 count was obtained within six months of their HIV diagnosis ranged from 22% to 72%. The proportion of patients referred to ART clinics by voluntary testing and counselling centres ranged from 1% to 35%. Structural barriers to timely ART initiation were poor linkage between HIV testing and HIV care and treatment services, lack of patient confidentiality and a shortage of HIV/AIDS specialists. If Vietnam's treatment practice is to align with WHO recommendations then the connection between voluntary counselling and testing service and ART clinics must be improved. Expansion and decentralization of HIV/AIDS services to allow implementation at the community level increased task sharing between doctors and nurses to overcome limited human resources, and improved patient confidentiality are likely to increase timely access to HIV treatment services for more patients."
8395,0.015,3.0000,"Poor adherence to antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients increases the risk of incomplete viral suppression, development of viral resistance, progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome and death. This study assesses the impact of specific treatment-related adverse events (AEs) on adherence to ART in the adult HIV patient population. A systematic review of studies involving adult HIV-infected patients aged ≥ 16 years that reported an odds ratio (OR) for factors affecting adherence to ART was conducted through a search of the EMBASE(®) and Medline(®) databases. Database searches were complemented with a search of titles in the bibliographies of review papers. Studies conducted in populations limited to a particular demographic characteristic or behavioural risk were excluded. To qualify for inclusion into a meta-analysis, treatment-related AEs had to be defined similarly across studies. Also, multiple ORs from the same study were included where study sub-groups were distinct. Random effects models were used to pool ORs. In total, 19 studies and 18 ART-related AEs were included in meta-analyses. Adherence to ART was significantly lower in patients with non-specific AEs than in patients who did not experience AEs [OR = 0.623; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.465-0.834]. Patients with specific AEs such as fatigue (OR = 0.631; 95% CI: 0.433-0.918), confusion (OR = 0.349; 95% CI: 0.184-0.661), taste disturbances (OR = 0.485; 95% CI: 0.303-0.775) and nausea (OR = 0.574; 95% CI: 0.427-0.772) were significantly less likely to adhere to ART compared to patients without these AEs. Knowledge of specific treatment-related AEs may allow for targeted management of these events and a careful consideration of well-tolerated treatment regimens to improve ART adherence and clinical outcomes."
11097,0.015,3.0000,"The advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 1996 resulted in fewer patients experiencing clinical events, so that some prognostic analyses of individual cohort studies of human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals had low statistical power. Because of this, the Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration (ART-CC) of HIV cohort studies in Europe and North America was established in 2000, with the aim of studying the prognosis for clinical events in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the mortality of adult patients treated for HIV-1 infection. In 2002, the ART-CC collected data on more than 12,000 patients in 13 cohorts who had begun combination ART between 1995 and 2001. Subsequent updates took place in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010. The ART-CC data base now includes data on more than 70,000 patients participating in 19 cohorts who began treatment before the end of 2009. Data are collected on patient demographics (e.g. sex, age, assumed transmission group, race/ethnicity, geographical origin), HIV biomarkers (e.g. CD4 cell count, plasma viral load of HIV-1), ART regimen, dates and types of AIDS events, and dates and causes of death. In recent years, additional data on co-infections such as hepatitis C; risk factors such as smoking, alcohol and drug use; non-HIV biomarkers such as haemoglobin and liver enzymes; and adherence to ART have been collected whenever available. The data remain the property of the contributing cohorts, whose representatives manage the ART-CC via the steering committee of the Collaboration. External collaboration is welcomed.

2110,0.015,3.0000,"The update of these adult antiretroviral treatment (cART) recommendations has been carried out by consensus of a panel consisting of members of the Grupo de Estudio de Sida (Gesida, AIDS Study Group) and the Plan Nacional sobre el Sida (PNS, Spanish AIDS Plan) who have reviewed the antiretroviral efficacy and safety advances in clinical trials, cohort and pharmacokinetic studies published in medical journals (PubMed and Embase), or presented in medical scientific meetings. Three levels of evidence were defined according to the data source: randomized studies (level A), cohort or case-control studies (level B), and expert opinion (level C). The decision to recommend, consider or not to recommend antiretroviral treatment (ART) was established by consensus in each situation. The current treatment of choice for HIV infection is the combination of three drugs. Combined ART is recommended in patients with symptomatic HIV infection, and guidelines on this treatment in patients with an opportunistic type C infection are included. In asymptomatic patients, initiation of ART is recommended on the basis of CD4 lymphocyte counts, plasma viral load and patient co-morbidities, as follows: a) therapy should be started in patients with CD4 counts <350 cells/μL; b) Therapy should be recommended when CD4 counts are between 350 and 500 cells/μL, except when CD4 are stabilized, there is low plasma viral load, or the patient not willing; c) Therapy could be deferred when CD4 counts are above 500 cells/ μL, but should be considered in cases of cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis C, hepatitis B fulfilling treatment criteria, high cardiovascular risk, HIV nephropathy, viral load > 100,000 copies/ mL, proportion of CD4 cells < 14%, in people aged >55 years, and in cases of discordant serological sexual couples in order to reduce transmission. cART should include 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitor nucleoside analogues (AN) and a non-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NN) or 2 AN and a ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor (PI/ r), but other combinations are possible. The panel has consensually selected and prioritized some drug combinations, some of them co-formulated. The objective of cART is to achieve an undetectable viral load. Adherence to therapy plays an essential role in maintaining antiviral response. Therapeutic options are limited after cART failures, but undetectable viral load maybe possible with resistance genotypic studies. Adverse events are a decreasing problem of cART, where the benefits exceed the possible harm. cART in acute HIV infection, in women, pregnancy and prevention of mother to child transmission, and pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis are commented on. Management of hepatitis B or C co-infection is also commented on."
526,0.015,3.0000,"Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is a distinct subtype of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, originally described with a strong predilection to the oral cavity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. Data regarding patient age and gender, HIV status, initiation of and response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), tumor extent, pathology, treatment, and outcome were extracted from 112 cases of PBL identified in the literature. The median age at presentation was 38 years with a male predominance of 7:1, and the median CD4+ count was 178 cells/mm(3). PBL presented on average 5 years after diagnosis of HIV. Common primary sites of presentation included the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and lymph nodes. Most cases presented with either stage I or stage IV disease. There was a variable expression of B-cell markers in tumor cells, but plasma cell markers were expressed in all cases. EBV was detected in 74%. Chemotherapy was used to treat 55% patients and was combined with radiotherapy in 21% cases. Complete response was obtained in 66% of treated cases; the majority of these responses were seen after CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone). The refractory/relapsed disease rate was 54%. Death occurred in 53% of patients, with a median overall survival of 15 months. Sex, CD4+ count, viral load, clinical stage, EBV status, primary site of involvement, and use of CHOP failed to show an association with survival. PBL is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma that presents in both oral and extra-oral sites of chronically HIV-infected immunosuppressed young men."
6795,0.01,2.0000,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on treatment for tuberculosis (TB). The study population comprised 28,522 black Southern African gold miners. Patients with sputum culture-positive new or recurrent pulmonary TB diagnosed in 1995 were prospectively enrolled in the cohort. Directly observed therapy (DOT) was practiced and outcomes were assessed at 6 mo after treatment was begun. There were 376 cases of TB (incidence 1,318 per 100,000), of which 190 (50%) were HIV positive and 82 (22%) had recurrent TB. There was no association between HIV status and history of previous TB or drug resistance. Neither the treatment interruption rate (2%) nor the rate at which patients transferred out of the treatment program (1.6%) were associated with HIV status. Excluding deaths, cure rates were similar for HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients (89% versus 88%), but significantly lower in those with recurrent than in those with new TB (77% versus 92%). Mortality was 0.5% in HIV-negative patients versus 13.7% in HIV-positive patients, and in the latter group was associated with CD4(+) lymphocyte depletion. Autopsy examination showed that in HIV-positive patients, early mortality was due to TB whereas late deaths were most commonly due to cryptococcal pneumonia. The study showed that a well-run TB control program can result in acceptable cure rates even in a population with a very high incidence of TB and HIV infection. Particular vigilance is needed for concurrent infections, which may contribute significantly to mortality during treatment of TB in HIV-positive patients."
12733,0.01,2.0000,"Resistance to antiretroviral therapy (ART) threatens the success of programs to reduce HIV morbidity and mortality, particularly in countries with few treatment options. In the present study, genotype and phenotype data from ART-naïve and experienced hospitalized patients infected with HIV in Tehran, Iran were used to assess the prevalence and types of transmitted (TDR) and acquired drug resistance (ADR) mutations. All 30 participants naïve to ART and 62 of 70 (88.6%) participants receiving ART had detectable viral loads. Among participants receiving ART with sequencing data available (n = 62), 36 (58.1%) had at least one drug resistance mutation; the most common mutations were K103N (21.0%), M184V (19.4%), and the thymidine analogue mutations. Seven (11.3%), 27 (43.5%), and two (3.2%) of these participants had resistance to one, two, and three drug classes, respectively. High-level resistance to efavirenz (EFV) was more common among participants on EFV-based regimens than high-level lopinavir/ritonivar (LPV/r) resistance among those on LPV/r-based regimens (55.3% vs. 6.7%, P < 0.0001). Two (6.7%) antiretroviral-naïve participants had K103N mutations. These findings document an alarmingly high frequency of multiple HIV drug class resistance in Iran, confirm the presence of TDR, and highlight the need for systematic viral load monitoring and drug resistance testing, including at diagnosis. Expanded access to new antiretroviral medications from additional drug classes is needed."

In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of combination therapy with Peg-IFN plus ribavirin for the treatment of CHC in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)- and HIV+ patients with congenital bleeding disorders. Between 2000 and 2004, 50 (18-68 years old) patients with CHC (19 HIV+) from two hemophilia centers were included in the study. They were treated with weekly subcutaneous administration of Peg-INF-alpha combined with 800-1,200 mg ribavirin daily, for 24-48 weeks depending on viral genotype. Response was evaluated at weeks 12, 24, 48 (end of treatment response) and 72 had sustained virological response). Overall, 22/50 patients (43.8%) had end of treatment response and 20/50 (40%) sustained virological response. HIV- patients responded similarly to the general population (58.1%), while HIV+ patients had very low response rates (10.5%). The high rate of discontinuation (36.9%) as a result of side effects contributed to the observed low response rate in the HIV+ group. The only factor strongly associated with sustained virological response in the HIV- patients was the reduction of HCV RNA at 12 weeks (p = 0.001). Patients with viral genotypes other than 1 had higher SVR rates, but this was not found to be statistically significant. Peg-INF plus ribavirin is safe for the treatment of CHC monoinfected patients with inherited bleeding disorders, with similar response rates to nonhemophiliacs. On the contrary, in HIV coinfected hemophilic patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy it is associated with severe toxicity and very poor sustained virological response rates. Careful evaluation and several considerations are needed before starting treatment in this population."
7871,0.01,2.0000,"We estimated the impact of loss to follow-up (LTFU) on the mortality rate among HIV-1-infected patients in Curaçao. A total of 214 therapy-naive HIV-1-infected patients aged 15 years or older upon entering into HIV care between January 2005 and July 2009 were included. Persons who discontinued follow-up for more than 365 days were defined as LTFU and traced with the aim of registering their vital status. If no personal contact could be made, data were matched with the Curaçao National Death Registry. Mortality rates were estimated before and after starting combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). We used log-rank tests to compare survival rates among patients LTFU and patients who experienced continuous follow-up. Pre-cART mortality in patients LTFU was similar to pre-cART mortality in those with continuous follow-up (p=0.79). All pre-cART deaths occurred within 6 months after entry. Low CD4 cell count was predictive of a shorter time to death after entry. Adjusting for those who were LTFU, the mortality rate after starting cART increased from 4.3 to 5.5 per 100 person years of observation (p=0.06). Mortality after starting cART was highest in the first 2 months after starting cART, especially for those who had late disease stage. Mortality rates were lower in patients with continuous follow-up compared to LTFUs (p<0.001). Mortality rates in HIV-1-infected patients who have started cART in Curaçao are underestimated as a result of inefficient patient administration combined with people starting cART at a very late disease stage. Monitoring HIV treatment could help in reducing the risk of LTFU and may improve the effect of treatment."
19241,0.01,2.0000,"With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of opportunistic infections has declined substantially, and cardiovascular, liver, and renal diseases have emerged as major causes of morbidity and mortality in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Acute renal failure is common in HIV-infected patients and is associated with acute infection and medication-related nephrotoxicity. HIV-associated nephropathy is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease in HIV-positive African American populations and may respond to HAART. Other important HIV-associated renal diseases include HIV immune complex kidney diseases and thrombotic microangiopathy. The increasing importance of non-HIV-associated diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and vascular disease, to the burden of chronic kidney disease has been recognized, focusing attention on prevention and control of these diseases in HIV-positive individuals. HIV-positive individuals who experience progression to end-stage renal disease and who have undetectable HIV-1 viral loads while receiving HAART should be evaluated for renal transplant. Emerging evidence suggests that HIV-positive individuals may have graft and patient survival comparable to HIV-negative individuals. Several studies suggest that HIV-1 can potentially infect renal cells, and HIV transgenic mice have clarified the roles of a number of HIV proteins in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated renal disease. Host factors may modify disease expression at the level of cytokine networks and the renal microvasculature and contribute to the pathogenic effects of HIV-1 infection on the kidney."
2266,0.01,2.0000,"Experimental evidence from animal models has provided a framework for our current understanding of autoimmune disease pathogenesis and supports the importance of genetic predisposition, molecular mimicry, and immune dysregulation. However, only recently has evidence emerged to support the role of immune dysregulation in human organ-specific autoimmune disease. In the current study of the ""late"" manifestation of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) in a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients following highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we discuss how immune dysregulation and factors associated with the immunopathology of HIV infection fit the current understanding of autoimmunity and provide a plausible basis for our clinical observations. De novo diagnoses of thyroid disease were identified between 1996 and 2002 in 7 HIV treatment centers (5/7 centers completed the study). Patients were diagnosed as clinical case entities and not discovered through thyroid function test screening. Paired plasma specimens were used to demonstrate sequential rise in thyroid antibodies. Seventeen patients were diagnosed with AITD (median age, 38 yr; 65% were of black African or black Caribbean ethnicity; and 82% were female). The median duration of immune reconstitution was 17 months. Graves disease (GD) was diagnosed in 15 of 17 patients. One patient developed hashithyrotoxicosis with atypically raised C-reactive protein, and another developed hypothyroidism. One GD patient had associated secondary hypoadrenalism. The estimated combined prevalence of GD for 4 treatment centers for female patients was 7/234 and for males was 2/1289. The denominator numbers were matched controls, from 4 centers able to provide data, who commenced HAART during the same time (January 1996 to July 2002) and who did not develop clinical AITD. The mean baseline pre-HAART CD4 count was 67 cells/mL, and the mean increase from nadir to AITD presentation was 355 cells/mL. AITD patients were more likely than controls (95% confidence interval, chi-square test) to be severely compromised at baseline (as defined by a CD4 count < 200 cells/mL or the presence of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]-defining diagnosis), and to experience greater CD4 increments following HAART. AITD may be a late manifestation of immune reconstitution in HIV-positive patients taking HAART, and immune dysregulation may be an important factor."
2874,0.01,2.0000,"Data on the effects of sustained virologic response (SVR) to hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy on the outcome of extrahepatic complications are scarce. We conducted this study to assess the impact of SVR on the occurrence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. We analyzed coinfected HIV/HCV patients in the Management of Standardized Evaluation of Retroviral HIV Infection (MASTER) cohort. Only event-free patients with a serum HCV-RNA determination at baseline were included. Patients were divided into four groups: INF-exposed with SVR; INF-exposed without SVR; spontaneous HCV clearance; untreated viremic patients. We estimated the incidence of extrahepatic complications and employed Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression to assess the association of SVR/INF strata adjusted for a series of confounders. Data from 1676 patients were analyzed (20.29 % started an INF-based regimen). Overall, the incidence of CKD, DM, CVD, and death was 5.32 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3.99-6.98], 10.13 (95 % CI 8.20-12.37), 6.79 (95 % CI 5.26-8.65), and 13.49 (95 % CI 11.29-16.0) per 1000 person-years of follow-up, respectively. In the Cox model for treated patients, SVR was not associated with a lower risk of CKD, DM, CVD, and death compared to non-SVR. Cirrhosis was significantly associated with a higher risk of CKD [hazard ratio (HR) 2.13; 95 % CI 1.06-4.31], DM (HR 3.48; 95 % CI 2.18-5.57), and death (HR 6.18; 95 % CI 4.1-9.31), but not of CVD (HR 1.14; 95 % CI 0.57-2.3). There are still many unknowns regarding the impact of SVR on the occurrence of extrahepatic complications in coinfected HIV/HCV patients. Further investigations are needed in order to elucidate the role of SVR as an independent prognostic factor for extrahepatic events. "
4738,0.01,2.0000,"Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may lead to chronic HCV-infection with detectable HCV RNA or to spontaneous clearance with no HCV RNA, but detectable HCV antibodies. It is unknown whether HCV RNA status is associated with mortality in HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs). We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study to examine the impact of HCV RNA status on overall and cause-specific mortality in HIV-infected IDUs. We computed cumulative mortality and used Cox Regression to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRR). We identified 392 HIV-infected patients of whom 284 (72%) had chronic HCV-infection (HCV RNA positive patients) and 108 (28%) had cleared the HCV-infection (HCV RNA negative patients). During 1286 person-years of observation (PYR), 157 persons died (MR = 122/1000 PYR, 95% CI: 104-143). The estimated 5-year probabilities of survival were 0.58 (95% CI: 0.51-0.65) in the chronically HCV-infected and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.40-0.63) in the cleared HCV group. Chronic HCV-infection was not associated with overall mortality: MRR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.59-1.21. In HIV-infected Danish IDUs, chronic HCV-infection is not associated with increased mortality compared to patients who have cleared the infection."

This study examined ART treatment adherence and adherence self-efficacy among people living with HIV with a history of drug use in Vietnam. We used cross-sectional baseline data collected between October 2014 and February 2015 from a randomized controlled trial in Vietnam. Of the 900 persons with a history of drug use in the trial, a sample of 109 people living with HIV currently on ART were included in the study. The vast majority (92%) of the participants reported not missing any medications in the past 30 days. Multiple regression results indicated that social support was positively associated with adherence self-efficacy (β = 0.420, P < 0.001) and general adherence to ART (β = 0.201, P = 0.0368). General adherence to ART was negatively associated with depressive symptoms (β = -0.188, P = 0.046) and current heroin use (β = -0.196, P = 0.042). These findings underscore the importance of addressing mental health and social challenges facing people living with HIV with a history of drug use to promote ART treatment adherence. Clinical management of HIV should identify and address concurrent substance use behaviors to maximize adherence and treatment outcomes."

A cross-sectional study was conducted at two AIDS Outpatient Clinics in Brazil. The study included all HIV infected patients followed at these institutions from January 2005 to November 2007. Medical records of 2,024 HIV-infected patients were evaluated. The prevalence of anti-HCV positive patients among them was 16.7%. Medical records of HCV/HIV coinfected patients were analyzed. 189 patients with the following characteristics were included in our study: mean age 43 years; male gender 65%; former IDUs (52%); HCV genotype 1 (66.4%); HCV genotype 3 (30.5%); median CD4+ T cell count was 340 cells/mm³. Among 189 patients included in the analyses, only 75 (39.6%) were considered eligible for HCV treatment. The most frequent reasons for non-treatment were: non-compliance during clinical follow-up (31.4%), advanced HIV disease (21.9%), excessive alcohol consumption or active drug use (18.7%), and psychiatric disorders (10.1%)."
8787,0.01,2.0000,"The purpose of this study was to determine if a correlation exists between long-term azidothymidine (AZT) therapy and low pseudocholinesterase concentrations in patients who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A pilot study was conducted of 10 patients infected with HIV, 5 of whom were receiving AZT. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests, helper/inducer T lymphocyte numbers (CD4), serum dibucaine numbers, and serum pseudocholinesterase concentrations were examined. Control and study subjects both exhibited normal dibucaine numbers, but the pseudocholinesterase concentrations were significantly lower in the group that was not receiving AZT relative to the AZT treatment group. However, only two patients, neither of whom were receiving AZT, demonstrated low or borderline low pseudocholinesterase concentrations according to laboratory criteria. It is possible that pseudocholinesterase synthesis is significantly inhibited by the HIV disease process and that treatment with AZT partly reverses the inhibition. Associated variables contributing to low pseudocholinesterase concentrations in the HIV-positive patient are explored."

Free T4, free T3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were determined. Data on age, sex, weight variation, smoking status, duration of HIV infection, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention disease stage, CD4 cell count, HIV RNA load, lipodystrophy, HIV-hepatitis C virus coinfection, and antiretroviral treatment (type of drugs and total cumulative dose) were collected. The prevalence study included 350 HIV-infected patients. Sixteen percent of patients had hypothyroidism: 2.6% had overt hypothyroidism, 6.6% had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 6.8% had a low free T4 level. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism was higher among HIV-infected men than among HIV-infected women. A case-control study was conducted that compared hypothyroid (n=56) and euthyroid (n=287) patients. In the multivariate analysis, receipt of stavudine and low CD4 cell count were associated with hypothyroidism. Therefore, screening may be indicated for patients, especially men, who have received stavudine or have decreased CD4 cell counts."
5379,0.01,2.0000,"Paediatric Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection (HIV) nowadays is a chronic disease with an excellent long term prognosis, but lifelong combined antiretroviral treatment is required.

The highest risk of treatment toxicity is developing a complete metabolic syndrome including: Hyperlipemia, lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, lactic acidosis, osteopenia, hypertension, and specific system and organ toxicity, such as the kidney, liver, CNS or bone marrow. The risk of cardiovascular disease adult life and also definitive bone mass damage are the most significant metabolic costs that have to paid for increased survival. Most of these toxicities were able to be adequately treated but, pharmacological interferences, patient intolerance and the high number of drugs are the problems that limit the adherence to treatment, which is essential for a good therapeutical efficacy. In this article, we present four HIV paediatric patients who presented with almost the whole range of metabolic toxicities, and a practical overview of therapeutical management."
18666,0.01,2.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) allows for substantial control of HIV replication in vivo, and has caused a significant decline in morbidity and mortality rates among patients. However, eradication of the virus from the body is not possible. Therefore, HAART necessarily becomes a life-long treatment and this is associated with several problems: (i) the high cost of therapy; (ii) increased frequency of drug-related side effects; (iii) viral resistance; and (iv) poor patient adherence to the treatment. Based on these considerations, among other alternative strategies, structured treatment interruptions (STI) have been proposed with the potential object-ive of inducing immune-mediated control of HIV replication in HIV-infected patients. The available clinical data indicate that STI might increase HIV-specific, cell-mediated immune responses in patients treated during primary HIV infection; however, it does not seem to have the same effect in patients treated during chronic infection. Nevertheless, in chronically infected patients STI might limit drug-related side effects by decreasing exposure to drugs, without influencing the efficacy of the therapy. In addition, recent data suggest a possible role for immune-modulations such as hydroxyurea and therapeutic vaccines as adjuvant therapies for limiting viral rebound in these patients. Preliminary indications suggest that there is reduced hope for STI as a salvage therapy. Finally, it is important to stress that no controlled, randomized studies of STI have been held in humans, and it is not possible to evaluate fully the clinical impact of such a strategy. Therefore, clinicians and patients should avoid using STI outside the setting of controlled clinical trials."
1442,0.01,2.0000,"Treatment interruptions (TIs) limit the therapeutic success of combination antiretroviral therapy and are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. HIV-positive individuals dealing with concurrent health issues, access challenges and competing life demands are hypothesized to be more likely to interrupt treatment. Individuals were included if they initiated cART ≥1 year prior to interview date and had a CD4 cell count and initial regimen recorded at initiation. Using pharmacy recording, a TI was defined as a patient-initiated gap in treatment ≥90 consecutive days during the 12 months preceding or following the study interview. 117 (15.2 %) of 768 participants included in this study had a TI during the study window. 76.0 % of participants were male, 27.5 % were of Aboriginal ancestry and the median age was 46 (interquartile range 40-52). In multivariable logistic regression, TIs were significantly associated with current illicit drug use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.68, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.05-2.68); <95 % adherence in the first year of treatment (aOR 2.68, 95 % CI 1.67-4.12); living with at least one person (aOR 1.95; 95 % CI 1.22-3.14) or living on the street (aOR 5.08, 95 % CI 1.72-14.99) compared to living alone; poor perception of overall health (aOR 1.64 95 % CI 1.05-2.55); being unemployed (aOR: 2.22, 95 % CI 1.16-4.23); and younger age at interview (aOR 0.57, 95 % CI 0.44-0.75, per 10 year increase).

332,0.01,2.0000,"Coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in individuals infected with HIV is associated with a higher incidence of liver injury hepatic decompensation, and decreased survival than that observed in an HIV-monoinfected population. While prevalence studies on HIV/HCV coinfection have been performed in the U.S. and in some European countries, little is known about HCV genotype distribution in Latin America. The main objective was to evaluate the HCV prevalence and genotypes among HIV co-infected patients, and their relationship with HCV viral load, serum ALT level and T lymphocyte CD4+ cell count. These data pursue to increase the knowledge from South America about a pressing problem from HIV-infected patients. Retrospectively collected specimens from 593 HIV-positive individuals in Argentina were tested for anti-HCV These were analyzed for HCV-RNA qualitatively and quantitatively. The HCV genotype was determined by the RFLP method. One hundred and twenty-nine (21.7%) HIV-infected individuals were anti-HCV positive; 65.9% of them exhibited detectable HCV-RNA. Genotype 1 (43, la/c; 9, 1b; and 5, 1a/c+1b) was present in 57, while 1, 14 and 13 were infected with genotype 2, 3 or a mix, respectively. Co-infected individuals were more likely to be male, without significant differences in age and CD4+ cell counts than HIV-monoinfected individuals. HCV infection prevalence in patients co-infected with HIV highlights the impending public health impact of this problem. Considering the increasing rate of HCV genotypes with lower response rates to treatment among HIV co-infected patients, antiretroviral therapy success might be jeopardized by HCV coinfection."

However, little is known about the pharmacokinetics and drug interactions between TVR and antiretrovirals in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with advanced liver fibrosis. Here we report the pharmacokinetics of TVR and antiretrovirals in a cohort of HIV/HCV genotype 1-coinfected patients with advanced liver fibrosis treated with TVR-based triple anti-HCV therapy. No significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir, amprenavir or tenofovir at baseline and at Day 15 of TVR, whereas the AUC0-4h of darunavir was 36% lower in the presence of TVR (AUC0-4h 15007ngh/mL and 9563ngh/mL at baseline and at Day 15 of TVR administration, respectively). Noteworthy, the AUC0-4h, Cmin and Cmax of raltegravir were reduced by 61%, 50% and 64%, respectively. However, none of the patient's plasma levels of tenofovir, atazanavir, amprenavir or raltegravir declined below their minimum effective concentrations even in association with TVR, and no HIV treatment failure occurred. A non-significant trend for lower TVR exposure was seen in patients concomitantly given amprenavir versus those given atazanavir (AUC0-4h, 9840ngh/mL and 13345ngh/mL, respectively). In conclusion, this study highlighted the feasibility of maintaining the current antiretroviral regimen in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, even when significant interactions with TVR are predictable, whenever a change of HIV PIs is not deemed appropriate.

19993,0.01,2.0000,"Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, with superior efficacy and safety compared to interferon-based therapies. Despite these improvements, drug interactions with DAAs exist and may be clinically relevant in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-coinfected patients. We present a case of nephrotoxicity associated with concomitant use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and ledipasvir-sofosbuvir (LDV-SOF). A 56-year-old woman with HIV infection who had been taking efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine (EFV/TDF/FTC) for 6 years developed acute kidney injury 8 weeks after initiating LDV-SOF for the treatment of HCV infection. Her serum creatinine concentration peaked at 10 mg/dL, compared with her baseline concentration of 0.9-1 mg/dL. Kidney biopsy revealed acute tubular necrosis and acute interstitial nephritis. Both LDV-SOF and TDF were discontinued, and the patient's serum creatinine concentration decreased to 1.3 mg/dL over the following 6 weeks. We postulate that this adverse drug reaction may have been secondary to the known interaction between ledipasvir and TDF, which results in increased TDF exposure. Despite knowledge of this interaction, LDV-SOF is commonly prescribed in patients with HIV-HCV coinfection, as patients who received LDV-SOF- and TDF-containing regimens in trials have not demonstrated adverse clinical consequences related to this interaction. This case highlights the rare but potentially serious nephrotoxicity that can result from TDF toxicity and serves as a reminder to clinicians to implement close renal function monitoring in patients receiving both LDV-SOF and TDF. Clinicians prescribing LDV-SOF to HCV-HIV-coinfected patients receiving TDF should be cautious about use with concomitant nephrotoxic medications and monitor markers of tubular dysfunction, including urinary phosphorus excretion, and renal injury at baseline and week 4 of therapy. Tenofovir alafenamide and alternative DAAs may also have a role in the management of patients at high risk for renal adverse effects from TDF."
13298,0.01,2.0000,"To determine the efficacy of combined G-CSF and highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART), a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study was conducted. Treatment naive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients were randomized to receive either placebo or G-CSF (0.3 mg/ml, 3 times a week) for 12 weeks and HAART simultaneously. The trial was terminated prematurely after interim analysis performed because of a case of severe encephalopathia in the G-CSF group. At that point 11 HIV infected patients with a CD4+ T cell count < 350/mm3 had been randomized to the G-CSF group (n = 6) or placebo group (n = 5). In both groups plasma HIV RNA decreased significantly in response to HAART. However, plasma HIV RNA changed significantly different between the two groups with the decrease being less pronounced in the G-CSF group (P = 0.02). The concentrations of CD4+ memory T cells and CD8+ naive and memory T cells increased in response to HAART, and there was a trend towards more pronounced increases in several T-cell subpopulations in the G-CSF group. The CD56+ NK cells increased significantly more in the G-CSF group compared with placebo (P = 0. 000). All patients in the G-CSF group reported bone pain.

To examine food insecurity among HIV positive men and women who drink alcohol and its association with antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, health outcomes and health service utilization. Adults living with HIV (N = 183) in Atlanta, Georgia who reported alcohol use in the previous week and were receiving ART participated in a 12-month cohort. Participants were recruited from infectious disease clinics and social services to complete computerized interviews, monthly-unannounced pill counts to monitor ART adherence, and daily cell-phone delivered interactive-text assessments for alcohol use. Forty-three percent of participants experienced food insecurity during at least one month of the study period. Food insecurity was independently associated with suboptimal ART adherence and less suppressed HIV viral load over. Individuals who experienced food insecurity also had histories of more medical and psychiatric hospitalizations, and greater mental health problems. Food insecurity is prevalent among alcohol using people receiving ART and food insecurity is associated with treatment non-adherence, poor health outcomes, and increased medical and psychiatric hospitalizations."

One hundred and forty-six heterosexual male IVDUs attending a methadone-maintainance treatment program in Catanzaro were interviewed in order to obtain the following information: age, number of drug injections (calculated by multiplying the mean number of daily injections by 365 and then by the number of years of injections), number of injection equipment-sharing partners in the last year, number of sexual partners in the last year and possible IV cocaine use. Their sera were studied for the presence of antibodies to HIV, HBV and HCV by commercial enzyme-linked-immuno-sorbent assays run in duplicate. HIV positive samples were confirmed by Western Blot assay. Sixteen per cent of IVDUs were anti-HIV positive, 40% were anti-HBc positive and 68% were anti-HCV positive. Twenty-three per cent were seronegative and 12% were seropositive for all 3 viral markers. Multiple logistic analysis of HIV, HBV and HCV seropositivities in relation to age, number of drug injections, i.v. cocaine use and presence of injection equipment-sharing partners in the last year, showed that: a) older age (more than 27 years) was significantly associated with all 3 viral infections (mainly with HIV); b) i.v. cocaine use was associated with HBV, but even more with HIV; c) injection equipment-sharing partners in the last year was directly associated with HCV and inversely with HIV. No significant association was observed with the number of drug injections and the number of sexual partners. In conclusion, this study: a) demonstrates a difference of prevalence for HIV, HBV and HCV serum markers in this group of IVDUs from Catanzaro, Southern Italy; b) underlines the importance of i.v. cocaine use in the spreading of HIV; c) emphasizes the need of preventive strategies."
1399,0.01,2.0000,"Fat redistribution in the setting of protease inhibitor use is increasingly common and is associated with insulin resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. However, little is known regarding the factors that may contribute to abnormal insulin regulation in this population. We assessed fasting insulin levels in HIV-infected men and determined the relationship among insulin, body composition, endogenous gonadal steroid concentrations, and antiviral therapy in this population. We also determined the effects of exogenous testosterone administration using the homeostatic model for insulin resistance (HOMA IR) in hypogonadal HIV-infected men with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome wasting syndrome. Fifty HIV-infected men with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome wasting were compared with 20 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy control subjects. Insulin concentrations were significantly increased in HIV-infected patients compared to those in control patients (16.6+/-1.8 vs. 10.4+/-0.8 microU/mL; P<0.05) and were increased in nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NRTI)-treated patients who did not receive a protease inhibitor (PI; 21.7+/-4.3 vs. 10.4+/-0.8 microU/mL; P<0.05). Insulin concentrations and HOMA IR were inversely correlated with the serum free testosterone concentration (r = -0.36; P = 0.01 for insulin level; r = -0.30; P = 0.03 for HOMA), but not to body composition parameters, age, or BMI. In a multivariate regression analysis, free testosterone (P = 0.05), BMI (P<0.01), and lean body mass (P = 0.04) were significant. Lower lean body mass and higher BMI predicted increased insulin resistance. The HIV-infected patients demonstrated an increased trunk fat to total fat ratio (0.49+/-0.02 vs. 0.45+/-0.02; P<0.05) and an increased trunk fat to extremity fat ratio (1.27+/-0.09 vs. 0.95+/-0.06, P = 0.01), but a reduced extremity fat to total fat ratio (0.44+/-0.01 vs. 0.49 + 0.01; P = 0.02) and reduced overall total body fat (13.8+/-0.7 vs. 17.2+/-0.9 kg; P<0.01) compared to the control subjects. Increased truncal fat and reduced extremity fat were seen among NRTI-treated patients, but this pattern was most severe among patients receiving combined NRTI and PI therapy [trunk fat to extremity ratio, 1.47+/-0.15 vs. 0.95+/-0.06 (P<0.01); extremity fat to total fat ratio, 0.40+/-0.02 vs. 0.49+/-0.01 (P<0.05)]. Insulin responses to testosterone administration were investigated among 52 HIV-infected men with hypogonadism and wasting (weight <90% ideal body weight and/or weight loss >10%) randomized to either testosterone (300 mg, im, every 3 weeks) or placebo for 6 months. Testosterone administration reduced HOMA IR in the HIV-infected men (-0.6+/-0.7 vs. +1.41+/-0.8, testosterone vs. placebo, P = 0.05) in association with increased lean body mass (P = 0.02). These data demonstrate significant hyperinsulinemia in HIV-infected patients, which can occur in the absence of PI use. In NRTI-treated patients not receiving PI, a precursor phenotype is apparent, with increased truncal fat, reduced extremity fat, and increased insulin concentrations. This phenotype is exaggerated in patients receiving PI therapy, with further increased truncal fat and reduced extremity fat, although hyperinsulinemia per se is not worse. Endogenous gonadal steroid levels are inversely related to hyperinsulinemia in HIV-infected men, but reduced lean body mass and increased weight are the primary independent predictors of hyperinsulinemia. Indexes of insulin sensitivity improve in response to physiological androgen administration among hypogonadal HIV-infected patients, and this change is again related primarily to increased lean body mass in response to testosterone administration."
17557,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients increasingly experience the consequences of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. This trial randomized 107 patients coinfected with HIV and HCV to receive 48 weeks of interferon alfa-2b (IFN) 3 million units three times weekly plus either a full course of ribavirin (RBV) at 800 mg/day (group A; n = 53) or 16 weeks of placebo, followed by RBV (group B; n = 54). The primary endpoint of sustained viral response (SVR) rate (undetectable HCV RNA at posttreatment week 24) was not different between groups A (11.3%) and B (5.6%; P =.32). Within group A, the SVR rate was lower in genotype 1 (2.5%) than in genotypes 2 through 4 (41.7%; P =.002). Fifty-five patients discontinued therapy prematurely, mostly because of adverse events or patient decisions. At treatment week 12, the percentage of CD4+ cells rose in group A (+4.1%; P <.001), but not in group B (-0.3%). A significant proportion (22%) of patients who were HIV viremic at baseline had undetectable HIV RNA at week 12. By week 16, the hemoglobin level decreased more in group A (-2,52 g/dL) than in group B (-1.02 g/dL; P <.001). In group A, the hemoglobin decline was steeper in patients receiving zidovudine (azidothymidine [AZT], -3.64 g/dL vs. no AZT, -2.08 g/dL), and patients receiving zidovudine had more anemia-related RBV dose reductions (AZT, 60% vs. no AZT, 16%). In conclusion, HCV therapy with IFN plus RBV is relatively safe in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV, but frequent treatment discontinuations and anemia-related RBV dose reductions contribute to a poor SVR rate. Control of HIV infection improves rather than worsens during therapy."
12650,0.01,2.0000,"Sandfly fever is an infectious disease transmitted to people through sandfly bites. It usually takes three days and causes chills, high fever, headache, nausea-vomiting and myalgia. The causative agent, namely sandfly fever virus (SFV), is a member of the Bunyaviridae family, Phlebovirus genus. Toscana virus (TOSV) is a serotype of SFV, as so Sicilian and Naples viruses. Seroprevalence studies have demonstrated that SFV infections which have mild symptoms or asymptomatic, can be overcome. Studies concerning TOSV infections in Turkey are limited to a small number of regional seroprevalence surveys, blood-donor screening studies and detection of viral RNA in previously collected cerebrospinal fluid samples of suspected meningoencephalitis patients in whom no causative agents were identified. In this report from Turkey, the first acute case of TOSV infection diagnosed in a patient with HIV seropositivity, was presented. A 42-year-old male patient was admitted to Numune Research and Training Hospital Adana, Turkey with high fever, headache and malaise. The patient who lived in an area near to a forest in Istanbul, had no contact history with ticks, mosquitoes and other animals. He stated that he had had the symptoms before arriving to Adana. The patient was hospitalized due to leucopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia accompanying high fever. Serum samples were sent to National Arbovirus and Viral Zoonotic Diseases Unit of the Turkish Public Health Institute, for the detection of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus and SFV. Western Blot test was run to confirm the presence of anti-HIV antibodies detected twice with ELISA. In the following days, the patient's fever and symptoms decreased, and thrombocyte levels increased. Although CCHF virus PCR and ELISA IgM tests as well as SFV IgM and IgG immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) tests were negative, real time reverse transcriptase PCR test yielded a positive result for TOSV. SFV IgG antibodies against Toscana and Naples viruses were found to be positive in the serum sample collected at the end of a three-week follow-up. Even though TOSV infection is usually known to have an asymptomatic clinical course, it may rarely lead to serious manifestations like meningoencephalitis. In our country where SFV is endemic, TOSV should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with high fever and meningoencephalitis symptoms. "
10440,0.01,2.0000,"Women with perinatally acquired HIV (PAH) face unique psychosocial challenges due to the presence of a lifelong chronic illness and often unstable living situations. With advances in HIV treatment, an increasing number of those with PAH are reaching childbearing age and becoming pregnant. Depression may be an important and common factor that complicates both treatment and pregnancy outcomes in this group. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in pregnant patients with PAH to determine if history of depression is associated with nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We reviewed charts of women with PAH receiving prenatal care at a single institution from March 1995 to December 2012. ART nonadherence was measured by patient self-report of any missed doses in the third trimester. Demographic, obstetric, and HIV infection characteristics of patients with a history of depression (dPAH) were compared to patients without a history of depression. Nine pregnancies among 6 dPAH women and 14 pregnancies among 12 PAH women without a history of depression were identified. None of the dPAH women reported 100% adherence to ART in the third trimester while 57% of women without a history of depression reported strict adherence (p = 0.04). The mean HIV RNA level at delivery was higher among dPAH women (17,399 vs. 2966 copies/Ml; p = 0.03) and fewer reached an undetectable HIV RNA level (<400 copies/mL) at delivery (p = 0.03). We concluded that a history of depression may contribute to poor medication adherence and treatment outcomes among pregnant women with PAH. Focused attention on diagnosis and treatment of depression in the preconception period may lead to more optimal medication adherence. "
8282,0.01,2.0000,"The T cell receptor excision DNA circle (TREC) level is an independent predictor of HIV-1 disease prognosis. We studied the temporal changes in TREC levels prior to and after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in a cohort of 131 Greek men with hemophilia who were followed up for up to 20 years since seroconversion (SC). TREC levels were determined in all available cryopreserved samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Trends in log(10) TREC values were described using random effects models. Prior to HAART initiation TREC levels tended to decrease over time (mean rate of drop 19% per year; 95% CI: 16-22%). Initial TREC values were higher with younger age at SC, but the subsequent rate of drop did not differ significantly by age at SC. There was a monotonic relationship between baseline HIV-RNA levels and TREC slopes with steeper slopes at higher levels of HIV-RNA. The TREC slopes differed significantly by clinical outcome being steeper in subjects who progressed to AIDS sooner. After HAART initiation, TREC values tended to increase on average by 35% per year (95% CI: -7-94%) but the increase was evident only in subjects with a pre-HAART CD4 count below 80 cells/microl. TREC values, which likely represent a simple indicator of naive T-lymphocyte reserve, may be a clinically useful marker for long-term prognosis of HIV-1 infection and for immune reconstitution after successful HAART."
7738,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry inhibitors have been hypothesized to prevent infection of the liver after transplantation. ITX5061 is a scavenger receptor class B type I antagonist that blocks HCV entry and infection in vitro. We assessed the safety and efficacy of ITX5061 to limit HCV infection of the graft. The study included 23 HCV-infected patients undergoing liver transplantation. The first 13 ""control"" patients did not receive drug. The subsequent 10 patients received 150 mg of ITX5061 immediately before and after transplant and daily for 1 week thereafter. ITX5061 pharmacokinetics and plasma HCV RNA were quantified. Viral genetic diversity was measured by ultradeep pyrosequencing (UDPS). ITX5061 was well tolerated with measurable plasma concentrations during therapy. Although the median HCV RNA reduction was greater in ITX-treated patients at all time points in the first week after transplantation, there was no difference in the overall change in the area over the HCV RNA curve in the 7-day treatment period. However, in genotype (GT) 1-infected patients, treatment was associated with a sustained reduction in HCV RNA levels compared to the control group (area over the HCV RNA curve analysis, P = 0.004). UDPS revealed a complex and evolving pattern of HCV variants infecting the graft during the first week. ITX5061 significantly limited viral evolution where the median divergence between day 0 and day 7 was 3.5% in the control group compared to 0.1% in the treated group. In conclusion, ITX5061 reduces plasma HCV RNA after transplant notably in GT 1-infected patients and slows viral evolution. Following liver transplantation, the likely contribution of extrahepatic reservoirs of HCV necessitates combining entry inhibitors such as ITX5061 with inhibitors of replication in future studies."
19533,0.01,2.0000,"Indonesia has the third highest number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) and the greatest increase in proportion of AIDS-related mortality in the Asia Pacific region between 2005 and 2013. Longitudinal mortality data among PLWH in Indonesia are limited. We conducted a retrospective cohort study from medical records of antiretroviral treatment (ART) recipients attending Badung General Hospital (BGH) and Bali Medica Clinic (BMC) between 2006 and 2014. We explored incidence of mortality by Kaplan-Meier analysis and identified predictors using a Cox proportional hazard model. In total, 575 patients were included in the analysis; the majority were male. The overall mortality rate was 10% per year. Multivariate analysis suggested that being male (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 2.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.34-5.59), having a lower education (aHR: 2.17; 95%CI: 1.31-3.61), having heterosexual (aHR: 7.40; 95% CI: 2.61-21.00) or injecting drug use (aHR: 13.20; 95% CI: 3.17-55.00) as the likely transmission risk category, starting treatment with low CD4 cell counts (aHR: 3.18; 95% CI: 1.16-8.69), and not having a treatment supervisor (aHR: 4.02; 95% CI: 2.44-6.65) were independent predictors of mortality. The mortality was high, particularly in the first three months after initiating ART. These findings highlight the need to encourage HIV testing and early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Applying aspects of BMCs targeted HIV services model in more generalised services such as BGH may be beneficial. Providing adherence support as part of ART services is key to promoting adherence to ART."
6508,0.01,2.0000,"This study set out to examine the relative effectiveness and tolerability of 12- versus 24-week courses of thrice weekly intramuscular lymphoblastoid interferon in the treatment of hepatitis B 'e' antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and to identify pretreatment factors predicting the outcome of therapy. Twenty patients were randomised to each treatment group. Treatment was associated with clearance of HBeAg and HBV-DNA in 59% of the 32 male patients, whereas none of the eight women responded (48% overall response rate). This response rate in males is at least three times the recorded spontaneous seroconversion rates in this population. Most of the women (5/8) were of Oriental origin and had minimal disease, factors that may have influenced response. The longer course was poorly tolerated and was therefore no more effective: eight of 20 patients withdrew because of side-effects. Variables associated with response included high AST (aspartate transaminase), short duration of disease and previous history of acute hepatitis. A response to antiviral therapy was accompanied by clinical and biochemical evidence of improvement in liver disease."
18294,0.01,2.0000,"Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), the first nucleotidic inhibitor of HIV reverse transcription, became available in 2001. It has been extensively used worldwide and is now the most prescribed antiretroviral (ARV) drug. Its high antiviral activity and favorable metabolic profile are responsible for its success. Furthermore, TDF has been associated with other ARVs to form new combined antiretroviral treatments in only one tablet once-a-day, which increases treatment adherence. Fears of potential nephrotoxicity that tenofovir would have in common with two other drugs from the same family (adefovir, used to treat hepatitis B, and cidofovir, used to treat cytomegalovirus infections) were alleviated by the early clinical trials. Yet, in 2001, the first case of TDF-induced acute nephrotoxicity was published. Numerous cases have been published since then, and it is now established that TDF presents a tubular toxicity risk. Some facilitating factors have been identified, such as co-prescription of didanosine or boosted protease inhibitor, preexisting CKD, low body weight, and associated diabetes mellitus. Conversely, whether TDF is nephrotoxic in the long term is a highly debated question. Some studies suggest a decreased GFR when TDF is prescribed for a long period, while others indicate that TDF is safe for the kidneys even after many years of use. Here we review the differences in patient characteristics, study designs, and measured outcomes that can possibly explain these conflicting findings. We conclude with rational recommendation for appropriate TDF prescription. "
2859,0.01,2.0000,"CD8 T-cell responses are thought to be crucial for control of viremia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection but ultimately fail to control viremia in most infected persons. Studies in acute infection have demonstrated strong CD8-mediated selection pressure and evolution of mutations conferring escape from recognition, but the ability of CD8 T-cell responses that persist in late-stage infection to recognize viruses present in vivo has not been determined. Therefore, we studied 24 subjects with advanced HIV disease (median viral load = 142,000 copies/ml; median CD4 count = 71/ micro l) and determined HIV-1-specific CD8 T-cell responses to all expressed viral proteins using overlapping peptides by gamma interferon Elispot assay. Chronic-stage virus was sequenced to evaluate autologous sequences within Gag epitopes, and functional avidity of detected responses was determined. In these subjects, the median number of epitopic regions targeted was 13 (range, 2 to 39) and the median cumulative magnitude of CD8 T-cell responses was 5,760 spot-forming cells/10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (range, 185 to 24,700). On average six (range, one to 8) proteins were targeted. For 89% of evaluated CD8 T-cell responses, the autologous viral sequence was predicted to be well recognized by these responses and the majority of analyzed optimal epitopes were recognized with medium to high functional avidity by the contemporary CD8 T cells. Withdrawal of antigen by highly active antiretroviral therapy led to a significant decline both in breadth (P = 0.032) and magnitude (P = 0.0098) of these CD8 T-cell responses, providing further evidence that these responses had been driven by recognition of autologous virus. These results indicate that strong, broadly directed, and high-avidity gamma-interferon-positive CD8 T-cells directed at autologous virus persist in late disease stages, and the absence of mutations within viral epitopes indicates a lack of strong selection pressure mediated by these responses. These data imply functional impairment of CD8 T-cell responses in late-stage infection that may not be reflected by gamma interferon-based screening techniques."
5131,0.01,2.0000,"We have used a V3-specific heteroduplex tracking assay (V3-HTA) with probes from two different human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes to examine the extent and pace of HIV-1 evolution late in infection. Twenty-four subjects with advanced HIV-1 infection (CD4(+) T-cell count, <100/microl) and stable viral loads were studied using blood plasma samples collected over a study period of approximately 9 months, during which time most of the subjects were treated with reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The V3-HTA patterns from the first and last time points were evaluated initially to determine the amounts of change in V3 sequence populations, which were primarily changes in abundance in preexisting sequence populations. Three of the 24 subjects had major changes (greater than 50% total change in the relative abundance of the sequence populations), 11 subjects had intermediate changes (10 to 50% total change), and 10 subjects had minimal changes (less than 10% total change). The average total amount of change was between two- and threefold greater in subjects with X4-like variants, although there was no correlation between average viral load and the presence of X4-like variants. V3-HTA patterns in monthly samples from 11 of the subjects were also compared. In two subjects, the amount of change exceeded 40% in a 1-month period. Overall, the pace of change in V3 populations varied between subjects and was not constant within a subject over time. Sequence analysis of the V3 variants showed that R5-like variants (not containing any X4-associated substitutions) continued to be maintained in three subjects in the presence of X4-like variants, indicating that X4 variants do not always outgrow R5 variants. The coreceptor usage of the V3 sequences from two subjects was determined using a cell fusion assay. One subject had an X4 variant that was maintained at a low level for at least 9 months, during which time the predominant variants were R5X4 (dualtropic), while in the second subject the reverse situation was observed. One of the dualtropic variants had a novel sequence motif in V3, suggesting another evolutionary pathway to altered tropism. These studies begin to probe the complexities and pace of V3 evolution in vivo, revealing dynamic patterns of change among multiple V3 sequence variants in a subset of subjects."
19336,0.01,2.0000,"Factors associated with undetectable viral load (<80 copies/ml) were investigated among non-pregnant adults in antiretroviral treatment in a specialized service for HIV/AIDS in Southern Brazil. Use of antiretrovirals was investigated in two interviews (one month interval). Clinical data were collected from the clinical records; viral load previous to adherence measurement was defined the viral load previous to the first interview; the final viral load, the viral load subsequent to the second interview (interval between measures approximately 6 months). Undetectable final viral load occurred in 48% of the patients and was positively associated with levels of treatment adherence (p<0.001), being 19% for less than 60% of adherence and about 60% for adherence greater than 80%. In the multivariate model, the odds of undetectable final viral load was four times greater for 80-94% and > or =95% of adherence (CI 95% 1,80-13,28; CI 95% 1,73-9,53), compared with less than 60% adherence; it was greater for less than 6 months in treatment (OR = 3.37; CI 95% 1.09-10.46); and smaller for viral load previous to adherence measurement 5.2 log10 (OR = 0.19; CI95% 0.06-0.58), adjusted for these variables and sex, age, clinical status, current immune status, group of drugs and interval between the two measurements of viral load. The crude odds were lower for age 16-24 years and use of Nucleoside Analog Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors only, but these effects were not significant in the multivariate model. There was no evidence of effect of sex, clinical status, current immune status, and changes in treatment regimen. Treatment adherence gave the largest effect. Motivational interventions directed at adherence may improve treatment effectiveness."
15348,0.01,2.0000,"Interferon-α (IFN-α) treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) is complicated by depression and related neurovegetative side effects. Recent genome-wide scans identified IL28B gene polymorphisms that associated with HCV clearance. Whether the IL28B polymorphism is also associated with these adverse effects of IFN-α would affect its clinical usefulness. One hundred thirty-three patients were prospectively examined using the Beck Depression Inventory-II and a Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) during IFN-α treatment. The candidate C/T single-nucleotide polymorphism upstream from IL28B (rs1297860) was genotyped and assessed for association with individual items from the Beck Depression Inventory-II. We confirmed that the IL28B polymorphism was associated with differences in sustained viral response (F = 3.38; P < 0.05), with the T/T genotype faring worst. However, the T/T genotype was associated with less appetite (P < 0.05), energy (P < 0.05), and sleep complaints (P < 0.05) during treatment. Only 3.1% of patients with T/T developed major appetite complaints, whereas 10.1% and 8.9% of those with the C/T and C/C genotype did, respectively. Only 10.8% of patients with T/T developed major sleep complaints, whereas 16.1% and 20.7% of those with the C/T and C/C genotype did. However, IL28B genotype did not predict development of major depressive disorder (χ(2) = 0.12; P = 0.94). The allele (C) was associated with both better viral clearance and more subjective appetite, energy, and sleep complaints. This has implications for the management of patients with HCV. If genotyping is used to better target therapy, this may co-enrich the population for likelihood of also suffering from these side effects."
10422,0.01,2.0000,"The declining incidence of AIDS-related opportunistic diseases among people with HIV infection has shifted the focus of clinical management to prevention and treatment of comorbidities such as chronic liver disease. The increased risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related advanced liver disease in people with HIV infection makes early HCV diagnosis a priority. To assess HCV prevalence and predictors of HIV/HCV coinfection, we have conducted a retrospective analysis of people enrolled in the CAESAR (Canada, Australia, Europe, South Africa) study, a multinational randomized placebo-controlled study of the addition of lamivudine to background antiretroviral therapy. The impact of HCV on HIV disease progression was also examined. Anti-HCV antibody testing on 1649 CAESAR study participants demonstrated a HIV/HCV coinfection prevalence of 16.1%, which varied from 1.9% in South Africa to 48.6% in Italy. The strongest predictor of HIV/HCV coinfection was HIV exposure category (P<0.0001), with odds ratios (ORs) compared to homosexual as follows: injecting drug use (IDU), 365 [95% confidence interval (CI): 179-742]; transfusion or blood products, 32.2 (95% CI: 15.2-67.6); homosexual and IDU, 22.9 (95% CI: 8.5-62.1). The prevalence of HIV/HCV was low (3.7%) among homosexual men without reported IDU. Other predictors of HIV/HCV coinfection were alanine aminotransferase (ALT), country of residence, ethnicity and stage of HIV disease. A history of IDU or ALT > or =40 U/L at baseline had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 35%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 96%, sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 71% for HIV/HCV coinfection. HIV disease progression was similar in HIV monoinfected and HIV/HCV coinfected patients. People with HIV and a history of IDU or elevated liver function tests should be targeted for HCV testing. The low prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection among homosexual men without a history of IDU suggests low efficiency of sexual HCV transmission."
15848,0.01,2.0000,"HIV-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are at increased risk of cardiovascular events. Reported non-invasive techniques for assessment of blood pressure in this population have been limited to sphygmomanometry. The present crosssectional study investigated the impact of antiretroviral therapy and the HAART-associated lipodystrophy on aortic blood pressure conditions and arterial stiffness in HAART-treated lipodystrophic (n=42) and non-lipodystrophic (n=17) patients. Pulse wave analysis, novel to this population, was used to evaluate measures of arterial stiffness, including the heart rate corrected augmentation index, AgI(HR). Results indicated no significant difference between the study groups in peripheral or aortic blood pressure and AgI(HR). Significant correlates of AgI(HR) included age (P = 0.003), duration of antiretroviral therapy (P = 0.020), lamivudine therapy (P = 0.015) and ritonavir therapy (P = 0.016) as well as cumulative exposure to protease inhibitors (P = 0.030). Time since HIV diagnosis, severity of immunodeficiency or presence of HAART-associated lipodystrophy bore no relationship to AgI(HR). In multivariate analysis, duration of antiretroviral therapy (P = 0.046), cumulative exposure to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (P = 0.032) and to protease inhibitors (P = 0.011) were identified as independent factors predicting AgI(HR). Prolonged antiretroviral treatment, thus, delineates as a risk factor for systemic arterial stiffness and the associated cardiovascular mortality."
18801,0.01,2.0000,"Prevalence and risk factors for hepatic steatosis (HS) in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive population of western countries are controversially discussed and potentially confounded by coinfection with viral hepatitis. Significant HS (more than 10% of hepatocytes) can be accurately assessed using controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) determination. Aim of this study was to assess prevalence and factors associated with significant HS in HIV monoinfected patients.A total of 364 HIV-infected patients (289 monoinfected) were included in this prospective, cross-sectional study. All patients underwent CAP determination. Steatosis was classified as S1 (significant steatosis) with CAP > 238 dB/m, S2 with CAP > 260 dB/m, and S3 with CAP > 292 dB/m. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the factors associated with HS in this cohort.Significant HS was detected in 118 monoinfected patients (149 in the total cohort). In the total cohort as well as in the monoinfected patients alone, HS grade distribution showed a similar pattern (S1:29%, S2:34%, and S3:37%). Interestingly, patients with HS had a longer history of HIV infection and combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Interalia, age, gender, ethnicity, and metabolic factors were strongly associated with HS, while body mass index (BMI), triglyceride, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were independently associated with significant HS.HS is highly prevalent among HIV monoinfected patients. Although metabolic risk factors, such as obesity and poorly controlled diabetes, are independently associated with HS in HIV monoinfected patients, cART and control of HIV seem to play an indirect role in the development of HS, probably through the return-to-health effect."
6052,0.01,2.0000,"Whether initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens aimed at achieving greater concentrations within gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) impacts the level of mucosal immune reconstitution, inflammatory markers and the viral reservoir remains unknown. We included 12 HIV- controls and 32 ART-naïve HIV patients who were randomized to efavirenz, maraviroc or maraviroc+raltegravir, each with fixed-dose tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine. Rectal and duodenal biopsies were obtained at baseline and at 9 months of ART. We performed a comprehensive assay of T-cell subsets by flow cytometry, T-cell density in intestinal biopsies, plasma and tissue concentrations of antiretroviral drugs by high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy, and plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), soluble CD14 (sCD14) and zonulin-1 each measured by ELISA. Total cell-associated HIV DNA was measured in PBMC and rectal and duodenal mononuclear cells. Twenty-six HIV-infected patients completed the follow-up. In the duodenum, the quadruple regimen resulted in greater CD8+ T-cell density decline, greater normalization of mucosal CCR5+CD4+ T-cells and increase of the naïve/memory CD8+ T-cell ratio, and a greater decline of sCD14 levels and duodenal HIV DNA levels (P = 0.004 and P = 0.067, respectively), with no changes in HIV RNA in plasma or tissue. Maraviroc showed the highest drug distribution to the gut tissue, and duodenal concentrations correlated well with other T-cell markers in duodenum, i.e., the CD4/CD8 ratio, %CD4+ and %CD8+ HLA-DR+CD38+ T-cells. Maraviroc use elicited greater activation of the mucosal naïve CD8+ T-cell subset, ameliorated the distribution of the CD8+ T-cell maturational subsets and induced higher improvement of zonulin-1 levels. These data suggest that combined CCR5 and integrase inhibitor based combination therapy in ART treatment naïve patients might more effectively reconstitute duodenal immunity, decrease inflammatory markers and impact on HIV persistence by cell-dependent mechanisms, and show unique effects of MVC in duodenal immunity driven by higher drug tissue penetration and possibly by class-dependent effects.

We studied 129 antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive HIV-1 infected patients who received an antiretroviral regimen of lamivudine, efavirenz and Tenofovir GPO300 (n = 65) or Viread (n = 64). We examined plasma tenofovir concentrations (12 hours after dosing), serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Modification in Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study formula, fractional excretion of phosphate (FEphos), CD4 and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at 12 weeks, and CD4 and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at 24 weeks after initiating the drugs. At baseline, the mean ± SD subject body weight was 54 ± 10 kilograms and the mean ± SD subject age was 37 ± 8 years. At baseline, the median (IQR) CD4 count was 44 (18-120) cells/ mm3 and the median (IQR) HIV-1 RNA level was 5.8 log copies/ml. At baseline, the mean ± SD eGFR was 134.8 ± 43.6 ml/min/1.73 m2. The baseline values for the two groups were not significantly different from each other (p > 0.05). At 12 weeks, the mean ± SD plasma tenofovir concentration was 106.9 ± 41.5 ng/ml among the patients who received Tenofovir GPO300 and 100.7 ± 49.4 ng/ml among those who received Viread (p = 0.437). At week 12, there were no differences between those who rceived Tenofovir GPO300 and Vilead in mean serum creatinine (0.78 vs 0.81 mg/dl, p = 0.283), mean eGFR (117.9 vs 109.1 ml/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.089), decline in eGFR from baseline (-21.8 vs -20.6 ml/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.860) or mean FEphos (11.4 vs 11.2, p = 0.923). The median CD4 cell counts and number of patients with undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA at week 24 were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between those who took Tenofovir GPO300 and Viread. In summary, plasma tenofovir concentrations, changes in renal function, urinary phosphate excretion and treatment responses were comparable between HIV-infected patients who received Tenofovir GPO300 and Viread-containing non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase regimens."
1687,0.01,2.0000,"Increasing prevalence of thyroid function abnormality has been reported in HIV-infected patients. We aim to evaluate the prevalence and assess risk factors of thyroid dysfunction in Thai HIV-infected patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted. Serum thyroid hormone concentrations (FT4, FT3, and TSH) and thyroid autoantibodies (TgAb and TPOAb) were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. A total of 200 HIV-infected outpatients were included. Ninety-seven patients (48.5%) were men (mean age of 36.3 +/- 8.3 years). Duration of HIV infection was 49.6 +/- 35.1 months and 53% had previous opportunistic infections (OI). Mean CD4 cell count was 340.6 +/- 173.1 cells/mm(3). Of these, 167 patients (83.5%) received antiretroviral therapy (ARV). Abnormal thyroid function test was detected in 32 patients (16%). Twenty-seven patients (13.5%) had decreased thyroid function (primary hypothyroidism 3, subclinical hypothyroidism 12, and low FT4 with low or normal TSH 12) whereas 5 patients had increased thyroid function (overt hyperthyroidism 1, subclinical hyperthyroidism 1, and isolated high FT3 3). None had clinical features of thyroid hormone dysfunction. Thirteen patients (6.5%) had thyroid antibody positive. Patients who received ARV had higher mean FT3 levels than those who were naïve to ARV (p = 0.017). History of previous OI was found to be an independently significant risk factor for decreased thyroid function with the odds ratio of 3.28 (95% CI =1.183-9.099; p = 0.022). Hypothyroidism was common among Thai HIV-infected patients, especially in those who had history of previous OI. It is therefore suggested that screening and/or monitoring of thyroid hormone in HIV-infected patients should be considered."

We evaluated a population of MSM with acute hepatitis C. From January 2010 to May 2014, all cases of HCV antibody positive HIV-negative MSM were identified. European AIDS Network criteria were applied to determine acute infection, and 44 individuals fulfilled the criteria for acute hepatitis C. Ten were RNA negative at baseline and classed as prior spontaneous clearance. 15 (34.1%) had a previously negative HCV antibody within 1 year. 11 (25.0%) had significant elevation in ALT levels, and 18 (40.9%) were clinically diagnosed from risk exposure and history. Median age was 37 years (range 24-75). 41 (93.2%) individuals reported unprotected anal sex, 36 with (87.8%) both insertive and receptive intercourse, 4 (9.8%) with receptive intercourse, 1 (2.4%) with insertive intercourse, and no data were recorded for 3 (7.3%) patients. Individuals had an average of 7.3 reported (median 2, range 1-100) partners. 12 (27.3%) engaged in group sex, 11 (25.0%) practised fisting, 11 (25.0%) admitted using drugs during sexual activity, 16 (36.4%) reported nasal, and 9 (20.5%) reported injection drug use. 14 (31.8)% had unprotected sex whilst under the influence of recreational drugs. 29 individuals were aware of a partner's status. 2 (4.5%) individuals had sexual contact with a known HCV monoinfected partner, 13 (29.5%) with a HIV monoinfected partner and 6 (13.6%) with a HCV/HIV coinfected partner. 9 (20.5%) reported a partner/partners with no known infection. No data were available in 14 (31.8%) individuals. 13 (29.5%) individuals had a coexisting STI at the time of acute HCV diagnosis. 8 (18.2%) received HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) within the 6 months prior to the HCV diagnosis (2 were participants in a HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis trial). 15 (34.1%) individuals achieved spontaneous clearance of HCV, and 11 patients received HCV treatment. Similar to the ongoing epidemic of acute HCV infection in HIV+ MSM, HIV-negative MSM remain at risk."
19715,0.01,2.0000,"Older HIV-positive patients may experience reduced benefit and increased toxicities from combination antiretroviral therapies (cART) due to late diagnosis, weakened immune systems, and other age-related physiological changes. This study investigates the effect of age on time to virologic suppression and CD4 cell count response to cART. Data were collected from a tertiary care immunodeficiency clinic in Toronto. HIV-positive patients with cART initiation after 1/1/1998 were included. Log logistic accelerated failure time models were used to estimate the effect of age on time to virologic suppression. Mixed linear models were used to evaluate CD4 cell response to treatment. A total of 502 patients were studied; 445 were less than 50 years old and 57 were age 50 or over. Of these 73% were male. Thirty-one percent started treatment with boosted protease inhibitors and 43% with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. In a log logistic model adjusting for gender, immigration status, AIDS-defining illness, years since HIV diagnosis, baseline CD4 count and viral load, cART type, calendar year of cART initiation, and hepatitis C diagnosis, older age was not associated with time to virologic suppression (n=418, time ratio=0.94, p=0.20). In a multivariable mixed linear regression model adjusting for the same covariates, age was not associated with CD4 cell count response (n=418, β=0.34, p=0.96). Time to virologic suppression and immunologic response were not significantly different among older and younger patients. Further studies should investigate adherence, comorbidities, and regimen changes in addition to the current covariates."
13617,0.01,2.0000,"The Patient Medication Adherence Questionnaire Version 1.0 (PMAQ-V1.0) is a patient-reported adherence instrument to assess medication-taking behaviors and identify barriers to adherence with antiretroviral therapy. To assess the correlation between adherence and virologic outcome, the PMAQ-V1.0 was administered to 194 antiretroviral-experienced adults with HIV infection enrolled in a 16-week evaluation of protease inhibitor-containing regimens featuring a lamivudine/zidovudine combination tablet. At baseline, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were less than 10,000 copies/mL and CD4(+)-cell counts were equal to or greater than 300 x 10(6)/L; patients had been receiving a conventional regimen of lamivudine + zidovudine (separately) plus a protease inhibitor for at least 10 weeks immediately prior to the study. Forty-eight percent of patients who reported missing at least one dose of a nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) during the study had detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA, compared with 26% of patients who reported no missed doses (P = .002). Patients who missed at least one dose of an NRTI or protease inhibitor were 2.5 times more likely to have quantifiable HIV-1 RNA than those who reported no missed doses. Patients who reported fewer barriers and more motivators to adherence had better virologic outcomes (P = .001). Several dimensions of the PMAQ-V1.0 did not function as well as hypothesized. In this study, self-reported adherence derived from the PMAQ-V1.0 predicted virologic outcomes, but further refinement of the dimensions appears warranted."
13002,0.01,2.0000,"Population-based estimates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence and risk behaviors among men who have sex with men (MSM) are valuable for HIV prevention planning but not widely available, especially at the local level. We combined two population-based data sources to estimate prevalence of diagnosed HIV infection, HIV-associated risk-behaviors, and HIV testing patterns among sexually active MSM in New York City (NYC). HIV/AIDS surveillance data were used to determine the number of living males reporting a history of sex with men who had been diagnosed in NYC with HIV infection through 2002 (23% of HIV-infected males did not have HIV transmission risk information available). Sexual behavior data from a cross-sectional telephone survey were used to estimate the number of sexually active MSM in NYC in 2002. Prevalence of diagnosed HIV infection was estimated using the ratio of HIV-infected MSM to sexually active MSM. The estimated base prevalence of diagnosed HIV infection was 8.4% overall (95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.5-9.6). Diagnosed HIV prevalence was highest among MSM who were non-Hispanic black (12.6%, 95% CI = 9.8-17.6), aged 35-44 (12.6%, 95% CI = 10.4-15.9), or 45-54 years (13.1%, 95% CI = 10.2-18.3), and residents of Manhattan (17.7%, 95% CI = 14.5-22.8). Overall, 37% (95% CI = 32-43%) of MSM reported using a condom at last sex, and 34% (95% CI = 28-39%) reported being tested for HIV in the past year. Estimates derived through sensitivity analyses (assigning a range of HIV-infected males with no reported risk information as MSM) yielded higher diagnosed HIV prevalence estimates (11.0-13.2%). Accounting for additional undiagnosed HIV-infected MSM yielded even higher prevalence estimates. The high prevalence of diagnosed HIV among sexually active MSM in NYC is likely due to a combination of high incidence over the course of the epidemic and prolonged survival in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Despite high HIV prevalence in this population, condom use and HIV testing are low. Combining complementary population-based data sources can provide critical HIV-related information to guide prevention efforts. Individual counseling and education interventions should focus on increasing condom use and encouraging safer sex practices among all sexually active MSM, particularly those groups with low levels of condom use and multiple sex partners."
4007,0.01,2.0000,"The signature for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) neurovirulence remains a subject of intense debate. Macrophage viral tropism is one prerequisite but others, including virus-induced alterations in innate and adaptive immunity, remain under investigation. HIV-1-infected mononuclear phagocytes (MPs; perivascular macrophages and microglia) secrete toxins that affect neurons. The authors hypothesize that neurovirulent HIV-1 variants affect the MP proteome by inducing a signature of neurotoxic proteins and thus affect cognitive function. To test this hypothesis, HIV-1 isolates obtained from peripheral blood of women with normal cognition (NC) were compared to isolates obtained from women with cognitive impairment (CI) and to the laboratory adapted SF162, a spinal fluid R5 isolate from a patient with HIV-1-associated dementia. HIV-1 isolates were used to infect monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and infection monitored by secreted HIV-1 p24 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell lysates of uninfected and HIV-1-infected MDMs at 14 days post infection were fractionated by cationic exchange chromatography and analyzed by surface enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight (SELDI-TOF) using generalized estimating equations statistics. Proteins were separated by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D SDS-PAGE) and identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Levels of viral replication were similar amongst the HIV-1 isolates, although higher levels were obtained from one viral strain obtained from a patient with CI. Significant differences were found in protein profiles between virus-infected MDMs with NC, CI, and SF162 isolates (adjusted P value after multiple testing corrections, or q value <.10). The authors identified 6 unique proteins in NC, 7 in SF162, and 20 in CI. Three proteins were common to SF162 and CI strains. The MDM proteins linked to infection with CI strains were related to apoptosis, chemotaxis, inflammation, and redox metabolism. These findings support the hypothesis that the macrophage proteome differ when infected with viral isolates of women with and without CI."
9345,0.01,2.0000,"In December 2004, infection with a strain of multidrug-resistant (MDR), dual-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 was newly diagnosed in a man aged 46 years in New York City (NYC). The man (i.e., the index patient) had no history of antiretroviral treatment and reported having sex with multiple named and anonymous male partners, using crystal methamphetamine, and engaging in unprotected insertive and receptive anal intercourse. He had rapid progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) after experiencing signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection. The case was reported to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOH) in late January 2005 and has been described previously. This report describes the public health investigation of the index patient's reported contacts and a review of viral genetic sequencing (genotype) results from other HIV-infected patients in the NYC region to estimate the prevalence of this strain of HIV. The investigation, conducted by NYCDOH, Connecticut Department of Public Health, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, New York State Department of Health, and CDC, identified three other patients with similar risk factors who engaged in high-risk sexual activity at the same time and in the same venues as the index patient and who were infected with a genotypically homologous strain of HIV. The findings demonstrate the usefulness of population-based reporting of HIV genotyping data to identify exact matches of new HIV mutations associated with drug resistance and to determine their characteristics and public health importance. The findings also demonstrate the continued risk for HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) through high-risk behaviors and the need to find effective methods to prevent HIV transmission in this population."
15032,0.01,2.0000,"Many aspects of the pathogenesis of Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) still need further elucidations. Previous studies have indicated that oxidative stress occurs during infection with the other retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). Similar results have been observed in some other chronic viral infections including hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV). In order to reveal possible oxidative stress in HTLV-1-infected patients, we evaluated serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as an indicator of oxidative stress in these patients. Forty-four HTLV-1-seropositive individuals were included in this study, consisting of 12 symptomatic and 32 asymptomatic (carrier) cases. Controls consisted of 36 apparently healthy, HTLV-1-, HIV- and hepatitis-seronegative individuals. All symptomatic patients had HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Serum TAC levels in patients and healthy individuals were measured using a quantitative TAC assay. The antioxidant capacity in HTLV-1-seropositive cases was significantly reduced compared to control group (P = 0.001). In addition, TAC was lower in patients with more than 5 years history of HAM/TSP compared to those with ≤5 years duration of the myelopathy (P = 0.03). Our results show a depletion of TAC during HTLV-1 infection, which intensifies along with the disease progress. This finding indicates a role of the oxidative stress in pathogenesis of HTLV-1. These results may prompt further research to evaluate any possible therapeutic effect of antioxidant dietary supplements for HTLV-1 infected individuals. "
14249,0.01,2.0000,"The clinical, immunologic, and virologic effects and the pharmacokinetics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) human hyperimmune immunoglobulin (HIVIG) were assessed in 30 HIV-infected children aged 2-11 years. All had moderately advanced disease with an immune complex-dissociated (ICD) p24 antigen >70 pg/mL and were on stable antiviral therapy. Three groups of 10 children received 6 monthly infusions of 200, 400, or 800 mg/kg of HIVIG, and serial immunologic and virologic assays were performed. HIVIG doses as high as 800 mg/kg were safe and well tolerated. The half-life of HIVIG, determined by serial p24 antibody titers, was 13-16 days, the volume of distribution was 102-113 mL/kg, and clearance was 5.6-6.0 mL/kg/day. Plasma ICD p24 decreased during the infusions, but CD4 cell levels, plasma RNA copy number, cellular virus, immunoglobulin levels, and neutralizing antibody titers were minimally affected by the infusions. Clinical status did not change during the 6-month infusion and 3-month follow-up periods."

Baseline plasma RNA levels and changes in RNA values at weeks 8 or 56 were more important predictors of disease progression than were baseline or changes in CD4 cell counts. Each 10-fold lower HIV RNA concentration at baseline and each 10-fold decrease in HIV RNA between baseline and week 8 was associated with increases of 49-61 CD4 cells/mm3 at weeks 56 and 104. In multivariate analyses, neither baseline values nor changes in infectious HIV titer nor ICD p24 antigen concentrations were associated with long-term changes in CD4 cell count. Plasma HIV-1 RNA appears to be the best predictor of long-term CD4 cell count responses and disease progression."
3052,0.01,2.0000,"The three direct-acting antiviral agent (3D) regimen is a novel combination of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) that has proven effective for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Given the potential for coadministration in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, possible drug interactions with antiretroviral drugs must be carefully considered. Four phase 1, multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in healthy volunteers (n = 66). The 3D regimen of 150/100 mg daily paritaprevir/ritonavir, 25 mg daily ombitasvir, and 400 mg twice-daily dasabuvir was administered alone or in combination with 200 mg daily of emtricitabine and 300 mg daily of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF), 25 mg daily of rilpivirine, or 400 mg of raltegravir twice daily. A 2-DAA regimen of 150/100 mg daily paritaprevir/ritonavir and 400 mg of dasabuvir twice daily was also studied in combination with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF at 600/200/300 mg daily, respectively (Atripla; Bristol-Myers Squibb). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from plasma drug concentrations. No clinically significant drug interactions were observed (≤32% change in exposure) between the 3D regimen and that of emtricitabine plus tenofovir DF. Raltegravir exposure was increased up to 134% when the drug was coadministered with the 3D regimen. Although coadministration with rilpivirine was well tolerated in healthy volunteers, observed elevations in rilpivirine exposures may increase the potential for adverse drug reactions. Concomitant use of the 2-DAA regimen and efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF was discontinued owing to poor tolerability and adverse events. No dose adjustment is required during coadministration of raltegravir, tenofovir DF, or emtricitabine with the 3D regimen. Rilpivirine is not recommended and efavirenz is contraindicated for coadministration with the 3D regimen."

Participants were recruited between 1985 and 1992 and followed up through 1993. Vital status was ascertained through repeat visit information, supplemented by population register data. A total of 77 deaths were recorded among 632 drug users, for a mortality rate per 1,000 person-years of 7 for HIV-negative noninjection drug users, 18 for HIV-negative injection drug users, and 64 for HIV-positive injection drug users. In multivariate analyses, limited to injection drug users, a positive HIV serostatus, age above 40 years, and using benzodiazepines several times daily were significantly associated with an elevated risk of death, both for death from all causes and for death preceding acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) diagnosis (pre-AIDS). For pre-AIDS death, the adjusted relative risk associated with HIV infection was 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.3-3.7). Only 38% of HIV-infected injection drug users who died were diagnosed with AIDS. However, 76% of HIV-infected injection drug users who died without AIDS diagnosis had evidence of immunosuppression (CD4 count < 500/microliters). Daily use of methadone and participation in needle and syringe exchange schemes were not associated with lower mortality rates. This study illustrates in a group of injection drug users with a 30% HIV seroprevalence and a high background mortality the profound influence on mortality that HIV infection has gained."
13084,0.01,2.0000,"Both hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (HBV and HCV) infection are common in HIV-infected individuals as a result of shared risk factors for acquisition. A serological study for HBV and HCV was performed in 251 HIV-positive individuals from Medellín, Colombia. A qualitative RT-PCR for HCV was done in 90 patients with CD4+ T-cell count < 150 per mm(3). Serological markers for HBV infection were present in 97 (38.6%) patients. Thirty six of them (37.1%) had isolated anti-HBc. A multivariate analysis indicated that the following risk factors were significantly associated with the presence of these markers: age (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.08), pediculosis pubis (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.01-3.33), men who have sex with men and women (OR = 3.23, 95% CI: 1.46-7.13) and men who have sex only with men (OR = 3.73, 95% CI: 1.58-8.78). The same analysis restricted to women showed syphilis as the only significant risk factor. Thus, HBV infection was considerably associated with high risk sexual behavior. HCV was present in only two (0.8%) of HIV patients. Both of them were positive by RT-PCR and anti-HCV. This low frequency of HIV/HCV coinfection was probably due to the uncommon intravenous drug abuse in this population. The frequent finding of isolated anti-HBc warrants molecular approaches to rule out the presence of cryptic HBV infection."
1616,0.01,2.0000,"The introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has sharply decreased morbidity and mortality rates among HIV infected patients. Due to this, more and more people with HIV live longer and healthier lives. Yet if they practice sex without condom, those with high viral load have the potential to infect their sero-negative sexual partner or at risk of acquiring drug resistant viral strains from their sexual partner who are already infected. Hence, we aimed to assess practice of condom use and associated factors among HIV positive clients at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital in North Western Ethiopia."
13025,0.01,2.0000,"Studies of heterosexual HIV transmission have consistently found anal intercourse to be a highly predictive risk factor for seroconversion. Yet most AIDS prevention messages targeted at heterosexuals, presumably influenced by cultural taboos against acknowledging this sexual practice, continue to emphasize vaginal and, increasingly, oral sex transmission. The health risks of anal sex appear to be severely underestimated by a substantial proportion of sexually active women and men in North and Latin America as well as parts of South Asia, Africa, and other regions. Among heterosexuals reported rates of condom use are nearly universally lower for anal than for vaginal intercourse. This review examines anal sex among the general population, including its prevalence in various world regions, related sociocultural factors, and other associated health problems including anorectal STDs, Hepatitis B infection, and HPV-related anal cancer in women. U.S. survey and other data suggest that, in terms of absolute numbers, approximately seven times more women than homosexual men engage in unprotected receptive anal intercourse. Research among higher risk subpopulations, including bisexual men, injecting drug users, female sex workers, inner-city adolescents, and serodiscordant heterosexual couples, indicates that persons particularly at risk of being infected by or transmitting HIV are also more likely to practice anal sex. Considering this finding, along with the much greater efficiency for HIV infection as well as lower rates of condom usage, a significant proportion of heterosexual transmission in some populations is due to anal intercourse. This typically stigmatized and hidden sexual practice must be given greater emphasis in AIDS/STD prevention, women's care, and other health promotion programs."
13891,0.01,2.0000,"Alcohol use is common among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this narrative review, we describe literature regarding alcohol's impact on transmission, care, coinfections, and comorbidities that are common among people living with HIV (PLWH), as well as literature regarding interventions to address alcohol use and its influences among PLWH. This narrative review identifies alcohol use as a risk factor for HIV transmission, as well as a factor impacting the clinical manifestations and management of HIV. Alcohol use appears to have additive and potentially synergistic effects on common HIV-related comorbidities. We find that interventions to modify drinking and improve HIV-related risks and outcomes have had limited success to date, and we recommend research in several areas. Consistent with Office of AIDS Research/National Institutes of Health priorities, we suggest research to better understand how and at what levels alcohol influences comorbid conditions among PLWH, to elucidate the mechanisms by which alcohol use is impacting comorbidities, and to understand whether decreases in alcohol use improve HIV-relevant outcomes. This should include studies regarding whether state-of-the-art medications used to treat common coinfections are safe for PLWH who drink alcohol. We recommend that future research among PLWH include validated self-report measures of alcohol use and/or biological measurements, ideally both. Additionally, subgroup variation in associations should be identified to ensure that the risks of particularly vulnerable populations are understood. This body of research should serve as a foundation for a next generation of intervention studies to address alcohol use from transmission to treatment of HIV. Intervention studies should inform implementation efforts to improve provision of alcohol-related interventions and treatments for PLWH in healthcare settings. By making further progress on understanding how alcohol use affects PLWH in the era of HIV as a chronic condition, this research should inform how we can mitigate transmission, achieve viral suppression, and avoid exacerbating common comorbidities of HIV and alcohol use and make progress toward the 90-90-90 goals for engagement in the HIV treatment cascade."
284,0.01,2.0000,"Chronic HCV co-infection is present in up to one third of HIV-positive patients in Europe. In recent years, apart from the traditional transmission route of intravenous drug abuse, outbreaks of sexually transmitted acute HCV infections, mainly among HIV-positive men who have sex with men, have contributed to the overall disease burden. - Because the natural course of HCV infection is substantially accelerated in HIV-co-infection, end-stage liver disease has become the most frequent cause of non-AIDS related death in this population. Therefore every HIV/HCV co-infected patient should be evaluated for possible anti-HCV therapy with the goal of reaching a sustained virological response and thus cure of hepatitis C infection. The standard of care for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in HIV-infected remains a pegylated interferon in combination with weight-adapted ribavirin. - HAART should not be withheld from HCV co-infected patients due to concerns of drug related hepatotoxicity and in patients with reduced CD4-cell counts HAART should be started first. Under pegylated interferon and ribavirin combination therapy drug to drug interactions and cumulated toxicity between nucleoside analogues and anti-HCV therapy may be observed and concomitant didanosine use is contraindicated and zidovudine and stavudine should be avoided if possible. - The development of new drugs for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C represents a promising perspective also for HIV positive patients. However, these substances will probably reach clinical routine for HIV patients later than HCV monoinfected patients. Therefore at present waiting for new drugs is not an alternative to a modern pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy."
13038,0.01,2.0000,"The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical profile of end-stage acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A cross-sectional examination of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who attended a public HIV outpatient clinic and died between 1996 and 2001 was conducted (n = 669). All clinical and demographic data were collected from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Adult Spectrum of Disease database. The prevalence of first-time acquisition of AIDS-defining conditions 12 months before death were evaluated. The prevalence of renal disease, hepatic disease and substance use were also evaluated. The majority of the patients were 35 years old or older, male, African American and HAART-experienced. The six AIDS-defining conditions with the highest percentages of first-time acquisition in the last 12 months of life were HIV dementia (91.8%), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (91.7%), wasting (90.9%), Mycobacterium avium complex infection (MAC) (80.0%), lymphoma (78.6%), and cytomegalovirus infection (CMV) (78.1%). Forty-four percent of the patients were diagnosed with at least one of these six conditions 12 months before death. More than one third of the patients had renal or hepatic failure, injecting drug use (IDU) as the HIV risk factor, and history of substance use. AIDS-defining conditions continue to have an impact on mortality, especially the neurologic conditions and wasting. However, other conditions, such as renal and hepatic disease, are becoming important causes of mortality because the HIV-infected population now includes more drug users, and HIV-infected patients are surviving for longer periods. These results should help clinicians better time the discussion of end-stage options and improve the patient's quality of life."
11814,0.01,2.0000,"Loss of periodontal support and eventually tooth loss is a common finding among acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. The cause of this destruction may be an increase in periodontal disease activity at sites within the same individual and also may be related to an increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines, diffused through the gingival crevicular sulcus in AIDS patients. A study was undertaken to determine the relative levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), in gingival crevicular fluid collected from the deep (> 5 mm periodontal pocket depth) and shallow (< or = 3 mm periodontal pocket depth) periodontal pockets of 39 HIV-1-infected patients and 20 age-, race- and sex-matched uninfected controls. Complete medical history including risk factors such as intravenous drug abuse was taken. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected on periopaper strips. Cytokines were estimated by solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To assess the degree of HIV activity, the viral load of these patients was determined by an Amplicor HIV-1 monitor kit using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Gingival crevicular fluid from HIV-1-infected patients showed a two-fold increase in both IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in deep periodontal pockets in comparison to shallow pockets, whereas IL-6 increased 1.8-fold. There was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in gingival crevicular fluid (both shallow and deep pockets) from HIV-1-infected patients in comparison to uninfected controls and also significantly elevated in deep versus shallow pockets in these patients. Although IL-1 beta, L-6 and TNF-alpha levels among HIV-1-infected patients with a high viral load (> 10,000 copies/ml) were higher than those from patients with a low viral load (< 400 copies/ml), only the increase in IL-1 beta level associated with deep pockets was significant (P < 0.05). There was also a trend of an increase in all the three cytokines among intravenous drug-abusing HIV-1-infected patients in comparison to non-intravenous drug abusers, but only the difference in IL-1 beta levels from deep pockets reached significance (P < 0.05). These enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the gingival crevicular fluid of HIV-positive patients may be an important factor in causing the advanced periodontal lesions sometimes observed in HIV-positive patients."
1530,0.01,2.0000,"HBsAg clearance is associated with clinical cure of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Quantification of HBsAg may help to predict HBsAg clearance during the natural course of HBV infection and during antiviral therapy. Most studies investigating quantitative HBsAg were performed in HBV mono-infected patients. However, the immune status is considered to be important for HBsAg decline and subsequent HBsAg loss. HIV co-infection unfavorably influences the course of chronic hepatitis B. In this cross-sectional study we investigated quantitative HBsAg in 173 HBV/HIV co-infected patients from 6 centers and evaluated the importance of immunodeficiency and antiretroviral therapy. We also compared 46 untreated HIV/HBV infected patients with 46 well-matched HBV mono-infected patients. HBsAg levels correlated with CD4 T-cell count and were higher in patients with more advanced HIV CDC stage. Patients on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including nucleos(t)ide analogues active against HBV demonstrated significant lower HBsAg levels compared to untreated patients. Importantly, HBsAg levels were significantly lower in patients who had a stronger increase between nadir CD4 and current CD4 T-cell count during cART. Untreated HIV/HBV patients demonstrated higher HBsAg levels than HBV mono-infected patients despite similar HBV DNA levels. In conclusion, HBsAg decline is dependent on an effective immune status. Restoration of CD4 T-cells during treatment with cART including nucleos(t)ide analogues seems to be important for HBsAg decrease and subsequent HBsAg loss."
13899,0.01,2.0000,"An increasing trend in sexual risk behavior has occurred in the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Thailand. This study was conducted to identify sexual risk behavior and examine relationships between unprotected sex and CD4 levels among HIV-infected patients receiving ART in the National Antiretroviral Program. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 460 HIV-infected patients age 18-49 years who visited the out-patient clinic of Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute in February 2006 by using a standardized self-administered questionnaire. The results show that 60.4% of participants were men. The median most recent CD4 cell count during the prior 6 months was 261 cells/mm3. Twenty-three percent of the participants who had no sexual activity after they knew their HIV positive status started having sex again after receiving ART with a 12-week median duration period from starting ART to having first sex. There was a significant difference between the number of those having sexual activity before and after starting ART (p-value=0.013). Fifty-six percent of participants had sex during the previous 6 months. Of these, 26.5% had sex with commercial partners and 28.4% with non-regular partners. Inconsistent condom use, with commercial partners or non-regular partners, in females (35.3-36.8%) was higher than in males (7.8-11.1%). Participants with a known HIV-negative regular partner were 0.25 times more likely to have unprotected sex than those with a known HIV-positive regular partner (adjusted OR, 0.25; 95%CI, 0.09-0.73). No association between unprotected sex and CD4 levels was found. The findings support the need for reinforcing risk reduction programs among HIV-infected persons, particularly couple counseling, and promoting awareness of risk of acquirring sexually transmitted infections and drug-resistant strains of HIV."
3935,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 invades the central nervous system (CNS) soon after infection and is partially protected there from host immunity and antiretroviral drugs (ARVs). Sanctuary from highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the CNS could result in ongoing viral replication, promoting the development of drug resistance and neurological disease. Despite the importance of these risks, no previous study has directly assessed HAART's effects on brain tissue viral load (VL). The authors evaluated 61 HIV-infected individuals for whom both histories of HAART treatment and postmortem brain tissue VL measurements were available. Two groups were defined based on HAART use in the 3 months prior to death: HAART(+) subjects had received HAART, and HAART(-) subjects had not received HAART. HIV RNA was quantified in postmortem brain tissue (log10 copies/10 microg total tissue RNA) and antemortem plasma (log10 copies/ml) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Brain tissue VLs were significantly lower among HAART(+) subjects compared to HAART(-) subjects (median 2.6 versus 4.1; P= .0007). These findings suggest that despite the limited CNS penetration of many antiretroviral medications, HAART is at least partially effective in suppressing CNS viral replication. Because some HAART regimens may be better than others in this regard, regimen selection strategies could be used to impede CNS viral activity, limit neuronal dysfunction, and prevent or treat clinical neurocognitive disorders in HIV-infected patients. Furthermore, such strategies might help to prevent the development of ARV resistance."
11622,0.01,2.0000,"Recent studies have documented dramatic decreases in opportunistic infections, hospitalizations, and mortality among HIV-infected persons, owing primarily to the advent of highly active antiretroviral medications. Unfortunately, not all segments of the population living with HIV benefit equally from treatment. In San Francisco, only about 30% of the HIV-infected urban poor take combination highly active antiretroviral medications, as compared with 88% of HIV-infected gay men. Practitioners who care for the urban poor are reluctant to prescribe these medications, fearing inadequate or inconsistent adherence to the complicated medical regimen. Persons typically must take 2 to 15 pills at a time, 2 to 3 times a day. Some of the medications require refrigeration, which may not be available to the homeless poor. Most homeless persons do not have food available to them on a consistent schedule. Therefore, they may have difficulty adhering to instructions to take medications only on an empty stomach or with food. Lack of a safe place to store medications may be an issue for some. In addition, many urban poor live with drug, alcohol, or mental health problems, which can interfere with taking medications as prescribed. Inconsistent adherence to medication regimens has serious consequences. Patients do not benefit fully from treatments, and they will become resistant to the medications in their regimen as well as to other medications in the same classes as those in their regimen. Development of resistance has implications for the broader public health, because inadvertent transmission of multidrug-resistant strains of HIV has been demonstrated. Concern that the urban poor will not adhere to highly active antiretroviral medication regimens has led to debate on the role of clinicians and public health officials in determining who can comply with these regimens. Rather than define the characteristics that would predict adherence to these regimens, the San Francisco Department of Public Health created a program to support adherence among those who may have the greatest difficulty complying with complicated highly active antiretroviral medication regimens. The program, dubbed the Action Point Adherence Project, was conceived through a community planning process in preparation for a city-wide summit on HIV/AIDS that took place in January 1998. Action Point is funded by the city and the county of San Francisco. Now in its 10th month, the program continues to show promising evidence of improving clients' biological and social indicators."
9473,0.01,2.0000,"The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and genetic variability of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among 205 patients with clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in Buenos Aires in 2001. Infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV), HIV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV), Treponema pallidum and human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I/II were diagnosed in 37/187 (19.8 %), 35/205 (17.1 %), 22/187 (11.8 %), 13/187 (7.0 %) and 4/181 (2.2 %) patients, respectively. Almost one in three participants (33.1 %) presented at least one infection in addition to TB. Multiresistance to TB drugs (isoniazid plus rifampicin) was detected in the isolates recovered from three patients. Injecting drug use was detected as the main risk factor for HIV, HBV and HCV infections. Of ten patients who died, eight were infected with HIV. HIV genetic characterization showed the presence of two different subtypes. Env subtype F was found in 13/24 samples (54.2 %) and subtype B in 11/24 samples (45.8 %) by heteroduplex mobility assay. Sequencing of the protease/RT region was performed in ten samples: three were characterized as subtype B and seven as B/F recombinants by bootscanning analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of four full-length sequences showed that three were the circulating recombinant form CRF12_BF. The results of this study suggest an urgent need to detect HIV infection in high-risk groups to prevent future HIV transmission as well as morbidity and mortality associated with TB by providing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and/or TB treatment. Collaboration between TB and HIV programmes seems to be the best approach to decrease the incidence of these diseases, especially in high-prevalence HIV settings."
2304,0.01,2.0000,"Acute hepatitis C continues to be a concern in men who have sex with men (MSM), and its optimal management has yet to be established. In this study, the clinical, biological, and therapeutic data of 53 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected MSM included in a multicenter prospective study on acute hepatitis C in 2006-2007 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. The mean hepatitis C virus (HCV) viral load at diagnosis was 5.8 ± 1.1 log(10) IU/mL (genotype 4, n = 28; genotype 1, n = 14, genotype 3, n = 7). The cumulative rates of spontaneous HCV clearance were 11.0% and 16.5% 3 and 6 months after diagnosis, respectively. Forty patients were treated, 38 of whom received pegylated interferon and ribavirin. The mean duration of HCV therapy was 39 ± 17 weeks (24 ± 4 weeks in 14 cases). On treatment, 18/36 (50.0%; 95% confidence interval 34.3-65.7) patients had undetectable HCV RNA at week 4 (RVR), and 32/39 (82.1%; 95 confidence interval 70.0-94.1) achieved sustained virological response (SVR). SVR did not correlate with pretreatment parameters, including HCV genotype, but correlated with RVR (predictive positive value of 94.4%) and with effective duration of HCV therapy (64.3% for 24 ± 4 weeks versus 92.0% for longer treatment; P = 0.03)."
12554,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection modifies the natural history of chronic hepatitis C, thus promoting more rapid progression to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. The objective of our study was to determine whether hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients positive for HIV and HCV. It was an ambispective cohort study carried out in 11 HIV units in Spain and involved 711 consecutive patients positive for HIV/HCV who started interferon plus ribavirin therapy between 2000 and 2005. We measured sustained virologic response (SVR), i.e., undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks after the end of treatment, and clinical outcomes, defined as death (liver-related or non-liver-related), liver decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation. Of 711 patients who were positive for HIV/HCV, 31% had SVR. During a mean follow-up of 20.8 months (interquartile range: 12.2-38.7), the incidence rates per 100 person-years of overall mortality, liver-related mortality, and liver decompensation were 0.46, 0.23, and 0.23 among patients with SVR and 3.12, 1.65, and 4.33 among those without SVR (P = 0.003, 0.028, and <0.001 by the log-rank test), respectively. Cox regression analysis adjusted for fibrosis, HCV genotype, HCV RNA viral load, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clinical category, and nadir CD4+ cell count showed that the adjusted hazard ratio of liver-related events was 8.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.20; 66.11, P = 0.032) for nonresponders in comparison with responders and 4.96 (95% confidence interval, 2.27; 10.85, P < 0.001) for patients with fibrosis grade of F3-F4 versus those with F0-F2.Because this was not a prospective study, selection and survival biases may influence estimates of effect."
8234,0.01,2.0000,"Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is an effective treatment for HIV, many physicians withhold this treatment from HIV-positive injecting drug users (IDUs) because of fears of non-adherence and consequent development of antiretroviral resistance. Little is known, however, about whether the rates of resistance differ between IDUs and non-IDUs. We did a meta-analysis of studies that compared antiretroviral resistance rates in IDUs (current or previous) with those in HIV-positive patients infected by other routes and who had never injected drugs. We used a random-effects model to investigate overall resistance rates and resistance to individual drug classes. Of 181 potential studies, 27 were eligible for review. We were able to extract data from 14 studies, but two were excluded because of a very small sample size of IDUs or data being available only from a secondary analysis. Thus we included 12 studies in the meta-analysis, involving 9055 patients, of which 2054 (23%) were IDUs. The risk of development of antiretroviral resistance did not differ significantly between IDU and non-IDU (odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.74-1.45, p=0.84). Rates of loss to follow-up and virological failure were similar in IDU and non-IDU samples. Existing evidence does not support the common practice of withholding antiretroviral therapy from HIV-positive IDU on the basis of an elevated risk of antiretroviral resistance. Therapeutic guidelines should consider reassessment of this issue."
19842,0.01,2.0000,"AIDS-related mortality and the rate of progression to AIDS have dramatically decreased since the advent of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART). The overall benefit from antiretroviral HIV treatment has, however, been lesser in HIV-infected injecting drug users (IDUs) than in other patient groups (e.g. men who have sex with men). Poorer outcomes in HIV-infected IDUs are related to a variety of factors, including increased rates of non-HIV-related deaths, hepatitis C, delayed access to effective treatment, lower adherence to care and treatment regimens, continuation of illicit drug use, depression and negative life events. The available evidence strongly suggests the need for the large-scale implementation of comprehensive treatment and care strategies for IDUs that include both treatment of drug dependence and HAART."
3660,0.01,2.0000,"Studies of HIV-positive patients have consistently shown that drug users, in particular injection drug users (IDU), are far more likely to have hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection than other patient groups. HIV incidence and prevalence in IDU has declined in recent years, but HCV remains endemic in this population. HCV antibody prevalence among non-injection users of drugs such as heroin and cocaine is between 5 and 30%, although there are scant data on specific transmission risk behavior. The control of HIV/HCV co-infection must address HCV prevention. Epidemiological studies have suggested that HCV prevalence in IDU is subject to various influences, some of which may be modifiable by interventions. However, studies have not shown consistent effects of various prevention strategies on HCV transmission, including studies of HCV screening and education, drug treatment or needle exchange. Although some large cross-sectional studies in regions where needle exchange is available to a large number of drug injectors have reported declining HCV prevalence, the scale of services needed is a matter of considerable debate and has not been systematically quantified. Priorities for research related to the prevention of HIV/HCV co-infection should include estimating the effect on disease occurrence of eliminating specific risk factors, and specifying the level of resources needed to alter HCV incidence."
3683,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation is the frequent complication after cytotoxic chemotherapy in HBsAg-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients. Pre-chemotherapy viral load may be a risk factor and HBeAg-positive status is associated with increased viral load. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term treatment outcome of lamivudine in preventing HBV reactivation and its associated morbidity according to HBeAg status. Twenty-four adult HBsAg-positive NHL patients were taken 100 mg of lamivudine daily before the initiation of chemotherapy. The median duration of lamivudine therapy was 11.5 months (range: 1-54 months) and the median number of chemotherapy cycles was 6 (range: 1-16 cycles). The steroid containing chemotherapy regimens were used in 18 patients (75%), and the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody containing chemotherapy regimen was used in 6 patients (25%). Four patients received autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation without resultant HBV reactivation. Hepatitis related to HBV reactivation was developed in 1 patient among 14 HBeAg-positive patients and no one among 10 HBeAg-negative. One patient developed HBV reactivation after lamivudine withdrawal, and 4 patients developed the YMDD (tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate) mutation during lamivudine therapy. There were no statistical differences in HBV reactivation rate during chemotherapy according to the HBeAg status. Our results demonstrate that lamivudine should be considered preemptively before the chemotherapy for all HBsAg-positive NHL patients to prevent HBV reactivation, regardless of pre-chemotherapy HBeAg status. Finally, compared with the chronic hepatitis B patients, similar rate of HBV reactivation after lamivudine withdrawal and development of YMDD mutation was observed in NHL patients."
9198,0.01,2.0000,"This article reports on the sexual life of HIV-positive heterosexual men and women in a stable relationship and on successful antiretroviral therapy in Thailand. We focused on one side on their sexual practices and options for contraception, and on the other on their intention for conception and factors influencing it, in the time of highly active antiretroviral therapy. In a cross-sectional study, 200 participants completed a questionnaire. Eleven female participants took part in focus group discussions (FGD), based on their intention for conception. We used descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and Chi-square exact test to present the results from the questionnaire, and a narrative approach for the FGD results. The median age of the participants was 37 years. Almost all were sexually active (88%) and rarely engaged in risky sexual behavior. The most common method of contraception for women was the male condom (95%), followed by female sterilization (40%). Almost all men reported consistent condom use. One-third of the main sexual partners were HIV-negative. The intention for conception was significantly less after being diagnosed with HIV (29% intended pregnancies after HIV diagnosis vs. 72% before HIV diagnosis). Nevertheless, 25% of the participants expressed a desire to have a child. We found a significant positive association between the intention for conception and less years of being married, the lower number of children and the higher levels of education. Therefore, we conclude that HIV-positive men and women are sexually active and in need of comprehensive reproductive health care services including counseling on safe ways to conceive and offering a diverse choice of contraceptive methods to those who do not wish to have children."
13576,0.01,2.0000,"Symptom management in HIV/AIDS is a critical issue that influences the quality of life of those living with the disease. Although the goals of treating the numbers living with HIV/AIDS have not yet been achieved, availability of antiretroviral therapies (ARVs) has been expanded to many clinical settings in KwaZulu-Natal, the epicenter of HIV infection in South Africa. The South African Department of Health (2007) estimates indicate that 5.54 million South Africans are living with HIV/AIDS, whereas UNAIDS (2007) estimates suggest that 18.8% of the population in South Africa is affected. Because the symptom experience may influence adherence to ARVs and quality of life, this study focused on the prevalence of symptoms reported by patients (N = 149) diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and adherence to medications and appointments. Self-report data were obtained from this community-based sample of HIV-infected patients who received care in outpatient clinics in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. With an average of three side effects, the most frequently reported by the study participants were fatigue/tiredness (41%), rashes (40%), headaches (32%), insomnia (31%), sadness (24%), disturbing dreams (23%), numbness (22%), pain (22%), and self-appearance (20%). On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being worst possible), those with symptoms reported an average intensity of 4.2 (SD = 2.0), and the degree to which symptoms affected activity levels was 3.2 (SD = 2.2). Although intensity of symptoms and effects on activity levels were strongly correlated (r = .78, p < .001), there were no significant relationships between adherence and the intensity of symptoms or the relationship of symptoms with activity levels. Logistic regression analyses indicate that the presence of a greater number of symptoms was not associated with greater adherence (odds ratio = 2.27, 95% confidence interval = 0.60-8.70, ns). However, those who reported higher adherence were 1.5 times more likely to report greater physical health than low adherers (p = .04). High adherers were also 1.6 times more likely to report greater psychological health than low adherers (p = .03). This suggests that further study is needed to investigate adherence motivations for those living with HIV/AIDS in South Africa because adherence seems not to be linked to the frequency of symptoms or limitations on activity related to symptoms."
1786,0.01,2.0000,"We examined the replicative properties of a series of sequential isolates and biological clones of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) obtained from an individual who progressed from seroconversion to AIDS in approximately 5 years. HIV-1 isolated soon after seroconversion replicated slowly and to low levels in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells; however, subsequent isolates obtained during asymptomatic infection showed a marked increase in replication kinetics. This was examined in more detail by using a panel of 35 biological clones of HIV-1 generated from sequential patient peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples. Each clone was evaluated for replication in primary macrophages and CD4+ T lymphocytes and for the ability to induce syncytium formation in MT-2 cell cultures. Consistent with earlier observations, we found that all of the clones isolated just after seroconversion were slowly replicating and non-syncytium inducing (NSI). However, NSI variants with increased replication kinetics in macrophages were identified soon thereafter. These variants preceded the appearance of NSI and syncytium-inducing variants, with rapid replication in both macrophages and CD4+ T lymphocytes. To determine whether changes in the rate of replication could be traced to the early stages of the virus life cycle, PCR assays were used to evaluate entry and reverse transcription of selected biological clones in macrophages and CD4+ T lymphocytes. We found there was no inherent block to entry or reverse transcription for the slowly replicating variants; however, this does not preclude the possibility that small differences in the rate of entry may account for larger differences in the replication kinetics over many cycles. Overall, our results demonstrate that rapidly replicating variants of HIV-1 emerge during the asymptomatic period in a patient who subsequently progressed clinically, suggesting that these variants may play an important role in HIV-1 pathogenesis."
9257,0.01,2.0000,"Although prolactin (PRL) is now recognized as a cytokine and persistent immune activation is a common immunopathogenic feature of the human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV), the circumstances associated with the onset of hyperprolactinemia during the course of this infection remain controversial. Given that PRL is able to exert not only endocrinologic effects but also immunologic influences, a study was conducted to investigate whether raised serum levels of PRL were more likely to prevail when HIV-infected patients developed concomitant infections. Serum PRL concentrations, as well as immunoglobulin isotypes, plasmatic viral burden, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, and natural killer (NK) cell counts were measured in 46 nonselected HIV-infected patients stratified on the basis of the presence or absence of clinically active concomitant infections. Serum PRL levels were significantly higher in patients presenting secondary infections as compared with the asymptomatic ones, with hyperprolactinemia being detected in 10/18 (55%) and 2/28 (7%) of these patient groups, respectively. Hyperprolactinemia was not related with viral burden, antiretroviral treatment, gender differences, or CD4+ cell counts. CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ cells were significantly lower in the group presenting active infections, whereas comparisons in NK cell counts, immunoglobulin levels and HIV viral burden revealed no differences between groups. These results provide evidence that hyperprolactinemia is more prevalent during the onset of secondary infections, which might have diagnostic and therapeutic consequences."
3142,0.01,2.0000,"Advances in HIV treatment have generated optimistic beliefs about HIV transmission risk and sexually transmitted infection vulnerability, which can influence motivation to practice safer sex. This study sought to better understand the relationships between these beliefs and different types of sexual risk behavior. A second objective was to determine the association between treatment adherence and sexual risk behaviors. Data collected from 842 HIV-positive men who have sex with men on treatment were examined. Eleven questions measured beliefs regarding HIV transmission risk and vulnerability to other infections or negative health outcomes. The main outcomes were concordant and discordant unprotected anal sex with main and non-main male partners. Thirty-four percent reported concordant and 41% reported discordant unprotected anal sex in the past three months: 26% reported discordant insertive unprotected anal sex. In all multivariate logistic regression models predicting sexual risk behaviors, at least one belief item remained statistically significant. Different patterns of associations between beliefs and sexual risk were observed across partner type and serostatus. Compared to transmission risk beliefs, more vulnerability beliefs were associated with sexual risk. Missing at least one treatment dose in the past month was associated with concordant and discordant sexual risk with non-main partners, while intentionally missing a dose was associated with only discordant risk with non-main partners. Post hoc moderator analysis explored potential interaction between beliefs and adherence. The belief that a low viral load lowers transmission risk was positively associated with discordant sex with non-main partners only among those who missed a dose intentionally. These results underscore the complex relationship between HIV transmission risk and vulnerability beliefs and sexual behavior with different types of partners. Prevention programs should carefully consider how to craft and tailor messages about medical advances while at the same time reinforcing the need for continued sexual safety."
10097,0.01,2.0000,"The synthetic peptide T-20 (enfuvirtide) represents the first of a new class of antiretroviral compounds to demonstrate in vivo potency by targeting a step in viral entry. T-20 inhibits a conformational change in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) that is required for fusion between HIV-1 and target cell membranes. The initial phase I clinical trial of T-20 treatment for HIV-infected patients thus provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the emergence of resistant virus in vivo to this novel class of antiretroviral agents. All four patients who received an intermediate dose of T-20 (30 mg twice daily) had an initial decline in plasma viral load over the first 10 days but a rising trend by day 14, suggestive of selection for resistant virus. Plasma virus derived from patients enrolled in all dosage groups of the phase I T-20 trial was analyzed by population sequencing before and after treatment. While no mutations were found within a highly conserved 3-amino-acid sequence (GIV) known to be critical for fusion at baseline, after 14 days of therapy, virus from one patient in the 30-mg dose group (30-1) developed a mutation in this motif, specifically an aspartic acid (D) substitution for glycine (G) at position 36. Multiple env clones were derived from the plasma virus of all four patients in the 30-mg dosage group. Sequence analysis of 49 clones derived from the plasma of patient 30-1 on day 14 revealed that 25 clones contained the G36D mutation, while 8 contained the V38A mutation. Dual mutations involving G36D and other residues within the HR1 domain were also identified. In 5 of the 49 env clones, other mutations involving residues 32 (Q32R or Q32H) and 39 (Q39R) were found in combination with G36D. Cloned env sequences derived from the plasma virus of subject 30-3 also had single mutations in the GIV sequence (V38M and I37V) detectable following therapy with T-20. The plasma virus from subjects 30-2 and 30-4 did not contain changes within the GIV sequence. To analyze the biological resistance properties of these mutations, we developed a novel single-cycle HIV-1 entry assay using JC53BL cells which express beta-galactosidase and luciferase under control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. Full-length env clones were derived from the plasma virus of patients 30-1 and 30-3 and used to generate pseudotyped virus stocks. The mean 50% inhibition concentrations (IC(50)s) for mutants G36D and V38A (patient 30-1) were 2.3 microg/ml and 11.2 microg/ml, respectively, statistically significant increases of 9.1- and 45-fold, respectively, compared with those of wild-type Env. The IC(50) for the V38 M mutation (patient 30-3) was 7.6 microg/ml, an 8-fold increase compared with that of the wild type. The I37V mutation resulted in an IC(50) 3.2-fold greater than that of the wild type. Envs with double mutations (Q32R plus G36D and Q32H plus G36D) exhibited a level of resistance similar to that of G36D alone. These findings provide the first evidence for the rapid emergence of clinical resistance to a novel class of HIV-1 entry inhibitors and may be relevant to future treatment strategies involving these agents."
3869,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related stigma among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) has been associated with adverse health outcomes, including poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy and care, and increased participation in behaviors linked to higher rates of HIV transmission. In China, the incidence of HIV is growing more rapidly among MSM than among other subgroups. This study characterizes and quantifies HIV stigma among HIV-infected MSM in Beijing, China, which arguably may be driving this epidemic. A cross-sectional survey study was performed among 266 HIV-positive MSM in Beijing, China, in 2014. The Berger HIV Stigma Scale was used to measure levels of HIV-related stigma. Participants additionally answered questions regarding socio-demographic characteristics and HIV-associated risk factors; previously validated Mandarin-language scales assessed depression, coping style, and social support networks. Multivariable linear regression models were used to identify variables significantly associated with HIV stigma. The mean overall HIV stigma score among the study population was 112.78 ± 18.11 (score range: 40-160). Higher HIV stigma scores were positively associated with depression (β = 7.99, 95% CI:3.69, 12.29, p < .001) and negative coping skills (β = 0.64, 95% CI:0.21,1.08, p < .01), and was negatively associated with disclosed HIV status (β = -6.45, 95%CI:-11.80, -1.11, p < .05), and availability of social support networks (β = -0.12, 95%CI:-0.22, -0.02, p < .05). Other variables such as poor self-rated health status and presence of opportunistic infections were positively associated with individual dimensions of HIV-related stigma. The results of this study can inform the development of culturally sensitive interventions to reduce HIV-related stigma among MSM with HIV in China, with the overarching goal of reducing HIV transmission in this vulnerable population."
8778,0.005,1.0000,"Risk association studies of late postnatal outcomes for children breastfed by HIV-1 positive mothers have had inconsistent findings and have not explored interactions among risk factors. This study addresses these limitations through an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of HIV-free survival outcomes of nine randomized controlled trials to prevent early mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. The pooled sample consisted of 3,324 African children in resource-limited settings who survived to age 28 days and were at-risk of acquiring HIV through breast milk. Based on a proportional hazards mixed effects meta-analysis, the composite endpoint of HIV-1 infection and all-cause mortality was found to be significantly associated with maternal immune status (CD4(+) ≥350 cells/mm(3), HR 0.59 95% CI (0.39, 0.87)), infant preterm delivery (gestational age <37 weeks, 1.40 (1.03, 1.89)), infant oral candidiasis infection (1.87, (1.53, 2.29)), and occurrence of breast abnormality before breastfeeding cessation (2.56 (1.90, 3.46)). A significant interaction between mother's parity (any previous pregnancy) and CD4(+) count ≥350 (HR 0.63 (0.40, 0.99), P-value = 0.045) suggested that higher CD4(+) count offsets the risk associated with higher parity. Further research is needed to elucidate the moderating effect of immune status on the risk associated with high parity and adverse late postnatal outcomes for infants breastfed by HIV-infected mothers in the absence of antiretroviral treatment."
2308,0.005,1.0000,"While combination antiretroviral treatment has had a profound impact on the morbidity and mortality of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the adherence demands of this therapy are high and failure to maintain viral suppression is common. Directly administered antiretroviral therapy (DAART) has garnered attention recently as a strategy to improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes in HIV-infected individuals. This review is intended to provide an update on the use of DAART and the challenges posed by this strategy, explore settings in which DAART may be used, discuss the role of antiretroviral regimens with improved pharmacokinetic features, and propose future directions for DAART strategies. DAART is modeled on directly observed therapy (DOT) for the treatment of tuberculosis. However, differences in curability, medication dosing frequency, duration of treatment, and the biologic dynamics of infection, pose unique challenges to DAART strategies. Numerous settings have been proposed for DAART, including community based outreach programs, prisons, long-term care facilities, substance abuse treatment sites, and resource-poor countries. Experience with DAART to date has been limited to pilot studies or retrospective comparisons. The prospect of simplified, once-daily antiretroviral therapy holds promise for DAART. However, improvements in antiretroviral therapy may also improve outcomes in patients taking therapy on a self-administered basis. Randomized controlled trials of DAART are needed before this strategy can be embraced in any setting. In future studies it will be important to compare DAART with self-administered therapy in terms of initial virologic and immunologic responses, durability of responses, the development of antiretroviral resistance, and cost effectiveness."
11810,0.005,1.0000,"In a background of very high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among women of childbearing age and the increasing demand for treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission, we investigated the desire for a future pregnancy among women in Zimbabwe in relation to (1) self-perceived risk of HIV infection, (2) child mortality, and (3) spontaneous abortion. A random cross-sectional sample of 2250 ever-married women aged 15-49 years was selected from 6,828 households in rural and urban Zimbabwe. The sample was representative of the geographic distribution of women. One eligible subject was selected per household for a structured interview on factors associated with the desire for future pregnancy. Overall, 54% of the participants desired to get pregnant in future; 55% perceived themselves at high risk for HIV infection; 6% reported the death of at least one child less than the age of 5 years in the last 5 years; and 12% reported at least one spontaneous abortion in the last 5 years. In multiple logistic regression analysis, reporting at least one child's death (OR = 1.77; 95% CI 1.13-2.78) and at least one spontaneous abortion in the last 5 years (OR = 1.81; 95% CI 1.08-3.04) were significantly associated with a higher desire to get pregnant; however, high self-perceived risk for HIV infection was not (OR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.67-1.09). High self-perceived risk for infection with HIV was not associated with a lower desire for a future pregnancy among women in Zimbabwe in a high-prevalence area. In fact, our data suggest an increased desire for future pregnancy to replace childhood deaths or spontaneous abortions that may result from HIV infection. Voluntary HIV testing services are challenged with balancing counseling messages on the strong desire for children, the risk of mother-to-child transmission, and poor fetal outcomes. Further research is needed to explore utilitarian-economic, social, and psychological values attributed to children by women and their partners. The involvement of men as partners in childbearing should be explored, as their desire for children may be the primary barrier to protective behavior change among women."
1003,0.005,1.0000,"The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the combination of at least three different antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, has greatly improved the prognosis for HIV-1-infected patients. The efficacy of a combination of a protease inhibitor (PI) plus two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been well established over a period of up to 3 years. However, virological treatment failure has been reported in 40-60% of unselected patients within 1 year after initiation of a PI-containing regimen. This observation may, at least in part, be attributed to the poor pharmacokinetic characteristics of the PIs. Given as a single agent the PIs have several pharmacokinetic limitations; relatively short plasma-elimination half-lives and a modest and variable oral bioavailability, which is, for some of the PIs, influenced by food. To overcome these suboptimal pharmacokinetics, high doses (requiring large numbers of pills) must be ingested, often with food restrictions, which complicates patient adherence to the prescribed regimen. Positive drug-drug interactions increase the exposure to the PIs, allowing administration of lower doses at reduced dosing frequencies with less dietary restrictions. In addition to increasing the potency of an antiretroviral regimen, combinations of PIs may enhance patient adherence, both of which will contribute to a more durable suppression of viral replication. The favourable pharmacokinetics of PIs in combination are a result of interactions through cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzymes and, possibly, the multi-drug transporting P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Antiretroviral synergy between PIs and non-overlapping primary resistance patterns in the HIV-1 protease genome may further enhance the antiretroviral potency and durability of combinations of PIs. Many combinations contain ritonavir because this PI has the most pronounced inhibiting effects on CYP3A4. The combination of saquinavir and ritonavir, both in a dose of 400 mg twice-a-day, is the most studied double PI combination, with clinical experience extending over 3 years. Combination of a PI with a low dose of ritonavir (< or = 400 mg/day), only to boost its pharmacokinetic properties, seems an attractive option for patients who cannot tolerate higher doses of ritonavir. A recently introduced PI, lopinavir, has been co-formulated with low-dose ritonavir, which allows for a convenient three-capsules, twice-a-day dosing regimen. In an attempt to prolong suppression of viral replication combinations of PIs are becoming increasingly popular. However, further clinical studies are needed to identify the optimal combinations for treatment of antiretroviral naive and experienced HIV-1-infected patients. This review covers combinations of saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir and lopinavir with different doses of ritonavir, as well as the combinations of saquinavir and indinavir with nelfinavir."
900,0.005,1.0000,"This paper presents the first of a three-phase study exploring the experiences of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Northern Thailand. The principal aim of the study was to gain an in-depth understanding of the factors contributing to adherence in patients taking highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). These insights were used in phase two to inform a number of interventions aimed at improving medication adherence in patients commencing HAART for the first time. The study comprised a cohort of 32 PLWHA over the age of 18 years who had taken HAART for at least three months. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used. The qualitative component used a multiple case study approach to explore and describe the experiences of patients receiving HAART. The quantitative component comprised the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale and a demographic survey of the respondents. This demographic data were used to provide descriptive statistics of the research population and assist with the interpretation of the qualitative data. The findings identified a number of social, clinical, and economic factors influencing adherence to HAART. These findings led to a number of recommendations that health care providers and policy-makers can implement to improve medication adherence rates in patients taking HAART. The findings demonstrated that improved adherence not only led to improved clinical outcomes, but also the overall quality of life of PLWHA."
13733,0.005,1.0000,"To report long-term outcomes and toxicity rates after chemotherapy (CHT) followed by radiotherapy (RT) in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients with head and neck diffuse large B cell lymphomas (HN-DLBCL). Clinical data concerning consecutive HIV patients treated for DLBCL located in head and neck region with CHT and RT were retrospectively reviewed. Systemic treatment consisted of combination CHT agents given with concomitant HAART and regimen was left to oncologists' discretion. Involved field RT was delivered at a total dose of 30-36 Gy (2 Gy per fraction). Survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was evaluated using National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Overall, 13 patients were included. There were no missing data. Eight patients had advanced disease (stage III-IV = 8; 61.5%). The most common primary tumor location was oral cavity (n = 7) with large mass at presentation. All patients completed the programmed treatment. Severe acute toxicity was observed in one patient, only. Overall, three patients had died and no treatment-related deaths occurred. After a median follow-up of 152 months, the 20-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 65.9 and 41.5%, respectively. Globally, there were no RT-related late complications. This data analysis suggested that CHT followed by RT can be safety proposed in the management of patients with HIV-related HN-DLBCL in the HAART era. Further investigations are necessary to validate our results."
2670,0.005,1.0000,"Demographic information and laboratory test results on 136 169 clinical serum specimens submitted to the public health laboratory in Manitoba, Canada, for hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing between January 1995 and December 2003 were analyzed. The difference in the clearance rates of HCV infection, without therapeutic intervention, and the HCV genotypes infecting First Nation and non-First Nation people were studied. The rates of co-infection of HCV-positive individuals with other hepatitis viruses were also compared between the two study groups. The results of the analyses of the data indicated that there was a 4.4-fold increase in the number of specimens tested and a 4.9-fold decrease in HCV antibody (anti-HCV) positive cases during the study period. The proportion of specimens submitted for testing from First Nation individuals was lower than their proportion in the Manitoba population. Our study also indicated that there was a significantly higher proportion of First Nation patients who had self-limiting infection (patients cleared the infection and became HCV RNA negative without anti-HCV treatment) in comparison to non-First Nation patients. The proportion of First Nation females who had self-limiting infection was significantly higher than non-First Nation females. HCV genotype 1 infection represented more than 60% of HCV infection in Manitoba. The rate of individuals positive for the hepatitis A virus antibody in the HCV-positive population was higher among First Nation than non-First Nation individuals. On the other hand, there were more HCV-infected First Nation patients than non-First Nation patients who were not immune to the hepatitis B virus. The data indicate that fewer First Nation patients seek anti-HCV therapy in comparison to non-First Nation. In conclusion, the differences in the rates of HCV self-limiting infection between First Nation and non-First Nation individuals in Manitoba may reflect the genetic differences between the two cohorts, which may consequently affect the immune response to the HCV infection."
10493,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a worldwide health problem and mother-to-infant (or vertical) transmission is the main source of chronic infection in Asian countries. Administration of HBV vaccine to the infant at birth, with or without concurrent specific immunoglobulin, efficiently prevents such transmission (efficacy>90%). In France, testing Ag HBs is mandatory during pregnancy in all pregnant women. Infants born to Ag HBs-positive mothers should receive the first injection of vaccine and one injection of specific immunoglobulins at birth. Vaccination should thereafter be completed according to a three-injection protocol (at 1 and 6 months) or a four-injection protocol in case of prematurity. Failure of immunoprophylaxis can be observed when the viral load is very high in the mother during pregnancy (HBV-DNA levels>200,000 IU/mL). In such women, antiviral therapy with analogs (lamivudine, telbivudine, or tenofovir) during the third trimester of pregnancy and 1 month post-partum, in association with accurate immunoprophylaxis, may prevent vertical transmission. The optimal cut-off value of maternal viral load for antiviral therapy in late pregnancy and post-partum to prevent vertical transmission is still under debate. "
15060,0.005,1.0000,"While the mean age of HIV/AIDS patients at first diagnosis is progressively rising, no updated epidemiological estimates, controlled clinical data, and randomized therapeutic trials, are available regarding clinical and laboratory response to antiretroviral therapy, safety of anti-HIV compounds and their associations, potential drug-drug interactions, short- and long-term toxicity, consequences on underlying disorders, or interactions with concomitant pharmacological regimens, in the elderly. The life expectancy of HIV-infected persons treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) now approximates that of general population matched for age, while also AIDS definition itself has lost most of its epidemiological and clinical significance, thanks to the immunoreconstitution resulting from the large-scale use of potent HAART regimens. The increased survival of HIV-infected patients, the late recognition of other subjects with missed or delayed diagnosis are responsible for a further expected rise of mean age of HIV-infected individuals, so that the patient population aged 60-70 years or more is expected to increase in coming years. Unfortunately, the majority of therapeutic trials involving antiretroviral therapy, as well as antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis for AIDS-related opportunistic complications, have advanced age and/or concurrent end-organ disorders among main exclusion criteria, or the design of these studies does not allow to extrapolate data regarding older patients, compared with younger ones. The very limited data presently available seem to demonstrate that HAART has a virological efficacy in the elderly comparable with that of younger adults, but immunological recovery is often slower and blunted, although several studies clearly demonstrated that thymic function is preserved until late adult age. When facing an HIV-infected patient with advanced age, health care givers have to pay careful attention to eventual end-organ disorders, all possible pharmacological interactions, overlapping toxicity due to concurrent drug administration. All these issues may significantly interfere with HAART activity, patient's adherence to prescribed medications, and frequency and severity of untoward effects. The guidelines of antiretroviral therapy and those of treatment and prophylaxis of AIDS-related diseases deserve appropriate updates, paralleling the increasing mean age of HIV-infected population. Moreover, epidemiological figures need an increased focus on older age, while clinical trials specifically targeting on the elderly population are mandatory to have reliable data on all aspects of HAART administration in advanced age."
6766,0.005,1.0000,"The frequency and the cellular basis for HIV-1 transmission from mother to child in the early gestational period are poorly understood. We compared the placentas of 24 women seropositive for HIV-1 subtype E and who had not received any antiretroviral drugs, to placentas of 25 seronegative women. All placentas were obtained during therapeutic abortion at 6-23 weeks gestation. Placentas and fetal organs were examined by routine light microscopy, immunostaining for p24 capsid protein, and in situ PCR to localize which cells were infected with HIV-1 subtype E. The number of previous abortions was not a factor in placental HIV infection since this number was higher in seronegative women (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences between the placentas of the two groups with respect to presence of chorioamnionitis, villitis, villous stromal fibrosis, infarction, abnormal villous maturation, deciduitis or decidual necrosis. HIV-1 subtype E was detected in up to 83% of placentas, either by immunostaining or in situ PCR, in trophoblast, villous stromal cells, Hofbauer cells, decidual and decidual glandular epithelium. Fetal organs were positive for HIV in 30% (6/20) of cases. There was a significant association between transmission of HIV to the fetus and the histologic findings of chorioamnionitis, plasmacellular deciduitis and decidual cell necrosis. This is the first report showing an association of chorioamnionitis with early in utero transmission of HIV-1 subtype E. This may help explain the cases of in utero transmission that persist despite antiretroviral prophylaxis, given that therapy is started in the late gestational period."
4527,0.005,1.0000,"As the natural history of HIV infection has changed following the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), morbidity and mortality in the afflicted patients could be significantly reduced. The decreasing risk of suffering from opportunistic infections and tumors, however, is at the cost of antiretroviral drug-related toxicities. Today, mortality by liver disease is the major cause of death in HIV-infected patients from industrial countries. In the US and Europe about 30% of HIV-positive individuals are also infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and approximately 50-90% of persons who acquired HIV from injecting drugs are coinfected with HCV. In these dually infected individuals the presence of each viral infection impacts the natural history of the other one, and worsening of associated liver disease and complications within this population are increasing. The management of chronic hepatitis C (cHC) in HCV-HIV coinfection has become a major challenge, since possible interactions with antiretroviral therapies, increased risk of special side effects and compromises in adherence in patients already taking several drugs have to be taken into account. On the other hand, treatment strategies to fight HCV have been essentially ameliorated during the past 2 years by using pegylated interferon-alpha2b (Peg-IFN-alpha2b) combined with ribavirin, and there is hope that the successful therapeutic outcome in HCV-monoinfected individuals may beat least partly translated into benefits for the difficult-to-treat population of HCV-HIV dually infected persons. During the 15th International AIDS Conference in July 2002 in Barcelona, a satellite symposium, as well as a session in the main program and a number of poster presentations focussed on HCV-HIV coinfection and addressed the urgent problems and therapeutic challenges in managing cHC in the situation of underlying HIV disease."

The pre-established CD4+ cell count for restarting therapy was 300cells/μL. Cox regression was used to analyse the variables associated with earlier HAART reinitiation."
5117,0.005,1.0000,"With increasing life expectancy due to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the spectrum of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated morbidity and mortality has shifted from opportunistic infections toward associated chronic medical conditions. We report on a 26-year-old female patient receiving HAART for HIV infection, who developed spontaneous thrombosis of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery, resulting in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She had none of the conventional risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease. Following diagnostic coronary angiography that showed a large (16x3.4 mm) spontaneous thrombus in the proximal LAD artery, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed with prior aspiration of the occluding thrombus and implantation of a bare-metal stent. The patient was discharged with instruction of appropriate medical therapy. This case highlights the association between immunosuppression with HAART, particularly protease inhibitors, and the development of accelerated atherosclerosis in patients with HIV infection."
3628,0.005,1.0000,"Tuberculosis (TB) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection contribute to major disease mortality and morbidity worldwide. However, the causal link between HCV infection and TB risk remains unclear. We conducted a population-based cohort study to elucidate the association between HCV infection and TB disease by analyzing Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. We enrolled 5454 persons with HCV infection and 54,274 age- and sex-matched non-HCV-infected persons between January 1998 and December 2007. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to measure the association between HCV infection and active TB disease. Incidence rate of active TB disease was higher among HCV infection than in control (134.1 vs 89.1 per 100,000 person-years; incidence rate ratio 1.51; P = 0.014). HCV infection was significantly associated with active TB disease in multivariate Cox regression (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-5.53; P < 0.001) and competing death risk event analysis (adjusted HR 2.11; 95% CI, 1.39-3.20; P < 0.001). Multivariate stratified analysis further revealed that HCV infection was a risk of active TB disease in most strata. This nationwide cohort study suggests that HCV infection is associated with a higher risk of developing active TB disease. "
13783,0.005,1.0000,"A prospective study of transplacental transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) showed an increased rate of spontaneous fetal demise in HIV-seropositive mothers: 14 losses in 124 pregnancies. HIV was detected in placental and fetal tissues in 7 of 14 by in situ hybridization. The proportion of fetal infection far exceeded the transmission rate of 13% in liveborn babies. No association was seen between fetal transmission and a maternal history of drug abuse or coinfections; mothers with AIDS more often had fetal loss associated with HIV transmission than did asymptomatic mothers. In affected fetuses, HIV was detected in many tissues and was associated with thymic pathology. This suggests that maternal HIV infection increases the risk for pregnancy loss associated with HIV transmission. The possibility that HIV may be fetotoxic, that thymic dysfunction may interfere with pregnancy progression, or that the intrauterine milieu in HIV-seropositive pregnancies may be unfavorable (or a combination of factors) should be considered."
1205,0.005,1.0000,"Low serum total cholesterol (TC) is associated with a variety of nonatherosclerotic diseases, but the association of TC with infectious disease has been little studied. In this study, we examined the relationship between serum TC and HIV infection in members of a large health maintenance organization in Northern California. The cohort consisted of 2446 unmarried young men 15 to 49 years of age at high risk of HIV infection, defined as self-reported history of sexually transmitted disease or liver disease. Baseline measurements were taken between 1979 and 1985, and subjects were passively followed for HIV infection until the end of 1993 (average length of follow-up, 7.7 years). From a multivariate-adjusted Cox regression, the rate ratio (RR) of HIV infection was 1.66 (95% CI = 1.07, 2.56) for men with serum TC levels <160 mg/dl compared with those with TC levels between 160 and 199 mg/dl. Similar excess risk of AIDS and AIDS-related death was observed. These findings suggest that low serum TC levels should be considered a marker of increased risk of HIV infection in men already at heightened risk of HIV infection."

Grade 4 LEE was defined as aminotransferase levels >10 times the upper limit of normal and >200 U above baseline levels. A multivariate Cox model was used to identify risk factors. The incidence of LEE was 6.3%. No patients died of LEE consequences. Risk factors were higher baseline alanine aminotransferase levels, chronic hepatitis B or C virus infection, antiretroviral therapy-naive patients undergoing their first HAART regimen, recent start of a regimen of nevirapine or high-dose ritonavir, and female sex. In hepatitis B virus (HBV)-coinfected patients, discontinuing lamivudine (3TC) use was a risk factor. In 97% of cases, >or=1 risk factor was present. In HBV-coinfected patients using 3TC, continued use of 3TC should be considered, even if 3TC-resistant HIV strains develop."
19487,0.005,1.0000,"In Mozambique, the evaluation of retention in HIV care and ART programmes is limited. To assess rate and predictors of attrition (no retention in care) and HAART effectiveness in HIV-1 infected patients who pay for medication and laboratory testing in Mozambique, we conducted a multicenter survey of HIV-1-infected patients who started HAART during 2002-2006. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess risk of attrition and of therapy failure. Overall, 142 patients from 16 healthcare centers located in the capital city Maputo were followed-up for 22.2 months (12.1-46.7). The retention rate was 75%, 48% and 37% after one, two and three years, respectively. Risk of attrition was lower in patients with higher baseline CD4 count (P = 0.022) and attending healthcare center 1 (HCC1) (P = 0.013). The proportion of individuals with CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/µL was 55% (78/142) at baseline and decreased to 6% (3/52) at 36 months. Among the patients with available VL, 86% (64/74) achieved undetectable VL levels. The rate of immunologic failure was 17.2% (95% CI: 12.6-22.9) per 100 person-years. Risk of failure was associated to higher baseline CD4 count (P = 0.002), likely reflecting low adherence levels, and decreased with baseline VL ≥ 10,000 copies/mL (P = 0.033). These results suggest that HAART can be effective in HIV-1 infected patients from Mozambique that pay for their medication and laboratory testing. Further studies are required to identify the causes for low retention rates in patients with low CD4 counts and to better understand the association between healthcare setting and attrition rate."
10753,0.005,1.0000,"In spite of the progress made in vaccine and antiviral therapy development, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is still the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, with more than 400 million people chronically infected worldwide. Antiviral therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues and/or immunomodulating peptides is the only option to control and prevent the progression of the disease in chronic hepatitis B (CHB)-infected patients. So far, the current antiviral monotherapy remains unsatisfactory because of the low efficacy and the development of drug resistance mutants. Moreover, viral rebound is frequently observed following therapy cessation, since covalent closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is not removed from hepatocytes by antiviral therapy. First, this review describes the current pharmacotherapy for the management of CHB and the new drug candidates being investigated. Then, the challenges in the development of drug delivery systems for the targeting of antiviral drugs to the liver parenchyma are discussed. Finally, perspectives in the design of a more efficient pharmacotherapy to eradicate the virus from the host are addressed."

However, these antiviral agents have limited efficacy and do not result in a sustained virological response in the majority of infected patients. Virtual Screening (VS) strategies have now a strong impact on drug discovery, the strength of this research field has been corroborated by recent contributions in the development of novel drug candidates which are in clinical trials or which are already available in the clinics. In this context, different VS strategies have been applied to HBV in order to discover novel inhibitors. In this review, we summarize the VS efforts to identify and design novel HBV interventions. We believe that the combination of in silico and in vitro tools can lead to faster validation of novel drug targets which could accelerate the HBV drug discovery and development efforts."
1812,0.005,1.0000,"India's National AIDS Control Organization provides free antiretroviral treatment (ART) to people living with HIV (PLHIV), including members of marginalized groups such as injecting drug users (IDUs). To help inform development of interventions to enhance ART access, we explored barriers to free ART access at government ART centers for IDUs living with HIV in Chennai by conducting three focus groups (n = 19 IDUs) and four key informant interviews. Data were explored using framework analysis to identify categories and derive themes. We found interrelated barriers at the family and social, health-care system, and individual levels. Family and social level barriers included lack of family support and fear of societal discrimination, as well as unmet basic needs, including food and shelter. Health-care system barriers included actual or perceived unfriendly hospital environment and procedures such as requiring proof of address and identity from PLHIV, including homeless IDUs; provider perception that IDUs will not adhere to ART, resulting in ART not being initiated; actual or perceived inadequate counseling services and lack of confidentiality; and lack of effective linkages between ART centers, needle/syringe programs, and drug dependence treatment centers. Individual-level barriers included active drug use, lack of self-efficacy in ART adherence, low motivation to initiate ART stemming from a fatalistic attitude, and inadequate knowledge about ART. These findings indicate that to facilitate IDUs gaining access to ART, systemic changes are needed, including steps to make the environment and procedures at government ART centers more IDU-friendly and steps to decrease HIV- and drug use-related stigma and discrimination faced by IDUs from the general public and health-care providers. Housing support for homeless IDUs and linkage of IDUs with drug dependence treatment are also essential."
19736,0.005,1.0000,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a chronic infection that depletes the immune system of essential components causing those infected to be at risk for multiple life-threatening infections. Worldwide, millions live with this infection, the vast majority attributable to HIV-1. Transmission persists with hundreds of thousands of new infections reported yearly. Implementation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has been effective in improving outcomes and decreasing transmission. Newer co-formulated agents have provided simpler medication regimens, fewer side effects, and, in some cases, a higher barrier to the emergence of medication resistance. Areas covered: Here, we review trials of cabotegravir (CAB) as treatment of HIV-1 infection and its potential use as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in high risk individuals, including issues around oral lead in and potential resistance emergence. Expert opinion: CAB is efficacious when used in combination therapy orally or given intramuscularly every 4 to 8 weeks. Its availability in a long-acting injectable formulation (CAB-LA) makes it a valuable, novel drug to treat HIV-1 infection when combined with long-acting injectable rilpivirine (RPV-LA). Moreover, pre-clinical and early Phase 2a studies support its testing as monotherapy as PrEP. Studies are underway comparing the efficacy of every 8 week CAB-LA to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC)."
10837,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is extremely widespread - it infects two billion people out of the six billion world population. It is estimated that between 350 and 400 million people are chronically infected with HBV. Chronic HBV infection leads to development of complications, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which arise in 15-40% of patients. HBV-related liver disease and its complications result in approximately one million deaths each year. The ultimate goals of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) therapy are decreases in the incidence of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and HCC. The following six medications are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CHB: interferon (INF)-alpha2b, pegylated INF-alpha2a, lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir and, recently, telbivudine. Interferon therapy has many contraindications and commonly causes multiple intolerable adverse effects. Lamivudine therapy leads to increased development of resistant mutations with each year of use. Entecavir, a new guanosine nucleoside analogue with specific activity against HBV DNA polymerase, represents a third agent within the nucleoside/nucleotide HBV polymerase inhibitor class. It has distinct advantages over lamivudine and adefovir dipivoxil: it has a three-step mechanism of action, is the most potent inhibitor of HBV DNA polymerase, is not associated with any major adverse effects and has a limited potential for resistance. In clinical trials, entecavir was superior to lamivudine in all primary endpoints in both nucleoside-naive and lamivudine-refractory hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and HBeAg-negative patients. Preliminary data support entecavir efficacy in patients with cirrhosis and HIV/HBV coinfected patients. No resistance occurred after two years of entecavir therapy in nucleoside-naive patients. Up to 9% resistance developed in patients with documented prior lamivudine resistance during 96 weeks of entecavir therapy. Currently, entecavir should be considered a first- or second-line treatment option for the management of HBeAg-positive or -negative nucleoside-naive or lamivudine-refractory CHB patients."
4453,0.005,1.0000,"Approximately one-third of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are concomitantly infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). As a result, liver disease remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in HIV patients. Prior to 2011, treatments of HCV lacked efficacy in clinical trials in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Fortunately, several direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have now entered clinical practice and others have reached advanced stages of clinical development. These therapies offer significant benefits such as improved rates of sustained virologic response (SVR), shortened durations of treatment, and compatibility with HIV antiretroviral therapies. Treatments such as sofosbuvir (SOF) have received approval for HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Moreover, interferon-free options exist for HIV/HCV co-infected patients who may be ineligible or intolerant of interferon. Despite these improvements, physicians must be aware of the differences between these DAAs, the patient characteristics that play a role on the effectiveness of these medications, and the drug-drug interactions these DAAs may have with existing HIV antiretroviral therapies. The aim of this review is to discuss the prevalence and incidence of HIV/HCV co-infection, critical factors related to patient evaluation, current treatment options, and new developments in the management of HIV/HCV co-infected patients.

18193,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer, but the current therapies that employ either nucelos(t)ide analogs or (pegylated)interferon α do not clear the infection in the large majority of patients. Inhibitors of the HBV ribonuclease H (RNaseH) that are being developed with the goal of producing anti-HBV drugs are promising candidates for use in combination with the nucleos(t)ide analogs to improve therapeutic efficacy. HBV is genetically very diverse, with at least 8 genotypes that differ by ≥8% at the sequence level. This diversity is reflected in the viral RNaseH enzyme, raising the possibility that divergent HBV genotypes or isolates may have varying sensitivity to RNaseH inhibitors. To evaluate this possibility, we expressed and purified 18 patient-derived RNaseHs from genotypes B, C, and D. Basal RNaseH activity and sensitivity to three novel RNaseH inhibitors from three different chemotypes were assessed. We also evaluated four consensus HBV RNaseHs to determine if such sequences would be suitable for use in antiviral drug screening. The patient-derived enzymes varied by over 10-fold in their basal RNaseH activities, but they were equivalently sensitive to each of the three inhibitors. Similarly, all four consensus HBV RNaseH enzymes were active and were equally sensitive to an RNaseH inhibitor. These data indicate that a wide range of RNaseH sequences would be suitable for use in antiviral drug screening, and that genotype- or isolate-specific genetic variations are unlikely to present a barrier during antiviral drug development against the HBV RNaseH."
9388,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the efficacy of long-term lamivudine (3TC) and adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) combination therapy in 3TC-resistant chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patients, we analysed 28 3TC-resistant patients treated with the combination therapy during 47 months (range, 9-75). At 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, the rates of virological response with undetectable HBV DNA (≤ 2.6 log copies/mL) were 56, 80, 86, and 92%, respectively. Among 17 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients, HBeAg disappeared in 24% at 12 months, 25% at 24 months, 62% at 36 months, and 88% at 48 months. When HBV genotypes were compared, patients with genotype B achieved virological response significantly more rapidly than those with genotype C (P=0.0496). One patient developed virological breakthrough after 54 months, and sequence analysis of HBV obtained from the patient was performed. An rtA200V mutation was present in the majority of HBV clones, in addition to the 3TC-resistant mutations of rtL180M+M204V. The rtN236T ADV-resistant mutation was observed in only 25% clones. In vitro analysis showed that the rtA200V mutation recovered the impaired replication capacity of the clone with the rtL180M+M204V mutations and induced resistance to ADV. Moreover, rtT184S and rtS202C, which are known entecavir-resistant mutations, emerged in some rtL180M+M204V clones without rtA200V or rtN236T. In conclusion, 3TC+ADV combination therapy was effective for most 3TC-resistant patients, especially with genotype B HBV, but the risk of emergence of multiple drug-resistant strains with long-term therapy should be considered. The mutation rtA200V with rtL180M+M204V may be sufficient for failure of 3TC+ADV therapy."
1797,0.005,1.0000,"The primary objective of this study was to gain a clearer understanding of the barriers to adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) faced by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHIV/AIDS) on Long Island, New York. Focus group, a qualitative research method, was used to study these barriers. The study was conducted in 1998 on Long Island, NY, at five institutions that provide services to 1700 PLWHIV/AIDS. Five focus groups were conducted with 6 to 13 PLWHIV/AIDS in each group, a total of 39 subjects. PLWHIV/AIDS identified eight common barriers to adherence to HAART. In descending order, the barriers include: (1) frequency and severity of side effects, (2) conflicts with daily routines, (3) dietary requirements, (4) frequency of taking medications, (5) number and dosage of medications, (6) psychosocial factors (i.e., stress, feeling good, and bad news), (7) pharmacy refills, and (8) physiological needs (i.e., sleep, hunger, or thirst). Many factors play a role in the success or failure of HAART, including preexisting drug resistance, drug-drug interactions, and the ability of PLWHIV/AIDS to adhere to a rigid and frequently changing medication regimen. The information gleaned from focus groups is limited in that it may not be generalized to a larger population with any known reliability. However, clinicians sensitive to barriers to adherence to HAART, including those identified by PLWHIV/AIDS in this study, may play a more proactive role in supporting adherence to the medication regimen, increasing the durability of effective viral suppression, decreasing morbidity and mortality, and decreasing the selection and transmission of resistant strains of HIV."
9042,0.005,1.0000,"Within a prospective cohort of 150 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who began first-line protease inhibitor therapy in 1996, the outcome of 42 patients with discrepant virologic and immunologic responses to antiretroviral treatment at 12 months was analyzed at 30 months of treatment. The incidence of AIDS-defining events and deaths (14%) in the group of patients with immunologic responses in the absence of a virologic response was higher than that in full-responder patients (2%); yet, the incidence in this group was lower than that in patients with no immunologic response, despite a virologic response (21%), and was lower than that in patients without an immunologic or virologic response (67%; P<.0001, log-rank test). Differences in outcome were significant (relative risk, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-39.3) when factors for progression were compared with those of responder patients. The results support the relevance of the CD4 cell marker over plasma HIV load for predicting clinical outcome in patients who do not achieve full immunologic and virologic responses."
16857,0.005,1.0000,"Many aspects of the complex interaction between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the human immune system remain elusive. Our objective was to study these interactions, focusing on the specific roles of dendritic cells (DCs). DCs enhance HIV-1 infection processes as well as promote an antiviral immune response. We explored the implications of these dual roles. A mathematical model describing the dynamics of HIV-1, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and DCs interacting in a human lymph node was analysed and is presented here. We have validated the behaviour of our model against non-human primate simian immunodeficiency virus experimental data and published human HIV-1 data. Our model qualitatively and quantitatively recapitulates clinical HIV-1 infection dynamics. We have performed sensitivity analyses on the model to determine which mechanisms strongly affect infection dynamics. Sensitivity analysis identifies system interactions that contribute to infection progression, including DC-related mechanisms. We have compared DC-dependent and -independent routes of CD4+ T-cell infection. The model predicted that simultaneous priming and infection of T cells by DCs drives early infection dynamics when activated T-helper cell numbers are low. Further, our model predicted that, while direct failure of DC function and an indirect failure due to loss of CD4+ T-helper cells are both significant contributors to infection dynamics, the former has a more significant impact on HIV-1 immunopathogenesis."
4452,0.005,1.0000,"We analyzed IL-2 and IL-10 serum levels in 26 HIV-1-infected patients naive of antiretroviral treatment and in 34 patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). All patients without treatment were asymptomatic. When they were stratified according to levels of CD4+ T cells, IL-2 levels were significantly increased in patients with > or =200 CD4+/microl and IL-10 levels were significantly increased in patients with <200 CD4+/microl compared to controls. A significant negative correlation was observed between IL10 levels and CD4+ T-cell counts. No correlation was observed between IL-2 and IL-10 levels and viral load due to the wide range of variability in the number of HIV copies/ml present in the different patients. However, IL-2 levels were higher in patients with high viral load than in patients with low viral load. In patients with HAART, IL-2 and IL-10 levels were similar to the control group and no differences were detected respecting CD4+ T cells counts and viral load. Our findings show that the modifications in IL-2 and IL-10 serum levels in HIV-1-infected patients naive of antiretroviral treatment are associated with the progression of immunological damage. Furthermore, they show a dysbalance of type-1/type-2 cytokines with an involvement of type-2 cytokines in later stages of HIV infection. Cytokine dysregulation can be reversed by HAART in the context of immune restoration and viral suppression."
5330,0.005,1.0000,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) produced in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures or added exogenously has been shown to upregulate HIV expression in vitro. Inhibition of IL-1 in HIV-infected individuals may inhibit HIV activation and slow disease progression. Recombinant human IL-1 receptor (rHu-IL-1R), the soluble extracellular portion of the human type I IL-1 receptor, inhibits HIV expression in acutely infected primary PBMCs and in the chronically infected promonocytic cell line, U1. We, therefore, conducted a phase I/II trial of the soluble rHu-IL-1R in HIV-1-infected individuals with CD4 T cell counts <300/microl to evaluate its safety and activity. Twelve evaluable patients were enrolled at three rHu-IL-1R dose levels:125 (n=3), 500 (n=3), and 1250 (n=6) microg/m2 per dose by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection three times a week for 8 weeks, followed by a 4 week observation period. rHu-IL-1R was safe and well tolerated. There were no deaths, no treatment-related grade 3/4 events, and no premature study discontinuations because of adverse events. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Seven patients reported improvements in one or more symptoms, including weight gain (3), improved energy level (4), decreased diarrhea (1), decreased night sweats (1), improvement in psoriatic arthritis (1), and improvement in a nonspecific chronic diffuse skin rash (1). Of 3 evaluable patients with Kaposi's sarcoma, 1 remained stable and 2 showed minimal progression. No consistent trends in absolute CD4 counts or percentages, quantitative HIV cultures, or serum p24 antigen, beta2-microglobulin, or triglyceride levels were observed. rHu-IL-1R is safe and well tolerated at the doses tested but induced no consistent changes in objective markers of HIV disease. Symptomatic improvements will require confirmation in randomized, placebo-controlled trials."
18688,0.005,1.0000,"In this study we analyzed the influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the course of chronic hepatitis C through multivariate analysis including age, alcohol consumption, immune status, and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related virologic factors. Eighty HIV-positive and 80 HIV-negative injection drug users included between 1980 and 1995 were matched according to age, gender, and duration of HCV infection and followed-up during 52 months. The progression to cirrhosis was the primary outcome measure. The impact of HIV on HCV-RNA load, histologic activity index, response to interferon therapy, and liver-related death was also considered. In HIV-positive patients, chronic hepatitis C was characterized by higher serum HCV-RNA levels (P =.012), higher total Knodell score (P =.011), and poorer sustained response to interferon therapy (P =.009). High serum HCV-RNA level was associated with low CD4-lymphocyte count (P =.001). Necroinflamatory score was higher in HIV-positive patients (P =.023) independently of the CD4-lymphocyte count, whereas increased fibrosis was related to decreased CD4-lymphocyte count (P =.011). The progression to cirrhosis was accelerated in HIV-positive patients with low CD4 cell count (RR = 4.06, P =.024) and in interferon-untreated patients (RR = 4.76, P =.001), independently of age at HCV infection (P =.001). Cirrhosis caused death in 5 HIV-positive patients. The risk of death related to cirrhosis was increased in heavy drinkers (RR = 10.8, P =.001) and in HIV-positive patients with CD4 cell count less than 200/mm(3) (RR = 11.9, P =.007). In this retrospective cohort study, HIV coinfection worsened the outcome of chronic hepatitis C, increasing both serum HCV-RNA level and liver damage and decreasing sustained response to interferon therapy. Age and alcohol were cofactors associated with cirrhosis and mortality. Interferon therapy had a protective effect against HCV-related cirrhosis no matter what the patient's HIV status was."
7644,0.005,1.0000,"A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing two daily doses of oral ribavirin (600 mg and 800 mg) and placebo was conducted at six medical centers. Two hundred fifteen adults were enrolled over a 5-month period and randomized to receive ribavirin 800 mg daily (74 subjects), ribavirin 600 mg (71 subjects), or placebo (70 subjects). Active treatment was administered for 24 weeks followed by a 4-week wash-out period. Fifteen patients receiving placebo, 10 receiving ribavirin 600 mg, and 18 receiving ribavirin 800 mg developed AIDS during the 28-week study period. Ribavirin at daily doses of 600 mg or 800 mg for 24 weeks did not significantly affect the rate of progression to AIDS as defined by the Centers for Disease Control, in univariate analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, or Cox proportional hazards modeling. Although in the proportional hazards analysis, the dose-response regression coefficients indicated a reduction of 43% in the hazard of progression to AIDS among patients on active treatment, it was not statistically significant (p = 0.19). Furthermore, there was no evidence that ribavirin had a significant effect upon any immunologic or virologic parameter measured, including CD4 count, CD4:CD8 ratio, lymphocyte proliferative response, skin test reactivity, interferon-gamma production, peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or level of HIV p24 antigen in serum. The most prominent adverse effect of ribavirin was induction of a mild reversible hemolytic anemia (mean fall in hematocrit, 5%). No severe or unremitting drug reaction was documented."
9770,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) is associated with development of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS); therefore also known as KS-associated herpes virus. KS is closely associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and consequently HHV8 seroprevalence is higher in HIV-infected compared to HIV-negative patients. Currently, KS is rarely seen in clinical practice, which might be a consequence of an optimized anti-HIV treatment leading to an improved immunological status, or alternatively of a decrease in HHV8 prevalence. To determine the prevalence of HHV8 antibodies in HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative patients from the University Hospital Frankfurt/Main, Germany, and to compare our results with previously published data to illustrate trends in the spread of infection. Hundred serum samples each of HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients were analyzed for HHV8 antibodies by using an IgG immunofluorescence test. The overall HHV8 seroprevalence was 16% with no statistically significant gender-specific differences; however, the distribution between the HIV-infected patients and the HIV-negative control group was significantly different (30 and 2%, respectively). The highest rate of seroprevalence in HIV-infected patients was detected at the age of 40-49 (42%) and the lowest rate at the age of 20-29 years (16.6%). In comparison with formerly conducted studies, our data clearly showed an increase in the HHV8 seroprevalence in HIV-infected patients, both in men and women. Therefore, we conclude that the low rate of clinical KS is associated with an improved immunological status due to an optimized anti-HIV therapy."

Androgen deficiency in HIV-infected patients is associated with decreased muscle mass and function, and adverse disease outcome. Administration of replacement doses of testosterone to healthy hypogonadal men augments lean body mass, muscle size, and maximal voluntary strength. Recent studies have shown that physiologic testosterone replacement in HIV-infected men with weight loss who have low testosterone levels can also increase muscle mass and effort-dependent strength. However, further studies are needed to determine whether androgen therapy can improve physical function and health-related outcomes in HIV-infected men."
3083,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to study the development of HCV-specific T cell immunity during acute HCV infection in the presence of an existing HIV-1 infection in four HIV-1 infected men having sex with men. A comprehensive analysis of HCV-specific T cell responses was performed at two time points during acute HCV infection using a T cell expansion assay with overlapping peptide pools spanning the entire HCV genome Three patients with (near) normal CD4+ T cell counts (range 400-970 x 10(6)/L) either resolved (n=1) or temporary suppressed HCV RNA. In contrast, one patient with low CD4+ T cell counts (330 x 10(6)/L), had sustained high HCV RNA levels. All four patients had low HCV-specific CD8+ T cell responses, and similar magnitudes of CD4+ T cell responses. Interestingly, individuals with resolved infection or temporary suppression of HCV-RNA had HCV-specific CD4+ T cell responses predominantly against nonstructural (NS) proteins. While the individual with high HCV RNA plasma concentrations had CD4+ T cell responses predominantly directed against Core. Our data show that an acute HCV infection in an HIV-1 infected person can be suppressed in the presence of HCV-specific CD4+ T cell response targeting non-structural proteins. However further research is needed in a larger group of patients to evaluate the role of HIV-1 on HCV-specific T cell responses in relation to outcome of acute HCV infection."
10697,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to determine the association between sinusitis and survival among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons. All patients enrolled in the adult spectrum of disease data base from November 1, 1990 to November 1, 1999 were included. Patients were followed until death, loss to follow-up, or the end of the study on January 10, 2000. A Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between sinusitis, various other cofactors, and survival. Of the 7513 HIV-infected patients followed, 57% were <35 years old, 59.5% were black, 78.5% were male, and 20.8% had an opportunistic infection (OI) at entry. The incidence of one or more diagnoses of sinusitis in the cohort was 14.5%. The mean entry CD4 count for the entire cohort was 347.8 (SD, 298.9) and the mean follow-up time was 33.2 months (SD, 25.7). The mean CD4 count at the time of sinusitis diagnosis was 391 (SD, 316). In the multivariate analysis, older age and lower CD4 cell count were associated with death. Sinusitis, gender, and race were not associated with survival. Sinusitis is frequent in individuals infected with HIV. After adjusting for level of immunodeficiency, age, gender, and race, sinusitis is not associated with an increased hazard of death. This may have implications for treatment, because a diagnosis of sinusitis does not portend a poor prognosis in individuals infected with HIV."

We aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of positive syphilis serology in HIV-infected adult patients in an outpatient setting in Thailand. A cross sectional study was conducted among 178 HIV-infected patients. Ninety-eight patients (55%) were male; then median (interquartile range; IQR) age was 43 (36-49) years. The majority of the patients (84.3%) had a heterosexual risk. Three patients (1.7%) had a positive rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test (range, 1:2 to 1:16), 9 (5%) patients had a positive Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) test, and 3 patients (1.7%) had positive results on both tests. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, a pruritic papular eruption [odds ratio (OR) 5.37; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09-26.38; p = 0.038], current CD4 cell count (OR 1.22, per 50 cells/mm3; 95% CI: 1.01-1.46; p = 0.035), and using abacavir in the current regimen (OR 59.19; 95% CI: 2.15-1,628.68; p = 0.016) were associated with positive syphilis serology. In conclusion, the prevalence of positive syphilis serology among Thai HIV-infected patients was low. Routine screening for syphilis in HIV-infected patients who are asymptomatic may need to be re-considered at the national level in this resource-limited setting."

Data from 1,938 young sexually active women who lived in five U.S. cities where the risk for human immunodeficiency virus is high were analyzed by using logistic, ordinal, and multiple linear regression analysis. For the pros scale of condom use, 27% of the women had low scores, and 33% had moderate scores. For the cons scale, 27% had moderate scores, and 5% had high scores. Of the total, 47% had a negative score on the decisional balance measure. Older age, living with a spouse or partner, or binge drinking was associated with lower pros scores and with a negative score on the decisional balance measure. Income from public assistance was associated with higher pros scores. Income from a spouse or partner or a history of sexually transmitted disease was associated with lower pros scores. Multiple sex partners or being at risk for HIV infection (based on perceptions of the main partner's behaviors) was associated with higher cons scores. Income from a job was associated with a positive score on the decisional balance measure. Our analysis identified the characteristics of women who have low pros scores, high cons scores, and negative decisional balance scores. The regression results can inform our work in HIV prevention on whether to focus on the pros, the cons, or both to obtain positive decisional balance scores and increase condom use in situations that warrant protective behaviors."
2512,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated the changes in the progression to death and AIDS and in the mean level of CD4 lymphocytes by calendar period in HIV-positive individuals before and after the introduction of HAART. Through data collected in a prospective cohort study (Italian Seroconversion Study) of 1899 HIV-infected persons with well estimated date of seroconversion, considered as time-zero of analysis, we calculated Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models, allowing for staggered entries, to estimate the cumulative probability of survival and hazard-ratios (HR) for death and for AIDS by calendar period (1980-1996: pre-HAART era, 1997-1998: first HAART era, and 1999-2001: second HAART era), age at seroconversion, gender, and exposure category. During 17251 person-years, 660 HIV-positive patients developed AIDS and 510 died. Before 1997, the cumulative probability of survival, at twelve years from seroconversion, was 51.0%. In the period 1997-1998 the probability was 77.3% and in the period 1999-2001 it further increased at 91.2%. In the period 1980-1996 only older age at seroconversion was associated with more rapid progression to death. In the period 1987-2001 individuals infected through injecting drug use had a reduced increase of survival compared to those infected through sexual contact. Similar results were obtained for progression to AIDS. Finally we estimated an improved level of immunesuppression in the period 1987-2001. In fact, while in the period 1980-1996 we estimated a decrease of the CD4 lymphocites of -54.8 cells/mm3 (95% CI: -52.0; -57.6) per year; after 1996, we estimated an increase of CD4 of +39.6 (95% CI +34.1; +45.1)per year. This study provides strong evidence that the efficacy of the HAART estimated in the controlled clinical trials has resulted in a real reduction at the population level of morbidity and mortality."
8608,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals develop a genetically diverse virus population over time, but often only a limited number of viral variants are transmitted from a chronic carrier to a newly infected person. Interestingly, many women but few men are infected by multiple HIV-1 variants from a single partner. To determine whether the complexity of the infecting virus population influences clinical outcome, we examined viral diversity in the HIV-1 envelope sequences present at primary infection in 156 women from Kenya for whom we had follow-up data on viral RNA levels and CD4 T-cell counts. Eighty-nine women had multiple viral genotypes, while 67 women had a single genotype at primary infection. Women who acquired multiple viral genotypes had a significantly higher viral load (median, 4.84 versus 4.64 log(10) copies/ml, P = 0.04) and a significantly lower CD4(+)-T-cell count (median, 416 versus 617 cells/mm(3), P = 0.01) 4 to 24 months after infection compared to women who were infected with a single viral genotype. These studies suggest that early HIV-1 genetic diversity is linked to faster disease progression."

Blood samples were drawn from adult inmates in all State prisons who agreed to participate in this cross-sectional study. Data on risk behaviors were collected by using self-administered questionnaires. The prevalence of HIV, syphilis, HBV, and HCV infection was 0.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.2-1.1], 0.7% (95% CI = 0.4-1.0), 0.4 (95% CI = 0.04-0.74), and 4.8 (95% CI = 3.6-5.9), respectively. Female inmates had a higher prevalence of HIV (1.5% vs. 0.6%, p = .05), whereas male inmates had a higher prevalence of HCV (1% vs. 5%, p = .008). Twenty percent (n = 443, 95% CI = 15-26) of the participants were tattooed during incarceration, and most of them were tattooed with recycled materials. Around 60% (57%, 95% CI = 49-65) used drugs before incarceration, and 9.2% (n = 205) used injected drugs. During incarceration, 30% (95% CI = 23-39) used drugs and 43 continued injecting (20% of users). Consistent condom use was low among men before incarcerations but decreased by half during incarceration. The highest consistent condom use before incarceration was among men who have sex with men (MSM) (17.7%, 95% CI = 14-22), but it decreased (9%, 95% CI = 3-14) during incarceration. The prevalence of HIV, HBV, HCV, and syphilis in these inmates is higher than that of the local adult population. Most inmates had sex in prison, but few used condoms consistently. Access to condoms is apparently harder for MSM. Interventions to increase condom use, reduce use of shared or recycled materials for tattooing and injecting drugs, and treatment for drug abuse are needed."

A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 311 HIV-positive people (177 men and 134 women) aged 18-60 years residing in Kathmandu, Nepal. The atomic absorption method was used to measure serum zinc concentrations and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-Ia method was used to measure depression, with cut off score 20 or higher consistent with clinically significant depression. Relationships were assessed using multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. Serum zinc concentrations were significantly inversely associated with depression in all participants and in men but not in women. Participants with the highest tertile of serum zinc concentrations had a significantly decreased risk of depression in men but not in women. Serum zinc concentrations were inversely associated with depressive symptoms scores in HIV-infected men. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm the role of zinc in depression among persons infected with HIV."
6682,0.005,1.0000,"To assess the effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) immunosuppression on ongoing hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, CD4 lymphocyte counts and serum concentrations of HCV RNA, HIV RNA, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were evaluated among members of a cohort of injecting drug users (IDUs). With 100 participants randomly selected at various stages of HIV-related immunosuppression, serum HCV RNA concentrations increased with age (P = .007) and were higher in HIV-positive IDUs with 201-500 (P = .026) and 51-200 (P = .004) CD4 cells/mL than in HIV-negative participants. Among 27 HCV-infected IDUs who acquired HIV infection, serum HCV RNA concentrations varied between semiannual visits by a mean of 0.45 logs, increasing by 0.60 logs after HIV seroconversion (P < .0001), by 0.12 logs each subsequent year (P = .006), and by 0.36 logs per log increase in CD4 cells (P = .01). Serum ALT levels were similar between HIV-positive (40.1 IU/mL) and HIV-negative (45.4 IU/mL) patients (P > .10). While HIV infection and possibly HIV progression are associated with increased HCV RNA levels, other factors appear to affect biochemical and virologic markers of HCV infection in some dually infected persons."
1710,0.005,1.0000,"CD4(+) T cells play critical roles in the immune system and, being primary targets of HIV infection, they are used to measure disease progression and response to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), alongside other parameters, in HIV/AIDS patients. The aim of this study was to determine the reference values of CD4(+) T cells in a student population that was HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) negative. After ethical clearance and informed consent, 500 subjects (mean age = 26 years) were recruited, of whom 56 (11.2%) had HIV, HBV or HCV and were excluded. Blood samples were collected from the remaining 444 subjects into vacutainer tubes and analysed using the BD FACScount cytometer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Of the 444 subjects, 266 (59.9%) were male and 178 (40.1%) were female. The mean (± standard deviation) CD4(+) T cell count was 987 cells/µL (± 336). The mean counts among males and females were 957 cells/µL (± 306) and 991 cells/µL (± 340), respectively. Values of CD4(+) T cells ranged from 651 cells/µL to 1705 cells/µL. Subjects with higher CD4(+) T Cells were more likely to be female than male. There was no direct correlation between CD4(+) T cell values and age of the participants. Our findings offer the first insight into the CD4(+) T cell reference values of a Nigerian student population and provide useful data that will guide future cART decisions and other immune-based therapies."
16382,0.005,1.0000,"One hundred ninety-three asymptomatic patients with hereditary coagulation disorders and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were studied in a controlled trial of zidovudine (ZDV) versus a placebo (with an average of 9.7 months on study). Pretreatment characteristics were well balanced between the placebo and drug-treated groups, including CD4 distributions, types of clotting disorders, transaminase abnormalities, and use of various hemostatic agents. At the time of analysis, 161 patients either were still receiving treatment or had previously reached an endpoint of disease progression while receiving treatment. Twenty-five patients withdrew voluntarily. The toxic effects noted included granulocytopenia and anemia, especially in older patients, and subjective symptoms of asthenia, malaise, and nausea, consistent with the known consequences of treatment with 300 mg ZDV five times daily. There was a trend toward more diagnoses of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), advanced or early AIDS-related complex (ARC), single ARC symptoms, or death in placebo recipients as compared with those receiving ZDV (22 v 13). Because older patients with hemophilia have more rapid disease progression, the same efficacy analysis was performed in the 89 patients aged more than 30 years who were receiving treatment. In this subgroup, there was a similar trend (11 v 6). With regard to the most advanced problems of the infection among the older patients, there were five patients who were newly diagnosed with AIDS or died in the placebo group versus none in the ZDV group (P = .02) among the older patients. The pretreatment distribution of CD4 counts for the placebo and ZDV groups were similar, but patients aged more than 30 years had significantly (P less than .049) fewer CD4 cells than patients aged less than 30 years. A beneficial ZDV effect is also supported by a trend toward higher CD4 counts (a 48-cell increase in the ZDV group at 24 weeks as compared with a four-cell increase in the placebo group) and a significant (P = .03) difference in weight gain in the ZDV patients aged more than 30 years (8 pounds) as compared with the older placebo patients (aged more than 30 years) (2 pounds) at week 24. The findings in the asymptomatic hemophilic patients aged more than 30 years support a useful effect of ZDV, which is similar to observations in the larger study of its use in asymptomatic, nonhemophilic patients."
13122,0.005,1.0000,"Elevated CD4 T-cell turnover may lead to the exhaustion of the immune system during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections. However, this hypothesis remains controversial. Most studies of this subject have concerned the blood, and information about the lymph nodes is rare and controversial. We used Ki67 expression to measure cycling T cells in the blood and lymph nodes of uninfected macaques and of macaques infected with a pathogenic SIVmac251 strain or with a nonpathogenic SIVmac251Deltanef clone. During the asymptomatic phase of infection, the number of cycling CD8(+) T cells progressively increased (two- to eightfold) both in the blood and in the lymph nodes of macaques infected with SIVmac251. This increase was correlated with viral replication and the progression to AIDS. In contrast, no increases in the numbers of cycling CD4(+) T cells were found in the blood or lymph nodes of macaques infected with the pathogenic SIVmac251 strain in comparison with SIVmac251Deltanef-infected or healthy macaques during this chronic phase. However, the lymph nodes of pre-AIDS stage SIVmac251-infected macaques contained more cycling CD4(+) T cells (low baseline CD4(+)-T-cell counts in the blood). Taken together, these results show that the profiles of CD4(+)- and CD8(+)-T-cell dynamics are distinct both in the lymph nodes and blood and suggest that higher CD4(+)-T-cell proliferation at the onset of AIDS may lead to the exhaustion of the immune system."
326,0.005,1.0000,"Natural killer (NK) cells bridge the interface between innate and adaptive immunity and are implicated in the control of herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection. In subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), the critical impact of the innate immune response on disease progression has recently come into focus. Higher numbers of NK cells are associated with lower HIV-1 plasma viraemia. Individuals with the compound genotype of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DS1 and human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-Bw4-80I, or who have alleles of KIR3DL1 that encode proteins highly expressed on the NK cell surface, have a significant delay in disease progression. We studied the effect of HSV-2 co-infection in HIV-1-infected subjects, and show that HSV-2 co-infection results in a pan-lymphocytosis, with elevated absolute numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and NK cells. The NK cells in HSV-2 co-infected subjects functioned more efficiently, with an increase in degranulation after in vitro stimulation. The number of NK cells expressing the activating receptors NKp30 and NKp46, and expressing KIR3DL1 or KIR3DS1, was inversely correlated with HIV-1 plasma viral load in subjects mono-infected with HIV-1, but not in subjects co-infected with HSV-2. This suggests that HSV-2 infection mediates changes within the NK cell population that may affect immunity in HIV-1 infection."
4410,0.005,1.0000,"Individuals living with HIV often have complicated histories, including negative experiences such as traumatic events, mental illness, and stigma. As the medical community in the United States adapts to managing HIV as a chronic disease, understanding factors such as these negative experiences that may be associated with poorer adherence to treatment regimens, greater HIV risk behavior, and lower patient quality of life becomes critical to HIV care and prevention. In less wealthy nations, these issues are also critical for addressing quality of life as well as medication adherence in the areas where antiretroviral therapies are being made available. This article presents a review of the literature regarding the following psychosocial factors as they relate to HIV/AIDS in the US and globally: traumatic events; mental illness, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder; lack of trust in the healthcare system and government; and experiences of stigma among individuals with HIV disease. These factors have been found to be prevalent among individuals with HIV/AIDS, regardless of gender or race/ethnicity. Traumatic events, mental illness, distrust, and stigma have also been linked with poorer adherence to medication regimens and HIV risk behavior."
14747,0.005,1.0000,"Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) most often have hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B (HBV) virus coinfection, or both, as a cause of their liver disease. Recent survival statistics show that patients infected with HIV treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can expect a significant prolongation of life by interfering with the natural progression of HIV to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Therefore, HIV-positive patients experiencing complications of liver failure are at greater immediate risk of dying from their end-stage liver disease (ESLD) rather than their HIV. Many transplant centers still consider HIV infection as a contraindication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). At our two institutions, we believe that patients with HIV suffering from ESLD should be considered for OLT. This study evaluates the survival of patients undergoing OLT with HIV under HAART therapy. OLT was performed in 16 patients with HIV suffering from ESLD as a result of chronic HCV, chronic HBV, or fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). Collected data include patient demographics, patient and graft survival, pre-OLT assessments, and postoperative complications (including opportunistic infections). Ten patients at Pittsburgh and 6 patients at Miami received OLT. Of the 16 patients who received OLT, 14 remain alive to date. Thirteen of 16 patients are more than 12 months post-OLT, whereas the last patient is currently 6 months post-OLT. Five patients at Miami and 9 of 10 patients at Pittsburgh received HAART therapy before OLT, although 2 of the Pittsburgh patients had their HAART therapy discontinued before OLT because of significant liver dysfunction. The pre-OLT viral loads were undetectable in 13 of 16 patients. The cluster determinant (CD)4 count was less than 200 in 6 patients and greater than 100 in 2 patients before OLT. In all patients, CD4 counts increased above 200 in the post-OLT period. Tacrolimus toxicity associated with the pharmacologic inhibition of cytochrome p450 metabolism caused by protease inhibitors occurred in 6 patients after OLT. Six patients (38%) experienced acute cellular rejection immediately after OLT. Our experience suggests that OLT is effective in selected HIV-positive patients suffering from ESLD. Patient and graft survival was similar to non-HIV-positive patients suffering from the same indications for OLT. Acute cellular rejection was no less frequent that seen in non-HIV-positive patients. Given the complex pharmacologic interactions between the protease inhibitors and tacrolimus, careful monitoring, and attention is required to prevent toxicity or underdosing."
15,0.005,1.0000,"Strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that use the coreceptor CXCR4 (X4 strains) become laboratory adapted (LA) when selected for ability to replicate in leukemic T cell lines such as H9. Compared with patient X4 viruses, the gp120-gp41 complexes of LA viruses have a constellation of common properties including enhanced affinities for CD4, greater sensitivities to inactivations by diverse antibodies and by soluble CD4, increased shedding of gp120, and improved abilities to infect HeLa-CD4 cell clones that contain only trace quantities of CD4. These common characteristics, which may result from a concerted structural rearrangement of the gp120-gp41 complexes, have made it difficult to identify a specific feature that is critical for laboratory adaptation. To test the hypothesis that replication of patient X4 HIV-1 is limited by the low CD4 concentration in H9 cells (7.0 x 10(3) CD4/cell), we constructed H9 derivatives that express at least 10 times more of this receptor. Interestingly, most patient X4 isolates readily grew in these derivative cells, and the resulting virus preparations retained the characteristics of primary viruses throughout multiple passages. In contrast, selection of the same viruses in the parental H9 cells resulted in outgrowth of LA derivatives. We conclude that a weak interaction of patient X4 HIV-1 isolates with CD4 is the primary factor that limits their replication in leukemic T cell lines."
16872,0.005,1.0000,"Acute kidney injury is common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Before the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy, acute kidney injury in HIV-positive patients was most commonly the result of volume depletion, septicemia, or nephrotoxic medications. Acute kidney injury remains a significant problem in the antiretroviral era, and still commonly is attributed to infection or nephrotoxic medications. Less common causes such as direct infectious insults, immune restoration inflammatory syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and obstruction should be considered when the underlying process is not obvious. In addition to advanced HIV disease, several other patient characteristics have emerged as potential risk factors for acute kidney injury in the antiretroviral era, including older age, diabetes, pre-existing chronic kidney disease, and hepatitis co-infection or liver disease."
3871,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic infection with HIV type 1 is associated with alterations in macronutrient metabolism, specifically elevated plasma lipids, glucose and reduced insulin sensitivity. These alterations are most severe in patients at the later stages of AIDS, indicating a relationship with disease progression. Recently, a metabolic syndrome, termed lipodystrophy, has been described in successfully-treated HIV patients in whom the altered macronutrient metabolism of HIV infection appears to be amplified markedly, with concurrent alterations in adipose tissue patterning. This syndrome presents a paradox, as before the development of highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) the most severe perturbations in metabolism were observed in the sickest patients. Now, the patients that respond well to therapy are showing metabolic perturbations much greater than those seen before. The implications of this syndrome are that, whilst life expectancy may be increased by reducing viral load, there are concomitant increases in the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and pancreatitis within this patient population. The aetiology of the syndrome remains unclear. In a collaborative trial with the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London we have used stable-isotope-labelled fatty acids to examine the hypothesis that treatment with HAART causes a delayed clearance of dietary lipid from the circulation, resulting in the retention of lipid within plasma and the downstream changes in insulin and glucose homeostasis. This hypothesis would indicate a role for low-fat diets, exercise and drugs that reduce plasma lipid or insulin resistance, in modulating the response to antiretroviral therapy in HIV infection."
12446,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. Several risk factors for HCC development have been identified, including cirrhosis, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. With regard to cirrhosis, multivariate analysis indicates that alcohol abuse, HBsAg positivity, and anti-HCV seropositivity are independent variables associated with an increased risk for HCC in the cirrhotic patient. A close relationship between chronic HBV infection and HCC has been established by epidemiological studies and laboratory investigations. Evidence indicates that HCV also plays a leading role in development of HCC. Most patients with HCV-related HCC develop the tumor as a consequence of long-standing infection accompanied by chronic and progressive liver damage. In our study of 290 consecutive patients with cirrhosis, patients with persistently elevated or fluctuating ALT levels had a significantly greater rate of HCC development. The mechanism of HCC development in HCV infection remains to be elucidated. The annual cumulative risk of developing HCC is approximately 1% in patients without cirrhosis at inclusion and 3-10% in those with cirrhosis, depending on the stage of cirrhosis and presence of etiological cofactors. Although some evidence suggests that patients infected with the HCV genotype 1b are at increased risk for development of more severe liver disease, including HCC, results of our prospective study do not support a difference between cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients in terms of the natural course of cirrhosis and the rate of developing HCC based on genotype. Strategies to prevent HCV-related HCC include blood screening and treatment of chronic HCV infection with interferon-alpha. Recent studies suggest that interferon-alpha treatment may prevent the development of HCC in HCV infection. Further research is warranted."
15067,0.005,1.0000,"HIV/HCV coinfection is associated with accelerated progressive liver disease. Understanding the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis remains crucial to improving the global management of this patient population. This review will mainly focus on the mechanisms involved in the faster progression of liver fibrosis seen in HIV/HCV coinfection, which is caused by a multiplicity of complex factors including virus features, the immune system, interactions between viruses and the immune response, the direct effects of HIV on hepatocytes, fibrinogenetic/inflammatory mediators, microbial translocation, and metabolic abnormalities. The direct role of viruses as well as chronic inflammation, deterioration of immune status, and the harmful effect of antiretroviral agents may all concur to produce dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. Metabolic abnormalities play an important role in the genesis of hepatic steatosis, which is closely linked to liver fibrosis progression. There is also a link between immunologic and metabolic abnormalities: increased expression of leptin and reduced expression of adiponectin seems to be associated with advanced hepatic injury. New antifibrotic strategies are outlined. Ultimately, sustained virological response to hepatitis C therapy is associated with liver fibrosis regression in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection. "
692,0.005,1.0000,"In the past decade, the increased number of persons being treated for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has placed an enormous burden on specialty clinics. This is especially true in Los Angeles, where care of patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been termed a ""crisis"" situation. Especially in its early stages, HIV disease can be appropriately managed by primary care physicians who provide patients with medical and psychological counseling and refer them to specialists when major AIDS-related complications develop. Physicians completing their training as recently as 5 years ago, however, received little systematic preparation in the care of HIV-infected patients and thus may lack important skills such as the ability to recognize opportunistic infections early in their course. By means of a 1-week intensive preceptorship in a high-volume AIDS clinic, we are preparing community physicians to assume a more active role in providing care for this growing patient population. In the preceptorship, participants receive one-on-one training from specialists in infectious diseases, pulmonary diseases, and hematology and oncology, as well as from internists and family physicians. Evaluation of the clinical experience demonstrated a greater level of confidence on the part of program participants in treating HIV-infected patients and showed that participants screen and test high-risk patients in their practices and devote a substantial proportion of their practices to caring for HIV-infected patients."
8339,0.005,1.0000,"Serum immunoreactive erythropoietin (SIE) and hemoglobin levels were measured in 152 patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. Anemia was present in 18% of asymptomatic patients who tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus, 50% of patients with a condition related to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and 75% of patients with AIDS. The mean SIE level for untreated AIDS patients (26.2 +/- 2.4 mU/mL) was greater than for patients who tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus or patients with an AIDS-related condition but not outside the normal range for SIE (4 to 26 mU/mL), and the incremental increase in SIE level for a given decline in hemoglobin level was much less in AIDS patients than in patients with uncomplicated iron deficiency anemia. Forty-two patients were treated with zidovudine, and the hemoglobin level fell 10 g/L or more in 48%. In contrast to the untreated patients, however, the mean SIE level rose 10-fold to 214 mU/mL, and the incremental change in SIE level for a given decline in hemoglobin level was markedly increased. In the zidovudine-treated patients, erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume also rose significantly from a mean of 88.1 fL to 102 fL. However, in only 1 patient was there a corresponding increase in reticulocytes and in none was there amelioration of anemia. The data indicate that SIE level is inappropriately low in anemic AIDS patients. The ability of these patients to produce erythropoietin is intact and can be expressed with zidovudine therapy. However, even very high levels of SIE fail to stimulate erythropoiesis adequately."
3795,0.005,1.0000,"Cannabis is increasingly prescribed clinically and utilized by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to address symptoms of HIV disease and to manage side effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART). In light of concerns about the possibly deleterious effect of psychoactive drug use on adherence to ART, we sought to determine the relationship between high-intensity cannabis use and adherence to ART among a community-recruited cohort of HIV-positive illicit drug users. We used data from the ACCESS study, an ongoing prospective cohort study of HIV-seropositive illicit drug users linked to comprehensive ART dispensation records in a setting of universal no-cost HIV care. We estimated the relationship between at least daily cannabis use in the last 6 months, measured longitudinally, and the likelihood of optimal adherence to ART during the same period, using a multivariate linear mixed-effects model accounting for relevant socio-demographic, behavioral, clinical and structural factors. From May 2005 to May 2012, 523 HIV-positive illicit drug users were recruited and contributed 2,430 interviews. At baseline, 121 (23.1 %) participants reported at least daily cannabis use. In bivariate and multivariate analyses we did not observe an association between using cannabis at least daily and optimal adherence to prescribed HAART (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 1.12, 95 % Confidence Interval [95 % CI]: 0.76-1.64, p value = 0.555.) High-intensity cannabis use was not associated with adherence to ART. These findings suggest cannabis may be utilized by PLWHA for medicinal and recreational purposes without compromising effective adherence to ART."
17538,0.005,1.0000,"Abnormalities of thyroid function are associated with a number of systemic conditions, including patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Most patients with early HIV infection and a stable body weight have normal thyroid function. Subtle abnormalities of a number of thyroid function tests have been reported during the early asymptomatic phase of HIV disease. These include an inappropriately normal triiodothyronine (T(3)) and reduced reverse triiodothyronine (rT(3)), and increased thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Opportunistic infections involving the thyroid gland, neoplasms such as lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma, and medications can alter the thyroid function in individuals with more advanced HIV infection. If thyroid dysfunction is diagnosed in an HIV-infected patient, it should be treated in the usual manner. However, high index of suspicion and caution in the interpretation of thyroid function tests in patients with HIV disease are needed for optimal diagnosis and treatment."

Thirty patients were randomly assigned to either oxymetholone monotherapy (n 14) or oxymetholone plus ketotifen (n 16). Patients receiving treatment were compared with a group of thirty untreated matched controls, who met the same inclusion criteria. Body weight and the Karnofsky index, which assesses the ability to perform activities of daily life, and several quality-of-life variables were measured to evaluate response to therapy. The average weight gain at peak was 8.2 (SD 6.2) kg (+ 14.5% of body weight at study entry) in the oxymetholone group (P < 0.001), and 6.1 (SD 4.6) kg (+10.9%) in the combination group (P < 0.005), compared with an average weight loss of 1.8 (SD 0.7) kg in the untreated controls. The mean time to peak weight was 19.6 weeks in the monotherapy group and 20.8 weeks in the combination group. The Karnofsky index improved equally in both groups from 56% before to 67% after 20 weeks of treatment (P < 0.05). The quality of life variables (activities of daily life, and appetite/nutrition) improved in 68% (P < 0.05) and 91% (P < 0.01) of the treated patients respectively. Oxymetholone was safe and promoted weight gain in cachectic patients with advanced HIV-1 infection. The addition of ketotifen did not further support weight gain. These results suggest the need for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trial."
8741,0.005,1.0000,"Our objective was to assess the extent and risk factors for depression and poor physical health among patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We surveyed HCV-infected patients seen at four large healthcare systems participating in the Chronic Hepatitis Cohort Study (CHeCS). Survey data included demographics, depression and physical health measures, substance use history, current social support, recent stressor exposures, and, from the electronic medical record, treatment history, and Charlson Comorbidity Index scores. There were 4,781 respondents, who were a mean of 56.7 years old, 71% White, and 57% male. Altogether, 51.4% reported past injection drug use, 33.9% were current smokers, and 17.7% had abused alcohol in the previous year. Additionally, 47.4% had been previously treated for HCV and 14.8% had a 12-week sustained viral response (SVR) following HCV therapy. Overall, 29.7% of patients met criteria for current depression and 24.6% were in poor physical health. In multivariate analyses, significant predictors of depression and poor health included: male gender (versus female, odds ratios [ORs], 0.70 and 0.81), Black race (versus white, ORs, 0.60 and 0.61), having education less than high school (versus college, ORs, 1.81 and 1.54), being employed (versus not, ORs, 0.36 and 0.25), having high life stressors (versus low, ORs, 2.44 and 1.64), having low social support (versus high, ORs=2.78 and 1.40), and having high Charlson scores (versus none, ORs=1.58 and 2.12). Achieving a 12-week SVR was found to be protective for depression."
11477,0.005,1.0000,"We present a review of epidemiologic data collected by Projet RETRO-CI between 1987 and 1993 on trends in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 infections and on cases of AIDS in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. Overall rates of HIV infection in pregnant women had already reached 10% in 1987, and have increased only modestly since then. In contrast, in 1992-1993, rates in men with sexually transmitted diseases and in female commercial sex workers reached 27 and 86%, respectively. The increases in infection rates have been largely due to transmission of HIV-1, whereas rates of HIV-2 have remained stable or have declined. Among persons with tuberculosis and hospitalized patients, rates of 46-71% have been reached, increases in recent years again being largely attributable to HIV-1. Among the 15,245 AIDS cases reported by Projet RETRO-CI, a steady decline in the male:female sex ratio has occurred over time, from 4.8:1 in 1988 to 1.9:1 in 1993. It is likely that AIDS cases were initially concentrated among a core group of female commercial sex workers and their male clients. A substantial proportion of sex workers and their clients originate from neighboring countries, and migration is likely to have contributed to the spread of HIV infection in West Africa. Including HIV-associated pulmonary tuberculosis as an AIDS-defining illness increased AIDS cases reported by Projet RETRO-CI by 13% in 1993. Despite a need for interventional research, careful description of the evolution of HIV/AIDS in this region remains essential."
15803,0.005,1.0000,"Although reported rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and related risk behaviours among drug injectors vary considerably throughout the world, and comparison of findings is often hampered by methodological variability among centres. In 1989 the World Health Organization initiated a comparative study of current drug-injecting behaviour and HIV infection using a standardized methodology. Centres were asked to recruit at least half of their samples outside drug treatment settings in order to achieve as representative a group of injectors as possible. Respondents were interviewed using a questionnaire designed by an international working group, and they were asked to provide blood and/or saliva specimens for voluntary testing. Data from 13 centres (Athens, Bangkok, Berlin, Glasgow, London, Madrid, Naples, New York, Rome, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Sydney and Toronto) are reported here. A total of 6,390 injectors were recruited to the study from October 1989 to March 1992, with sample sizes ranging from 85 at Santos (Brazil) to 1,300 in New York. Weekly or daily sharing of injecting equipment was reported by less than a quarter of injectors in all centres. A high proportion of those sharing made some effort to clean equipment before use, although not always by efficient methods. In all centres, the majority of respondents were sexually active; however, rates of unprotected sexual intercourse were high, particularly between regular sexual partners. The overall HIV prevalence rate was 22 per cent, ranging from 0 per cent in Athens to 60 per cent in Santos. Caution should be exercised in postulating a link between HIV prevalence and current risk behaviour, particularly since injectors appear to behave in similar ways across a diverse range of study locations. This is the first report on an international collaborative study for which a large number of injectors were successfully recruited from a variety of settings. The wealth of data now available provides a greater understanding of the social epidemiology of drug injecting, which is essential for the implementation and evaluation of campaigns and interventions designed to limit the spread of HIV infection."
12790,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has infected approximately 170 million people worldwide. While the seroprevalence of anti-HCV antibody among Iranian blood donors is 0.13%, HCV infection is prevalent in 59-80% of Iranian injecting drug users. One hundred seventy-eight anti-HCV positive patients were referred to the Gastroenterology Department at the Taleghani Hospital (Tehran, Iran) between June 2007 and June 2012. Out of 178 samples, 142 were positive for HCV-RNA. HCV subtypes were determined using phylogenetic analysis of the NS5B or 5'UTR/core regions. Of 142 viremic patients, 71 (50%) were infected with HCV subtype 1a, 43 (30.3%) with subtype 3a, 20 (14.1%) with subtype 1b, 3 (2.1%) with subtype 4d, 2 (1.4%) with subtype 4a, 1 (0.7%) with subtype 2b, and 1 (0.7%) with subtype 6a. Interestingly, genetic analysis of a sub-genomic fragment from one patient identified a non-subtypeable HCV genotype-3 strain. There was a significant association between HCV subtype and a history of injecting drug use (P = 0.003). Subtype 3a was predominant among patients with such a history. Injecting drug use was associated with younger age (P < 0.001). HCV subtype was also significantly associated with a history of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (P = 0.02). Subtype 1a was more frequent among patients with such a history. In addition, history of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was significantly associated with older age (P = 0.002). In conclusion, while HCV subtype 1a is predominant among infected Iranian individuals, subtype 3a is predominant among Iranian injecting drug users."
17418,0.005,1.0000,"Recent reports suggest that a growing number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons show signs of persistent cognitive impairment even in the context of combination antiretroviral therapies (cART). The basis for this finding remains poorly understood as there are only a limited number of studies examining the relationship between CNS injury, measures of disease severity, and cognitive function in the setting of stable disease. This study examined the effects of HIV infection on cerebral white matter using quantitative morphometry of the midsagittal corpus callosum (CC) in 216 chronically infected participants from the multisite HIV Neuroimaging Consortium study currently receiving cART and 139 controls. All participants underwent MRI assessment, and HIV-infected subjects also underwent measures of cognitive function and disease severity. The midsagittal slice of the CC was quantified using two semi-automated procedures. Group comparisons were accomplished using ANOVA, and the relationship between CC morphometry and clinical covariates (current CD4, nadir CD4, plasma and CSF HIV RNA, duration of HIV infection, age, and ADC stage) was assessed using linear regression models. HIV-infected patients showed significant reductions in both the area and linear widths for several regions of the CC. Significant relationships were found with ADC stage and nadir CD4 cell count, but no other clinical variables. Despite effective treatment, significant and possibly irreversible structural loss of the white matter persists in the setting of chronic HIV disease. A history of advanced immune suppression is a strong predictor of this complication and suggests that antiretroviral intervention at earlier stages of infection may be warranted."
17299,0.005,1.0000,"The acceptance of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among patients and health care providers has had a dramatic impact on the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of many opportunistic infections associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Previously intractable opportunistic infections and syndromes are now far less common. In addition, effective antibiotic prophylactic therapies have had a profound impact on the risk of patients developing particular infections and on the incidence of these infections overall. Most notable among these are Pneumocystis carinii, disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex, tuberculosis, and toxoplasmosis. Nevertheless, infections continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality among patients who are infected with HIV. The role of HAART in many clinical situations is unquestioned. Compelling data from clinical trials support the use of these therapies during pregnancy to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV. HAART is also recommended for health care workers who have had a ""significant"" exposure to the blood of an HIV-infected patient. Both of these situations are discussed in detail in this article. In addition, although more controversial, increasing evidence supports the use of HAART during the acute HIV seroconversion syndrome. An ""immune reconstitution syndrome"" has been newly described for patients in the early phases of treatment with HAART who develop tuberculosis, M avium complex, and cytomegalovirus disease. Accumulating data support the use of hydroxyurea, an agent with a long history in the field of myeloproliferative disorders, for the treatment of HIV. Newer agents, particularly abacavir and adefovir dipivoxil, are available through expanded access protocols, and their roles are being defined and clarified."
17253,0.005,1.0000,"After two cases of acute hepatitis B infection occurred in phlebotomists at The Hospital for Sick Children in 1985, a seroprevalence survey of hepatitis B virus markers was undertaken. Directors in high-risk areas were advised by phone and memorandum to screen employees. Participation was entirely voluntary, and employees who did not respond were contacted six weeks after initial notification. Information obtained from each participant through a self-administered questionnaire included age, duration of employment in current pediatric occupation, history of blood transfusions, immune globulin prophylaxis, needlestick injury, and country of birth (North America/United Kingdom or other). Sera identified by code were tested by radioimmunoassay. Interactions were analyzed by using a multiple logistic regression model. A total of 10% of the personnel in high-risk areas, in which there was frequent exposure to blood or blood products, had hepatitis B markers in their blood, compared with 2% who did not have this exposure. Birthplace and occupation have independently significant effects on the likelihood of having hepatitis B markers. There appears to be an increased risk to employees in pediatric units, depending on the patient (and parent) population being served, although the risk may be lower than in adult hospitals."
13035,0.005,1.0000,"Identifying the functions of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific CD8+ T cells that are not merely modulated by the level of virus but clearly distinguish patients with immune control from those without such control is of paramount importance. Features of the HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell response in antiretroviral-treated patients (designated Rx <50) and untreated patients (long-term nonprogressors [LTNP]) matched for very low HIV RNA levels were comprehensively examined. The proliferative capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells was not restored in Rx <50 to the level observed in LTNP, even though HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell proliferation in the two patient groups was comparable. This diminished HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell proliferation in Rx <50 was primarily due to a smaller fraction of antigen-specific cells recruited to divide and not to the numbers of divisions that proliferating cells had undergone. Exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2) induced proliferating cells to divide further but did not rescue the majority of antigen-specific cells with defective proliferation. In addition, differences in HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell proliferation could not be attributed to differences in cellular subsets bearing a memory phenotype, IL-2 production, or PD-1 expression. Although polyfunctionality of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in Rx <50 was not restored to the levels observed in LTNP despite prolonged suppression of HIV RNA levels, per-cell cytotoxic capacity was the functional feature that most clearly distinguished the cells of LTNP from those of Rx <50. Taken together, these data suggest that there are selective qualitative abnormalities within the HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell compartment that persist under conditions of low levels of antigen."
9407,0.005,1.0000,"We describe a patient with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV) infection and alveolar echinococcosis (AE) with a focus on two messages. Despite being severely immunocompromised over years the patient exhibited a long-term asymptomatic course of AE. This is in clear contrast to reports describing accelerated courses of AE in immunocompromised patients. The patient had therapeutic mebendazole drug levels with only 1/10 of the normal drug dose. He was co-treated with protease inhibitors for his HIV infection. These drugs are known as strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)-dependent metabolism. We speculate that benzimidazoles and protease inhibitors interfere at the CYP3A4-level. The first report of co-infection of HIV and accelerated AE was in a young girl with an extremely low CD4 cell count and an abrogated lymphoproliferative responsiveness to parasite antigen stimulation. Since the CD4 cell count in our patient remained in the range of 27-150 cells/microl, we speculate that there was a critical threshold of immunosupression for constraining AE. Initial treatment with albendazole for AE added to the current highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART), and suppressive toxoplasmosis therapy became complicated by pancytopenia. After full recovery of the bone marrow, mebendazole was introduced with a new HAART and the previously prescribed toxoplasmosis maintenance therapy. Surprisingly, efficient mebendazole levels were achieved with an uncommonly low dose. These observations suggest that the benzimidazoles, albendazole and mebendazole, may interact with protease inhibitors, which are known for their strong inhibition of the CYP3A4."
1073,0.005,1.0000,"The lung is continuously exposed to infectious and non-infectious agents causing cell activation. Activated cells in the lung such as antigen-presenting cells which harbour HIV may favour this organ as a site for virus production. To test this hypothesis, cells from blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of HIV-infected patients and healthy controls were obtained and the activation of the cells were analysed by measuring the expression of IL-2 receptor, HLA-DR and VLA-1. The HIV-infected individuals were subdivided into 'lung symptomatic' or 'lung asymptomatic' patients, depending on the presence or absence of secondary lung diseases besides HIV. All HIV-infected individuals demonstrated a decreased number of CD4+ lymphocytes in blood; however, normal numbers of these cells were found in BAL. The activation state of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in blood and BAL was higher in lymphocytes from HIV-infected patients compared with controls. The activation state was highest in the lung symptomatic group. Lung symptomatic patients and lung asymptomatic patients with extrapulmonary infections had increased levels of free virus in plasma. Four out of four individuals without or with only low amounts of cell-free HIV in plasma belonged to the symptom-free subgroup. These results suggest that microorganisms other than HIV may promote viral replication via antigen-driven accumulation and activation of CD4+ cells in the lung or other organs, and thus may be responsible for the loss of helper T cells and the progression of the disease."
3472,0.005,1.0000,"18 men with longstanding human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigenaemia but no symptoms received zidovudine in low-dose regimens (250 mg 6-hourly, 500 mg 6-hourly, or 500 mg 12-hourly) with or without acyclovir. Serum HIV antigen rose in only 1 patient and declined significantly in 13 (to below cut-off values in 9). In the 1 subject from whom HIV antigen positive cerebrospinal fluid was obtained, the fluid was antigen negative after 12 weeks of treatment. Acyclovir treatment alone or in addition did not seem to influence serum antigen levels. In 7 untreated men serum antigen levels rose or remained stable during follow-up. CD4+ cell counts increased in 14/18 treated subjects and 1/7 untreated subjects. No disease progression was observed in either group. Regression of enlarged lymph nodes was seen in the zidovudine-treated subjects. Adverse reactions to the study drugs were infrequent and mild. Anaemia caused symptoms in 2, but serious leucopenia or neutropenia was not observed."
4969,0.005,1.0000,"In this study we investigated whether elevated levels of the inflammatory mediator granulocyte elastase in seminal plasma were associated with increased numbers of CD4+ T helper/inducer lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages in semen, the principal host cells of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Semen samples were obtained from 105 men attending an infertility clinic. CD4+ lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages and cells expressing the common leukocyte antigen (CD45) were identified by monoclonal antibodies (MAb's) in a biotinstreptavidin immunoperoxidase technique. Granulocyte elastase levels in seminal plasma were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In 17 men, granulocyte elastase levels were higher than 1000 ng/ml seminal plasma, indicating male genital tract inflammation. Compared to men with low/normal granulocyte elastase levels in semen (less than 250 ng/ml), these men showed significantly higher mean numbers of total leukocytes, CD4+ lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages in semen (P less than 0.001); median cell numbers for the group with high/inflammatory granulocyte elastase levels were increased 38-fold for total leukocytes (19,800,000 versus 520,625 per ejaculate), 19-fold for monocytes/macrophages (2,594,000 versus 134,565), and 6-fold for CD4+ lymphocytes (82,900 versus 14,100). Because of the increased numbers of potential HIV-host cells in inflammatory semen, male genital tract inflammation may be an important cofactor in the sexual transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus."
11940,0.005,1.0000,"The Th1--Th2 balance plays a pivotal role in determining the outcome of an immune response to an infectious organism. It is proposed that during HIV infection, disease progression is characterized by a loss of Th1 activity, a shift to a more 'allergic' Th2-type response and hence loss of cytotoxic cell activity against infected host cells. This study was undertaken to investigate this balance in three groups of individuals: HIV-negative volunteers (n=10), a group of HIV-infected patients on no therapy (n=10) as well as a group of patients managed with a mixture of plant sterols/sterolins (n=9). In parallel, their response to mitogens and the subsequent expression of the activation antigen CD69 was measured. This study was conducted by three-colour flow cytometry in order to obviate the less sensitive cytokine secretion assays that have yielded controversial results. The results indicate that HIV-infected patients on no therapy exhibit a pre-dominant Th2 response (IL-4 secretion), whereas those on the sterol/sterolin mixture exhibit a beneficial Th1 response (IFN-gamma). Surprisingly, in both patient groups, the expression of CD69 was abnormally low when compared to the uninfected volunteers, implying that chronic activation is already present in vivo. It appears that the detrimental Th2 driven response might be swung to the more beneficial Th1 response with the immune modulatory sterols/sterolin mixture. Clinical use of this mixture in HIV infection has yielded results which corroborate the above observations in that patients using the plant sterol/sterolin mixture maintain their CD4 cell numbers over an extended period of time in the absence of any anti-retroviral therapy."
7344,0.005,1.0000,"Serious adverse events and medication errors are common in clinical practice and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Management of HIV-positive patients is likely to become more complex as people age, developing multiple medical conditions and thus requiring polypharmacy. We undertook a casenote review and interview of patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) to audit the safety of devolving statin prescribing to general practitioners (GPs). Of 26 patients only 50% had their statin prescribing successfully been devolved to GPs. Many experienced significant difficulties and two of 26 (8%) were switched to simvastatin while receiving a protease inhibitor. We demonstrate that prescribing ART and non-ART medication by different practitioners on different sites can potentially expose patients to serious life-threatening adverse events. We make recommendations to minimize these risks and suggest that care pathways are reviewed to ensure they remain both convenient and user-friendly without compromising patient safety."
18860,0.005,1.0000,"HIV infection has experienced dramatic improvement in morbidity and mortality with the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This prompted a reevaluation of organ-solid transplantation as a treatment option for HIV-infected patients. Some trials in the United States have shown that one- and 2-year graft and patient survival is comparable to HIV-negative transplant population. In Europe the experience is still scarce. The aim of this study is to analyse the outcome and the clinical characteristics of HIV-infected patients who received kidney transplantation in Spain in the HAART era. Ten patients were transplanted in our country since 2001. Only one patient was black. The main cause of end-stage renal disease reported was glomerulonephritis. Six of the recipients were coinfected by hepatitis C virus. Inclusion criteria included undetectable HIV viral load and CD4 counts greater than 200/pL. Immunosuppression consisted of steroids, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, with antibody induction in 4 cases. The median and mean follow-up was 11 and 16.3+/-15.6 (3-46) months, respectively. One recipient lost his graft because of early renal venous thrombosis. The remaining patients are functioning graft with mean serum creatinina level of 1.5 +/- 0.5 mg/dl. Biopsy-proven acute rejection was diagnosed in 4 recipients and was reversed in all cases with antirejection treatment. The plasma HIV RNA levels have remained controlled and CD4 counts have been stable in excess of 200 cell/microL. None of patients have developed AIDS complications. Recipients receiving protease inhibitor-based HAART regimens required significant dosing modification to maintain appropriate tacrolimus levels. Our results show that renal transplantation can be a safe and effective treatment in select HIV-infected patients. Like other series, the acute rejection rate was higher than in non-HIV recipients. The reasons of this rejection incidence remain unknown."
18584,0.005,1.0000,"Clinical outcomes in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with hepatitis B virus (HBV) have not been thoroughly evaluated. Here, we investigated recent posttransplant clinical outcomes of KTRs with HBV and compared them with KTRs with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and seronegative KTRs.Of 3855 KTRs from April 1999 to December 2011, we enrolled 3482 KTRs who had viral hepatitis serology data; the patients were followed up for 89.1 ± 54.1 months. The numbers of recipients with HBV and HCV were 160 (4.6%) and 55 (1.6%), respectively. We analyzed the clinical outcomes, including overall mortality and graft failure, among patients who had undergone kidney transplantation.Patients with HBV showed poorer survival (P = 0.019; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.370; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.155-4.865) than KTRs without HBV. However, the graft survival of patients with chronic hepatitis B did not differ from that of patients without HBV. Hepatic complications were the primary causes of mortality of KTRs with HBV. Mortality significantly correlated with a higher grade of inflammation (P = 0.002) and with the use of lamivudine or adefovir antiviral treatment (P = 0.016). HBV-positive KTRs treated with the new-generation antiviral agent entecavir showed improved patient survival compared with KTRs receiving lamivudine (log-rank P = 0.050). HCV did not affect patient survival; however, it increased the incidence of graft failure (P = 0.010; adjusted HR = 2.899; 95% CI: 1.289-6.519). KTRs with HCV had an increased incidence of acute rejection (log-rank P = 0.005, crude HR = 2.144; 95% CI: 1.341-3.426; P = 0.001).KTRs with chronic hepatitis B may exhibit poor survival due to post-transplantation hepatic complications. Pretransplant histological liver evaluations and adequate antiviral management with potent nucleoside/nucleotide analogues are needed to improve the survival of KTRs with chronic hepatitis B even when liver function is within the normal range.

3276,0.005,1.0000,"This study assessed the association of HIV RNA with indirect markers of liver injury including FIB-4 index, liver enzymes and platelet counts in a high-risk Hispanic population. The data were derived from a prospective study that included 138 HIV/hepatitis C (HCV)-coinfected and 68 HIV-infected participants without hepatitis C or B co-infection (mono-infected). In unadjusted analyses, detectable HIV viral load (vs undetectable, <400 copies/mL) was associated with a 40% greater odds (OR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.9, P = 0.016) of FIB-4 > 1.45 in the HIV/HCV-coinfected group and 70% greater odds of FIB-4 > 1.45 (OR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0-2.8; P = 0.046) in the HIV-mono-infected group. In multivariable analyses, a 1 log(10) increase in HIV RNA was associated with a median increase in FIB-4 of 12% in the HIV/HCV-coinfected group and 11% in the HIV-mono-infected group (P < 0.0001). Among the HIV/HCV-coinfected group, the elevating effect of HIV RNA on FIB-4 was strongest at low CD4 counts (P = 0.0037). Among the HIV-mono-infected group, the association between HIV RNA and FIB-4 was independent of CD4 cell counts. HIV RNA was associated with alterations in both liver enzymes and platelet counts. HIV antiretroviral therapy was not associated with any measure of liver injury examined. This study suggests that HIV may have direct, injurious effects on the liver and that HIV viral load should be considered when these indirect markers are used to assess liver function."

A cross-section study was performed in 495 individuals treated at a public center in the city of Goiânia. Participants were interviewed and blood collected for evaluation of serological and molecular markers for HBV and HCV. The rate of exposure to HBV was 33.5% (95% CI 29.4-37.9). Nineteen patients (3.8%) were diagnosed as HBV carriers, of whom 68.4% were HBV DNA positive. The prevalence of anti-HCV was 9.7% (95% CI 7.3-12.7). Genotype 1a was identified in 72.7% of the PCR samples positive for HCV. Co-infection by all three viruses was 4.4% (95% CI 2.9-6.8). Being, male, aged ≥40 years, history of sexually transmitted disease (STD), and having homosexual practices were independently associated with the presence of markers of HBV exposure. A history of injectable drugs use and STDs showed association with HCV seropositivity. Approximately 50% of participants were not aware of their HBV and HCV serostatus. The results obtained may contribute to assess the burden of viral hepatitis in people living with HIV and to guiding preventive measures for more vulnerable groups. "
15642,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study is to explore the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among injection drug users (IDUs) with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in southern Taiwan. For 562 IDUs (265 anti-HIV negative, 297 anti-HIV positive), we analyzed liver function, anti-HIV antibody, anti-HCV antibody, HCV viral loads, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). HIV RNA viral loads and CD4 cell count for anti-HIV-seropositive IDUs and the HCV genotype for HCV RNA-seropositive IDUs were measured. The seroprevalence rates of anti-HIV, anti-HCV, and HBsAg were 52.8%, 91.3%, and 15.3%, respectively. All the anti-HIV-seropositive IDUs were positive for HIV RNA. Anti-HCV seropositivity was the most important factor associated with HIV infection (odds ratio [OR], 25.06; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 8.97-74.9), followed by male gender (OR, 6.12; 95% CI, 4.05-9.39) and HBsAg seropositivity (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.11-3.34). Among IDUs positive for anti-HCV, 80.7% had detectable HCV RNA. HCV viremia after HCV exposure was strongly related to HIV infection (OR, 6.262; 95% CI, 1.515-18.28), but negatively correlated to HBsAg seropositivity (OR, 0.161; 95% CI, 0.082-0.317). HCV genotype 6 was the most prevalent genotype among all IDUs (41.0%), followed by genotypes 1 (32.3%), 3 (12.8%), and 2 (5.6%). In conclusion, about half IDUs were infected with HIV and >90% with HCV infection. Male and seropositivity for HBsAg and anti-HCV were factors related to HIV infection among our IDUs. HIV was positively correlated, whereas hepatitis B co-infection was negatively correlated with HCV viremia among IDUs with HCV exposure. Different HCV molecular epidemiology was noted among IDUs."
8854,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with substantial clinical and economic burden and is an important public health issue in Asia. The objective of this review was to characterize HCV epidemiology and related complications in China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. A search of electronic databases and conference abstracts identified 71 potentially relevant articles. Of those, 55 were included in the epidemiology review and 9 in the review of HCV-related complications. HCV prevalence in the general population was 1.6% in China, 0.6-0.9% in Japan, 0.6-1.1% in South Korea and 1.8-5.5% in Taiwan. Prevalence was higher for injecting drug users (48-90%) and those with human immunodeficiency virus coinfection (32-85%) and was lower for blood donors (<1%). Annual incidence of HCV in China was 6.01 per 100,000. HCV genotype 1b was associated with the highest incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Five-year survival for patients with liver cirrhosis was 73.8%, decreasing to 39.2% following liver transplantation; the majority of deaths were attributable to HCC. Limitations were that the majority of studies included in the epidemiology review were small, regional studies conducted in specific populations, and there was an absence of large population-based studies. Thus, estimates may not be representative of the epidemiology of HCV for each country. The prevalence HCV in China and HCV incidence in the Asian region remain largely unknown, and they are likely underestimated. Further epidemiologic and clinical data are needed to provide more precise estimates for use by public health agencies."

Phylogenetic clustering and associated factors were evaluated among PWID in Vancouver, Canada. Data were derived from the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study. Participants who were HCV antibody-positive at enrolment and those with HCV antibody seroconversion during follow-up (1996 to 2012) were tested for HCV RNA and sequenced (Core-E2 region). Phylogenetic trees were inferred using maximum likelihood analysis and clusters were identified using ClusterPicker (90% bootstrap threshold, 0.05 genetic distance threshold). Factors associated with clustering were assessed using logistic regression. Among 655 eligible participants, HCV genotype prevalence was: G1a: 48% (n=313), G1b: 6% (n=41), G2a: 3% (n=20), G2b: 7% (n=46), G3a: 33% (n=213), G4a: <1% (n=4), G6a: 1% (n=8), G6e: <1% (n=1), and unclassifiable: 1% (n=9).

Factors independently associated with phylogenetic clustering included: age <40 (versus age≥40, adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03, 2.63), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (AOR=1.82; 95% CI 1.18, 2.81), HCV seroconversion (AOR=3.05; 95% CI 1.40, 6.66), and recent syringe borrowing (AOR 1.59; 95% CI 1.07, 2.36)."
16017,0.005,1.0000,"The pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome has not been elucidated completely. Many findings in these patients are identical to those with immune thrombocytopenic purpura. However, recent findings in acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients including the effect of zidovudine on platelet count and the demonstration of ultrastructural changes and viral RNA in megakaryocytes, have suggested that the human immunodeficiency virus may directly infect megakaryocytes, and play a role in acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related thrombocytopenia. To investigate further the mechanism of decreased platelet counts in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, the platelet volume-number relationship and corresponding bone marrow findings in 34 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus were studied. Parameters evaluated included platelet count and mean platelet volume; bone marrow cellularity, megakaryocyte number, and number and percentage of denuded megakaryocyte nuclei. Two thirds of the platelet counts were low, and of these 92% had an inappropriately low mean platelet volume. These individuals had a platelet-volume number relationship that is very similar to that seen in myelosuppressive disorders. In addition, more than 90% of the bone marrows from thrombocytopenic patients had either normal or decreased numbers of megakaryocytes. These observations provide additional evidence to support the hypothesis that the pathophysiology of human immunodeficiency virus-associated thrombocytopenia may be due, at least in part, to a direct effect on the megakaryocytes."

All were asymptomatic and had absolute CD4 cell count >100/microL (range, 137-301) and <10,000 copies/mL of human immunodeficiency virus RNA (range, <500-1250). A bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood were obtained for mycobacterial culture. Follow-up blood cultures were obtained routinely at 4 weeks and every 8 weeks thereafter. All 4 patients had negative bone marrow and blood cultures and then discontinued antimycobacterial therapy. All patients' subsequent cultures remain sterile and all are clinically asymptomatic (range, 8-13 months follow-up). It appears that disseminated MAC infection can be cured by prolonged antimycobacterial therapy in some persons who experience sustained CD4 lymphocyte increases while receiving HAART."

All these blood components were further tested for anti-HCV using a second-generation RIBA and for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction. Recipient sera were tested for HCV RNA prior to and following blood component infusion. Blood components from four donors were positive for HCV RNA. All recipients of HCV RNA-positive blood components became viremic on the first day tested post-infusion. In addition, two recipients of HCV RNA-negative blood components tested HCV RNA-positive both pre- and post-infusion. Viremia persisted up to the time of death or day 100 in five of the six patients who were HCV RNA-positive post-transplant. No HCV RNA-positive recipient developed symptomatic acute hepatitis, and only two had aminotransferase elevations consistent with chronic hepatitis. We conclude that HCV RNA-positivity in blood components accurately predicts transmission of virus. Infection with HCV did not adversely affect short-term patient outcome following bone marrow transplantation."

Compared to 260 concurrent HIV-infected controls, at risk when cases were diagnosed, patients with AVN had lower CD4 cell count nadirs (median 86.5 versus 137.5 cells/microl, p = 0.010) and suffered significantly more often from Pneumocystis pneumonia, cerebral toxoplasmosis, CMV retinitis, and atypical mycobacteriosis and had a significantly higher body mass index than controls. Duration of ART before AVN was not significantly different between cases and controls (2.92 versus 2.17 years, p = 0.30). In conclusion, AVN could not be attributed to time on antiretroviral treatment, but patients with AVN had histories of more severe immunosuppression and a higher body mass index than controls."

Insulin sensitivity did not decrease in the first 24 weeks, but a trend toward a decrease appeared at week 48. Six subjects experienced onset or worsening of glucose tolerance by week 24. Levels of fasting triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol increased. Bone mineral content, lean tissue, total fat, trunk fat, limb fat, and the ratio of trunk to limb fat increased at week 48. Amprenavir-based therapy was associated with increases in serum lipid levels but no short-term decrease in insulin sensitivity. A trend toward insulin resistance appeared late in the study following weight gain, particularly of trunk fat, but without loss of limb fat."

All patients had a low blood lymphocyte CD4 count (1-130, mean 15/mm3) and ten met the diagnostic criteria for AIDS. The 12 patients had pulmonary symptoms (dyspnea, cough) and fever. On chest X-ray, nodular, interstitial or diffuse parenchymal infiltrates, mediastinal and hilar adenopathies were observed. Two patients had pleural effusion, but none had cavitary lung disease. Mk was isolated by culture of sputum (n = 7), blood (n = 3), bronchial biopsy (n = 2) or bone marrow (n = 1). No patient had clinical extra-pulmonary disease. Survival after diagnosis was in average 7 months. Potential for therapeutic response is reviewed and documented."
659,0.005,1.0000,"A nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone is a recommended component of standard highly active antiretroviral therapy (sHAART). However, long-term NRTI exposure can be limited by toxicities. NRTI class-sparing alternatives are warranted in select patient populations. This is a 48-week single-center, open-label pilot study in which 60 HIV-infected adults with plasma HIV-1 RNA (<50 copies/ml) on sHAART were randomized (2:1) to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) 400/100 mg BID+raltegravir (RAL) 400 mg BID switch (LPV-r/RAL arm) or to continue on sHAART. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HIV-RNA<50 copies/ml at week 48. Secondary efficacy and immunologic and safety endpoints were evaluated. Demographics and baseline lipid profile were similar across arms. Mean entry CD4 T cell count was 493 cells/mm(3). At week 48, 92% [95% confidence interval (CI): 83-100%] of the LPV-r/RAL arm and 88% (95% CI: 75-100%) of the sHAART arm had HIV-RNA<50 copies/ml (p=0.70). Lipid profile (mean ± SEM, mg/dl, LPV-r/RAL vs. sHAART) at week 24 was total-cholesterol 194 ± 5 vs. 176 ± 9 (p=0.07), triglycerides 234 ± 30 vs. 133 ± 27 (p=0.003), and LDL-cholesterol 121 ± 6 vs. 110 ± 8 (p=0.27). There were no serious adverse events (AEs) in either arm. Regimen change occurred in three LPV-r/RAL subjects (n=1, due to LPV-r/RAL-related AEs) vs. 0 in sHAART. There were no differences between arms in bone mineral density, total body fat composition, creatinine clearance, or CD4 T cell counts at week 48. In virologically suppressed patients on HAART, switching therapy to the NRTI-sparing LPV-r/RAL combination produced similar sustained virologic suppression and immunologic profile as sHAART. AEs were comparable between arms, but the LPV-r/RAL arm experienced higher triglyceridemia."

Data were available for 155 (99%) patients. Statistical analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Median follow-up was 28 months and 30 months for control and IL-2 patients, respectively. Twenty-five (16%) patients developed AIDS or died during follow-up (16 control patients vs. 9 IL-2 patients; R2=0.57; P=.22). Mean change from baseline CD4 cell count was significantly higher in patients randomized to receive IL-2 (368 vs. 153 cells/microL; P=.003). Mean change from baseline plasma HIV RNA was significantly lower in patients randomized to receive IL-2 (-0.98 vs. -0.63 log copies/mL; P=.004).

19423,0.005,1.0000,"Major histocompatibility class I-peptide tetramer technology and simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac)-infected rhesus monkeys were used to clarify the distribution of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in secondary lymphoid organs and to assess the relationship between these CTL and the extent of viral replication in the various anatomic compartments. SIVmac Gag epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells were evaluated in the spleen, bone marrow, tonsils, thymus, and 5 different lymph node compartments of 4 SIVmac-infected rhesus monkeys. The average percentage of CD8(+) T lymphocytes that bound this tetramer in all the different lymph node compartments was similar to that in peripheral blood lymphocytes in individual monkeys. The percentage of CD8(+) T cells that bound the tetramer in the thymus was uniformly low in the monkeys. However, the percentage of CD8(+) T cells that bound the tetramer in bone marrow and spleen was consistently higher than that seen in lymph nodes and peripheral blood. The phenotypic profile of the tetramer-binding CD8(+) T lymphocytes in the different lymphoid compartments was similar, showing a high expression of activation-associated adhesion molecules and a low level expression of naive T-cell-associated molecules. Surprisingly, no correlation was evident between the percentage of tetramer-binding CD8(+) T lymphocytes and the magnitude of the cell-associated SIV RNA level in each lymphoid compartment of individual monkeys. These studies suggest that a dynamic process of trafficking may obscure the tendency of CTL to localize in particular regional lymph nodes or that some lymphoid organs may provide milieus that are particularly conducive to CTL expansion.

Data from 26 referral centres, corresponding to 1769 patients with chronic hepatitis C were collected consecutively during a 6-month period. HCV genotyping in the 5'-non-coding region (NCR) was performed in each center using the line probe assay (LiPA, in 63% of cases), sequencing (25%) or primer-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (12%). HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, non-subtyped 1 and mixed infection were found in 18, 27, 9, 21, 9, 3, 11 and 1% of our population, respectively. HCV genotype distribution was associated with gender, age, source and duration of infection, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, cirrhosis, alcohol consumption, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. In multivariate analysis, only the source of infection was the independent factor significantly associated with genotype (P = 0.0001). In conclusion, this study shows a changing pattern of HCV genotypes in France, with i.v. drug abuse as the major risk factor, an increase of genotype 4, and to a lesser extent 1a and 5, and a decrease of genotypes 1b and 2. The modification of the HCV genotype pattern in France in the next 10 years may require new therapeutic strategies, and further survey studies."
10278,0.005,1.0000,"We tested the hypothesis that increases in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) induced by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are associated with the increases in slow-wave sleep seen in early HIV infection and the decrease with sleep fragmentation seen in advanced HIV infection. Nocturnal sleep disturbances and associated fatigue contribute to the disability of HIV infection. TNF-alpha causes fatigue in clinical use and promotes slow-wave sleep in animal models. With slow progress toward a vaccine and weak effects from current therapies, efforts are directed toward extending productive life of HIV-infected individuals and shortening the duration of disability in terminal illness. We describe previously unrecognized nocturnal cyclic variations in plasma levels of TNF-alpha in all subjects. In 6 of 10 subjects (1 control subject, 3 HIV-seropositive patients with CD4+ cell number > 400 cells per microliters, and 2 HIV-positive patients with CD4+ cell number < 400 cells per microliters), these fluctuations in TNF-alpha were coupled to the known rhythm of electroencephalogram delta amplitude (square root of power) during sleep. This coupling was not present in 3 HIV-positive subjects with CD4+ cell number < 400 cells per microliters and 1 control subject. In 5 HIV subjects with abnormally low CD4+ cell counts ( < 400 cells per microliters), the number of days since seroconversion correlated significantly with low correlation between TNF-alpha and delta amplitude. We conclude that a previously unrecognized normal, physiological coupling exists between TNF-alpha and delta amplitude during sleep and that the lessened likelihood of this coupling in progressive HIV infection may be important in understanding fatigue-related symptoms and disabilities."
13089,0.005,1.0000,"The recent elucidation of the life cycle and dynamics of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and technological advances in development of the HIV RNA PCR assay for sensitive detection of viral load have revolutionized the diagnosis, management, and treatment of HIV infection. Beginning with initial infection, there is unremitting, high-level viral replication that persists throughout the course of HIV infection. The measure of the amount of virus present in plasma, HIV viral load, is the single most important predictor of HIV progression, the best indicator of immune system decline, and the best guide for initiating and monitoring antiviral treatment. Further, HIV viral load has become the new yardstick against which other markers, including CD4 number, age, chemokine receptor mutations, cytotoxic T-cell responses, and neutralizing antibody titers are assessed. For individuals with haemophilia, additional 'markers' may have significant impact on the outcome of HIV disease. Chronic factor concentrate treatment has led to transfusion-associated hepatitis, co-infection with hepatitis C (HCV), and chronic liver disease. The latter may become accelerated with HIV progression and may lead to hepatotoxicity with antiviral drug therapy. Chronic factor concentrate treatment has also been associated with immunosuppression, including both B- and T-cell immune defects. In HIV(+) haemophilic men, this immune deficit has led to lower CD4 counts with HIV progression and poorer CD4 response to antiviral drugs than in gay men. The underlying haemophilic bleeding tendency may result in significant haemorrhage with HIV-associated immune thrombocytopenia and with protease inhibitor antiretroviral therapy. Although AIDS is the leading cause of death in this group, the reduction in the size of the haemophilia population over the next two centuries is estimated to be small, and survival should improve as better antiviral therapeutics are identified."
1653,0.005,1.0000,"A new human retrovirus was isolated from a continuous cell line derived from a patient with CD4+ Tac- cutaneous T cell lymphoma/leukemia. This virus is related to but distinct from human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus types I and II (HTLV-I and HTLV-II) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). With the use of a fragment of provirus cloned from one patient with T cell leukemia, closely related sequences were found in DNA of the cell line and of tumor cells from seven other patients with the same disease; these sequences were only distantly related to HTLV-I. The phenotype of the cells and the clinical course of the disease were clearly distinguishable from leukemia associated with HTLV-I. All patients and the wife of one patient showed a weak serological cross-reactivity with both HTLV-I and HIV-1 antigens. None of the patients proved to be at any apparent risk for HIV-1 infection. The name proposed for this virus is HTLV-V, and the date indicate that it may be a primary etiological factor in the major group of cutaneous T cell lymphomas/leukemias, including the sporadic lymphomas known as mycoses fungoides."
12904,0.005,1.0000,"There is growing literature on the subject of aneurysmal degeneration of arteries in patients who are infected with HIV. A patient recently seen at our medical center with an aneurysm of the carotid artery stimulated our interest in reviewing the mechanisms by which HIV may initiate or predispose to these pathologies. There are at least three major possibilities: (1) immunodeficiency allows bacteria that are known to cause mycotic aneurysms to proliferate without immune restraint; (2) one or more of the HIV envelope proteins sufficiently resemble one or more artery-specific-antigenic proteins (ASAPs) that may trigger an autoimmune response (molecular mimicry); and (3) the HIV virus itself infects arterial-resident cells that maintain the integrity of the load-bearing matrix. The computational searches reported here suggest that the ASAP, matrix cell adhesion molecule-1 (Mat-CAM-1), has a high degree of similarity to known ligands for HIV envelope proteins gp41 and gp120. No similarities of Mat-CAM-1 to the HIV envelope glycoproteins were detected. Accordingly, among the possibilities for explaining the HIV/aneurysm connection, direct infection of aortic fibroblasts by the HIV virus is more likely to be the pathogenetic mechanism than the process of molecular mimicry."
9499,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcription is subject to substantial fluctuation during the viral life cycle. Due to the low frequencies of HIV-1-infected cells, and because latently and productively infected cells collocate in vivo, little quantitative knowledge has been attained about the range of in vivo HIV-1 transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). By combining cell sorting, terminal dilution of intact cells, and highly sensitive, patient-specific PCR assays, we divided PBMC obtained from HIV-1-infected patients according to their degree of viral transcription activity and their cellular phenotype. Regardless of a patient's treatment status, the bulk of infected cells exhibited a CD4+ phenotype but transcribed HIV-1 provirus at low levels, presumably insufficient for virion production. Furthermore, the expression of activation markers on the surface of these CD4+ T lymphocytes showed little or no association with enhancement of viral transcription. In contrast, HIV-infected T lymphocytes of a CD4-/CD8- phenotype, occurring exclusively in untreated patients, exhibited elevated viral transcription rates. This cell type harbored a substantial proportion of all HIV RNA+ cells and intracellular viral RNAs and the majority of cell-associated virus particles. In conjunction with the observation that the HIV quasispecies in CD4+ and CD4-)/CD8- T cells were phylogenetically closely related, these findings provide evidence that CD4 expression is downmodulated during the transition to productive infection in vivo. The abundance of viral RNA in CD4-/CD8- T cells from viremic patients and the almost complete absence of viral DNA and RNA in this cell type during antiretroviral treatment identify HIV+ CD4-/CD8 T cells as the major cell type harboring productive infection in peripheral blood."
2725,0.005,1.0000,"Natural progression of HIV-1 infection depends on genetic variation in the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I locus, and the CD8+ T cell response is thought to be a primary mechanism of this effect. However, polymorphism within the MHC may also alter innate immune activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by changing interactions of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules with leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILR), a group of immunoregulatory receptors mainly expressed on myelomonocytic cells including dendritic cells (DCs). We used previously characterized HLA allotype-specific binding capacities of LILRB1 and LILRB2 as well as data from a large cohort of HIV-1-infected individuals (N = 5126) to test whether LILR-HLA class I interactions influence viral load in HIV-1 infection. Our analyses in persons of European descent, the largest ethnic group examined, show that the effect of HLA-B alleles on HIV-1 control correlates with the binding strength between corresponding HLA-B allotypes and LILRB2 (p = 10(-2)). Moreover, overall binding strength of LILRB2 to classical HLA class I allotypes, defined by the HLA-A/B/C genotypes in each patient, positively associates with viral replication in the absence of therapy in patients of both European (p = 10(-11)-10(-9)) and African (p = 10(-5)-10(-3)) descent. This effect appears to be driven by variations in LILRB2 binding affinities to HLA-B and is independent of individual class I allelic effects that are not related to the LILRB2 function. Correspondingly, in vitro experiments suggest that strong LILRB2-HLA binding negatively affects antigen-presenting properties of DCs. Thus, we propose an impact of LILRB2 on HIV-1 disease outcomes through altered regulation of DCs by LILRB2-HLA engagement."
222,0.005,1.0000,"The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is more than 60 times higher than in matched controls. In the vast majority of cases aggressive pathological subtypes and advanced stages prevail, extranodal sites are involved and systemic symptoms are present. The prognosis of HIV-NHL remains poor and the optimal therapeutic approach has yet to be defined. We report a 48-year-old Ethiopian woman with advanced-stage HIV infection, who developed diffuse large cell, immunoblastic type B-cell NHL and was treated with a modified CHOP-like chemotherapy combined with Rituximab and supported with growth factor. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and opportunistic infections prophylaxis were administered concomitantly. The patient completed 6 cycles of therapy and currently, 76 weeks after diagnosis, is in complete clinical remission. Despite the fact that there was a transient decrease in the CD4-positive cell number and a 1.5 log increase in plasma viral load there were no opportunistic infections, nor was life-threatening toxicity seen. Rituximab seems a well-tolerable and advantageous adjunct to chemotherapy and HAART in the treatment of aggressive HIV-associated NHL andshould be investigated in large trials in the future."
17536,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of the brain causes a complex cascade of cellular events involving several different cell types that eventually leads to neuronal cell death and the manifestation of the AIDS-associated dementia complex (ADC). Upon autopsy HIV-infected individuals show lesions within subcortical regions of the brain, including the cerebellum. Previously we have demonstrated, in primary and cell culture models of rat and human astrocytes, a change in intracellular pH (pH(i)) due to increased Na(+)/H(+) exchange following exposure to inactivated virus or gp120, the major HIV envelope glycoprotein. To further investigate whether any such in vivo pH(i) changes occur in human brains subsequent to HIV infection, we measured the pH(i) of the cerebellum in eight HIV-positive individuals and nine healthy volunteers using (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) at high field strength (4.1 T). The results showed a significant difference between the age-adjusted mean pH(i) in the cerebellum in control group and patient groups (7.11 +/- 0.03 vs 7.16 +/- 0.04), and further HIV-infected individuals displayed a significant increase in the number of cerebellar volume elements that were alkaline. We hypothesize that this propensity towards alterations in cerebellar pH(i) may portend later neurological involvement resulting from HIV infection."
18001,0.005,1.0000,"Some gender differences in the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been attributed to delayed treatment among women and the social context of poverty. Recent economic difficulties have led to multiple service cuts, highlighting the need to identify factors with the most influence on health in order to prioritize scarce resources. The aim of this study was to empirically rank factors that longitudinally impact the health status of HIV-infected homeless and unstably housed women. Study participants were recruited between 2002 and 2008 from community-based venues in San Francisco, California, and followed over time; marginal structural models and targeted variable importance were used to rank factors by their influence. In adjusted analysis, the factor with the strongest effect on overall mental health was unmet subsistence needs (i.e., food, hygiene, and shelter needs), followed by poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy, not having a close friend, and the use of crack cocaine. Factors with the strongest effects on physical health and gynecologic symptoms followed similar patterns. Within this population, an inability to meet basic subsistence needs has at least as much of an effect on overall health as adherence to antiretroviral therapy, suggesting that advances in HIV medicine will not fully benefit indigent women until their subsistence needs are met."
5415,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is critical for reducing HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality. Food insecurity (FI) is emerging as an important barrier to adherence to care and treatment recommendations for people living with HIV (PLHIV), but this relationship has not been comprehensively examined. Therefore, we reviewed the literature to explore how FI may impact ART adherence, retention in medical care, and adherence to health care recommendations among PLHIV. We found data to support FI as a critical barrier to adherence to ART and to other health care recommendations among HIV-infected adults, HIV-infected pregnant women and their HIV-exposed infants, and child and adolescent populations of PLHIV. Associations between FI and ART non-adherence were seen in qualitative and quantitative studies. We identified a number of mechanisms to explain how food insecurity and ART non-adherence may be causally linked, including the exacerbation of hunger or ART side effects in the absence of adequate food and competing resource demands. Interventions that address FI may improve adherence to care and treatment recommendations for PLHIV. "
1389,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to assess the predictors of the receipt of a disability grant (DG) status and the impact of the DG on health outcomes of HIV patients and on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a longitudinal study over 20 months in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Consecutive patients, 735 (29.8% males and 70.2% females), who attended three HIV clinics completed the assessments (with a structured questionnaire and medical file review) prior to antiretroviral initiation, 519 after 6 months, 557 after 12 months and 499 after 20 months on ART. The results indicate that a large number of HIV or ART patients were found to be in receipt of a DG, which declined significantly over the time of being on ART (from 52.3% at 6 months on ART to 9.8% at 20 months on ART). At various stages, being in receipt of a DG was found to be associated with not being employed, higher quality of life (QoL), older age, higher alcohol use score, no formal salary as household income and higher subjective health status in multivariable analyses. A significant number of patients lost their DG status over the assessment period, which was not found to be associated with major health outcomes (CD4 cell counts, adherence to ART and HIV symptoms). In a multiple regression generalized estimating equation model, not being in receipt of a DG, health-related QoL, lower HIV symptoms and lower depression scores were associated with CD4 counts. HIV patients who no longer qualify for the DG and yet do not have adequate financial means to meet basic necessities should be put on a nutritional support programme."
1068,0.005,1.0000,"HIV is a chronic, life-threatening illness that necessitates regular and consistent medical care. Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a common experience among HIV-positive adults and may interfere with treatment utilization. This study examined rates and correlates of treatment utilization among HIV-positive adults with CSA enrolled in a coping intervention trial in New York City. The baseline assessment included measures of treatment utilization, mental health, substance abuse, and other psychosocial factors. In 2002-2004, participants (50% female, 69% African-American, M = 42.3 +/- 6.8 years old) were recruited. Nearly all (99%) received HIV medical care. However, 20% had no outpatient visits and 24% sought emergency services in the past 4 months. Among 184 participants receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), 22% were less than 90% adherent in the past week. In a multivariable logistic regression model, no outpatient treatment was associated with African American race (AOR = 3.46 [1.42-8.40]), poor social support (AOR = 1.59 [1.03-2.45]), and abstinence from illicit drug use (AOR = 0.37 [0.16-0.85]). Emergency service utilization was associated with HIV symptoms (AOR = 2.30 [1.22-4.35]), binge drinking (AOR=2.92 (1.18-7.24)), and illicit drug use (AOR = 1.98 [1.02-3.85]). Poor medication adherence was associated with trauma symptoms (AOR = 2.64 [1.07-6.75]) and poor social support (AOR = 1.82 [1.09-2.97]). In sum, while participants had access to HIV medical care, a sizable minority did not adhere to recommended guidelines and thus may not be benefiting optimally from treatment. Interventions targeting HIV-positive adults with CSA histories may need to address trauma symptoms, substance abuse, and poor social support that interfere with medical treatment utilization and adherence."
13220,0.005,1.0000,"Use of herbal medicines among patients receiving Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) remains by far an uncharacterised phenomenon in Africa and Uganda specifically. We evaluated the use of herbal medicines among patients on ART at the HIV clinic of Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH), examined factors associated with their concomitant use and their impact on ART adherence. This was a cross-sectional study among 334 systematically sampled patients receiving ART at the HIV clinic of MRRH from February to April 2010. We collected data on patient demographics, clinical characteristics, perceptions of quality of care received, self-perceived health status, information on ART received, herbal medicines use and ART adherence. Study outcomes were concomitant herbal medicine and ART use, and ART adherence. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were conducted using Stata10.0. Close to half, 155 (46.4%) reported concomitant herbal medicines and ART use, with 133 (39.8%) using herbal medicines at least once daily. Most (71.6%) used herbal medicines to treat HIV-related symptoms. A majority (92.3%) reported that the doctors were unaware of their use of herbal medicines, 68.5% citing its minimal importance to the attending physician. Most frequently used herbs were Aloe vera (25%) and Vernonia amygdalina (21%). Time since start of ART (OR 1.14 95% CI: 1.01-1.28, for each one year increase), number of ART side effects reported (≥3 vs.≤1, OR 2.20 95% CI 1.13-4.26) and self-perceived health status (Good vs. Poor, OR 0.31 95% CI 0.12-0.79) were independently associated with concomitant herbal medicine and ART use. Concomitant herbal medicine and ART use was not associated with poor ART adherence (OR 0.85 95% CI 0.47-1.53). There is widespread concomitant herbal medicines and ART use among our patients, with no association to poor ART adherence.

4407,0.005,1.0000,"A peer-driven intervention (PDI) was developed to support uptake and adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among women sex workers who use illicit substances in Vancouver, because uptake and adherence continues to be suboptimal. Trends of adherence were examined among women in this program by (1) exposure to the intervention and (2) risk behaviors including drug use and unstable housing. Between January 2007 and January 2008, 20 HIV-positive women were enrolled into the PDI on a rolling basis. PDI participation included weekly peer support meetings, a health advocate (buddy) system, peer outreach service, and onsite nursing care. Adherence was measured directly with pharmacy records (PR) and indirectly with self-report and viral load (VL) outcomes. Participants attended an average of 50 (21-70) PDI meetings. Overall self-reported adherence was high (92%) and most women (11) reported increased adherence from the first to the last 13 PDI meetings attended (average increase = 18%). The number of viral load tests <or=50 copies/mL increased by 40% from the pre-PDI period (1 year before enrollment), to the PDI period (duration enrolled). PR adherence and improvements in VL outcomes were higher among participants with greater housing instability and frequency of injecting/smoking drugs. Despite a very difficult environment to provide HIV care, there is evidence to suggest that the PDI may have had a positive impact on adherence outcomes. Although this would not predict long-term treatment success, the PDI approach to HIV treatment support is a promising program for women who might otherwise be excluded from treatment altogether."

Blood samples were drawn from 98 intravenous drug users (IVDU), 100 female high-class commercial sex workers (CSW) and 50 male outpatients (MOP) at a sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic in Chiang Mai, Thailand. These blood samples were analyzed for GBV-C/HGV RNA; antibodies against second envelope protein of GBV-C/HGV (anti-E2); anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV-Ab); hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb); and antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-Ab). Prevalences of GBV-C/HGV RNA, anti-E2, HCV-Ab, HBcAb and HIV-Ab were 27.6%, 16.3%, 84.7%, 76.5% and 45.0% in IVDU; 0%, 21.5%, 2.0%, 72.0% and 11.0% in CSW; 6.0%, 13.6%, 0%, 64.0% and 14.0% in MOP. While the prevalence of GBV-C/HGV RNA was higher in IVDU than in CSW and MOP, comparable prevalences of anti-E2 among the three populations were found. Intravenous drug injection showed association with GBV-C/HGV RNA, while history of STD associated with anti-E2. In conclusion, intravenous drug injection and STD were found to be risk factors for the previous exposure to GBV-C/HGV, but STD did not increase the risk of the GBV-C/HGV viraemia."

These findings supplement existing evidence that STDs increase the likelihood of HIV transmission."
1954,0.005,1.0000,"Individuals with syphilis have higher chance of having HIV, and syphilis' genital ulcers increases HIV transmission rate. Nevertheless, there are few well-documented studies about HIV and syphilis co-infection and its risk factors. The study was based on 2262 HIV infected individuals from South Brazilian HIV cohort, which began in 1991, and this analysis included individuals who were included in the cohort until November 2008. Inclusion criteria were having CD4 + T cell count and viral load at baseline, and syphilis serology tests (venereal disease research laboratory [VDRL] > 1:64 or a positive VDRL plus a positive treponemal test). A total of 1012 patients were included; 580 were men (57%); mean age at HIV diagnosis was 33 years; 591 (58%) had previous diagnosis of AIDS; most of the individuals acquired HIV from sexual contact (47.9% heterosexual and 31.7% men who had sex with men [MSM]); and 759 (75%) were on antiretroviral therapy. The prevalence of syphilis was 20.5% (208). After multivariate analysis, being male (2.01; 95% CI, 1.23-3.27; p = 0.005) and MSM (1.91; 95% CI, 1.25-2.90; p = 0.002) were significantly associated to HIV and syphilis co-infection. Males and MSM were associated with higher risk of this co-infection. Our findings may reflect that this particular population is still engaging in unprotected sexual intercourse, and efforts should be made to better target this specific group as they might perpetuate these infections."
5492,0.005,1.0000,"Although the primary mode of hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission is exposure to blood products or injection drug use (IDU), studies have found varying independent risk factors for HCV infection among persons with no history of IDU or exposure to blood products. For HIV-infected women, sexual transmission may be another potential source of HCV infection. HIV-infected and HIV-negative women at risk for HIV enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) during October 1994 to November 1995 and again between October 2001 and November 2002 were studied. Clinical and demographic factors associated with HCV seroprevalence were assessed in multivariate logistic regression models controlling for history of blood transfusion and IDU. Among 3636 women with HCV results, 31.5% were HCV antibody positive (HCV+) including 13.5% with no reported history of IDU or blood transfusions. Multivariate logistic regression analyses stratified on IDU showed that among women with no history of IDU, sex with an IDU male was independently associated with HCV positivity (odds ratio [OR] = 2.8, 95% confidence [CI] = 2.1, 3.8, p < 0.0001) after controlling for blood transfusion, age, HIV infection, unemployment, birth in the United States, history of hepatitis B infection, and current smoking status. Further stratification on HIV status showed that the association was significant only for the HIV+ (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.3, 2.7, p = 0.0007) compared to the HIV- women (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.4, 2.7) although these odds ratios were not significantly different (p = 0.25). For HIV-positive women with no reported history of IDU, sex with an IDU male was independently associated with HCV suggesting that sexual transmission may be an important mode of HCV transmission for these high-risk women."
7336,0.005,1.0000,"A non-blinded randomized controlled trial evaluated efficacy of pharmaceutical care (PC) (Dáder method) on self-reported antiretroviral adherence and undetectable plasma viral load (UPVL), compared with usual care (UC) in HIV-positive patients in Brazil. Most were male (63 %), mean age 40.3 years (SD = 10). After 12 months, 79.8 % of those receiving PC versus 73.8 % in UC were adherent (RR 1.05, 95 % CI 0.95-1.15, P = 0.35), and 50.3 versus 49.8 % (PC vs. UC, respectively) had UPVL (RR 1.08, 95 % CI 0.97-1.20, P = 0.15). Factors associated with self-reported adherence were regular employment, UPVL, no depressive symptoms, and lower pill load in the treatment regimen. Older age, education, CD4 count <200 cells/mm(3), and shorter treatment duration were associated with UPVL. Of 94 reported drug-related problems, 43 % resolved. In subgroup analyses of patients who experienced therapeutic failure and who were non-adherent at the beginning of the trial (N = 50), no differences were found in UPVL (HR 1.35, 95 % CI 0.57-3.19). Only education level (>12 years) was independently predictive of viral suppression (HR 7.47, 95 % CI 1.69-32.91). In conclusion, PC was not associated with increased self-reported adherence to ART or UPVL in patients treated at a health care facility in southern Brazil. The study suggests, however, that PC could be effective for the subgroup of patients with poor adherence. "
19539,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has markedly improved HIV disease management, and significantly reduced HIV/AIDS-associated morbidity and mortality. Although recent studies suggest a relationship between smoking and suboptimal adherence to ART, a more in-depth understanding of this relationship is needed. We conducted a secondary analysis using data from a randomized controlled smoking cessation trial to investigate the association of nonadherence to ART with potential demographic, psychosocial (perceived stress and depression), and substance use (nicotine dependence, illicit drug use, and alcohol use) variables among persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who smoke. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of participants (n=326) was 45.9 years old (SD=7.6). Additionally, the majority were male (72.1%), self-identified as black (76.7%), and reported sexual contact as the mode of HIV acquisition (70%). Unadjusted logistic regression analysis indicated that depression (odds ratio [OR]=1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.00, 1.04), illicit drug use (OR=2.39; 95% CI=1.51, 3.79) and alcohol use (OR=2.86; 95%CI=1.79, 4.57) were associated with nonadherence. Adjusted logistic regression analysis indicated that nicotine dependence (OR=1.13; 95% CI=1.02, 1.25), illicit drug use (OR=2.10; 95% CI=1.27, 3.49), alcohol use (OR=2.50; 95% CI=1.52, 4.12), and age (OR=1.04; 95% CI=1.00, 1.07) were associated with nonadherence. Nicotine dependence, illicit drug use, and alcohol use are potentially formidable barriers to ART adherence among PLWHA who smoke. Future efforts should investigate the complex relationships among these variables to improve adherence particularly among populations confronted with multifaceted health challenges."
19556,0.005,1.0000,"Women in prison have a higher prevalence of HIV than men. After release from prison, former inmates have the opportunity to engage in risk behaviors for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We sought to assess change in risk behaviors over time and the association of gender with risk behavior in the postrelease period. In this prospective cohort study, we interviewed 200 former inmates (51 women) approximately two weeks (baseline) and three months (follow-up) after release and tested them for HIV infection at follow-up. We examined the association of gender with unprotected vaginal or anal sex in the last seven days using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests and multivariable logistic regression. At baseline, 22% of men and 41% of women reported unprotected vaginal sex (p < 0.01) and 5% of men and 8% of women reported unprotected anal sex (p = 0.51). Being younger (OR for each decade increase 0.48, 95% CI = 0.29-0.80), being gay/lesbian or being bisexual (compared with being heterosexual, OR = 4.74, 95% CI = 1.01-22.17 and OR = 3.98, 95% CI = 1.41-11.26, respectively), or reporting a drug of choice of heroin/speedballs or cocaine/crack (compared with marijuana/no drug of choice, OR = 24.00, 95% CI = 5.15-111.81 and OR = 3.49, 95% CI = 1.20-10.18, respectively) was associated with unprotected vaginal or anal sex after adjusting for race, homelessness, and hazardous drinking. At follow-up, 21% of men and 44% of women reported unprotected sex (p = 0.005), and female gender (OR = 4.42, 95% CI = 1.79-10.94) and hazardous drinking (compared with not meeting criteria for hazardous drinking, OR = 3.64, 95% CI = 1.34-9.86) were associated with unprotected sex, adjusting for race and homelessness. In this population with a high prevalence of HIV, we demonstrated persistent engagement in sexual risk behavior during the postrelease period. Enhanced efforts to promote sexual health and reduced risk behavior among both male and female current and former prison inmates are needed, including improved access to preventive care and HIV and STI screening, testing, and treatment."
18504,0.005,1.0000,"From among 2,375 young men, examined by doctors, 111 tattooed subjects were found. Twenty one subjects reported engaging in promiscuous sexual behavior or being intravenous drug abusers, and so were excluded. The other 90 were evaluated. To make up the control group, 180 non-tattooed subjects from the remaining 2,264, who neither engaged in promiscuous sexual activity nor were intravenous drug abusers, were matched from household registry reports by age, sex, education, occupation, and geographic origin from Mainland China, where their parents were born. IgG antibody of hepatitis A (anti-HAV) and markers of hepatitis B were tested in serum with radioimmunoassay. In the prevalence rate of hepatitis A and carrier rate of HBsAg there were no differences between the tattooed and the non-tattooed groups. However, the prevalence odds ratio of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection for the tattooed group was 8.1 (95% CI 1.9-34.8) as compared to the non-tattooed groups. Moreover, there was a trend correlation when the prevalence rates of hepatitis B were compared for the group with multiple sites of tattoos, for the group with one site of tattoos, and for the non-tattooed group (p = 0.002). These findings suggested an association between HBV infection and tattooing. Tattoo exposure, with improper or no sterilization of the needle, seems to appear to increase the risk of HBV infection in the already high risk endemic area in question."
11968,0.005,1.0000,"The municipality of Londrina ranks second in the number of AIDS cases in the state of Paraná, Brazil, with the Ministry of Health notified of 1070 cases from 1984 to 2002. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors for HTLV-1/2 infection in HIV-infected patients attending the AIDS Reference Center serving Londrina (and surrounding region), Paraná, Brazil. Data concerning sociodemographic conditions and risk factors were collected from 784 HIV-infected patients, using a questionnaire. Blood samples were obtained from 758 of the patients and subjected to serologic screening tests for the determination of HTLV-1/2, as well as hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and syphilis. Most patients were white (mean age, 35.9 years); 55.9% were males and 44.1% were females. The most frequent sexually transmitted disease was gonorrhea (28.5%), followed by syphilis (14.3%) and condyloma (12.2%). The major risk factors associated with the acquisition of retroviruses were sexual contact (84.8%) and intravenous drug use (IDU, 11.9%). The overall infection seroprevalence was 6.4% for HTLV-1/2, 37.2% for HBV, 21.0% for HCV, and 24.4% for syphilis. HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infections were confirmed in 0.8 and 4.9% of patients, respectively. HIV/HTLV-1/2 coinfection was more frequent in IDUs (59.2% of cases) and was strongly associated with HCV (22.60 [95% CI, 10.35-49.35]). A weak association with HBV (2.09 [95% CI, 1.13-3.90]) and no association with syphilis were observed. The results showed that human retroviruses are circulating in southern Brazil, mainly among white people of both genders of low socioeconomic conditions and educational level. Although the sexual route was considered to be the major risk factor for HIV infection, HTLV-1/2 infection was strongly associated with IDU."
8188,0.005,1.0000,"In this cross-sectional survey conducted at the end of 1997 among the physicians of participants of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS), 1487 of 2154 patients (69.0%) were treated with highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) defined as triple therapy with a combination of one or two reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and one or two protease inhibitors; 541 patients (25.1%) had never received such treatment. The physician's perception that the patient would not comply with treatment was one reason for not prescribing HAART to 20% of these patients (110). Physicians indicated that the most common reasons for the patient to refuse HAART were the fear of side effects (18%) and the patient's perception that treatment was too complicated (18%). Among 126 patients (5.8%) no longer receiving HAART, the most common reasons for discontinuing treatment were actual side effects (61%) or the fear of side effects (25%). Overall, 16% of patients did not receive therapy in accord with official Swiss guidelines. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that patients with lower education, active intravenous drug users outside of a drug substitution program, and those who acquired HIV infection through intravenous drug use had a significantly higher risk of inadequate treatment. The physician's judgment of patient adherence and the physician's perception of the patient's fear of side effects are critical for the prescription of HAART. Physicians should address these issues to prevent unilateral withholding of treatment and increase the proportion of patients who may benefit from current antiretroviral therapy."
12251,0.005,1.0000,"Sexual contact is the major mode of HIV transmission. Increased sexual risk taking has been described in HIV-infected individuals receiving potent antiretroviral therapy. A new questionnaire on sexual behavior was introduced into the Swiss HIV Cohort Study on April 1, 2000. We evaluated sexual behavior in all individuals who completed the questionnaire for the first time within 1 year after its introduction. Our primary hypothesis was that self-reported unsafe sexual behavior would be more prevalent among individuals with optimal viral suppression. On April 1, 2000, 4948 individuals were registered in the study, and 4723 (95%) completed the questionnaire. Of these individuals, 12% reported unsafe sex, 78% received antiretroviral therapy, and 25% had optimal viral suppression (HIV RNA level always <50 copies/mL during the preceding 12 months). During the preceding 6 months, 55% of individuals had stable and 19% had occasional partners, and 6% had both types of partners. Sexual intercourse was reported by 82% of individuals with stable and 87% of individuals with occasional partners, and of those reporting sexual intercourse in each group, 76% and 86%, respectively, said that they always used condoms. After adjustment for covariates, reported unsafe sex was not associated with optimal viral suppression (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.33) or antiretroviral therapy (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.07), but it was associated with gender, age, ethnicity, HIV transmission group, HIV status of partner, having occasional partners, and living alone. There is no evidence that self-reported unsafe sexual behavior is more prevalent among HIV-infected individuals with optimal viral suppression. However, unsafe sex is associated with other factors."
17113,0.005,1.0000,"Local genital tract inflammation stimulates leukocyte activity and causes HIV shedding, potentially increasing HIV sexual infectiousness. Although there are available clinical markers for genital tract inflammation, such as urinary leukocyte esterase, none have yet been examined in relation to HIV sexual risk behaviours. We sought to examine the association between urinary leukocyte esterase and sexual practices. Sexually active men living with HIV and receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART, N = 290) provided urine specimens and completed behavioural health assessments. HIV RNA tests and CD4 cell counts were abstracted from medical records. Urine specimens were analysed for leukocyte esterase using a standard point-of-care dipstick test. Thirty-one (10.6%) participants tested positive for leukocyte esterase. Logistic regression models did not indicate differences between men with elevated and un-elevated leukocyte activity on demographic, health, recent sexually transmitted infection symptoms and diagnoses or substance use. However, men with elevated leukocyte activity indicated significantly greater sexual behaviour in the previous three months, including more recent unprotected sexual intercourse. A simple over-the-counter urine test may serve as an indicator of sexual HIV infectiousness to inform further evaluation and treatment of genital tract inflammation, as well as condom use decisions during times of increased genital tract inflammation.

8151,0.005,1.0000,"This study investigates the association of avascular necrosis (AVN) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals with possible risk factors, including antiretroviral therapy. Clinic records of all AVN cases diagnosed up to July 2009 in HIV-positive patients attending North Middlesex Hospital, London, UK were retrospectively reviewed. For each case, one control was randomly selected, matched for gender, age, nadir CD4 count and date of HIV diagnosis. Of 15 symptomatic AVN cases identified, eight were in women. Univariate analysis demonstrated significant associations between AVN and a history of systemic steroid use (p = 0.004) and cumulative exposure to protease inhibitor (p = 0.03). Physicians should be aware of the risk of AVN with steroid use, the importance of early diagnosis and avoidance of other risk factors in order to prevent further joint involvement if possible."
6681,0.005,1.0000,"Some ambulant people with HIV are cared for primarily by their general practitioner and some in an outpatient clinic. Costs and patterns of care in these settings were studied in 65 such patients based in Zürich, from a limited societal perspective (excluding patient costs) based on medical resource use. Antiretroviral therapy (ART), other medications and patient variables were collected prospectively, and non-medication resources (professional time and investigations) and treatment history data were collected from medical records and by record linkage to the Swiss HIV Cohort Study database. Cost differences between the settings were estimated using multiple regression, controlling for differences in case-mix. ART comprised 80% of the total cost, non-medication costs 15% and non-ART medications 5%. Total costs were higher in the outpatient clinic (estimated additional cost after controlling for case-mix = 3489 Swiss Francs per year at 1999 prices, 95% confidence interval 742 to 6236, p=0.017). The difference was accounted for by higher ART costs in the outpatient clinic, not through a tendency to use more expensive drugs or higher doses but rather through the use of more drugs concurrently. Differences in ART prescribing patterns between the doctors in the outpatient clinic and the general practitioners were considerable and appear worthy of further investigation."

Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection attending secondary and tertiary care centres in Switzerland. One thousand six hundred and forty-five patients with HCV infection were followed up for a mean of over 2 years. We calculated all-cause standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using age, sex and calendar year-specific Swiss all-cause mortality rates. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to model the variability of SMR by cirrhotic status, HCV genotype, infection with hepatitis B virus or HIV, injection drug use and alcohol intake. Sixty-one deaths were recorded out of 1645 participants. The crude all-cause SMR was 4.5 (95% CI: 3.5-5.8). Patients co-infected with HIV had a crude SMR of 20 (95% CI: 11.1-36.1). The SMR of 1.1 (95% CI: 0.63-2.03) for patients who were not cirrhotic, not infected with HBV or HIV, did not inject drugs, were not heavy alcohol consumers (<or=40 g/day) and were not genotype 3, indicated no strong evidence of excess mortality. We found little evidence of excess mortality in hepatitis C infected patients who were not cirrhotic, in the absence of selected risk factors. Our findings emphasize the importance of providing appropriate preventive advice, such as counselling to avoid alcohol intake, in those infected with HCV."

This study recruited sexually-active, HIV-infected patients in Brazil, Thailand, and Zambia to examine correlates of ART nonadherence and 'amplified HIV transmission risk'. Lower alcohol use (OR = .71, p < .01) and higher health-related quality of life (OR = 1.10, p < .01) were associated with greater odds of ART adherence over and above region. Of those with viral load data available (in Brazil and Thailand only), 40 % met Swiss criteria for infectiousness, and 29 % had 'amplified HIV transmission risk.' MSM had almost three-fold (OR = 2.89, p < .001) increased odds of 'amplified HIV transmission risk' (vs. heterosexual men) over and above region. TasP efforts should consider psychosocial and contextual needs, particularly among MSM with detectable viremia."
16332,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), discovered as causative viruses of post-transfusion hepatitis, become persistent infections, leading to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For HCV, recent IFN-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies have increased sustained virological response (SVR) rates and reduced adverse events. IFN-based therapies, still the standard of care in Asian countries, are influenced by IL28B genetic variants and the liver fibrosis stage, but the DAA combinations obscure the influence of these factors. These new therapies can eradicate HCV and prevent HCC development. On the other hand, it is difficult to eradicate HBV completely. Although HBV infection can be prevented by vaccination, reactivation of HBV following anti-cancer chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy is a well-known complication. HBV reactivation has been reported to be associated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab-containing chemotherapy and TNF-α inhibitor-containing immunosuppressive therapy in HBV-resolved patients. Our prospective observational study revealed that monthly monitoring of HBV DNA was useful for preventing HBV reactivation-related hepatitis among B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients with resolved HBV infection following rituximab-steroid-chemo, suggesting that preemptive therapy guided by serial HBV DNA monitoring should be recommended. Recently, highly sensitive HBsAg detection by Lumipulse HBsAg-HQ may be useful for several clinical applications. The sensitivity of this assay (5 mIU/mL) was approximately 10-fold higher than Abbott ARCHITECT, but still lower than HBV-DNA assays. The convenient HBsAg-HQ may be useful for detecting occult HBV infection and HBV reactivation in relatively low-risk groups except for those receiving rituximab-steroid-chemo. ["

We sought to characterize immune correlates associated with host protection in this population. Previous studies have demonstrated an association of peripheral eosinophilia with resistance to reinfection with schistosomes. Thus, we investigated the relationship between the percentage of circulating eosinophils and the effect of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coinfection on the susceptibility of the car washers to reinfection with schistosomes. Elevated percentages of circulating eosinophils were associated with resistance to reinfection by S. mansoni in HIV-1-seronegative persons. In the HIV-1-seropositive cohort, low CD4+-T-cell counts were associated with a less intense eosinophilia. Moreover, eosinophils from the car washers expressed high levels of FcepsilonRI beta chain, a molecule important in immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated immunity. Levels of FcepsilonRI beta chain expression correlated with serum levels of total and antigen-specific IgE for HIV-1-negative car washers, but this was not the case for individuals coinfected with HIV-1. Overall, these data further implicate eosinophils as having a potential role in development of protective immunity against schistosomes and suggest that changes associated with HIV-1 coinfection increase susceptibility to reinfection."

We examined correlates of HIV treatment in the largest sample of PLWHA transitioning through jail in 10 US sites from 2007 to 2011. Cocaine, alcohol, cannabis, and heroin were the most commonly used substances. Drug use severity was negatively and independently correlated with three outcomes just before incarceration: (1) having an HIV care provider (AOR = 0.28; 95 % CI 0.09-0.89); (2) being prescribed antiretroviral therapy (AOR = 0.12; 95 % CI 0.04-0.35) and (3) high levels (>95 %) of antiretroviral medication adherence (AOR = 0.18; 95 % CI 0.05-0.62). Demographic, medical and psychiatric comorbidity, and social factors also contributed to poor outcomes.

Efavirenz levels and HIV-1 RNA levels were measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of 10 HIV-1-infected patients taking efavirenz, 600 mg daily, in combination with other antiretroviral medications. Efavirenz was detected in the CSF at a mean concentration of 35.1 nM (range, 6. 6-58.9 nM), which was above the IC95 for wild-type HIV-1. The mean CSF-to-plasma ratio was 0.61% (range, 0.26%-0.99%). CSF HIV-1 RNA levels were ascertained in 9 of the patients; all were <400 copies/mL after a mean of 26 weeks on therapy. Eight of the 9 patients had no detectable virus in plasma. These results indicate that efavirenz is present in the CSF at low levels and is effective in suppressing CSF viral levels when used in combination therapy."

However, chronic pain, depression, and substance use, all of which are prevalent in this population, can reduce the quality of patient-provider engagement. We hypothesized a model in which chronic pain, depression, and substance use would be associated with poorer patient-provider engagement, which would be positively associated with adherence, with the latter associated positively with viral suppression. We analyzed data from the BEACON study, which included surveys from 383 PLHIV who were primarily African American, on ART, and had histories of drug use. Due to six missing cases on the chronic pain variable, we used data from 377 respondents in a structural equation model. Chronic pain and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with poorer patient-provider engagement, while substance use was associated with better engagement. Patient-provider engagement in turn was associated with better ART adherence, which was associated with higher viral suppression. Results suggest the role of chronic pain in poor patient-physician engagement in this population, which has potential implications for quality of HIV patient care and health outcomes. Findings suggest the need for attention to patient-provider engagement in PLHIV."
5513,0.005,1.0000,"Aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/Plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance in virologically suppressed individuals presenting with incident neurologic symptoms.In this retrospective cohort study conducted between March 1, 2009, and March 1, 2017, HIV-1 infected adults exposed to atleast 12 months of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and having plasma viral load (VL) <1000 copies/mL (virologically suppressed) were included. Among these, individuals presenting with neurologic symptoms during follow-up were assessed for CSF/Plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance by measuring HIV-1 RNA in collected plasma and CSF samples. CSF/plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance was defined as either detectable CSF HIV-1 RNA (VL > 20 copies/mL) with an undetectable plasma RNA (complete viral suppression, VL ≤20 copies/mL) or CSF HIV-1 RNA ≥ 0.5 log10 higher than plasma RNA when plasma VL was between 20 and 1000 copies/mL (low-level viremia, LLV).Out of 1584 virologically suppressed patients, 71 (4.4%) presented with incident neurologic symptoms. Twenty out of 71 (28.2%) patients were diagnosed with CSF/Plasma HIV-1 discordance. Median plasma and CSF VL in patients with discordance was 120 [interquartile range (IQR): <20 to 332.5] and 4250 (IQR: 2550.0- 9615.0) copies/mL, respectively. All 9 individuals in which CSF HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing was done showed mutations that would compromise efficacy of prescribed ART regimen. Prevalence of CSF/plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance was higher among neurologically symptomatic patients with plasma LLV as compared with those with complete viral suppression (70% vs 11.8%, P < .001). The risk of discordance was also greater in patients who received protease inhibitor (PI) containing ART (P < .001) and those on ART regimens with central nervous system (CNS) penetration effectiveness (CPE) value <6 (P = .006).CSF/plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance indicates replication of HIV-1 that has adapted to the CNS or has developed antiretroviral drug resistance. Larger studies should be performed to study incidence of discordance in India. This will help in managing patients presenting with neurologic symptoms on suppressive ART with appropriate neuroeffective therapy."

We investigated the long-term virologic outcome and the development of resistance after initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in drug-naive patients in daily clinical practice. Twenty-five treatment-naive HIV-1 patients were started on HAART. Fifteen patients responded with a drop in viral load below the limit of detection during 35.5 (interquartile range: 7) months of therapy. In 6 of 10 patients with virologic failure, virus with resistance-related mutations against the received drugs emerged. Compared with responders (R), nonresponding (NR) patients were in a later disease stage at therapy start (p = 0.0089) with lower CD4 cell counts at baseline (p = 0.040), and a lower proportion of nonresponders showed protease inhibitor (PI) levels above C(min) (p = 0.049). More NR patients showed secondary PI mutations at baseline (p = 0.079), and the CCR2-64I coreceptor polymorphism was absent among NR patients, compared with 38.5% of R patients displaying CCR2-64I (p = 0.053), although the differences were not significant. In conclusion, starting HAART in antiretroviral drug-naive HIV-infected patients followed in daily clinical practice prevented viral breakthrough for up to 44 months in 60% of the patients. Virologic failure was associated with the development of resistance-related mutations, a later stage of disease at start of therapy and lower PI drug levels."
4905,0.005,1.0000,"Since the late 1990s, the epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Taiwan has expanded dramatically. Pediatric HIV infection has also increased at an alarming pace. Nearly 40% of the HIV-infected children (<10 years) contracted infection through mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of interventions to prevent MTCT of HIV infection, and to describe the clinical and immunologic characteristics of children born to HIV-seropositive mothers in southern Taiwan. From 1995 to 2003, an observational, longitudinal study of 8 children born to HIV-infected mothers was carried out at a tertiary care university hospital. The median age at enrollment was 0.4 years (range, 1 day-7.5 years), and the mean duration of follow-up was 2.7 years. Four mothers were immigrants from southeastern Asia. Due to antenatal diagnosis of maternal HIV infection, 3 children underwent interventions, including cesarean section, prophylactic use of zidovudine, and bottle-feeding in order to prevent vertical transmission. Five children were born without interventions because of delayed diagnosis of maternal HIV infection. During follow-up, 2 children were found to be HIV-infected and 6 were not infected. The rate of MTCT was lower among patients with interventions (0% vs 40%). In HIV-exposed/non-infected children, the clinical and immunologic assessments were normal during follow-up. Both HIV-infected children progressed to the stage of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Early identification of HIV-seropositive pregnant women, implementations to reduce vertical transmission, and introduction of antiretroviral therapy permit optimism in the prevention and treatment of pediatric HIV infection."
3418,0.005,1.0000,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is still a underinvestigated central nervous system infection, often linked to HIV-related immunodeficiency. We present an unusual case report characterized by motor involvement, which occurred as the first AIDS-defining event in the absence of appreciable immunodeficiency in a patient with previously undiagnosed HIV infection, who was also assessed by a functional-metabolic magnetic resonance imaging technique (MRI-spectrometry). A 45-year-old patient had HIV infection detected after the appearance of motor abnormalities, in the absence of other signs or symptoms. No significant immunodeficiency was found (initial CD4+ lymphocyte count of 566 cells/µL), and HIV viral load was 24,000 RNA copies/mL. Combination antiretroviral therapy was started with lamivudine, abacavir and lopinavir/ritonavir, with subsequent addition of efavirenz and enfuvirtide. Elevated cerebrospinal fluid levels of JC virus (JCV) (11,668 copies/µL) and consistent neuroradiological findings at contrast-enhanced computed tomography and MRI scans confirmed a diagnosis of PML. Despite the aggressive therapeutic approach, which achieved undetectable HIV viraemia, a CD4+ count above 700 cells/µL and disappearance of JCV after 20 days, the neurological motor involvement rapidly deteriorated, yet associated cognitive impairment never occurred. Clinical and neuroradiological deterioration occurred, and our patient died five months after the diagnosis due to respiratory failure. Combined MRI-spectrometry studies performed 10 days before death included proton ((1)H) spectrometry, and an MRI study-calculation of water diffusion and anisotropy: through this innovative technique combining morphological and metabolic findings, multiple abnormalities involving the subtentorial white matter were detected (with multiple encephalic trunk and ponto-bulbar lesions), which usually are not part of the PML course."
18374,0.005,1.0000,"The clinical course and laboratory evaluation of 21 patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Ehrlichia chaffeensis or Ehrlichia ewingii are reviewed and summarized, including 13 cases of ehrlichiosis caused by E. chaffeensis, 4 caused by E. ewingii, and 4 caused by either E. chaffeensis or E. ewingii. Twenty patients were male, and the median CD4(+) T lymphocyte count was 137 cells/microL. Exposures to infecting ticks were linked to recreational pursuits, occupations, and peridomestic activities. For 8 patients, a diagnosis of ehrlichiosis was not considered until > or =4 days after presentation. Severe manifestations occurred more frequently among patients infected with E. chaffeensis than they did among patients infected with E. ewingii, and all 6 deaths were caused by E. chaffeensis. Ehrlichiosis may be a life-threatening illness in HIV-infected persons, and the influence of multiple factors, including recent changes in the epidemiology and medical management of HIV infection, may increase the frequency with which ehrlichioses occur in this patient cohort."
5731,0.005,1.0000,"The frequency of syphilis has been increasing during the past 5 years primarily among men who have sex with men, many of whom are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Data on treatment options other than intravenous or intramuscular penicillin for syphilis are very limited. We describe two HIV-infected patients with asymptomatic neurosyphilis who were successfully treated with oral doxycycline. The first patient was a 45-year-old Hispanic man with well-suppressed HIV RNA who had a positive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) titer of 1:128. His cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) revealed a positive VDRL titer of 1:16, and an elevated white blood cell count of 96 cells/mm(3) and protein level of 89 mg/dl. He received high-dose doxycycline 200 mg twice/day for 28 days. Two months later, his CSF VDRL titer, white blood cell count, and protein level decreased to 1:4, 5 cells/mm(3), and 60 mg/dl, respectively. The second patient was a 37-year-old Caucasian man with complications from acquired immunodeficiency disease. A routine VDRL titer was found to be 1:64. Although the CSF VDRL was nonreactive, both his white blood cell count and protein level were elevated at 29 cells/mm(3) and 46 mg/dl, respectively. High-dose doxycycline 200 mg twice/day was prescribed for 28 days. Three months later, the patient's VDRL titer decreased to 1:2; his CSF white blood cell count decreased significantly to 1 cell/mm(3), and his protein level was within normal limits. Clinicians should be aware that an extended course of high-dose, oral doxycycline may be an effective and safe alternative regimen to intravenous or intramuscular penicillin, without requiring hospitalization or home health care, for the treatment of neurosyphilis in HIV-infected patients. Prospective trials are needed to assess the long-term efficacy oral doxycycline for neurosyphilis."
9443,0.005,1.0000,"Without potent antiretroviral therapy, most human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected persons experience a progressive decline in CD4+ T cells and impairment in T helper function. It is unclear how soon after infection T cell dysfunction occurs. T helper responses were examined in blood and lymphoid tissue of 39 untreated patients with acute HIV-1 infection. Within the first 3 months, lymphoproliferative responses to mitogen, recall antigens, and HIV-1 antigens were impaired. After 6-9 months, responses to phytohemagglutinin and recall antigens improved. However, HIV-1-specific lymphoproliferation remained largely undetectable throughout 2 years of infection, and results were similar upon evaluation of lymphoid cells. Rare patients with HIV-1-specific responses had significantly lower plasma HIV-1 RNA levels than did nonresponders. These results indicate that T helper dysfunction occurs early after HIV-1 acquisition and that untreated individuals rarely recover HIV-specific helper responses; these findings lend support for early therapeutic intervention to prevent the destruction and further impairment of the T helper cells."
1886,0.005,1.0000,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the IL28B gene have been shown to be associated with response to treatment for chronic hepatitis C and also with spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We analysed the association between IL28B genetic variants and spontaneous clearance of HCV infection in 376 HCV-infected Chinese paid plasma donors. Genotyping of eight SNPs near the IL28B region was performed by the iPLEX system (MassARRAY(®) SNP Genotyping; Sequenom) in all donors, and sequencing was performed on all 80 donors who cleared HCV and on 160 of 296 donors who did not clear HCV to validate the genotypes. Eighty (21.3%) donors spontaneously cleared HCV. Four SNPs were significantly associated with spontaneous HCV clearance: rs8099917 TT (vs GT), rs8105790 TT (vs CT), rs12980275 AA (vs AG) and rs10853728 CC (vs CG or GG) with OR (95% CI) 15.27 (2.07-112.50), 14.88 (2.02-109.72), 7.92 (1.88-33.32) and 2.32 (1.22-4.42) respectively. No association between the other four IL28B SNPs including rs12979860 and spontaneous HCV clearance was found. Women had a higher rate of spontaneous HCV clearance than men [56/213 (26.3%) vs 24/163 (14.6%), P = 0.007], and this was true even after stratification for IL28B genotypes with OR of 1.9-2.2 among those with favourable genotypes. Our results confirmed that IL28B polymorphism is associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV in Chinese subjects, but the SNPs that predict HCV clearance in Chinese subjects were different from those reported in Caucasians. Women were more likely to clear HCV infection regardless of IL28B genotypes."
17723,0.005,1.0000,"Twenty-five per cent of individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are able to clear HCV spontaneously. Differences in host genetics are believed to affect the outcome of HCV infection. We analysed an exonic, a promoter and an intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the interferon-λ3 coding interleukin (IL)-28B gene to study the relationship between IL28B SNPs and outcome of HCV infection. Among 206 HIV-1-infected Europeans with evidence of HCV infection, 47 (23%) individuals had cleared HCV and 159 (77%) had developed chronic infection. The exonic rs8103142 CT, the promoter rs12979860 CT and the intronic rs11881222 AG genotypes were associated with a decreased HCV clearance rate with adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of 0.3 (95% CI, 0.1-0.7), 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.8) and 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.8), respectively. The haplotype block TCG CTA was associated with a decreased HCV clearance rate (aOR 0.4, 95% CI, 0.2-0.8). Further, we found significant differences in HCV RNA levels among individuals chronically infected with HCV genotype 1 for rs8103142 and rs12979860 (P ≤ 0.05). Chronically infected individuals with HCV genotype 3 and with the favourable haplotype block CTA CTA had higher median HCV RNA levels than individuals with unfavourable haplotype blocks (P ≤ 0.05). Our findings suggest that IL28B may account for some differences in HCV outcome but that other factors including the viral genotype, host genetics and the host-virus interaction are likely to influence the outcome of HCV infection."
12801,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) subtype 1b, which infects approximately 70% of Japanese carriers, is likely to be more eradicable by a telaprevir regimen than subtype 1a because of the higher genetic barrier of Val(36) and Arg(155) substitutions. The aims of this exploratory study were to evaluate the virological response and safety of 24-week oral administration of telaprevir alone in chronic HCV subtype 1b infection. Fifteen treatment-naïve patients were treated with telaprevir 750 mg every 8 h for 24 weeks. All patients were Japanese whose median age was 58.0 years (range: 45-68), and six patients (40%) were men. Median baseline HCV RNA level was 6.80 log(10) IU/mL (range: 3.55-7.10). The HCV RNA levels decreased to undetectable in five patients (33%) within 8 weeks. Three patients (20%) with negative HCV RNA by Week 4 achieved end of treatment response. One patient (7%) who achieved sustained virological response had a low baseline viraemia of 3.55 log(10) IU/mL. Most of the adverse events including anaemia and skin disorders were mild to moderate. Developed variants were T54A and A156V/T/F/Y with or without secondary substitutions rather than V36M ± R155K. Telaprevir alone for 24 weeks in Japanese patients with HCV subtype 1b resulted in an sustained viral response rate of 7% (1/15) and was well tolerated for 24 weeks. These results will support the implementation of further studies on oral combination of telaprevir with other direct-acting antiviral agents in patients infected with HCV subtype 1b."
14970,0.005,1.0000,"The rate of newly diagnosed AIDS in the United States is increasing fastest in women, who are infected with HIV primarily through heterosexual transmission. Approximately 60% of these women are African American, and 18% are Latina. A gynecologic infection is the most common symptom that leads to initial medical evaluation. Specific studies at baseline should include CD4 lymphocyte count, HIV-1 RNA level, and gynecologic examination with Papanicolaou smear. Decisions about initiation of antiretroviral therapy depend on the patient's clinical diagnoses, her willingness to adhere to treatment, and CD4 lymphocyte and HIV-1 RNA levels. Levels of HIV-1 RNA may be somewhat lower in women than in men at the same CD4 count, whereas women have higher CD4 lymphocyte counts at the time of AIDS diagnosis. However, prospective trials have not yet indicated the need to change the threshold CD4 lymphocyte counts or HIV-RNA levels for initiation of therapy in women. The efficacy of antiretroviral therapy appears to be similar in men and women, although women are more likely to experience toxicities. Abnormal Papanicolaou smears occur in approximately 40% of women at baseline, and 58% are infected with human papillomavirus. The prevalence of both conditions increases with lower CD4 lymphocyte counts and higher HIV-1 RNA levels. Precursor lesions to cervical cancer may be effectively treated, but almost 50% recur within 1 year, mandating careful follow-up. Referral should be sought for specialized gynecologic care and for issues related to HIV itself, since survival is prolonged in patients treated by physicians who are experienced in treating HIV. When they are provided the same access to care, HIV-infected women have similar prognoses as HIV-infected men."
8391,0.005,1.0000,"Seminal viral load is likely to be directly related to the sexual transmissibility of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, it is not clear whether the level of HIV-1 in semen varies with the stage of infection and whether antiretroviral therapy reduces seminal viral load. A nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) technique was used to quantify HIV-1 RNA as an indicator of infectious viral load in semen and blood plasma of homosexual men with different stages and durations of HIV-1 infection. The median viral load in a cross section of 34 men was 11,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml (range, <400 to 1.3 x 10(7) copies/ml) in whole semen and 5,238 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml (range, <400 to 2.8 x 10(5) copies/ml) in seminal plasma, which is 10- to 1,000-fold higher than previous estimates. Viral loads in whole semen and seminal plasma were strongly correlated with blood plasma viral load (P < 0.001) but not with blood CD4+ T-cell count (P = 0.420). Longitudinal analysis of eight subjects who progressed to AIDS showed that seminal viral load increased in most cases, with viral load consistently higher in blood plasma than in semen. Viral loads in semen and blood plasma decreased markedly in six other patients following initiation of potent combination therapy with a protease inhibitor (indinavir) and a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (DMP-266). These findings have important implications for the biology of sexual transmission of HIV-1 and its potential reduction by antiretroviral therapy."
12668,0.005,1.0000,"Clinical, virologic, and immunologic outcomes were analyzed in children with vertically transmitted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (n = 25) and clinical symptoms and evidence of immunosuppression to establish the efficacy of 18 months' treatment with stavudine, lamivudine, and indinavir. Children were naive for treatment with protease inhibitors and lamivudine and had minimal exposure to stavudine. At 1, 6, 12, and 18 months, the proportions of patients with HIV-RNA <400 copies/mL were 79%, 100%, 94%, 87% in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) immunologic class 2 and 50%, 67%, 67%, 72% in CDC immunologic class 3. At 12 months, the median CD4(+) count and percent increased significantly in both CDC immunologic class groups, but to a greater extent in the class 3 group. In the 12- to 18-month period, there were no significant changes within the groups. In both groups there was a steady increase in the proportion and number of children with positive skin test responses. Children in class 2 were more likely to have a positive delayed-type hypersensitivity response and a greater number of positive responses. Lymphocyte proliferative response to recall antigens improved significantly in all patients. The rate of increase in positive test results was faster in children in class 2 than in those in class 3. Only minor clinical events occurred during 18 months of therapy. Potent antiretroviral therapy achieves a sustained benefit in HIV-infected children, but immune reconstitution is more likely achieved in children with less advanced disease."
282,0.005,1.0000,"Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the frequency of opportunistic disorders (ODs) of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients has fallen dramatically. We have found, however, that despite the use of HAART, HIV-infected patients can still present with GI ODs. To evaluate the prevalence of GI ODs in HIV-infected patients on HAART who were undergoing endoscopic evaluation for GI-related symptoms. From January 1996 through February 2002, all HIV-infected patients undergoing GI endoscopy were prospectively identified; mucosal biopsies were obtained in a standardized fashion and histologic specimens were examined by a single GI pathologist. All the patients on HAART presenting with a GI OD are described. Results showed that 294 patients (88% men; mean age, 36.5 +/- 10 years; median CD4 lymphocyte count, 64 cells/microl; range, 1-884; median viral RNA level, 40,357 copies/ml; range, 0-7,721,715) underwent 401 upper and/or lower endoscopies during the study period. The use of HAART increased from 10% in early 1996 to 85% in 2002. Nevertheless we found that 27 patients (9%) presented with a GI OD despite HAART. Forty percent of the patients with a GI OD were noncompliant with HAART. We conclude that GI ODs can occur despite HAART and normal CD4 counts. The prevalence of GI ODs in HIV-infected patients taking HAART is 9%. The reasons for this are multifactorial and likely include noncompliance with medications, viral resistance to the drugs, and decreased drug bioavailability. Although the use of HAART has led to a decreased incidence of GI ODs in AIDS, the gastroenterologist evaluating these patients should not discard the possibility that the GI symptoms in HIV-infected patients taking HAART may be secondary to an OD, even when the CD4 count is normal and the viral load is low."
109,0.005,1.0000,"Clinical manifestations of primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (acute retroviral syndrome) and virologic characteristics of HIV-1 have rarely been described in Taiwan. Medical records of patients followed at the National Taiwan University Hospital between June 1994 and September 2003 were retrospectively reviewed to identify HIV-infected patients who were diagnosed with primary HIV infection. Blood specimens obtained at the diagnosis of primary HIV infection were submitted for viral subtyping and genotypic resistance assay. Twenty out of 940 patients were diagnosed with acute retroviral syndrome during the study period. All of the patients were males, with a median age of 31 years (range, 23 to 42 years); all were men who had sex with men. The most common clinical manifestations were fever (95%), generalized lymphadenopathy (75%), pharyngitis (70%), skin rashes (70%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (60%) including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Thrombocytopenia (35%), leukopenia (35%), and elevated liver function test (50%) were seen in the laboratory tests. The median CD4 lymphocyte count was 312 cells/microL (range, 112-520 cells/microL), and the plasma HIV RNA load by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was 230,500 copies/mL (range, 602 --> 750,000 copies/mL). No major resistance mutations on protease or reverse transcriptase were identified in the 11 available viral isolates. We conclude that primary HIV infection was rarely diagnosed in the designated hospital for HIV care in Taiwan. More education of health care providers and counseling of persons at risk to increase awareness of HIV infection are urgently needed in Taiwan in order to facilitate earlier diagnosis of primary HIV infection and prevent further transmission."
9097,0.005,1.0000,"We assessed the safety and surrogate markers' effect of acemannan as an adjunctive to antiretroviral therapy among patients with advanced HIV disease receiving zidovudine (ZDV) or didanosine (ddI) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of acemannan (400 mg orally four times daily). Eligible patients of either sex had CD4 counts of 50-300/microl twice within 1 month of study entry and had received 26 months of antiretroviral treatment (ZDV or ddI) at a stable dose for the month before entry. CD4 counts were made every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. P24 antigen was measured at entry and every 12 weeks thereafter. Sequential quantitative lymphocyte cultures for HIV and ZDV pharmacokinetics were performed in a subset of patients. Sixty-three patients were randomized. All were males (mean age 39 years). The mean baseline CD4 counts were 165 and 147/microl in the placebo and acemannan groups, respectively; 90 percent of the patients were receiving ZDV at entry. Six patients in the acemannan group and five in the placebo group developed AIDS-defining illnesses. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups at 48 weeks with regard to the absolute change or rate of decline at CD4 count. Among ZDV-treated patients, the median rates of CD4 change (ACD4) in the initial 16 weeks were - 121 and - 120 cells per year in the placebo and acemannan groups, respectively ( p = 0.45), ACD4 from week 16 to 48 was 0 and - 61 cells per year in the acemannan and placebo groups (p = .11), respectively. There was no statistical difference between groups with regard to adverse events, p24 antigen, quantitative virology, or pharmacokinetics. Twenty-four patients, 11 receiving placebo and 13 receiving acemannan, discontinued study therapy prematurely, none due to serious adverse reactions. Our results demonstrate that acemannan at an oral daily dose of 1600 mg does not prevent the decline in CD4 count characteristic of progressive HIV disease. Acemannan showed no significant effect on p24 antigen and quantitative virology. Acemannan was well tolerated and showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction with ZDV."
10086,0.005,1.0000,"We conducted a cross sectional study of the outpatient medical records of 1000 HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2011 to determine the incidence of clinically significant drug interactions (CSDI). The severities of the CSDI were graded following the Micromedex"" 2.0 database and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) 2012 HIV treatment guidelines. Three hundred thirty-five patients (34%) had 554 episodes of CSDI. Of which 337 episodes (61%), 163 episodes (29%) and 54 episodes (10%) had grades 2, 3 and 4 severity CSDI, respectively. The CSDI were caused by protease inhibitor (PI)-based drug regimens in 79%, by efavirenz-based regimens in 34% and by nevirapine-based regimens in 10% (p<0.001). The three most common grade 4 CSDI were: a PI with simvastatin (n=24), simvastatin with gemfibrozil (n=24) and didanosine with allopurinol (n=2). The three most common grade 3 CSDI were: a PI with a statin drug except simvastatin (n=56), fenofibrate with a statin drug (n=28) and amlodipine with simvastatin (n=14). On multivariate analysis, risk factors associated with CSDI were: receiving a PI-based regimen (OR 14.44; 95% CI: 9.10-22.88), having dyslipidemia (OR 3.94; 95% CI: 1.89-8.21), having >5 items prescribed at a time (OR 1.80; 95% CI: 1.23-2.63), seeing a doctor >4 times a year (OR 1.72; 95% CI: 1.20-2.46), having hypertension (OR 0.60; 95% CI: 0.37-0.98), having a duration of receiving ART of >5 years (OR 0.46; 95% CI: 0.28-0.77) and having a CD4 count of >200 cells/mm3 (OR 0.46; 95%CI: 0.26-0.84). CSDI were common among HIV-infected patients receiving ARV in our outpatient clinic. Patients having a low CD, count, having dyslipidemia, receiving PI-based ART, having a frequent number of visits per year and having a large number of items prescribed at each visit had a greater chance of a CSDI."
4832,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to examine the effect of duration of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on a woman's likelihood of giving birth. Using longitudinal data from the Maryland state Human Immunodeficiency Virus Information System and a retrospective cohort design, the authors compared 1,642 women with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) to 8,443 uninfected women enrolled in the Medicaid program between 1985 and 1995. The decade before AIDS diagnosis was divided into four 2.5-year periods. Proximity to AIDS diagnosis served as a proxy for duration of infection. An extension of the Cox model was used to estimate the relative risk for giving birth, with adjustment for covariates and repeated outcomes. The average number of births per 100 person-years was 6.0 for HIV-infected women and 11.1 for uninfected women (adjusted relative risk = 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.57, 0.68). Accounting for duration of infection, the adjusted relative risks for birth among HIV-infected women, as compared with uninfected women, were 0.85 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.03), 0.74 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.86), 0.55 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.64), and 0.45 (95% CI: 0.38, 0.55) for successive 2.5-year periods before AIDS diagnosis. Demographic characteristics, contraception, abortion, fetal loss, or drug use could not fully explain the reductions. These results suggest that HIV-infected women experience a progressive reduction in births years before the onset of AIDS. This may compromise estimation of HIV prevalence and interpretation of time trends from serosurveillance of pregnant women."
3212,0.005,1.0000,"Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is one of the most widely used treatment options for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HBV infections. Despite its efficacy and safety, some cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in the treatment of HIV patients. Even more recently, very few cases of Fanconi syndrome associated with tenofovir therapy in HBV monoinfection have been reported. Herein, we report a case of a 47-year-old male with an HBV monoinfection, who developed Fanconi syndrome and a secondary osteomalacia with multiple bone pain. After TDF withdrawal and supplementation of calcitriol, his renal function was reverted. Although the overall risk of TDF-associated nephrotoxicity is very low, both glomerular and tubular function should be monitored in patients undergoing TDF treatment."

In 2005, the first episode of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), as assessed by parasitological diagnosis of bone marrow aspirate, was recorded. When admitted to the hospital, the patient presented fever, hepatosplenomegaly, weight loss, and diarrhea. Since then, six additional episodes of VL occurred, with a frequency rate of one per year (2005-2012, except in 2008). In 2011, the patient presented a disseminated skin lesion caused by the amastigotes of Leishmania, as identified by histopathological assessment of skin biopsy samples. In 2005, he was treated with N-methyl-glucamine-antimony and amphotericin B deoxycholate. However, since 2006 because of a reported toxicity, the drug of choice was liposomal amphotericin B. As recommended by the Ministry of Health, this report emphasizes the need for HIV patients living in VL endemic areas to include this parasitosis in their follow-up protocol, particularly after the first infection of VL."
5487,0.005,1.0000,"Numerous alterations in endocrine function are observed in HIV infection. Direct destruction of endocrine organs by HIV itself or by invasive infection with opportunistic organisms resulting in loss of function is rare. When acutely ill, HIV patients can develop the metabolic derangements that accompany any severe systemic disorder. Studies of thyroid function tests emphasize that the presence of acute secondary infection must be analyzed when evaluating such patients. In addition to euthyroid sick syndrome other hormonal axes are affected by severe illness. These alterations may be cytokine mediated. As with seronegative patients, these changes can be transient and resolve with successful treatment of the intervening illness. Given the complexity of HIV disease, future reports should characterize patients by CD4 cell count, history of AIDS-indicating illnesses, and viral load. Viral burden is an independent predictor of immunosuppression and progression to AIDS. A large number of medications used in the treatment of HIV infection and related illnesses can alter endocrine function, mineral and electrolyte balance, and substrate turnover. Drug therapy must be considered in the evaluation of endocrine abnormalities in HIV-infected patients and carefully characterized in studies of these patients. The endocrine effects of medications used in the treatment of HIV infection are summarized in Table 3. Concomitant factors that affect endocrine function independent of the HIV virus can confound results in these patients. For example, opiate use affects PRL, gonadotropins, and cortisol response to ACTH stimulation. Investigations in HIV-infected patients must include careful descriptions of the study population and comparison to relevant controls. HIV-infected patients may also demonstrate more subtle alterations in endocrinological function in early, relatively asymptomatic, stages. The etiology and clinical significance of these changes, particularly their relationship to cytokines, continues to be investigated. The sequential studies of stable aldosterone levels despite decreased aldosterone response to ACTH stimulation indicate that alterations in response to provocative testing do not predict the development of hormonal insufficiency in this patient population. Similar longitudinal studies need to be done for the other hormonal axes to further delineate the endocrinological alterations in HIV infection. Finally, when the rationale for hormone replacement is debatable, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are necessary. Transient improvement in clinical status during open-label treatment does not prove hormone insufficiency. The long-term efficacy and safety of hormonal therapy must be demonstrated."
2265,0.005,1.0000,"Neutropenia frequently complicates infection due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The etiology of neutropenia in this setting includes bone marrow infection or infiltration, myelosuppressive therapies, the presence of antibodies to HIV, and accelerated apoptosis. Protection against microbial invaders by neutrophils is further compromised by impaired chemotaxis and phagocytosis, production of toxic oxygen species, and expression of cellular adhesion molecules. Neutropenia is a significant risk factor for bacterial infection in HIV-infected patients. Endogenous cytokines, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, regulate neutrophil count and function. Treatment with recombinant human methionyl G-CSF (filgrastim) has lessened neutropenia in patients with HIV infection. Clinical trials have shown that the incidence of bacterial infections and the number of consequent days of hospitalization for HIV-infected patients receiving filgrastim therapy are lower. Filgrastim treatment also allows administration of larger doses of myelosuppressive agents."
15820,0.005,1.0000,"Drug treatment has the potential to reduce incidence of blood-borne infections by helping injection drug users (IDUs) achieve abstinence or by decreasing the frequency of injection and sharing practices. We studied the associations between retention in methadone treatment and drug use behaviors and incidence of hepatitis B and C in a cohort of IDUs in the Seattle, Washington, area. Data on IDUs entering methadone treatment at four centers in King County, Washington, were collected through face-to-face interviews using a standardized questionnaire at baseline and 12-month follow-up between October 1994 and January 1998. Blood specimens were obtained and tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C. Drug treatment status at follow-up was analyzed in relation to study enrollment characteristics and potential treatment outcomes, including injection risk behaviors, cessation or reduced frequency of injection, and incidence of hepatitis B and C. Of 716 IDUs, 292 (41%) left treatment, 198 (28%) disrupted (left and returned) treatment, and 226 (32%) continued treatment throughout the 1-year follow-up period. Compared to those who left treatment, subjects who disrupted or continued were less likely to inject at follow-up (odds ratio [OR] = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.7; and OR = 0.1, 95% CI 0.1-0.2, respectively). Among the 468 (65%) subjects who continued injecting, those who continued treatment injected less frequently, were less likely to pool money to buy drugs (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8) and inject with used needles (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.2-0.8) compared to those who left treatment. Cooker or cotton sharing was not associated with retention in treatment, but hepatitis B incidence was lowest among those who continued treatment. The results of this study suggest drug use risk reduction is more likely to be achieved by those who remain in drug treatment and by those who stop injecting, but that those who drop out and return and those who continue to inject while in treatment may also benefit. This supports the role of consistent drug treatment in an overall harm-reduction strategy."
6397,0.005,1.0000,"We wished to determine the short-term safety and efficacy of a Chinese medicinal herb preparation in treating symptoms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in a University-affiliated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) clinic at a public general hospital. Thirty adults with symptomatic HIV infection, no previous AIDS-defining diagnosis, and CD4+ counts of 0.200-0.499 x 10(9)/L (200-499/mm3) received 28 tablets each day of either a standardized oral preparation of 31 Chinese herbs or a cellulose placebo. Primary outcome measures were changes in life satisfaction, perceived health, and number and severity of symptoms. Other outcomes included adherence, and changes in weight, CD4+ count, depression, anxiety, physical and social function, and mental health. Two placebo- and no herb-treated subjects had mild adverse events (AE). Subjects on both arms reported taking 94% of prescribed tablets. No differences between treatment groups reached the p < 0.05 level. Life satisfaction improved in herb-treated [+0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): +0.29, +1.43] but not in placebo-treated subjects (+0.20, 95% CI -0.35, + 0.75). Number of symptoms was reduced in subjects receiving herbs (-2.2, 95% CI -4.1, -0.3) but not in those receiving placebo (-0.3, 95% CI -3.2, +2.7). There were trends toward greater improvements among herb-treated subjects on all symptom subscales except dermatologic. Believing that one was receiving herbs was strongly associated with reporting that the treatment had helped (p < 0.005), but not with changes in life satisfaction or symptoms. There were improvements in life satisfaction and symptoms among subjects receiving the herbal therapy. Whether Chinese herbs are effective in the management of symptomatic HIV infection can be adequately addressed only by larger trials of longer duration."
425,0.005,1.0000,"The factors leading to spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) or to viral persistence are elusive. Understanding virus-host interactions that enable acute HCV clearance is key to the development of more effective therapeutic and prophylactic strategies. Here, using a sensitive neutralization assay based on infectious HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp), we have studied the kinetics of humoral responses in a cohort of acute-phase patients infected during a single nosocomial outbreak in a hemodialysis center. The 17 patients were monitored for the spontaneous outcome of HCV infection for 6 months before a treatment decision was made. Blood samples were taken frequently (15 +/- 4 per patient). Phylogenetic analysis of the predominant virus(es) revealed infection by only one of two genotype 1b strains. While all patients seroconverted, their sera induced two opposing effects in HCVpp infection assays: inhibition and facilitation. Furthermore, the ability of sera to facilitate or inhibit infection correlated with the presence of either infecting HCV strain and divided the patients into two groups. In group 1, the progressive emergence of a relatively strong neutralizing response correlated with a fluctuating decrease in high initial viremia, leading to control of viral replication. Patients in group 2 failed to reduce viremia within the acute phase, and no neutralizing responses were detected despite seroconversion. Strikingly, sera of group 2, as well as naive sera, facilitated infection by HCVpp displaying HCV glycoproteins from different genotypes and strains, including those retrieved from patients. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of viral persistence and immune control of viremia."
8589,0.005,1.0000,"Within Mozambique's current HIV care system, there are numerous opportunities for a person to become lost to follow-up (LTFU) prior to initiating antiretroviral therapy (pre-ART). We explored pre-ART LTFU in Zambézia province utilizing quantitative and qualitative methods. Patients were deemed LTFU if they were more than 60 days late for either a scheduled appointment or a CD4+ cell count blood draw, according to national guidelines. Among 13,968 adult patients registered for care, 211 (1.8 %) died, one transferred, 2,196 (15.7 %) initiated ART, and 9,195 (65.8 %) were LTFU during the first year. Being male, younger, less educated, and/or having no home electricity were associated with LTFU. Qualitative interviews revealed that poor clinical care, logistics and competing priorities contribute to attrition. In addition, many expressed fears of stigma and/or rejection by family or community members because they were HIV-infected. At 66 %, pre-ART LTFU in Zambézia, Mozambique is a significant problem. This study highlights characteristics of lost patients and discusses barriers requiring consideration to improve retention. "
14050,0.005,1.0000,"Reactive astrocytosis is a well-documented feature of HIV encephalitis (HIVE), but it is unclear whether restricted infection of astrocytes contributes to this phenomenon. In addition, the part played by reactive and/or infected astrocytes in AIDS-related dementia is not fully understood. In this study of patients at different stages of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, who had been treated at most with one antiretroviral drug, reactive astrocytes were identified by immunopositivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and infected astrocytes by positivity for HIV Nef protein. Results were compared for drug-using AIDS patients with (n=9) and without (n=7) HIVE, for presymptomatic HIV-positive drug users (n=12) and for control HIV-negative subjects (n=20), including a group who used drugs (n=10). GFAP-reactive astrocytes in both grey and white matter were significantly more numerous in HIVE subjects than in each of the other groups but did not correlate with viral load. Nef-positive astrocytes were confined to HIVE cases and to white matter, but were numerous in only one subject who was treatment-naive. Nef-positive microglia were identified in all HIVE cases and in occasional AIDS and presymptomatic subjects who did not have HIVE. The results suggest that astrocytes may form an additional viral reservoir in late HIV infection and may contribute to HIVE. However, the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes was neither increased in pre-AIDS nor in drug abuse, in contrast with microglia which we have shown previously to be up-regulated in both states."
8132,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the management and prognosis of severe Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patients. An observational cohort study of HIV-negative adults with PJP documented by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) through Gomori-Grocott staining or immunofluorescence, admitted to one intensive care unit (ICU) for acute respiratory failure, was undertaken. From 1990 to 2010, 70 patients (24 females, 46 males) were included, with a mean age of 58.6 ± 18.3 years. The mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS)-II was 36.9 ± 20.4. Underlying conditions included hematologic malignancies (n = 21), vasculitis (n = 13), and solid tumors (n = 13). Most patients were receiving systemic corticosteroids (n = 63) and cytotoxic drugs (n = 51). Not a single patient received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as PJP prophylaxis. Endotracheal intubation (ETI) was required in 42 patients (60.0 %), including 38 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In-ICU mortality was 52.9 % overall, reaching 80.9 % and 86.8 %, respectively, for patients who required ETI and for patients with ARDS. In the univariate analysis, in-ICU mortality was associated with SAPS-II (p = 0.0131), ARDS (p < 0.0001), shock (p < 0.0001), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) on BAL (p = 0.0031). In the multivariate analysis, only ARDS was associated with in-ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR] 23.4 [4.5-121.9], p < 0.0001). PJP in non-HIV patients remains a serious disease with high in-hospital mortality. Pulmonary co-infection with HSV or CMV may contribute to fatal outcome."
14271,0.005,1.0000,"BACKGROUND Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the United States (US). Although most cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are secondary to bacterial infection, up to one-third of cases are secondary to viral infection, most commonly due to rhinovirus and influenza virus. Pneumonia due to herpes simplex virus (HSV) is rare, and there is limited knowledge of the pathogenesis and clinical complications. This report is of a fatal case of HSV pneumonia associated with bilateral pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. CASE REPORT A 36-year-old homeless male Hispanic patient, who was a chronic smoker, with a history of intravenous drug abuse and a medical history of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), was admitted to hospital as an emergency with a seven-day history of productive purulent cough. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with a diagnosis of CAP, with intubation and mechanical ventilation. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and was positive for HSV. The patient developed bilateral pneumothorax with pneumomediastinum, which was fatal, despite aggressive clinical management. CONCLUSIONS Pneumonia due to HSV infection is uncommon but has a high mortality. Although HSV pneumonia has been described in immunocompromised patients, further studies are required to determine the pathogenesis, early detection, identification of patients who are at risk and to determine the most effective approaches to prophylaxis and treatment for HSV pneumonia."
6409,0.005,1.0000,"Despite antiretroviral therapy, pneumonias from pathogens such as pneumococcus continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality in HIV-1-infected individuals. Respiratory infections occur despite high CD4 counts and low viral loads; therefore, better understanding of lung immunity and infection predictors is necessary. We tested whether metabolomics, an integrated biosystems approach to molecular fingerprinting, could differentiate such individual characteristics. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf ) was collected from otherwise healthy HIV-1-infected individuals and healthy controls. A liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry method was used to detect metabolites in BALf. Statistical and bioinformatic analyses used false discovery rate (FDR) and orthogonally corrected partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to identify groupwise discriminatory factors as the top 5% of metabolites contributing to 95% separation of HIV-1 and control. We enrolled 24 subjects with HIV-1 (median CD4=432) and 24 controls. A total of 115 accurate mass m/z features from C18 and AE analysis were significantly different between HIV-1 subjects and controls (FDR=0.05). Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed clusters of metabolites, which discriminated the samples according to HIV-1 status (FDR=0.05). Several of these did not match any metabolites in metabolomics databases; mass-to-charge 325.065 ([M+H](+)) was significantly higher (FDR=0.05) in the BAL of HIV-1-infected subjects and matched pyochelin, a siderophore-produced Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Metabolic profiles in BALf differentiated healthy HIV-1-infected subjects and controls. The lack of association with known human metabolites and inclusion of a match to a bacterial metabolite suggest that the differences could reflect the host's lung microbiome and/or be related to subclinical infection in HIV-1-infected patients."
7704,0.005,1.0000,"A high heterogeneity is found in the HIV-1 genome in vivo, not only between individuals, but also within a single individual. Different types of genetic heterogeneity of HIV-1 can be analyzed: the extension and the evolution of the viral quasispecies in blood, the variation between the virus obtained from different body compartment, the differences between isolates from diverse individuals and between HIV-1 subtypes. The virus population during primary HIV-1 infection is generally homogeneous and the intrahost viral evolution is thought to be forced (in absence of antiviral therapy) by the immune system pressure and is generally related to the length of the immunocompetent period. A group of 12 Italian and Swedish well characterized HIV-1 infected long-term nonprogressors (LNTP) have been analyzed for the viral heterogeneity, calculated in the nef gene and in the long terminal repeat (LTR). The intra-sample variations in LTNP were found comparable with those from 8 progressor patients, while a lower inter-individual diversity was observed in the former. In one LTNP the viral evolution during a four-years period was extremely low suggesting that other factors than the host immune pressure may be involved in modulating the intra- and inter-sample HIV-1 diversity."
15909,0.005,1.0000,"Direct population sequencing and reverse hybridization (line probe assay [LiPA])-based methods are the most common methods for detecting hepatitis B virus (HBV) drug resistance mutations, although only mutations present in viral quasispecies with a prevalence of > or =20% can be detected by sequencing, and only known mutations are detected by LiPA. Massively parallel ultradeep pyrosequencing (UDPS; GS FLX platform) was used to analyze HBV quasispecies in reverse transcriptase (RT) and hepatitis B S antigen (HBsAg) from five drug-naive patients and eight drug-resistant patients. Eight primer pairs were used to obtain partially overlapping amplicons, covering the RT gene from codons 1 to 288 and the complete overlapping HBsAg sequence. A 1% mutation frequency was selected as the cutoff based on an error rate estimated on plasmid DNA. This technology enabled simultaneous analysis of between 2,852 and 18,016 clonally amplified fragments from each patient. The results indicate that UDPS has a relative sensitivity much higher than both direct sequencing and LiPA. In addition, the UDPS results are quantitative, allowing establishment of the relative frequency of both known mutations and novel substitutions. Some of the detected RT substitutions led to changes also in HBsAg. On the whole, genotype D presented a higher heterogeneity than genotype A. Considering the high quantity of information that can be provided by a single test from one patient, the short turnaround time, the information on substitution frequency, and the detection of rare variants, there are strong advantages conferred by UDPS, and the new method could play a relevant role in the clinical management of HBV infection and therapy."

The main objective of this study was to review the mortality in HIV-infected paediatric patients in Barbados. It is a retrospective analysis of the hospitalization course of HIV-infected paediatric patients aged < 16 years who died during a 15-year period of surveillance. Using a specific database, information pertaining to number and duration of hospitalizations, and cause of death were analyzed. There were 39 (65%) deaths among 60 HIV-infected patients diagnosed during the period of study. Twenty-one (54%) were male and 18 (46%) were female. Twenty-seven (69%) case records were retrieved for analysis. The highest mortality (56%) was among patients aged < 1 year and between 1989 and 1995. Hospitalizations averaged three per patient. No patient received anti-retroviral therapy. Nineteen (70%) patients died during hospitalization on the paediatric ward. Lower respiratory tract infections suspected to be Pneumocystis carinii, gastroenteritis and septicaemia were the most frequent diagnoses at the time of death. The annual mortality ranged between 0 and 1.7 (mean 0.7) per 1000 live births. The overall mortality rate was high among HIV-infected paediatric patients, with lower respiratory tract infections being implicated as a major contributing cause of death. Results of this study definitely indicate a need for improved resources in the management of paediatric HIV/AIDS cases, especially focussing on the availability and administration of anti-retroviral therapy."
1066,0.005,1.0000,"The prognosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has improved in recent years with the introduction of antiretroviral treatment. While the frequency of AIDS-defining events has decreased as a cause of death, mortality from non-AIDS-related events including end-stage renal diseases has increased. The etiology of chronic kidney disease is multifactorial: immune-mediated glomerulonephritis, HIV-associated nephropathy, thrombotic microangiopathies, and so on. HIV infection is no longer a contraindication to transplantation and is becoming standard therapy in most developed countries. The HIV criteria used to select patients for renal transplantation are similar in Europe and North America. Current criteria state that prior opportunistic infections are not a strict exclusion criterion, but patients must have a CD4+ count above 200 cells/mm(3) and a HIV-1 RNA viral load suppressible with treatment. In recent years, more than 200 renal transplants have been performed in HIV-infected patients worldwide, and mid-term patient and graft survival rates have been similar to that of HIV-negative patients. The main issues in post-transplant period are pharmacokinetic interactions between antiretrovirals and immunosuppressants, a high rate of acute rejection, the management of hepatitis C virus coinfection, and the high cardiovascular risk after transplantation. More studies are needed to determine the most appropriate antiretroviral and immunosuppressive regimens and the long-term outcome of HIV infection and kidney graft."
12837,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated the association of the number of late antiretroviral therapy (ART) refills with patient outcomes in a large public-sector human immunodeficiency virus treatment program in Lusaka, Zambia. Using pharmacy data routinely collected during 2004-2010, we calculated the number of late refills during the initial year of ART. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression to examine the association between the number of late refills and death or program failure (i.e., death, loss to follow-up, or program withdrawal) >12 months after ART initiation, with and without stratification by the medication possession ratio (MPR) during the initial year of ART. Of 53,015 adults who received ART for ≥12 months (median follow-up duration, 86.1 months; interquartile range, 53.2-128.2 months), 26,847 (50.6%) had 0 late refills, 16,762 (31.6%) had 1, 6,505 (12.3%) had 2, and 2,901 (5.5%) had ≥3. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that ≥3 late refills was associated with a greater mortality risk than 1 and 2 late refills (p<0.001, by the log-rank test). The mortality risk was greater for patients with 2 late refills [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99-1.38] or ≥3 late refills (adjusted HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.23-1.87), compared with that for patients with 0-1 late refills. Program failure was associated with ≥2 late refills. An MPR of <80% was associated with similar increases in mortality risk across late-refill strata. Monitoring late refills during the initial period of ART may help resource- and time-constrained clinics identify patients at risk for program failure."
17013,0.005,1.0000,"It has been suggested that circulating immune complexes containing HIV-1 could be involved in enhancement of the infection through Fc receptors. To test this hypothesis, immune complexes precipitated from the sera of 25 HIV-1-seropositive individuals, at different stages of the disease, were assayed for the presence of infectious virus. When added to phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes, seven of 25 complexes were able to sustain a productive infection. This was demonstrated by release of HIV-p24 antigens in the supernatant of activated but not resting peripheral blood lymphocytes after several days of culture. Moreover, peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured with complexes from HIV-1+ patients but not from control subject, contained integrated HIV-1 provirus in their DNA. These results demonstrated the presence of infectious virus in immune complexes from HIV-1+ patients."
71,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study is to describe the clinical, biological, therapeutic and evolving current profile of hospitalized patients with HIV infection in the cohort of the Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit (ITDU) in the aim to improve their care management. This is a retrospective study, conducted on medical data of hospitalized cases of patients with HIV infection in the ITDU at the teaching hospital of Treichville (Abidjan) from 2006 to 2007. During the two years, 447 patients were included in the study. Their average age was 39 years [18 years-86 years] and sex ratio was 0.69. Of the 447 patients, 35% were unemployed and 67% were new patients who had never undergone antiretroviral therapy (ART). The duration of drug exposure was less than 6 months in 59% of treated patients. The average time to initiate ART was seven weeks. Among naive patients 41.9% were lost to follow up, 35.9% were waiting for treatment and 22.1% waiting for baseline biological test to initiate ART. At the initiation of ART, 79.6% of patients had a CD4 count less than 200/mm(3). The reasons of hospitalization defining AIDS were dominated by tuberculosis (34.2%), cerebral toxoplasmosis (17.9%) and neuromeningeal cryptococcosis (8%). The main reasons of hospitalization in classifying non-AIDS were pyelonephritis (6.5%), bacterial pneumonia (5.4%) and undetermined infectious encephalitis (4.9%). Hospital mortality was 24.4%. The leading causes of death were tuberculosis (22.9%), cerebral toxoplasmosis (20.2%), undetermined infectious encephalitis (18.3%) and cryptococcal meningitis (13.7%). The profile of PLHIV in hospital is characterized by profound immunosuppression due to late diagnosis and high mortality associated with severe opportunistic infections and late initiation of ART."

The progressive loss of these cells eventually results in the loss of an ability to mount desirable immune response to any pathogen and death of the patients in the terminal stage of HIV infection, i.e., acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The longitudinal monitoring of CD4+ counts is used as a monitoring tool for disease progression and effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment. Various methods are being used for determination of absolute CD4+ T lymphocytes from the peripheral blood. To date, the flow cytometry is considered as the gold standard. Different modifications have been tried in the conventional flow cytometry to increase accuracy and cost-effectivity especially for adapting in resource-poor settings. Principles of the conventional and modified methodologies are discussed. The non-flow cytometric methodologies are also there that might be available soon widely. The choice of the methodology should depend upon the purpose of the assay, the age group of the patients, sample turnover and available resources. Importance of maintaining both internal and external quality control systems in every laboratory performing CD4 count estimation are discussed."
8364,0.005,1.0000,"Current evidence indicates that the length of survival for patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is increasing, thereby affording a greater opportunity for strategies designed to prevent the infectious diseases that mark the syndrome. Because these infections may occur at different stages of immunosuppression caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), effective application of preventive measures depends not only on detection of HIV infection but also on the use of staging indicators. The diseases that serve to define AIDS, such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, tend to occur late in the course of HIV infection and often when the T helper lymphocyte (CD4+ cells) count is less than 0.2 x 10(9)/l. Other infections, such as tuberculosis and pyogenic bacterial pneumonia, may develop at any point after HIV infection has occurred. Given this relation between the degree of immunosuppression and the occurrence of particular pulmonary infections, different preventive interventions should be applied at different times. It is now known that the incidence of several of the pulmonary infections that are common in patients with HIV infection can be reduced by prophylactic measures. Pneumocystis pneumonia is decreased in frequency by any one of several prophylactic agents, the best established being pentamidine administered as an inhaled aerosol. The role of isoniazid in the chemoprophylaxis of tuberculosis in patients not infected with HIV is well established. Although there is little evidence of benefit so far from isoniazid in HIV infected patients with a positive tuberculin skin test response, it is logical to assume that there could be some effect. The use of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine may also be of some benefit in reducing the frequency of pneumococcal pneumonia in patients with AIDS. In addition to these specific measures, the antiretroviral agent zidovudine decreases both the frequency and the severity of opportunist infections, at least during the first few months of treatment. A comprehensive strategy for prevention of HIV associated lung infection first requires detection of HIV seropositivity, staging the immunosuppression by the CD4+ cell count, and determining whether tuberculous infection is present by a tuberculin skin test. All seropositive individuals should be given pneumococcal vaccine and those with evidence of tuberculosis infection should be treated with isoniazid for one year. Zidovudine should probably be started when CD4+ cell counts are in the range 0.4-0.5 x 10(9)/l and prophylaxis against pneumocystis infection when CD4+ cell counts are in the range 0.2-0.3 x 10(9)/l."
18478,0.005,1.0000,"In individuals with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, a small reservoir of resting memory CD4(+) T lymphocytes carrying latent, integrated provirus persists even in patients treated for prolonged periods with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This reservoir greatly complicates the prospects for eradicating HIV-1 infection with antiretroviral drugs. Therefore, it is critical to understand how HIV-1 latency is established and maintained. In particular, it is important to determine whether transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanisms are involved. Therefore, HIV-1 DNA and mRNAs were measured in highly purified populations of resting CD4(+) T lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of patients on long-term HAART. In such patients, the predominant form of persistent HIV-1 is latent integrated provirus. Typically, 100 HIV-1 DNA molecules were detected per 10(6) resting CD4(+) T cells. Only very low levels of unspliced HIV-1 RNA ( approximately 50 copies/10(6) resting CD4(+) T cells) were detected using a reverse transcriptase PCR assay capable of detecting a single molecule of RNA standard. Levels of multiply spliced HIV-1 RNA were below the limit of detection (<50 copies/10(6) cells). Only 1% of the HIV-1 DNA-positive lymphocytes in this compartment could be induced to up-regulate HIV-1 mRNAs after cellular activation, indicating that most of the proviral DNA in resting CD4(+) T cells either carries intrinsic defects precluding transcription or is subjected to transcriptional control mechanisms that preclude high-level production of multiply spliced mRNAs. Nevertheless, by inducing T-cell activation, it is possible to isolate replication-competent virus from resting CD4(+) T lymphocytes of all infected individuals, including those on prolonged HAART. Thus, a subset of integrated proviruses (1%) remains competent for high-level mRNA production after cellular activation, and a subset of these can produce infectious virus. Measurements of steady-state levels of multiply spliced and unspliced HIV-1 RNA prior to cellular activation suggest that infected resting CD4(+) T lymphocytes in blood synthesize very little viral RNA and are unlikely to be capable of producing virus. In these cells, latency appears to reflect regulation at the level of mRNA production rather than at the level of splicing or nuclear export of viral mRNAs."
1432,0.005,1.0000,"We have used a Cartesian coordinate plot to analyze the inverse relationship between viral burden (x-axis) and peripheral blood CD4+ cell count (y-axis) to extend our understanding of the mechanisms of antiviral drugs and differences in outcome resulting from variability in virus and host responses. Each of 186 subjects studied were assigned to one of four response quadrants. Quadrants A (x-, y+) and D (x+, y-) defined the effect of a change in virus load on the inverse change in CD4+ cell count expected from the natural history of HIV infection or antiretroviral therapy. Quadrants B (x+, y+) and C (x-, y-) defined the dissociation of the inverse relationship between the relative changes in CD4+ cell count and viral load that resulted from the hypothesized effect of putative virologic or immunologic response modifiers. Of the response modifiers studied, only the syncytium-inducing phenotype resulted in a complete dissociation of this inverse relationship. The analysis provided an integrated virological and immunological approach to better understand therapeutic responses and potential dissociation between changes in viral RNA and CD4+ cell count. This type of analysis may be helpful for individualizing patient management as well as designing and analyzing studies of HIV-1 antiretroviral drugs and disease pathogenesis."
9613,0.005,1.0000,"From March 2000 through April 2001, 385 HIV-positive individuals were evaluated to determine the prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae nasopharynx carriage, to determine antimicrobial susceptibility and serotypes, and to study factors associated with carriage. Each patient was interviewed, and a nasopharyngeal culture, HIV viral load, and CD4 lymphocyte count were obtained. Of 385 patients studied, 64 were carriers of S. pneumoniae (17%). Intermediate susceptibility to penicillin occurred in 18 isolates (28%) and there were no resistant isolates; 50% of the isolates belonged to 3 serotypes (14, 6B, and 9V). One isolate belonged to clone Spain(9V)-3. Tobacco use and intravenous illicit drugs were associated with carriage; HIV viral load and CD4 lymphocyte level were not significantly associated with carriage. The use of the same unaltered antiretroviral regimen for a year or more was associated with a lower risk of colonization, suggesting that prolonged use of highly effective antiretroviral therapy lowers pneumococcal carriage and may lower the risk of infection."

From April 1991 to January 1993, 9,518 pregnant women were interviewed and serologically tested for antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2; 26 (0.3%) were HIV-1 seropositive, 44 (0.5%) were HIV-2 seropositive, two (0.02%) were dually seropositive, and 9,448 (99.3%) were seronegative. Guinea-Bissau nationality and age > 25 years were associated with HIV-2 infection, whereas parity < or = 2 was associated with HIV-1 infection. Among women who gave birth to live infants, shorter length of union with the partner and having been married more than once were associated with HIV-2 infection, whereas age < or = 25 years was associated with HIV-1 infection. Information gained by this study may help target intervention strategies for preventing maternal HIV infection and understanding biological differences between the two viruses."

HIV-1-infected women receiving HAART were less likely to have eczema, folliculitis, tinea pedis, and xerosis than were women who had not initiated HAART, independent of CD4+ cell count. Participants who had a prior history of a nadir CD4+ cell count of <200 cells/microL and recent CD4+ cell counts of 200-349 cells/microL were more likely to have eczema and xerosis than were women with a nadir CD4+ cell count of >200 cells/microL and recent CD4+ cell counts of >349 cells/microL. An HIV-1 RNA load of >100,000 copies/mL was associated with increased prevalence of herpes zoster infection (odds ratio, 6.10; 95% confidence interval, 2.00-18.65). History of injection drug use was associated with a higher prevalence of onychomycosis, tinea pedis, and xerosis. Molluscum contagiosum was more prevalent among younger women."

HTLV-1/-2 were detected in 1.3% of hepatitis B virus (HBV)- and 5.3% of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected blood samples sent for laboratory viral load measurements. A partial association of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HTLV-1/-2 infection was detected in patients with HCV (HIV+, 27.3%), whereas this association was almost 100% in HBV-infected patients (HIV+, all except one). The high prevalence of HTLV-1/-2 infection among patients with hepatitis C was of concern, as HTLV-1/-2 could change the natural course of subsequent liver disease. The authors suggest including HTLV-1/-2 serology in the battery of tests used when following patients with viral hepatitis in Brazil, regardless of the HIV status."
7856,0.005,1.0000,"Previous investigational data using abacavir (ABC), lamuvidine (3TC), and zidovudine has suggested the possibility of triple nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) therapy as an option in the treatment of HIV infection. We performed a pilot study to assess the potency of once daily ABC+ 3TC+ tenofovir (TDF) in the treatment of HIV-infected naive patients. CD4 and HIV-viral load (VL) were followed monthly. Patients were considered to be nonresponder/failing if there was no reduction in VL by >/= 2 log(10) by week 8 and/or a rebound in VL after initial suppression. Resistance testing was then obtained. Nineteen patients naive to antiretroviral therapy (3 women and 16 men) were enrolled, of whom, 2 did not return (withdrew from study at week 2). Median VL and CD4 count at baseline were 147,167 copies per milliliter (5.16 log(10); [range, 7650->750,000]) and 277 cells/mm(3) (range, 59-598). Eight patients had VL > 100000 at baseline. Of 17 patients eligible for follow-up, 5 (27%) were responders (virologic success). Twelve patients (63%) were considered nonresponders and/or with virologic failure. The study was prematurely interrupted because of a high rate of treatment failure. Resistance testing available for 11 nonresponders (58%) showed: 2 patients with wild-type, 5 patients with M184V (reducing susceptibility to 3TC and ABC), 4 patients with M184V+K65R (K65R is responsible for reducing susceptibility to ABC, 3TC and TDF), and none with K65R alone. In conclusion, the combination of ABC, 3TC and TDF cannot be recommended for the initial regimen in HIV treatment-naive patients."
19434,0.005,1.0000,"The viral dynamics in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection have been studied extensively using mathematical modeling, but data from other primate lentivirus systems are scarce. This study was initiated to increase the understanding of the differences and similarities between the different primate lentiviruses. Four cynomolgus macaques were infected with SIVmac251. Six months after infection the monkeys received a 7-day course of subcutaneous, quadruple antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, tenofovir, and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir. Plasma virus levels were determined before therapy, daily during the first 10 days of therapy, and after 14 days using a sensitive commercial reverse transcriptase assay. All four monkeys showed a rapid and uniform decline in plasma virus load between day 1 and day 4 of treatment (first-phase decay). Two mathematical models, a piecewise linear regression analysis and a nonlinear model, were used to estimate the rate of viral decay in plasma and gave similar results. The mean half-life for plasma virus was 0.47 days (range, 0.37 to 0.50) and reflects the underlying decline of virus-producing CD4+ lymphocytes. This is the fastest primate lentivirus decay described hitherto. The rapid decay may be due to the high antiviral potency of the therapy or to intrinsic differences between simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in macaques and HIV-1 infection in humans."
6597,0.005,1.0000,"Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a neurological disease observed only in 1-2 % of infected individuals. HTLV-1 provirus load, certain HLA alleles and HTLV-1 tax subgroups are reported to be associated with different levels of risk for HAM/TSP in Kagoshima, Japan. Here, it was determined whether these risk factors were also valid for HTLV-1-infected individuals in Mashhad in northeastern Iran, another region of endemic HTLV-1 infection. In Iranian HTLV-1-infected individuals (n=132, 58 HAM/TSP patients and 74 seropositive asymptomatic carriers), although HLA-DRB1*0101 was associated with disease susceptibility in the absence of HLA-A*02 (P=0.038; odds ratio=2.71) as observed in Kagoshima, HLA-A*02 and HLA-Cw*08 had no effect on either the risk of developing HAM/TSP or HTLV-1 provirus load. All Iranian subjects possessed tax subgroup A sequences, and the protective effects of HLA-A*02 were observed only in Kagoshima subjects with tax subgroup B but not in those with tax subgroup A. Both the prevalence of HTLV-1 subgroups and the host genetic background may explain the different risks levels for HAM/TSP development in these two populations."
6000,0.005,1.0000,"Male steady partners of female sex workers (FSW) living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) represent a key population for treatment as prevention and/or pre-exposure prophylaxis interventions. This study uses data collected from male steady partners who were referred by FSW living with HIV participating in a multi-level HIV prevention and care intervention in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. We conducted a socio-behavioral survey and HIV testing with all men (n = 64) and 16 in-depth interviews with a sub-sample to obtain more depth. Thirty-five of the 64 participants were living with HIV; 27 were previously diagnosed and 8 were diagnosed during our study. As a result, 45% of men were members of sero-discordant sexual partnerships. Of men with no previous HIV diagnosis (n = 37), 15 had never been tested for HIV and nine had not been tested in the past two years. Ninety-three percent of men previously diagnosed with HIV reported receiving HIV care in the past 6 months and 78% were taking anti-retrovirals. Low HIV testing was partly due to men not feeling at risk for HIV, despite having an HIV-infected partner. Additionally, a lack of tailored care inhibited engagement in anti-retroviral treatment for those infected. HIV testing was low, highlighting a need for test-and-treat strategies. Men not living with HIV would benefit from regular testing and would be good candidates for pre-exposure prophylaxis. While almost all men who had been diagnosed with HIV were engaged in care and adherent to anti-retroviral therapy, future research should assess whether they are achieving optimal HIV outcomes for their health and prevention of ongoing transmission."

Our objective was to test whether this, and other polymorphisms previously related to fatty liver disease in HIV infection linked to SAMM50 or LPPR4 genes, influence liver fibrosis progression in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals. Three hundred and thirty two HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who consecutively attended four Spanish university hospitals from November 2011 to July 2013 were included. A liver stiffness cut-off of 14.6 kPa, as determined by transient elastography, was used to diagnose cirrhosis. Liver stiffness progression was studied in 171 individuals who had two available LS determinations without anti-HCV treatment between them. Moreover, 28 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who underwent liver transplant, as well as 19 non-cirrhotic coinfected individuals used as controls, were included in an additional study. Only rs738409 was associated with cirrhosis: 45 (29.6%) of 152 G allele carriers versus 36 (20.0%) of 180 CC carriers showed cirrhosis (multivariate p = 0.018; adjusted odds ratio = 1.98; 95% confidence interval = 1.12-3.50). Also, 21 (30.4%) of 69 G allele carriers versus 16 (15.7%) of 102 CC patients showed significant liver stiffness progression (adjusted p-value = 0.015; adjusted odds ratio = 2.89; 95% confidence interval = 1.23-6.83). Finally, the proportion of rs738409 G allele carriers was significantly higher in transplanted individuals than in controls (p = 0.044, odds ratio = 3.43; 95% confidence interval = 1.01-11.70). Our results strongly suggest that the rs738409 polymorphism is associated with liver fibrosis progression in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients."
14071,0.005,1.0000,"Association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) quasispecies and treatment outcome among patients with chronic hepatitis C has been the subject of many studies. However, these studies focused mainly on viral variable regions (E1 and E2) and usually did not include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. The aim of the present study was to analyze heterogeneity of the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) in HCV/HIV coinfected patients treated with interferon and ribavirin. The HCV 5'UTR was amplified from serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples in 37 HCV/HIV coinfected patients treated for chronic hepatitis C. Samples were collected right before treatment, and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 20, 24, 36, 44, 48, 60, and 72 weeks. Heterogeneity of the 5'UTR was analyzed by single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP), cloning and sequencing. Sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved in 46% of analyzed HCV/HIV co-infected patients. Stable SSCP band pattern was observed in 22 patients (62.9%) and SVR rate among these patients was 23%. Decline in the number of bands and/or shift in band positions were found in 6 patients (17.1%), 5 (83%) of whom achieved SVR (p=0.009). A novel viral genotype was identified in all but one of these patients. In 5 of these 6 patients a new genotype was dominant. 5'UTR heterogeneity may correlate with interferon and ribavirin treatment outcome. In the analyzed group of HCV/HIV coinfected patients, viral quasispecies stability during treatment favored viral persistence, whereas decrease in the number of variants and/or emergence of new variants was associated with SVR. Among injection drug users (IDU) patients, a new genotype may become dominant during treatment, probably due to the presence of mixed infections with various strains, which have different susceptibility to treatment."
4534,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 RNA levels as measured by two commercially available quantitative assays were compared before and during zidovudine treatment. HIV-1 RNA levels were measured in stored serum samples from 24 Dutch zidovudine-treated participants of a zidovudine efficacy study (European-Australian Collaborative Group Study 017) at weeks -3, 0, 4 and 8, using quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA; Organon Technika) and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Amplicor; Roche Molecular Systems). HIV-1 RNA copy numbers and changes from baseline as measured by each assay were compared. Individual responses to treatment were compared using definitions based on the within-subject variation of each assay. Before treatment, HIV-1 RNA levels as measured by NASBA were 0.49 logs higher than the levels measured by the Amplicor assay (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32-0.66). During treatment, this difference decreased significantly to 0.27 logs (95% CI 0.01-0.53; difference 0.22 logs; 95% CI 0.05-0.37). The smaller difference between the results of the two assays during treatment was a consequence of a larger decline in RNA level as measured by NASBA compared with that measured by the Amplicor assay (mean change after 4 weeks 0.77 and 0.49 logs, respectively). At week 8, the mean HIV-1 RNA level was still significantly below baseline values as measured by NASBA, but not when measured by the Amplicor assay. Discrepancies in individual responses as measured by the two assays were also observed. In conclusion, marked differences exist between the NASBA and Amplicor quantitative assays, in both HIV-1 RNA copy numbers without treatment and changes in RNA level during treatment. These differences should be considered in interpreting analyses of clinical trials and relationships between HIV-1 RNA level and clinical outcome, as well as in the use of RNA level in the management of HIV-infected patients."
13827,0.005,1.0000,"From last years eighty's decade the number of women with HIV infection have significantly increased. To know the epidemiological and clinic trades in this group we studied retrospectively 476 HIV infected patients attending in a General Hospital from January 1986 to June 1993. Seventy nine (16.5%) were female and 397 male. The mean female group was 25.8 years, 61.9% were IVDUs and 30.4% heterosexual transmission. This last transmission route was more important between females than males (5%) (p < 0.001) and in 1992 the 55% of women been infected by this way. The mean CD4 count was 643 cel/ml in the female group at the diagnostic time and 21.7% developed antigenaemia without difference with the male group. 59.7% of women were no symptoms at the diagnosis time and 14.3% were AIDS, no differences with men, but more in the female group developed AIDS along following time 39.5% in front of 24.7% in the male group (p < 0.05). Disseminated Tuberculosis (DTB) (29.1%) and Wasting Syndrome (WS) (29.1%) were the more frecuent AIDS defining conditions in the female group. The more frecuent complications were: Oropharynx Candidiasis 39.1%, Esophagus Candidiasis 6.3%, WS 11%, DTB 12.65%, PCP 10.12% and Neoplasias 5.06%. Fourteen women became pregnant during HIV infection, no clinical nor immunological differences were observed in this group with the control. The treatment (66%) and following (46.8%), compliance was better between women than men. The rise of women with HIV infection, the poor development in this group described by some authors, so far gynecological aspect and vertical transmission makes HIV infection in women an major health problem."
10626,0.005,1.0000,"The influence of previous structured treatment interruptions (STIs) on the length of time off therapy when highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) is discontinued in chronically HIV-infected subjects was assessed. A comparative, retrospective clinical cohort study included patients with plasma viral load (VL) <50 copies/ml and CD4 cell count >500 cells/mm(3) who interrupted HAART. Fifteen patients interrupted HAART after six 2-weeks-off-/4-weeks-on therapy cycles (STI group) and 30 subjects discontinued HAART without previous STIs (NSTI group). The criteria for treatment resumption were development of AIDS-defining clinical events, VL >100,000 copies/ml or CD4 <350 cells/mm(3). Median (IQR) time off therapy was 48 (29-56) weeks in the STI group and 31 (8-77) weeks in the NSTI group (p < 0.15). After 48 weeks, 46% of the patients in the STI group and 40% in the NSTI group remained off HAART (p < 0.74). No patient developed AIDS-defining events and all but one achieved virological control after treatment resumption. The CD4 nadir was 341 (298-464) cells/mm(3) among patients who reinitiated HAART and 560 (364-682) cells/mm(3) in those who remained off therapy by week 48 (p <0.01). Likewise, CD4 count prior to treatment interruption was 902 (806-1040) cells/mm(3) and 1123 (924-1234) cells/mm(3) in subjects resuming and remaining off HAART, respectively (p = 0.03). No relationship between treatment resumption and pre-ART VL or with the time with undetectable VL before enrollment was found. CD4 nadir was a significant predictor for treatment reinitiation in a multivariate analysis. Previous STIs do not influence time off therapy when HAART is definitively discontinued in chronically HIV-infected subjects. CD4 nadir is an important factor in the treatment discontinuation decision."
19032,0.005,1.0000,Tenofovir (TDF) is an adenosine nucleotide analogue that has been approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. It also shows activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients with or without lamivudine (LAM)-associated mutations.

The aim of this study was to analyse the HBV polymerase (pol) from HIV/HBV-coinfected patients with detectable serum levels of HBV DNA during treatment with TDF for longer than 6 months.
1945,0.005,1.0000,"Widening of the electrocardiographic (ECG) spatial QRS-T angle has been predictive of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in the general population. However, its prognostic significance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients remains unknown. The spatial QRS-T angle was derived from the baseline resting 12-lead electrocardiogram of 4,453 HIV-infected patients aged 43.5 ± 9.3 years from the Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) trial. CVD events were identified during a median follow-up of 28.7 months. Quartiles of the spatial QRS-T angle was calculated for men and women separately, and values in the upper quartile were considered as a widened angle (values >74° for women and >93° for men). A multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to examine the association between a widened baseline spatial QRS-T angle and incident CVD events. During 11,965 person-years of follow-up, 152 CVD events occurred at a rate of 1.27 events/100 person-years. The rate of CVD events in those with a widened spatial QRS-T angle was almost double the rate in those with a normal spatial QRS-T angle (rate ratio 1.94, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 2.69; p <0.001). In a model adjusted for study treatment arm, demographics, CVD risk factors, HIV characteristics, inflammatory markers, and other ECG abnormalities, a widened spatial QRS-T angle was associated with a >50% increased risk of CVD events compared to a normal spatial QRS-T angle (hazard ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.17; p = 0.02). No interaction was seen by SMART trial arm (p value for interaction = 0.37) or gender (p value for interaction = 0.84). In conclusion, a widened spatial QRS-T angle was independently predictive of CVD events in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. This highlights the potential role of routine electrocardiography as a simple noninvasive CVD risk-screening tool in HIV-infected patients."
304,0.005,1.0000,"Previous studies have demonstrated that lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy maintained plasma HIV-1 RNA suppression in a large proportion of antiretroviral naive subjects. However, more subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy experienced confirmed virologic rebound >50 copies/ml compared to a standard three-drug HAART regimen. In this study, we sought to determine the factors associated with maintenance of virologic suppression in subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy. Antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected volunteers were randomized 2:1 to initiate a lopinavir/ritonavir-based combination regimen followed by simplification to lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy or an efavirenz-based triple combination therapy and followed for 96 weeks. Potential predictors of time to loss of virologic response included baseline demographics, baseline HIV-1 RNA levels, baseline CD4(+) T cell counts, adherence as determined by 4-day subject recall, duration of HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml prior to simplification, and lopinavir concentrations. By the Cox proportional hazards model, higher reported adherence levels and higher baseline CD4(+) T cell counts were associated with a greater likelihood of maintaining virologic suppression while receiving lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy. Lopinavir concentrations, including trough concentrations, were not significantly associated with virologic outcomes. This analysis suggests that adherence and higher baseline CD4(+) T cell counts may help to predict who will sustain virologic suppression with lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy. The data also suggest that measuring lopinavir concentrations is not useful in predicting virologic response in these patients."
927,0.005,1.0000,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) have the highest incidence of HIV infection in the United States. One of the contributing factors to HIV spread among this group is the use of crystal methamphetamine (""meth""). The objective was to review the behavioral impact of crystal meth use in HIV-infected MSM and potential treatment options. A systematic review of MEDLINE identified studies that evaluated the clinical effects of crystal meth on the HIV-infected MSM population. Search terms included HIV, methamphetamine, MSM, antiretroviral therapy, adherence, resistance, and treatment. U.S. citations in the English language in peer-reviewed journals until December 2010 were included. The primary author reviewed eligible articles, and relevant data including study design, sample, and outcomes were entered into an electronic data table. The 61 included studies highlight that HIV-infected MSM who use crystal meth are more likely to report high-risk sexual behaviors, incident sexually transmitted infections, and serodiscordant unprotected anal intercourse, compared to HIV-infected MSM who do not use crystal meth. Medication adherence in this population is notably low, which may contribute to transmission of resistant virus. No medications have proven effective in the treatment of crystal meth addiction, and the role of behavioral therapies, such as contingency management are still in question. HIV-infected MSM who abuse crystal meth have worse HIV-related health outcomes. Behavioral interventions have shown variable results in treating crystal meth addiction, and more investigation into rehabilitation options are needed. The results presented support efforts to develop and implement novel interventions to reduce crystal meth use in HIV-infected MSM."
19512,0.005,1.0000,"Although adherence is an important key to the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy (ART), many people living with HIV (PLWH) fail to maintain optimal levels of ART adherence over time. PLWH with the added burden of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection possess unique challenges that potentially impact their motivation and ability to adhere to ART. The present investigation sought to (1) compare ART adherence levels among a sample of HIV/HCV-coinfected versus HIV-monoinfected patients, and (2) identify whether ART-related clinical and psychosocial correlates differ by HCV status. PLWH receiving ART (N = 215: 105 HIV/HCV-coinfected, 110 HIV-monoinfected) completed a comprehensive survey assessing ART adherence and its potential correlates. Medical chart extraction identified clinical factors, including liver enzymes. Results demonstrated that ART adherence did not differ by HCV status, with 83.7% of coinfected patients and 82.4% of monoinfected patients reporting optimal (i.e., ≥95%) adherence during a four-day recall period (p = .809). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that regardless of HCV status, optimal ART adherence was associated with experiencing fewer adherence-related behavioral skills barriers (AOR = 0.56; 95%CI = 0.43-0.73), lower likelihood of problematic drinking (AOR = 0.15; 95%CI = 0.04-0.67), and lower likelihood of methamphetamine use (AOR = 0.14; 95%CI = 0.03-0.69). However, among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, optimal adherence was additionally associated with experiencing fewer ART adherence-related motivational barriers (AOR = 0.23; 95%CI = 0.08-0.62) and lower likelihood of depression (AOR = 0.06; 95%CI = 0.00-0.84). Findings suggest that although HIV/HCV-coinfected patients may face additional, distinct barriers to ART adherence, levels of adherence commensurate with those demonstrated by HIV-monoinfected patients might be achievable if these barriers are addressed."

18588,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment rates for hepatitis C virus (HCV) are low in actual clinical settings. However, the proportion of patients eligible for treatment, especially among those coinfected with HIV, is not well known. Our aim was to determine and compare the rates for HCV treatment eligibility among HCV and HCV-HIV-coinfected persons. We assembled a national cohort of HCV-infected veterans in care from 1998-2003, using the VA National Patient Care Database for demographic/clinical information, the Pharmacy Benefits Management database for pharmacy records, and the Decision Support Systems database for laboratory data. We compared the HCV-monoinfected and HCV-HIV-coinfected subjects for treatment indications and eligibility using current treatment guidelines. Of the 27,452 subjects with HCV and 1225 with HCV-HIV coinfection, 74.0% and 84.6% had indications for therapy and among these, 43.9% of HCV-monoinfected and 28.4% of HCV-HIV-coinfected subjects were eligible for treatment. Anemia, decompensated liver disease (DLD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recent alcohol abuse, and coronary artery disease were the most common contraindications in the HCV, and anemia, DLD, renal failure, recent drug abuse, and COPD in the HCV-HIV-coinfected group. Among those eligible for treatment, only 23% of the HCV-monoinfected and 15% of the HCV-HIV-coinfected subjects received any treatment for HCV. Most veterans with HCV are not eligible for treatment according to the current guidelines. Even for those who are eligible for treatment, only a minority is prescribed treatment. Several contraindications are modifiable and aggressive management of those may improve treatment prescription rates."
6752,0.005,1.0000,"One third of HIV-infected individuals worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Two main reasons justify considering HCV therapy as a priority in HIV-coinfected patients. First, these patients have more rapid liver disease progression, and second, they have a higher risk of developing hepatotoxicity following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Unfortunately, HCV therapy is associated with lower response rates and higher rate of side effects in HIV-coinfected patients. However, recent evidence suggests that when HCV therapy is administered adequately (to optimal candidates; using full doses of ribavirin; at least for 12 months irrespective of the HCV genotype; and with satisfactory drug adherence), treatment responses may not differ much from those seen in HCV-monoinfected individuals. Treatment should be considered up front in antiretroviral-naive subjects with stable HIV infection. In patients already on antiretroviral therapy, HCV therapy should not be administered before replacing didanosine by another antiretroviral, given the increased risk of mitochondrial toxicities. If possible, zidovudine should be avoided as well, given the high risk of anemia. The histological information provided by either non-invasive procedures (FibroScan, Fibro-test, etc.) or liver biopsy is useful but should not be considered as mandatory before prescribing HCV therapy. In summary, liver disease associated to HCV is a growing problem among HIV-positive individuals. The relatively low efficacy of current anti-HCV medications and their low tolerability clearly indicated the need for new drugs with more potent and direct antiviral activity against HCV."

Variations in both SNPs were determined by the TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. In the 286 patients chronically infected by HCV genotypes 1 or 4, both rs14158 CC and rs12979860 CC were associated with a higher rate of sustained virological response (SVR), and these effects were complementary in both HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Thus, 24 % of patients with rs14158/rs12979860 TT-TC/TT-TC, 33 % with TT-TC/CC, 44.2 % with CC/TT-TC, and 75.8 % harboring CC/CC attained SVR (p < 0.001). SC was associated with the IL28B genotype (66.7 % CC in SC vs. 42.6 % among those with chronic infection, p < 0.001) but not with the LDLR genotype. There was no association between GP and the plasma level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or the presence of advanced fibrosis. There is a complementary effect between the IL28B and LDLR genotypes on the probability of achieving SVR after Peg-IFN/RBV therapy in patients with HCV 1 or 4. Thus, the predictive value of IL28B genotype is modulated by the LDLR genotype in both HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. This complementary effect of both genotypes is also observed on the plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)."
1130,0.005,1.0000,"Psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and depression have long been associated with risk behaviors for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). The US prison population is reported to have elevated rates of HIV, hepatitis and most psychiatric disorders. This study examined the association of six major psychiatric disorders with HIV mono-infection, HIV/HCV co-infection and HIV/HBV co-infection in one of the nation's largest prison populations. The study population consisted of 370,511 Texas Department of Criminal Justice inmates who were incarcerated for any duration between January 1, 2003 and July 1, 2006. Information on medical conditions and sociodemographic factors was obtained from an institution-wide electronic medical information system. Offenders diagnosed with HIV mono-infection, HIV/HCV, HIV/HBV and all HIV combined exhibited elevated rates of major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, non-schizophrenic psychotic disorder and any psychiatric disorder. In comparison to offenders with HIV mono-infection, those with HIV/HCV co-infection had an elevated prevalence of any psychiatric disorder. This cross-sectional study's finding of positive associations between psychiatric disease and both HIV infection and hepatitis co-infection among Texas prison inmates holds both clinical and public health relevance. It will be important for future investigations to examine the extent to which psychiatric disorders serve as a barrier to medical care, communication with clinicians and adherence to prescribed medical regimens among both HIV-mono-infected and HIV/hepatitis-co-infected inmates."
12757,0.005,1.0000,"In France a harm-reduction policy was implemented in the late 1980s with the aim of reducing the prevalence of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among drug users. The ANRS-Coquelicot survey was designed to measure the prevalence of HIV and HCV infection among drug users and to examine determinants of at-risk behaviors. In 2002, information was collected from 166 drug users recruited in all types of services specializing in drug use intervention and harm reduction in Marseille, France. Self-reported HIV and HCV serostatus was compared with the results of serological tests done on capillary blood collected on filter paper. The self-reported and biologically documented prevalence rates of HIV infection were identical (22%). In contrast, the self-reported prevalence of HCV infection was 52%, whereas the biologically documented prevalence was 73%. Overall, 30% of HCV-infected drug users were unaware of their status. Forty-four percent of drug users under 30 years of age were HCV seropositive, suggesting that they had been infected early during drug use. The harm-reduction policy seems to have had a marked impact on HIV transmission among drug users but a much more limited impact on HCV transmission. The limitations and implications of the study are discussed."
6049,0.005,1.0000,"A longitudinal study was conducted to investigate the association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, history of major depressive disorder (MDD), and persistent or recurrent MDD among intravenous drug users. Psychiatric disorders were assessed in a sample of HIV-positive (HIV+) and HIV-negative (HIV-) intravenous drug users every 6 months for 3 years. Results indicated that HIV status and baseline MDD independently predicted persistent or recurrent episodes of MDD after gender, drug use, ethnicity, income, and the presence other psychiatric disorders were controlled statistically. Among HIV+ intravenous drug users with baseline MDD, 90% experienced at least one subsequent episode of MDD and 47% experienced at least three subsequent episodes of MDD. However, less than 40% of intravenous drug users with current MDD received treatment for emotional problems. These findings indicate that intravenous drug users with HIV infection and a history of MDD are at considerable risk for future episodes of MDD or recurrent MDD, and that increased provision of treatment for intravenous drug users with MDD may be necessary."
18165,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are both associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), a major complication after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The aim of this study was to assess predictors of post-OLT CKD in HIV/HCV-coinfected recipients versus HIV-infected recipients without HCV (HIV/non-HCV recipients). Data from a National Institutes of Health study of 116 OLT recipients (35 HIV/non-HCV recipients and 81 HIV/HCV-coinfected recipients) from 2003 to 2010 (Solid Organ Transplantation in HIV: Multi-Site Study) were analyzed for the pretransplant CKD prevalence [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/minute for ≥3 months] and the incidence of CKD up to 3 years posttransplant. Proportional hazards models were performed to assess predictors of posttransplant CKD. A contemporaneous cohort of HCV-monoinfected transplant recipients from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database was also analyzed. The median age at transplant was 48 years, the median serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dL, and the median eGFR was 77 mL/minute. Thirty-four patients were suspected to have pretransplant CKD; 20 of these patients (59%) had posttransplant CKD. Among the 82 patients without pretransplant CKD (26 HIV/non-HCV patients and 56 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients), the incidence of stage 3 CKD 3 years after OLT was 62% (55% of HIV/non-HCV patients and 65% of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients), and the incidence of stage 4/5 CKD was 8% (0% of HIV/non-HCV patients and 12% of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients). In a multivariate analysis, older age [[hazard ratio (HR) = 1.05 per year, P = 0.03] and the CD4 count (HR = 0.90 per 50 cells/μL, P = 0.01) were significant predictors of CKD. HCV coinfection was significantly associated with stage 4/5 CKD (HR = 10.8, P = 0.03) after adjustments for age. The cumulative incidence of stage 4/5 CKD was significantly higher for HIV/HCV-coinfected patients versus HIV/non-HCV transplant recipients and HCV-monoinfected transplant recipients (P = 0.001). In conclusion, CKD occurs frequently in HIV-infected transplant recipients. Predictors of posttransplant CKD include older age and a lower posttransplant CD4 count. HCV coinfection is associated with a higher incidence of stage 4/5 CKD."
1476,0.005,1.0000,"Mitochondrial toxicity induced by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) has been reported to be responsible for various adverse effects. The relative impact of NRTIs on the mitochondria of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1)-infected children receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is unknown. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels were quantified longitudinally from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 31 HIV-1-infected children from Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trial Group Study 382 who were receiving HAART, including nelfinavir, efavirenz, and different NRTIs, and who had had undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels for >2 years. The median mtDNA levels in PBMCs increased from 137 copies/cell at the baseline to 179 copies/cell at week 48 (P = 0.01) and 198 copies/cell at week 104 (P < 0.001). Before the initiation of HAART, children who received regimens containing didanosine had mtDNA levels persistently lower than those in children not receiving didanosine (106 versus 140 copies/cell; P = 0.008). During HAART, the median increase in the mtDNA level from the baseline to week 104 was the lowest in children who received regimens containing didanosine (+26 copies/cell) compared to those in children who received other regimens (+79 copies/cell) (P = 0.02). A multivariate analysis also demonstrated that didanosine, as part of HAART, was the only NRTI associated with the change in mtDNA levels (P = 0.007). Children receiving didanosine-containing antiretroviral regimens have the lowest mtDNA levels in PBMCs and may be at greater risk for long-term adverse effects due to mitochondrial toxicity. This may be of particular importance in resource-limited countries where didanosine is widely used for the treatment of HIV-infected children."
18474,0.005,1.0000,"Preeclampsia is a multifactorial pregnancy-specific disease. In some cases, severe preeclampsia and related disorders of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets syndrome are associated with inherited defects in mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids, especially a deficiency of long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCHAD). Recently, an unexplained increase in the incidence of preeclampsia has been documented in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected pregnant women on treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We performed this study to determine if antiretroviral drugs affect mitochondrial beta-oxidation fatty acids in vitro. Two normal and 1 heterozygous LCHAD-deficient cell lines were exposed to up to 5 times the therapeutic concentrations of the following antiretroviral drugs: nevirapine, didanosine, lamivudine, and a combination of nelfinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. One homozygous LCHAD-deficient cell line served as the positive control. After exposure of the fibroblasts to these drugs for periods ranging from 2 to 10 days, accumulations of even-chain 3-hydroxy fatty acids (3-OH-C6 to 3-OH-C18) in the culture media were measured by stable-isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Compared to the respective unexposed fibroblasts, there was no significant build-up of 3-hydroxy fatty acids in the culture media of normal or heterozygous LCHAD-deficient fibroblasts exposed to antiretroviral drugs. Our results show that the commonly used antiretroviral drugs do not adversely affect fatty acid oxidation in fibroblasts. Therefore, an altered fatty acid oxidation may not be the mechanism for the reported increased risk of preeclampsia in HIV-infected pregnant women on HAART."
16037,0.005,1.0000,"Nevirapine (NVP) is an effective nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of particular interest as it is often used in resource limited countries. However, one of the main concerns with the use of NVP is hepatotoxicity and elevation of liver enzymes as a consequence of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) containing NVP is more often reported in HIV patients coinfected with hepatitis C virus than in HIV-monoinfected patients. To discover possible markers of NVP induced hepatotoxicity, serum and urine samples from twenty-five HIV or HIV/HCV patients, all of whom had received NVP continuously for at least four months, and healthy controls were subjected to in-solution or in-gel proteomic analysis. A total of 83 differentially regulated proteins consisted of 34 proteins identified in serum by in-solution analysis, 2 proteins identified from serum in a 2D gel electrophoresis analysis, and 47 proteins identified in urine in an in-solution analysis. Three proteins, namely, haptoglobin, Rho-related BTB domain containing protein 3, and death-associated protein kinase 3, were selected for further validation by Western blot analysis and results showed that haptoglobin has potential for further development as an additional marker of NVP induced hepatotoxicity.

3023,0.005,1.0000,Persistent coinfection with the apathogenic GB virus C (GBV-C) is associated with slower disease progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. Aim of this study was to investigate whether Fas plays a role in this beneficial effect. Fas expression and susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis (FMA) was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HIV-1 patients coinfected and non-coinfected with GBV-C. Fas expression and function was evaluated in 42 GBV-C coinfected and 101 non-coinfected HIV-1 patients. Thirteen healthy and 11 Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-monoinfected individuals were analyzed as controls. Cell surface Fas expression was determined by flow cytometric analysis. Apoptosis was evaluated by staining with Annexin V and Viaprobe followed by multiparameter flow cytometry analysis. In untreated HIV-1 patients GBV-C coinfection was associated with significantly lower percentage of Fas expressing cells as compared to GBV-C non-coinfected individuals. Expression of Fas was directly correlated with sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Sensitivity to FMA was unchanged in GBV-C coinfected patients. PBMCs of patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) did not show such a difference. Untreated HIV-1 patients with GBV-C coinfection have reduced cell surface Fas expression. Lower FMA of T-cells might contribute to prolonged survival of GBV-C coinfected HIV-1 patients.
12224,0.005,1.0000,"Insulin resistance (IR) in the context of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is becoming more common in HIV-infected patients. Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have an increased risk of IR and type 2 diabetes mellitus. A cross-sectional study was performed to investigate whether chronic HCV infection constitutes a risk factor for IR in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients undergoing HAART. Inclusion criteria were positive HCV viremia and a sustained increase of alanine aminotransferase of at least twice the normal value. A total of 29 HIV-HCV patients, 76 HIV patients, and 121 HCV controls were tested for IR and body mass index (BMI). IR was measured using the homeostasis model assessment. In HIV-HCV and HIV patients, fat redistribution and lipid profile were assessed. There was no significant difference in age, CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, or duration of HAART between the HIV-HCV and HIV groups. HIV-HCV patients and HCV controls had a significant increase in IR when compared with HIV patients (0.25 +/- 0.28 and 0.21 +/- 0.34 versus 0.04 +/- 0.37; p =.01 and p =.003, respectively). Lipoatrophy was observed more frequently in HIV-HCV patients in comparison with HIV patients (41% versus 14%; p =.003). In HIV-HCV patients, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly lower than in HIV patients. In multivariate analysis, IR, BMI, triglyceride levels, and peripheral fat wasting were the independent variables associated with HCV infection. Our findings suggest that chronic HCV infection is a significant factor associated with the development of metabolic abnormalities and with modifications in body composition in HIV patients receiving antiretroviral treatment."
12135,0.005,1.0000,"Transaminase elevation is frequently seen in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-HIV-coinfected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), representing an increase in the immune response against HCV and being one of the mechanisms proposed to be involved. There is a report claiming that HCV genotype 3 is an independent risk factor. Our objectives were to assess the incidence of liver toxicity in an HIV-HCV-coinfected population with relatively preserved cellular immunity, and the role of HCV genotypes in the elevation of liver enzymes, both at baseline and after initiating ART. All HIV(+) patients with positive anti-HCV serology and CD4(+) cell counts above 100/mm(3) who began triple ART were identified, and their HCV-RNA levels and HCV genotype were determined. Liver enzymes were determined at baseline and bimonthly during follow-up. Of anti-HCV patients 147 were included, 128 (87.1%) of whom had detectable plasma HCV-RNA. HCV-1 and HCV-4 genotypes were found to confer an increased probability of having at baseline transaminases within normal limits over the other genotypes. Severe transaminase elevations (grades 3 and 4) occurred in 5/124 patients (4.0%), all with high pre-HAART ALT and positive HCV-RNA levels. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with genotype HCV-3 had a 3.27 times higher risk of developing HAART-related transaminase elevations of any grade. In conclusion, subjects with the HCV-1 genotype more often had transaminases within normal limits at baseline. The incidence of severe transaminase elevation after initiating ART was very low (4%) in this HIV(+) population with relatively preserved cellular immunity. HCV genotype 3 was identified as a risk factor for the development of transaminase elevation of any grade."
18026,0.005,1.0000,"Chemotherapy regimens similar to those used for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) not associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been used for patients with HIV-associated NHL with less success. In a recent trial, patients with intermediate or high-grade NHL were randomized to either low-dose chemotherapy with methotrexate, bleomycin, doxorubicin, vincristine and dexamethasone (m-BACOD) or to standard-dose m-BACOD with sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, GM-CSF). With low-dose m-BACOD 41% of patients achieved a complete remission and the median survival was 35 weeks. With standard-dose m-BACOD and sargramostim, the percentage of complete remissions was 52% with a median survival of 31 weeks (P=n.s.). Myelosuppression was greater with standard-dose chemotherapy. In univariate and multivariate analyses of 21 pretreatment features of patients in this trial, four factors emerged as adversely prognostic with respect to survival: age >35 years, intravenous drug use, CD4 counts < 100/mm3 and stage III/IV disease. In an analysis using the proportional hazards model, a ""favorable"" group was defined by patients with 0 or 1 adverse factor (median survival 46 weeks, survival at 144 weeks 29.5%) as compared with an unfavorable group with 3 or 4 adverse factors (median survival 18 weeks, survival at 144 weeks 0). The outcome of these patients may be improving with the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which seems to improve immune function and tolerance of chemotherapy. A recent trial of the AIDS Malignancy Consortium found that low-dose chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone: CHOP) and standard-dose chemotherapy had similar response rates, acceptable toxicity and minimal alterations in cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and indinavir pharmacokinetics in HIV-associated lymphoma patients also on HAART (stavudine, lamivudine and indinavir). There is a suggestion that Burkitt-type lymphomas may tend to occur in HIV-infected patients with relatively well preserved immune function and CD4 cell counts. Recent results from our institution suggest that similar outcomes are achievable with intensive chemotherapy in patients with Burkitt's lymphomas with or without HIV infection. With improved immune status and improved bone marrow function with the use of HAART, it will probably become more possible to treat many patients with aggressive HIV-associated NHL with more intensive treatment regimens."
13994,0.005,1.0000,"In 99 adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) who received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (including 2 nucleoside analogues and 1 or 2 protease inhibitors) for 1 year, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells (including memory and naive subsets) increased similarly among patients with sustained plasma viral load decrease, transient decrease, or no decrease. A linear correlation was observed between the decrease in serum beta(2)-microglobulin concentration (an independent surrogate marker of HIV disease) and the increase in peripheral blood T-cells (CD4(+) and CD8(+)) counts. In vitro, HIV protease inhibitors indinavir and saquinavir (but not nucleoside analogues) enhanced the survival of patients' peripheral blood T cells at doses that are at least 30-fold lower than those required for achieving 90% viral inhibition in the same cultures. This enhanced T-cell survival (which is similar for CD4 and CD8 cells) was associated with a restoration of T-cell proliferative response to immune stimuli. However, neither TCR/CD3-ligation- nor Fas-ligation-triggered apoptosis was affected by either of the 2 protease inhibitors. A reduction in apoptosis observed after prolonged culture of patient T cells in the presence of the protease inhibitors could result from restored T-cell proliferation. These findings explain the discrepancies between virologic and immunologic responses that are increasingly reported in patients receiving HAART, and may provide insights into the pathogenesis of HIV infection."

Among 247 enrolled patients, 179 (72.5%) remained in care, 20 (8.1%) were transferred to other hospitals, 9 (3.6%) died and 39 (15.8%) were lost to follow-up. We compared the demographic, psychosocial, and clinical characteristics between the groups with 100% HVC (n = 166, 67.2%) and ≤ 50% HVC (n = 33, 13.4%). In multivariable analysis, ART-starting age ≤ 30 years (odds ratio [OR] 4.08 vs. > 50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-15.15, P = 0.036), no non-HIV related comorbidity (OR 2.94 vs. comorbidity ≥ 1; 95% CI 1.02-8.49, P = 0.046), baseline CD4 cell count > 300 cells/μL (OR 3.58 vs. ≤ 200; 95% CI 1.33-9.65, P = 0.012) were significant predictable factors of poor RIC.

242,0.005,1.0000,"Evidence demonstrates a substantial HIV epidemic among children and adolescents in countries with long-standing generalized HIV epidemics, where availability of prevention of mother-to-child transmission services has historically been limited. The objective of this research was to explore factors associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and morbidity among HIV-infected surviving children 2-17 years of age attending HIV programs in Central Africa. Programmatic data from 404 children attending HIV programs in Burundi, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) were included in our evaluation. Children were followed prospectively from 2008 to 2011 according to each clinic's standard of care. Diagnosis at a reference hospital was significantly associated with not having initiated ART (adjusted odds ratio, AOR = 0.40; 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.24-0.67). Being seen at a clinic in Cameroon (AOR = 0.45; 95%CI = 0.24-0.85) and being in school were associated with decreased risk (AOR = 0.55; 95%CI = 0.31-0.96). Being ART-naïve (AOR = 1.88; 95%CI = 1.20-2.94) and being diagnosed at a reference hospital (AOR = 2.39; 95%CI = 1.29-4.41) or other testing facility (AOR = 2.86; 95%CI = 1.32-6.18) were associated with increased risk of having a morbid event at the initial visit. In longitudinal analysis of incident morbidity, we found a decreased risk associated with attending clinics in Cameroon (adjusted hazard ratio, AHR = 0.23; 95%CI = 0.11-0.46) and the DRC (AHR = 0.46; 95%CI = 0.29-0.74), and an increased risk associated with being ART-naïve (AHR = 1.83; 95%CI = 1.12-2.97). We found a high burden of HIV-related health problems among children receiving care in this setting. Children face significant barriers to accessing HIV services, and the HIV epidemic among surviving children in the Central African region has not been adequately evaluated nor addressed."

However, a substantial proportion of patients demonstrates <4-fold reduction of titers after recommended therapy (serofast state). It remains unclear whether the serofast state is indicative of persistence of bacteria or only a residual immune response.The aim of the present study was to determine the association between the serofast state and the risk of neurosyphilis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and to identify potential predictors of neurosyphilis.Thirty-three patients with early syphilis and HIV co-infection were included. One year after the recommended treatment of syphilis, all patients who did not achieve proper serologic response underwent lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination.Twelve months after completing therapy for syphilis, the proportion of patients with serofast state after syphilis therapy was 36.4% (n = 12). Among them, 5 (41.7%) had neurosyphilis. Individuals who remained serofast and had neurosyphilis (n = 5) when compared to those without neurosyphilis (n = 7) were characterized by significantly lower CD4+ cell count and higher HIV RNA levels (P < .05). Moreover, a significantly higher proportion of patients with neurosyphilis was not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). The nonreceipt of ART independently increased the risk of neurosyphilis in the analyzed group of serofast HIV-infected patients (odds ratio = 4.5; 95% confidence interval 1.5-13.59, P = .003).Patients co-infected with HIV require careful serologic and clinical follow-up after therapy for syphilis. In all of the patients who do not respond serologically after treatment for syphilis, especially in those who are not receiving ART, lumbar puncture and CSF examination should be considered."
18209,0.005,1.0000,"Despite extensive prevention efforts, an estimated 21% of individuals with HIV/AIDS in the United States are unaware of their status, placing them at greater risk for spreading the virus to others. HIV treatment as prevention (TasP) is rapidly becoming an important public health strategy to reduce HIV transmission at the population level. Data for this study were collected on a sample of 11,397 HIV-positive individuals in the Ryan White system, a publicly funded system of care for HIV-positive individuals in Los Angeles County who are uninsured, in 2009 to examine two components of TasP: baseline rates and factors associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) use and viral load (VL) suppression in a publicly funded system of care. ART coverage among our sample was 90%. In multivariate analyses, those with a higher odds of having unsuppressed VL included: females compared to males (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.06, 1.47); African Americans compared to whites (AOR=1.42; 95% CI=1.24, 1.62); men who have sex with men compared to heterosexuals (AOR=1.15; 95% CI=1.00, 1.32); recent substance abusers compared to nonsubstance abusers (AOR=1.35; 95% CI=1.17, 1.55); those recently incarcerated or ever incarcerated compared to those never incarcerated (AOR=1.37; 95% CI=1.15, 1.63; and AOR=1.28; 95% CI=1.09, 1.50); and those retained in care compared to those not retained in care (AOR=1.98; 95% CI=1.76, 2.22). Understanding the key sociodemographic, geographic and behavioral factors associated with ART use as well as HIV VL suppression will be useful for informing the development and deployment of targeted programming and policies that may further enhance the implementation of the TasP approach in communities across the United States."

The relative importance of various predictors for this poor response has not been fully characterized. In this retrospective cohort study, we examined the relationship between clinical characteristics and vaccine non-response (HB surface antibody <10 IU/L) among patients attending an urban HIV clinic. Among the 97 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 43 (44%) developed a protective antibody response. In multivariate analyses, age >40 years (odds ratio [OR] 3.03 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-8.06]; P = 0.026) and alcohol abuse (OR 4.92 [95% CI, 1.72-20.89]; P = 0.007) were independent predictors of failure to develop vaccine response. In addition, CD4 nadir <200 (OR 7.24 [95% CI, 1.91-27.41]; P = 0.004), rather than CD4 current to vaccination, remained a strong independent risk factor. Patients with HIV viral suppression on highly active antiretroviral therapy had a significantly lower rate of vaccine failure (OR 0.31 [95% CI, 0.11-0.91]; P = 0.033), after adjusting for these other covariates. Our findings underscore the importance of confirming seroconversion after HB vaccination in HIV-infected patients and initiating vaccination early in the course of HIV infection."

The study sample included 39 coinfected adults; 16 in the HCV-treated cohort (who were interviewed a maximum of 3 times) and 23 in the HCV-nontreatment cohort. Analysis of interviews identified 2 treatment barriers (fears and vicarious experiences) and 4 facilitating factors (experience with illness management, patient-provider relationships, gaining sober time, and facing treatment head-on). Analysis of these data also revealed a preliminary model to guide intervention development and theoretical perspectives. Ultimately, research is urgently needed to test interventions that improve HCV evaluation and treatment uptake among HIV-infected patients."

We conducted a cohort study of HIV/HCV coinfected women followed in the multicenter Women's Interagency HIV Study to determine the association of self-reported race/ethnicity with all-cause and liver-related mortality. Survival analyses were performed using Cox's proportional hazards models. The eligible cohort (n = 794) included 140 Caucasians, 159 Hispanics, and 495 African Americans. There were 438 deaths and 49 liver-related deaths during a median follow-up of 8.9 years and maximum follow-up of 16 years. African-American coinfected women had significantly lower liver-related mortality, compared to Caucasian (hazard ratio [HR], 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.19-0.88; P = 0.022) and Hispanic coinfected women (HR, 0.38; 95% CI: 0.19-0.76; P = 0.006). All-cause mortality was similar between racial/ethnic groups (HRs for all comparisons: 0.82-1.03; log-rank test: P = 0.8)."
16809,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) appears to adversely affect hepatitis C, but whether hepatitis C virus (HCV) has a reciprocal effect on HIV-1 infection remains a point of controversy. In a multivariate analysis of a cohort of 5832 individuals, we found that individuals coinfected with HCV and HIV-1 (prevalence of coinfection, 5.8%) had a CD4+ cell count that decreased at a rate similar to that for individuals infected with HIV-1 alone. However, coinfection was associated with a statistically significant increased likelihood of onset of an acquired immunodeficiency syndromedefining illness or developing a CD4+ cell count of <200 cells/mm3, compared with infection with HIV-1 alone (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.072.17). Patients who were naive to highly active antiretroviral therapy were significantly less likely to progress to either end point, because of their higher CD4+ cell counts. In conclusion, there was an increased number of adverse events in coinfected individuals, compared with individuals infected with HIV-1 alone."
8884,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated maternal sexual behavior and injection drug use practices as possible risk factors for vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Data were analyzed from the Mothers and Infants Cohort Study, a prospective study in Brooklyn and the Bronx, New York. A total of 207 mother-infant sets were enrolled between 1986 and 1991 and followed for up to 4 years after the enrollment visit during pregnancy. HIV-1 transmission occurred in 49 of 201 mother-infant sets, yielding an overall transmission rate of 24.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 18.7% to 31.0%). Increased frequency of vaginal intercourse after the first trimester of pregnancy was positively associated with vertical transmission of HIV-1 (trend p = 0.03). A lifetime history of injection drug use was not associated with vertical transmission. However, a history of combined cocaine and heroin injection after the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with vertical HIV-1 transmission, particularly among women with CD4+ lymphocyte levels of 20% or higher (risk ratio = 4.0; 95% CI = 2.0 to 8.1). Cocaine and heroin injection drug use after the first trimester accounted for most of the relation between preterm birth and vertical HIV-1 transmission in this cohort. Maternal coinfection with hepatitis C virus or human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II could not explain these observations, because coinfection with these viruses had no detectable effect on HIV-1 transmission. These results suggest that maternal sexual behavior and injection drug use practices during the second and third trimester of pregnancy may modify the risk of vertical HIV-1 transmission."
706,0.005,1.0000,"HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are each associated with reduced bone mineral density, but it is unclear whether HIV/HBV coinfection is associated with an increased risk of fracture. We determined whether dually treated HIV/HBV patients had a higher incidence of hip fracture compared to treated HBV-monoinfected, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated HIV-monoinfected and HIV/HBV-uninfected patients. We conducted a cohort study among 4156 dually treated HIV/HBV-coinfected, 2053 treated HBV-monoinfected, 96,253 ART-treated HIV-monoinfected, and 746,794 randomly sampled uninfected persons within the US Medicaid populations of California, Florida, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania (1999-2007). Coinfected patients were matched on propensity score to persons in each comparator cohort. Weighted survival models accounting for competing risks were used to estimate cumulative incidences and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of incident hip fracture for dually treated coinfected patients compared to (i) HBV-monoinfected receiving nucleos(t)ide analogue or interferon alfa therapy, (ii) HIV-monoinfected on ART and (iii) uninfected persons. Dually treated coinfected patients had a higher cumulative incidence of hip fracture compared to ART-treated HIV-monoinfected (at 5 years: 1.70% vs 1.24%; adjusted HR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.03-1.83]) and uninfected (at 5 years: 1.64% vs 1.22%; adjusted HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.03-1.84]) persons. The cumulative incidence of hip fracture was higher among coinfected than treated HBV-monoinfected patients (at 5 years: 0.70% vs 0.27%), but this difference was not statistically significant in competing risk analysis (adjusted HR, 2.62 [95% CI, 0.92-7.51]). Among Medicaid enrollees, the risk of hip fracture was higher among dually treated HIV/HBV-coinfected patients than ART-treated HIV-monoinfected and uninfected persons."
4517,0.005,1.0000,"Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has shown in vitro activity against both HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of TDF (300 mg/d), administered as a part of anti-retroviral therapy, in a large cohort of HIV/HBV-coinfected patients. Sixty-five HIV/HBV-coinfected patients who received TDF for at least 6 months with serum HBV DNA levels above 2.3 log10 copies/mL at TDF initiation and who had stored serum samples before and during TDF therapy were included. Serum HBV DNA was measured on stored samples. The median follow-up period was 12 (Q1-Q3: 8-17) months. Serum hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) was positive in 54 patients (83.1%). Fifty-two patients (80.0%) were receiving lamivudine (LAM) (150 mg twice a day), and 68.8% had documented LAM resistance at baseline. Among HBeAg-positive patients, the median reduction from baseline (8.17; Q1-Q3 = 7.30-8.30 log10 copies/mL) of serum HBV DNA was 4.56 log10 copies/mL (Q1-Q3 = 3.33-5.55) (P < .0001). In HBeAg-negative patients, serum HBV DNA decline from baseline (4.83; Q1-Q3 = 2.69-6.40 log10 copies/mL) was 2.53 log10 copies/mL (Q1-Q3 = 0.39-4.10). At the end of the study, HBV DNA became undetectable in 29.6% and 81.6% of the HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients, respectively. Serum HBeAg became negative in 4 patients, 2 of whom acquired serum hepatitis B e antibody. In conclusion, this retrospective analysis demonstrates the efficacy of TDF against wild-type, presumed precore mutants and LAM-resistant HBV when used as a part of anti-retroviral therapy in HIV-coinfected patients."
17076,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy has been incompletely examined among HIV-infected patients. We assessed changes in interferon and ribavirin adherence and evaluated the relationship between adherence and early (EVR) and sustained virologic response (SVR). We performed a cohort study among 333 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who received pegylated interferon and ribavirin between 2001 and 2006 and had HCV RNA before and after treatment. Adherence was calculated over 12-week intervals using pharmacy refills. Mean interferon and ribavirin adherence declined 2.5 and 4.1 percentage points per 12-week interval, respectively. Among genotype 1/4 patients, EVR increased with higher ribavirin adherence, but this association was less strong for interferon. SVR among these patients was higher with increasing interferon and ribavirin adherence over the first, second, and third, but not fourth, 12-week intervals. Among HIV/HCV patients, EVR and SVR increased with higher interferon and ribavirin adherence. Adherence to both antivirals declined over time, but more so for ribavirin."
6580,0.005,1.0000,"Tenofovir disoproxil fumerate (TDF) is an effective nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for HIV infection but it is potentially nephrotoxic. A selective mithochondrial toxicity has been hypothesized. To assess early markers of renal toxicity, we evaluated a cohort of antiretroviral (ARV)-experienced HIV patients who had been switched from a thymidinic backbone to either a TDF/emtricitabine regimen (TDF; 73 patients) or an abacavir/lamivudine (ABV) regimen (28 patients). Markers of mitochondrial toxicity (cytochrome c, Cyc) or cytosolic (α-glutathione S transferase, α-GST) together with common indicators of renal damage were assessed at baseline (T0) and after 1 (T1), 3 (T2), 6 (T3), and 12 (T4) months of patient exposure to therapy. Clinical features of both groups were comparable at T0. There was no significant variation in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGRF), median urine protein excretion, or microalbuminuria and serum phosphate levels in both groups during the study period. There was a significant increase in urinary excretion of phosphate in patients on TDF compared to those on ABV at T3 and T4. Fractional excretion of uric acid was also altered in the two treatment groups; there was no change in the ABV (constantly less than 0.10), but a progressive increase in TDF patients. Serum potassium levels were significantly lower in ABV than in TDF treated patients. Urine concentrations of α-GST showed a nonsignificant variation in both groups, while Cyc excretion was significantly higher at T1 and T3 in TDF-treated compared to ABV-treated patients. In conclusion, TDF may be associated with subclinical mitochondrial damage, inducing at a later stage increased urinary excretion of phosphate and uric acid, as markers of incipient tubular injury."
11696,0.005,1.0000,"This study aimed to assess attitudes and potential barriers towards treatment in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, comparing those with and without HIV coinfection. A cross-sectional survey of 82 HCV-infected adults with and without HIV was conducted in greater Los Angeles between November 2013 and July 2015. Overall, there were 53 (64.6%) with HIV coinfection, 20 (25.0%) with self-reported cirrhosis, and 22 (26.8%) with a history of prior HCV treatment. Of all, 93.2% wanted HCV treatment, but 45.9% were unwilling/unable to spend anything out of pocket, 29.4% were waiting for new therapies, and 23.5% were recommended to defer HCV treatment. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were more likely to want treatment within one year (90.2% versus 68.2%, p = 0.02), more willing to join a clinical trial (74.5% versus 8.0%, p < 0.01), more willing to take medications twice daily (86.3% versus 61.5%, p = 0.01), and more likely to prefer hepatitis C treatment by an infectious diseases/HIV physician (36.7% versus 4.0%, p < 0.01). Of all, 77.1% of coinfected patients were willing to change antiretroviral therapy if necessary to treat HCV, but only 48.0% of patients were willing to take a medication if it had not been studied in HIV-positive patients. Treatment preferences differ between HIV/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected patients. Despite a strong willingness among the study cohort to start HCV treatment, other factors such as cost, access to medications, and provider reluctance may be delaying treatment initiation."
937,0.005,1.0000,"A genotyping assay was used to define human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase codons in plasma samples from 80 HIV-1 patients extensively treated with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase (zidovudine and lamivudine) and one non nucleoside reverse transcriptase (nevirapine) inhibitor. The frequencies of T215S/Y/F, M41L, D67N, L210W K70R, K219Q mutations, detectable in plasma samples, conferring resistance to zidovudine were 61.2, 56.2, 36.2, 31.5, 27.5 and 17.5%, respectively. Mutations (M184V or M184I) conferring resistance to lamivudine were detected in an extremely high percentage of patients (61%). Among mutations correlated to high (K103N, V106A, Y181C/I, Y188C/H/L, G190A/C/E/Q/S/T) or moderate (V108I, V118I) levels of nevirapine resistance, the predominant amino acid change was a substitution at 103 codon, present in 24 of 80 samples tested. Finally Q151M, the marker mutation able to confer resistance to all nucleoside analogues, was detected in seven patients with a viral load of between 1 x 10(4) and 9 x 10(4) HIV-1 RNA copies/ml. The relationship between the genotype and the viral load showed that the incidence of some specific mutations [M41L, T215Y (correlated to zidovudine resistance) and K103N (correlated to all NNRTIs drugs)] significantly (P=0.001) increased with higher viral load. Our results, albeit limited to a small cohort, showed a high frequency of mutations correlated to drugs in use, suggesting a need for therapeutic change in the near future and demonstrating that the development of genotyping tests helps to guide the therapeutic management of HIV-1 infected people. Our data highlight the dangers of selecting antiretroviral therapy without previous antiretroviral drug testing. Although the cost of these assays is a concern, prescribing inefficacious drugs could create serious problems for HIV-1 patients."
8876,0.005,1.0000,"Liver disease is a leading cause of mortality among HIV-infected persons in the highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) era. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) co-infection is prevalent in, and worsened by HIV; consequently many co-infected persons require liver transplantation (LT). Despite the need, post-LT outcomes are poor in co-infection. We examined predictors of outcomes post-LT. Immunologic biomarkers of immune activation, microbial translocation, and Th1/Th2 skewing were measured pre-LT in participants enrolled in a cohort of HIV infected persons requiring solid organ transplant (HIVTR). Predictive biomarkers were analyzed in Cox-proportional hazards models; multivariate models included known predictors of outcome and biomarkers from univariate analyses. Sixty-nine HIV-HCV co-infected persons with available pre-LT samples were tested: median (IQR) CD4+ T-cell count was 286 (210-429) cells mm-3; 6 (9%) had detectable HIV RNA. Median (IQR) follow-up was 2.1 (0.7-4.0) years, 29 (42%) people died, 35 (51%) had graft loss, 22 (32%) were treated for acute rejection, and 14 (20%) had severe recurrent HCV. In multivariate models, sCD14 levels were significantly lower in persons with graft loss post-LT (HR 0.10 [95%CI 0.02-0.68]). IL-10 levels were higher in persons with rejection (HR 2.10 [95%CI 1.01-4.34]). No markers predicted severe recurrent HCV. Monocyte activation pre-LT may be mechanistically linked to graft health in HIV-HCV co-infection."
4669,0.005,1.0000,"Depression is a common comorbidity among HIV-infected individuals. We studied the relationship between depressive symptoms, risk behaviors (risky-sexual behavior, tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use) and HIV outcomes. This cross-sectional study conducted in 2009 at the Washington University HIV Clinic included screening for depression with patient health questionnaire, survey of sexual behavior, illicit drug, alcohol, and tobacco use within 30 days. Sociodemographics, plasma HIV RNA levels, CD4 cell counts, and sexually transmitted disease test results were obtained from medical records. Multivariate logistic and linear regression models were used to assess the association between depressive symptoms severity and risk behaviors, HIV outcomes and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) adherence. A total of 624 persons completed the assessment of whom 432 (69%) were male and 426 (68%) African-American. The median CD4 cell count was 410 cells/mm(3) and 479 persons (77%) were on cART of whom 112 (23%) had HIV RNA level > 400 copies/mL. Overall, 96 (15%) had symptoms of major depressive disorder. Depressive symptom severity was associated with increased likelihood of high-risk drinking (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-5.1), current tobacco use (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.9), illicit drug use (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-2.8), and risky-sexual behavior (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.8-2.7). Suboptimal cART adherence (visual analog scale < 95%) was also associated with depressive symptoms severity (p < 0.05). After adjustment for age, sex, race, receipt of cART, and cART adherence, depressive symptoms severity was independently associated with lower CD4 cell count (p < 0.05) but not with higher HIV RNA level (p = 0.39). Depression adversely affects HIV-infected individuals, requiring greater effort at utilizing multidisciplinary interventions."
10425,0.005,1.0000,"Maternal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA load, vertical transmission of subtype C HIV, and infant mortality were examined in 251 HIV-seropositive women and their infants in Zimbabwe. Demographic characteristics, health and medical histories, serum HIV RNA loads, and CD4+ lymphocyte counts for mothers were examined by logistic regression analysis to determine significant risk factors and their odds ratios for transmission and infant mortality. Tenfold (1 log10) incremental increases in maternal HIV RNA were associated with a 1.9-fold increase (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.9) in transmission and a 2.1-fold increase (95% CI, 1.3-3.5) in infant mortality (P<.01). Maternal CD4 cell counts and demographic and medical characteristics were not significant predictors of transmission. However, maternal CD4 cell counts below the median (400/mm3) were significantly associated with infant mortality (P=. 035, Fisher's exact test). The maternal level of serum HIV is an important determinant of vertical transmission and infant mortality in subtype C infection in Zimbabwe."
8929,0.005,1.0000,"An investigation was conducted involving 255 renal transplant recipients in the state of Goiás, Central Brazil, to determine the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV), its risk factors, the genotypes involved, and the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) present in the patients. All serum samples were tested for anti-HCV antibodies and HCV RNA. Forty-one patients were anti-HCV and/or HCV RNA positive, resulting in an overall HCV infection prevalence of 16.1% (95% CI: 11.9-21.3). A multivariate analysis of risk factors showed that a history of blood transfusions without anti-HCV screening, the length of time spent on hemodialysis, and renal transplantation before 1994 are all associated with HCV positivity. In HCV-positive patients, only 12.2% had ALT levels above normal. Twenty-eight samples were genotyped as genotype 1, subtypes 1a (62.5%) and 1b (31.3%), and two samples (6.2%) were genotype 3, subtype 3a. These data show a high prevalence of HCV infection and low ALT levels in the studied population. The risk factor analysis findings emphasize the importance of public health strategies such as anti-HCV screening of candidate blood and organ donors, in addition to the stricter adoption of hemodialysis-specific infection control measures. The present study also demonstrates that HCV genotype 1 (subtype 1a) is predominant in this population."
7611,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic viral hepatitis C and B are one of the major public health and medical problems. Both viruses cause life threatening liver diseases, i.e. cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Effective treatment for both hepatitis B and hepatitis C to reduce the rate of adverse outcomes is now available. There is no recommendation for mass screening for HBV and HCV in the general population but only in the high risk groups. There is wide availability of diagnostic tests for HCV and HBV infection with high sensitivity and specificity. Prior to therapy initiation, serum HCV RNA by quantitative assay and HCV genotype should be determined. Liver biopsy is performed to assess the disease severity, not always including genotype 3. Response to antiviral therapy should be assessed by AST, ALT and qualitative HCV RNA, and in patients with liver cirrhosis early detection of HCC by alpha fetoprotein, ultrasound, CT, or MR should be done every 6 months. Chronic HCV infection with cirrhosis and HCC is the leading indication for liver transplantation. The current hepatitis B vaccination policy is universal neonatal vaccination. HBsAg, HbBeAg and antiHBe positive patients should be qualitatively tested for HBV DNA and liver biopsy is performed according HBV DNA level. Patients are treated with interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogues. Treated patients should be tested for HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA every 3 and 6 months. The optimal duration of therapy for oral drugs is not well established and life long treatment is generally recommended. Chronic HBV infection is the leading cause of HCC and its early detection is essential. Liver transplantation is successfully performed for HBV cirrhosis, liver failure and HCC. Patients with HBV/HDV, HBV/HCV or HIV/HBV/HCV co-infection should be treated accordingly. TTV, GBV-C and HEV hepatitis do not cause chronic liver diseases."
16885,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C infection is a major public health problem worldwide. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been identified as a major causative agent of post-transfusion hepatitis. The host immune response to HCV infection is composed of both non- specific immune response, including interferon (IFN) production and natural killer (NK) cell activity and a virus-specific immune response, including humoral and cellular components. Susceptibility to infection has been related to immunological disturbances. Several studies have provided experimental evidence of disorders of both cellular and humoral immunity. Humoral Immunity is dependent mainly on immunoglobulins and little data are available about serum immunoglobulin values in chronic hepatitis C. The present study aimed to evaluate humoral immune response by measuring the concentration of serum immunoglobulin isotypes (IgG, IgM, IgA) and IgG-subclasses level (IgG1-4) in chronic hepatitis C patients and healthy controls. This study included 50 patients with chronic hepatitis C. All of them had positive serum anti-HCV antibodies, positive serum HCV-RNA by PCR, and histologically-proven chronic hepatitis. The results were compared with 25 healthy controls. Total IgG, IgA and IgM were assayed by nephelometry. IgG subclasses were assayed using human IgG subclasses enzyme immunoassay. Serum protein electrophoresis was performed in agarose gel. The results showed that no significant difference in serum immunoglobulin levels were found among patients with chronic hepatitis C of minimal liver damage( Knodell index < or =3) and patients with mild liver disease (Knodell index > 3). A significant increase in total serum IgG, IgG1 and IgG2 levels were found in patients with chronic hepatitis than in healthy controls but no difference was found in IgG3 and IgG4 in both patients and controls. Mean serum IgM was increased in patients with HCV infection compared with healthy controls. No significant difference was found in IgA level in both the patients and healthy controls. Our data revealed an increase of humoral immune response in chronic hepatitis C infection. This is evidenced by an elevation in serum immunoglobulin isotypes; IgG and its subclasses IgG1 and IgG2 and IgM. These findings may provide some new insights into the antibody response to HCV."
15783,0.005,1.0000,"Limited information is available on the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the general population in China. A community-based epidemiological study was conducted in three counties in eastern China. A total of 149 175 individuals were investigated in 60 communities in three counties in Jiangsu province, eastern China, of whom 1175 subjects [0·79%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·74-0·83] were HCV antibody positive. The prevalence was low in children (0·09%, 95% CI 0·04-0·17), but increased progressively from adolescents (0·20%, 95% CI 0·15-0·28) to adults aged ⩾21 years (95% CI 0·15-1·64). Women had a higher prevalence of HCV infection than men in most age groups. In a multilevel regression analysis, age, sex, education, occupation, blood transfusion [odds ratio (OR) 2·91, 95% CI 1·09-5·37], invasive testing (OR 1·28, 95% CI 1·14-1·61), and dental therapy (OR 2·27, 95% CI 1·41-3·42) were associated with HCV infection. In conclusion, although the prevalence of HCV in this population was lower than reported from national levels, the total reservoir of infection is significant and warrants public health measures, such as health education to limit the magnitude of the problem.

Method We searched Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed ePubs, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through June 2016. Independent observational studies of elevated aPL antibodies in patients with a viral infection compared with controls or patients with lupus were included. Results We analyzed 73 publications for 60 studies. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were most commonly reported. Compared with healthy controls, patients with HIV were more likely to develop elevated anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies (risk ratio (RR) 10.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.6-19.4), as were those with HCV (RR 6.3, 95% CI 3.9-10.1), hepatitis B virus (HBV) (RR 4.2, 95% CI 1.8-9.5), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (RR 10.9 95% CI 5.4-22.2). The only statistically significant increased risk for anti-β2-glycoprotein I (anti-β2-GPI) antibodies was observed in patients with HCV (RR 4.8 95% CI 1.0-22.3). Compared with patients with lupus, patients with HIV were more likely to develop elevated aCL antibodies (RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.6), and those with EBV, elevated anti-β2-GPI antibodies (RR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.9). Thromboembolic events were most prevalent in patients with elevated aPL antibodies who had HCV (9.1%, 95% CI 3.0-18.1), and HBV (5.9%, 95% CI 2.0-11.9) infections, and pregnancy events were most prevalent in those with parvovirus B19 (16.3%, 95% CI 0.78-45.7). However, compared to virus-infected patients with negative aPL antibodies, the only statistically significant increased risk was observed in those with HCV and positive aPL. Conclusions Viral infection can increase the risk of developing elevated aPL antibodies and associated thromboembolic events. Results are contingent on the reported information."
7254,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are 2 types of potentially life-threatening liver diseases with high infection rate. Body piercing represents a progressively popular sociocultural phenomenon which is also a potential exposure approach for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Conclusions from those researches with statistically risk assessment of body piercing on HBV and HCV transmission are contradictory.Systematically analyze the association between body piercing and the risk of transmitting hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus for general population. Make evidence-based recommendations to the current practice and wake up public awareness of this health-threatening behavior.Comprehensive and high sensitivity search strategies were performed to exhaustively search related studies before 15 January 2015 (MEDLINE, EMBASE, WANFANG, CNKI datasets for published literatures, and Google and Google scholars for related grey articles). Two authors identified relevant studies for the review, abstracted data, and assessed literature quality independently and critically according to the selection criteria and quality assessment standard. Odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to estimate risk of HBV and HCV infection in relation to body piercing status. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted to examine the source of heterogeneity and test the robust of the results.A total of 40 studies were included in this systematic review (10 for Hep-B, 26 for Hep-C, 4 for both Hep-B and Hep-C), the pooled OR (95% CI) for the association between body piercing and transmission of HBV/HCV is 1.80 (1.18, 2.75) and 1.83 (1.27, 2.64), respectively. Subgroup analysis suggested that highest risk of body piercing related to hepatitis C infection was for former soccer and veterans with OR of 4.63 (2.65, 8.10), while strongest association between body piercing and hepatitis B was for samples derived from students/community with OR of 2.40 (1.44, 4.02).The current systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that body piercing is significantly associated with the transmission of HBV as well as HCV, having body piercing probably can increase the risk of getting infected. Evidence from this study strongly recommends that comprehensive and effective programs should be established to provide safer piercing practice. "
18315,0.005,1.0000,"To ascertain whether hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection affects the progression of HIV infection, we initiated an eight-year prospective observational study at a university hospital in Taiwan where seroprevalences of HCV antibody and HIV antibody were low. Fifty-three (12.0%) consecutive non-haemophiliac HIV1-infected patients with HCV co-infection and 387 (88.0%) patients without HCV and hepatitis B co-infection were enrolled between June 1994 and June 2002 and observed until December 2002. Outcomes evaluated included the risk for acute hepatitis, hepatic decompensation, HIV disease progression and mortality, and changes of CD4+ count and plasma viral load (PVL) after initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the end of the study. The baseline CD4+ count, PVL and proportion of patients with AIDS-defining opportunistic illnesses (OI) at study entry were similar between patients with HCV co-infection and those without co-infection, but HCV-co-infected patients were older (39 versus 35 years, P = 0.01) and had a higher proportion of intravenous drug use (17.0% versus 0.8%, P < 0.001). After a total observation duration of 1137 patient-years (PY) (median, 791 days; range, 3-3053 days), the incidence of acute hepatitis in HCV-co-infected patients was 13.89 per 100 PY (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.31-14.49) and that in patients without co-infection was 6.39 per 100 PY (95% CI, 6.24-6.55 per 100 PY), with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.769 (95% CI, 1.652-4.640). At the end of the study, CD4+ count increased by 137 x 10(6) and 157 x 10(6)/L in patients with and without HCV co-infection, respectively, (P = 0.47). The proportions of achieving undetectable PVL (<400 copies/mL) after HAART was similar (76.7% versus 74.9%, P = 0.79). The adjusted OR for development of new AIDS-defining OI was 1.826 (95% CI, 0.738-4.522) in HCV-co-infected patients as compared with HCV- uninfected patients. The adjusted hazards ratio for death of HCV-co-infected patients when compared with those without co-infection was 0.781 (95% CI, 0.426-1.432). Our findings suggested that HCV co-infection was associated with a significantly higher risk for acute hepatitis in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, but it had no adverse impact on virological, immunological and clinical responses to HAART and survival when compared with patients without HCV and HBV co-infection."
11887,0.005,1.0000,"Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a serious complication of solid organ transplantation. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been linked to increased risk of lymphoma among immunocompetent individuals. We therefore investigated the association between HCV infection and PTLD in a retrospective cohort study of all individuals in the United States who received their first solid organ transplant from 1994 to 2005 (N = 210 763) using Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data. During follow-up, 1630 patients with PTLD were diagnosed. HCV prevalence at transplantation was 11.3%. HCV infection did not increase PTLD risk in the total cohort (Cox regression model, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.05), even after adjustment for type of organ transplanted, indication for transplantation, degree of HLA mismatch, donor type, or use of immunosuppression medications. Additional analyses also revealed no association by PTLD subtype (defined by site, pathology, cell type, and tumor Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] status). HCV infection did increase PTLD risk among the 2.8% of patients (N = 5959) who were not reported to have received immunosuppression maintenance medications prior to hospital discharge (HR = 3.09; 95% CI, 1.14-8.42; P interaction = .007). Our findings suggest that HCV is not a major risk factor for PTLD, which is consistent with the model in which an intact immune system is necessary for development of HCV-related lymphoproliferation."
2432,0.005,1.0000,"Risk factors associated with the occurrence of protease inhibitor (PI)-related severe and serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs) were analyzed in a prospective cohort of 1155 patients who initiated PI-containing therapy. During a total follow-up of 2037 patient-years, 169 SADRs were reported, yielding a rate of 8 incidents per 100 patient-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.8-8.6). The most frequent SADRs were elevated transaminase levels (in 49 events); renal colic (27); abnormal hematological findings (23); and metabolic (18), neuromuscular (7), pancreatic (6), cutaneous (6), cardiovascular (5), and psychiatric disorders (5). Among baseline characteristics, plasma human immunodeficiency virus RNA levels of >or=5 log(10) copies/mL (hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2), elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels (HR, 1.1 for each 20 IU of elevation; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2), creatinine clearance levels of <70 mL/min (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.7), test results positive for hepatitis C virus antibodies or hepatitis B surface antigenemia (HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.8-3.7), and receipt of indinavir (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4) were independently predictive of a SADR. SADRs were frequent in the first 4 months after initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy but continued to occur after that time period."
17771,0.005,1.0000,"South Africa has the highest prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the world. The improved life expectancy, due to the recent introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), may lead to an increased health burden related to metabolic disorders, resulting in an increased pressure on health-care services. The main objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, obesity and dyslipidemia in a sample of HAART-treated HIV infected patients, attending an HIV clinic in the Gauteng province. This was a cross-sectional study of 304 HIV positive patients enrolled between January 2009 and March 2009, including patients aged 18 to 45 years, on HAART for more than one year. Hypertension prevalence was 19.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 14.7-23.5): 23.9% in men and 17.7% in women (P=0.10). Diabetes was diagnosed in 4 women. Hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol >5.00 mmol/mL) was found in 32.2% (95% CI 27.0-37.5), low HDL cholesterol (<1.20 mmol/mL) in 45.7% (95% CI 40.1-51.3) and elevated LDL cholesterol (>4.10 mmol/mL) in 9.5% (95% CI 6.2-12.8); these prevalences were not different between sexes, whereas hypertriglyceridemia (>2.25 mmol(mL) (15.8%, 95% CI 11.7-19.9) was significantly more frequent in men (28.4% versus 12.2%, P=0.002). TC and LDL-C were positively correlated with CD4+ cell count (r=0.13, P=0.03 and r=0.12, P=0.03). In this sample, the traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease had a high prevalence, despite the young age of our patients. Women seemed to be at higher risk than man, unlike other HIV populations where these comparisons were made (Uganda, Italy and Norway). Obesity and lipid abnormalities, highly prevalent in the general population, also appeared related to HIV-infection and CD4+ cell count, presumably as a consequence of ART exposure. Further studies are needed in order to survey a population where HIV infection is turning into a chronic disease, with its complications."
3138,0.005,1.0000,"Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces plasma HIV RNA viral load (VL) to undetectable levels and its effectiveness depends on consistent adherence. Consistent adherence and use of safe sex practices may substantially decrease the risk of HIV transmission. We sought to explore the potential association between self-reported nonadherence to ART and engaging in unsafe sexual practices capable of transmitting HIV. Using clinical and audio computer-assisted self-interview data from the prospective HIV Outpatient Study from 2007 to 2014, we assessed the frequency of self-reported ART nonadherence during the three days prior to the survey among HIV-infected persons in care and factors associated with self-reported ART nonadherence. Of 1729 patients included in this analysis (median age = 48 years, 74.3% men who have sex with men), 17% were nonadherent, 15% had a detectable VL, and 42% reported condomless anal or vaginal sex in the past six months. In multivariable analysis, self-reported nonadherence was independently associated with younger age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.8 per additional ten years, [95% CI] 0.7-1.0), non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity (aOR 1.9; 95% CI 1.4-2.6 versus white), public health insurance (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.3 compared with private), survey date in 2011-2014 versus 2007-2010 (aOR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9), CD4 cell count ≥ 500 versus < 200 cells/mm"
7765,0.005,1.0000,"In order to define the risk factors for infection with hepatitis C virus, the authors determined the prevalence and incidence of antibodies to hepatitis C in three cohorts in Baltimore, Maryland, enrolled in prospective studies of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. Among 500 multi-transfused patients who underwent cardiac surgery in 1985 and 1986, 12 (2.4%) were hepatitis C seropositive before surgery while 19 (3.9%) developed antibodies in the 8-12 months after surgery. The seroprevalence of hepatitis C virus among 225 intravenous drug users followed since 1988 was 85%, which did not vary by HIV-1 status. Longer duration of intravenous drug use was significantly associated with hepatitis C seropositivity. Among 926 homosexual/bisexual men followed since 1984, 15 (1.6%) were hepatitis C seropositive; only intravenous drug use and a history of hepatitis A were marginally associated with hepatitis C in this population. No association was found between hepatitis C virus and HIV-1 or sexual behavior variables in this population. These data suggest that hepatitis C is readily transmitted by blood exposure, but is transmitted inefficiently by sexual means."
17625,0.005,1.0000,"In Ontario, Canada, the number of heterosexual men living with HIV has increased over time, yet they remain an understudied population. The study objective was to describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of this population, using data from a multisite clinical cohort of patients receiving HIV care. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of men interviewed between 2010 and 2012 were compared according to their self-identified sexual orientation, followed by multivariable linear and logistic regression to assess the association of sexual orientation with CD4 cell count, viral load, hepatitis C co-infection, self-rated health, and mental health concerns after adjustment for covariates. A total of 552 men identified as heterosexual, 2,023 as gay, and 171 as bisexual. Compared to gay and bisexual men, heterosexual men were more likely to have been born outside of Canada (34.8%); more likely to report African, Caribbean, or Black ethnicity (26.4%) or Indigenous ethnicity (13.6%); and more likely to have low socioeconomic status (59.5% earning less than $20,000 per year), and/or a history of injection drug use (31.7%). Relative to gay men, heterosexual men had 5.19 times the odds of co-infection with hepatitis C virus regardless of injection drug use history (95% confidence interval = 3.87-6.96), and 40% lower odds of rating their health as excellent or good (95% confidence interval = 0.50-0.84). HIV-positive heterosexual men in Ontario constituted a socially marginalized group characterized by a high prevalence of injection drug use history and hepatitis C co-infection."
15415,0.005,1.0000,"Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head is an emerging complication in HIV infected patients. It has been suggested that the increased incidence of AVN in this population may be caused by an increased prevalence of predisposing factors for osteonecrosis, including protease inhibitors, hyperlipidemia, corticosteroid use, alcohol and intravenous drug abuse. The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors for avascular necrosis developing in the femoral head of HIV infected individuals. This study consisted of meta-analysis of the secondary data extracted from current literature. The selected articles allowed two study groups to be drawn up for comparison. Group 1 comprised 324 individuals infected by the HIV virus, who did not present femoral head AVN. Group 2 comprised 32 HIV positive patients, who presented femoral head AVN. The parameters used for analysis were as follows: age, gender, sexual preference, use of intravenous drugs, time of diagnosis, CD4+ cell count, use of antiretroviral agents and duration, serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides. The present study found a statistically significant association between hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, sexual preference and intravenous drug abuse. The authors concluded that femoral head osteonecrosis is associated with hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia) and intravenous drug abuse. This study supports the hypothesis that protease inhibitors play a role in the development of osteonecrosis through a tendency to cause hyperlipidemia."
11162,0.005,1.0000,"A significant association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and B-cell lymphoma has been reported by epidemiological studies, most of them describing a strong relationship between indolent lymphomas and HCV. Furthermore, the curative potential of antiviral therapy on HCV related indolent lymphomas supports a specific role for the virus in lymphomagenesis. These observations are reinforced by numerous laboratory experiments that led to several hypothetical models of B-cell transformation by HCV. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common lymphoma subtype in the western countries, has been associated to HCV infection despite its aggressive nature. This association seems particularly prominent in some geographical areas. Clinical presentation of HCV-associated DLBCL has consistently been reported to differ from the HCV-negative counterpart. Nevertheless, histopathology, tolerance to standard-of-care chemo-immunotherapy (R-CHOP or CHOP-like regimens) and final outcome of HCV-positive DLBCL patients is still matter of debate. Addition of rituximab has been described to enhance viral replication but the probability of severe hepatic complications remains low, with some exceptions (i.e., hepatitis B virus or immune immunodeficiency virus co-infected patients, presence of grade > 2 transaminases elevation, cirrhosis or hepatocarcinoma). HCV viral load in this setting is not necessarily directly associated with liver damage. Overall, treatment of HCV associated DLBCL should be performed in an interdisciplinary approach with hepatologists and hematologists with close monitoring of liver function. Available reports reveal that the final outcome of HCV-positive DLBCL that receive standard immunochemotherapy is not inferior to their HCV-negative counterpart. This review summarizes data on epidemiology, pathogenesis and therapeutic approach on HCV-associated DLBCL. Several issues that are matter of debate like clinical management of patients with transaminase elevation, criteria for discontinuing or starting immuno-chemotherapy, as well as the exact role of monoclonal antibodies will be analyzed.

7953,0.005,1.0000,"We evaluated the plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety of once-daily low-dose boosted saquinavir (SQVr; 1,200 of saquinavir [SQV] with 100 mg of ritonavir) plus two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors in treatment-naive or limited protease inhibitor (PI)-experienced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. A prospective study without entry restrictions on the plasma HIV-RNA (VL) or CD4 cell count was carried out. Plasma and intracellular SQV levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Efficacy was evaluated by an intention-to-treat analysis; treatment failure was defined as virological failure (a VL of >50 copies/ml after 24 weeks or a confirmed rebound to >50 copies/ml) or interruption for any reason. A total of 151 patients were included in the study (106 of them either had never received PI or had no previous virological failure on PIs) and could be characterized as follows: previous C3 stage, 28.9%; injection-drug users, 69.1%; subjects with chronic viral hepatitis, 53%; and subjects with cirrhosis, 10%. The median baseline CD4 level was 184/mul, and the median VL was 4.8 log(10) copies/ml. Median C(max), area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h, and C(min) plasma and intracellular SQV levels were 3,672 and 10,105 ng/ml, 34,283 and 99,535 ng.h/ml, and 359 and 1,062 ng/ml, respectively. The efficacy as determined by intention to treat at 52 weeks was 69.7% (96% in the on-treatment analysis), with similar results regardless of the baseline VL and CD4 counts. Only five patients had virological failure despite adequate C(min) levels, but with a poor adherence (the only variable related to virological failure). Adverse events caused the withdrawal of the treatment in four patients (2.6%). In conclusion, given the pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy, and tolerability of this regimen, once-daily low-dose SQVr may be considered a treatment option in treatment-naive or limited PI-experienced HIV-infected patients, with the additional benefit of being currently the least-expensive PI-based regimen available."
12184,0.005,1.0000,"The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in developed countries has achieved a good control of HIV infection. Despite this, a delayed HIV diagnosis makes it necessary to start antiretroviral treatment in individuals with severe impairment of their immunological function. Very often, this is accompanied by an opportunistic infection that needs to be treated, with a consequent complication of management because of overlapping toxicities and pharmacokinetic interactions with antiretroviral drugs, and a greater pill burden. All this could impair adherence and reconstitution of the immune function with a paradoxical clinical worsening in some patients, especially if the CD4 cell count is below 50 cells/microl. The best antiretroviral regimen and the best timing for starting antiretroviral therapy in treatment-naive patients with advanced infection have not yet been established. Recommendations for the clinical management of advanced HIV disease come from panels of experts in the therapy of opportunistic infections and antiretroviral treatment, and they advise starting combined antiretroviral therapy 2-4 weeks after initiating treatment of the opportunistic infection. Many patients have been successfully treated with a pharmacologically enhanced (boosted) protease inhibitor (mainly lopinavir/ritonavir)-based regimens. The efficacy of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens for the treatment of very immunosuppressed patients has been tested in few clinical trials during the HAART era. Some cohort studies and randomized clinical trials support the use of efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of advanced HIV-1-infected patients; however, recent randomized controlled data suggest, in a moderately advanced HIV population, a better CD4 cell recovery for lopinavir-ritonavir than for efavirenz-treated patients, but a greater virological suppression in the efavirenz arm. Further randomized clinical trials are needed in order to determine whether the efficacy, tolerability and the immunological reconstitution of efavirenz-based therapy can match that achieved with lopinavir/ritonavir or other current boosted protease inhibitor regimens in advanced patients."
2115,0.005,1.0000,"Longitudinal plasma RNA levels were examined in 326 persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), who were participating in 4 clinical trials and 1 observational study. Variations in plasma RNA levels among individuals were analyzed, and correlations were made of replicate and longitudinal measurements, plasma RNA levels, CD4 cell counts, and plasma RNA levels at enrollment. Sample sizes were calculated for detection of differences between treatment groups in mean plasma RNA level at one time point, the average change over time, and the area under the curve. On the basis of study findings, study eligibility criteria should specify a minimum plasma RNA level at least as high as the expected size of the treatment effect, and all longitudinal data should be used when determining the effect of treatment on plasma RNA level. Duplicating plasma RNA levels resulted in a decrease in the required sample size of 14%-41%."
15550,0.005,1.0000,"The neuropathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) is unclear. Candidate gene studies have implicated genetic susceptibility loci within immune-related genes; however, these have not been reliably validated. Here, we employed genome-wide association (GWA) methods to discover novel genetic susceptibility loci associated with HAND, and validate susceptibility loci implicated in prior candidate gene studies. Data from 1,287 participants enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study between 1985 and 2010 were used. Genotyping was conducted with Illumina 1M, 1MDuo, or 550K platform. Linear mixed models determined subject-specific slopes for change over time in processing speed and executive functioning, considering all visits including baseline and the most recent study visit. Covariates modeled as fixed effects included: time since the first visit, depression severity, nadir CD4+ T-cell count, hepatitis C co-infection, substance use, and antiretroviral medication regimen. Prevalence of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) and neurocognitive impairment (NCI) was also examined as neurocognitive phenotypes in a case-control analysis. No genetic susceptibility loci were associated with decline in processing speed or executive functioning among almost 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) directly genotyped or imputed. No association between the SNPs and HAD or NCI were found. Previously reported associations between specific genetic susceptibility loci, HIV-associated NCI, and HAD were not validated. In this first GWAS of HAND, no novel or previously identified genetic susceptibility loci were associated with any of the phenotypes examined. Due to the relatively small sample size, future collaborative efforts that incorporate this dataset may still yield important findings."
4694,0.005,1.0000,"Ibalizumab (formerly TNX-355) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds CD4, the primary receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and inhibits the viral entry process. A phase lb multidose study of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of ibalizumab was conducted with 22 HIV-1-infected patients. Nineteen patients were randomized to receive either 10 mg/kg of body weight weekly (arm A) or a 10-mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks (arm B) intravenously for 9 weeks. Three patients were assigned to receive 25 mg/kg every 2 weeks for five doses (arm C). During the study, the patients remained off other antiretrovirals or continued a stable failing regimen. Treatment with ibalizumab resulted in substantial reductions in HIV-1 RNA levels (0.5 to 1.7 log(10)) in 20 of 22 subjects. In most patients, HIV-1 RNA fell to nadir levels after 1 to 2 weeks of treatment and then returned to baseline despite continued treatment. Baseline viral isolates were susceptible to ibalizumab in vitro, regardless of coreceptor tropism. Emerging resistance to ibalizumab was manifested by reduced maximal percent inhibition in a single-cycle HIV infectivity assay. Resistant isolates remained CD4 dependent and were susceptible to enfuvirtide in vitro. Complete coating of CD4(+) T-cell receptors was correlated with serum ibalizumab concentrations. There was no evidence of CD4(+) T-cell depletion in ibalizumab-treated patients. Ibalizumab was not immunogenic, and no serious drug-related adverse effects occurred. In conclusion, ibalizumab administered either weekly or biweekly was safe and well tolerated and demonstrated antiviral activity. Further studies with ibalizumab in combination with standard antiretroviral treatments are warranted."
1111,0.005,1.0000,"There are conflicting data regarding the influence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection on the immune restoration experienced by HIV-infected patients who receive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In this multicenter, retrospective, longitudinal study, CD4 restoration was assessed according to HCV status in treatment-naive HIV-infected patients within 3 years of HAART. Only patients with persistent HIV suppression were included. Factors predicting CD4 gains were analyzed with multivariate linear regression. Out of 322 patients included 139 had positive HCV-RNA and 183 were only HIV infected. HCV-HIV-coinfected patients were older, more often ex-intravenous drug users (IVDU), and had less advanced HIV infection. Baseline CD4 count [OR -0.21 [95% CI (-0.34)-(-0.04)]; p = 0.01] and male sex [OR -0.19 [95% CI (-191.12)-(-10.87)]; p = 0.03] predicted smaller increments in absolute CD4 counts, and higher baseline CD4% [OR -0.38 [95% CI (-0.39)-(-0.21)]; p < 0.0001] and older age [OR -0.12 [95% CI (-0.23)-(-0.01)]; p = 0.03] predicted smaller gains in CD4% after 3 years of HAART. A history of IVDU was associated with smaller absolute CD4 count increases at 1 year of therapy [OR -0.20 [95% CI (-128.32)-(-16.24)]; p = 0.01]. Use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-only regimens and of zidovudine as part of the NRTI backbone was associated with smaller and greater gains in CD4%, respectively. HCV replication per se does not impair the CD4 restoration in HIV-infected patients successfully treated with antiretroviral therapy. Lower baseline CD4 counts are the strongest predictors of greater CD4 gains over a 3-year period, while a history of IVDU negatively affects CD4 restoration only early after the initiation of HAART."

The study was conducted in 80 centers in North America, Europe, and Australia/New Zealand. A total of 417 patients with histologically documented chronic hepatitis B (histologic activity index [HAI] 9.5-11.0) received famciclovir (500 mg 3 times daily or 1.5 g once daily) or placebo. Famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily significantly reduced HBV DNA and median HAI scores versus placebo. By week 8, median HBV DNA decreased from 1,645 to 283 MEq/mL (famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily) and from 1,147 to 304 MEq/mL (famciclovir 1.5 g once daily), while increasing for placebo (1,617 to 1,685 MEq/mL). Median change in HBV DNA at the end of therapy was -76% (famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily; P <.01) and -60% (famciclovir 1.5 g once daily; P =.25) versus -37% for placebo. Median change in HAI was -1.5 points (famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily; P =.02) and -1.0 point (famciclovir 1.5 g once daily; P =.35) and zero for placebo. Fifty percent of patients receiving famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily (P =.07) and 43% receiving 1.5 g once daily (P =.41) experienced >/=2 points improvement in HAI versus 37% for placebo. Nine percent of patients treated with famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily underwent anti-HBeAg seroconversion with undetectable HBV DNA at end of follow-up versus 3% in the placebo group (P =.05). Famciclovir was well tolerated; the incidence of post-treatment alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations was comparable with placebo. In conclusion, famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily gave modest suppression of viral replication, but translated into significant histologic improvement in median HAI score at 1 year."
13753,0.005,1.0000,"Globally, about 50% of liver cancer originates as a result of long term infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and some genotypes and mutations have been associated with an increased severity of infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic diversity of HBV in patients from Venezuela, with chronic infection, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to compare the occurrence of mutations in all patient groups. Samples from patients with different pathologies of the liver, associated with HBV infection, were collected. The HBV S region was analyzed for genotype determination and, when available, the whole genome sequence was examined for mutations analysis. Genotype F was the most common genotype (87%). While the HBV subgenotype F3 was the most frequent genotype in the whole group of samples (44%), the subgenotype F2 predominated in HCC patients (56%). Mutations were more common in HCC and cirrhosis cases (p=0.01). The A1762T mutation was significantly associated with the advanced stage of liver disease (p=0.008). Additionally, mutations were more common in early stages of liver disease in HBV subgenotype F2-infected patients, and a significant association between this subgenotype and the emergence of T 1753C, A1762T, A1762T/G1764A (p=0.04) and C1773T (p=0.001) mutations in chronic patients was found, when compared to the HBV subgenotype F3. By comparing F2 with all other HBV subgenotypes, a positive association for the three basal core promoter (BCP) mutants (A1762T, A1762T/G1764A p=0.01, G1764A p=0.04) was found. These results suggest that the HBV subgenotype F2 might be associated to more severe forms of liver disease in comparison with the HBV subgenotype F3."

We used Medicare claims (2006-2009) linked to the Area Health Resource Files. ALD was measured over the period of 6 months before to 3 months after diagnosis. Using weighted multivariate modified Poisson regression to address generalizability of findings to all Medicare patients, we modeled the association between contextual characteristics and presence of ALD at HCV diagnosis. We identified 1,746, 3,351, and 592 patients with ALD prevalence of 28.0%, 23.0%, and 15.0% for birth cohorts 1, 2, and 3.

12804,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is highly prevalent among chronic dialysis patients (10% to 40%) and is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. However, there are no studies estimating the risk for death among dialysis patients infected with HCV compared with those not infected. We conducted a prospective cohort study to estimate the risk for death among chronic dialysis patients infected with HCV compared with those not infected. In 1992, 200 patients (91%) who had been undergoing dialysis therapy for at least 6 months consented to be screened for HCV infection by enzyme immunoblot assay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Information about potential confounders and potential risk factors for death and HCV infection was obtained from the dialysis center database. Patient outcomes collected included death, transplantation, and loss to follow-up. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the odds of death among dialysis patients who were positive for the HCV antibody and HCV RNA compared with negative patients. Forty-four patients (22%) were HCV antibody positive. Thirty-four patients (17%) were HCV RNA positive. Patients in the HCV RNA-positive group were more likely to be younger (51.8+/-12.6 v 57.2+/-17.3 years of age), men (77% v 54%), and black (65% v 37%). None of the home hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis patients were HCV RNA positive, whereas one of the home hemodialysis and one of the peritoneal dialysis patients were HCV antibody positive. Two patients became infected with HCV during the follow-up period. Patients who were HCV RNA positive and those who were HCV antibody positive were at increased risk for death compared with patients who were negative (adjusted relative risk [aRR]=1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 3.14; P=0.045; and aRR=1.97; 95% CI, 1.16 to 3.33; P=0.012, respectively), after adjusting for time on dialysis, race, transplantation, and age. We conclude that HCV infection increased the risk for death during the study period compared with those not infected. Further studies should assess the measures used to prevent and treat HCV infection."
6624,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is considered a major health problem recognized globally. HCV is a major cause of chronic liver disease that may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of multiple (mixed) HCV genotypes in Saudi patients recently diagnosed with HCV infection and their association with various clinical risk factors. We examined a total of 1,292 newly diagnosed HCV-positive cases between January 2006 and July 2009 at the Molecular Pathology Laboratory, King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh. The clinical and laboratory data of the study patients were collected. The HCV-RNA viral load and its genotyping were carried out with RT-PCR technology to assist in the follow-up and management of HCV-infected patients undergoing antiviral therapy. Twenty-two patients (1.7%) were found to have mixed HCV genotypes; of them, mixed genotypes associated with genotype-4 were seen in 19 patients (86%), mixed genotypes associated with genotype-1 were found in 68.4%, with genotype-3 in 26.3% and with genotype-2 in 5.3%. Additionally, mixed genotypes associated with genotype-1 were seen in three cases (13.6%); they were associated with genotype-2 in two (66.7%) and with genotype-5 in one patient (33.3%). In conclusion, the prevalence rate of mixed HCV genotypes in the cohort of the newly infected Saudi patients was 1.7%, with genotype-4 being the most frequent genotype encountered."

Cox proportional-hazards model was used to examine risk factors related to HIV seroconversion of negative partners. Finally, 125 HIV seroconversion occurred over 4963.5 person-years, resulting in an overall HIV incidence of 2.52/100 person-years. HIV-positive partners with the last CD4 counts of 350 cells/ul or more were significantly protected against HIV seroconversion compared with those CD4 counts of less than 200 cells/ul (aHR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.27-0.81, P < 0.01). Men with HIV-positive wives (aHR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.27-3.02, P < 0.01), HIV-positive partners who did not receive ART before their HIV-negative partners' seroconversion (aHR: 2.22, 95% CI, 1.41-3.51, P < 0.01) and patients reported intermittent condom use (aHR: 7.60, 95% CI, 4.37-13.21, P < 0.01) were associated with increased risk of HIV seroconversion.

We developed the CSF HIV risk score through prediction modeling to estimate the risk of detectable CSF HIV RNA (threshold >50 copies/mL) to help identify persons who might benefit most from CSF monitoring. We used baseline data from 1,053 participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy who were enrolled in the 6-center, US-based CNS HIV Antiretroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) prospective cohort in 2004-2007. Plasma HIV RNA, CNS penetration effectiveness, duration of combination antiretroviral therapy, medication adherence, race, and depression status were retained correlates of CSF HIV RNA, displaying good discrimination (C statistic = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.87, 0.93) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow P = 0.85). The CSF HIV risk score ranges from 0 to 42 points, with a mean of 15.4 (standard deviation, 7.3) points. At risk scores greater than 25, the probability of detecting CSF HIV RNA was at least 42.9% (95% CI: 36.6, 49.6). For each 1-point increase, the odds of detecting CSF HIV RNA increased by 26% (odds ratio = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.21, 1.31; P < 0.01). The risk score correlates with detection of CSF HIV RNA. It represents an advance in HIV management and monitoring of CNS effects, providing a potentially useful tool for clinicians. "

We determined if detectable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) at threshold ≥50 copies/ml is associated with increased risk of depression. The CNS HIV Anti-Retroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) cohort is a six-center US-based prospective cohort with bi-annual follow-up of 674 participants. We fit linear mixed models (N = 233) and discrete-time survival models (N = 154; 832 observations) to evaluate trajectories of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) II scores and the incidence of new-onset moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms (BDI ≥ 17) among participants on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), who were free of depression at study entry and received a minimum of three CSF examinations over 2496 person-months follow-up. Detectable CSF HIV RNA (threshold ≥50 copies/ml) at any visit was associated with a 4.7-fold increase in new-onset depression at subsequent visits adjusted for plasma HIV RNA and treatment adherence; hazard ratio (HR) = 4.76, (95 % CI 1.58-14.3); P = 0.006. Depression (BDI) scores were 2.53 points higher (95 % CI 0.47-4.60; P = 0.02) over 6 months if CSF HIV RNA was detectable at a prior study visit in fully adjusted models including age, sex, race, education, plasma HIV RNA, duration and adherence of CART, and lifetime depression diagnosis by Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) criteria.

13957,0.005,1.0000,"In current practice, human immunodeficiency virus-infected (HIV(+) ) candidates with CD4 >200 cells/mm(3) are eligible for kidney transplantation; however, the optimal pretransplant CD4 count above this threshold remains to be defined. We evaluated clinical outcomes in patients with baseline CD4 >350 and <350 cells/mm(3) among 38 anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)-treated HIV-negative to HIV(+) kidney transplants performed at our center between 2006 and 2013. Median follow-up was 2.6 years. Rates of acute rejection and patient and graft survival were not different between groups. Occurrence of severe CD4 lymphopenia (<200 cells/mm(3) ), however, was more common among patients with a baseline CD4 count 200-349 cells/mm(3) compared with those transplanted at higher counts (75% vs. 30% at 4 weeks [p = 0.04] and 71% vs. 5% at 52 weeks [p = 0.001], respectively, after transplant).

17064,0.005,1.0000,"Lopinavir is a novel protease inhibitor (PI) developed from ritonavir. Coadministration with low-dose ritonavir significantly improves the pharmacokinetic properties and hence the activity of lopinavir against HIV-1 protease. Coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir was developed for ease of administration and to ensure both drugs are taken together, as part of combination therapy with other antiretroviral agents. Coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimens provide adequate and durable suppression of viral load and sustained improvements in CD4+ cell counts, as demonstrated in randomised trials in antiretroviral therapy-naive and -experienced adults and children. To date, development of primary resistance to lopinavir/ritonavir has not been observed in 470 antiretroviral therapy-naive patients treated for >48 weeks. The lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimen was more effective than nelfinavir in antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV-1-infected patients in a phase III trial. The coformulation is also effective as 'salvage' therapy, as shown by low cross-resistance rates in patients who failed to respond to treatment with other PIs in phase II trials. Coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir was well tolerated in both antiretroviral therapy-naive and -experienced HIV-1-infected adults and children with low rates of study drug-related treatment discontinuations. The most common adverse event in adults associated with lopinavir/ritonavir was diarrhoea, followed by other gastrointestinal disturbances, asthenia, headache and skin rash. The incidence of moderate-to-severe adverse events in children was low, skin rash being the most common. Changes in body fat composition occurred with equal frequency in lopinavir/ritonavir- and nelfinavir-treated naive patients, through week 60 in a phase III study. Although laboratory abnormalities occurred with similar frequency in both treatment groups, triglycerides grade 3/4 elevations were significantly more frequent with lopinavir/ritonavir. Total cholesterol and triglycerides grade 3/4 elevations appear to occur more frequently in PI-experienced than in PI-naive lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients. A number of clinically important drug interactions have been reported with lopinavir/ritonavir necessitating dosage adjustments of lopinavir/ritonavir and/or the interacting drugs, and several other drugs are contraindicated in patients receiving the coformulation."
15906,0.005,1.0000,"Disclosure of HIV status to family, friends, and a stable partner may be linked to improved health outcomes for people living with HIV. This study assessed whether non-disclosure is associated with psychological symptoms, non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and viral load (VL) non-suppression. A total of 3258 HIV-diagnosed individuals in the UK completed the confidential ASTRA study questionnaire (2011-2012). Participants reported whether they told anyone they had HIV; to which confidant(s) (friends, family, work colleagues, stable partner) and to what extent (none, some, most/all). The prevalence and factors associated with non-disclosure were assessed. Associations between non-disclosure and the following factors were established using modified Poisson regression with adjustment for socio-demographic factors (gender, age group, ethnicity), HIV-related factors (time since HIV diagnosis, ART status), and clinic: low social support (score ≤ 12 on modified Duke-UNC FSSQ); depression and anxiety symptoms (≥10 on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 respectively); self-reported ART non-adherence in past 2 weeks/3 months; VL non-suppression (clinic-recorded VL > 50 copies/mL among those who started ART ≥ 6 months ago). Among 3233 participants with disclosure data, the prevalence of non-disclosure to anyone was 16.6 % (n/N = 61/367) among heterosexual men, 15.7 % (98/626) among women, and 5.0 % (113/2240) among MSM. MSM were more likely to disclose to some/all friends compared to family (85.8 vs. 59.9 %) while heterosexuals were less likely to disclose to friends than family (44.1 vs. 61.1 % for men, 57.5 vs. 67.1 % for women). Among 1,631 participants with a stable partner, non-disclosure to a stable partner was 4.9 % for MSM, 10.9 % for heterosexual men, and 13.0 % for women. In adjusted analyses, older age (≥60 years), non-white ethnicity, more recent HIV diagnosis, and not having a stable partner were significantly associated with overall non-disclosure for MSM and heterosexual individuals. The prevalence of low social support was 14.4 %, of depression and anxiety symptoms 27.1 and 22.0 %, respectively, of ART non-adherence 31.8 %, and of viral load non-suppression on ART 9.8 %. There was no evidence that non-disclosure overall (versus disclosure to anyone) was associated with low social support, depression or anxiety symptoms, ART non-adherence or VL non-suppression among MSM or heterosexual individuals. However, compared to MSM who disclosed to 'none' or 'some' friends and family, MSM who disclosed to 'most or all' of their friends and family were more likely to have symptoms of depression (adjusted PR = 1.4, 95 % CI 1.2-1.7), anxiety (1.3, 1.1-1.6), and to report ART non-adherence (1.3, 1.1-1.5). In this large multicentre study of people living with HIV in the UK, non-disclosure was overall low, but higher for heterosexual individuals compared to MSM. Non-disclosure was not associated with higher prevalence of adverse health measures."
6028,0.005,1.0000,"Diarrhea is a common symptom that many HIV patients experience either as a consequence of HIV infection or of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A multicenter, prospective observational study was conducted in 11 AIDS clinics in Italy to determine the effect of diarrhea on health-related quality of life among patients receiving HAART. The study enrolled 100 consecutive HIV positive patients who had diarrhea while on HAART. For each enrolled patient a control patient with matching disease stage who did not have diarrhea was identified using existing data from another prospective observational study conducted in 34 AIDS clinics (including the 11 in current study). Quality of life was measured by MOS-HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV). Paired t-test and multiple regression analysis were used to compare the quality of life among patients with and without diarrhea. Mean patient age was 40 +/- 7 years; 69% were male. Mean CD4 cell count was 342 +/- 239 cells/mm3; 59% had AIDS. Of the cases, 49 patients had severe diarrhea (> 5 bowel movements or > 3 watery per day) and 46 patients had moderate diarrhea (3-5 bowel movements). Compared to matched control patients, cases experiencing diarrhea while on HAART had significantly lower MOS-HIV scores in all domains. The significant adverse effect of diarrhea on quality of life should be considered when choosing the appropriate antiretroviral drugs regimen."
9696,0.005,1.0000,"Men with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are often hypogonadal and develop several HIV-associated non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (HANA) conditions that impair overall health status. No studies explored the relationship between health status and serum testosterone (T) in HIV-infected men. This study aims to investigate the association between total serum T and HANA, multimorbidity, and frailty in a large cohort of 1359 HIV-infected men and to explore the relationship between patients' overall health status and serum T. Among biochemical and hormonal measurement performed the main are serum total T, free triiodothyronine (fT3), and luteinizing hormone. Other outcome measurements include anthropometry, assessment of comorbidities and disabilities, overall health status defined as the number of HANA and by the 38-item multimorbidity frailty index, anthropometry, and bone mineral density. The cumulative relative risk of comorbidities is increased in HIV-infected men with hypogonadism (p < 0.001) and hypogonadism is associated with several comorbidities. The prevalence of hypogonadism increases progressively with the increase of the number of comorbidities. Frailty index is inversely related to serum total T (age-adjusted r = 0.298, r(2) = 0.089, p < 0.0001). Serum fT3 levels are significantly lower in hypogonadal than eugonadal men (p = 0.022). This suggests that low serum T could be considered a sensitive marker of frailty and poor health status and that the latter might induce hypogonadism. The more HIV-infected men are frail the more they are hypogonadal. This suggests that hypogonadism might be a naturally occurring condition in unhealthy HIV-infected men and raises concern about the safety of T treatment. In conclusion, low serum T is associated with multimorbidity, HANA, and frailty in HIV-infected men and this association seems to be bidirectional. Given the wide attitude to offer T treatment to HIV-infected men, caution is needed when prescribing T to HIV-infected male patients, especially if the patient is unhealthy or frail."

However, little is known of the association of these two disorders in the HIV population. Our objective was to investigate the association between a marker of atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcium [CAC]) and low bone mineral density (BMD) in a cross-sectional cohort of HIV-infected patients. The study was conducted at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy. A total of 636 consecutive middle-aged, HIV-infected subjects were recruited between January 2006 and December 2010. All patients underwent CAC and BMD assessment. Patients were categorized according to a CAC score <100 or >100 units based on previous literature that identified this cut-point as a marker of increased risk. Low femoral and lumbar spine BMD was defined as <25th percentile value for the study cohort. Logistic regression and bootstrap analysis were used to assess the independent association between CAC and BMD. The main outcome measure was a CAC score >100. Patients with CAC > 100 were older and more likely to be men, diabetic, and overweight. Patients with CAC < 100 had better renal function and a lower cardiovascular risk profile. After adjusting for age, sex, traditional and HIV-specific risk factors, vitamin D level, and PTH level, there was a significant association between CAC > 100 and low BMD for the femur (OR = 2.33, 95 % CI 1.09-4.99; p = 0.02) but not for the spine. Bootstrap analyses confirmed these findings. In summary, CAC was independently associated with low femoral BMD in HIV-infected patients. Future studies should test whether therapies that attenuate cardiovascular risk in HIV favorably impact bone health."
6258,0.005,1.0000,"In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that people who contracted HIV from ""blameless"" routes (e.g., blood transfusion, sex with stable partners) are less stigmatized compared to people who contracted HIV from ""blamable"" routes (e.g., injection drug use, sex with sex workers). A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2,987 participants in Guangxi province, China, between 2012 and 2013. We employed both explanatory and predictive modeling strategy by using multivariate linear regression models. In the explanatory models, we assessed the association between routes of infection and three types of stigma (perceived, internalized, and enacted). From identified routes of infection that significantly contributed to higher stigma, we employed predictive modeling to explore predictors for the specific type of stigma. Multiple-imputation was employed for sensitivity analyses. Of the total sample, 63% were male and the average age was 42.9 years (ranged between 18 and 88). Multivariate regression models revealed that contraction from commercial sex increased the perceived (β = 0.46, 95%CI = 0.02, 0.90) and internalized stigma (β = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.09, 1.10), while injecting drug use increased the perceived (β = 0.65, 95%CI = 0.07, 1.22) and enacted stigma (β = 0.09, 95%CI = 0.02, 0.16) after controlling for confounders. Among PLWHA who were infected via commercial sex partners, social support was negatively associated with perceived (β = -0.47, 95%CI = -0.79, -0.14) and internalized stigma (β = -0.80, 95%CI = -1.24, -0.35). Among PLWHA who were infected via injecting drugs, no adherence to antiretroviral treatment (β = 0.41, 95%CI = 0.01, 0.82) was positively associated with perceived stigma, and disclosure of serostatus to others was negatively associated with enacted stigma (β = -0.20, 95%CI = -0.34, -0.05). Knowledge of the association between routes of infection and stigma can guide health professionals and policy makers to develop tailored intervention strategies to mitigate the effects of stigma and enhance HIV care utilization among PLWHA in China.

10376,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is estimated to have infected more than a million people in the United States and millions more in other countries. Even though there is no vaccine or effective treatment, HIV infection can be prevented through behavioral change. As the lead Public Health Service Agency for disease prevention, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has designed and implemented information and education activities with the ultimate goal of preventing HIV infection and AIDS in the United States. The target populations include the general public, school- and college-aged populations, persons infected or at increased risk of infection, minorities, and health workers. Because AIDS will be with us for a long time, CDC views educating the public as a long-term undertaking. The agency has initiated an intensive continuing national public information campaign, an informational brochure to be distributed to every U.S. household, a national AIDS information toll-free hotline, and a clearinghouse system that will maintain a comprehensive inventory of AIDS information resources and services. CDC also supports public information and education efforts by State and local health agencies. To reach school- and college-age youth, CDC, in consultation with governmental and national private sector organizations, developed guidelines for effective school health education to assist school health personnel in determining the scope and content of AIDS education. CDC also works with State and local education agencies to help carry out and evaluate educational efforts to prevent the spread of HIV among school- and college-age youth. The populations with the highest priority for AIDS information and education efforts are those who are at increased risk of acquiring or transmitting the AIDS virus because they use illicit intravenous drugs and share needles, engage in anal intercourse, have many sexual partners, practice prostitution, or engage in sex with those who practice these behaviors. Another high-priority population, because they can infect their offspring,is reproductive age women engaging in high-risk behavior and women infected with HIV who become pregnant. CDC programs targeted to these groups include community health education and risk reduction interventions, counseling and testing for HIV infection, AIDS community demonstration projects, perinatal AIDS prevention projects,and programs focused on preventing AIDS in minority populations. CDC is developing a variety of educational approaches for health workers in clinical settings because they are an important channel for providing accurate AIDS information, helping to assess risk, and counseling to actively reduce risk for the patient, sex partners of the patient, friends, and family members of the patient. CDC has conducted research and provided information and training on the use of HIV laboratory tests. CDC has also developed numerous scientific and technical guidelines and recommendations in consultation with practitioners, public health officials, and others and disseminated these through the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. In addition,CDC has provided information about the risk of HIV transmission in the workplace and about methods of prevention. CDC will continue to evaluate these activities and support research in education and related interventions that may be necessary to prevent infection by the HIV virus. By providing educational support for behavior changes that decrease HIV transmission, we can contribute to AIDS prevention in the 1990s."
9689,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the HIV seroconversion rate associated with different types of occupational exposures in health care workers. A longitudinal study was conducted from January 1986 to October 1992 in a teaching hospital in Spain, where HIV infection is prevalent among patients. Each health care worker was asked to complete a questionnaire regarding age, sex, staff category, lace of exposure, other exposures, type of exposure, body fluid, infected material and HIV status of source patient. These health care workers were then followed up at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months with repeated test for HIV antibody. Four hundred twenty three reports of occupational exposure were analysed. Nursing was the profession with more exposures (42.8%). Ninety five percent of total exposures were percutaneous, 4% mucous membrane contacts and 1% skin contacts, 88.3% were described as blood contact and 71.8% had resulted from needlestick and suture needles. Exposures from HIV-positive patients comprised 23.2% of occupational exposures. There was a significant difference in the length of follow-up in physicians (p = 0.00009) and nurses (p = 0.00001), when we compared HIV-positive patients with patients in whom the HIV status was unknown or negative. The HIV seroconversion rate was 0.00%. We consider that the risk of acquiring HIV infection via contact with a patient is low, but not zero. Well documented cases of seroconversion have been published.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
4457,0.005,1.0000,"This understood without starting paper describes general histopathological features of deep-seated mycoses in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) detailed histological examination on cryptococcal lesions with a consideration of morphological modification caused by treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In a histopathological review of 164 patients with total human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the microscopical appearance of esophageal candidiasis which was common in those with single organ involvement revealed necrotic debris containing proliferating hyphae at the site of mucosal erosions without fungal invasion of underlying tissue. The incidence of oral and esophageal candidiasis was followed by that of pulmonary aspergillosis and Candida pneumonia. Nineteen patients including one treated with HAART had generalized cryptococcosis, representing the most common generalized fungal disease. The essential histologic features of the disease were yeast cell proliferation with a histiocytic response, but only minor lymphocytic and neutrophilic components. This was different from those induced by both Candida and Aspergillus infections. Three histologic patterns were recognized in the pulmonary cryptococcal lesions, two of which could be graded with respect to the degree and type of inflammatory reaction. The first was a mild one consisting of small scattered foci of intra-alveolar cryptococcal proliferation with a histiocytic response. The second pattern involved massive cryptococcal infection, which might have been simply more extensive than that in the former. Capillary involvement of alveolar septa was an important common finding in the eighteen patients who had not been treated with HAART. The absence of T cells and decreasing function of antigen-presenting activity in histiocytes were confirmed by immunohistological examination. These findings suggest that the lungs of AIDS patients without HAART offer little resistance to bloodstream dissemination by Cryptococci. The third pattern demonstrated in the patient treated with HAART was characterized by the presence of CD4+ cells, greater response of histiocytes and multinucleated giant cell formation, and lack of massive capillary involvement."
1385,0.005,1.0000,"We have examined the relation of cell surface marker phenotype to the anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) function of CD8+ cells from individuals at various clinical stages of HIV infection. Multiparametric flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that the most significant changes in cell surface phenotype was found within the CD8+ cell subset expressing HLA-DR and CD28. These changes in the levels of CD28 and HLA-DR expression on CD8+ cells were found to be related to antiviral activity and have clinical relevance based on three pieces of evidence: (1) strong CD8+ cell antiviral responses were associated in infected individuals with high levels of HLA-DR+ and CD28+ subsets; (2) CD8+ cell anti-HIV activity in vitro resides predominantly in the separated CD8+ cell subsets that express HLA-DR or CD28; and (3) in longitudinal studies, CD8+ cell anti-HIV activity decreased as an individual progressed from a healthy state to an AIDS condition. Taken together, the data suggest that the CD8+ cell subset identified phenotypically as a CD8+ CD28+ HLA-DR+ cell is responsible for natural anti-HIV activity. Longitudinal studies should determine if alterations in this subset can be used as a prognostic indicator for disease progression."
1401,0.005,1.0000,"Most infants with pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and infections with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are infected perinatally by their mothers. To determine the proportion of exposed infants who are infected, we conducted a hospital-based prospective study in HIV-1-infected women whose infants were delivered at a single metropolitan hospital in Miami, Fla. A population of uninfected women and their infants was also enrolled and followed longitudinally for 2 years to assess laboratory and clinical measurements. The median follow-up is now 18 months for 82 infants born to HIV-1-infected mothers. The proportion of infected infants in this group is 0.30 (25/82). None of the infants born to 110 HIV-1-seronegative mothers were seropositive. Infected infants were easily distinguished from noninfected infants by virus isolation. No single immunologic or hematologic measure was predictive of infection for all infants at risk for HIV-1 infection who were 6 months of age or younger. As a group, however, infected infants could be distinguished from uninfected index infants by a number of immunologic measures by 6 months of age; the absolute number of CD4+ lymphocytes and the CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio were the variables most predictive of infection. As in retrospective studies, clinical disease developed in 80% of infected infants within the first 24 months of life. This study provides documentation of HIV-1 perinatal transmission risk and early correlates of infection in young infants from a single hospital."
3154,0.005,1.0000,"Adefovir dipivoxil was recently approved for the treatment of wild-type and lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, a congender of adefovir that is used in the treatment of HIV infected patients, has recently been shown to also be effective in patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV infection. We therefore compared the two substances in a study of 53 patients defined by high HBV DNA (>6 log10 copies/mL) levels and genotypic evidence of lamivudine resistance. Thirty-five patients received tenofovir for 72 to 130 weeks, and 18 received adefovir for 60 to 80 weeks. Changes in HBV DNA levels were followed for the complete period of 48 weeks. Early viral kinetics were compared on matched subgroups of 5 patients each. Individually, all tenofovir-treated patients showed a strong and early suppression of HBV DNA within a few weeks whether they were coinfected with HIV or were without comorbidity. In contrast, considerable individual variations in HBV DNA decline were observed in the adefovir group. Thus at week 48, only 44% of these patients had HBV DNA levels below 10(5) copies/mL in contrast to 100% of the tenofovir-treated patients (P = .001). No severe side effects were noticed in either group. No evidence of phenotypic viral resistance could be demonstrated in the tenofovir-treated patients in the long term (up to 130 weeks). In conclusion, tenofovir may become an effective alternative for the treatment of patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV infection."
6647,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can evade immunity shortly after transmission to a new host but the clinical significance of this early viral adaptation in HIV infection is not clear. We present an analysis of sequence variation from a longitudinal cohort study of HIV adaptation in 189 acute seroconverters followed for up to 3 years. We measured the rates of variation within well-defined epitopes to determine associations with the HLA-linked hazard of disease progression. We found early reversion across both the gag and pol genes, with a 10-fold faster rate of escape in gag (2.2 versus 0.27 forward mutations/1,000 amino acid sites). For most epitopes (23/34), variation in the HLA-matched and HLA-unmatched controls was similar. For a minority of epitopes (8/34, and generally associated with HLA class I alleles that confer clinical benefit), new variants appeared early and consistently over the first 3 years of infection. Reversion occurred early at a rate which was HLA-dependent and correlated with the HLA class 1-associated relative hazard of disease progression and death (P = 0.0008), reinforcing the association between strong cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses, viral fitness, and disease status. These data provide a comprehensive overview of viral adaptation in the first 3 years of infection. Our findings of HLA-dependent reversion suggest that costs are borne by some escape variants which may benefit the host, a finding contrary to a simple immune evasion paradigm. These epitopes, which are both strongly and frequently recognized, and for which escape involves a high cost to the virus, have the potential to optimize vaccine design."
18644,0.005,1.0000,"A cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleoprotein residues 88-96 that are the minimal and optimal epitope for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B44-restricted CTLs was assessed in 27 HLA B44-positive patients with chronic HCV infection. Serum HCV RNA concentration and the amino acid sequence of the residues 81-100 were also determined. Three patients were infected with HCV with uncommon amino acid substitutions within the epitope. One was infected with HCV with an amino acid substitution in the flanking residues of the epitope. To stimulate CTLs in the peripheral blood, 9-mer peptides that corresponded to the residues 88-96 of the individual patients were synthesized and used. Seven of the 27 patients demonstrated a CTL response to the residues 88-96 with specific cytotoxic activities higher than 20%. The CTL activities were significantly higher in patients with a low titer of serum HCV RNA than in those with a high titer of serum HCV RNA (P = .0006). Some of the patients that demonstrated a CTL response to the residues 88-96 also demonstrated a CTL response to a newly identified HLA B44-restricted CTL epitope or a known HLA A11-restricted CTL epitope or both. No apparent association was observed between the CTL response and the stage of disease, or between the CTL response and the grade of necroinflammatory activity. The results suggest that the HLA B44-restricted CTLs together with other HCV-specific CTLs may inhibit the outgrowth of HCV and that high-titer infection with HCV may suppress the CTL responses."
576,0.005,1.0000,"A recently available assay to quantify serum viral load in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been used to evaluate the effects of anti-viral therapies. However, variability in HCV RNA levels in untreated patients with HCV infection has not yet been established. We therefore prospectively measured the biological fluctuations of HCV RNA in sera from untreated patients with chronic HCV infection. Sera were collected from seven patients at 8 am and 4 pm on the same day to assess the effect of diurnal variation, daily for 5 days in a further 10 patients, biweekly for 6 weeks in nine patients and monthly for 3 months in 11 patients. All patients had biopsy-proven chronic liver disease with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values and had not received anti-viral treatment. HCV RNA was measured blinded, in duplicate, using the quantitative branched (bDNA) amplification assay (Quantiplex HCV RNA, Chiron Co. Emeryville, CA) 36 of the 37 patients studied had measurable HCV RNA throughout the study. There was no significant correlation between HCV RNA levels and ALT values or histological activity. HCV RNA levels did not appear to vary significantly within any of the groups studied and there did not appear to be a change associated with diurnal variation. All individual patients demonstrated less than a threefold fluctuation in HCV RNA throughout the study period. Hence HCV RNA levels remain relatively stable in untreated individuals with chronic HCV infection. Changes of a magnitude of threefold (0.5 log) or greater in HCV RNA levels were not observed in untreated patients."
17038,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals who remain asymptomatic despite prolonged infection present a unique opportunity to understand virologic and immunologic factors involved in the pathogenesis of AIDS. We have previously identified a group of long-term survivors (LTS) who are clinically healthy and immunologically normal despite 13 to 15 years of HIV-1 infection. In this study, we examined the 5' long terminal repeat (5' LTR) sequences in eight of these LTS. A total of 29 nucleotide sequences were obtained from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Analysis of these sequences revealed no gross deletions within the 5' LTR. Seven of the eight subjects shared nearly identical consensus sequences in the binding sites for NF-kappaB, Sp1, and the viral trans-activator Tat. In multiple samples from one individual (Pt 5), however, G-to-A hypermutations were found throughout the entire region, suggesting a genetically defective 5' LTR. The effects of the observed genetic variations on LTR transcription were studied by transient transfection of an LTR-driven luciferase reporter gene and by infection with a full-length recombinant HIV-1 containing a luciferase reporter (HIVHXBLTRluc). A wide range of basal and Tat-induced transcriptional activities was found among the 5' LTR from seven of the eight LTS in both transfected 293 cells and donor PBMC, suggesting a functionally intact 5' LTR in these individuals. It is therefore unlikely that defects in the 5' LTR are the underlying explanation for the benign clinical course associated with these seven individuals. However, functional abnormalities were found in the LTR from Pt 5 in directing both heterologous and viral gene expression, providing a possible genetic explanation for the low viral load and prolonged asymptomatic state of this individual. Last, a similar overall degree of genetic diversity was found among viruses from the LTS compared to those from patients with AIDS, reinforcing the notion that a strong correlation between the degree of genetic diversity and the rate of disease progression is unlikely."

In addition, oral lesions are included in staging systems for HIV disease progression and as entry criteria or endpoints in clinical trials of antiretroviral drugs. Recognition and management of these oral conditions is important for the health and quality of life of the individual with HIV/AIDS. In keeping with this, the U.S. Department of Health Services Clinical Practice Guideline for Evaluation and Management of Early HIV Infection includes recommendations that an oral examination, emphasizing oral mucosal surfaces, be conducted by the primary care provider at each visit, a dental examination by a dentist should be done at least two times a year, and patients should be informed of the importance of oral care and educated about common HIV-related oral lesions and associated symptoms."

Using 200 mg/kg, mean half-life and volume of distribution (Vd) in women were 15 days and 72 mL/kg, respectively, after one and 32 days and 154 mL/kg after three monthly infusions, with stable 4 mL/kg/day clearance. Transplacental passage occurred. Newborn single-dose half-life, Vd, and clearance were 30 days, 143 mL/kg, and 4 mL/kg/day, respectively. HIVIG rapidly cleared maternal serum immune complex-dissociated p24 antigen, and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were stable. Mild to moderate adverse clinical effects occurred in 2 of 103 maternal and 2 of 25 infant infusions. No adverse hematologic, blood chemistry, or immunologic effects were seen.

Quantification revealed RNA in 85.7% and p24 antigen in 87.4% of 230 samples from 25 infected children. Concentrations of these indices in individual samples correlated (P<.0001). Introduction or modification of antiretroviral treatment showed concordant responses of RNA and p24 antigen in 39 (90.7%) of 43 instances. The treatment-induced changes in concentrations of RNA were higher than those of p24 antigen in 11 instances. In 1 instance, however, the concentration change of p24 antigen was greater than that of RNA (P=. 002). Variation of RNA concentrations was more marked than that of p24 antigen (P=.002).

11119,0.005,1.0000,"Development of HCV infection is typically followed by chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in most patients, while spontaneous HCV viral clearance (SVC) occurs in only a minority of subjects. Compared with the widespread application of HCV RNA testing by quantitative RT-PCR technique, HCV core antigen detection may be an alternative indicator in the diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infections and in monitoring the status of infectious individuals. However, the correlation and differences between these two indicators in HCV infection need more investigation, especially in patients coinfected by HIV-1. In this study, a total of 354 anti-HCV and/or anti-HIV serum positive residents from a village of central China were enrolled. Besides HCV-related hepatopathic variables including clinical status, ALT, AST, anti-HCV Abs, as well as the altered CD4+/CD8+ T cell counts, HCV core antigen and HCV viral load were also measured. The concentration of serum HCV core antigen was highly correlated with level of HCV RNA in CHC patients with or without HIV-1 coinfection. Of note, HCV core antigen concentration was negatively correlated with CD4+ T cell count, while no correlation was found between HCV RNA level and CD4+ T cell count. Our findings suggested that quantitative detection of plasma HCV core antigen may be an alternative indicator of HCV RNA qPCR assay when evaluating the association between HCV replication and host immune status in HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients."
4172,0.005,1.0000,"A semiquantitative PCR technique for detecting human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA in plasma was compared with quantitative viral culture and p24 antigen detection in plasma. Ninety-three samples from 20 symptomatic, 10 asymptomatic, and 10 seronegative individuals were tested. For most of the seropositive patients, consecutives samples were examined. Viral RNA was extracted from plasma by the method described by Boom et al. (R. Boom, C.J. A. Sol, M. M. M. Salimans, C.L. Jansen, P. M. E. Wertheim-van Dillen, and J. van der Noordaa, J. Clin. Microbiol. 28:495-503, 1990). The RNA PCR was the most sensitive method (100 and 74% sensitivity for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, respectively) and produced less divergent results with the consecutive samples from individual patients compared with the other techniques. All samples positive by viral culture or p24 antigen assay were also positive in the RNA PCR. For each of the three assays, the number of positive results obtained correlated with the disease stage. The estimated mean number of HIV-1 RNA copies was significantly higher in symptomatic patients (22,750 copies per ml) than in asymptomatic patients (1,820 copies per ml). It was also higher in samples positive for viral culture than in culture-negative samples. No close correlation was found between the amount of HIV-1 RNA and the amount of p24 antigen or the titer of infectious virus in plasma or between this titer and the level of p24 antigen. The plasma RNA PCR may be a useful additional marker of disease progression and may be valuable for monitoring the effects of antiviral therapy."
10430,0.005,1.0000,"Virus replication in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individual, as determined by the steady-state level of plasma viremia, reflects a complex balance of viral and host factors. We have previously demonstrated that immunization of HIV-infected individuals with the common recall antigen, tetanus toxoid, disrupts this steady state, resulting in transient bursts of plasma viremia after immunization. The present study defines the viral genetic basis for the transient bursts in viremia after immune activation. Tetanus immunization was associated with dramatic and generally reversible shifts in the composition of plasma viral quasispecies. The viral bursts in most cases reflected a nonspecific increase in viral replication secondary to an expanded pool of susceptible CD4(+) T cells. An exception to this was in a patient who harbored viruses of differing tropisms (syncytium inducing and non-syncytium inducing [NSI]). In this situation, immunization appeared to select for the replication of NSI viruses. In one of three patients, the data suggested that immune activation resulted in the appearance in plasma of virus induced from latently infected cells. These findings illustrate certain mechanisms whereby antigenic stimulation may influence the dynamics of HIV replication, including the relative expression of different viral variants."
5035,0.005,1.0000,"Long-term nonprogressive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and its transition to progressive infection presents an opportunity to identify the molecular determinants of HIV-1 attenuation and pathogenesis. We studied an individual who underwent a transition from long-term nonprogressive to rapidly progressive infection. Because HIV-1 RNA genomes in plasma represent replicating virus, we developed a technique to clone full-length HIV-1 RNA genomes from plasma and used this technique to obtain clones from this individual before and during the transition. Most clones assayed were infectious, demonstrating that the RNA genomes encoded viable virus. Analysis of 20 complete HIV-1 RNA genomic sequences revealed one major difference between sequences found during the two phases of infection. During the nonprogressive phase, the predominant sequences had a large deletion in an Sp1-binding site and adjacent promoter in the U3 part of the long terminal repeat (LTR); when the infection became progressive, all viruses had intact Sp1 and promoter sequences and were derived from a minor species present earlier. Analysis of 184 clones of the LTR region obtained at five time points spanning a 7-year period confirmed this switch. In an in vitro assay, the deletion downregulated LTR-driven transcription of a reporter gene. In addition, analysis of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes predicted from the complete viral RNA genomes revealed multiple potential escape mutants that accumulated by the time of progression. These studies suggest that during the nonprogressive phase, the Sp1 enhancer-promoter deletion is likely to have played a role in decreasing replication, thereby attenuating HIV-1. The accumulation of CTL escape mutants suggests that a breakdown in immunologic surveillance may have allowed proliferation of intact virus, thus leading to rapid disease progression. These data reveal the viral and immune interactions characterizing a transition from long-term nonprogressive to rapidly progressive infection."
19037,0.005,1.0000,"New HIV diagnoses among men having sex with men (MSM) have not decreased appreciably in most countries, even though care and prevention services have been scaled up substantially in the past 20 years. To maximize the impact of prevention strategies, it is crucial to quantify the sources of transmission at the population level. We used viral sequence and clinical patient data from one of Europe's nationwide cohort studies to estimate probable sources of transmission for 617 recently infected MSM. Seventy-one percent of transmissions were from undiagnosed men, 6% from men who had initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART), 1% from men with no contact to care for at least 18 months, and 43% from those in their first year of infection. The lack of substantial reductions in incidence among Dutch MSM is not a result of ineffective ART provision or inadequate retention in care. In counterfactual modeling scenarios, 19% of these past cases could have been averted with current annual testing coverage and immediate ART to those testing positive. Sixty-six percent of these cases could have been averted with available antiretrovirals (immediate ART provided to all MSM testing positive, and preexposure antiretroviral prophylaxis taken by half of all who test negative for HIV), but only if half of all men at risk of transmission had tested annually. With increasing sequence coverage, molecular epidemiological analyses can be a key tool to direct HIV prevention strategies to the predominant sources of infection, and help send HIV epidemics among MSM into a decisive decline."
4193,0.005,1.0000,"An increasing prevalence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) resistance in ART-experienced and ART-naive pregnant women has been reported. Some studies suggest that antiretroviral drug-resistant viruses might have decreased replication capacity and transmissibility. However, cases of perinatal transmission of multidrug-resistant HIV type-1 (HIV-1) have been described. Here, we report the case of one child with vertically-acquired multidrug-resistant HIV-1 and the outcome of a rescue therapy with a darunavir/ritonavir- and etravirine-containing antiretroviral regimen. During the 15 months of therapy, the child showed clinical improvement, including no side effects, persistent suppression of viral replication and a great increase in CD4+ T-cell count. Paediatric HIV specialists should be prepared to manage a small, but increasing, number of babies with a 'nightmare' multidrug-resistant virus with no available treatment options. The use of experimental agents might become a compelling issue in vertically HIV-infected children born in the era of highly active ART."
2134,0.005,1.0000,"It is not clear what effect socioeconomic factors have on adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among patients in low- and middle-income countries. We performed a systematic review of the association of socioeconomic status (SES) with adherence to treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS in low- and middle-income countries. We searched electronic databases to identify studies concerning SES and HIV/AIDS and collected data on the association between various determinants of SES (income, education, occupation) and adherence to ART in low- and middle-income countries. From 252 potentially-relevant articles initially identified, 62 original studies were reviewed in detail, which contained data evaluating the association between SES and adherence to treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS. Income, level of education, and employment/occupational status were significantly and positively associated with the level of adherence in 15 studies (41.7%), 10 studies (20.4%), and 3 studies (11.1%) respectively out of 36, 49, and 27 studies reviewed. One study for income, four studies for education, and two studies for employment found a negative and significant association with adherence to ART. However, the aforementioned SES determinants were not found to be significantly associated with adherence in relation to 20 income-related (55.6%), 35 education-related (71.4%), 23 employment/occupational status-related (81.5%), and 2 SES-related (100%) studies. The systematic review of the available evidence does not provide conclusive support for the existence of a clear association between SES and adherence to ART among adult patients infected with HIV/ AIDS in low- and middle-income countries. There seems to be a positive trend among components of SES (income, education, employment status) and adherence to antiretroviral therapy in many of the reviewed studies."
19772,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral treatment (ART) is expanding to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected persons in low-middle income countries, thanks to a public health approach. With 3 available drug classes, 2 ART sequencing lines are programmatically foreseen. The emergence and transmission of viral drug resistance represents a challenge to the efficacy of ART. Knowledge of HIV-1 drug resistance selection associated with specific drugs and regimens and the consequent activity of residual drug options are essential in programming ART sequencing options aimed at preserving ART efficacy for as long as possible. This article determines optimal ART sequencing options for overcoming HIV-1 drug resistance in resource-limited settings, using currently available drugs and treatment monitoring opportunities. From the perspective of drug resistance and on the basis of limited virologic monitoring data, optimal sequencing seems to involve use of a tenofovir-containing nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor-based first-line regimen, followed by a zidovudine-containing, protease inhibitor (PI)-based second-line regimen. Other options and their consequences are explored by considering within-class and between-class sequencing opportunities, including boosted PI monotherapies and future options with integrase inhibitors. Nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor resistance pathways in HIV-1 subtype C suggest an additional reason for accelerating stavudine phase out. Viral load monitoring avoids the accumulation of resistance mutations that significantly reduce the activity of next-line options. Rational use of resources, including broader access to viral load monitoring, will help ensure 3 lines of fully active treatment options, thereby increasing the duration of ART success."
4394,0.005,1.0000,"Whether the amount of HIV DNA is associated with the subtype of HIV-1 after antiretroviral therapy (ART) has not been reported. In the present study, the amount of HIV DNA and RNA and CD4+T counts in blood and semen prior to and after 18 months of ART were compared in 48 patients infected by CRF01_AE, subtype B or CRF07_BC of HIV-1. Viral RNA was suppressed and CD4 cell count recovery achieved in all patients. The level of HIV DNA were similar before ART; however, patients with CRF01_AE had less HIV DNA after ART than those with subtype B and CRF07_BC infection. According to prediction of co-receptor usage by Geno2Pheno and PSSM in combination, more than 35.6% of clones for CRF01_AE were predicted as CXCR4-using before ART, whereas less than 6% of those for subtype B and CRF07_BC were predicted as CXCR4-using. After 18 months of ART, no CXCR4-using clones were predicted in any of the subtypes. Despite more HIV RNA and fewer CD4 + T cells in patients with CRF01_AE before therapy, no significant differences (P > 0.05) in viral RNA or CD4 cell counts were observed between the subtypes after 18 months of ART. Thus, 18 months of antiretroviral therapy was more efficient in patients with CRF01_AE. Considering that successful ART dramatically reduces the viral load in both blood and semen, risks of sexual transmission of HIV were reduced, contributing to prevention of rapid spread of HIV among men who have sex with men in the region."
4695,0.005,1.0000,"In China, HIV-1-infected patients typically receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) that includes lamivudine (3TC) as a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) (ART-3TC). Previous studies from certain developed countries have shown that, in ART-3TC, 3TC-resistant HBV progressively emerges at an annual rate of 15-20% in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV. This scenario in China warrants investigation because >10% of all HIV-infected patients in China are HBV carriers. We measured the occurrence of 3TC-resistant HBV during ART-3TC for HIV-HBV coinfection and also tested the effect of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) used as an additional RTI (ART-3TC/TDF) in a cohort study in China. We obtained 200 plasma samples collected from 50 Chinese patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV (positive for hepatitis B surface antigen) and examined them for the prevalence of 3TC-resistant HBV by directly sequencing PCR products that covered the HBV reverse-transcriptase gene. We divided the patients into ART-3TC and ART-3TC/TDF groups and compared the efficacy of treatment and incidence of drug-resistance mutation between the groups. HIV RNA and HBV DNA loads drastically decreased in both ART-3TC and ART-3TC/TDF groups. In the ART-3TC group, HBV breakthrough or insufficient suppression of HBV DNA loads was observed in 20% (10/50) of the patients after 96-week treatment, and 8 of these patients harbored 3TC-resistant mutants. By contrast, neither HBV breakthrough nor treatment failure was recorded in the ART-3TC/TDF group. All of the 3TC-resistant HBV mutants emerged from the cases in which HBV DNA loads were high at baseline. Our results clearly demonstrated that ART-3TC is associated with the emergence of 3TC-resistant HBV in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and that ART-3TC/TDF reduces HBV DNA loads to an undetectable level. These findings support the use of TDF-based treatment regimens for patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV. "

YMDD variants were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment-length polymorphism assays. After 1 year, YMDD variants were detected in 81 (24%) of 335 patients. In these patients, the median serum HBV DNA concentration at 1 year was <20% of the baseline level, and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) levels and liver histologic findings had significantly improved. In patients with YMDD variants who were treated for up to 4 years, median HBV DNA and ALT levels showed improvements. Sex, baseline body mass index, and HBV DNA level were associated with emergence of YMDD variants.

The article reports a study describing living conditions, sex risk behaviors, knowledge about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and perceptions of AIDS risk among female sexual partners of IVDUs living in southern Arizona. One hundred and twenty-three women who did not use IV drugs but had had sex with an IVDU in the last 6 months were interviewed. Eighty percent belonged to an ethnic minority, and 20% were white. Condom use was infrequent regardless of the number of sexual contacts. Sex was primarily heterosexual, with unsafe vaginal intercourse being the most common practice. Barriers to condom use were self-related and partner related. Some women lacked knowledge about sexual transmission of AIDS. All women reported getting AIDS information in the last 6 months and felt some risk of contracting the disease. AIDS risk reduction interventions should include HIV education and focus on barriers to condom use."

In an open-label, randomized, four-treatment crossover design, 24 patients seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) received in random order multiple oral doses of ganciclovir 1,000 mg every 3 hours (six times a day), 1,000 mg four times a day, and 1,000 mg three times a day and a single 5-mg/kg intravenous infusion (over 1 hour) of ganciclovir. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic determinations were obtained on day 3 of each oral regimen and on the day of the intravenous infusion over a 24-hour time interval. Mean steady-state average serum concentrations of ganciclovir were 0.54, 0.79, and 0.99 microgram/mL, respectively, with the 3, 4, and 6 g/day oral regimens. The steady-state area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-24) for the 6,000 mg/day oral regimen approached that of the single-dose intravenous regimen. There was a proportional increase in AUC0-24 between the 3 and 4 g/day dosage regimens, but not between the 4 and 6 g/day regimens. This suggests nonlinear absorption of ganciclovir at higher dosages, although the departure from proportionality was less than 11%."

In the same period there were 8459 laboratory reports of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody-positive tests. Since 1985 the median interval of 2 months between diagnosis and report of AIDS has not changed. Most patients with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) as an indicator disease when AIDS was diagnosed were homosexual/bisexual males; the proportion in this category has declined. The data support the hypothesis for a co-factor in the aetiology of KS in homosexual/bisexual males and that the effect of this co-factor has progressively weakened. Injecting drugs was a risk factor for 48 patients with AIDS (4%), half of whom were also homosexual/bisexual males, and for 1406 (17%) persons reported as HIV antibody-positive of whom 63 were also homosexual/bisexual males. HIV-infected persons injecting drugs were reported from all parts of the U.K., apart from Northern Ireland, but the cumulative rate per million population in Scotland for such persons was more than six times the rate elsewhere. In the collaborative laboratory study in England, 2.3% of over 3000 persons injecting drugs were HIV antibody-positive; among those who were asymptomatic the prevalence in London was 7.1% compared with 1.3% outside London. By 1987, the incidence rate of acute hepatitis B in persons injecting drugs in England had fallen to less than a third of that for 1985; in Scotland the figure for 1987 was only a quarter of that for 1985. Since the current rate of HIV transmission among persons in the U.K. injecting drugs is unknown, monitoring the prevalence of HIV in this risk group should be intensified."
8569,0.005,1.0000,"With the recent demonstration in the RV144 Thai trial that a vaccine regimen that does not elicit neutralizing antibodies or cytotoxic T lymphocytes may confer protection against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, attention has turned to nonneutralizing antibodies as a possible mechanism of vaccine protection. In the current study, we evaluated the kinetics of the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) response during acute and chronic SIVmac251 infection of rhesus monkeys. We first adapted a flow cytometry-based ADCC assay, evaluating the use of different target cells as well as different strategies for quantitation of activated natural killer (NK) cells. We found that the use of SIVmac251 Env gp130-coated target cells facilitates analyses of ADCC activity with a higher degree of sensitivity than the use of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected target cells; however, the kinetics of the measured responses were the same using these different target cells. By comparing NK cell expression of CD107a with NK cell expression of other cytokines or chemokine molecules, we found that measuring CD107a expression is sufficient for evaluating the anti-SIV function of NK cells. We also showed that ADCC responses can be detected as early as 3 weeks after SIVmac251 infection and that the magnitude of this antibody response is inversely associated with plasma viral RNA levels in animals with moderate to high levels of viral replication. However, we also demonstrated an association between NK cell-mediated ADCC responses and the amount of SIVmac251 gp140 binding antibody that developed after viral infection. This final observation raises the possibility that the antibodies that mediate ADCC are a subset of the antibodies detected in a binding assay and arise within weeks of infection."

16219,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to determine the population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of atazanavir in adult human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients to build up a Bayesian strategy for dosage regimen individualization. This was an observational study of patients treated with the once-daily regimen atazanavir associated with 100 mg of ritonavir. Blood samples were drawn at steady state at various times ranging from 1 to 26 hours postdose. Atazanavir plasma concentrations were determined by a validated reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method. PK analysis of the atazanavir population was performed using a nonlinear mixed-effects model (NONMEM version 6). One hundred eighty-seven patients were included in the study. The atazanavir doses prescribed were 300 mg (n = 169), 400 mg (n = 12), 200 mg (n = 1), and 150 mg (n = 5). The atazanavir population PK was described using a 1-compartment model with first-order absorption. Mean PK parameter estimations (95% confidence interval, coefficients of variation %) were as follows: oral clearance (CL) = 7.6 L/h (6.9-8.3; 34%), volume of distribution (V) = 80.8 L (67.4-94; 37%), and absorption constant rate (Ka) = 1.05 hours (0.01-2.09; 156%). The mean estimated half-life (T-half) was 7.5 hours (95% confidence interval: 7.2 -7.8 hours). The estimated T-half of atazanavir was in agreement with that previously reported of 8.6 and 8.8 hours. We observed a wide interpatient variability for the PK parameters, especially for Ka. This population approach allowed us to determine atazanavir PK parameters in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients in a real-life context and to perform Bayesian analysis to predict Ctrough from samples collected at any moment during the dosing interval. This could therefore improve therapeutic drug monitoring interpretations and provide an interesting tool for correlation with virologic data."

Because the metabolism of pravastatin is independent of the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4, this drug has become the preferred statin for treatment of dyslipidemia associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, with no cases of serious toxicity such as rhabdomyolysis reported to date. We report an HIV-infected patient receiving antiretroviral regimen consisting of atazanavir, ritonavir, emtricitabine and tenofovir who developed severe rhabdomyolysis approximately 4 months after increasing his pravastatin dose from 40 to 80 mg daily. His symptoms resolved within 10 days after the discontinuation of pravastatin and antiretroviral therapy.

15856,0.005,1.0000,"Improved awareness of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission has contributed to the overall decline in the HCV infection rate in some developing countries including Thailand. Chronic HCV infection in some rural Thai communities, however, presents a challenge in the efforts to treat and manage HCV-related diseases. Published and unpublished studies have suggested an unusually high incidence of HCV infection in a Thai province of Phetchabun compared to elsewhere in Thailand. To determine the magnitude of HCV infection and identify potential factors contributing to the higher rate of HCV infection in this province, we performed a population-based study in Phetchabun (n = 1667) and the neighboring Khon Kaen province (n = 1410) where HCV prevalence is much lower. Individuals between 30 and 64 years old completed detailed questionnaires designed to identify HCV risk factors and provided blood samples for anti-HCV antibody screening. The anti-HCV seropositive rates were 15.5% (259/1667) in Phetchabun and 3.6% (51/1410) in Khon Kaen. Positive samples were subsequently genotyped for HCV core gene sequence and assessed for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and human immunodeficiency virus antigen/antibody (HIV Ag/Ab). More individuals in Phetchabun possessed the combined presence of HBsAg (5.0%) and HIV Ag/Ab (0.4%) than those in Khon Kaen (3.9% HBsAg and 0.0% HIV Ag/Ab). While male gender, intravenous drug use (IVDU) and tattoos were significant HCV risk factors in both provinces (p <0.05), education less than high school and agriculture-related occupation were additionally associated with HCV in Phetchabun. HCV genotypes 6, 3, and 1 were identified in similar frequency in both provinces. We estimated that prevalence of HCV seropositivity and viremic carriers were higher in Phetchabun (143 and 111 per 1000) than in Khon Kaen (34 and 22 per 1000). Finally, we derived a simple risk factor-based scoring system as a useful preclinical tool to screen individuals at risk of chronic HCV infection prior to intervention. Knowledge gained from this study will assist in HCV screening and promote access to anti-viral treatment in high-risk groups."

Our objective was to examine to what extent this association holds among HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infected people. We used data from a prospective cohort study of HIV-HCV co-infected people in Canada. FI was measured using the ten-item adult scale of Health Canada's Household Food Security Survey Module and was classified into three categories: food secure, moderate FI, and severe FI. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) and was classified into absence or presence of depressive symptoms. FI, depressive symptoms, and other covariates were updated every 6 months. The association between FI and depressive symptoms was assessed using a stabilized inverse probability weighted marginal structural model. The study sample included 725 HIV-HCV co-infected people with 1973 person-visits over 3 years of follow up. At baseline, 23% of participants experienced moderate food insecurity, 34% experienced severe food insecurity and 52% had depressive symptoms. People experiencing moderate FI had 1.63 times (95% CI 1.44-1.86) the risk of having depressive symptoms and people experiencing severe FI had 2.01 times (95% CI 1.79-2.25) the risk of having depressive symptoms compared to people who were food secure. FI is a risk factor for developing depressive symptoms among HIV-HCV co-infected people. Food supplementation, psychosocial support and counseling may improve patient health outcomes."

Eight studies looking at some degree of measurement of stigma and discrimination in Nigeria were reviewed in an attempt to investigate the cultural context of stigma, health seeking behavior and the role both perceived and community stigma play in HIV prevention. Results suggest that reducing stigma does increase the individual as well as community acceptance of people living with HIV-AIDS (PLWHAs), but long term studies are needed.

8023,0.005,1.0000,"Visceral leishmaniasis is an endemic infection in Mediterranean countries, where it has become a frequent complication of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The incidence of visceral leishmaniasis is increasing in Spain due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related cases, but some aspects of its epidemiology, clinical features, and management remain unknown. In addition, no comparative clinical studies about the disease in HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected patients have been reported. During a 24-year period, 120 cases of visceral leishmaniasis were diagnosed at our institution and 80 (66%) were associated with HIV infection. The mean age at diagnosis was higher in HIV-infected that in non-HIV-infected patients (33.2 versus 23.2 yr; p = 0.002), but the male/female ratio was similar in both groups. The main risk factor for HIV infection was intravenous drug abuse (78.7%). The clinical presentation of leishmaniasis was similar in both groups, but HIV-infected patients had a lower frequency of splenomegaly than HIV-negative individuals (80.8% versus 97.4%; p = 0.02). HIV-infected patients had a greater frequency and degree of leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Most of them were profoundly immunosuppressed (mean CD4+ lymphocyte count, 90 cells/mm3) at the time of diagnosis of leishmaniasis, and 53.7% had AIDS. The sensitivity of serologic studies for Leishmania was significantly lower in HIV-infected than in non-HIV-infected patients (50% versus 80%; p < 0.001), but the diagnostic yield of bone marrow aspirate (67.1% versus 79.4%) and bone marrow culture (62.9% versus 66.6%) was similar in both groups. After initial treatment, the response rate was significantly lower in HIV-infected than in non-HIV-infected individuals (54.8% versus 89.7%; p = 0.001). The relapse rate was 46.2% and 7.5%, respectively (p < 0.001). Secondary prophylaxis with antimonial compounds or amphotericin B seems to be useful in preventing relapses in HIV-infected patients. The mortality rate was higher (53.7% versus 7.5%; p < 0.001) and the median survival time shorter (25 versus > 160 mo; p < 0.001) in AIDS patients than in HIV-negative individuals. Although leishmaniasis could contribute to death in a significant number of HIV-infected patients, it was the main cause of death in only a few of them. The CD4+ lymphocyte count and the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy and secondary prophylaxis for leishmaniasis were the most significant prognostic factors for survival in AIDS patients. Visceral leishmaniasis behaves as an opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals and should be considered as an AIDS-defining disease."

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study in HIV-1-infected, multidrug-experienced adults (≥18 years old) with plasma HIV-1-RNA <400 copies/ml for at least 4 months on an enfuvirtide-containing therapy between 2005 and 2010, in whom the attending physician switched from enfuvirtide to raltegravir. Effectiveness endpoints were measured at week 48 after switch. Analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat basis and two strategies for handling missing outcome data were used (hereafter, strategies 1 and 2). Overall, 87 patients were eligible for analysis. At baseline, the median CD4(+) T cell count was 400 cells/μl and 91.9% of patients had <50 HIV-1-RNA copies/ml. At week 48, the proportions of patients with plasma HIV-1-RNA <50 and <400 copies/ml were, respectively, 86.2% (95% CI=77.1; 92.7%) and 88.5% (95% CI=79.9; 94.3%) (strategies 1 and 2) and 89.7% (95% CI=81.3; 95.2%) and 90.8% (95% CI=82.7; 95.9%) (strategies 1 and 2). This was a -10.3% (95% CI=-2.8; -17.9%) and -9.2% (95% CI=-2; -16.4%) difference from baseline in the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1-RNA <400 copies/ml. The median increase in CD4(+) T cell counts was 41 and 64 cells/μl (p<0.001) (strategies 1 and 2). No patient withdrew raltegravir or developed opportunistic infections, but one was diagnosed with HIV-related dementia. In conclusion, switching from enfuvirtide to raltegravir in patients on a virologically suppressive regimen is an effective strategy even in a Brazilian clinical setting."

The incidence rate of HIV infection was 7.4 per 100 person-years, equivalent to a one-year risk of 7.3%. Relative risk was higher in subjects who had been using intravenous drugs for less than 2 years (RR = 2.3). In a case-control analysis, recent frequent syringe sharing was the behavioral variable most strongly associated with HIV infection, with the highest risk in subjects sharing often (OR = 6.1, 90% CI = 2.6-14.7). We found no association with the use of cocaine in addition to heroin nor with sexual habits. Among biologic variables, relative risks were increased in individuals whose T4-lymphocyte count was lower than 1,000 at first visit (RR = 8.5, 90% CI = 2.9-24.3) or who were carrying HBsAg (RR = 1.9, 90% CI = 0.8-4.2)."

One hundred two patients with documented HIV status (45 HIV-seropositive patients and 57 HIV-seronegative patients) were included in the analysis. Eleven patients (6 HIV-seropositive patients and 5 HIV-seronegative patients) died in the hospital. Staphylococcus aureus, the most common etiologic pathogen causing IE in our series, was isolated from 32 HIV-seropositive patients (71.1%) and 32 HIV-seronegative patients (56.1%). A clear inverse correlation between mortality rate and CD4 cell count was demonstrated (r = -.625; P < .001). Both univariate and multivariate analyses supported the finding of significantly higher mortality rates among patients with CD4 cell counts of < 200/mm3 than among patients with CD4 cell counts of > 500/mm3 (OR, 14.7; 95% CI, 2.64-81.9)."

Guidelines have been updated in order to facilitate earlier HIV diagnosis, introducing ""indicator condition-guided HIV testing"". In this study, we analysed the frequency of LD and associated risk factors. We retrospectively identified those cases that could be considered missed opportunities for an earlier diagnosis. All patients newly diagnosed with HIV infection who attended Hospital La Princesa, Madrid (Spain) between 2007 and 2014 were analysed. We collected epidemiological, clinical and immunological data. We also reviewed electronic medical records from the year before the HIV diagnosis to search for medical consultations due to clinical indicators. HIV infection was diagnosed in 354 patients. The median CD4 count at presentation was 352 cells/mm(3). Overall, 158 patients (50%) met the definition of LD, and 97 (30.7%) the diagnosis of advanced disease. LD was associated with older age and was more frequent amongst immigrants. Heterosexual relations and injection drug use were more likely to be the reasons for LD than relations between men who have sex with men. During the year preceding the diagnosis, 46.6% of the patients had sought medical advice owing to the presence of clinical indicators that should have led to HIV testing. Of those, 24 cases (14.5%) were classified as missed opportunities for earlier HIV diagnosis because testing was not performed. According to these results, all health workers should pursue early HIV diagnosis through the proper implementation of HIV testing guidelines. Such an approach would prove directly beneficial to the patient and indirectly beneficial to the general population through the reduction in the risk of transmission."

Severe cutaneous conditions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are associated with high morbidity and, notably for toxic epidermal necrolysis, high mortality. Although overall mortality from human immunodeficiency virus has dramatically declined owing to highly active antiretroviral therapy, these antiretroviral regimens have been associated with a wide spectrum of severe cutaneous reactions. We reviewed case reports and clinical trials in the English literature on Medline (1966 to 2001) and Aidsline (1980 to 2000) to determine the prevalence of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis attributable to the current FDA approved antiretroviral medications. We identified a total of approximately 50 patients who had Stevens-Johnson syndrome and/or toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with the use of 5 antiretroviral medications: 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, zidovudine (2 patients) and didanosine (1 patient); 1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, nevirapine (42 patients); and 2 protease inhibitors, indinavir (1 patient) and amprenavir (an unspecified number within the 1% of over 1400 patients experiencing severe life-threatening reactions). Of the reports that specified the onset time of adverse reaction after initiation of treatment, 86% (19/22) of patients experienced reactions within 4 weeks. Ten of the approximately 50 patients were diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, due to specific antiretroviral medication, or a combination of medications identified by either resolution upon withdrawal, consistent biopsy findings or a positive rechallenge.

A cross sectional analysis was of 11,032 HIV-infected patients enrolled in the Integrated HIV Care Program from May 2005 to April 2012 and Epi-info 3.5 was used to determine the serological prevalence of chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C. The mean ± standard deviation age of patients was 36 ± 8.4 years (adult cohort) and 7 ± 3 years (paediatric cohort). The sero prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C (anti HCV antibodies) and triple infection are 8.7%, 5.3% and 0.35%, respectively. Men who have sex with men are at the highest risk of being co-infected with hepatitis B while intravenous drug users are at the highest risk of being co-infected with hepatitis C. It is important to screen for hepatitis B and C in HIV infected people in order to provide quality care for HIV patients with co-infection. "
2041,0.005,1.0000,"A variety of factors can contribute to the failure of combination antiretroviral therapy to durably suppress viral replication in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Patients who have a low CD4(+) T cell count or high plasma viral load before therapy is initiated are at high risk for subsequent virological failure. Previous therapy is also a strong determinant of subsequent virological response, presumably because of pre-existing viral resistance. Drug exposure, as determined by adherence, drug absorption, and drug metabolism, has a significant impact on future long-term virological responses. Although definitive proof is lacking, some tissues may have limited drug penetration, thus allowing for ongoing viral replication. Understanding why combination therapy fails for HIV-infected patients may allow clinicians to individualize treatment strategies. Unfortunately, almost any factor (drug, host, or viral) that leads to virological failure of an initial combination regimen is likely to persist-and perhaps become more challenging-once a salvage regimen is initiated."

Candidal vaginal colonization was defined as a positive culture for Candida spp. in an asymptomatic woman. From January 1998 to July 2002 we analysed 214 women. The baseline prevalence of candidal vaginal colonization was 16.8%. In the logistic regression analysis, the time since HIV infection > or =36 months (odds ratio [OR] = 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.016-0.53, P = 0.002) and a plasma viral load > or =10,000 copies/mL (OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.03-14.9, P = 0.045) were independently associated with candidal colonization.

To evaluate the effects of several variables on overall survival (OS), Kaplan-Meier statistics and extended Cox regression analysis were performed. Response to HAART was used as a time-dependent variable and was defined as an increase of >0.1 x 10(9) CD4 cells/l and/or at least one viral load <500 copies/ml during the first 2 years following diagnosis of HIV-HD. Fifty-seven patients with HIV-HD diagnosed between 1990 and 2002 were included in the study. In the Cox model, the only factors independently associated with OS were HAART response [relative hazard (RH) 0.19; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06-0.60], complete remission (RH 0.30, 95% CI 0.13-0.72), and age <or=45 years (RH 0.23; 95% CI 0.09-0.60). Median survival time in patients without HAART response was 18.6 months, whereas the median survival time in patients with HAART response was not reached (89% OS at 24 months).

In models adjusted for age, sex, year of visit, smoking status, alcohol intake, regular exercise, education level, and body mass index, the adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for incident NAFLD comparing HBsAg-positive to HBsAg-negative participants was 0.83 (0.73-0.94). After introducing HBV infection and confounders (including homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and metabolic factors) as time-dependent exposures, the association between HBV infection and decreased risk of incident NAFLD was attenuated but persisted. These associations were consistently observed across clinically relevant, prespecified subgroups."
19870,0.005,1.0000,"Influenza vaccine is recommended for HIV-1-infected patients. The present prospective study was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy and immunologic responses to the vaccine. From November 1 to December 27, 2002, 262 HIV-1-infected patients received a trivalent influenza subunit vaccine, whereas 66 did not. Influenza illness occurred in 16 vaccinated and 14 nonvaccinated patients (incidence = 6.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 4%-10%] in vaccinated vs. 21.2% [CI: 13%-35%] in nonvaccinated persons, P < 0.001; relative risk = 0.29 [CI: 0.14-0.55]). Influenza vaccine provided clinically effective protection against influenza illness in HIV-1-infected patients. In baseline antibody-negative patients, anti-H1 and anti-H3 antibody responses to the vaccination were significant in those patients with a CD4 count >200 cells/muL compared with those with a CD4 count <200 cells/muL (P < 0.05). In contrast, in baseline antibody-positive patients, good antibody responses were observed irrespective of CD4 counts, like the healthy controls. Based on these results, annual vaccination is recommended. Specific CD4 responses correlated with HIV-1 viral load (VL), especially in patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) compared with those without HAART (P < 0.01), although the clinical efficacy did not correlate with HIV-1 VL. HAART may enhance the immunologic efficacy of influenza vaccine."
286,0.005,1.0000,"The accurate marker to assess the risk of disease progression in HIV disease is CD4 count. CD4 decline to <200 cells/mm3 prompts the patients to have risk of opportunistic infections. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in asymptomatic HIV-infected patients who had CD4 count>200 cell/mm3, were antiretroviral naive, and had ≥1-year follow-up. Eighty patients, with mean age of 36.4 (standard deviation [SD]=9.1) years and 58.8% females, were analyzed. The mean (SD) baseline CD4 count was 423 (119) cells/mm3. During the median (IQR) time of 29.0 (14.1-49.6) months, 26.3% had CD4 declined to <200 cells/mm3. From Cox proportional hazard model, only baseline CD4 count<350 cells/mm3 was significantly associated with rapid decline in CD4 count (HR 4.208; 95%CI, 1.428-12.397; P=.009). Age, gender, comorbid disease, risk of HIV infection, duration of HIV diagnosis, and body weight were not associated with rapid CD4 decline. This indicates that asymptomatic patients with CD4 count<350 cells/mm3 are at priority for antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings."

The authors estimated the effect of time-varying incident TB on time to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related mortality using a joint marginal structural Cox model. Between 1995 and 2002, 1,412 HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected women enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study were followed for a median of 6 years. Twenty-nine women incurred incident TB, and 222 died of AIDS-related causes. Accounting for age, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA level, serum albumin level, and non-TB AIDS at study entry, as well as for time-varying CD4 cell count, CD4 cell count nadir, HIV-1 RNA level, peak HIV-1 RNA level, serum albumin level, HIV-related symptoms, non-TB AIDS, anti-Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis, antiretroviral therapy, and household income, the hazard ratio for AIDS-related death comparing time after incident TB with time before incident TB was 4.0 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2, 14). The effect of incident TB on mortality was similar among highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-exposed women (hazard ratio = 4.3, 95% CI: 0.9, 22) and non-HAART-exposed women (hazard ratio = 3.9, 95% CI: 0.9, 17; interaction p = 0.91). Although results were imprecise because few women incurred TB, irrespective of HAART exposure, incident TB increases the hazard of AIDS-related death among HIV-infected women."
16024,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence is often high among female sex workers (FSWs) in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the dynamics of HIV infection in this key population is critical to developing appropriate prevention strategies. We aimed to describe the prevalence and associated risk factors among a sample of FSWs in Rwanda from a survey conducted in 2010. A cross-sectional biological and behavioral survey was conducted among FSWs in Rwanda. Time-location sampling was used for participant recruitment from 4 to 18 February 2010. HIV testing was done using HIV rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) as per Rwandan national guidelines at the time of the survey. Elisa tests were simultaneously done on all samples tested HIV-positive on RDT. Proportions were used for sample description; multivariable logistic regression model was performed to analyze factors associated with HIV infection. Of 1338 women included in the study, 1112 consented to HIV testing, and the overall HIV prevalence was 51.0%. Sixty percent had been engaged in sex work for less than five years and 80% were street based. In multivariable logistic regression, HIV prevalence was higher in FSWs 25 years or older (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.83, 95% [confidence interval (CI): 1.42-2.37]), FSWs with consistent condom use in the last 30 days (aOR = 1.39, [95% CI: 1.05-1.82]), and FSWs experiencing at least one STI symptom in the last 12 months (aOR = 1.74 [95% CI: 1.34-2.26]). There was an inverse relationship between HIV prevalence and comprehensive HIV knowledge (aOR = 0.65, [95% CI: 0.48-0.88]). HIV prevalence was high among a sample of FSWs in Rwanda, and successful prevention strategies should focus on HIV education, treatment of sexually transmitted infections, and proper and consistent condom use using an outreach approach."

17502,0.005,1.0000,"Concerns about the risks of HIV infection among drug injectors have eclipsed concerns about the prevalence and transmission of hepatitis, and in particular hepatitis B virus infection. Findings are reported from surveys undertaken with two separate community-recruited samples of drug injectors in London collected in 1992 (n = 505) and in 1993 (n = 507). Anonymized confirmed testing of saliva shows 51.5% of drug injectors in 1992 and 47.9% in 1993 to be antibody positive to the core antigen of hepatitis B virus (anti-HBc). Approximately half of the drug injectors confirmed as anti-HBc positive were unaware that they had been infected with hepatitis. Anti-HIV-1 prevalence was considerably lower at 7.0% in 1992 and 6.9% in 1993. Multivariate analyses showed anti-HBc positivity to be most likely among older injectors with longer injecting careers who had a history of having shared used needles and syringes. HIV-1 positivity was also associated with a history of having shared injecting equipment as well as with recent sharing (i.e. in the last 6 months). Unlike anti-HBc positivity, there were no associations between HIV-1 positivity and age or length of injecting career. Younger injectors with shorter injecting careers were more likely to report recent sharing of used injecting equipment than older injectors with longer injecting careers. We note the potential for continued transmission of HBV and HIV-1, particularly among younger injectors. We recommend an integrated strategy to maximize the health of drug injectors, of which HIV and HBV prevention is a part. There is a need to widen the availability of HBV vaccinations for HBV negative drug injectors and their sexual partners and for clear guidelines to drug injectors about the relative efficacy of bleach to disinfect injecting equipment of HBV and HIV."
393,0.005,1.0000,"In a very short period of time, availability of antiretroviral drugs has increased from one drug with very modest activity to 12 approved drugs with remarkable potency, particularly when used in combination. The additional availability of absolutely quantitative assays with a broad dynamic range to measure plasma HIV-1 RNA has dramatically changed the evaluation of these new antivirals and the management of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The approved antiretroviral drugs represent three novel classes including nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors as well as protease inhibitors. Clinical trials evaluating different combinations of these drugs have resulted in the generation of some basic guidelines for their appropriate use. These guidelines focus on using these drugs in complex, multidrug regimens with the ultimate goal to keep the viral burden, as measured by plasma viral RNA levels, as low as possible and for as long as possible on a drug regimen that is compatible with long-term tolerance and compliance. To maximize the potential of these new drugs and to avoid significant associated toxicities and drug interactions, the treating physician must be completely aware of the pharmacokinetics and unique antiviral properties of these drugs. This review focuses on these unique properties as well as provides general guidelines for their appropriate use."
3180,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B affects 5-10% of HIV patients in Western countries. Lamivudine should no longer be used as a single anti-HBV agent in HIV-HBV co-infected patients, given its limited antiviral potency and high risk of selection of resistance, which further results in wide cross-resistance to all other nucleoside analogues. Recent reports of transmission of lamivudine-resistant HBV in HIV patients are of especial concern, and large surveillance studies suggest that it may occur in up to 10% of new HBV infections in Western countries. Another worrisome aspect of the selection of lamivudine-resistant HBV is the potential for selection of vaccine escape mutants. Currently, tenofovir must be viewed as the drug of choice in HIV-HBV co-infected patients in whom antiretroviral therapy is advised. Its co-formulation with emtricitabine (Truvada) is particularly convenient for treating both HIV and HBV in co-infected individuals. While pegIFN-alpha monotherapy for 1 year may be considered for HIV-HBV coinfected individuals with good spontaneous HIV control (elevated CD4 cell count, low plasma HIV-RNA), and certain HBV features (genotype A, HBeAg+, low serum HBV-DNA and elevated ALT), it is clear that very few coinfected patients fulfill these criteria. In HBeAg-negative HIV patients, adefovir may be an option but the relatively low antiviral potency of this drug discourages its wide use. Given its potential anti-HIV activity, both entecavir and telbivudine must only be prescribed with antiretroviral agents. Lack of information about potential pharmacodynamic interactions between entecavir and abacavir (both are guanosine analogues) or between telbivudine and zidovudine or stavudine (all are thymidine analogues) further discourages their concomitant use. At this time, most experts agree that early introduction of anti-HBV active HAART is the best strategy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in HIV patients, and Truvada must be part of the triple regimen."
2587,0.005,1.0000,"This report updates the 1991 CDC recommendations for the management of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected health-care providers and students to reduce risk for transmitting HBV to patients during the conduct of exposure-prone invasive procedures (CDC. Recommendations for preventing transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus to patients during exposure-prone invasive procedures. MMWR 1991;40[No. RR-8]). This update reflects changes in the epidemiology of HBV infection in the United States and advances in the medical management of chronic HBV infection and policy directives issued by health authorities since 1991.   The primary goal of this report is to promote patient safety while providing risk management and practice guidance to HBV-infected health-care providers and students, particularly those performing exposure-prone procedures such as certain types of surgery. Because percutaneous injuries sustained by health-care personnel during certain surgical, obstetrical, and dental procedures provide a potential route of HBV transmission to patients as well as providers, this report emphasizes prevention of operator injuries and blood exposures during exposure-prone surgical, obstetrical, and dental procedures.   These updated recommendations reaffirm the 1991 CDC recommendation that HBV infection alone should not disqualify infected persons from the practice or study of surgery, dentistry, medicine, or allied health fields. The previous recommendations have been updated to include the following changes: no prenotification of patients of a health-care provider's or student's HBV status; use of HBV DNA serum levels rather than hepatitis B e-antigen status to monitor infectivity; and, for those health-care professionals requiring oversight, specific suggestions for composition of expert review panels and threshold value of serum HBV DNA considered ""safe"" for practice (<1,000 IU/ml). These recommendations also explicitly address the issue of medical and dental students who are discovered to have chronic HBV infection. For most chronically HBV-infected providers and students who conform to current standards for infection control, HBV infection status alone does not require any curtailing of their practices or supervised learning experiences. These updated recommendations outline the criteria for safe clinical practice of HBV-infected providers and students that can be used by the appropriate occupational or student health authorities to develop their own institutional policies. These recommendations also can be used by an institutional expert panel that monitors providers who perform exposure-prone procedures."
13504,0.005,1.0000,"Two groups of patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) maintenance were evaluated for their antibody response to non-structural c100/3 protein and structural core protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Forty-six patients (Group 1) never presented liver abnormalities during HD treatment, while 52 patients (Group 2) had either current or prior liver enzyme elevations. Prevalence rates of 32.6% and 41.3% were found for anti-c100/3 and anti-HCV core antibodies, respectively, in patients with silent infections (Group 1). The rate of anti-c100/3 in patients of Group 2 was 71.15% and reached 86.5% for anti-HCV core antibodies. The recognition of anti-c100/3 and anti-core antibodies was significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 1. A line immunoassay composed of structural and non-structural peptides was used as a confirmation assay. HBV infection, measured by the presence of anti-HBc antibodies, was observed in 39.8% of the patients. Six were HBsAg chronic carriers and 13 had naturally acquired anti-HBs antibodies. The duration of HD treatment was correlated with anti-HCV positivity. A high prevalence of 96.7% (Group 2) was found in patients who underwent more than 5 years of treatment. Our results suggest that anti-HCV core ELISA is more accurate for detecting HCV infection than anti-c100/3. Although the risk associated with the duration of HD treatment and blood transfusion was high, additional factors such as a significant non-transfusional spread of HCV seems to play a role as well. The identification of infective patients by more sensitive methods for HCV genome detection should help to control the transmission of HCV in the unit under study."
13065,0.005,1.0000,"It has been reported that hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA is present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), although it is unclear whether it actually replicates there or is adsorbed from serum. HBV DNA sequences from the core promoter and precore regions were amplified from PBMCs and serum taken from 13 patients with hepatitis B infection. Analysis by single strand conformation polymorphism, direct sequencing and cloning revealed identical HBV DNA sequences in both PBMCs and serum from five patients with acute hepatitis and in five out of eight patients with chronic hepatitis. However, in the remaining three chronic hepatitis cases, HBV DNA sequences in both PBMCs and serum were different: two patients harboured HBV DNA sequences from their PBMCs with deletions/insertions in the core promoter region and one patient harboured HBV DNA sequences from their PBMCs with two nucleotide substitutions. These findings point to a possible presence of independent HBV DNA replication in PBMCs."
15025,0.005,1.0000,"A lipodystrophic syndrome and metabolic abnormalities have been observed in HIV-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A murine model of lipodystrophy is associated with decreased levels of adiponectin, an adipocyte-secreted protein, the administration of which improves the metabolic syndrome in these mice. To investigate the association of adiponectin with metabolic changes in human lipodystrophy, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 112 HIV-infected patients treated with HAART. Mean adiponectin levels were higher in patients with no fat redistribution (FR) vs. FR (4.8 +/- 5.0 vs. 2.2 +/- 2.7 microg/ml, P < 0.01), but no significant differences in adiponectin levels were observed between FR subgroups. The difference in adiponectin levels between subjects with and without FR remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, leptin, HIV medication use, and CD4 count using logistic regression (odds ratio, 0.54, P = 0.008). Adiponectin was significantly correlated with triglycerides (r = -0.40), abdominal visceral fat (r = -0.35), extremity fat (r = 0.37), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (r = -0.28), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) use (r = -0.32), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (r = 0.41) using bivariate analysis (all P < 0.01). The association with HDL weakened but remained significant on multivariate analysis (standard beta = 0.29, P = 0.01). However, the association of adiponectin with HOMA-IR became nonsignificant after adjusting for NRTI use (standard beta = -0.15, P = 0.12), suggesting that changes in adiponectin levels may underlie the effect of NRTI use on insulin resistance. The associations of adiponectin with triglycerides and HOMA-IR were also slightly weakened after adjusting for visceral and extremity fat, indicating that adiponectin may, in part, mediate the effect of FR on triglycerides and insulin resistance. This study indicates that adiponectin is inversely correlated with abdominal visceral fat mass, serum triglycerides, and insulin resistance and is directly correlated with HDL and extremity fat in a sample of HIV-infected patients treated with HAART. The results also indicate that NRTI use may worsen insulin resistance by decreasing adiponectin levels. Thus, adiponectin replacement may be a potential treatment option to ameliorate the metabolic changes observed in this patient population."
1809,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is an uncommon disorder that usually is not due to hepatitis A or B virus infection. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) seropositivity is infrequently observed in aplastic anemia (AA) patients who have not been extensively transfused. However, HCV seropositivity may not be detected until several weeks or months after viral infection and AA patients may exhibit defective humoral immunity. Therefore, we evaluated sera from AA patients for the presence of HCV viremia using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based assay and several serologic assays for HCV antibodies. Serum samples from 90 AA patients who presented to the UCLA Medical Center between March 1984 and February 1990 were analyzed. Overall, 17 patients were found to have HCV viremia by RT-PCR assay, of whom 14 had a positive second-generation HCV enzyme immunoassay (EIA-2) and only 6 were EIA-1 reactive. The frequency of HCV viremia increased with the duration of time between diagnosis and sample procurement, and the number of blood products transfused prior to sampling (P = 0.026). No patient who received fewer than 20 U of blood products or who was sampled less than 20 days after diagnosis had a positive HCV RT-PCR result. Of four patients with hepatitis-associated AA (HAAA), one who was sampled 23 days after diagnosis had hepatitis C viremia and a reactive EIA-2 assay. Therefore, the high frequency of HCV viremia in this patient population is most likely due to transfusion with contaminated blood products prior to the introduction of routine blood donor screening for HCV."

A novel endpoint PCR method was used to analyse the prevalence of HTLV-1 proviral DNA in genomic DNA extracted from liquid based cytology (LBC) cervical smears and invasive cervical carcinomas (ICCs) obtained from human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+ve) and HIV-negative (HIV-ve) Kenyan women. Patient sociodemographic details were recorded by structured questionnaire and these data analysed with respect to HIV status, human papillomavirus (HPV) type (Papilocheck(®)) and cytology. This showed 22/113 (19.5%) of LBC's from HIV+ve patients were positive for HTLV-1 compared to 4/111 (3.6%) of those from HIV-ve women (p = 0.0002; odds ratio (OR) = 6.42 (2.07-26.56)). Only 1/37 (2.7%) of HIV+ve and none of the 44 HIV-ve ICC samples were positive for HTLV-1. There was also a significant correlation between HTLV-1 infection, numbers of sexual partners (p < 0.05) and smoking (p < 0.01). Using this unique method, these data suggest an unexpectedly high prevalence of HTLV-1 DNA in HIV+ve women in this geographical location. However, the low level of HTLV-1 detected in HIV+ve ICC samples was unexpected and the reasons for this are unclear."
14374,0.005,1.0000,"Persistent infection with parvovirus B19 (B19) is an important treatable cause of anemia in HIV-infected patients. B19 has a tropism for erythroid progenitors and causes pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). The failure to produce neutralizing antibodies to the virus following B19 infection in immunodeficient persons may result in persistent viremia and chronic PRCA (B19-PRCA). The seroprevalence rates for B19 in unselected persons with HIV infection are high, similar to those seen in the general population. Reports of B19-related anemia in HIV infected patients, however, are infrequent. A partial explanation may be that B19-PRCA is predominantly a complication associated with advanced immunodeficiency. The condition is probably underdiagnosed as well. The finding of an unexplained normocytic anemia with absent reticulocytes, in an afebrile HIV-infected patient without renal dysfunction suggests a diagnosis of B19-PRCA. The diagnosis is established when the following criteria are met: (1) bone marrow biopsy showing PRCA, (2) serum or bone marrow positivity for B19 DNA by PCR or dot-blot hybridization, and (C) no alternate explanation for the PRCA. Serological methods are unreliable for the diagnosis because these patients often lack IgM and IgG antibodies to B19. Nearly all patients with B19-PRCA respond to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) with a rise in the hemoglobin to levels appropriate for the clinical condition of the patient. An alternative explanation for the anemia must be sought in patients not responding to IVIg. Most patients with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts of < or = 100 cells/mm3 relapse to anemia, usually within 6 months of IVIg therapy. Such patients must be retreated with IVIg 2 g/kg given over 2 to 5 days. The routine use of maintenance IVIg 0.4 g/kg q 4wk may be considered in these patients to prevent relapse."
4524,0.005,1.0000,"Mutations of the precore region of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome have been associated with fulminant and severe chronic hepatitis. However uncertainty remains about the clinical significance and transmissibility of these mutant strains. A point mutation assay (PMA) was developed to identify qualitatively and quantitatively mutations affecting precore amino acids 1 and 28. We have analysed serum samples from six mother-infant pairs where perinatal transmission of HBV has occurred and where the mothers were HBV carriers without detectable serum HBeAg. In three cases fulminant hepatitis developed in the infant, in two cases acute hepatitis resolved, and in one case the infant was immunised and did not become infected. We also examined serum from a healthcare worker, an anti-HBe-seropositive HBV carrier, believed to have transmitted HBV infection to a patient. The PMA results were confirmed in all cases by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products using nested and double-nested PCR with primers to the precore and X region. Precore aa28 mutant-type virus was detected in the serum of one mother at the time of delivery of three of her children, two of whom developed fulminant hepatitis. Another mother of an infant with fulminant hepatitis had no precore mutations. In one mother-infant pair a mixed viral population was found; the acute hepatitis B in the infant resolved. The HBV sequence from the healthcare worker was also of aa28 mutant type. No mutations of aa1 were detected in any of the specimens. The study supports the association of precore mutations with some cases of transmission of HBV infection from HBeAg-negative mothers to their infants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
10133,0.005,1.0000,"The clinical relevance of viral blipping during nucleos (t) ide analogue (NA) treatment is unclear in chronic hepatitis B (CHB). We investigated the prevalence, risk factors and clinical outcomes for those with viral blipping during NA treatment. A retrospective cohort study investigated consecutively treated CHB patients from May 2008 to February 2015 on the NAs such as entecavir (ETV), tenofovir (TDF) and lamivudine (LAM). Included patients were previously treatment naive. Viral blipping was defined as serum HBV DNA >20 IU/mL on one occasion, and not >200 IU/mL, with subsequent measurement returning to undetectable levels, that is <20 IU/mL. A total of 242 treatment-compliant CHB patients were included with 44 (18.2%) experiencing viral blipping. In multivariable Cox regression, Asian race (HR=7.40, 95% CI 1.01-54.29, P<.049), LAM therapy (vs ETV/TDF, HR=2.53, 95% CI 1.29-4.95, P<.007), higher creatinine (per SD, HR=1.47, 95% CI 1.21-1.79, P<.001), HBeAg positivity (HR=2.68, 95% CI 1.39-5.03, P<.003) and longer time to achieve undetectable HBV DNA (per month, HR=1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08, P=.001) were associated with an increased risk of viral blipping. Viral blipping did not show any significant association with viral breakthrough, HBsAg loss, ALT flares or disease progression. Viral blipping is a frequent event during NA therapy; however, it did not lead to any clinically significant outcomes. Thus, it may not require more frequent blood work and patient visits in clinical practice."
18410,0.005,1.0000,"TT virus (TTV) is a newly discovered virus from a patient with post-transfusion hepatitis. We investigated the frequency and pathogenesis of TTV infection in children. A semi-nested PCR assay was used to amplify TTV-DNA in serum samples from 254 ambulatory children without liver disease, 20 with hepatitis of unknown etiology, and 18 transfusion recipients or hemophiliacs. In positive samples, TTV-DNA was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR using a fluorescent probe. We detected TTV-DNA in 20% of children with hepatitis of unknown etiology, which was not statistically different from the 23% prevalence in ambulatory children. In transfusion recipients or hemophiliacs, the frequency was higher (50%) than that in ambulatory children (P = 0.01). Among ambulatory children, TTV-DNA was frequently detected in children with acute gastroenteritis (36%). TTV-DNA was detected in 10% of the infants under 6 months old, and 20% of the children from 7 to 12 months old. The prevalence was constant after the age of 1 year; however, the copy number of TTV-DNA was significantly higher in children under 1 year of age (mean: 10(5.4) versus 10(3.8) copies/ml, P= 0.008). Finally, TTV-DNA was quantified serially in three children with chronic hepatitis who were positive for TTV-DNA. The presence or amount of TTV-DNA was unrelated to the serum alanine aminotransferase level. These results indicate that TTV infection is common in children. The larger quantity of TTV-DNA in infants and the high prevalence of TTV in children of all ages suggest that TTV may be transmitted in early childhood. Its relationship to hepatitis is doubtful in children."

The resultant glucose dysregulation is an important determinant of increased morbidity and mortality in liver and kidney recipients. This review highlights the concerns for outcomes in HCV-positive liver and kidney transplant patients with particular focus on the interrelationship between hepatitis C and diabetes.

Thirty-one patients treated with Peg-IFN alpha-2b 1.5 microg/kg/w plus ribavirine (RBV) (Peg-IFN alpha-2b Group) and 32 patients receiving Peg-IFN alpha-2a 180 microg/w plus RBV (Peg-IFN alpha-2a Group) were included. Depressive and neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life and adherence were assessed. Fifteen subjects (23%) discontinued therapy (p = 0.3, between groups). Overall, 37 patients presented mild to moderate depressive symptoms, 9 moderate to severe and 3 severe, without differences between groups. Patients in Peg-IFN alpha-2b reported higher fatigue and dizziness at weeks 12 (p < 0.05) and 24 (p < 0.05), and irritability and memory loss at week 24 (p < 0.05) with respect to Peg-IFN alpha-2a Group. At week 12, role functioning, general health perception, vitality, emotional role, mental health and the summary areas of physical health and mental health were lower in Peg-IFN alpha-2b Group (p < 0.05). The same was observed in physical functioning (p = 0.05) and role functioning, general health perception, emotional role and mental health (p < 0.001) at week 24. Three months after finishing treatment, no patient had depressive or neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life improved. Antiretroviral adherence was low but adherence to anti-HCV therapy remained high in both groups. According to our data, Peg-IFN alpha-2a and Peg-IFN alpha-2b exert a similar impact on the overall rate of depressive symptoms, although patients treated with Peg-IFN alpha-2a experience less fatigue and fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms and a lower impairment in their physical and mental quality of life."
6378,0.005,1.0000,"In chronic hepatitis C (CHC), treatment duration may be individualized according to time to first undetectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, with patients who attain undetectable HCV RNA early in treatment being candidates for shorter regimens. The aim of this study was to determine the relapse rate in patients with CHC genotype (G) 1 infection and low baseline viral load who achieved undetectable HCV RNA by week 4 [rapid virologic response (RVR)] when treated for 24 weeks. This was an open-label, multicentre, noninterventional study. Adult patients with G1 CHC infection and baseline viral load <600,000 IU/mL who attained RVR were treated with peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 μg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800-1200 mg/day) for 24 weeks, then followed for a further 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was relapse rate, defined as the proportion of patients with undetectable HCV RNA at treatment week 24 and detectable HCV RNA at week 24 follow-up. The secondary efficacy endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR). Overall, 170 patients were included in the efficacy-evaluable population. The relapse rate was 9.7% (16/165, 95% confidence interval: 0.06-0.15), and SVR was attained by 149 of 170 patients (87.6%). Virologic outcomes were consistent regardless of age, gender, body weight and genotype. Seven patients reported treatment-emergent serious adverse events (AEs), and four patients discontinued treatment because of an AE. This study further demonstrates that peginterferon alfa-2b plus weight-based ribavirin for 24 weeks is an effective treatment strategy for treatment-naive patients with G1 CHC and low viral load who attain RVR."
3904,0.005,1.0000,"Access to free antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Sub-Saharan Africa has been steadily increasing over the past decade. However, the success of large-scale ART programmes depends on timely diagnosis and early initiation of HIV care. This study characterizes late presenters to HIV care in Santiago (Cape Verde) between 2004 and 2011, and identifies factors associated with late presentation for care. We defined late presentation as persons presenting to HIV care with a CD4 count below 350 cells/mm³. An unmatched case-control study was conducted using socio-demographic and behavioural data of 368 individuals (191 cases and 177 controls) collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire, comparing HIV patients late and early presented to care. Logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Results show that 51.9% were late presenters for HIV. No differences were found in gender distribution, marital status, or access to health services between cases and controls. Participants who undertook an HIV test by doctor indication were more likely to present late compared with those who tested for HIV by their own initiative. Also, individuals taking less time to initiate ART are more likely to present late. This study highlights the need to better understand reasons for late presentation to HIV care in Cape Verde. People in older age groups should be targeted in future approaches focused on late presenters to HIV care."
6686,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) alpha-2a monotherapy in a cohort of Chinese haemophilic patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) and undergoing highly active antiretroviral drugs therapy. Twenty-two (n = 22) patients with CD4 lymphocyte counts over 200 cells microL(-1) were treated with 180 microg of PEG-IFN alpha-2a subcutaneously once in a week for 48 weeks. HCV load (HCV RNA), HIV load (HIV RNA) and CD4 lymphocyte counts were measured at baseline and 4, 12, 24, 48 and 72 weeks after initiation of anti-HCV therapy. Efficacy and safety were analysed according to baseline CD4 status (> or =350 cells microL(-1)). Significant HCV-RNA decreases (>1 log(10) copies mL(-1)) were observed through week 72 after PEG-INF alpha-2a monotherapy across both CD4 strata. CD4 status was not associated with treatment outcomes as evaluated using rapid viral response rate (P = 0.655), early viral response rate (P = 0.387), end-of-treatment viral response rate (P = 1.000) or sustained viral response rate (SVR, P = 0.674). A sustained virological response was achieved in nine patients (41%), five with genotype 2a (83%) and four with genotype 1b (25%, P = 0.023). SVR was HCV genotype dependent. Eleven patients required a dose reduction in PEG-IFN alpha-2a. PEG-IFN alpha-2a monotherapy could be considered as a safe and effective option for the treatment of HCV infection in HIV patients with haemophilia, particularly in resource-limited settings. While higher CD4 lymphocyte counts resulted in greater HCV-RNA reduction, HCV genotype was a predictor for sustained virological response."
18488,0.005,1.0000,"We studied all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with invasive pneumococcal disease who received their diagnosis during 1996-2002 to investigate the incidence of this disease in the highly active antiretroviral therapy era and to study the influence of CD4 lymphocyte count on the clinical presentation and outcome of disease. The overall incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease was 11.3 cases per 100,000 person-years in adult patients without known HIV infection and 677 cases per 100,000 person-years in HIV-infected patients. This incidence remained stable over the study period. Clinical presentation, severity of illness, and number of recurrent episodes were similar in patients with CD4+ cell counts of >200 or < or =200 cells/ microL. Patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) were more likely to present with TMP-SMZ-resistant pneumococci than were those who were not receiving this agent (76.7% vs. 43.6%; P=.007). The mortality rate was high (21%)."
7925,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity has historically been an absolute contraindication for solid organ transplantation. However, the successful application of HAART (highly active anti-retroviral therapy) drug regimens has greatly prolonged the life expectancy of HIV-positive patients. Therefore, it has become appropriate to consider this patient population for transplantation. HIV positive transplants are being performed around the country in controlled settings, usually as part of a research protocol. The aim of our study is to describe the Louisiana experience with organ transplantation into HIV-positive patients. We identified seven HIV-positive patients who underwent kidney or kidney/pancreas transplantation at our center between 2007 and 2010. We performed a retrospective chart review to ascertain graft function, as well as virologic and immunologic status post-transplant. Renal function (glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine concentrations) improved in all subjects post-transplant, and six of seven (85.8%) subjects remained virologically suppressed with no progression to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Overall, two-year graft and patient survival rates were 85.5%. HIV seropositive End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients represent a new population of patients that can be successfully transplanted. This offers a new dimension in care for successful HAART therapy to prolong the life of HIV-infected patients."
15895,0.005,1.0000,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). During 2004, Guyana had an estimated TB incidence rate of 140 per 100,000 population, the fourth highest rate in the Americas (after Haiti, Bolivia, and Peru); Guyana also had an estimated adult HIV prevalence of 2.5%, and 20% of TB patients were reported to be infected with HIV. In 2000, the Guyana Ministry of Health (MOH) began providing HIV counseling, testing, and referrals to HIV/AIDS programs at its six public chest clinics. At the end of 2005, chest clinics also began providing co-trimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) to HIV-infected TB patients as a measure against common opportunistic infections. During February-June 2006, an international team assessed the extent to which MOH chest clinics in Guyana had implemented these interventions during July 2005-June 2006. This report summarizes the results of that assessment, which determined that, among 253 TB patients sampled, 174 (69%) initially did not know their HIV-infection status; 127 (73%) of those patients were offered HIV counseling and testing, and 115 (91%) accepted and were tested for HIV. Of the 115 who were tested, 11 (10%) were determined to be HIV infected; overall, 68 (35%) of the 194 patients whose HIV-infection status was known were HIV infected (i.e., 11 who were tested at the chest clinics plus 57 with preexisting knowledge of their HIV status). These results indicate both a high rate of HIV infection among TB patients in Guyana and the ability of chest clinics to provide HIV-related interventions in resource-limited settings."
12672,0.005,1.0000,"The free antiretroviral therapy (ART) program in India has scaled up to register second largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS across the globe. To assess the effectiveness of current first-line regimen we estimated virological suppression on completion of 1 year of ART. The study describes the correlates of virological failure (VF) and multinucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) drug resistance mutations (DRMs).In this cross-sectional study conducted between June and August 2014, consecutive adults from 4 State sponsored ART clinics of western India were recruited for plasma viral load screening at 12 ± 2 months of ART initiation. Individuals with plasma viral load >1000 copies/mL were selected for HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) genotyping. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with VF and multi-NRTI resistance mutations. Criteria adopted for multi-NRTI resistance mutation were either presence of K65R or 3 or more thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) or presence of M184V along with 2 TAMs.Of the 844 study participants, virological suppression at 1 year was achieved in 87.7% of individuals. Factors significantly associated with VF (P < 0.005) were 12 months CD4 count of ≤100 cells/μL (adjusted OR -7.11), low reported adherence (adjusted OR -4.44), and those living without any partner (adjusted OR -1.98). In patients with VF, the prevalence of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) DRM (78.75%) were higher as compared to NRTI (58.75%). Multi-NRTI DRMs were present in 32.5% of sequences and were significantly associated with CD4 count of ≤100 cells/μL at baseline (adjusted OR -13.00) and TDF-based failing regimen (adjusted OR -20.43). Additionally, low reported adherence was negatively associated with multi-NRTI resistance (adjusted OR -0.11, P = 0.015). K65R mutation was significantly associated with tenofovir (TDF)-based failing regimen (P < 0.001).The study supports early linkage of HIV-infected individuals to the program for ART initiation, adherence improvement, and introduction of viral load monitoring. With recent introduction of TDF-based regimen, the emergence of K65R needs to be monitored closely among HIV-1 subtype C-infected Indian population. "

In this paper, we report results of an investigation of drug use and sexual behavior associated with HTLV-I infection among male and female injecting drug users (IDUs) in Salvador. A cross sectional study was conducted in the Historical District of Salvador from 1994-1996 (Projeto Brasil-Salvador) and 216 asymptomatic IDUs were selected using the snowball contact technique. Blood samples were collected for serological assays. Sera were screened for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1/2) and HTLV-I/II antibodies by ELISA and confirmed by Western blot. The overall prevalence of HTLV-I/II was 35.2% (76/216). The seroprevalence of HTLV-I, HTLV-II and HIV-I was for males 22%, 11.3% and 44.1% and for females 46.2%, 10.3% and 74.4% respectively. HTLV-I was identified in 72.4% of HTLV positive IDUs. Variables which were significantly associated with HTLV-I infection among males included needle sharing practices, duration of injecting drug use, HIV-I seropositivity and syphilis. Among women, duration of injecting drug use and syphilis were strongly associated with HTLV-I infection. Multivariate analysis did not change the direction of these associations. Sexual intercourse might play a more important role in HTLV-I infection among women than in men."
13274,0.005,1.0000,"We analyzed the deaths in an outpatient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care clinic at University Hospitals in Cleveland from January 1995 through December 1999. The number of annual deaths decreased progressively, from 112 in 1995 to 32 in 1999. The median final CD4(+) cell count before death increased progressively from 10 cells/microL in 1995 to 90 cells/microL in 1999 (P<.01); 20%--25% of patients who died from 1997 through 1999 had plasma HIV RNA levels below detection limits. From 1995 through 1998, deaths due to infection, to end-stage acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and to malignancies decreased, whereas the proportion of deaths due to end-organ failures and of uncertain relationship to HIV infection increased. The spectrum of mortality in HIV disease has changed recently; although opportunistic infections cause death less frequently, deaths are occurring in people who have control of HIV replication and with some preservation of immune function. These observations underscore the need to monitor the etiologies of HIV-associated mortality and to better our understanding of the relationships among immune defenses, treatment-related toxicities, and end-organ failure in patients with HIV disease."
2972,0.005,1.0000,"During the course of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) disease, the virus has been shown to effectively escape the immune response with the subsequent establishment of latent viral reservoirs in specific cell populations within the peripheral blood (PB) and associated lymphoid tissues, bone marrow (BM), brain, and potentially other end organs. HIV-1, along with hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV), are known to share similar routes of transmission, including intravenous drug use, blood transfusions, sexual intercourse, and perinatal exposure. Substance abuse, including the use of opioids and cocaine, is a significant risk factor for exposure to HIV-1 and the development of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, as well as HBV and HCV exposure, infection, and disease. Thus, coinfection with HIV-1 and HBV or HCV is common and may be impacted by chronic substance abuse during the course of disease. HIV- 1 impacts the natural course of HBV and HCV infection by accelerating the progression of HBV/HCV-associated liver disease toward end-stage cirrhosis and quantitative depletion of the CD4+ T-cell compartment. HBV or HCV coinfection with HIV-1 is also associated with increased mortality when compared to either infection alone. This review focuses on the impact of substance abuse and coinfection with HBV and HCV in the PB, BM, and brain on the HIV-1 pathogenic process as it relates to viral pathogenesis, disease progression, and the associated immune response during the course of this complex interplay. The impact of HIV-1 and substance abuse on hepatitis virus-induced disease is also a focal point."
6189,0.005,1.0000,"Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) reduces morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but it may also alter the clinical course of subclinical opportunistic infections and can even induce autoimmune disease. These atypical presentations are known as immune restoration disease (IRD), immune reconstitution syndrome/immune recovery syndrome (IRS), or immune restoration inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). We report the case of a 27-year-old, HIV-1-positive woman who developed hyperthyroidism attributable to Graves' disease (GD) after commencing potent cART. At the initiation of cART, her CD4 T cell count was 15 cells/microL and plasma HIV RNA 35 000 copies/mL. Her commencement of cART resulted in complete viral suppression and subsequent improvement of the CD4 T-cell count. Three years later, the diagnosis of GD was established based on a typical clinical picture and the results of hormonal and immunological analyses. It coincided with a 58-fold rise of the CD4 T cells. Retrospective analysis of serum samples revealed normal thyroid function and lack of anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO), anti- thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (anti-TSHR), and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) autoantibodies at the beginning of cART. HLA class II gene examination did not reveal susceptibility for the GD development in this patient. We suggest that GD in our patient was an IRD, and advise this as a possible differential diagnosis in patients presenting with hyperthyroidism on cART. To provide further details relevant to this case, we also review the literature concerning IRD-GD."
17137,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes systemic T cell destruction and reduced cell-mediated immunity that leads to a wide range of opportunistic infections and cancers. Second, it directly damages many tissues - gut, brain, lung - through mononuclear cell infection and activation. Third, through immune activation and effects on endothelia, it can cause more subtle systemic organ damage, such as chronic cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary and central nervous system disease. Antiretroviral treatment has enabled HIV-infected persons to live with chronic infection, although with some side-effects and mortality, including reactions due to the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). As cohorts of infected people get older, age-related diseases will combine with chronic HIV infection to produce disabilities whose scale is not yet understood. HIV is detectable in tissues by immunohistochemistry when infection loads are high, such as at first presentation. Pathologists should proactively consider HIV disease in routine diagnostic work, so as to identify more HIV-infected patients and enable their optimal management."
1184,0.005,1.0000,"Zinc deficiency is the most prevalent micronutrient abnormality seen in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Low levels of plasma zinc predict a 3-fold increase in HIV-related mortality, whereas normalization has been associated with significantly slower disease progression and a decrease in the rate of opportunistic infections. Studies in Miami, Florida, indicated that HIV-positive users of illicit drugs are at risk for developing zinc deficiency, at least partially because of their poor dietary intake. Zinc deficiency characterized by low plasma zinc levels over time enhances HIV-associated disease progression, and low dietary zinc intake is an independent predictor of mortality in HIV-infected drug users. The amount of zinc supplementation in HIV infection appears to be critical, because deficiency, as well as excessive dietary intake of zinc, has been linked with declining CD4 cell counts and reduced survival. More research is needed to determine the optimal zinc supplementation level in HIV-infected patients, to prevent further burden on an already compromised immune system."

After adjustment for other parameters, baseline HIV RNA level was significantly associated with baseline clinical stage and CD4 cell count. During follow-up (mean, 14.6 months), 16 patients died; 34 others had clinical progression of disease. In multivariate analysis, mortality was better predicted by baseline CD4 cell count (relative hazard [RH] for 100-cell decrease, 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-8.2; P = .003) than by HIV RNA (P = .28) or clinical stage. HIV RNA level was the best predictor of clinical progression (RH for 1 log increase, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.6-4.9; P < .001).

The presence of SI virus was assessed in 325 persons entering 11 antiretroviral therapy trials and correlated with both CD4 cell declines and clinical end points. Adjusted mean rates of CD4 cell count decline were 40 and 102 cells/year in the non-SI (NSI) and SI groups, respectively (P < .0001). Rates of decline in 16 persons converting from NSI to SI virus averaged 31 cells/year before conversion and 142 cells/year afterward (P = .04). In a nested case-control analysis, persons who experienced surrogate marker end points or opportunistic infections were 2.3-3.5 times more likely to have SI virus than were controls (P = .01-.04) but who died were similar to controls with respect to virus phenotype (P = .70). Presence of the SI phenotype of HIV is a strong predictor of decline in CD4 cell count and progression of disease; however, controlling for the CD4 cell count, the SI phenotype did not increase the immediate risk of death."
8615,0.005,1.0000,"Self-efficacy is associated with health behavior and medication adherence in persons living with HIV infection (PLWH). This paper describes self-efficacy, medication adherence, and quality of life (QOL), and it examines the relationships among these variables in PLWH in China. A cross-sectional survey of 199 patients was completed using the HIV Self-Efficacy Questionnaire and the QOL for Chinese HIV-Infected Questionnaire. Medication adherence was measured through direct questioning of pill-taking behavior. Results showed that self-efficacy for disease management was moderate, with a mean score of 6.61. Of the 199 patients, 157 (78.9%) reported that medication adherence was higher than 90%. The scores for dimensions of QOL ranged from 33.1 to 81.4, with six dimensions lower than 60. Stepwise regression analyses showed that self-efficacy, medication adherence, and drug use were significant predictors of QOL. These results suggest a need for intervention programs to improve self-efficacy and quality of life in Chinese PLWH."
11677,0.005,1.0000,"One hundred and ninety-three adults with HIV taking antiretroviral therapy completed a questionnaire on demographics, health beliefs, medication side-effects, and adherence to dose, schedule, and dietary instructions. Three health beliefs indices were identified: antiretroviral therapy (ART) benefits, ART adherence self-efficacy, and beliefs about future HIV-related health concerns. Patients who experienced medication side-effects reported strong beliefs that HIV infection would cause them future health problems or distrust in the benefits of ART. AIDS diagnosis obtained through medical records or medication side-effects were not related to any of the three types of adherence. Beliefs about future HIV-related health concerns were associated with suboptimal dose adherence. Beliefs about ART benefits were associated with suboptimal schedule and dietary instructions adherence. Older age and partner were protective factors of schedule adherence. Data suggest that health beliefs may vary across type of adherence and that adherence behaviours may be a coping strategy to adjust antiretroviral therapy to one's daily living."

To explore whether treatment history could affect QOL, we examined patients with detectable HCV viraemia who had a different therapeutic background. Two hundred sixty-four consecutive subjects with chronic HCV infection and detectable viraemia were enrolled. Of these, 163 were untreated patients, 43 were relapsers, 58 were nonresponders (NR) to nonpegylated interferon (IFN) therapy. To assess QOL, three self-report instruments were employed: the Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ-I) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment (WHOQOL-BREF). Clinical and demographic data were collected, and the QOL scores of HCV-positive patients were compared with those of an Italian normative sample and healthy controls. Further antiviral treatment was offered to untreated and relapsed patients but not to NR. All patient groups displayed lower QOL scores compared with the normative sample and controls. NR displayed lower QOL scores in several areas compared with untreated patients and relapsers. In multivariate regression analyses, being NR and having a physical comorbidity were significantly associated with poorer QOL."
10302,0.005,1.0000,"A high level of adherence to antiretroviral treatment is essential for optimal clinical outcomes in HIV infection, but measuring adherence is difficult. We investigated whether responses to a questionnaire eliciting caregiver beliefs in medicines were associated with adherence of their child (median age 2.8 years), and whether this in turn was associated with viral suppression. We used the validated beliefs in medicine questionnaire (BMQ) to measure caregiver beliefs, and medication event monitoring system caps to measure adherence. We found significant associations between BMQ scores and adherence, and between adherence and viral suppression. Among children initiating Antiretroviral therapy (ART), we also found significant associations between BMQ 'necessity' scores, and BMQ 'necessity-concerns' scores, and later viral suppression. This suggests that the BMQ may be a valuable tool when used alongside other adherence measures, and that it remains important to keep caregivers well informed about the long-term necessity of their child's ART."
17901,0.005,1.0000,"We investigated risk factors for unfavorable virologic responses among HIV-infected patients who recently switched antiretroviral regimens. We identified HIV-infected patients who switched antiretroviral regimens (defined as adding ≥2 new medications) between 2001 and 2008 at Kaiser Permanente California. Virological response, measured after 6 months on the new regimen, was classified as (1) maximal viral suppression (HIV RNA <75/ml), (2) low-level viremia (LLV; 75-5000/ml), or (3) advanced virologic failure (>5000/ml). Potential risk factors examined included (1) HIV disease factors, e.g., prior AIDS, CD4 cell count; (2) history of antiretroviral use, e.g., therapy classes of the newly switched regimen, medication adherence, and virologic failure at previous regimens; and (3) novel patient-level factors including comorbidities and healthcare utilization. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for LLV and advanced virologic failure were obtained from multivariable nominal logistic regression models. A total of 3447 patients were included; 2608 (76%) achieved maximal viral suppression, 420 (12%) had LLV, and 419 (12%) developed advanced virologic failure. Factors positively associated with LLV and advanced virologic failure included number of regimens prior to switch [aOR(per regimen)=1.38 (1.17-1.62) and 1.77 (1.50-2.08), respectively], nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor-only regimens (vs. protease inhibitor-based) [aOR=2.78 (1.28-6.04) and 5.10 (2.38-10.90), respectively], and virologic failure at previous regimens [aOR=3.15 (2.17-4.57) and 4.71 (2.84-7.81), respectively]. Older age, higher CD4 cell count, and medication adherence were protective for unfavorable virologic outcomes. Antiretroviral regimen-level factors and immunodeficiency were significantly associated with virologic failure after a recent therapy switch and should be considered when making treatment change decisions."
15940,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus infection causes a severe depletion of TCD4+ lymphocytes and a sustained immune activation state, hallmarks findings that led to numerical and phenotypic changes in the TCD4+ subsets. Highly active anti-retroviral therapy has substantially modified the course of HIV infection. Correct adherence to the treatment results in a decrease in viral load at undetectable levels and a significant increase in the number of peripheral T cell lymphocytes. In the present study association between changes in T cell subsets and treatment adherence was evaluated in 28 HIV (+) infected children, before and after 9 months on average, from starting anti-retroviral therapy. The group of 18 patients with good adherence, above 95%, showed a significant increase in CD4+CD45RA+CD62L+ naive cells percentual levels and a decrease in the CD4+CD45RA-CD62L+ central memory subset, between the two points of the follow-up period. Conversely, 10 children with failure in the adherence did not show significant differences in the percentual levels of both subsets. Improvement in the percentage of adherence among paediatric population, optimizing antiretroviral treatment, allows a quick and significant reduction of viral replication. This feature is associated with the progressive reconstitution of the immune system. "
16565,0.005,1.0000,"Knowledge of factors associated with medication adherence could help HIV clinicians to target persons in need of intervention, design these interventions, and help researchers to plan studies of adherence. This review summarizes the results of 20 studies investigating the issue of barriers to optimal highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence. Only a few determinants were consistently associated with nonadherence. Symptoms and adverse drug effects, psychologic distress, lack of social or family support, complexity of the HAART regimen, low patient self-efficacy, and inconvenience of treatment were the factors most consistently associated with nonadherence. There were inconsistent findings regarding the relationship of adherence and the following variables: sociodemographic characteristics, substance abuse, depressive symptoms, quality of life, CD4+ cell count, knowledge and beliefs about treatment, patients' satisfaction with health care, and patient-provider relationship. A synthesis of findings relating various factors to adherence to HAART is difficult to reach because of several limitations of the existing body of research. These limitations concern the measurement of adherence, the assessment of correlates and predictors of adherence, the study population, and the study design."

A cross-sectional study was conducted at two major sexual health clinics in high HIV prevalence provinces in the Highlands Region of PNG to assess ART adherence, factors affecting adherence and the relationship between ART adherence and virological outcomes. Ninety-five HIV+ individuals were recruited and administered a questionnaire to gather demographic and ART adherence information whilst clinical data and pill counts were extracted from patient charts and blood was collected for viral load testing. Bivariate analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of ART adherence. Fourteen percent (n = 12) of participants showed evidence of virological failure. Although the majority of participants self-reported excellent ART adherence in the last seven days (78.9%, 75/91), pill count measurements indicated only 40% (34/84) with >95% adherence in the last month. Taking other medications while on ART (p = 0.01) and taking ART for ≥1 year (p = 0.037) were positively associated with adherence by self-report and pill count, respectively. Participants who had never heard of drug resistance were more likely to show virological failure (p = 0.033). Misconception on routes of HIV transmission still persists in the studied population. These findings indicate that non-adherence to ART is high in this region of PNG and continued education and strategies to improve adherence are required to ensure the efficacy of ART and prevent HIV drug resistance.

16008,0.005,1.0000,"Use of alcohol and illicit drugs is a common finding among HIV-infected individuals, but there are many open questions about its impact on adherence to antiretroviral therapy and virological outcomes. Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of the use of alcohol and illicit drugs on the adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among patients starting ART in Salvador, Brazil. We followed up 144 AIDS patients initiating ART for a 6-month period. At baseline, they were interviewed about demographics, behavior, and use of illicit drugs and alcohol. All of them had HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load and CD4(+)/CD8(+) cells count measured before starting therapy. After 60 days of treatment they were asked to answer a new questionnaire on adherence to ART. All patients were monitored during the following months, and new CD4(+) cell count/HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load determinations were performed after 6 months of therapy. Optimal adherence to therapy was defined by self-reported questionnaire, by 95% use of prescribed drug doses, and by using plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load as a biological marker. A total of 61 (42.4%) patients reported alcohol use, 7 (4.9%) used illicit drugs, and 17 (11.8%) used both alcohol and illicit drugs. Being in a steady relationship was protective to nonadherence (95% CI: 0.18-0.84). Missing more than two medical visits was also associated with a 68% higher likelihood of nonadherence (95% CI: 0.10-1.02). After logistic regression we detected a higher risk of nonadherence for patients declaring use of alcohol plus illicit drugs (odds ratio=6.0; 95% CI: 1.78-20.28) or high-intensity use of alcohol (odds ratio=3.29; 95% CI: 1.83-5.92). AIDS patients using alcohol and/or illicit drugs are socially vulnerable, and need specific and flexible programs, combining mental health care, harm reduction strategies, and assisted drug therapy to maximize the chances of successful use of ART."
9769,0.005,1.0000,"Kidneys from organ donors who have behaviors that place them at increased risk for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) are often discarded, even if viral screening tests are negative. This study compared policies that would either 'Discard' or 'Transplant' kidneys from Centers for Disease Control classified increased-risk donors (CDC-IRDs) using a decision analytic Markov model of renal failure treatment modalities. Base-case CDC-IRDs were current injection drug users (IDUs) with negative antibody and nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HIV and HCV, comprising 5% of kidney donors. Compared to a CDC-IRD kidney 'Discard' policy, the 'Transplant' policy resulted in higher patient survival, a greater number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (5.6 vs. 5.1 years per patient), more kidney transplants (990 vs. 740 transplants per 1000 patients) and lower cost of care ($60 000 vs. $71 000 per QALY). The total number of viral infections was lower with the 'Transplant' policy (13.1 vs. 14.8 infections per 1000 patients over 20 years), because the 'Discard' policy led to more time on hemodialysis, with a higher HCV incidence. We recommend that kidneys from NAT-negative CDC-IRDs be considered for transplantation since the practice is estimated to be beneficial from both the societal and individual patient perspective."
10899,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C aims to achieve viral eradication. Decreasing the number of carriers subsequently reduces the transmission of the viruses. For an individual patient, therapy is aimed at preventing cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocarcinoma. Among potential therapies, interferon alfa offers the best results. In one study involving the treatment of children from a region of intermediate endemicity, interferon alfa accelerated the clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. In long-term follow-up, the study did not show a significant difference between patients who were treated and those who were not in the rate of disappearance of serum HBV-DNA, normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels or seroconversion to antibodies to hepatitis B e antigen. The most important factors in predicting a rapid decrease in HBV replication were AI T levels more than twice normal, low levels of serum HBV-DNA (less than 100 pg/mL) and inflammatory activity on liver biopsy (chronic active hepatitis). A select group of children with HBV infection has thus been shown to benefit from interferon alfa therapy. Treatment should be administered in a dosage of 6 MU/m2 three times each week for 6 months. Chronic active hepatitis, develops in approximately 30% of children with a chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Cirrhosis due to HCV appears to be a very rare complication among children. Results of interferon alfa treatment for children with HCV are scarce. A pilot study of 12 children treated with interferon alfa in a dosage of 3 MU/m2 three times each week for 6 months showed that ALT levels normalized in approximately 90% of the patients after 15 months of follow-up. All of the patients had a decrease in the histological activity of the disease. Factors predictive of a favourable response in adults were: low levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase, young age, female sex, short duration of disease, absence of cirrhosis and low histological activity of the disease. Controlled randomized studies are needed to determine the indications for interferon alfa therapy in children infected with HCV. Available data suggest that children may have a better response than adults."
16092,0.005,1.0000,"Current agents for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can be classified into interferon-α (standard or pegylated) (IFN) and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs). IFN therapy has the advantage of a finite duration (48 weeks) with a chance for durable sustained off-treatment response in HBeAg positive CHB patients. However, these benefits are limited to approximately 30% of HBeAg positive patients, while parenteral administration and potential side effects are common patient concerns. Thus, patients who can benefit from IFN therapy must be carefully selected and monitored. Recently, stopping rules for IFN non-responders were developed based on 12-week HBsAg levels. NAs are currently used in most CHB patients. They are administered in one tablet daily and can be used in all patients with excellent tolerability and a good safety profile. The current first-line options, entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir (TDF), are highly potent with a minimal risk of resistance during long-term monotherapy. Prolongation of entecavir or tenofovir maintains the initially high virological remission rates in adherent HBeAg positive patients and modifies the long-term outcomes. The need for a long-term, perhaps indefinite, treatment duration is the main limitation of ETV or TDF, which may sometimes be safely discontinued in HBeAg positive patients who achieve stable HBeAg seroconversion. Since there will always be safety concerns and family planning issues with long-term therapy, NAs should be used carefully particularly in young HBeAg positive patients with minimal-mild liver disease."
13160,0.005,1.0000,"Despite the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-infected drug users, particularly crack cocaine users, continue to have high HIV-related morbidity and mortality. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline data for hospitalized HIV-infected crack cocaine users recruited for Project HOPE (Hospital Visit Is an Opportunity for Prevention and Engagement with HIV-Positive Crack Users) in Atlanta and Miami who were eligible for ART (reported any lifetime use of ART or CD4 <350 cells/μl). Among 350 eligible participants, whose mean age was 44.9 years (SD 7.0), 49% were male, 90% were black, and 81% were heterosexual. The median CD4 count was 144 cells/μl, and 78 of 350 (22%) were taking ART. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression to examine individual, interpersonal, and structural factors as potential correlates of ART use. Reporting ≥2 visits to outpatient HIV care in the past 6 months (AOR 7.55, 95% CI 3.80-14.99), drug or alcohol treatment in the past 6 months (AOR 2.29, 95% CI 1.06-4.94), and study site being Miami (AOR 2.99, 95% CI 1.56-5.73) were associated with ART use. Current homelessness (AOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20-0.84) and CD4 <200 cells/μl (AOR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15-0.55) were negatively associated with ART use. Among those taking ART, 60% had an HIV-1 viral load <400 copies/ml; this represented 9% of the eligible population. For HIV-infected crack cocaine users, structural factors may be as important as individual and interpersonal factors in facilitating ART utilization. Few HIV(+) crack cocaine users had viral suppression, but among those on ART, viral suppression was achievable."
19305,0.005,1.0000,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular  diseases partly due to chronic inflammation. Some antiretroviral  drugs and Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) regimens seem to be related and amplify this increased risk, especially the ones containing abacavir. Platelet-Activating-Factor (PAF) is a potent inflammatory mediator that is implicated in both cardiovascular diseases and HIV-related manifestations. Our objective is to study the in vivo effect of the abacavir/lamivudine/efavirenz first-line HAART regimen on PAF metabolism in HIV-infected patients. The specific activities of PAF basic biosynthetic enzymes in leukocytes and platelets, PAF-cholinephosphotransferase  (PAF-CPT) and lyso-PAF-acetyltransferase (Lyso-PAF-AT), but also those of PAF-basic catabolic enzymes, PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) in leukocytes and platelets and Lipoprotein-associated-Phospholipase-A2 (LpPLA2) in plasma, were measured in blood samples of 10 asymptomatic naïve male HIV-infected patients just before and after 1, 3 and 6 months of treatment. CD4 cell counts, viral load and several biochemical markers were also measured in the same blood samples of these patients. The repeated ANOVA measures and the Pearson r criterion were used for studying statistical differences and correlations - partial correlations respectively. Even though viral load was decreased and CD4 cell counts were beneficially increased after treatment with the abacavir/lamivudine/efavirenz regimen, the main enzyme of the remodelling PAF-synthesis that is implicated in pro-atherogenic inflammatory procedures, Lyso-PAF-AT activity, was increased at 3 months of treatment in both leukocytes and platelets, while the main enzyme of PAF-degradation, PAF-AH, was increased as a response only in leukocytes at the 3rd month. Although the  abacavir/lamivudine/efavirenz HAART regimen exhibits very efficient antiretroviral activities, on the other hand it induces an in vivo transient increase in the inflammation-related remodeling PAF-biosynthetic pathway. This finding supports the hypothesis of inflammation-mediated increased cardiovascular risk in HIV-infected patients during the first months of abacavir-containing HAART."
10466,0.005,1.0000,"The molecular mechanism(s) by which human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) injures a T-cell line was studied. A pathological role for viral env proteins, which are inserted into the plasma membrane, has been previously demonstrated for HIV as well as other retroviruses which are cytopathic. We therefore initiated studies examining whether perturbations of the cell membrane or membrane-associated biochemical events may be occurring in cells acutely infected with HIV and whether such perturbations, if present, may be responsible for cytopathology. A human T-cell line (ERIC), which is sensitive to the cytopathic effects of HIVs, was infected with HTLV-IIIB and its membrane permeability to cations and its lipid metabolism were studied coincident with the peak expression of viral p24 and with the first sign of cytopathology (slowing of cell division) 72 to 96 hr after infection. It was found that the rate of influx of Ca2+ into the cell increased over that of uninfected cells and that phospholipid synthesis, primarily phosphatidylcholine, became depressed. Diacylglycerol, which serves both as an intermediate for synthesis of phospholipids and as a second-messenger for lymphocyte activation, was also greatly reduced. However, triglyceride synthesis was enhanced, indicating that not all lipid metabolic pathways were being shut down. This decreased membrane-synthetic ability and reduced second-messenger for cell division are likely to be important causes of HIV-1 cytopathology in ERIC cells. This hypothesis was supported by our finding that HIV cytopathology of ERIC cells could be partially prevented by treatment with compounds (diacylglyceride or PMA and transiently by oleic acid) which either replenish diacylglycerol in the infected cell and/or activate protein kinase C or phosphocholine cytidyltransferase, the latter being the rate-limiting step in synthesis of the major structural phospholipid in most cells."
16349,0.005,1.0000,"Initially recognized in 1982, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been the leading cause of death among young adults in the United States for much of this decade, and it has had a devastating impact on people in the developing world. It is estimated that 42 million people worldwide have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS, and that almost 12 million people have died from AIDS-related diseases through 1997. Among these 12 million are 3 million children. Two thirds of the more than 30 million people with HIV or AIDS reside in sub-Saharan Africa. In the United States, 641,086 patients have been diagnosed with AIDS through 1997, and at least 385,000 have died. However, for the first time, new highly active antiretroviral therapies that include multiple drugs that attack the virus at several sites have slowed the progression from HIV to AIDS and from AIDS to death for those infected with HIV. The cumulative effect of these changes has been a reduction in both AIDS incident cases and AIDS deaths. Recent epidemiologic trends indicate that the proportion of AIDS incident cases and new HIV infections are increasing among women, African-Americans, and Hispanics, and the infections are more likely to be acquired through heterosexual transmission. The clinical management of HIV infection and AIDS has become increasingly complex in recent years. In addition to complete medical and social histories and physical examinations, hematologic, biochemical, serologic, and immunologic laboratory tests are required to predict the likelihood that patients will develop opportunistic infections and other complications related to HIV infection. Among the most important laboratory tests are measurements of HIV in plasma (viral load) in conjunction with peripheral blood CD4+ helper T lymphocyte counts. These tests are potent predictors of disease progression and their results have become markers for clinical response to therapy. The development of highly active antiretroviral therapy has had a profound impact on the epidemiology of AIDS and on the lives of individual patients. Through combinations of antiretroviral drugs, especially protease inhibitors, viral suppression can be achieved. However, adherence to these complex medical regimens and drug interactions have been problems for many patients. In addition, numerous questions remain unanswered, most importantly those regarding the timing of the initiation of treatment, the durability of viral suppression and clinical response, and the optimal ""salvage"" regimens for patients failing therapy either clinically or virologically."
14046,0.005,1.0000,"T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) may be a useful surrogate marker in HIV-1 infection for evaluating the likelihood of continued clinical stability and/or the response to therapeutics, including vaccines. Analysis of TREC in SHIV and SIV models of HIV-1 infection may provide additional information concerning the utility of TREC as a marker. We measured TREC in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from rhesus macaques in SHIV89.6p (n = 20) and SIVmac251 (n = 11) models of HIV-1 infection. TREC were also evaluated in tissues in the SIVmac251 model at end-point. In the SHIV89.6p model, TREC in PBMC were significantly lower at 12 weeks postinfection compared to preinfection levels. The decrease in TREC correlated with the decline in CD4+ T cells (r(s) = 0.496; P = 0.026), which in turn correlated inversely with serum viral loads at end-point (r(s) = -0.517; P = 0.019). Macaques that controlled SHIV89.6p infection to some degree (n = 6) had higher TREC at study end-point (P = 0.017). In the SIVmac251 model, TREC in PBMC were significantly reduced after 17 months of infection (P = 0.012) despite receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) consisting of didanosine (ddI) and (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)-adenine (PMPA) when not cycling off therapy during scheduled treatment interruptions (STI). However, macaques that received continuous hydroxyurea (HU) in addition to the HAART regimen had higher end-point TREC compared to the non-HU group (P = 0.041), and the reduction in TREC observed at end-point within the HU group was not significant. In the SIVmac251 model, TREC correlated with the percentage of CD4+ T cells (r(s) = 0.426; P = 0.048) and CD4+CD28+ T cells (r(s) = 0.624; P = 0.002), and inversely with CD8+ T cells (r(s) = -0.622; P = 0.002), CD8+CD28- T cells (r(s) = -0.516; P = 0.014), and serum viral loads (r(s) = -0.627; P = 0.039). High levels of TREC were observed in the thymus, levels comparable to PBMC were seen in the lymph node, and low but detectable levels of TREC were present in bone marrow. The use of correlates of TREC as covariates in ANCOVA revealed that the decline in TREC in the SHIV 89.6p model reflected the decline in the percentage of CD4+ T-cells due to viral cytopathogenicity. In the SIVmac251 model, the decline in TREC was related to increased immune activation and proliferation due to viral replication, as reflected by decreases in percentages of CD4+CD28+ T cells and increases in CD8+ and CD8+CD28- T cells."
16275,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus-associated Guillain-Barré syndrome (HIV-GBS) has been reported since 1985. Based on previous reports, this neuropathy typically occurs early in HIV infection, even at seroconversion, prior to developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Patients with GBS and CD4 counts of <50 have been proposed to have cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and empiric gancyclovir is recommended. We reviewed medical records of 10 patients with HIV-GBS at five hospitals from 1986 to 1999. The mean CD4 count was 367/mm(3) (range 55-800). GBS was the first symptom of HIV infection in three patients. Four patients had AIDS with CD4 counts ranging from 55 to 190. CSF white blood cell (WBC) was 0 wbc/mm(3) in four patients, 2-10 wbc/mm(3) in three and 11-17 wbc/mm(3) in two. Three had recurrent weakness from 9 weeks to 4 years after the onset of symptoms, which persisted. HIV-GBS occurs in early and late stages of HIV infection, and may follow the onset of AIDS. No patients were seen with severe immunosuppression (CD4<50). A mild cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis in GBS suggests HIV infection, but is frequently absent. Compared to HIV-negative people, HIV-GBS may be associated with more frequent recurrent episodes or the development of CIDP."

The aim of the present study was to compare serum IgE levels in HIV-positive and -negative children hospitalized with pneumonia in South Africa and to investigate whether IgE may be useful as a marker of specific infections or prognosis in HIV-infected children. History, examination, blood tests, and induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage were carried out. Of 122 children [45% female, median age 8 months (3-20 months)], 81 were infected with HIV. A history of allergy or asthma was present in three children (two of whom were HIV positive). Serum IgE was higher in HIV-infected children [83 (33-147) vs. 29 (6-113) IU/l; p = 0.011] as was immunoglobulin G (IgG) [49 (37-63) vs. 27.5 (23-34) g/l; p < 0.001].

Bacteremia occurred in 12 (10%) children; other specific pathogens identified included Mycobacterium tuberculosis in eight (7%) and Pneumocystis carinii in nine (7%). There was no correlation with CD4 count, CD4 : CD8 ratio, or the presence of specific pathogens, and IgE level. In-hospital mortality (11%) did not correlate with IgE levels. HIV-infected children with pneumonia have higher serum IgE compared with seronegative patients. In HIV-positive children, IgE levels did not correlate with the degree of immunosuppression or with outcome."

A retrospective cohort study was conducted, based on routinely collected data by the Family Advocacy, Care and Education Services (FACES) of Children's Hospital (New Orleans, Louisiana) on children (n 586) of 231 HIV-infected mothers followed from July 1, 2001 to March 20, 2003. The 3-month period prevalence of separation from mother ranged between 12.7% and 21.2% over the course of follow-up. At baseline, 14% of children were separated from their mothers. Over the course of follow-up, older children (6 to 17 years), those with mothers who used illegal drugs and/or alcohol and who suffered from mental health problem(s), those whose mothers did not live at a permanent residence, and children with mothers who had a CD4 cell count below 200 cells per microliter were more likely to be separated from their mother. No significant differences in substance use, mental health, CD4 count, or other sociodemographics were identified between women lost to follow-up and those who remained in care. Substance use and mental health problems played a role in maternal-child separation among the HIV-positive women in this sample, even after clinical status and socioeconomic factors were taken into account. Providing additional resources for substance use and mental health treatment may help to prevent or reduce maternal-child separation among similar populations."

Case reports early in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic suggested that adverse human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related clinical outcomes might be causally associated with pregnancy. A review of relevant published data indicates that: (1) Adverse clinical outcomes of pregnancy are common among HIV-infected pregnant women, but no studies to date have fully disentangled the many confounding factors. (2) HIV-related complications are common in pregnancy only among immunosuppressed (< 300 CD4+ cells/mm3) women. (3) The distinct effect of pregnancy on the expression of HIV infection cannot be evaluated in the absence of appropriately controlled observations. (4) Cofactors for perinatal transmission are poorly understood. (5) Research into the motives for reproductive decisions and behaviors is of critical importance for improving our health education and outreach efforts for high-risk women.

2238,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has become a treatable chronic disease with near-normal life expectancy when patients receive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Family physicians and other primary care clinicians commonly provide long-term comprehensive care for persons with HIV infection. This article describes the scope of initial care, including obtaining a thorough history; physical examination for HIV-associated manifestations; attention to HIV-specific immunization schedules; routine and HIV-specific laboratory evaluation; and ensuring standard health care maintenance to prevent HIV- and non-HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Clinicians should encourage combination ART as early as possible, although careful assessment of patient readiness and ability to sustain lifelong treatment must be weighed. After ART initiation, monitoring viral load and CD4 lymphocyte response is essential to ensure viral suppression and evaluate immune system restoration. Opportunistic infections are now less common than in the past because ART usually prevents or markedly delays progression to advanced HIV disease. The most important reasons for consultation or comanagement with an HIV expert include management of antiretroviral drug resistance or drug toxicities, as well as special circumstances such as viral hepatitis coinfection or pregnancy."

Data were collected from a review of documents and electronic case-records and collation of laboratory results with respect to CD4 counts. One hundred and nine patients were admitted during this period. Their mean age was 33.4 years, and 62% were male. On admission, the mean CD4 count +/- standard deviation (SD) was 244 +/- 245 (range 2-1,549). The death rate was 12%. The patients were classified as World Health Organization clinical stage 1: 23%, stage 2: 30%, stage 3: 23%, and stage 4: 24% during the admission. The commonest diagnosis recorded was tuberculosis (TB) (23%), which was also the commonest cause of death (38%). Even for those clinicians with limited experience of managing AIDS cases, the commonest problem encountered in this patient group was TB, reflecting the continued high burden of TB on health services in Bangladesh. Additional challenges to managing TB/HIV co-infection include atypical presentations in HIV-infected persons and the complex drug interaction with antiretroviral therapy."
13828,0.005,1.0000,"About one-third of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) are coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) because of shared transmission routes. Studies report that HIV-1 complicates hepatitis C infection by increasing HCV viral load and reducing spontaneous clearance. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) upstream of the IL28B gene have been associated with spontaneous and treatment-induced clearance of HCV infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the SNP rs12979860 of the IL28B gene and spontaneous clearance of HCV infection in a Brazilian HIV-1 population. The SNP was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction digestion in 138 anti-HCV-positive patients. Spontaneous clearance was observed in 34 subjects (24.6%). Genotype distribution was significantly different between spontaneous clearance and HCV chronic patients. The CT/TT genotypes conferred a nearly 3-fold increased odds to chronic HCV infection relative to the CC genotype (odds ratio, 2.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-6.64; p=0.011). In conclusion, the rs12979860 polymorphism is associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV in HIV-1 Brazilian infected patients."

The optimal therapy for disseminated MAC infection is unclear. We compared azithromycin plus ethambutol with clarithromycin plus ethambutol in the treatment of disseminated MAC infection in HIV type 1-infected patients, examining the frequency of bacteremia clearance, time to clearance, and study drug tolerance after 16 weeks of therapy. Fifty-nine patients for whom blood cultures were positive for MAC were enrolled in the study from 10 university-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. Thirty-seven patients were evaluable for determination of quantitative bacteremia and clinical outcomes. Clearance of bacteremia was seen at the final visit in 37.5% of azithromycin-treated patients and in 85.7% of clarithromycin-treated patients (P = .007). The estimated median time to clearance of bacteremia was also significantly different between the two treatment arms: 4.38 weeks for clarithromycin recipients vs. > 16 weeks for azithromycin recipients (P = .0018). Only one isolate developed macrolide resistance during therapy. Abatement of symptoms, other laboratory-evident abnormalities, and adverse effects were similar in the two groups. At the doses used in this study, clarithromycin/ethambutol produced a more rapid resolution of bacteremia than did azithromycin/ethambutol, and clarithromycin/ethambutol was more effective at sterilization of blood cultures after 16 weeks of therapy."

This study analyzed the clinical, virological, and pharmaceutical factors that influence the effect of the combination therapy. Patients negative for hepatitis B virus e antigen (HBeAg) and with low HBV DNA titers immediately prior to the combination therapy effectively cleared serum HBV DNA (P=0.0348 and P=0.0310, respectively). The maximum concentration of ADV in serum (ADV Cmax) was higher in patients who showed HBV DNA clearance (P=0.0392), and the cumulative clearance rates of HBV DNA were significantly higher in patients with ADV Cmax equal to or greater than 24 ng/ml (P=0.0284). HBeAg negativity and lower HBV DNA at the start of the combination therapy and higher ADV Cmax were found to be independent factors for serum HBV DNA clearance. Serum creatinine increased significantly during the combination therapy, and the ADV Cmax was higher in patients with low creatinine clearance rates. In conclusion, higher serum concentrations of ADV are associated with a good response to therapy based on clearance of HBV DNA in serum. However, care should be taken to prevent worsening of renal function due to high ADV serum concentrations."

A detailed analysis of HBV infection under TNF-α blockage therapy is essential for the prophylaxis and therapy for HBV reactivation and recurrence. In this study, HBV clearance and T-cell responses were analyzed in a HBV-transfected mouse model under anti-TNF blockage therapy. Our results demonstrated that under TNF-α blockage therapy, HBV viral clearance was impaired with persistent elevated HBV viral load in a dose- and temporal-dependent manner. The impairment of HBV clearance under anti-TNF-α blockage therapy occurred at early time points after HBV infection. In addition, TNF-α blockade maintained a higher serum HBV viral load and increased the number of intrahepatic programmed cell death (PD)-1(high)CD127(low) exhausted T cells. Furthermore, TNF-α blockade abolished Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand-induced facilitation of HBV viral clearance. Taken together, TNF-α blockade impairs HBV clearance and enhances viral load, and these effects depend on early administration after HBV infection. Our results here demonstrate that early TNF-α blockade reduces viral clearance and persistently maintains elevated HBV viral load in a mouse model, suggesting that HBV may reactivate during therapy with TNF-α-blocking agents."
8573,0.005,1.0000,"The development of vaccination and novel therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been hampered by the lack of suitable small-animal models. GB virus B (GBV-B), closely related to HCV, causes viral hepatitis in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchue jacchus) and might represent an attractive surrogate model for HCV infection. However, differences exist between GBV-B and HCV in spite of a short genetic distance between the two viruses. Here we report common marmosets infected with two HCV/GBV-B chimeras containing HCV structural genes coding for either whole core and envelope proteins (CE1E2p7) or full envelope proteins (E1E2p7) substituted for the counterpart elements of GBV-B. Naïve animals intrahepatically injected with chimeric RNA transcripts or intravenously injected with sera from primary infected animals produced high levels of circulating infectious chimeric viruses and they developed chronic infection. Tacrolimus-treated marmosets inoculated with a CE1E2p7 chimera had higher viral loads and long-term persistent infection. A moderate elevation of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels was observed in parallel with viral replication. Chimeras recovered from liver samples revealed 1/958 adaptive viral mutations. Histopathological changes typical of viral hepatitis were observed in liver tissues from all types of HCV chimeras-infected marmosets. HCV core and E2 proteins were detected in liver tissues from infected animals by immunohistochemical staining. Fluctuations of chimeric virus replication in marmosets with spontaneous and sporadic viral clearance might be related to specific antibody and T-cell response to HCV proteins in vivo. Replication of CE1E2p7 chimera was observed in primary hepatocyte cultures by immunofluorescent staining in vitro."
3958,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis C affects 2.2-3.0% of the world population (130 million-170 million). Pegylated interferon-α (PEG-IFN-α) in combination with ribavirin (RBV), the approved and standard therapy, leads to viral eradication in about 50% of treated patients. In 2009, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified host genetic variation to be critical for predicting treatment response and spontaneous clearance in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). A correlated set of polymorphisms in the region of the interleukin-28B (IL-28B) gene on chromosome 19, coding for interferon (IFN)-λ3 were associated with clearance of genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) in patients treated with PEG-IFN-α and RBV. The same polymorphisms were subsequently associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV in untreated patients. In addition, prediction of viral response to PEG-IFN-α and RBV therapy of patients with recurrent HCV infection after orthotopic liver transplantation depends on the IL-28B genotype of both recipient and donor tissues. Diagnosis of a patient's IL-28B genotype is likely to aid in clinical decision making with standard-of-care regimens. Future studies will investigate the possibility of individualizing treatment duration and novel regimens according to IL-28B genotype. As GWAS yield unexpected data, this approach could lead to the development of novel drug therapy, such as already appears promising with IFN-λ. In this Okuda lecture, I present the current understanding in regard to the relationship between host variations and clinical outcome of hepatitis C."
19412,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) viral infection or co-infection leads to risk of development of chronic infection, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immigration and globalization have added to the challenges of public health concerns regarding chronic HBV and HCV infections worldwide. The aim of this study is to review existing global literature across ethnic populations on HBV and HCV related human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations in relation to susceptibility, viral persistence and treatment. Extensive literature search was conducted to explore the HLA associations in HBV and HCV infections reported across global populations over the past decade to understand the knowledge status, weaknesses and strengths of this information in different ethnic populations. HLA DR13 is consistently associated with HBV clearance globally. HLADRB1*11/*12 alleles and DQB1*0301 are associated with HBV persistence but with HCV clearance worldwide. Consistent association of DRB1*03 and *07 is observed with HCV susceptibility and non-responsiveness to HBV vaccination across the population. HLA DR13 is protective for vertical HBV and HCV transmission in Chinese and Italian neonates, but different alleles are associated with their susceptibility in these populations. HLA class I molecule interactions with Killer cell immunoglobulin like receptors (KIR) of natural killer (NK) cells modulate HCV infection outcome via regulating immune regulatory cells and molecules. HLA associations with HBV vaccination, interferon therapy in HBV and HCV, and with extra hepatic manifestations of viral hepatitis are also discussed. Systematic studies in compliance with global regulatory standards are required to identify the HLA specific viral epitope, stage specific T cell populations interacting with different HLA alleles during disease progression and viral clearance of chronic HBV or HCV infections among different ethnic populations. These studies would facilitate stage specific therapeutic strategies for clearance of HBV and HCV infections or co-infections across global populations and aid in identification of HBV-HCV combined vaccine. HLA associations of chronic HBV or HCV development with confounding host factors including alcohol, drug abuse, insulin resistance, age and gender are lacking and warrant detailed investigation across global populations."
1819,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) only recently established an epidemic world-wide infection in the human population. The virus persists in the human host through active replication and is able to avoid clearance by the immune system. Active replication is an important component of the rapid evolutionary potential of HIV-1, a potential which manifests itself in the evolution of immune escape variants, drug resistant variants, and variants with the ability to use different cell surface coreceptors in conjunction with CD4. Multiple zoonotic introductions, compartmentalization of virus replication in the body, and genetic bottlenecks associated with sampling during transmission, antiretroviral therapy, and geographic and/or host population isolation further contribute to the range of sequences present in extant viruses. The sum of the history of all of these phenomena is reflected in HIV-1 sequence variability, and most of these phenomena are ongoing today. Here we review the use of HIV-1 sequence variability to explore its underlying biology."
5058,0.005,1.0000,"Even though new drugs have been approved for treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the risk of drug-drug interactions and concern about overlapping toxicities has hindered the development of studies in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals. Traditional treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (peg-IFN + RBV) is very expensive and has a low rate of sustained virological response in coinfected patients, especially if they are infected with HCV genotype 1. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is a drug that is being evaluated for the treatment of chronic HCV infection, both in HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Understanding the NTZ resistance mechanism could allow the development of resistance to be minimized and would expand the treatment options, mainly in special populations such as HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Similarly to IFN, NTZ increases the activity of the cellular protein kinase activated by double-stranded RNA (PKR), a key kinase in the innate antiviral response. In order to elucidate whether sequence heterogeneity in the PKR-binding domain of HCV NS5A genotype 1 could influence the antiviral activity of either NTZ monotherapy or peg-IFN + RBV, baseline and end-of-therapy plasma samples from two groups of eleven non-responder HIV/HCV-coinfected patients that had received NTZ or peg-IFN + RBV were studied. Most of the HCV NS5A sequences examined at the end of therapy did not change from the baseline, even after 30 days course of antiviral therapy. An extensive comparison of HCV NS5A genotype 1 and 4 sequences from the database with reported IFN therapy outcome was performed in order to infer their phylogenetic relationships. The HCV genotype 1 NS5A nucleotide sequences from therapy-non-responder patients were intermingled amongst those from the database, irrespective of their IFN-therapy outcome. When comparing NS5A-PKRBD amino acid sequences, significant differences were observed in genotype 4, but not in genotype 1 (p < 0.0001 and p > 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, despite IFN and NTZ sharing the protein kinase activated by double-stranded RNA as their cellular target, the HCV genotype 1 strategy to counteract the IFN action mediated by NS5A ISDR/PKRBD does not explain drug resistance in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Other viral factors that are possibly involved are discussed as well. "
9467,0.005,1.0000,"Approximately 287,000 individuals in the USA are coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C. Recently, new hepatitis C regimens have become available, increasing rates of sustained virologic response in the monoinfected, with studies evaluating their success in the coinfected under way. Previous investigators estimated eligibility for hepatitis C therapy among the coinfected patients, but all had significant methodological limitations. Our study is the first to use a multi-year, statewide, population-based sample to estimate treatment eligibility, and the first to estimate eligibility in the setting of an interferon-free regimen. In a population-based sample of 161 patients infected with HIV and hepatitis C living in Oregon during 2007-2010, 21% were eligible for hepatitis C therapy. Despite the anticipation surrounding an interferon-sparing regimen, eligibility assuming an interferon-free regimen increased only to 26%, largely due to multiple simultaneous contraindications. Obesity was described for the first time as being associated with decreased eligibility (OR: 0.11). Active alcohol abuse was the most common contraindication (24%); uncontrolled mental health (22%), recent injection drug use (21%), poor antiretroviral adherence (22%), and infection (21%) were also common excluding conditions. When active drug or alcohol abuse was excluded as contraindications to therapy, the eligibility rate was 34%, a 62% increase. Assuming an interferon-free regimen and the exclusion of active drug or alcohol abuse as contraindications to therapy, the eligibility rate increased to 42%. Despite the availability of direct-acting anti-viral regimens, eligibility rates in HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection are modest. Many factors precluding hepatitis C therapy are reversible, and targeted interventions could result in increased eligibility. "

12026,0.005,1.0000,"Coinfection with GBV-C/HGV in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) may influence clinical course and response rates of antiviral therapy. Aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of GBV-C/HGV/HCV coinfection and its influence on outcome of interferon/ribavirin combination therapy. Three hundred and four patients with CHC [m/f = 211/93, age: 42 (18-65)] were investigated. HGV RNA detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction prior to and 6 months after the end of antiviral therapy. HGV/HCV coinfection could be identified in 37/304 (12.2%) patients with intravenous drug abuse as the most common source of infection (N = 21, (56.8%)). The predominant HCV genotype in coinfected individuals was HCV-3a (HCV-3a: 51.4%, HCV-1: 37.8%, HCV-4: 10.8%). HGV coinfection was more prevalent in patients infected with HCV-3 compared to HCV-1 or HCV-4 [19/45 (42.2%) vs. 14/185 (7.6%) vs. 4/52 (7.7%), P < 0.01]. Patients with HGV/HCV coinfection were younger [35 (18-56) vs. 43 (19-65), years; P < 0.01], and advanced fibrosis (F3-F4) was less frequent (22.2% vs. 42.9%, P < 0.05). A sustained virological response was achieved more frequently in HGV/HCV coinfected patients [26/37 (70.3%)] than in monoinfected patients [120/267 (44.9%), P < 0.01]. HGV RNA was undetectable in 65.7% of the coinfected patients at the end of follow-up. Intravenous drug abuse seems to be a major risk factor for HGV coinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Coinfection with HGV does not worsen the clinical course of chronic hepatitis C or diminish response of HCV to antiviral therapy. Interferon/ribavirin combination therapy also clears HGV infection in a high proportion of cases."

Prediction analysis using pretherapy samples identified 79 genes that correctly classified all 10 patients who did not respond to therapy, 8 of 10 patients with a response at the end of treatment, and 7 of 9 patients with sustained virological response (86% overall). Analysis of 17 posttreatment samples identified 105 genes that correctly classified all 9 patients with response at the end of treatment and 7 of 8 patients with sustained virological response (94% overall). Failure of anti-HCV therapy was associated with elevated expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Gene expression patterns may provide a tool to predict anti-HCV therapeutic response."
14416,0.005,1.0000,"There is limited information about the long-term efficacy of prolonged therapy (more than 6 months) with interferon alpha in hemophilic patients with chronic hepatitis C who are not coinfected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). One hundred and seven hemophiliacs were randomly assigned to 3 million U of interferon alpha2b three times weekly for 12 months or no therapy. The patients were followed up for at least 12 months posttreatment. Response was assessed by both serial alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA measured by reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Before treatment, serum levels of HCV-RNA were measured quantitatively by second-generation branched-DNA assay and the HCV genotype was determined by RT-PCR. Serum HGV-RNA, a marker of infection with the hepatitis G virus, was also measured by RT-PCR. Normalization of ALT was sustained and serum HCV-RNA was cleared in 6 of 45 treated patients, compared with none of the 50 untreated controls (13% v 0% P < .01). Low pretreatment viremia was the only feature that was associated with an increased likelihood of sustained response (P < .01). This study shows that multitransfused hemophiliacs with chronic hepatitis C not coinfected with HIV-1 respond at low rates to prolonged interferon therapy."
858,0.005,1.0000,"With highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-infected patients can now live longer and healthier lives, and other comorbid diseases, such as chronic hepatitis C, have emerged as a significant health concern. Coinfection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) may limit life expectancy because it can lead to serious liver disease including decompensated liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV-induced fibrosis progresses faster in HIV/HCV-coinfected persons, although HAART may be able to decrease this disease acceleration. Combination therapy for HCV with interferon and ribavirin can achieve a sustained viral response, although at a lower rate than in HCV-monoinfected patients. Combination treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin will probably emerge as the next HCV therapy of choice for HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. HCV combination therapy is generally safe, but serious adverse reactions, like lactic acidosis, may occur. Cytopenia may present a problem leading to dose reductions, but the role of growth factors is under study. All HIV/HCV-coinfected patients should be evaluated for therapy against the hepatitis C virus. A sustained viral load will probably lead to regression of liver disease, and even interferon-based treatment without viral clearance may slow down progression of liver disease. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who have progressed to end-stage liver disease have few therapeutic options other than palliative care, since liver transplants are generally unavailable. The mortality post-transplant may be higher than in HCV-monoinfected patients. We are entering an era where safe and effective HCV therapy is being defined for HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, and all eligible patients should be offered treatment."

In a pilot study, we investigated the efficacy of a lead-in therapy with silibinin before triple therapy in difficult-to-treat patients."
18636,0.005,1.0000,"At present the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection is based on the combination of pegylated interferon (PEG-INF) and rivabirin (RBV) and basically attempts to eradicate the viral infection (sustained viral response). The pattern depends above all on the viral genotype, hence, patients with genotype 1, 4 and 5 require 48 weeks of treatment and high doses of RBV, while those with genotype 2 and 3 require 24 weeks of treatment and low doses of RBV. All patients with chronic C infection are possible candidates for antiviral therapy. However, given that the response to treatment is variable, that the treatment has secondary effects and supposes a high economic cost, it is recommendable in patients with hypertransaminasemia and moderate-severe chronic hepatitis in the histological study, as long as there are no counter-indications. This does not exclude other groups of patients who should be evaluated individually. In those patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis, treatment can stabilise the disease and reduce the risk of complications appearing, although the rate of response is lower and some adverse effects are more frequent. In patients who have received previous antiviral treatment with standard interferon, alone or in association with RBV, without response to this or with response but later relapse, the decision on treatment must be individual. In patients with coinfection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), special attention must be paid to the degree of evolution of the disease due to HCV and to HIV, as well as the possible hepatoxicity of the antiretroviral treatment and the risk of secondary effects."

A total of 1763 couples in which one partner was HIV-1-positive and the other was HIV-1-negative were enrolled in four continents, nine countries and thirteen study sites. The HIV-1-positive partner was randomly assigned to either of the two arms: ""immediate"" (early) therapy with ART initiated upon enrollment plus HIV primary care, or ""delayed"" therapy with HIV primary care but ART initiated when the index case would have two consecutive measurements of a CD4+ cell count within or below the range of 200-250 cells/mm(3), or develop an AIDS-defining illness. In this paper, we describe several key statistical considerations for the design of this landmark study. Despite that the observed event rates were lower than expected, which might have compromised the study power, an early release of the trial results in May 2011 showed an overwhelming 96% risk reduction for the immediate therapy in the prevention of genetically linked HIV-1 incident transmissions. Nevertheless, the durability of its long-term effectiveness is yet to be assessed. The HPTN 052 Study is still ongoing and will not complete till 2015."

The side effects associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) lead to multiple metabolic disorders, making the management of these metabolic issues and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in those treated with ART a critical issue. Clinical research trials, primarily clinical exercise, rarely include this population due to unique challenges in research methods with underserved minority populations living with a life threatening illness like HIV/AIDS.

In a prospective open-label phase I/IIa trial, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of administration of the T cell regulator IL-7. The trial included 13 c-ART-treated HIV-infected patients whose CD4+ cell counts were between 100 and 400 cells/microl and plasma HIV RNA levels were less than 50 copies/ml. Patients received a total of 8 subcutaneous injections of 2 different doses of recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7; 3 or 10 microg/kg) 3 times per week over a 16-day period. rhIL-7 was well tolerated and induced a sustained increase of naive and central memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In the highest dose group, 4 patients experienced transient increases in viral replication. However, functional assays showed that the expanded T cells responded to HIV antigen by producing IFN-gamma and/or IL-2. In conclusion, in lymphopenic HIV-infected patients, rhIL-7 therapy induced substantial functional and quantitative changes in T cells for 48 weeks. Therefore, patients may benefit from intermittent therapy with IL-7 in combination with c-ART."

We determined the association between chronic HCV infection and GBD in a representative sample of adults in the United States. Data on HCV infection and GBD were available for 13,465 persons 20 to 74 years of age who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The presence of GBD (gallstones or cholecystectomy) was determined using abdominal ultrasonography, and HCV infection was assessed via a positive HCV antibody test and a positive HCV RNA test. Overall, 1.6% of adults (95% CI, 1.1-2.1) had chronic HCV infection and 12.5% (95% CI, 11.3-13.7) had GBD. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, the odds of gallstones (OR = 3.20; 95% CI, 1.08-9.45) and cholecystectomy (OR = 4.57; 95% CI, 1.57-13.27) among HCV-positive men was significantly higher compared with HCV-negative men.

In the present study, sexual and intrafamilial transmission of HCV infection were assessed in the family members of 200 Egyptian patients (index patients) with HCV-RNA positive and biopsy ascertained chronic hepatitis C. Index patients were 139 men (mean age 55+/-11 years) and 61 women (mean age 48+/-8 years). Family members consisted of 200 spouses; 139 women (mean age 45+/-12 years) and 61 men (mean age 58+/-9 years); and 355 children (183 males and 172 females, mean age 11.8+/-10 years). All the family members were tested for the presence of antibodies to HCV in their sera. Thereafter, HCV-RNA detection by PCR and HCV serotype determination were performed in antibody positive contacts. Hepatitis C virus antibodies were detected in 28 (14%) spouses, all of them were also positive for HCV-RNA. Hepatitis C virus serotypes were identical in HCV seropositive patient-spouse pairs (Serotype 4). None of the 355 children involved in this study showed HCV antibodies in their sera. No significant difference was found between the prevalence of male-to-female and female-to-male transmission of HCV. A highly significant association was found between both the age of the spouse and the duration of marriage to index patient and HCV seropositivity in spouses. Moreover, HCV seropositivity in spouses was significantly related to increased serum ALT and HCV-RNA levels, histological severity of chronic hepatitis C and to a history of dental care, as a risk factor for HCV acquisition, in index patients. It was concluded that spouses of patients with HCV viremia and chronic liver disease have an increased risk for acquiring HCV, while intrafamilial acquisition of HCV in non sexual contacts seems to be rare. The authors suggest that spouses of HCV viraemic patients should be followed routinely for markers of HCV infection and liver disease."

In a retrospective study we analysed the laboratory data of 99 HIV-positive MSM who acquired HCV during the observation period (cases) and 176 HIV-positive MSM who remained HCV negative during the observation period (controls), all followed at the HIV/STI-clinic in Antwerp, Belgium. All laboratory confirmed STI-episodes were recorded since the date of first consultation at our clinic, until the date of HCV-diagnosis of the cases. The HCV incidence varied between 0.24 (2001) and 1.36 (2011) new cases per hundred person-years, with a peak of 2.93 new cases per hundred person-years in 2009. The number of STI-episodes per person-year follow-up was significantly higher for the cases as compared to the controls for syphilis, non-LGV and LGV Chlamydia infections (p < 0.005). When considering the incidence of STIs that occurred 1 year prior to HCV conversion, all laboratory confirmed STIs remained more frequent among cases, but only the difference in syphilis incidence was statistically significant (p < 0.01). Recurrent STIs among HIV positive MSM should be considered as a behavioural and biological risk factor for acquiring HCV and should lead to intensified screening for HCV and counselling of the patient.

This study sought to estimate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and syphilis among prison inmates and officers at prisons in Nsawan and Accra, Ghana. Prisoners and officers in 3 of the 46 prisons in Ghana were surveyed from May 2004 to May 2005. Subjects voluntarily completed a risk-factor questionnaire and provided blood specimens for unlinked anonymous testing for the presence of antibodies to HIV, HCV and Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, and the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus (HBsAg). Almost 16% (3770) of the total of 23,980 prison inmates in Ghana were eligible, and 281 (7.5%) of those eligible took part, whilst almost 23% (1120) of the total of 4910 prison officers were eligible, and 82 (7.3%) of those eligible took part. For the 281 inmates tested, HIV seroprevalence was 19.2%, 17.4% had HBsAg, HCV seroprevalence was 19.2% and reactive syphilis serology was noted in 11%. For the 82 officers tested, HIV seroprevalence was 8.5%, 3.7% had HBsAg, HCV seroprevalence was 23.2% and reactive syphilis serology was noted in 4.9%. The data indicate a higher prevalence of HIV and HCV in correctional facilities (both prison inmates and officers) than in the general population in Ghana, suggesting their probable transmission in prisons in Ghana through intravenous drug use, unsafe sexual behaviour and tattooing as pertains to prisons worldwide."

This study aimed to develop and validate a brief measure to assess general knowledge about HCV risk factors, modes of transmissions, and treatment options. A total of 406 individuals participated in this cross-sectional study. All participants completed the proposed 19-item Brief HCV Knowledge Scale. Participants were: HCV mono-infected patients (n = 83), HCV-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infected patients (n = 24), HIV mono-infected patients (n = 128) community healthcare workers (n = 89), and college students (n = 82). Two-week test-retest data were collected for the college student sample. Psychometric evaluation of the proposed scale demonstrated high levels of validity (content and construct validity) and reliability (internal consistency and retest stability). Factor analysis indicated a one-factor solution, which accounted for 49% of the variance. HCV knowledge was positively correlated with length of time since HCV diagnosis (r = 0.29, p < 0.05). HCV treatment-experienced patients obtained significantly higher HCV knowledge scores (82% correct) than HCV treatment-naïve patients (72% correct) (p < 0.05). HCV knowledge in College students (43% correct) and HIV patients (54% correct) was significantly lower than in HCV patients (77% correct) and community healthcare workers (80% correct) (p < 0.001). Community workers' HCV knowledge was positively correlated with years of HCV work experience (r = 0.30, p < 0.01). This self-administered Brief HCV Knowledge scale has high levels of validity and reliability across patient, healthcare provider and college student populations.

The diagnosis of HIV infection was confirmed by immunoblotting after a positive ELISA screening test. The patient data for analysis were extracted from the patients' medical charts. Analysis of peripheral blood and urine, blood biochemistry tests were performed for each patient. The flow cytometry was used to determine the CD3, CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes in the whole blood. Detection and quantification of HCV RNA in clinical samples of serum or plasma was performed by reverse transcription of viral RNA followed by amplification using DNA real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) with hybridization-fluorescence detection of PCR products in real-time. Statistical analysis was performed using STATISTICA software package. Student's t test was used to evaluate the differences between the means. HCV antibodies were detected in 73 patients out of 181. HCV genotyping showed presence of first genotype in 18 (24.7%), genotype 2 in 19 (26.0%) and genotype 3 in 36 (49.3%) patients. The third genotype was the most prevalent according to our study. More severe immunosuppression was observed in patients with HCV genotypes 1 and 3 in comparison with those with HCV genotype 2. HCV infection is a negative risk-factor in the course of HIV infection, accelerating the decrease of CD4+ cells. The greatest risk of progression of HIV infection to AIDS occurs in the presence of HCV genotype 1 and 3 which can be explained by more aggressive course of the disease and a poorer prognosis in comparison with the infection with genotype 2.

15809,0.005,1.0000,"Tuberculosis (TB) has been the most common opportunistic infection and cause of mortality among HIV-infected patients, especially in resource-limited countries. Clinical manifestations of TB vary and depend on the degree of immunodeficiency. Sputum microscopy and culture with drug-susceptibility testing are recommended as a standard method for diagnosing active TB. TB-related mortality in HIV-infected patients is high especially during the first few months of treatment. Integrated therapy of both HIV and TB is feasible and efficient to control the diseases and yield better survival. Randomized clinical trials have shown that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) improves survival of HIV-infected patients with TB. A delay in initiating ART is common among patients referred from TB to HIV separate clinics and this delay may be associated with increased mortality risk. Integration of care for both HIV and TB using a single facility and a single healthcare provider to deliver care for both diseases is a successful model. For TB treatment, HIV-infected patients should receive at least the same regimens and duration of TB treatment as HIV-uninfected patients. Currently, a 2-month initial intensive phase of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by 4 months of continuation phase of isoniazid and rifampin is considered as the standard treatment of drug-susceptible TB. ART should be initiated in all HIV-infected patients with TB, irrespective of CD4 cell count. The optimal timing to initiate ART is within the first 8 weeks of starting antituberculous treatment and within the first 2 weeks for patients who have CD4 cell counts <50 cells/mm(3). Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART remains a first-line regimen for HIV-infected patients with TB in resource-limited settings. Although a standard dose of both efavirenz and nevirapine can be used, efavirenz is preferred because of more favorable treatment outcomes. In the settings where raltegravir is accessible, doubling the dose to 800 mg twice daily is recommended. Adverse reactions to either antituberculous or antiretroviral drugs, as well as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, are common in patients receiving integrated therapy. Early recognition and appropriate management of these consequences can reinforce the successful integrated therapy in HIV-infected patients with TB. "
2756,0.005,1.0000,"The potential impact of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) on clinical, immunological and virological responses to initial highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is important to evaluate due to the high prevalence of HIV-HCV coinfection. A historical cohort study was conducted among 824 HIV-infected patients starting HAART at a public referral service in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to assess the impact of HCV seropositivity on appearance of a new AIDS-defining opportunistic illness, AIDS-related death, suppression of viral load, and an increase in CD4-cell count. A total of 76 patients (9.2%) had a positive HCV test, 26 of whom (34.2%) had a history of intravenous drug use. In multivariate analysis, HCV seropositivity was associated with a smaller CD4-cell recovery (RH=0.68; 95% CI [0.49-0.92], but not with progression to a new AIDS-defining opportunistic illness or to AIDS-related death (RH=1.08; 95% CI [0.66-1.77]), nor to suppression of HIV-1 viral load (RH=0.81; 95% CI [0.56-1.17]) after starting HAART. These results indicate that although associated with a blunted CD4-cell recovery, HCV coinfection did not affect the morbidity or mortality related to AIDS or the virological response to initial HAART."

Before starting antiretroviral therapy, he had a CD4 cell count of 316/mm(3) and plasma HIV RNA level was 1,020,537 copies per milliliter. He developed acute renal failure only 2 weeks after introduction of tenofovir-based antiretroviral therapy and then required 3 months of hemodialysis. After the end of hemodialysis, antiviral therapy was resumed with abacavir (300 mg×2/day), lamivudine (300 mg every day), and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily). Renal biopsy revealed severe and diffuse toxic acute tubular necrosis Two years after tenofovir discontinuation, the patient's renal function remained subnormal. Although severe renal toxicity due to tenofovir is rare, patients receiving tenofovir must be monitored closely for renal dysfunction especially during the first weeks of tenofovir therapy."
2197,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver fibrosis progression is accelerated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The effect of protease inhibitor (PI) therapy on liver fibrosis is unknown. The aim of this work was to analyze the impact of PI therapy on HCV-related liver fibrosis in HIV/HCV coinfected patients. We evaluated in a long-term follow-up retrospective cohort study the influence of antiretroviral therapy containing PI on liver fibrosis in 182 consecutive HIV/HCV coinfected patients. At liver biopsy, 63 patients had received PI and 119 patients had never been treated with PI. Relationships between liver histologic features, age, alcohol consumption, CD4 cell count, HIV-RNA load, and antiretroviral regimens were analyzed. Liver fibrosis stage was lower in patients receiving PIs by comparison with patients who had never received PIs (P =.03). The 5-, 15-, and 25-year cirrhosis rates were 2% versus 5%, 5% versus 18%, and 9% versus 27%, respectively, in patients who had received PIs compared with PI-untreated patients (P =.0006). Multivariate analysis identified 4 independent predictors of progression to cirrhosis: absence of protease inhibitor therapy (relative risk [RR] = 4.74, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34-16.67), heavy alcohol consumption (> or = 50 g daily) (RR = 4.71, 95% CI, 1.92-11.57), low CD4 cell count (<200/microL) (RR = 2.74, 95% CI, 1.17-6.41), and age at HCV contamination (> or = 20 years) (RR = 2.37, 95% CI, 1.04-5.38). In conclusion, protease inhibitor therapy might not accelerate progression to HCV-related cirrhosis. Furthermore, chronic use of antiretroviral therapy containing PI together with reduction of alcohol consumption and maintenance of high CD4 count could have a beneficial impact on liver fibrosis progression in HIV/HCV coinfected patients."
16203,0.005,1.0000,"Viral hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are important causes of mortality and morbidity in patients treated by haemodialysis (HD). Both are further promoted by the characteristic immunological dysfunction that develops in renal failure and interferes with the patient's ability to eliminate these viruses. The hepatotropic viruses A through G remain the causative agents in 60 to 80% of hepatitis. But, as far as HD is concerned, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the two most important organisms responsible for almost all the patients' morbidity. In HD, both patients as well as staff are at a high risk of acquiring hepatitis B infection. The prevalence of HBV in the dialysis population in India is reported to range between 3.4% and 42%. The acute course of the infection is often anicteric and peak transaminase concentration is significantly less than in patients with normal renal function. Up to 60% of dialysis patients with HBV infection develop chronic hepatitis with persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and infectivity. The risk of transmission of HBV infection due to blood from one patient to another is mostly because of inadequate precautions taken by the dialysis staff. Combined therapy with interferon (6-10 million units) three times a week and lamivudine (100-300 mg/day) would be more effective in controlling viral replication. The most important modality for prevention of HBV infection is induction of immunity by hepatitis B vaccination. Administration of 40 microg doses at months 0, 1, 2 and 6 is the most rapid immunogenic schedule. The prevalence of HCV in HD patients ranges from 6% in the United Kingdom to 60% in Poland and Eastern Europe, 8-36% in North America. HD patients in different parts of India exhibit high anti-HCV positivity (12.1%, 45.2%, 33.3% and 41.9%) in various studies. The incidence and prevalence of HCV infection among patients on dialysis in developed countries are steadily declining because of (i) reduction in post-transfusion HCV infection, (ii) infection control measures to prevent nosocomial infection. Among HD patients with HCV infection, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) levels are elevated in only 4 to 67% patients who are positive for anti-HCV, in only 12 to 31% patients with HCV RNA and only in one-third of those with biopsy proven hepatitis. Number of blood transfusion, duration of HD treatment, and mode of dialysis are important risk factors. Patient to patient transmission of HCV occurs in HD units by needle stick injury, breakdown in standard infection control practices, physical proximity to an infected patient, dialysis machines, dialysis membranes and HD ultrafiltrate and reprocessing of dialyser. The prevalence of HIV infection in dialysis populations varies according to different countries and geographic areas, 0% and 13% in 1990 and 1995 respectively. There was no evidence of transmission within the centre transmission, from patient to patient or patient to staff. Antiretroviral therapy is the corner-stone of the HIV infection in end stage renal disease (ESRD). Most commonly, zidovudine (AZT) has been used in these patients. Currently recommended dose of 200 mg three times a day is probably safe in these patients."
7679,0.005,1.0000,"Persons who inject drugs (PWID) shoulder the greater part of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic in the USA. PWID are also disproportionately affected by limited access to health care and preventative services. We sought to compare current health care coverage, HCV, and HIV testing history, hepatitis A and B vaccination coverage, and co-occurring substance use among PWID in two US cities with similar estimated numbers of PWID. Using data from the 2009 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system in Denver (n = 428) and Seattle (n = 507), we compared HCV seroprevalence and health care needs among PWID. Overall, 73 % of participants who tested for HCV antibody were positive. Among those who were HCV antibody-positive, vaccination coverage for hepatitis A and B was low (43 % in Denver and 34 % in Seattle) and did not differ significantly from those who were antibody-negative. Similarly, participation in alcohol or drug treatment programs during the preceding 12 months was not significantly higher among those who were HCV antibody-positive in either city. Significantly fewer participants in Denver had health care coverage compared to Seattle participants (45 vs. 67 %, p < 0.001). However, more participants in Seattle reported being disabled for work and, thus, more likely to be receiving health care coverage through the federal Medicaid program. In both cities, the vast majority of those who were aware of their HCV infection reported not receiving treatment (90 % in Denver and 86 % in Seattle). Our findings underscore the need to expand health care coverage and preventative medical services for PWID. Furthermore, our findings point to the need to develop comprehensive and coordinated care programs for infected individuals. "
11179,0.005,1.0000,"Intravenous heroin abusers comprise a high risk group for hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) infection. Chronic alcoholics with liver disease (LD) also comprise a high risk group for HBV infection whereas the frequency of antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) ranges from 27-42.6%. In this study, HBV and HCV infection markers were determined in alcoholic patients with (83 patients) or without LD (68 patients) in order to assess the prevalence of these markers (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAb and anti-HCV). The reason for the study was a lack of established data in this group of patients in Greece. The disease control groups consisted of 70 non-alcoholic hospitalized patients and 60 heroin addicts, whereas 1342 healthy blood donors were also investigated. Our results showed significantly increased prevalence of HBV infection markers in chronic alcoholic patients compared to healthy controls and non-alcoholic hospitalized patients. The findings were independent of the presence or absence of LD. In contrast to heroin addicts, where anti-HCV antibodies were observed in 90%, there was no difference in the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies in chronic alcoholics (with or without LD), nonalcoholic hospitalized patients or healthy controls. In conclusion, we found that in this area of north-western Greece, chronic alcoholics, independent of the presence of LD, comprise a high risk group for HBV infection but very rarely have HCV infection. The latter finding may reflect technical or socio-economic differences regarding the lifestyle of our patients, and our population in general."
3125,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis C patients carry the risk of developing into B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). To clarify the mechanisms underlying this association, we first investigated the molecular markers of B cells from hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients. CD19-positive cells were isolated as B cells from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients infected with the hepatitis C virus and IFN-related gene expression was analyzed. We found that RIG-I and IRF-2 expression were up-regulated in CD19-positive cells from the infected patients. In vitro luciferase reporter analysis using human cell lines indicated that IRF-2 activates the human RIG-I promoter. IRF-2 expression levels were enhanced by HCV cDNA transfection in Huh7 cells. In addition, we observed much less induction in the interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) after Sendai virus (SenV) stimulation of CD19-positive cells from infected patients versus healthy controls, thereby suggesting an impairment of RIG-I downstream signaling in HCV-infected patients. Hence, we found that the failure of the anti-viral response with enhanced IRF-2 oncogenic protein expression in blood B cells from HCV-infected patients. Our results provide important information to better understand the role of IRFs in the cause of HCV chronic infection."
17228,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis represents a frequent event after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). To ascertain the influence of HCV infection on the clinical and histological outcome of these patients, we have investigated the long-term outcome of 22 patients with end-stage chronic liver disease undergoing liver transplant focusing the attention on the role of different HCV genotypes in determining recurrence and severity of post-OLT liver disease. For all patients blood samples taken before OLT and 3 months, 1, 2 and 3 years after OLT were tested for antiHCV antibodies by two different enzyme-linked immuno-assays and by recombinant immuno-blot II and for the presence and type of HCV RNA by nested PCR (5' untranslated region and core gene primers). Of the 16 pre-OLT antiHCV-positive patients, 14 (87.5%) had recurrence of HCV infection while 2 cleared HCV. Pre-OLT genotype recurred in 11 of these 14 patients (2 genotype I) 8 genotype II - in 1 case associated with genotype III - and 1 genotype IV). Of the 6 pre-OLT antiHCV-negative patients, only 1 (16.6%) became persistently HCV-infected, with genotypes I and II. The recurrence of genotype II strictly related with development of severe chronic hepatitis while genotype I and IV were associated with milder forms of liver disease and were more easily cleared."
19849,0.005,1.0000,"We investigated the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in 58 patients with humoral immunodeficiencies. Forty-three of these patients had common variable immunodeficiency (CVI), 2 had sporadic hyperimmunoglobulin M (HIM) syndrome, 2 had immunoglobulin G subclass deficiency, 4 had ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), and 7 had X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Patients with late-onset hypogammaglobulinemia (those with CVI, HIM, or immunoglobulin G subclass deficiency) had a 38.2% prevalence of HCV infection. In patients with XLA or AT, HCV infection was not detectable. Most of the HCV-infected patients had persistent viremia, with histologic findings of chronic hepatitis. Although patients positive for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) had received several lots of immunoglobulin, we were unable to detect any correlation between the time that alanine aminotransferase levels increased and the time that intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was given, except in one patient with CVI. Moreover, we found no differences in the number of blood transfusions, surgical procedures, or administrations of intravenous or intramuscular immunoglobulin between HCV RNA-positive and HCV RNA-negative groups. We concluded that: (1) the incidence of HCV infection in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia is much higher than that reported in the Italian general population; (2) although patients with hypogammaglobulinemia have persistent viremia, they do not show an aggressive course of HCV disease, nor does hepatocarcinoma develop; and (3) intravenous immunoglobulins are only one of several possible causes of HCV transmission in patients with humoral immunodeficiencies."

It is apparent that a viral reservoir persists in virtually all infected individuals receiving HAART. Reservoirs were detected in macrophages and other cells of the blood system, in which even very effective HAART was not able to eliminate the virus. Over the last period of time AIDS research has been focused on the gut and other mucosal tissue as the major site of HIV infection and CD4+ T cells loss. Intestinal bacteria and cells associated with GIT are in close vicinity and so has been raised the idea that bacteria may be involved in AIDS pathogenesis. Matherial/Methods: Bacteria and yeast isolated from a cohort of 67 Cambodian and Kenyan HIV positive children and from a cohort of 62 Slovak and American AIDS patients were analyzed for detection of expression of HIV-1 antigens p17, p24, p55, gp41 and gp120 (Abcam, UK)."
9178,0.005,1.0000,"The determinants of a broad neutralizing antibody (NAb) response and its effect on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) disease progression are not well defined, partly because most prior studies of a broad NAb response were cross-sectional. We examined correlates of NAb response breadth among 70 HIV-infected, antiretroviral-naïve Kenyan women from a longitudinal seroincident cohort. NAb response breadth was measured 5 years after infection against five subtype A viruses and one subtype B virus. Greater NAb response breadth was associated with a higher viral load set point and greater HIV-1 env diversity early in infection. However, greater NAb response breadth was not associated with a delayed time to a CD4(+) T-cell count of <200, antiretroviral therapy, or death. Thus, a broad NAb response results from a high level of antigenic stimulation early in infection, which likely accounts for prior observations that greater NAb response breadth is associated with a higher viral load later in infection."

Thus, many HBV infected patients are co-infected with other viral pathogens. Co-infection appears to increase the risk of progression of liver disease and may have important ramifications on choice of antiviral medication and treatment regimen.

Current multi drug therapies prolong patients' lives and reduce the incidence of neurobehavioural symptoms. However, the impact of therapy on human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1), the causative agent of AIDS, in the brain, is unknown. Some patients develop dementia in spite of the multi drug therapies and others develop subtle neurobehavioural changes that diminish the quality of their prolonged lives. Thus, HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system remains an important clinical concern. Although much is known about neuropathology of HIV-1 infection, major questions about neuropathogenesis remain. How does HIV-1 reach the brain? Is it present in neurons and glial cells? What is the biological and therapeutic significance of neurotropism of HIV-1? What causes neuronal damage and loss? And, is CNS a reservoir of HIV-1? More research in vivo and in situ in humans and in animals, is needed to answer these outstanding questions. Specific experiments addressing these questions are proposed."
7215,0.005,1.0000,"To examine the variables associated with heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), we studied 32 couples in our hemophilia center who had steady sexual relationships for periods more than 1 year. Of the 32 sexual partners of the hemophiliacs, five (15.6%) were HIV seropositive. All five hemophiliacs with HIV transmission to their sexual partners had measurable immunologic deficiencies, as shown by their lower median T-helper (CD-4+) lymphocyte count of 172 cells/mm3. The hemophiliacs without transmission had a slightly higher median CD-4+ count of 297 cells/mm3 (P = .26). To determine if factors other than the degree of immunologic deficiency in the hemophiliac might contribute to HIV transmission, 18 of the 32 couples were studied more intensively by confidential, coded questionnaires. Regular condom use was reported by nine couples (50%). Two of nine women (22%) without condom usage acquired HIV. One of nine women (11%) using condoms was seropositive; she also reported eight needlestick injuries while assisting her spouse with clotting factor treatments. Intravenous drug abuse was reported in two of the five couples with HIV transmission. Thus, hemophiliacs are at risk for transmitting HIV parenterally as well as venereally. Despite various risk behaviours associated with HIV transmission, the prevalence of infection in our cohort of hemophiliacs' sexual partners is low and within the range (6.8-22%) reported by others. This study underscores the need for comprehensive education and counseling in what previously appeared to be a homogeneous clinic population at risk for transmitting HIV to others."

All patients received a standard regimen of 6 months of rifampicin and isoniazid with first 2 months of pyrazinamid with or without cotrimoxazole. Compared with values at start of treatment, median viral load increased by a median of 0.64 log10 copies/ml after 12 months of follow-up (P=0.0002). Median CD4+ T-cell counts were 393 cells/L at start of treatment and 370 cells/L after 12 months of follow-up (P=0.61). Levels of serum activation markers decreased significantly at 12 months of follow-up of the patients for both patients on standard and cotrimoxazole treatment. Levels of viral load, CD4+ T-cell counts, and markers of immune activation were not different for patients on standard treatment of tuberculosis compared with those on standard and cotrimoxazole treatment. Levels of serum activation markers decreased significantly at 12 months of follow-up of the patients for both patients on standard and cotrimoxazole treatment. Because viral load is a predictor of disease progression, its persistent elevated levels in blood of HIV-infected patients co-infected with tuberculosis, who successfully complete TB treatment, may account for the high mortality observed in this population."

Recently, we and others developed animal model systems to elucidate how HIV infection within the brain can lead to impairment of central nervous system function. In this report, we evaluate each of the published animal models for their ability to mirror HIV dementia. Ease of handling and expense were also under consideration. Ultimately, studies in animal systems should permit a better understanding of the nature of HIV-1-induced neurological injury and aid in the development of effective treatments for this dreaded complication of HIV infection."
8971,0.005,1.0000,"The primary cell infected during acute HIV neuropathogenesis is the monocyte-derived macrophage. We have demonstrated that there is activation of the BBB (blood-brain barrier) during acute viral infection and at terminal AIDS. However, it has never been determined if there is a requirement for the virus to be carried through the BBB or how these Trojan horses would be induced to cross the BBB. We added SIVmac251-infected (SIV is simian immunodeficiency virus) mononuclear cells (and their supernatants) to the luminal or abluminal compartment of our BBB model. There was activation of both sides of the BBB model, only if viral-infected cells were added to the luminal compartment, as opposed to the addition of cell-free supernatants. This suggests that cell-associated virus is essential for the activation of the BBB. This, in turn, would be expected to lead to further infiltration of cells capable of viral infection. VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) staining revealed, for the first time, that there is an absolute requirement for virally infected cells, and not just the presence of virus for the activation of the BBB."

An FEP ""chlorine scan"" was performed to identify the most promising sites for substitution of aryl hydrogens. This yielded NNRTIs 8 and 10 with activities (EC50) of 820 and 310 nM for protection of human T-cells from infection by wild-type HIV-1. FEP calculations for additional substituent modifications and change of the core heterocycle readily led to oxazoles 28 and 29, which were confirmed as highly potent anti-HIV agents with activities in the 10-20 nM range. The designed compounds were also monitored for possession of desirable pharmacological properties by use of additional computational tools. Overall, the trends predicted by the FEP calculations were well borne out by the assay results. FEP-guided lead optimization is confirmed as a valuable tool for molecular design including drug discovery; chlorine scans are particularly attractive since they are both straightforward to perform and highly informative."

We studied the sialochemistry of stimulated parotid saliva of 11 patients with HIV associated salivary gland disease and bilateral parotid gland enlargement, and compared these findings with those of 15 HIV negative controls, 13 HIV positive individuals with no salivary gland involvement and 18 individuals with SS. The patients with HIV associated salivary gland disease had a significant decrease in the level of salivary protein, with increases in salivary IgA, lysozyme and albumin compared to the HIV negative controls. There were no changes in concentration of electrolytes. The sialochemistry among the patients with HIV associated salivary gland disease was unrelated to the degree of immune suppression and did not change over a 6 month period. The observed changes were similar to those of SS but less pronounced. The similar clinical, histologic and sialochemical features of HIV associated salivary gland disease and SS suggest that these conditions share common pathogenetic mechanisms, which may be modified in the former by the HIV infection."

Patients received four intramuscular immunizations with EP HIV-1090 over a 4-month period at one of four doses (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 mg) or received a placebo. The vaccine was determined to be safe and well tolerated at all doses tested. CTL responses were measured from cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells using gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunospot assays, with and without in vitro peptide stimulation (IVS). Responses to one or more vaccine epitopes were detected throughout the course of vaccination in 37.5% (12/32) and 47% (15/32) of vaccine recipients measured without and with IVS, respectively, indicating possible vaccine-induced priming of epitope-specific T cells. However, differences in rates of response to HIV-1 epitopes between vaccine and placebo recipients did not achieve statistical significance. The HIV-1 epitope-specific CTL responses measured in the peripheral blood after vaccination were often low level and short-lived, and therefore, alternative immunization schedules, routes of delivery, or vaccine formulations may be required to increase vaccine potency."
13636,0.005,1.0000,"The ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction has been clearly demonstrated to play an active role in syncytium formation induced by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Since it is known that a high-affinity state of LFA-1 for ICAM-1 can be induced through conformational change, such a high-affinity state may also contribute to the process of syncytium formation. In this study, we have investigated the involvement of the conformational status of LFA-1 in HIV-1-dependent syncytium formation by using the anti-LFA-1 antibody NKI-L16, which is known to activate the high-affinity state. Initial visual observations by light microscopy indeed suggested that the addition of the NKI-L16 antibody led to bigger and more numerous syncytia when different cell lines were tested. To further analyze this NKI-L16-dependent increment of syncytium formation in a quantitative assay, a new luciferase-based assay was developed by using a T-cell line containing an HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven luciferase construct (1G5) in coincubation with an HIV-1-positive cell line (J1.1). Upon fusion, the viral Tat protein could diffuse to the 1G5 cells, leading to a transcriptional increase of the HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase gene. Initial evaluation of this assay showed a good correlation between the level of syncytium formation determined by microscopic observation and the level of measured luciferase activity. In addition, this assay showed a greater induction of enzymatic activity correlating with syncytium formation in comparison to a similar incubation with the HeLa-CD4-LTR-beta-gal indicator cell line. By using this test, NKI-L16 treatment of 1G5/J1.1 cells led to a three- to sevenfold increase in HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase activity. The syncytium-dependent luciferase activity in NKI-L16-treated cells could be blocked by classical syncytium inhibitors such as soluble CD4, anti-CD4, and anti-gp120 antibodies. Inhibition could also be observed with specific blocking agents for the chemokine receptor CXCR4, as well as with soluble ICAM-1, anti-LFA-1, anti-ICAM-1, and anti-ICAM-2 blocking antibodies, indicating the requirement for the LFA-1/ICAM interaction. Treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with NKI-L16 resulted in a higher level of syncytium formation in the presence of the cell line J1.1. Conversely, when PBMCs were infected with two different syncytium-inducing HIV-1 primary isolates, coincubation with NKI-L16-pretreated 1G5 cells led to higher levels of luciferase activity for both virus isolates. Our results therefore show for the first time a direct role for the LFA-1 high-affinity state in virus-mediated syncytium formation. Based on the demonstration that an increase in ICAM-1 binding is induced by T-cell activation, these data suggest an in vivo involvement of the high-affinity state of LFA-1 in HIV-1-induced syncytium formation. Moreover, syncytia might preferentially occur in lymph nodes, since this microenvironment harbors a high proportion of activated T cells."
19705,0.005,1.0000,"New outbreaks of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) among injecting drug users (IDUs) are spreading in China along heroin trafficking routes. Recently, two separate HIV-1 epidemics among IDUs were reported in Guangxi, Southern China, where partial sequencing of the env gene showed subtype C and circulating recombinant form (CRF) AE. We evaluated five virtually full-length HIV-1 genome sequences from IDUs in Guangxi to determine the genetic diversity and the presence of intersubtype recombinants. Sequence analysis showed two geographically separated, highly homogeneous HIV-1 strains. B/C intersubtype recombinants were found in three IDUs from Baise City, in a mountainous region near the Yunnan-Guangxi border. These were mostly subtype C, with portions of the capsid and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes from subtype B. The subtype B portion of the capsid was located in the N-terminal domain, which has been shown to influence virus core maturation, virus infectivity, and binding to cyclophilin A, whereas the subtype B portion of RT was located in the palm subdomain, which is the active site of the enzyme. These BC recombinants differed from a BC recombinant found in Xinjiang Province in northwestern China. CRF AE strains were found in IDUs from Nanning, the capital of Guangxi, and in IDUs from Pingxiang City near the China-Vietnam border. The AE and BC recombinants were both remarkable for their low interpatient diversity, less than 1% for the full genome. Rapid spread of HIV-1 among IDUs may foster the emergence of highly homogeneous strains, including novel recombinants in regions with multiple subtypes."
11007,0.005,1.0000,"We have examined cell-free viral populations in the blood plasma and seminal plasma compartments of men infected with subtype C human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) using the V3-specific heteroduplex tracking assay (V3-HTA). We studied two cohorts of subjects who had visited either a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic for genital tract inflammation in the form of urethritis (n = 43) or a dermatology clinic (controls, n = 14) in Malawi. We have previously shown that the presence of urethritis is associated with an eightfold increase in virus load in the seminal plasma compartment (M. S. Cohen et al., Lancet 349:1868-1873, 1997). The purpose of this study was to determine whether genital tract inflammation and its treatment caused genetic instability in cell-free HIV-1 populations. In a cross-sectional analysis at study entry, three-fourths of the STD and control subjects had multiple V3 populations in their blood while 60% of the STD subjects and 79% of the control subjects had multiple V3 populations in their semen. Overall, one-fourth of all of the subjects showed discordance between results with blood and semen specimens when samples were compared for the presence and absence of subpopulations. When differences in the relative levels of abundance of bands were also taken into account, two-fifths of all of the subjects showed discordance between the compartments. Among the subset of subjects in whom multiple virus populations could be detected, half showed discordance between the compartments. There were no differences between STD and control cohorts for these comparisons of the compartments in this cross-sectional analysis at study entry. Longitudinal analysis of the viral populations from two separate clinic visits over 1 to 4 weeks showed that the complexity of each V3 population as measured by Shannon entropy was different in blood and semen at the two time points, indicating that the blood and semen constitute different compartments for HIV-1. The seminal plasma compartment was more dynamic than the blood plasma compartment for the STD subjects who were treated for urethritis, with changes being noted in the presence or absence of V3-HTA bands in the semen of 29% of these subjects but in the blood of only 9% of these subjects. However, the changes were generally small. Overall, our results suggest that 40% of male subjects show discordance between seminal and blood viral populations and that the complexity of each V3 population was different between the two compartments. Both of these results point to the partial independence of the seminal compartment as a viral niche within the body."
9935,0.005,1.0000,"The role of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strain variability remains a key unanswered question in HIV dementia, a condition affecting around 20% of infected individuals. Several groups have shown that viruses within the central nervous system (CNS) of infected patients constitute an independently evolving subset of HIV strains. A potential explanation for the replication and sequestration of viruses within the CNS is the preferential use of certain chemokine receptors present in microglia. To determine the role of specific chemokine coreceptors in infection of adult microglial cells, we obtained a small panel of HIV type 1 brain isolates, as well as other HIV strains that replicate well in cultured microglial cells. These viruses and molecular clones of their envelopes were used in infections, in cell-to-cell fusion assays, and in the construction of pseudotypes. The results demonstrate the predominant use of CCR5, at least among the major coreceptors, with minor use of CCR3 and CXCR4 by some of the isolates or their envelope clones."
1035,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) viral load determinations are among the most important markers in the follow-up of patients infected with these viruses. External quality control tools are crucial to ensure the accuracy of the results obtained by microbiology laboratories. This article summarizes the results obtained from the SEIMC's External Quality Control Program for HIV-1 and HCV viral loads in 2009. In the HIV-1 program, a total of five standards were sent. One standard consisted of seronegative human plasma, while the remaining four contained plasma from three different viremic patients, in the range of 2-5 log(10) copies/mL; two of these standards were identical, aiming to determine repeatability. A significant proportion of the laboratories (21.5% on average) obtained values outside the accepted range (mean ± 0.2 log(10) copies/mL), depending on the standard and on the method used for quantification. Repeatability was very good, with up to 95 % of laboratories reporting results within the accepted limits (Δ<0.5 log10 copies/mL). Post-analytical errors due to mistranscription of the results were detected for HIV-1. The HCV program consisted of two standards with different viral load contents. Most of the participants (79.7%) obtained results within the accepted range (mean ± 1.96 SD log(10) UI/mL). Data from this analysis reinforce the utility of proficiency programs to ensure the quality of the results obtained by a particular laboratory, as well as the importance of the post-analytical phase in overall quality. Due to marked interlaboratory variability, use of the same method and the same laboratory for patient follow-up is advisable."
11122,0.005,1.0000,"Qualitative differences among strains of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) may influence viral infectivity for cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and determine or at least significantly influence the neuropathogenesis of brain infection. In this study, we compared infectivity for these cells in vitro among several different laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains differing in cellular tropism. These strains included three lymphotropic strains (SF2, NL4-3, and SG3.1), two macrophage-tropic strains (SF128A, SF162), and one brain-derived strain (YU2). In microglia, macrophage-tropic strain SF128A established productive infection while the lymphotropic strain SF2 did not. In infected astrocytes, all HIV-1 strains transiently produced variable and much lower levels of p24 antigen. Viral DNA env or tat gene sequences were amplified from infected astrocytes; the amplified signals varied among HIV-1 strains, but the strongest viral DNA signals were obtained from cells infected by the lymphotropic strains SF2 and SG3.1. Transfection of astrocytes with infectious HIV-1 proviral DNA clones confirmed the observation that HIV-1 strains differ in their ability to replicate in astrocytes. Transfection revealed post-entry blocks to replication by macrophage-tropic proviruses pSF128A and pSF162. However, cytomegalovirus (CMV) superinfection of transfected astrocytes enhanced p24 production by lymphotropic HIV-1 proviruses twofold and stimulated p24 production by the otherwise inactive macrophage-tropic proviruses. This study demonstrates the spectrum of HIV-1 strain-associated variation in infectivity for neuroglia, and suggests, in addition, that herpesviral factors or viral-induced cellular factors may stimulate HIV-1 infection in astrocytes and expand the neural cell tropism of certain HIV-1 strains."

We investigated antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among high-risk adults, including MSM, participating in a clinic-based cohort. Survival analysis was used to compare attrition across patient groups. Differences in adherence, weight gain, and CD4 counts after ART initiation were assessed. Among 250 HIV-1-seropositive adults, including 108 MSM, 15 heterosexual men, and 127 women, patient group was not associated with attrition. Among 58 participants who were followed on ART, 40 % of MSM had less than 95 % adherence, versus 28.6 % of heterosexual men and 11.5 % of women. Although MSM gained less weight after ART initiation than women (adjusted difference -3.5 kg/year), CD4 counts did not differ. More data are needed on barriers to adherence and clinical outcomes among African MSM, to ensure that MSM can access care and derive treatment and prevention benefits from ART."
18690,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) in prostate cancer (PCa) patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This is a prospective cohort study of HIV patients undergoing RALP, comparing the demographics, tumor characteristics, complications, and short-term oncological outcomes of HIV-positive men to HIV-negative men using univariate (χ(2), Mann-Whitney test) and multivariable (logistic regression) analyses. From 2007 to 2010, 298 men underwent RALP, 8 of whom were known to be HIV positive. Preoperatively, all eight were taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and had undetectable viral loads (<50); mean CD4 count was 634 cells per mm(3). HIV-positive men were younger (54 versus 62 years, P=0.010) and less likely to be white (P=0.007). There were no significant differences between groups with respect to clinical staging, pathological and oncological outcomes or most complication rates. However, the prevalence of perioperative transfusions (P=0.031) and ileus (P=0.021) were higher in HIV-positive patients. HIV remained significantly associated with risk of transfusion after adjustment for age, race, Gleason sum and clinical T stage (P=0.002). After a median of 2.6 (range 0.03-19.2) months of follow-up, PSA remained undetectable in all eight HIV patients. These data suggest that RALP is safe for, and demonstrates short-term oncological efficacy in, HIV-positive patients with PCa."

The prospective cohort Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV and AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy (SUN Study) monitors the clinical course of HIV-infected individuals treated with combination antiretroviral therapy in 4 US cities. Every 6 months, clinical assessments, medical record abstraction, audio computer-assisted self-interview, and neurocognitive measurements are completed and blood and urine specimens are banked centrally. At enrollment and periodically thereafter, additional techniques such as anal cytology, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, carotid ultrasonography, echocardiography, and abdominal and cardiac computed tomography are performed. From March 2004 through June 2006, 700 participants were enrolled; median age was 41 years, 76% were men, 58% were non-Hispanic white, 62% were men who have sex with men, 78% were taking combination antiretroviral therapy (of whom 86% had an HIV viral load of <400 copies/mL), and median CD4+ T-lymphocyte count was 459 cells/mm(3) (interquartile range: 324-660).

HIV-1-infected men treated with a protease inhibitor-containing regimen (n=223), compared with HIV-1-uninfected men (n=527), were characterized by a lower prevalence of hypertension, a lower mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, a higher prevalence of smoking, a higher mean waist-to-hip ratio, and a higher mean triglyceride level. No difference was found for total plasma or low-density cholesterol levels, nor for the prevalence of diabetes. Similar trends were observed among female subjects. The predicted risk of coronary heart disease was greater among HIV-1-infected men (relative risk [RR], 1.20) and women (RR, 1.59; P<10(-6) for both), compared with the HIV-1-uninfected cohort. The estimated attributable risks due to smoking were 65% and 29% for HIV-1-infected men and women, respectively. Because most HIV-1-infected people will ultimately need antiretroviral therapy, risk factors for cardiovascular disease should be determined at the initiation of treatment, and interventions should be considered for all patients who have them."
891,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to examine the spectrum of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) brain pathology and its clinical correlates in the antiretroviral era. We carried out a cross-sectional survey, analyzing prospective clinical and neuropathological data collected by the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC), comprising 589 brain samples from individuals with advanced HIV disease collected from 1999 onwards. We assessed gender, ethnicity/race, mode of transmission, age, year of death, nadir CD4, plasma viral load, last antiretroviral regimen, presence of parenchymal HIV brain pathology, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, and major depressive disorder. We compared cohort demographic variables with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention US HIV/AIDS statistics and examined associations of parenchymal HIV brain pathology with demographic, clinical, and HIV disease factors. With regard to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention US data, the NNTC was similar in age distribution, but had fewer females and African Americans and more Hispanics and men who have sex with men. Only 22% of the brains examined were neuropathologically normal. Opportunistic infections occurred in 1% to 5% of the cohort. Parenchymal HIV brain pathology was observed in 17.5% of the cohort and was associated with nadir CD4 and plasma viral load. Brains without parenchymal HIV brain pathology often had other noninfectious findings or minimal nondiagnostic abnormalities that were associated with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. Clinically, 60% of the cohort reported a lifetime episode of major depressive disorder and 88% had a HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. No pathological finding correlated with major depressive disorder. Both antiretroviral treatment regimen and elevated plasma HIV viral load were associated with presence of parenchymal HIV brain pathology; however, multivariate analyses suggest a stronger association with plasma viral load. The frequency of HIV brain pathology was lower than previous pre-antiretroviral reports, and was predicted by lower nadir CD4 and higher plasma viral load. Noninfectious pathologies and minimal changes correlated with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, suggesting a shift in pathogenesis from florid HIV replication to other, diverse mechanisms."
1206,0.005,1.0000,"The early diagnosis of pediatric HIV-1 infection is a critical issue in resource-limited settings to prioritize eligibility for antiretroviral therapy among HIV-1-infected children. A case-control study was performed within the ANRS 1201/1202 Ditrame Plus cohort (Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire) to assess the usefulness of CD4+ T-cell percentage (CD4%) and total lymphocyte count (TLC) measured early in life in African children born to HIV-1-infected mothers. Using plasma HIV-1 RNA testing at 4 weeks of life as gold standard, CD4% and TLC were determined at month 3 and 6 in all 33 children HIV-1-infected in utero or intrapartum/early postpartum (cases) born to mothers receiving peripartum antiretroviral prophylaxis. Controls were 66 HIV-1-uninfected children from the same cohort. At month 3, the median CD4% was significantly lower in HIV-1-infected children (17.7%, 95% percentiles, 7.1-27.4) than in uninfected controls (34.8%, 18.5-45.3) (P < 0.001). A comparable difference was also observed at month 6. At the same time points, no significant difference was measurable for TLCs. The best threshold differentiating HIV-infected and uninfected children at month 3 was 25% CD4+. Compared to HIV-1 RNA results, sensitivity of this marker was 87.1% (95% confidence interval, 70.2-96.4) at month 3 and 88.9% (70.8-97.6) at month 6. Specificity was 78.3% (63.6-89.0) and 88.3% (77.4-95.2), respectively. Early CD4% measurement allows one to classify adequately the vast majority of exposed children according to their HIV status. CD4% should be further evaluated under field conditions for the diagnosis of pediatric HIV-1 infection and the monitoring of pediatric antiretroviral therapy."

CD16+ monocyte prevalence was, however, elevated in patients not currently receiving antiretroviral therapy.

6817,0.005,1.0000,"The goal of antiretroviral therapy is clinical benefit through the suppression of viral replication and the immunologic reconstitution of HIV-1-infected patients. In spite of the availability of different highly active antiretroviral therapy only some patients sustain undetectable plasma viremia. We performed an observational study from October 1987 to February 2001 on immunologic and clinical outcome of 148 HIV-1-infected patients from an open clinical cohort at São Paulo University, Brazil. The median T CD4+ at starting first monitored regimen was 227 cells per microliter, with 65% of patients previously exposed to antiretroviral regimens, mostly dual therapy. Virologic response to antiretroviral therapy, after a median period of 179 weeks of monitored treatment, allowed classifying patients as aviremic (RNA plasma viremia below 500 copies per milliliter); viremic (current viral load at historic levels), and viremic-attenuated groups (detectable viremia, but > 1 log viral suppression). HIV RNA viral load, T CD4+ cells count, HIV-1 pol sequencing, inflammatory parameters, and clinical events were documented during a median follow-up of 251 weeks. This study observed better clinical and immunologic responses in the aviremic group, but the viremic-attenuated group showed a significant gain in CD4+ cells (p < 0.013) and a decreased number of cases progressing to an AIDS-defining clinical condition (p < 0.001) compared to the viremic group."
17474,0.005,1.0000,"Uncertainty has existed as to whether a T-cell deficiency exists in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection different from that inherent in the reduced T-cell numbers characteristic of the disease. Heretofore, methods for measuring T-cell responses in patients have been carried out with systems requiring monocytes as accessory cells. In the presence of high concentrations of interleukin-2, however, highly purified T cells respond in a monocyte-independent fashion to antibody reactive with the CD3 component of the antigen receptor complex Ti/CD3. Highly purified T cells of HIV-infected patients responded subnormally in this anti-CD3/IL-2 system, even in the case of patients who were asymptomatic or had only lymphadenopathy. The defective T-cell responses occurred over a wide range of concentrations of the anti-CD3. Neither poor IL-2 receptor function as reflected by responses to limiting dilutions of IL-2 nor IL-1 receptor function as defined by incremental proliferation when IL-1 is added accounted for this defect, which also correlated poorly with T4 and T8 numbers. These results suggested that the T-cell abnormality was closely related to Ti/CD3 function, was not specifically or restrictively associated with T4 cells, and was not due to defective IL-2- or IL-1-receptor functions. The amount of HIV RNA in 10(5) T lymphocytes from the patients amounted to less than that found in one cell of a standard HIV infected laboratory cell line (CEM), using slot-blot hybridization. Thus the T-cell deficiency we have observed was not likely to be due directly to cell killing by HIV resident in the T4 cells. Other factors may be important in inducing the immunodeficiency, some of which are discussed."

Using the proportional hazards model and multivariate analysis, lack of expression of coccidioidal delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) was found to be dependent on anergy in response to the non-coccidioidal antigens mumps, Trichophyton and Candida (relative hazard 4.2, 95% CI 1.8-9.8, P=0.001). Among subjects with CD4 lymphocyte counts >/=250 microl-1 on entry into the study, the in vitro lymphocyte transformation (LT) response to the coccidioidal antigen toluene spherule lysate was 4967+/-1652 (mean counts per minute (c.p.m.)+/-SEM) in subjects with coccidioidal DTH compared with 136+/-222 in those with negative DTH (P<0.001). However, amongst those whose CD4 count was <250 microl-1, LT responses were low and there was no significant difference based on coccidioidal DTH (P=0.965). Using the proportional hazards model and multivariate analysis, only a CD4 count <250 microl-1 was prognostically associated with the development of either active coccidioidomycosis or AIDS. These data indicate that immunodeficiency, particularly a CD4 lymphocyte count <250 microl-1, is the most important factor in the lack of expression of specific immunity to coccidioidomycosis and in the development of active coccidioidomycosis among HIV-infected individuals living in the coccidioidal endemic area."
2026,0.005,1.0000,"Direct recognition of viral gene sequences can be used to detect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in clinical specimens. A modification of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplification of gene sequences was used for detection of HIV-1-specific RNA prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The RNA served as a template for reverse transcriptase using primers derived from both the 3'ORF and the LTR regions of HIV-1, as well as from the control cellular sequences encoding beta-actin and T cell receptor. The resultant DNA was amplified with DNA polymerase. A transcriptional step using the bacteriophage T7 promoter recognition sequences, incorporated into the primers, was used to enhance the efficiency of the amplification process. This assay detects as few as 100 RNA copies of cloned HIV-1 genome. Starting with 1 microgram RNA isolated from PBMC, we were able to detect HIV-1 sequences in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic HIV-1 infection. The inclusion of T cell-specific primers permitted simultaneous evaluation of an immunologic parameter. The PCR can be applied to RNA samples for detection of viral and cellular sequences and is a rapid and efficient means for detection of HIV-1 sequences as well as potentially informative cellular sequences."

At enrollment and approximately every 4 months thereafter, participants were assessed for HIV seropositivity. As of December 1998, there were 133 HIV type 1 seroconversions and approximately 2,300 person-years of follow-up. Of the 133 observed seroconversions, specimens from 126 persons were available for subtyping (27 subtype B, 99 subtype E). In this analysis, the authors assessed differences in subtype-specific transmission while controlling for important risk factors. The methodology used accounts for left truncation, interval censoring, and competing risks as well as for time-varying covariates such as each IDU's history of reported frequency of injection and of incarceration. Using plausible epidemiologic assumptions and controlling for behavioral risks, the authors found that a significantly higher transmission probability was associated with subtype E compared with subtype B in this population. Since many epidemiologic, virologic, and host factors can influence HIV transmission, it was difficult to conclude whether these differences in transmission probabilities were due to biologic properties associated with subtype."
8991,0.005,1.0000,"Packaging of retroviral genomic RNA during virion assembly is thought to be mediated by specific interactions between the gag polyprotein and RNA sequences (often termed the psi or E region) near the 5' end of the genome. For many retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the portions of the gag protein and the RNA that are required for this interaction remain poorly defined. We have used an RNA gel mobility shift assay to measure the in vitro binding of purified glutathione S-transferase-HIV-1 gag fusion proteins to RNA riboprobes. Both the complete gag polyprotein and the nucleocapsid (NC) protein alone were found to bind specifically to an HIV-1 riboprobe. Either Cys-His box of NC could be removed without eliminating specific binding to the psi riboprobe, but portions of gag containing only the MA and CA proteins without NC did not bind to RNA. There were at least two binding sites in HIV-1 genomic RNA that bound to the gag polyprotein: one entirely 5' to gag and one entirely within gag. The HIV-1 NC protein bound to riboprobes containing other retroviral psi sequences almost as well as to the HIV-1 psi riboprobe."

When attempting to reproduce and extend these findings, we confirmed that VPA is able to stimulate HIV-1(IIIB) replication in acutely infected CEM and C8166 T lymphocytic cell lines and chronically infected ACH-2 and U937/IIIB/LAI cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The stimulatory effect of VPA on HIV replication in CEM cells was not increased by pretreatment of the cells with VPA for 24 hr before infection. However, we could not detect any stimulatory effect of VPA on HIV-1(IIIB) replication in acutely infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), MT-4, MT-2, HUT-78, and MOLT-4 (clone 8) cells and in chronically infected HUT-78/IIIB/LAI cells. The stimulatory effect by VPA under certain conditions (see above) may be ascribed to an enhanced HIV transcription, as VPA was found to enhance the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR)-directed expression of beta-galactosidase in transiently transfected HLtat, P4, and COS7 cells. VPA did not enhance beta-galactoside expression mediated by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. VPA did not affect HIV-induced syncytium formation. Nor had VPA any direct inactivating effect on HIV."
8844,0.005,1.0000,"Over the last decade, there was noted a large advancement of knowledge on living organisms and their products posing a potential occupational risk. Novel risk factors, often new to science, were identified, the role and significance of already known factors better comprehended, and occupational groups endangered by biological hazards more thoroughly recognized. Novel viruses and prions, emerging in different parts of the world, may pose a particular threat to health and life of health care workers, agriculture workers and veterinarians. A new coronavirus (SCoV) that evoked a rapid outbreak of disease described as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the first half of 2003 may serve as an example. The disease was particularly common among health care workers. Previously discovered zoonotic viruses, Nipah virus in pigs and Hendra virus in horses, may be a cause of fatal encephalitis in animal farmers. Hantaviruses (Puumala, Hantaan, Sin Nombre and others) infecting field rodents may be a cause of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in farmers and laboratory workers. Prions responsible for inducing a zoonotic variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) are considered to be a potential cause of work-related infections in agricultural and health care workers, however, this assumption has not as yet been supported by any conclusive evidence. In many countries, blood-borne occupational infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major epidemiological problem among health care workers, mostly because no vaccine against this virus has been produced to date. Vaccinations effectively restricted the number of occupational infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and work-related infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are very rare. Hazardous bioserosols, occurring in many work environments, pose an occupational health hazard of particular importance. Many new biological factors present in organic dusts that may induce work-related allergic and immunotoxic diseases among farmers and workers of the agricultural and wood industries have been identified. Droplet aerosols, which are generated from water, oils, oil-water emulsions and other liquids in various work environments, may contain infectious agents (Legionella spp.) as well as allergic and/or toxic agents. It has been shown that allergens and endotoxins produced by Gram-negative bacteria occurring in oil mist from metalworking fluids may cause occupational respiratory diseases in workers of the metallurgic industry."
9027,0.005,1.0000,"Because of limitations in the availability of data on primary care encounters, patient retention in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care is often estimated using laboratory measurement dates as proxies for clinical encounters, leading to possible outcome misclassification. This study included 83,041 HIV-infected adults from 14 clinical cohorts in the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD) who had ≥1 HIV primary care encounters during 2000-2010, contributing 468,816 person-years of follow-up. Encounter-based retention (REB) was defined as ≥2 encounters in a calendar year, ≥90 days apart. Laboratory-based retention (RLB) was defined similarly, using the dates of CD4-positive cell counts or HIV-1 RNA measurements. Percentage of agreement and the κ statistic were used to characterize agreement between RLB and REB. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations and stabilized inverse-probability-of-selection weights was used to elucidate temporal trends and the discriminatory power of RLB as a predictor of REB, accounting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, primary HIV risk factor, and cohort site as potential confounders. Both REB and RLB increased from 2000 to 2010 (from 67% to 78% and from 65% to 77%, respectively), though REB was higher than RLB throughout (P < 0.01). RLB agreed well with REB (80%-86% agreement; κ = 0.55-0.62, P < 0.01) and had a strong, imperfect ability to discriminate between persons retained and not retained in care by REB (C statistic: C = 0.81, P < 0.05). As a proxy for REB, RLB had a sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 77%, respectively, with misclassification error of 18%. "
11921,0.005,1.0000,"The genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) results from a combination of point mutations and genetic recombination, and rates of both processes are unusually high. This review focuses on the mechanisms and outcomes of HIV-1 genetic recombination and on the parameters that make recombination so remarkably frequent. Experimental work has demonstrated that the process that leads to recombination--a copy choice mechanism involving the migration of reverse transcriptase between viral RNA templates--occurs several times on average during every round of HIV-1 DNA synthesis. Key biological factors that lead to high recombination rates for all retroviruses are the recombination-prone nature of their reverse transcription machinery and their pseudodiploid RNA genomes. However, HIV-1 genes recombine even more frequently than do those of many other retroviruses. This reflects the way in which HIV-1 selects genomic RNAs for coencapsidation as well as cell-to-cell transmission properties that lead to unusually frequent associations between distinct viral genotypes. HIV-1 faces strong and changeable selective conditions during replication within patients. The mode of HIV-1 persistence as integrated proviruses and strong selection for defective proviruses in vivo provide conditions for archiving alleles, which can be resuscitated years after initial provirus establishment. Recombination can facilitate drug resistance and may allow superinfecting HIV-1 strains to evade preexisting immune responses, thus adding to challenges in vaccine development. These properties converge to provide HIV-1 with the means, motive, and opportunity to recombine its genetic material at an unprecedented high rate and to allow genetic recombination to serve as one of the highest barriers to HIV-1 eradication."
19818,0.005,1.0000,"Plasma viral load (VL) values and CD4(+) cell count are employed clinically for initiation of therapy in the treatment of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as previous clinical studies have shown a marked prevalence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) development in seropositive individuals with VL values over 30 000 copies/mL. Many studies have shown that reduced glutathione (GSH) and cysteine (Cys) deficiency play an important role in the infection. We have developed capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)-based assays and have used them to investigate the relationship between plasma and intracellular thiol levels and HIV-1 viremia in plasma. Blood samples from healthy volunteers and seropositive patients undergoing different antiretroviral regimes were analyzed in the study. The VL assay was based on CZE-UV detection of viral RNA at 260 nm. Determination of endogenous reduced Cys and GSH was achieved by CZE-UV detection of their mercurial complexes at 200 nm. We found that a decrease in GSH and Cys levels may be associated with disease progress. In fact, reduced GSH and Cys levels appear progressively reduced with increasing VL."
8479,0.005,1.0000,"Nucleotide sequences in three hypervariable regions of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) env gene were obtained by sequencing provirus present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-infected individuals. Single molecules of target sequences were isolated by limiting dilution and amplified in two stages by the polymerase chain reaction, using nested primers. The product was directly sequenced to avoid errors introduced by Taq polymerase during the amplification process. There was extensive variation between sequences from the same individual as well as between sequences from different individuals. Interpatient variability was markedly less in individuals infected from a common source. A high proportion of amino acid substitutions in the hypervariable regions altered the number and positions of potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Sequences in two hypervariable regions frequently contained short (3- to 15-bp) duplications or deletions, and by amplifying peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA containing 10(2) or 10(3) proviral molecules and analyzing the product by high-resolution electrophoresis, the total number and abundance of distinct length variants within an individual could be estimated, providing a more comprehensive analysis of the variants present than would be obtained by sequencing alone. Sequences from many individuals showed frequent amino acid substitutions at certain key positions for neutralizing-antibody and cytotoxic T-cell recognition in the immunodominant loop. The rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution in the region of this and flanking regions indicate that strong positive selection for amino acid change is operating in the generation of antigenic diversity."
13572,0.005,1.0000,"Neurocognitive disorders are emerging, probably underestimated, complications in HIV-infected people. The aim of the study was to assess neurocognitive profiles of newly detected HIV-infected patients. We performed an observational retrospective single-cohort study. Illiterates and patients with neurologic symptoms or previous psychiatric diagnosis were excluded. Neuropsychological profiles were assessed using a validated battery of neuropsychological tests. We included 206 patients; with males representing the majority of them (85%). Risk factors for HIV acquisition were unprotected sexual intercourse (homo/bisexual in 39.8% and heterosexual in 60.2%). Thirty-nine patients (18.9%) were previous injection drug users, while 41 (19.9%) were alcohol abusers. Mean education was 11.1 years (SD--standard deviation--3.7). A high prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND, 47.1%) was present in HIV-infected patients: particularly, asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI) was found in 30.6%, mild neurocognitive disorder (MND) in 15% and HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in 1.5%. Male gender, low degree of education, AIDS diagnosis and gepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection were factors independently associated with HAND in a multivariable logistic regression model. Our data suggest that patient-specific factors and AIDS diagnosis have a certain kind of impact in HAND occurrence. A complete neuropsychological screening must be recommended in all patients at HIV-infection diagnosis."
4536,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of our study was to monitor the diversity of HIV-1 strains circulating in Hungary and investigate the prevalence of resistance-associated mutations to reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR) inhibitors in newly diagnosed, drug-naive patients. A total of 30 HIV-1-infected patients without prior antiretroviral treatment diagnosed during the period 2008-2010 were included into this study. Viral subtypes and the presence of RT, PR resistance-associated mutations were established by sequencing. Classification of HIV-1 strains showed that 29 (96.6%) patients were infected with subtype B viruses and one patient (3.3%) with subtype A virus. The prevalence of HIV-1 strains with transmitted drug resistance mutations in newly diagnosed individuals was 16.6% (5/30). This study showed that HIV-1 subtype B is still highly predominant in Hungary and documented a relatively high transmission rate of drug resistance in our country."
6033,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and characteristics of HIV drug resistance mutations among antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive and ART-experienced patients in South Korea. A total of 50 ART-naive and 34 ART-experienced Korean HIV-1-infected patients who visited an urban hospital from February 2007 to March 2011 were included. Most patients (86.9%) were infected with clade B HIV-1. Six (12%) ART-naive and 22 (64.7%) ART-experienced patients had HIV strains with resistance mutations. Among ART-naive patients, V179D was the most common mutation, being found in five ART-naive patients. Among ART-experienced patients, M184V was the most common mutation. Eight of 34 ART-experienced patients had thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs). The prevalence of drug-resistant HIV-1 in ART-naive patients was higher than in previous reports, and 50% of patients with virologic failure harbored strains with multiple resistance mutations. HIV drug resistance testing should be recommended to guide therapy of ART-naive patients in South Korea."
5595,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this cross-sectional study was to analyse the prevalence of HIV-1 drug-resistance mutations among HIV-1-infected prison inmates in Spain. Treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients with an HIV RNA viral load of >/=2,000 copies/ml were included. To ensure that the study population was representative of the entire HIV-infected Spanish inmate population, a two-stage conglomerate for selection of the sample was used. In the first stage, 15 prisons were randomly selected, and in the second stage, 38 patients (30 treatment-experienced and 8 treatment-naive) per centre were randomly selected. Genotyping was performed by automatic sequencing. Resistance testing was performed on viral strains from 184 inmates from 12 prisons. Valid sequences were obtained from 133 inmates (90 treatment-experienced and 43 treatment-naive inmates). Most (92.5%) were men and had acquired HIV infection by intravenous drug use (91%); their mean age was 35 years. One or more key resistance mutations were detected in 5 (11.6%) treatment-naive and in 35 (38.6%) treatment-experienced patients. Among treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was found in 3 (6.9%) and in 20 (22.2%) patients, respectively, resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in 3 (6.9%) and in 21 (23.3%) patients, and resistance to protease inhibitors in 3 (6.9%) and in 14 (15.5%) patients. Multidrug resistance was detected in 1 of the 43 (2.3%) treatment-naive patients. These findings support the use of resistance testing in HIV-infected inmates who must begin antiretroviral therapy, given the high rate of primary resistance to drugs frequently included in the initial treatment regimens."
19599,0.005,1.0000,The aims of this study were to assess hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroconversion and to determine its impact on the natural course of the disease in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) during lamivudine (LMV) treatment. A total of 183 consecutive patients with HBeAg-negative CHB who were treated with LMV were included in the study. Data were retrospectively collected from outpatient visit charts. The primary endpoint was HBsAg seroconversion to anti-HBs. The secondary endpoint was to determine the development of cirrhosis. Loss of HBsAg was confirmed in 10 patients and seroconversion to anti-HBs in nine patients during LMV treatment or after its discontinuation. HBsAg seroconversion was achieved on-treatment in four patients after a median treatment duration of 30 months and off-treatment in the remaining five patients in a median 61 months after LMV discontinuation. The cumulative probability of HBsAg seroconversion increased from 0.6% at 1 year and 1.9% at 5 years to 21.5% at 10 years of LMV during and after LMV treatment. HBsAg clearance was preceded by undetectable serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA. The majority of the patients responding to treatment had undetectable HBV DNA levels at 24 weeks of treatment. The cumulative probability of LMV resistance increased from 2.2% at 1 year to 37.3% at 5 years. No baseline parameter predicting either HBsAg seroconversion or the emergence of LMV resistance was identified. None of the patients with HBsAg seroconversion experienced virological breakthrough or disease progression during the follow-up period. These results indicate that HBsAg seroclearance can occur in patients with HBeAg-negative CHB under LMV therapy and predicts better clinical outcome.
17032,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates from 50 plasma specimens were analyzed for phenotypic susceptibility to licensed reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors by the Antivirogram and PhenoSense HIV assays. Twenty of these specimens were from recently seroconverted drug-naïve persons, and 30 were from patients who were the sources of occupational exposures to HIV-1; 16 of the specimens in the latter group were from drug-experienced patients. The phenotypic results of the Antivirogram and PhenoSense HIV assays were categorized as sensitive or reduced susceptibility on the basis of the cutoff values established by the manufacturers of each assay. Data for 12 to 15 drugs were available by both assays for 38 specimens and represented a total of 529 pairs of results. The two data sets had a 91.5% concordance by phenotypic category. The discordant results (n = 45) were distributed randomly among 26 specimens and included 28 results (62.2%) which were within a twofold difference of the assay cutoff values. None of the discordant results were associated with primary resistance mutations that predicted high-level (>20-fold) resistance. Discordant results were distributed equally among specimens from drug-experienced and drug-naïve individuals and were slightly higher for protease inhibitors than for nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The findings of the present study demonstrate that the results of the Antivirogram and PhenoSense HIV assays correlate well, despite the use of different testing strategies."
19216,0.005,1.0000,"Emergence of drug-resistant mutant viruses during the course of antiretroviral therapy is a major hurdle that limits the success of chemotherapeutic treatment to suppress human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication and AIDS progression. Development of new drugs and careful patient management based on resistance genotyping data are important for enhancing therapeutic efficacy. However, identifying changes leading to drug resistance can take years of clinical studies, and conventional in vitro assays are limited in generating reliable drug resistance data. Here we present an efficient in vitro screening assay for selecting drug-resistant variants from a library of randomly mutated HIV-1 strains generated by transposon-directed base-exchange mutagenesis. As a test of principle, we screened a library of mutant HIV-1 strains containing random mutations in the protease gene by using a reporter T-cell line in the presence of the protease inhibitor (PI) nelfinavir (NFV). Analysis of replicating viruses from a single round of infection identified 50 amino acid substitutions at 35 HIV-1 protease residue positions. The selected mutant viruses showed specific resistance to NFV and included most of the known NFV resistance mutations. Therefore, the new assay is efficient for identifying changes leading to drug resistance. The data also provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of drug resistance."
10906,0.005,1.0000,"This study, through a phylogenetic analysis, is aimed to identify potential epidemiological networks and sequence interrelationships between acute/early and chronic infections in both drug-naïve and drug-experienced individuals within a local, well-defined setting and to investigate the population dynamics of transmitted resistance and the potential contribution of untreated patients to the spread of antiretroviral resistance. A total of 884 HIV-1 B subtype pol gene sequences from 306 drug-naïve (40 recently and 266 chronically infected) and 578 drug-treated HIV-1 infected patients were collected through routine drug-resistance testing between 2000 and 2008 in a single center (Division of Infectious Disease, Bergamo, Northern Italy). Bayesian phylogenetic tree was reconstructed and transmission clusters were recognized using a posterior probability as statistical support of each cluster. Differences among clustered and non-clustered drug-resistance mutations were assessed by Fisher's exact test. In our cohort we identified five clusters including ≥6 sequences with the root posterior probability of 100%. Dated phylogenies reconstructed through Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo model was possible for only two main clade (≥10 sequences) originated between 1990 and 2002. Among the 306 drug-naïve individuals, 12% carried a viral strain with at least 1 major mutation associated with transmitted drug resistance and 36% of these strains were involved in significant clusters. We report for the first time that many (34%) of HIV-1 subtype B transmission clusters identified in Italy were only composed by drug-naïve individuals and that the 14% of transmitted drug resistance was linked to transmission clusters composed only of newly diagnosed individuals. The phylogenetic analysis was performed on a large cohort of drug-naïve recently/chronically infected individuals where drug-experienced patients represent almost all infected individuals in a restricted geographical area. Our findings highlight the role of newly diagnosed individuals, not yet exposed to antiretroviral drugs, in the transmission of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains, providing new insights for the planning and management of treatment programs in developing countries."
9,0.005,1.0000,"Conventional highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection typically use nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and either a protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Because PI-based regimens are associated with significant long-term toxicity and adherence difficulty, there is a need for novel regimens that maximize combination treatment options. This 12-month, observational, cohort study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a novel three-drug HAART regimen. Drug treatment consisted of nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), and didanosine (ddl). Twenty-six treatment-naive and -experienced HIV-1+ men and women were included in the study. Assessment consisted of CD4+ cell count, plasma HIV-1 RNA load, and adverse effects of study medications. After one year of therapy, 11/12 treatment-naive subjects (92%) and 8/9 treatment-experienced subjects (89%) had viral loads < 400 copies/mL. Both groups also had an excellent immune response. At one year, there was a mean increase of 438 CD4+ cells/mm3 among treatment-naive subjects and 367 cells/mm3 among treatment-experienced subjects. Treatment-limiting adverse effects occurred in 3/15 treatment-naive (20%) and 2/11 treatment-experienced (18%) subjects. These preliminary data suggest that the combination of NVP, EFV, and ddl is simple, safe, and effective."
13743,0.005,1.0000,"Turkey is seeing a steady rise in rates of HIV infection in the country. The number of individuals with HIV/AIDS was greater than 7000 in 2014 according to data released by the Ministry of Health, and heterosexual contacts were reported to be the main transmission routes. Istanbul has the highest number of reported cases of HIV infection. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance in 50 heterosexual patients from Istanbul. The most prevalent subtype was found to be subtype B (56.2 %). Resistance-associated mutations were found in 14 patients with 6/14 patients being therapy-experienced and 8/14 therapy naive at the time point of analysis. With increasing number of patients who require treatment and the rapid up-scaling of the antiretroviral therapy in Turkey, HIV-1 drug resistance testing is recommended before starting treatment in order to achieve better clinical outcomes."

Seven haemophiliacs, coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), received 9 mega-units (MU) of natural IFN-alpha daily during the first 2 weeks and then three times a week for 22 weeks, all injected subcutaneously. Six patients were receiving zidovudine (AZT) 600 mg day-1 and didanosine (ddI) 200 mg day(-1) during IFN therapy. This treatment was safe and well tolerated. Four patients had no detectable serum HCV-RNA at the end of therapy, but long-term, none of the seven patients achieved a sustained response, i.e. undetectable serum HCV-RNA with persistently normal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 6 months after therapy. IFN did not affect CD4-positive cell counts. Most of our patients had high HCV-RNA loads and/or low CD4 counts, both unfavourable markers for IFN therapy. In conclusion, IFN therapy did not eradicate HCV from haemophiliacs coinfected with HIV."
12215,0.005,1.0000,"S-1153 is a new imidazole compound that inhibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) replication by acting as a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). This compound inhibits replication of HIV-1 strains that are resistant to nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. S-1153 has a 50% effective concentration in the range of 0.3 to 7 ng/ml for strains with single amino acid substitutions that cause NNRTI resistance, including the Y181C mutant, and also has potent activity against clinical isolates. The emergence of S-1153-resistant variants is slower than that for nevirapine, and S-1153-resistant variants contained at least two amino acid substitutions, including F227L or L234I. S-1153-resistant variants are still sensitive to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine. In a mouse and MT-4 (human T-cell line) in vivo HIV replication model, S-1153 and AZT administered orally showed a marked synergy for the inhibition of HIV-1 replication. S-1153 shows a significant accumulation in lymph nodes, where most HIV-1 infection is thought to occur. S-1153 may be an appropriate candidate for two-to three-drug combination therapy for HIV infection."
13296,0.005,1.0000,"A longitudinal study was conducted to evaluate the viral shedding present in cervicovaginal secretions of HIV-1-seropositive women receiving antiretroviral therapy. A total of 128 paired cervicovaginal and blood samples was obtained from 37 women during a median follow-up period of 21 months. A sensitive, competitive, polymerase chain reaction and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were used for the simultaneous quantitation of HIV-1 proviral DNA and RNA in cervicovaginal cells and cell-free RNA in cervicovaginal secretions, as well as HIV-1 RNA in peripheral blood. The cumulative probability of detecting proviral DNA in genital secretions was significantly higher over time in women with detectable viremia than in women in whom HIV-1 RNA was persistently undetectable in plasma (< 50 copies/ml) (P = 0.028 by log-rank test). The presence and amount of proviral DNA, cell-associated RNA and cell-free RNA in the cervicovaginal secretions were positively correlated with the presence of detectable viremia or the number of HIV-1 RNA copies in plasma (Spearman rank correlation, 0.290, 0.279, and 0.305, respectively; all P < 0.01), but no correlation was found with the CD4+ cell count. In addition, vaginal infections were positively correlated with the detection of proviral DNA in cervicovaginal secretions (odds ratio, 2.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-5.70). However, the positive correlation between the presence and amount of HIV in cervicovaginal secretions and the viral load in plasma provides no assurance that HIV shedding does not occur in the genital tract of women with undetectable HIV-RNA in plasma."
13776,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) account for millions of cases of vertical infections worldwide. Laboratory diagnosis is essential for the detection of potentially infectious carriers. HBeAg represents the best serological marker for HBV replication. Since 10% of HBeAg-negative carriers transmit the virus to their children, determination of viral DNA is more reliable for the assessment of the risk to vertical infection. Risk assessment of vertical HIV transmission and monitoring AZT therapy during pregnancy are achieved by determination of HIV-1 viral load and CD4+ cell count. HIV-1 RNA or cDNA detection permits a nearly 100% sensitive diagnosis of congenital HIV infection already 2 weeks after birth. While qualitative HBV DNA determination should be limited only to anti-HBe carriers in order to assess infectiosity, HIV-1 RNA measurement represents in combination with the CD4+ cell count the best prognostic marker for vertical HIV infection and for the follow-up of infected children."
11651,0.005,1.0000,"To develop an animal model for the therapy of AIDS with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors, we recently constructed a hybrid simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/HIV-1 in which the RT gene of SIV was replaced by the RT gene of HIV-1. This chimaeric virus, designated RT-SHIV, was found to be markedly sensitive to the inhibitory effects of both nucleoside (ddN) and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs). In contrast, SIV was inhibited only by ddNs (i.e., 3TC and AZT), but not NNRTIs. When RT-SHIV was grown in the presence of 3TC, nevirapine, TSAO-m3T or the thiocarboxanilide UC-42 drug-resistant mutant virus strains emerged in cell culture as rapid as for HIV-1(IIIB). The antiviral sensitivity/resistance spectrum of the mutant RT-SHIV strains against NNRTIs and ddNs, and the nature of the mutations that appeared in their RT were similar to those of the mutant HIV-1 strains that were selected under identical experimental conditions. Infection of macaques with RT-SHIV may be a useful tool for studying the mechanism of NNRTI-resistance development and the therapy of NNRTI-resistant viruses in an animal model."

The homozygous HLA-G -14-bp genotype is associated with higher viral load (P = .004), lower CD4 cell count (P = .01), and increased mortality (hazard ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.033-3.522; P = .04) compared with HLA-G +14-bp carriers."
1334,0.005,1.0000,"Although discontinuation of suppressive antifungal therapy for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated histoplasmosis is accepted for patients with immunologic recovery, there have been no published studies of this approach in clinical practice, and minimal characterization of individuals who relapse with this disease. We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study to determine the outcome in AIDS patients following discontinuation of suppressive antifungal therapy for histoplasmosis. Ninety-seven patients were divided into a physician-discontinued suppressive therapy group (PD) (38 patients) and a physician-continued suppressive therapy group (PC) (59 patients). The 2 groups were not statistically different at baseline, but at discontinuation of therapy and at the most recent follow-up there were significant differences in adherence to therapy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA, and urinary Histoplasma antigen concentration. There was no relapse or death attributed to histoplasmosis in the PD group compared with 36% relapse (p < 0.0001) and 5% death (p = 0.28) in the PC group. Relapse occurred in 53% of the nonadherent patients but not in the adherent patients (p < 0.0001). Sixty-seven percent of patients with initial central nervous system (CNS) histoplasmosis relapsed compared to 15% of patients without CNS involvement (p = 0.0004), which may be accounted for by nonadherence. In addition, patients with antigenuria above 2.0 ng/mL at 1-year follow-up were 12.82 times (95% confidence interval, 2.91-55.56) more likely to relapse compared to those with antigenuria below 2.0 ng/mL. Discontinuation of antifungal therapy was safe in adherent patients who completed at least 1 year of antifungal treatment, and had CD4 counts >150 cells/mL, HIV RNA <400 c/mL, Histoplasma antigenuria <2 ng/mL (equivalent to <4.0 units in second-generation method), and no CNS histoplasmosis."
3148,0.005,1.0000,"Dental care of HIV-positive individuals plays a vital role in improving their nutritional intake, medication tolerance and effectiveness, treatment success rate, and quality of life. It is therefore important to ensure optimal dental care of this group of people, especially since more of them, with or without knowledge of their serologic status, are now utilizing dental services. The objective of this study was to assess Nigerian dental students' willingness to treat HIV-positive individuals. A descriptive cross-sectional survey of all seventy-six final-year dental students of the University of Benin, Nigeria, was conducted in December 2007 using a self-administered questionnaire that elicited information on the students' demography, self-rated knowledge on HIV/AIDS, attitude towards homosexuals, infection control practices, occupational risk perception, and willingness to provide care for HIV-positive individuals. The response rate was 76.3 percent. Over 77 percent of the respondents were in the twenty-five to thirty years age group. The male-female ratio was approximately 1.6:1. HIV-related knowledge was reported as high by only 31 percent of the respondents. Eighty-one percent showed great interest in HIV-related information, while about half (53.4 percent) exhibited significant worry about occupational contagion. Forty-eight (82.7 percent) desired more knowledge about safety precautions during treatment of HIV patients. Fifty respondents (86.2 percent) reported good infection control practices. About three-fourths (74.2 percent) rated the risk of HIV contagion from patients high, while only one-fourth (25.8 percent) reported having an unsympathetic attitude towards homosexuals. Almost all respondents (98.3 percent) agreed that oral care for HIV-positive individuals improves their quality of life, but only 58.8 percent expressed a willingness to treat HIV-positive patients and only 46.5 percent said they will render volunteer dental services in HIV centers. HIV prevalence will determine the location of practice of 41.4 percent of the respondents. The result suggests the need to have a comprehensive educational/motivational program for the next generation of dentists in Nigeria in order to ensure adequate care of HIV-positive individuals. The perceived deficiency revealed in this study can also serve as a vital guide for curriculum change on HIV-related issues."
7517,0.005,1.0000,"Cases of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection acquired from transfusion of screened antibody-negative blood have been reported since 1986. Recent reports have proposed new combination antibody assays or the addition of HIV-1 p24 antigen testing to enhance the screening of blood donations further. Since antibody testing for HIV-1 began in 1985, 700,000 donor units have been screened at US Army blood donor centers. The US Army blood donor/recipient ""lookback"" program recently identified two cases of HIV-1 infection that resulted from a screened negative donation. Samples from the implicated unit, as well as from previous donations from the same donor, were available for testing to assess the performance of current screening methods. Sequential donation samples were assayed by five different Food and Drug Administration-approved HIV-1 screening enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, a Food and Drug Administration-approved Western blot, a recombinant envelope-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, a p24 antigen capture assay, a radioimmunoprecipitation assay, and a polymerase chain reaction. The HIV-1 p24 antigen and genomic RNA material were detected in a donation that was screened as negative by four of the five Food and Drug Administration-licensed screening enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Two recipients of transfusion products from this donation became infected with HIV-1. A sample from a prior donation from this donor was negative for HIV-1 by all assays. The status of blood donors who are in the early stages of HIV-1 infection may not be detected by current screening methods. While this is a rare phenomenon, it highlights the need for technologic developments in screening methods to narrow the time between infection and detection. In addition, it emphasizes the need for more effective education and counseling to enhance the utility of self=deferral."
17248,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human pegivirus (HPgV), formerly GBV-C, are the only known human viruses in the Hepacivirus and Pegivirus genera, respectively, of the family Flaviviridae. We present the discovery of a second pegivirus, provisionally designated human pegivirus 2 (HPgV-2), by next-generation sequencing of plasma from an HCV-infected patient with multiple bloodborne exposures who died from sepsis of unknown etiology. HPgV-2 is highly divergent, situated on a deep phylogenetic branch in a clade that includes rodent and bat pegiviruses, with which it shares <32% amino acid identity. Molecular and serological tools were developed and validated for high-throughput screening of plasma samples, and a panel of 3 independent serological markers strongly correlated antibody responses with viral RNA positivity (99.9% negative predictive value). Discovery of 11 additional RNA-positive samples from a total of 2440 screened (0.45%) revealed 93-94% nucleotide identity between HPgV-2 strains. All 12 HPgV-2 RNA-positive cases were identified in individuals also testing positive for HCV RNA (12 of 983; 1.22%), including 2 samples co-infected with HIV, but HPgV-2 RNA was not detected in non-HCV-infected individuals (p<0.0001), including those singly infected by HIV (p = 0.0075) or HBV (p = 0.0077), nor in volunteer blood donors (p = 0.0082). Nine of the 12 (75%) HPgV-2 RNA positive samples were reactive for antibodies to viral serologic markers, whereas only 28 of 2,429 (1.15%) HPgV-2 RNA negative samples were seropositive. Longitudinal sampling in two individuals revealed that active HPgV-2 infection can persist in blood for at least 7 weeks, despite the presence of virus-specific antibodies. One individual harboring both HPgV-2 and HCV RNA was found to be seronegative for both viruses, suggesting a high likelihood of simultaneous acquisition of HCV and HPgV-2 infection from an acute co-transmission event. Taken together, our results indicate that HPgV-2 is a novel bloodborne infectious virus of humans and likely transmitted via the parenteral route. "

13752,0.005,1.0000,"In mid-1988 a postal survey was conducted of one in five general practitioners in England and Wales, to examine their contact with people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or with worries about HIV infection or AIDS. The response rate was 63.9%. Of the 3339 respondents 22.7% knew of an asymptomatic HIV positive patient within their practice, 5.4% knew of a symptomatic HIV positive patient and 6.4% knew of a patient with AIDS. The estimated annual rate for HIV-related consultations in general practice (including consultations with the 'worried well') was 6.5 per 1000 population. HIV-related consultations occurred more frequently in the four Thames health regions than elsewhere. A sample of 715 practitioners who reported consultations with HIV infected people or those with worries about infection in the previous month, were invited to keep a diary of HIV-related consultations for one week. The response rate to the diary was 64%. Nineteen per cent of the 273 consultations recorded in the diaries were initiated by homosexual men, 16.5% by injecting drug users, 10.3% by the sexual partners of people at risk of infection; 42.9% of consultations were not associated with recognized risk factors. The results indicate that general practitioners have substantial contact with patients with HIV infection, with AIDS and with worries about HIV infection or AIDS. This contact is likely to increase, alongside the anticipated spread of HIV infection, with consequent implications for general practice resources."
19448,0.005,1.0000,"A 40-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was referred for evaluation of abnormal liver enzyme activities. The patient was maintained on antiretroviral therapy for HIV as well as medication to suppress HBV and had previously undergone treatment for HCV with durable sustained virologic response. The patient was clinically well without any symptoms or evidence of liver decompensation. Laboratory findings were notable for aminotransferase activities in the 200 to 225 U/L range that had been persistent for several months. An extensive workup for the etiology of the aminotransferase elevation ensued. Imaging studies showed no evidence of biliary obstruction. Serology revealed negative autoantibodies, negative serum HCV-RNA, and low level HBV-DNA by polymerase chain reaction. Further testing revealed positive hepatitis delta virus (HDV) antibody and positive HDV RNA in the serum. A percutaneous liver biopsy was performed to further elucidate the cause of the elevated aminotransferase activities. Based on histology, serology, and clinical presentation, a diagnosis of chronic HDV infection was made. HDV infection should be considered in patients with known chronic viral hepatitis B with low viral load, who present with worsening liver function or elevation in aminotransferase activities."
10645,0.005,1.0000,"Although several studies have reported that it is safe to discontinue secondary Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis in patients infected with HIV who experience a sustained immune response as a result of antiretroviral therapy, we describe a patient who developed recurrent PCP <3 months after discontinuing trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis. He developed disease despite a sustained CD4 T-cell count above 200 cells/microL for more than 3 years while on antiretroviral therapy, as well as an apparent immune reconstitution against disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and Histoplasma capsulatum, for which he also discontinued therapy but without adverse effects. Thus, although increasing evidence continues to indicate that HIV-infected patients receiving combinations of antiretroviral therapies may regain specific immunity against opportunistic infections, our patient's experience suggests that this immune recovery may be selective and incomplete."
2883,0.005,1.0000,"Over 850 Leishmania-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection cases have been recorded, the majority in Europe, where 7 to 17% of HIV-positive individuals with fever have amastigotes, suggesting that Leishmania-infected individuals without symptoms will express symptoms of leishmaniasis if they become immunosuppressed. However, there are indirect reasons and statistical data demonstrating that intravenous drug addiction plays a specific role in Leishmania infantum transmission: an anthroponotic cycle complementary to the zoonotic one has been suggested. Due to anergy in patients with coinfection, L. infantum dermotropic zymodemes are isolated from patient viscera and a higher L. infantum phenotypic variability is seen. Moreover, insect trypanosomatids that are currently considered nonpathogenic have been isolated from coinfected patients. HIV infection and Leishmania infection each induce important analogous immunological changes whose effects are multiplied if they occur concomitantly, such as a Th1-to-Th2 response switch; however, the consequences of the viral infection predominate. In fact, a large proportion of coinfected patients have no detectable anti-Leishmania antibodies. The microorganisms share target cells, and it has been demonstrated in vitro how L. infantum induces the expression of latent HIV-1. Bone marrow culture is the most useful diagnostic technique, but it is invasive. Blood smears and culture are good alternatives. PCR, xenodiagnosis, and circulating-antigen detection are available only in specialized laboratories. The relationship with low levels of CD4+ cells conditions the clinical presentation and evolution of disease. Most patients have visceral leishmaniasis, but asymptomatic, cutaneous, mucocutaneous, diffuse cutaneous, and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis can be produced by L. infantum. The digestive and respiratory tracts are frequently parasitized. The course of coinfection is marked by a high relapse rate. There is a lack of randomized prospective treatment trials; therefore, coinfected patients are treated by conventional regimens. Prophylactic therapy is suggested to be helpful in preventing relapses."
14419,0.005,1.0000,"While orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has become the treatment of choice for most irreversible end-stage liver diseases, its role in patients with hepatitis B (HBV) infection is controversial. A high risk of reinfection of the transplanted graft, associated with significant morbidity and mortality, has been reported. Although passive and active immunization can delay reappearance of the virus in the allograft, there is not yet an effective therapy for recurrent HBV infection in liver transplant recipients. Between October 1985 and March 25, 1991, 28 OLT in 25 patients with acute and chronic HBV infections were performed. Twelve of the patients were HBV DNA-negative, six were HBV DNA-positive, and seven were not tested prior to transplantation. Only the 19 patients surviving more than 100 days after transplantation were considered to have sufficient duration of follow-up (mean 734 days; range 500-1545) to include in analysis of recurrence. Five (26%) were free of recurrent disease at the time of last follow-up (mean 1031 days, range 526 to 1770 days. Recurrent HBV in the allograft, as defined by positive immunoperoxidase stains of biopsy sections for viral antigens, was detected in 74% (13 male, 1 female; 7 Asian, 7 white) at a mean of 134 days posttransplantation. Histological changes of viral hepatitis, first appearing an average of 157 days (range 95-326) posttransplantation, were evident in 13 of 14 with positive immunostaining. Twelve of the 14 patients were treated, on an open trial basis, with intravenous and oral prostaglandin E (PGE) because of deteriorating clinical condition. Eleven of the twelve responded to PGE with an initial drop in serum transaminases, improvement in coagulopathy and resolution of encephalopathy. One patient failed to respond and died of a myocardial infarction within 9 days of institution of therapy. Three of the eleven patients with an initial response relapsed and died in liver failure as a direct result of recurrent HBV after 13, 16, and 37 days of treatment in association with generalized sepsis. Eight of the 12 patients (67%) had a sustained favorable response to PGE therapy (mean follow-up 737 days, range 403-1545). All patients with a sustained response had accompanying improvement in histology and reduction in viral antigen staining in hepatocytes. Treatment with PGE appeared to be of benefit in recurrent HBV infection of the transplanted liver with an initial response rate of 92% and a sustained response rate of 67%."
3398,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is prevalent in Chinese populations. 40.4% of 383 Chinese HBV carriers studied were HBeAg-positive. The annual rate of spontaneous clearance of HBeAg was 11%. Twenty-six patients with HBsAg- and HBeAg- and HBeAg-positive non-malignant chronic liver disease randomised to receive recombinant alpha-2 interferon or no treatment have been followed for 6 months or longer. Seven of the 20 treated patients cleared HBeAg during or shortly after treatment but this was sustained in only 1 patient. One of the 6 controls had transient loss of HBeAg. It is too early to conclude whether interferon has any long-term effect on the suppression of HBV replication in Chinese patients. Sixty-nine patients with histologically proven hepatocellular carcinoma were randomised to receive adriamycin or interferon. Although there was no significant benefit on survival, interferon therapy was associated with greater than 25% regression in tumor size in 12.5% of patients and less toxicity."
7752,0.005,1.0000,"With over 1 million people living with HIV, the US faces national challenges in HIV care delivery due to an inadequate HIV specialist workforce and the increasing role of non-communicable chronic diseases in driving morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients. Alternative HIV care delivery models, which include substantial roles for advanced practitioners and/or coordination between specialty and primary care settings in managing HIV-infected patients, may address these needs. We aimed to systematically review the evidence on patient-level HIV-specific and primary care health outcomes for HIV-infected adults receiving outpatient care across HIV care delivery models. We identified randomized trials and observational studies from bibliographic and other databases through March 2016. Eligible studies met pre-specified eligibility criteria including on care delivery models and patient-level health outcomes. We considered all available evidence, including non-experimental studies, and evaluated studies for risk of bias. We identified 3605 studies, of which 13 met eligibility criteria. Of the 13 eligible studies, the majority evaluated specialty-based care (9 studies). Across all studies and care delivery models, eligible studies primarily reported mortality and antiretroviral use, with specialty-based care associated with mortality reductions at the clinician and practice levels and with increased antiretroviral initiation or use at the clinician level but not the practice level. Limited and heterogeneous outcomes were reported for other patient-level HIV-specific outcomes (e.g., viral suppression) as well as for primary care health outcomes across all care delivery models. No studies addressed chronic care outcomes related to aging. Limited evidence was available across geographic settings and key populations. As re-design of care delivery in the US continues to evolve, better understanding of patient-level HIV-related and primary care health outcomes, especially across different staffing models and among different patient populations and geographic locations, is urgently needed to improve HIV disease management."
823,0.005,1.0000,"South America is considered to have a low prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, although areas with a relatively high prevalence have been identified in northern Brazil. Few epidemiological studies of populations at risk of HBV infection are available for this region. Given this, in the present study, we investigated the prevalence of HBV and the factors associated with infection among illicit drug users (DUs) in the Marajó Archipelago, northern Brazil. In this cross-sectional study, we collected samples and epidemiological information from DUs in 11 municipalities of the Marajó Archipelago. The diagnosis was established by ELISA and real-time PCR; and genotyping was done by multiplex real-time PCR. Statistical modeling was based on simple and multiple logistical regressions with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The mean age of the 466 DUs was 28.4 years, and most were male. The most-consumed illicit drugs were crack cocaine and marijuana. In all, 171 DUs were exposed to HBV, with genotypes A, D and F being identified. The factors associated with higher frequencies of HBV infection were (i) male gender, (ii) age above 35 years, (iii) anti-HIV positivity, (iv) tattoos, (v) the use of injected drugs, (vi) the use of illicit drugs for more than 3 years, (vii) sexual relations without protection, (viii) sexual relations with another DU, and (ix) more than 10 sexual partners in the past 24 months. In summary, this study provides important insights into the dynamics of HBV infection among DUs in the Marajó Archipelago. We hope that these findings will contribute to the development of strategies, actions and public health policies aimed at preventing and controlling this viral infection more effectively."
10196,0.005,1.0000,"Knowledge of an HIV-infected individual's sexual behaviors and routine sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) testing greatly facilitates HIV prevention efforts, but current data in older individuals are lacking. This study was developed to compare sexual behaviors and STD prevalence between older HIV-infected individuals and their younger counterparts. We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study of HIV-infected individuals > or =18 years who completed an annual behavioral assessment. A total of 541 individuals completed the assessment. Analyses were performed to examine differences in sexual behaviors and STD prevalence between age groups: younger (18-35 years) (30%), middle-aged (36-49 years) (46%), and older (> or =50 years) (24%). Older individuals were most likely to be male and Caucasian with longest time since HIV diagnosis, greatest receipt of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and highest rates of HIV RNA <50 copies/mL (all p<0.001). Reports of recent sexual activity decreased with age, younger (56%) vs. middle-aged (43%) vs. older (27%) (p<0.001). The median number of recent sex partners was one (range 1-25) and 68% overall reported using condoms consistently; these parameters did not differ by age group. STD prevalence was 8% (gonorrhea [9], chlamydia [7], and syphilis [20]) and was highest among younger individuals (younger [11%] vs. middle-aged [7%] vs. older [3%]). Our results demonstrated that with older age, sexual activity declines but inconsistent condom use remains commonly reported. Furthermore, STDs were identified among all age groups. This latter finding reinforces the need for secondary prevention efforts among all individuals living with HIV/AIDS."
16059,0.005,1.0000,"Lamivudine is effective in inhibiting hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication, and its clinical use in patients with chronic hepatitis B is associated with improvements in serum aminotransferase levels and liver histopathologic characteristics. Few data are available on its use in patients with advanced liver disease. We report on the outcomes of 5 patients with hepatic decompensation caused by chronic hepatitis B treated long term with lamivudine. All patients were adult white men seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) before therapy. All 5 patients had biopsy-proven cirrhosis with clinical and biochemical evidence of hepatic decompensation. Two patients had Child's class C cirrhosis; 2 patients, class B; and 1 patient, class A (although this patient had persistent portasystemic encephalopathy and developed variceal bleeding). HBV DNA became undetectable in all patients and remained so throughout the study. Both patients with Child's class C and 1 patient with class B cirrhosis had significant clinical improvement. Child-Pugh scores improved from 12 to 7 and 11 to 7 in the 2 patients with Child's class C cirrhosis, and the patient with class B cirrhosis had complete resolution of troublesome encephalopathy. Serum aminotransferase, albumin, and total bilirubin levels improved significantly in 3 of 5 patients. One patient with Child's class B cirrhosis underwent orthotopic liver transplantation at week 13 after dramatic increases in liver tests and clinical worsening. The patient subsequently cleared HBeAg and HBsAg from serum posttransplantation. In conclusion, prolonged therapy with lamivudine resulted in improved serum biochemical values and loss of HBV DNA in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Clinical improvements, reflected in Child-Pugh classification and functional status, may also occur, particularly among those with Child's class C disease initially."

18810,0.005,1.0000,"Twenty-four patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), antibody to hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe), HBV DNA positivity, and alanine transaminase (ALT) elevation who failed previous interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) therapy were included in a pilot study of combination therapy with ribavirin and IFN-alpha. The patients received daily oral ribavirin (1,000-1,200 mg according to body weight) plus 5 million units (MU) IFN-alpha2b three times a week for 12 months and were followed-up for 12 months. The median viremia level decreased significantly at the end of treatment (1.2 x 10(3) copies/mL) and follow-up (4.0 x 10(2) copies/mL) compared with the baseline (3.0 x 10(6) copies/mL; P <.05). After 12 months, 8 of 24 (33%) patients had cleared HBV DNA and 12 (50%) had normal ALT levels. At the end of the study virological and biochemical response was 50% and 21%, respectively. Thus, virological and biochemical response sustained in 5 of 24 (21%) patients retreated with ribavirin and IFN-alpha; none of them lost hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Liver histology improved in 2 of 4 sustained responders but in none of the 12 nonresponders with paired biopsies (P =.05). The response was independent of dose and duration of previous treatment, viral load, or the distribution of HBV precore wild-type/mutant variants. However, sustained responders had significantly higher necroinflammation (P =.036) and fibrosis (P =.007) scores. IFN-alpha-related side effects were mild and reversible on discontinuation. In 4 (17%) patients who suffered nausea and diarrhea the ribavirin dosage was reduced by 50% after 1 month of therapy and finally discontinued in all of them. No patient had liver disease decompensation. In summary, combination therapy with ribavirin and IFN-alpha may be efficacious to treat viremic anti-HBe-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B who have failed previous IFN therapy."
17645,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the leading cause of cirrhosis worldwide. One effective strategy to prevent recurrence or transmission of HBV infection after liver transplantation exists is prescription of Lamivudine, although it is associated with high resistance rates. Adefovir dipivoxil (AD) is a nucleotide analogue of adenosine that has achieved significant results in virologic, biochemical, and clinical parameters in lamivudine-resistant HBV-infected patients. Between 1990 and 2003 7 adult recipients of orthotopic liver transplants who experienced lamivudine-resistant HBV infection (pretransplantation or posttransplantation) were enrolled in a prospective study to administer AD for 48 weeks. At baseline they showed serum HBV DNA between 2.2 x 10(6) and 1.1 x 10(8) copies/mL. After 48 weeks of AD treatment, the median time-weighted average change in serum HBV DNA (log 10 copies/mL) was -3.19 (SD, 1.65). In 3 patients with HBV, DNA was undetectable (<400 copies/mL) at the end of the follow-up. HBe antigen seroconversion was observed in 1 patient. No significant adverse effects were recorded, except for renal functional impairment in 1 patient who had previous renal insufficiency. In our study, adefovir was an effective drug to suppression HBV replication in liver transplant recipients with lamivudine-resistant HBV. Excluding renal function abnormalities, tolerance of the drug was excellent. None of the patients developed resistance to adefovir. Therapy with AD in liver transplant recipients is effective and safe, although renal function should be monitored closely."
9421,0.005,1.0000,"Fifty-seven patients with chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis B virus (HBV) e antigen (HBeAg) and HBV DNA positivity, and aminotransferase elevation despite a previous course of any type of adequate interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) therapy were included in a multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial. The objective of the study was to compare a second course of IFN-alpha therapy (9 million units [MU] of IFN-alpha-2a, Roferon-A, thrice weekly for 6 months) versus no therapy in terms of loss of HBV DNA and HBeAg. At the end of the study, a sustained clearance of HBV DNA and HBeAg was observed in 9 of the 27 (33.3%) patients who had received retreatment with IFN-alpha compared with 3/30 (10%) patients who spontaneously cleared these markers in the untreated control group (chi2 = 4.66, P =.031; odds ratio: 4.5, 95%; confidence interval: 1.1-18.9). None of the responders lost HBsAg. Patients retreated with IFN-alpha were more likely to have biochemical remission in association with HBV clearance (5/27, 18.5%) compared with untreated patients (1/30, 3. 3%; Fisher's exact test P =.09 ). Histological improvement in the liver necroinflammatory activity was observed among sustained responders to IFN-alpha retreatment, consisting of regression of the portal and periportal inflammation and of the piecemeal necrosis; there was no change in the degree of liver fibrosis. Side effects were similar to those previously reported during IFN-alpha treatment; these were mild and reversible on IFN-alpha discontinuation. None of the baseline features were associated with response by Cox's regression analysis. In summary, viremic patients with chronic HBeAg-positive hepatitis may experience disease remission following retreatment with IFN-alpha. Thus, retreatment with IFN-alpha may be considered a therapeutic option."
14269,0.005,1.0000,"Liver transplantation for cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) has a poor prognosis. This is primarily a consequence of the near universal reinfection of the allograft, subsequent accelerated hepatic disease while receiving immunosuppression, and a reduced long-term survival. Because interferon-alpha has been shown to have an antiviral effect on HBV, a study was initiated in 1986 to assess the effect of interferon-alpha therapy on the course of liver transplantation in HBV-positive recipients. Twenty-eight patients with decompensated endstage liver disease caused by HBV were treated with 5, 2.5 or 1.25 million units (MU) of human recombinant interferon-alpha 2b (r-IFN-alpha 2b) daily for a minimum of 14 days prior to transplantation and continuing for 42 days post-transplantation. HBV antigens, HBV antibodies, HBV DNA and serum transaminase levels were measured throughout the treatment and post-treatment period. HBV DNA was eliminated in 10 of 19 patients, who survived 3 months or more post-transplantation, and was associated with a significant flare of hepatitis as detected by symptoms and transaminase levels (P < 0.05). Patients who cleared HBV DNA had lower HBV DNA levels (P < 0.05) at entry compared with those who did not. While four of 10 patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) converted to hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), no surviving patient cleared hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) on a long-term basis. Nonetheless, post-transplant survival was significantly better (P < 0.0001, median follow-up 42 months) in the IFN-alpha treated patients as compared with historical controls, and was similar to that of patients transplanted for all causes of parenchymal liver disease other than HBV cancer. Hence IFN-alpha therapy in the perioperative liver transplantation period improves short-term survival but does not prevent HBV infection of the allograft."
16499,0.005,1.0000,"Historically, hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been considered species specific and unable to infect baboons. Based on this premise, two patients with HBV endstage liver disease underwent baboon liver xenotransplantation. To study whether baboons are susceptible to HBV infection, four baboons (two receiving immunosuppressive therapy) were inoculated with HBV. Animals were followed for 6 months: clinical examinations and biochemical studies were normal, hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antigen staining of biopsies was negative, and HBV serology remained negative. HBV polymerase chain reaction was transiently positive in one animal, which most likely reflects the initial inoculation. This pilot study corroborates historical evidence and beliefs that baboons are resistant to HBV."
12889,0.005,1.0000,"Decompensated liver disease associated with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common indication for liver transplantation. It was shown previously that greater pretransplantation HCV titers are associated with relatively poor patient and graft survival. The tolerability and efficacy of antiviral therapy in patients with decompensated liver disease are not known. We conducted a pilot study to determine the likely tolerability and efficacy of pretransplantation antiviral therapy with interferon alfa-2b, with or without ribavirin. HCV RNA-positive patients at or near the top of their respective waiting lists were randomly assigned to one of three treatment regimens until the time of liver transplantation: (1) group A, interferon alfa-2b, 1 x 10(6) U/d; (2) group B, interferon alfa-2b, 3 x 10(6) U three times weekly; or (3) group C, interferon alfa-2b, 1 x 10(6) U/d, plus ribavirin, 400 mg twice daily. Less than half the patients screened met entry criteria, with thrombocytopenia and leukopenia the most common reasons for exclusion. Fifteen patients were administered antiviral therapy; three patients in group A and six patients each in groups B and C. Loss of detectable HCV RNA was seen in 33% of patients, whereas 55% had a decrease in viral titers on therapy. Twenty-three adverse events occurred, including 20 serious adverse events. Thrombocytopenia was the most common adverse event. Two infectious complications occurred; one of these had a fatal outcome. We conclude that although pretransplantation antiviral therapy may reduce HCV titers in a minority of patients who meet treatment initiation criteria, adverse events associated with therapy are frequent and often severe in patients with Child's class B and C cirrhosis."
6379,0.005,1.0000,"One thousand and eighty-one evaluable HIV-infected patients were assessed for pancreatic abnormalities in a prospective case-control study including the whole follow-up period of each patient (minimum 12 months). The 435 patients (40.2%), who experienced at least one episode of confirmed pancreatic laboratory abnormality had a longer duration of seropositivity, exposure to protease inhibitors, a more frequent immunodeficiency, AIDS, chronic liver and/or biliary disease and hypertriglyceridaemia, while no relation was found with antiretroviral administration, and the duration of type of nucleoside analogues, when compared with the 646 controls. High and prolonged laboratory alterations eventually associated with signs of organ involvement occurred in 166 cases (38.2%), and were related to the administration of didanosine, stavudine, lamivudine, pentamidine, cotrimoxazole or antitubercular/antimycobacterial therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, illicit substance or alcohol abuse, opportunistic infections, chronic liver and/or biliary disease, a protease inhibitor-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and hypertriglyceridaemia (usually associated with HAART administration). No difference was noticed between the 46 patients with clinical and/or imaging evidence of pancreatic involvement and the 120 asymptomatic subjects. Although recurrences of enzyme alterations involved 69.6% of patients, only in 30.1% of cases did a change of the underlying antiretroviral or antimicrobial therapy become necessary. An acute, uncomplicated pancreatitis occurred in nine of the 46 symptomatic subjects (19.6%). A two to four week gabexate and/or octreotide administration (performed in 79 cases of 166, 47.6%), achieved a significant laboratory, clinical and imaging cure or improvement in 82.3% of cases, with a better success rate of combined (gabexate mesilate plus octreotide) vs. single (gabexate mesilate or ocreotide) therapy. Reduced disease recurrences and a better tolerability of antiretroviral regimens, were also noticed."
18720,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has emerged as an important etiologic agent of liver injury and failure in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The prevalence and characteristics of HCV in a representative cohort of HIV-infected patients have not been described. Therefore, a representative sample of 1687 HIV-infected patients was studied; a 213-sample subcohort was selected by use of risk-based sampling from 2 large prospective US Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group clinical trials. HCV prevalence, HCV RNA level, and genotype were determined. The weighted overall estimate of HCV prevalence in the study cohort was 16.1% (95% weighted confidence interval, 14.3%-17.8%), with significant variability depending on risk factors and HIV RNA levels. Among patients defined as being ""at risk"", 72.7% were HCV positive, whereas, among low-risk patients, the positivity rate was 3.5%. Genotype 1 was found in 83.3% of infected patients. Median HCV RNA level was 6.08x106 IU/mL. High virus loads and genotype 1 prevalence may be important to interferon-based antiviral response rates among coinfected patients."
16148,0.005,1.0000,"Individuals who are homozygous for the 32-bp deletion in the gene coding for the chemokine receptor and major human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor CCR5 (CCR5 -/-) lack functional cell surface CCR5 molecules and are relatively resistant to HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 infection in CCR5 -/- individuals, although rare, has been increasingly documented. We now report that the viral quasispecies from one such individual throughout disease is homogenous, T cell line tropic, and phenotypically syncytium inducing (SI); exclusively uses CXCR4; and replicates well in CCR5 -/- primary T cells. The recently discovered coreceptors BOB and Bonzo are not used. Although early and persistent SI variants have been described in longitudinal studies, this is the first demonstration of exclusive and persistent CXCR4 usage. With the caveat that the earliest viruses available from this subject were from approximately 4 years following primary infection, these data suggest that HIV-1 infection can be mediated and persistently maintained by viruses which exclusively utilize CXCR4. The lack of evolution toward the available minor coreceptors in this subject underscores the dominant biological roles of the major coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4. This and two similar subjects (R. Biti, R. Ffrench, J. Young, B. Bennetts, G. Stewart, and T. Liang, Nat. Med. 3:252-253, 1997; I. Theodoreu, L. Meyer, M. Magierowska, C. Katlama, and C. Rouzioux, Lancet 349:1219-1220, 1997) showed relatively rapid CD4+ T-cell declines despite average or low initial viral RNA load. Since viruses which use CXCR4 exclusively cannot infect macrophages, these data have implications for the relative infection of the T-cell compartment versus the macrophage compartment in vivo and for the development of CCR5-based therapeutics."
7222,0.005,1.0000,"From a prospective cohort study, 24 asymptomatic men were identified who had been antibody positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for at least 5 years (median = 9.1) with CD4+ lymphocyte counts greater than or equal to 400 cells/mm3. Of these ""nonprogressors"", 23 (96%) had evidence of HIV infection by either HIV culture or the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV DNA, although only 1 (4%) had a positive assay for HIV RNA (by PCR) and no one was positive for p24 antigen. Compared with 24 antibody-negative men and 14 men with AIDS, nonprogressors had higher CD8+ counts and lower natural killer cell activity. Nonprogressors had higher beta 2-microglobulin levels than did seronegative controls, suggesting some degree of immune system activation. Compared with men with AIDS, nonprogressors seemed to have a stronger antibody response to six different HIV-related proteins but did not differ significantly in neutralizing antibody or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic activity."
8847,0.005,1.0000,"A retrospective analysis of 99 hepatitis B-positive homosexual men with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status was conducted to study the interaction of concurrent HIV infection on the course of their chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. All 99 subjects had chronic hepatitis B, 43 of whom were HIV antibody negative and 56 of whom were HIV antibody positive at the time of their initial presentation. Serial serum aminotransferase levels were used as an indirect estimate of the severity of hepatic inflammation. Factors that may influence the course of hepatitis B, HIV status, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)/hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb) status, alcohol intake, and zidovudine (AZT) therapy were correlated with aminotransferase values. Overall, there was no difference in mean serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels between HIV antibody-negative and HIV antibody-positive patients. There is a higher prevalence rate of HBeAg in HIV antibody-positive patients (p < 0.05), and the seroconversion rate from HBeAg to HBeAb was lower in HIV antibody-positive patients compared with HIV antibody-negative patients (p < 0.05). However, reactivation rates from HBeAb to HBeAg were no different in the HIV antibody-positive and negative hepatitis B carriers. With mild, moderate, or heavy alcohol intake, we observed no statistically significant difference in mean serum alanine aminotransferase levels and no mean serum aspartate aminotransferase levels between HIV antibody-negative patients versus HIV antibody-positive patients. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the pattern of serum aminotransferase in those subjects treated with or without AZT. The mortality rates were higher in HIV antibody-positive patients (n = 8) compared with in HIV antibody-negative patients (n = 2). Seventy-five percent (n = 6) of the HIV antibody-positive patients died from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and overall only two patients died of liver disease, one in each group. We conclude that there is no overt influence by HIV or the treatment thereof on the course of chronic HBV infection in a population of homosexual men. In HIV-infected patients, death from AIDS predominated; hence, the main target for therapy should be HIV rather than HBV."
14791,0.005,1.0000,"Lamivudine has been shown to prevent de novo hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in liver transplantation (LT) patients receiving hepatitis B core antibody-positive (HBcAb(+)) grafts, but it may produce long-term resistance. Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) might be effective in preventing de novo hepatitis and resistance. A single-center, prospective trial was conducted with 16 adults (10 men and 6 women, mean age = 54 ± 11 years) who underwent LT with HBcAb(+) grafts between September 2007 and October 2009. After LT, patients were given ADV [10 mg daily (adjusted for renal function)]. No hepatitis B immune globulin was administered. At LT, all graft recipients were hepatitis B surface antigen-negative (HBsAg(-)), 38% were surface antibody-positive (HBsAb(+)), and 50% were HBcAb(+). The median follow-up after LT was 1.8 years (range = 1.0-2.6 years). All recipients had undetectable HBV DNA (<40 IU/mL) after LT until the end of follow-up. One recipient (6%) who was HBsAb(-) and HBcAb(-) before LT became HBsAg(+) after 52 weeks. One recipient was switched from ADV to entecavir for chronic renal insufficiency, and 19% of the patients had renal dose adjustments. There was a nonsignificant trend of increasing creatinine levels over time (1.2 mg/dL at LT, 1.3 mg/dL 1 year after LT, and 2.0 mg/dL 2 years after LT, P = 0.27). A comparison with a control cohort of LT recipients with hepatitis C virus who did not receive ADV showed no difference in the creatinine levels at LT or 1 year after LT. In conclusion, ADV prophylaxis prevents HBV replication in recipients of HBcAb(+) livers but does not fully protect recipients from de novo HBV. Long-term follow-up is needed to better determine the risk of de novo infection."
16199,0.005,1.0000,"Coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important and preventable cause of chronic liver disease among HIV-infected patients. We calculated the prevalence of chronic HBV infection annually from 1996 to 2007 by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and HIV transmission risk in a multisite observational cohort study of HIV-infected patients. Prevalence of chronic HBV infection was calculated as the number of patients with a positive HBsAg or detectable HBV DNA divided by the number of patients tested using either one of these assays. Among 4467 (59%) patients tested for chronic HBV infection from a total of 7618 patients active during 1996-2007, median age was 38.5 years, 77% were men, 49% were white, 35% were black, 13% were Hispanic, and 53% were men who had sex with men (MSM). Overall, 8.4% tested positive for HBsAg or detectable HBV DNA. Annual chronic HBV prevalence during 1996-2007 ranged from 7.8% to 8.6% without a statistically significant trend. Overall, prevalence was greater among men compared with women; among whites, blacks, and persons of other race compared with Hispanics; among MSM compared with injection drug users and high-risk heterosexuals; and among patients aged 35-44 years compared with younger or older patients. MSM constituted the greatest fraction (63-72%) of all HBV-infected patients in the HIV Outpatient Study (HOPS) over the period. Of eligible patients, 5.8%, 23.4%, and 31.6% had received at least one dose of HBV vaccine by years 1996, 2002, and 2007, respectively. Despite the availability of an effective HBV vaccine for over two decades and long-standing recommendations for immunization of persons (with or without HIV infection) at risk for HBV, the prevalence of chronic HBV infection in this study has been largely unchanged over the past decade among patients in all groups, and overall was 20 times as high as the national population prevalence."
17869,0.005,1.0000,"CD4+ lymphocytes are a primary target of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and CD4 counts are one of the factors used to measure disease progression in HIV-positive individuals. CD4 counts vary in uninfected individuals and across populations due to a variety of demographic, environmental, immunological and genetic factors that probably persist throughout the course of HIV infection. This study sought to determine reference levels and identify factors that influence lymphocyte counts in 681 HIV-uninfected adults in Senegal, where residents are exposed to a variety of infectious diseases and other conditions that may affect CD4 counts. Lymphocyte counts were assessed in commercial sex workers, symptomatic men and women presenting to the University of Dakar infectious disease clinic for out-patient care and women seeking family planning services. CD4 and CD3 lymphocyte counts differed between the four study groups (P < 0.01). Men had the lowest mean CD4 count (711.6 cells/microl), while commercial sex workers had the highest levels (966.0 cells/microl). After adjustment for age and other behavioural and clinical factors, the difference in CD4 counts between the three groups of women did not remain. However, both gender and smoking were associated independently with CD4 counts, as men maintained lower mean CD4 counts (beta = -156.4 cells/microl, P < 0.01) and smokers had higher mean CD4 counts (beta = 124.0 cells/microl, P < 0.01) than non-smokers in multivariable analyses. This study is the first to explore factors that may influence CD4 levels in Senegal and to estimate baseline CD4 levels among HIV-negatives, information that may guide clinicians in interpreting CD4 counts."
6735,0.005,1.0000,"Quantitative determination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA concentration is the most important measure for an estimation of the infectivity of an HBV positive health care worker and the basis for the decision whether he or she is allowed to perform exposure prone procedures. Thus questions are raised on how reliable quantitative HBV DNA assays are, and how stable is the HBV DNA concentration is in a healthy chronic HBV carrier. Therefore, in the present study two commercially available quantitative HBV DNA assays, the Amplicor HBV Monitor and the HBV Test Hybrid Capture II, and an ""in house"" quantitative HBV TaqMan PCR, analysing 101 sera of HBsAg positive patients for HBV DNA were compared. In addition, HBV DNA concentrations were followed in 14 healthy chronic carriers for up to 6 years. Despite a good overall correlation between the three tests considerable differences were found for the results of individual sera. Fifty-one percent of sera showed differences within one order of magnitude, 45% differed by a factor above 10 and 4% even by a factor of 100 and higher. The follow-up of the HBV DNA concentrations in 14 carriers showed in 7 carriers a rather stable course with variations within one order of magnitude, whereas in the other half the DNA concentrations fluctuated by factors between 10(2) and 10(6) over the observation period. Thus, viral load determinations in health care workers have to be interpreted with some caution, especially when they are the basis of far-reaching decisions."
12897,0.005,1.0000,"In order to determine the prevalence of risk behaviour for, and antibodies to HIV and hepatitis B in clients of a needle-exchange scheme in central London we employed an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire along with salivary antibody testing by immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody capture immunoassay. Two hundred and thirty-two subjects (193 men, 39 women; median age 32) participated; a response rate of 89%. Clients were long-term, frequent injectors. Lending used equipment at any time was reported by 55%, and borrowing by 52%. Of those who had shared needles and syringes during the last year, the majority had lent to, or borrowed from, one person only (53 and 55%, respectively). Younger clients (less than 29 years of age) reported more recent sharing than older clients (greater than 30 years of age). Five out of 211 (2.4%) samples tested for anti-HIV were positive. One hundred and eleven out of 199 (56%) samples were positive for anti-hepatitis B core (HBc). In this population of needle-exchange attenders there is no evidence of further spread of HIV, and a low prevalence of HIV infection appears to have been sustained. However, the high prevalence of anti-HBc provides evidence of previous risk behaviour and so constant vigilance is necessary if further viral spread is to be avoided. This study has established an acceptable method for the anonymous surveillance of current risk behaviour and salivary antibodies to HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in a drug-using population."
959,0.005,1.0000,"Despite recent clinical guidelines recommending early initiation and widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), many HIV-infected individuals are not receiving ART-in particular low-income, minority substance users. Few studies have examined psychological, as opposed to structural, factors related to not receiving ART in this population. Perceived capacity to tolerate physical and psychological distress, known as distress tolerance (DT), may be a particularly relevant yet understudied factor. The current study tested the relationship between self-reported physical and psychological DT and ART receipt among predominantly low-income, minority HIV-infected substance users (n=77). Psychiatric disorders, biological indicators of health status, ART use, structural barriers to health care, and self-reported physical and psychological DT were assessed. 61% of participants were receiving ART. The only factors that distinguished individuals not on ART were greater avoidance of physical discomfort, higher psychological DT, and higher CD4 count. Both DT measures remained associated with ART use after controlling for CD4 count and were associated with almost a two-fold decrease in likelihood of ART receipt. Current findings suggest higher perceived capacity to tolerate psychological distress and greater avoidance of physical discomfort are important factors associated with lower ART use among substance users and may be important intervention targets."
18188,0.005,1.0000,"Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) incidence with HIV infection may have increased with the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), suggesting that immune reconstitution may contribute to some cases. We evaluated HL risk with cART during the first months of treatment. With 187 HL cases among 64 368 HIV patients in France, relative rates (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of HL were estimated using Poisson models for duration of cART, CD4 count, and HIV load, with and without adjustment for demographic/clinical covariates. HL risk was unrelated to cART use overall, but it was related to time intervals after cART initiation (P = .006). Risk was especially and significantly elevated in months 1-3 on cART (RR 2.95, CI 1.64-5.31), lower in months 4-6 (RR 1.63), and null with longer use (RR 1.00). CD4 count was strongly associated with HL risk (P < 10⁻⁶), with the highest HL incidence at 50-99 CD4 cells/mm³. With adjustment for CD4 count and covariates, HL risk was elevated, but not significantly (RR 1.42), in months 1-3 on cART. HIV load had no added effect. HL risk increased significantly soon after cART initiation, which was largely explained by the CD4 count. Further studies of HIV-associated HL are needed."
17007,0.005,1.0000,"Since potent HIV protease inhibitor drugs became widely available in early 1996, many HIV clinical specialists have noted a marked decrease in the occurrence of AIDS-related opportunistic infections, and some specialists have reported unusual clinical presentations and manifestations of previously common opportunistic infections. In this article, we will review (1) the available data regarding recent trends in AIDS-related opportunistic infections incidence and manifestations, (2) clinical and immunologic evidence that potent combination antiretroviral therapy can alter the natural history of these opportunistic infections, and (3) the implications of these findings for current patient management practice and future clinical and immunologic research. As a preface to this review, however, it is important to acknowledge that any evaluation of the potential benefit of potent combination antiretroviral therapy in reducing the risk of serious opportunistic infections can be confounded by the concomitant use of prophylactic antimicrobial agents co-administered to prevent specific opportunistic infections. For example, it is standard clinical practice to administer trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (or another agent if trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole cannot be tolerated) to patients with an absolute CD4 lymphocyte count < 200 cells/microliters, unexplained chronic fever or a history of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Similarly, specific antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection in patients with absolute CD4 counts < 50 cells/microliters is also a widely recommended guideline. Although the relative efficacies of specific antimicrobial prophylaxis regimens in preventing the most common life- and sight-threatening opportunistic infectious complications of AIDS [Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), disseminated MAC infection, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis] are now well established, these relative efficacies were established in the era before potent combination antiretroviral therapies became available and may not be generalizable to the current era. Nevertheless, for perspective, the reported efficacies of prophylaxis for PCP, disseminated MAC infection, and CMV end-organ disease are summarized in Table 1."
14963,0.005,1.0000,"In both clinical trials and clinical practice, nonadherence to medications is widespread among patients with chronic diseases. The shift to combination therapies for treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals has increased adherence challenges for both patients and health-care providers. Estimates of average rates of nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy range from 50% to 70%. Adherence rates of <80% are associated with detectable viremia in a majority of patients. The principal factors associated with nonadherence appear to be patient-related, including substance and alcohol abuse. However, other factors may also contribute, such as inconvenient dosing frequency, dietary restrictions, pill burden, and side effects; patient-health-care provider relationships; and the system of care. We discuss the major reasons reported by HIV-infected individuals for not taking their medications. Improving adherence probably requires clarifying the treatment regimen and tailoring it to patient lifestyles."
6444,0.005,1.0000,"Nevirapine (NVP) is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor widely used in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus disease. To establish its safety profile, we conducted a review of data from prospective US and international clinical trials involving a total of 906 adult patients and 468 pediatric patients treated with NVP. Drug-related adverse events were similar in adults and children, with rash and nausea most frequently reported in adults and rash and granulocytopenia most frequently reported in children. A separate analysis of rash based on data from adult patients in controlled trials demonstrated a 16% rate of NVP-attributable rash in these patients. Of patients with NVP-associated rash, 65% developed rash within the first 6 weeks of therapy, and it has been shown that a lower lead-in dose (200 mg/d vs the standard 400 mg/d) for the first 2 weeks of NVP treatment reduces the frequency of drug-associated rash. Serious rash (Stevens-Johnson syndrome [SJS] or SJS/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome) occurred with an incidence of 0.3% and clinical hepatitis with an incidence of 1.0% among NVP-treated patients in clinical trials. Adverse event data from long-term clinical trials demonstrated a lower incidence of NVP-related adverse events than in short-term trials of NVP therapy. An analysis of abnormal laboratory findings using thresholds similar to those found in the prescribing information for other commonly used antiretroviral agents and data from controlled trials in adults showed that the most frequently observed laboratory abnormalities were elevations in liver function test results. Approximately 50,000 patients in the United States had been treated with marketed NVP at the time of writing, and postmarketing surveillance has supported the overall safety profile observed in clinical trials. NVP has been shown to be well tolerated in both adult and pediatric patients."
14933,0.005,1.0000,"As increasing numbers of persons are placed on potentially life-saving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in sub-Saharan Africa, it is imperative to identify the psychosocial and social factors that may influence antiretroviral (ARV) medication adherence. Using an 87 question survey, the following data were collected from patients on cART in Botswana: demographics, performance (Karnofsky) score, perceived stigma and level of HIV disclosure, attitudes and beliefs concerning HIV/AIDS, substance and/or drug use, depression, and pharmacy and healthcare provider-related factors. Overall adherence rates were determined by patient self-report, institutional adherence, and a culturally modified Morisky scale. Three hundred adult patients were recruited between April and May 2005. The overall cART adherence rate was 81.3% based on 4 day and 1 month patient recall and on clinic attendance for ARV medication refills during the previous 3 months. Adults receiving cART for 1-6 months were the least adherent (77%) followed by those receiving cART for greater than 12 months (79%). Alcohol use, depression, and nondisclosure of positive HIV status to their partner were predictive of poor adherence rates (p value <0.02). A significant proportion (81.3%) of cART-treated adults were adherent to their prescribed treatment, with rates superior to those reported in resource-rich settings. Adherence rates were poorest among those just starting cART, most likely due to the presence of ARV-related toxicity. Adherence was lower among those who have been treated for longer periods of time (greater than 1 year), suggesting complacency, which may become a significant problem, especially among these long-term cART-treated patients who return to improved physical and mental functioning and may be less motivated to adhere to their ARV medications. Healthcare providers should encourage HIV disclosure to ""at-risk"" partners and provide ongoing counseling and education to help patients recognize and overcome HIV-associated stigma, alcohol abuse, and depression."
2326,0.005,1.0000,"Sustained viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy improves clinical outcomes for HIV-infected individuals. Study M05-730 evaluated the long-term antiviral activity, safety, tolerability, emergence of resistance, and compliance with once-daily (QD) versus twice-daily (BID) lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) combination therapy in treatment-naïve, HIV-1-infected subjects through 96 weeks. Antiretroviral-naïve subjects with HIV-1 RNA levels >1000 copies/ml were randomized to LPV/r QD (N = 333) or BID (N = 331) with tenofovir DF and emtricitabine. Through 96 weeks, 77 subjects from each group discontinued prematurely; adverse or HIV-related events contributed to discontinuation of 36 subjects overall, with no significant differences between treatment groups. At 96 weeks, 216 QD subjects (64.9%) and 229 BID subjects (69.2%) had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml (p = 0.249) by intent-to-treat analysis. Evaluation of the time to virologic failure indicated that 85.0% and 80.7% of QD and BID subjects, respectively, maintained virologic suppression through 96 weeks (p = 0.638). QD subjects demonstrated greater adherence levels. There were no significant differences in virologic response when subjects were analyzed according to baseline disease state. Emergence of postbaseline resistance mutations occurred at similar low rates in each dosing group. Diarrhea was the most common moderate-to-severe drug-related adverse event reported; the most common Grade 3+ laboratory abnormalities were elevations of total cholesterol and triglycerides, occurring with similar incidence regardless of LPV/r dosing frequency. QD dosing of LPV/r was associated with similar durability of viral suppression and low rates of genotypic resistance and treatment-limiting adverse events as compared with BID dosing in treatment-naïve subjects through 96 weeks of treatment."
4353,0.005,1.0000,"In newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), standard lymphoma regimens yield approximately a 50% complete response (CR) rate and an overall median survival of < or = 9 months. Treatment results of relapsed patients are extremely poor. Regimens that appear more effective than standard therapy have usually been investigated only in patients with relatively high CD4 counts. An exception is a regimen consisting of a continuous 96-hour infusion of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (CDE). A 62% CR rate was achieved in 21 patients with a median CD4 count of 87/microL, and the median overall survival was 18 months. In another study of 25 patients, didanosine (ddI) was added to CDE and was shown to cause less myelosuppression without compromising efficacy. Other studies suggest that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can be combined with intensive chemotherapy regimens, with improved efficacy attributed to less frequent dosage reduction of chemotherapeutic agents. More recently, autologous and syngeneic bone marrow transplantation have been explored in a handful of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related NHL with promising results. Data on whether widespread use of HAART decreases the incidence of HIV-positive NHL are conflicting. Some clues from recent studies suggest we are close to an answer: (1) protease inhibitors significantly improve survival of HIV-positive patients with NHL; (2) only one of eight recent cases of HIV-positive men with NHL received HAART compared with greater than 70% of HIV-positive men free of NHL; and (3) no prior HAART independently predicted for AIDS-related NHL development. On the other hand, Hodgkin's disease may be increasing in frequency in HIV-positive patients as the incidence of NHL declines. It is hypothesized that more effective reconstitution of the immune system with HAART may facilitate the inversion of these incidences. Future prospective studies will hopefully answer these questions."
10818,0.005,1.0000,"In HIV-1-infected individuals the CD8+ T cell subset is considerably expanded. This has been shown to be caused predominantly by an increase in the number of CD8+CD28- T cells. To characterize further the subsets of CD8+ T cells, we have performed analyses of cell surface phenotype, T cell receptor Vbeta usage, and ability to survive in unstimulated cultures. CD8+CD28- T cells frequently expressed CD45RA. Nonetheless, coincident expression of CD95 (Fas) and high levels of integrins suggested that these cells were immunologically experienced. Contrary to what has been observed in CD8+CD28- T cells from uninfected individuals, a common hierarchy of Vbeta usage was found in CD8+CD28- T cells from HIV-1-infected individuals, which was adhered to by all the study participants, and which was shown to be similar to that observed within CD8+CD28+ T cells. Cells from the memory subsets of CD8+ T cells showed a high incidence of spontaneous death in unstimulated cultures, indicating that these cells have received signals for death by apoptosis in vivo. In contrast, most naive CD8+CD28+CD45RA+ cells survived. The CD8+CD28- memory subset is expanded in vivo despite evidence for coincident excessive cell death in vitro. Our results are consistent with the notion that frequent transitions occur from the memory CD8+CD28+CD45RA- T cell subset to the end-stage CD8+CD28- subset during HIV-1 infection."
16863,0.005,1.0000,"A randomized, open-label comparative study of entecavir versus adefovir therapy was performed in subjects with chronic hepatitis B who had hepatic decompensation (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score ≥7). Adult subjects were randomized and treated (n = 191) with entecavir 1.0 mg or adefovir 10 mg daily for up to 96 weeks from the date of last subject randomization. Subjects were positive or negative for hepatitis B e antigen and experienced or naive for treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean reduction in serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, as determined by polymerase chain reaction, at week 24, adjusted for baseline HBV DNA and lamivudine resistance status by linear regression analysis. Entecavir demonstrated superiority to adefovir for this endpoint (treatment difference 1.74 log(10) copies/mL [95% confidence interval -2.30, -1.18]; P < 0.0001). The entecavir group showed a greater change from baseline in HBV DNA at all time points through week 48 and a higher proportion of subjects who achieved HBV DNA < 300 copies/mL at weeks 24 (entecavir 49%; adefovir 16%; P < 0.0001) and 48 (entecavir 57%; adefovir 20%; P < 0.0001). Approximately two-thirds of subjects in both groups showed improvement/stabilization in Child-Turcotte-Pugh status. Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score change at week 48 was -2.6 for entecavir and -1.7 for adefovir. Adverse event rates were comparable between groups. Cumulative hepatocellular carcinoma rates were 12% for entecavir and 20% for adefovir. Cumulative death rates were 23% for entecavir and 33% for adefovir. Week 24 mortality rates were 12% for both groups. conclusion: Entecavir demonstrated superior virologic efficacy to adefovir in a population of patients with chronic hepatitis B who had hepatic decompensation. Biochemical and clinical benefits were also demonstrated. Entecavir was well tolerated, and early mortality rates were consistent with rates observed in similar populations treated with lamivudine."
9288,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the duodenal mucosa of HIV-infected patients during antiretroviral therapy. This was an observational study conducted on HIV-positive patients and a control group. Group 1 comprised 22 HIV-negative individuals while 38 HIV-positive individuals were classified according to the CDC 1993 classification into group 2 (A1 or A2) or group 3 (B2, A3, B3, C2, C3). All subjects were submitted to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal biopsies. Qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative histological analyses were performed. Results were considered significant when P < 0.05. A higher prevalence of inflammatory infiltrate and eosinophilia was observed in the HIV group, together with a reduction in mucosal CD4+ lymphocyte (L) counts [median (lower-upper quartiles), 12.82 (8.30-20.33), 6.36 (1.75-11.66) and 1.75 (0.87-3.14) in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively] which was not correlated with disease stage. The extent of CD4+L count reduction was similar in blood and duodenal mucosa. Normal CD8+L and CD45RO+L counts, and normal numbers of macrophages and antigen-presenting cells were also found in the HIV patients. The cytokine pattern did not differ among groups. Tissue HIV, assessed by p24 antigen, correlated with a higher CD45RO+L count (77.0 (61-79.8) and 43.6 (31.7-62.8) in p24+ and p24-, respectively, P = 0.003), and IL-4 positivity (100 and 48.2% in p24+ and p24-, respectively, P = 0.005). The duodenal mucosa of HIV+ patients showed a relatively preserved histological architecture. This finding may be characteristic of a population without opportunistic infections and treated with potent antiretroviral therapy, with a better preservation of the immune status."

Therefore, in these settings, timed unprotected intercourse without assurance of HIV viral suppression may pose unnecessary risks. TVI, a simple and affordable intervention, can be considered an adjunct method and option of safer conception for HIV prevention with treatment of the HIV-infected partner and/or pre-exposure prophylaxis. We conducted five mixed and single-sex focus group discussions comprised of 33 HIV-serodiscordant couples and health-care providers in the Nyanza region of Kenya to assess the acceptability and feasibility of TVI as a safer method of conception. The transcribed data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. We found that educating and counseling HIV-serodiscordant couples on TVI could make it an acceptable and feasible safer conception method when associated with frequent communication and home visits by health-care providers. The findings of this study indicate that implementation studies that integrate training and counseling of HIV-serodiscordant couples and health-care providers on TVI combined with consistent condom use are needed. Acknowledging and supporting the reproductive choice and needs of female positive, male negative HIV-serodiscordant couples who desire children should also include the use of assisted reproductive services at the same time as pharmaceutical options that prevent sexual HIV transmission."
15041,0.005,1.0000,"The factors contributing to unequal mortality rates following Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in different groups at risk are poorly understood. We therefore compared the first episodes of PCP without prophylaxis in human immunodeficiency virus infected (HIV) and otherwise immunosuppressed patients in this retrospective study. A total of 58 HIV-infected and 16 otherwise immunosuppressed patients were analysed. The comparison included epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological and microbiological data, as well as therapy and clinical course. A prognostic analysis was performed using a logistic regression model. The mortality was significantly different in the two groups (HIV group 17 versus non-HIV group 50%). Renal transplant patients had a higher survival rate as compared to malignancy or collagen vascular disease as underlying diseases at risk. Acute respiratory failure was more common in the non-HIV group. Variables found to be significantly associated with lethal outcome in univariate analysis were alveolar to arterial pressures difference for oxygen (P(A-a),O2), haemoglobin, platelet count, total protein, serum albumin, and gamma-globulins in the HIV-group, and serum albumin in the non-HIV group. In the multivariate analysis of the HIV group, platelet count and gamma-globulins remained independent prognostic factors. In conclusion, in the HIV-group, mortality is closely related to the severeness of PCP as well as to the severeness of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) disease. In the non-HIV group, malignancy and collagen vascular disease as underlying conditions at risk account for the high mortality rate. Its severeness was mainly reflected by serum albumin, which represented the only variable found to be significantly associated with death in both groups."
15766,0.005,1.0000,"Therapy with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), the backbone of triple combinations, is still widely used in early stages of HIV-1 disease. However, factors influencing virologic response need to be further analyzed, to test the hypothesis that the reduction of plasma RNA viremia with NRTI may be greater in patients with higher baseline viral load (BVL) and to analyze the predictive factors of viral load drop below detection (200 HIV RNA copies/ml of plasma). Selected for the study were 169 HIV-1-infected antiretroviral therapy-naive patients with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts ranging from 6 to 1040/microl coming from three randomized studies comparing the efficacy of monotherapy (zidovudine [ZDV], 250 mg every 12 hours; N=40) versus two-drug therapy consisting of ZDV (250 mg every 12 hours) with dideoxycytidine (ddC, 0.75 mg every 8 hours) or didanosine (ddI, 200 mg every 12 hours; N=129). Viral load was measured at 1, 3, and 6 months by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A linear regression model was used to analyze the relation between BVL and the peak reduction of plasma RNA viremia. The variables included in a logistic regression model to determine the likelihood of VLs dropping below detection levels were age, gender, risk group for HIV-1 infection, baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count, BVL, clinical status (AIDS versus non-AIDS), HIV-1 phenotype (syncytium-inducing [SI] versus non-syncytium-inducing [NSI]) and type of treatment (monotherapy versus double therapy). The peak reduction of VL was related to baseline level following a linear model in both monotherapy and double-therapy regimens. In the subgroup of patients treated with two NRTIs, the regression line that fitted best with the data was log10 (peak reduction)=1.8-0.36 log10 (BVL) (F=23.5; p < .0001). This indicates that for every increase of 1 log10 of BVL, the peak reduction would be of 0.64 log10 greater. Forty-nine (29%) of the 169 patients dropped to <200 copies/ml. The likelihood of dropping below detection level was significantly greater in those receiving double therapy versus monotherapy (odds ratio [OR]=16.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2-128), in those with baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count >350/microl (OR=2.28; 95% CI, 1.1-4.9) and in those with BVL <10,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml (OR= 2.25; 95% CI, 1.1-6.1). None of the 13 patients with an SI phenotype at baseline dropped below detection levels. The reduction of VL in response to two NRTIs was greater in those patients with a higher level of BVL. In conclusion, peak reduction below detection in response to NRTI can be predicted and is associated with double therapy, with a baseline CD4+ cell count >350/microl and with a BVL <10,000 RNA copies/ml."
1568,0.005,1.0000,"Antibodies to human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were evaluated among 1,171 persons with and without antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (anti-HIV-1). These included 97 blood donors, 577 persons given blood components or products, and 497 controls. A significantly higher proportion of anti-HIV-1 positive than -negative donors were anti-CMV-positive, a finding associated with homosexual contact among some of the former. Among subjects with treated clotting disorders, there was no difference in prevalence of anti-CMV or anti-EBV between anti-HIV-1-positive and -negative persons. The prevalence of antibodies to EBV early antigens showed no relationship to anti-HIV-1 status. Anti-CMV positivity in anti-HIV-1-negative donors was associated with an increase in mean CD8 counts and lower mean CD4/CD8 ratio. Anti-CMV and anti-EBV positivity in anti-HIV-1-positive subjects with treated clotting disorders was not associated with a lower CD4 or higher CD8 count than HIV-1 infection alone. Subjects who developed AIDS after enrollment had no significant difference in median time from entry to diagnosis when analyzed by serologic evidence of CMV and EBV antibody status at entry, and a few subjects had AIDS at entry without serologic evidence of prior CMV or EBV infection. The overall results are consistent with acquisition and progression of HIV-1 independently of coincident CMV or EBV infection."
2488,0.005,1.0000,"To determine whether human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with incipient tubular or glomerular defects, we determined the urinary excretion of four low molecular weight proteins (LMWP); beta2-microglobulin (U-beta2-m), cystatin C (U-cyst C), Clara cell protein (U-CC16), and retinol-binding protein (U-RBP), the markers of tubular dysfunction, the excretion of albumin (U-Alb), a marker of glomerular defect, and the excretion of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (U-NAG), a marker of structural damage of the proximal tubular epithelium. Their determinants have been assessed by stepwise regression analysis using as possible predictors age, sex, serum-beta2-m (S-beta2-m), CD4 lymphocyte count, or HIV infection stage and therapy. The study involved 76 HIV-infected patients without renal disease, 56 with S-beta2-m < 5 mg/L (Group B1), 20 with S-beta2-m > or = 5 mg/L (Group B2), and 30 HIV-negative controls. Fourteen patients (18.4%) had no abnormal urinary protein loss, and 62 (81.6%) had elevated urinary excretion of at least one protein (Alb, LMWP, or NAG). A single urinary protein was abnormal in 21 patients (U-beta2-m, n = 9; U-RBP, n = 2; U-CC16, n = 4; and U-Alb, n = 6). At least two LMWP were abnormal without increased U-Alb in 23 patients (12 with increased and 11 with normal U-NAG). Ten patients had an increased urinary excretion of at least one LMWP together with U-Alb (5 with increased and 5 with normal U-NAG). An increased urinary excretion of all proteins was observed in the last 8 patients. The average urinary excretion of all proteins (except cyst C) was significantly higher in HIV than in the control group. As expected, U-beta2-m and the prevalence of abnormal U-beta2-m values were higher in the B2 than in the B1 group (P = 0.0001), whereas the average urinary excretion and the prevalence of elevated values of Alb, LMWP (except beta2-m) or NAG were the same in both HIV groups. By stepwise regression analysis, age emerged as a significant determinant of urinary excretion of beta2-m and CC16, whereas male sex was associated with increased U-CC16. S-beta2-m, CD4-lymphocyte count, or HIV infection stage emerged as significant determinants only for U-beta2-m as a consequence of a close correlation between S-beta2-m and either HIV infection stage (r = -0.52, P = 0.0001), or CD4 count (r = -0.45, P = 0.0002). Over 80% of HIV-infected patients without overt renal disease have evidence of glomerular permeability defects or tubular dysfunction, whatever the stage of the disease. U-Alb, RBP, and CC16 appear as the most sensitive and reliable early markers of these abnormalities. Their cause and prognostic value remain to be determined."
18372,0.005,1.0000,"Although lifespan has dramatically improved in the human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+) population, HIV and its treatment continue to be a source of substantial morbidity in many organ systems, including the genitourinary tract. As the number of long-term survivors increases with advances in antiretroviral therapy, age-associated urologic symptoms are also becoming increasingly relevant considerations for people living with HIV. Primary care physicians have a major role to play in maintaining the genitourinary health of their HIV+ patients. This role is of great importance not just for the well-being of the individual patient but for the public health, as the genitourinary tract is a common vector for HIV transmission. In this article the authors review the management of the genitourinary system in patients with HIV infection. Particular consideration is given to urinary tract infections, lower urinary tract symptoms, renal insufficiency, sexual and fertility problems, and cancers of the genitourinary tract. Management algorithms are outlined and indications for referral to a urologist are emphasized."
5326,0.005,1.0000,"Women comprise one in five new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnoses in the United States. Trials and implementation projects demonstrate preexposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention is effective in women. Preexposure prophylaxis is a method of preventing HIV acquisition by having an HIV-negative individual take antiretroviral medication before exposure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate coformulated with emtricitabine as preexposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention in 2012. Preexposure prophylaxis is highly dependent on adherence for effectiveness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends offering preexposure prophylaxis to individuals at significant risk of infection and estimates 468,000 women in the United States are eligible for preexposure prophylaxis. Although variable individual and structural forces affect each woman's medication adherence, and therefore the effectiveness of preexposure prophylaxis, women's health care providers are uniquely positioned to screen, counsel about, and offer preexposure prophylaxis. Shared decision-making provides a framework for these clinical encounters, allowing patients and clinicians to make health care decisions together based on scientific evidence and patient experiences. By incorporating fertility desires and contraceptive needs, health care providers effectively integrate sexual and reproductive health care. Including preexposure prophylaxis in women's health services requires health care provider training and attention to lessons learned from family planning and HIV prevention. Nevertheless, obstetrician-gynecologists have an opportunity to play a critical role in reducing sexual transmission of HIV in the United States by integrating preexposure prophylaxis education and provision into their practices."
317,0.005,1.0000,"Natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in host defense against viral infections. However chronic HIV-1 infection is associated with an accumulation of dysfunctional NK cells, that poorly control viral replication. The underlying mechanisms for this NK cell mediated dysfunction are not understood. Certain tumors evade NK cell mediated detection by dampening NK cell activity through the downregulation of NKG2D, via the release of soluble NKG2D-ligands, resulting in a potent suppression of NK cell function. Here we show that chronic HIV-1 infection is associated with a specific defect in NKG2D-mediated NK cell activation, due to reduced expression and transcription of NKG2D. Reduced NKG2D expression was associated with elevated levels of the soluble form of the NKG2D-ligand, MICA, in patient sera, likely released by HIV+CD4+ T cells. Thus, like tumors, HIV-1 may indirectly suppress NK cell recognition of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells by enhancing NKG2D-ligand secretion into the serum resulting in a profound impairment of NK cell function."
16484,0.005,1.0000,"Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection control, and are regulated by a complex network of activating and inhibitory receptors. However, NK cell activity in HBV patients remains poorly understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the phenotypic and functional characteristics of circulating NK cells in patients during different chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection stages. We investigated NK cell phenotypes, receptor expression and function in 86 CHB patients and 20 healthy controls. NK cells were purified and NK cell subsets were characterized by flow cytometry. Cytotoxic activity (CD107a) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) secretion were examined, and Natural Killer p46 (NKP46) blockade and spontaneous NK cell cytolytic activity against K562, HepG2 and HepG2.215 cell lines was studied. Activating NKp46 receptor expression was higher in inactive HBsAg carriers when compared with other groups (p = 0.008). NKp46 expression negatively correlated with HBV DNA (R = -0.253, p = 0.049) and ALT (R = -0.256, p = 0.045) levels. CD107a was higher in immune-activated groups when compared with immune-tolerant groups (p = 0.039). CD107a expression was related to viral load (p = 0.02) and HBeAg status (p = 0.024). In vitro NKp46 blockade reduced NK cell cytolytic activity against HepG2 and HepG2.215 cell lines (p = 0.02; p = 0.039). Furthermore, NK cells from high viral load CHB patients displayed significantly lower specific cytolytic activity against anti-NKp46-loaded K562 targets (p = 0.0321). No significant differences were observed in IFN-γ secretion (p > 0.05). In conclusion, NKp46 expression regulates NK cell cytolytic function. NKp46 may moderate NK cell activity during HBV replication suppression and HBV-associated liver damage and may be critical for NK cell activity during CHB infection. "
15511,0.005,1.0000,"The African green monkey (AGM) model system for simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV(agm)) has been used to examine why prolonged infection with the relevant virus does not result in the development of immunodeficiency in its natural host. Blood lymphocyte subset values were determined in uninfected (n=88) and naturally SIV(agm)-infected AGMs (n=74). A number of blood cell subsets, such as CD8alpha(+)CD3(+)CD28(neg), CD8alpha(+)CD3(neg) and CD20(+) cells, were expanded significantly in clinically asymptomatic animals carrying a relatively high plasma load of viral RNA (10(4)-10(7) RNA copies/ml plasma). The expanded CD8alpha(+)CD3(+)CD28(neg) subpopulation (1094 +/- 986 cells/microl blood in infected animals versus 402 +/- 364 cells/microl blood, P=0.03) comprised cells that resembled terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cells (CD27(neg) and CD11a(+)). In SIV(agm)-infected animals, the expanded CD8alpha(+)CD3(neg) cell subset shared identity with the CD16(+) population (natural killer cells). These results demonstrate for the first time that apathogenic SIV(agm) infection causes significant changes in the immune system of its natural host. Although previous studies had indicated that noncytotoxic mechanisms might play an important role in the suppression of virus replication in the natural host of SIV(agm), this study sheds new light on the possible role of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, the innate immune system and double-positive T helper cells (CD4(+)CD8alpha(+)CD3(+)) in suppressing virus replication in this animal model of AIDS."
14583,0.005,1.0000,"To determine if suppression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication during antiretroviral therapy correlates with clinical outcome, serial quantitative serum cultures and HIV p24 antigen measurements were made in patients with advanced HIV disease treated with didanosine. Twenty-one (78%) of 27 had viremia detected, and in 14 (67%) viral titer decreased by fivefold or more. Compared with those with no decrease, patients who had a decrease in titer were more likely to achieve a > or = 5% increase in body weight (8/12 vs. 0/7, P = .013) and had a significantly greater mean increase in body weight during treatment months 1-5. Occurrence of new AIDS-defining illnesses and survival were not significantly different between groups. Changes in p24 antigenemia did not correlate with any parameter of clinical outcome examined. Changing serum HIV titer is a marker of the virologic effect of didanosine therapy that correlates with the early clinical benefit as reflected by weight gain. However, correlation of this marker with long-term clinical benefit is uncertain."
14348,0.005,1.0000,"CD56(pos) natural killer (NK)/natural T (NT) cells are important innate effectors providing the first line of defense against viral infection. Enhanced NK activity has been shown to protect from human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection. However, the role played by these innate effectors in protection against or development of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is unknown. We characterized CD56(pos) populations in 11 injection drug users (IDUs) who remained uninfected despite being repeatedly exposed to HCV. NK profiles in exposed but uninfected (EU) individuals were compared with preinfection samples (median 90 days prior to HCV seroconversion) collected from 14 IDUs who were exposed and subsequently became infected (EI) and unexposed normal control subjects (n = 8). Flow cytometric analysis of CD56(pos) populations demonstrated that EUs had a higher proportion of CD56(low) mature (P = 0.0011) NK cells compared with EI subjects. Bead-isolated NKs ( > 90% purity) from EUs had significantly higher interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced cytolytic activity against the NK-sensitive cell line K562 at an effector-to-target ratio of 10:1 (P < 0.0001). NKp30, a natural cytotoxicity receptor involved in NK activation, is highest on NK/NT cells in EUs relative to infected subjects. Using the JFH-1 infection system, we demonstrated that NKp30(high) cells in the absence of exogenous stimulation significantly reduce infection of hepatocytes."
13224,0.005,1.0000,"Lamivudine is a nuleoside analog with potent inhibitory effects on hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. Prolonged therapy is required for sustained suppression. However, HBV species with mutations in the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) locus of the HBV-RNA-dependent DNA polymerase confering resistance to lamivudine may emerge after 6-9 months therapy with an incidence of 38% and 67% after 2 and 4 years of lamivudine therapy, respectively. During continued lamivudine therapy, patients with YMDD mutant HBV usually show serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and HBV-DNA elevations at lower median levels than their baseline. Marked flare of serum ALT or acute exacerbation may occurred as the results of cytotoxic T lymphocyte mediated immune response directed against YMDD mutant. Although viral clearance with or without emergence of distinct lamivudine resistant mutants may occur after such exacerbations, 20% of the exacerbations are complicated with decompensation or even fatality. The exacerbations appear to be more severe than those occur during the natural course of wild type HBV chronic infection. The current practice of continuing lamivudine therapy, therefore, requires careful evaluation. Alternatives include interferon therapy but this seems ineffective. Adefovir dipivoxil and entecavir may effectively suppress the YMDD mutant but these treatments have not yet been available for use. Recent studies have shown no benefit to continuing lamivudine therapy in patients with YMDD mutantions. Before a rescue drug becomes available, the most cost-effective strategy is to select patients with stronger endogenous anti-HBV immunity to increase efficacy and to shorten the duration of lamivudine therapy to avoid the emergence of YMDD mutations."
12826,0.005,1.0000,"Recent studies demonstrate persistent elevation of interleukin-18 (IL-18) concentration in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients. Due to pleiotropic action of IL-18 on the immune system, dysregulation of its synthesis may lead to inappropriate immune activation. The aim of this study was to determine possible correlation between IL-18 levels and the natural stages of HIV-1 infection. IL-18 plasma concentrations were determined in 42 patients in different stages of an HIV-1 infection and in 15 healthy controls. HIV infection resulted in a more than fourfold increase of plasma IL-18 concentration compared to healthy individuals (865 +/- 87 vs. 206 +/- 32 pg/ml, P < 0.001). Moreover, a positive correlation between plasma IL-18 concentration and HIV viral load was found (r = 0.44, P < 0.01). Further analysis showed marked elevation of IL-18 levels in late-stage symptomatic patients. Plasma IL-18 concentrations in patients receiving high-activity antiretroviral treatment (HAART) were significantly lower than in those not undergoing antiretroviral treatment. Individuals who did not reach viral suppression showed higher IL-18 plasma concentration than the group with achieved viral suppression. Excessive production of IL-18 observed in our study may promote viral replication and disease progression in advanced, especially late-stage HIV-infected patients. Furthermore, reduction of IL-18 concentration can be an important step in HAART-related immune restoration."
8922,0.005,1.0000,"This study was undertaken to explain why chimpanzees infected with HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) or SIV(cpz) (simian immunodeficiency virus of chimpanzee) are relatively resistant to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). The numbers of beta-chemokine-positive cells were compared between uninfected and infected humans and chimpanzees using three-color cytofluorometry. In humans, the percentage of beta-chemokine-positive cells was significantly higher in CD8(+) T and natural killer (NK) cells than in CD4(+) T cells in both uninfected and HIV-1-infected individuals. In the presence of HIV-1 infection, however, both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell subsets contained significantly more beta-chemokine-positive cells than in the absence of infection. Interestingly, in chimpanzees two important differences were noted. First, their percentage of beta-chemokine-positive CD8(+) T and NK cells was significantly higher than in uninfected humans. Second, in contrast to humans, infection with either HIV-1 or with SIV(cpz) was not associated with increased numbers of beta-chemokine-positive cells. These results indicate that: constitutive high levels of intracellular beta-chemokines in chimpanzees' CD8 lymphocytes and NK cells do not necessarily correspond to lower levels of virus replication during the chronic phase of infection; and increased percentages of beta-chemokine-positive cells in HIV-infection are not a correlate of disease resistance. The data suggest that neither pre-nor post-exposure levels of intracellular beta-chemokines are correlated with the subsequent control of disease progression."
12752,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection is an increasing health problem in human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV(+) ) individuals. However, a considerable proportion of HIV(+) patients manage to overcome acute hepatitis C (AHC) spontaneously. In the present study, we analyzed the role of natural killer (NK) cells in modulating the course of AHC in HIV(+) patients. Twenty-seven HIV(+) patients with AHC (self-limited course: n = 10; chronic course: n = 17), 12 HIV(+) patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), 8 HIV monoinfected individuals, and 12 healthy controls were studied. NK cells were phenotypically analyzed by flow cytometry. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) secretion, degranulation (CD107a), and anti-HCV (= inhibition of HCV replication) activity of NK subpopulations were analyzed using the HuH7A2 HCVreplicon cell system. NK cell frequency did not differ significantly between HIV(+) patients with chronic and self-limited course of AHC. However, we found NK cells from patients with self-limiting infection to be significantly more effective in inhibiting HCV replication in vitro than NK cells from patients developing CHC. Of note, antiviral NK cell activity showed no significant correlation with NK cell degranulation, but was positively correlated with IFN-γ secretion, and blocking experiments confirmed an important role for IFN-γ in NK cell-mediated inhibition of HCV replication. Accordingly, NK cells from patients that spontaneously cleared the virus displayed a stronger IFN-γ secretion than those developing chronic infection. Finally, we observed high expression of NKG2D and NKp46, respectively, to be associated with self-limiting course of aHCV. Accordingly, we found that blocking of these NK cell receptors significantly impaired antiviral NK cell activity."

The impact of HIV/AIDS-specific pharmacy services on patient adherence and HIV viral suppression is currently not well described. This study aimed to compare the impact of differing levels of HIV-pharmacy care on adherence and time to HIV viral suppression among participants on HAART enrolled in a population-based HIV/AIDS drug treatment programme in British Columbia. We performed a retrospective observational study of 788 treatment-naïve patients who started HAART between August 1997 and July 2000 and were followed until 31 March 2002. The degree of outpatient pharmacy care was defined according to pharmacy dispensing site for the participants' first prescription of HAART: highest at the AIDS-tertiary care hospital outpatient pharmacies, intermediate at HIV/AIDS drug treatment programme funded off-site pharmacies and lowest at family physician's offices. Cox-proportional hazard models examined the independent effect of pharmacy dispensing site on time to two consecutive HIV viral suppressions controlling for other prognostic factors including physicians' experience, age, gender, injection drug use, use of therapy containing NNRTI versus PI, adherence >90%, AIDS diagnosis at baseline, baseline CD4 cell count and HIV viral load. The median time on antiretrovirals was 28 months (IQR=14-38). There were 489 (62.1%) participants who obtained their medications from the AIDS-tertiary care outpatient pharmacies; 98 (12.4%) from off-site pharmacies and 201 (25.5%) from their physicians' offices. The proportion of patients exhibiting >90% adherence to treatment was observed to be higher among patients receiving their HAART at the AIDS-tertiary care pharmacies compared to off-site pharmacies and to physicians' offices (70.4, 59.2 and 55.7%, respectively; p=0.0001). After adjusting for other prognostic factors, subjects who were first dispensed medications from the AIDS-tertiary care pharmacy were 1.42 times (CI: 1.10-1.84) more likely to achieve HIV viral suppression than those getting their medications from off-site pharmacies and physicians' offices. Providing regular outpatient pharmacy care is independently associated with improved HIV viral load response through enhanced adherence to HAART. Standardization of pharmacy practices for dispensing HAART may improve outcomes for patients who receive their HIV medications from other non-tertiary care pharmacy sites."

Due to the spread of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-infected patients now survive longer, and metastatic non-AIDS-defining carcinoma is increasing. A 49-year-old man with HIV infection undergoing treatment with HAART developed an intratumoral hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe. He was diagnosed as having lung adenocarcinoma and was found to have a brain metastasis with bleeding. After treatment for intratumoral bleeding, a contralateral frontal lobe hemorrhage occurred within a month. The patient underwent a second craniotomy and removal of hematoma, followed by whole-brain radiotherapy. He was then treated with four cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine combination chemotherapy while receiving HAART. A partial response was achieved, though he developed severe hematological toxicities for which the doses of chemotherapy needed to be decreased. However, as a result of treatment, his activities of daily life recovered gradually. This lung cancer patient had been alive for 17 months despite the coexistence of two disorders with a poor prognosis, HIV infection and bleeding brain metastases from lung cancer. This case revealed that physicians must include non-AIDS-defining cancer metastasis to the brain in the differential diagnosis of HIV-infected patients when they show stroke-like symptoms, and such patients may respond to treatment as well as non-HIV-infected patients with advanced lung cancer."

The primary outcome was the reduction of depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamliton rating scale for depression scale. The secondary outcome was adherence to HAART as measured by random telephone based pill counts. Outcome measures were collected by trained research assistants masked to treatment allocation. Analysis was based on intention-to-treat. Thirty-four participants met eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to receive T-CBT (n = 16) or f2f (n = 18). There was no statistically significant difference in depression treatment outcomes comparing f2f to T-CBT. Within group evaluation demonstrated that both the T-CBT and the f2f psychotherapy groups resulted in significant reductions in depressive symptoms. Those who received the T-CBT were significantly more likely to maintain their adherence to antiretroviral medication compared to the f2f treatment. None of the participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events. T-CBT can be delivered to low-income, urban dwelling HIV infected depressed individuals resulting in significant reductions in depression symptoms and improved adherence to antiretroviral medication."

An atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype has been described in HIV- infected patients with a predominance of small, low density lipoprotein (SLDL) particles with accompanying elevated triglycerides and reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol. This randomized controlled pilot study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Extended Release Niacin (ERN) in improving the lipid profile in HIV patients. A total of 17 HIV positive subjects on HAART therapy with High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL) levels below 40mg/dl and Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL) below 130mg/dl were enrolled. Nine were randomized to be treated with ERN titrated from a starting level of 500mg/night and titrated to a level of 1500mg/night. Eight patients were assigned to the control arm. No placebo was used. Lipoprotein profiles of the subjects were analyzed at baseline and at the end of 12 weeks using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. At the end of 12 weeks, NMR spectroscopic analysis revealed a significant increase in overall LDL size (1.2% in ERN treated subjects vs 2.0% decrease in control patients, P=.04) and a decrease in small LDL particle concentration (17.0% in ERN treated subjects vs 21.4% increase in control patients, P=.03) in subjects receiving ERN as compared to those in the control group. Only 1 subject receiving ERN developed serious flushing which was attributed to an accidental overdose of the drug. This pilot study demonstrates that ERN therapy in HIV-infected patients with low HDL is safe and effective in improving the lipoprotein profile in these patients. "
6543,0.005,1.0000,"The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and its co-administration with chemotherapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related lymphoma has lead to the exploration of potentially curative combination chemotherapy and myeloablative therapy followed by autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Applying the same principles used for patients with HIV-negative aggressive lymphoma, in 1998 we developed a program of high-dose therapy and ASCT at City of Hope for patients with HIV-related lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease. Our studies have primarily included patients with chemosensitive lymphoma in relapse or first remission with poor-risk features at diagnosis. Filgrastim (G-CSF)-primed peripheral blood stem cell mobilization and apheresis have been successful while patients were receiving HAART and chemotherapy. To date, ASCT has been performed in 19 patients with HIV-related lymphoid malignancies, representing the largest single-institution experience reported to date. Most patients received a chemotherapy-based conditioning regimen consisting of high-dose carmustine, etoposide and cyclophosphamide. Early infections, namely bacteremias and neutropenic fever were similar to those observed in the HIV-negative transplant setting. Opportunistic infections were rare and easily treatable. There were three early deaths, two from relapsed lymphoma and one from multi-organ failure in an older patient. The remaining 16 patients are alive and in remission. In summary, ASCT is well tolerated, can result in long-term remissions, and is potentially curative in selected HIV-related lymphoma patients with chemosensitive relapse and high-risk disease in first remission defined by the age-adjusted International Prognostic Index criteria (i.e., two or three of the following: elevated LDH, advanced stage, and poor performance status). Acquisition of resistance to HAART remains as a potential problem for HIV-positive patients who are cured of their lymphoma."
2643,0.005,1.0000,"The authors conducted a voluntary serosurvey and educational campaign among 3394 undergraduate students attending the University of Maryland at College Park to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Two students were seropositive (0.06%, 95% confidence interval 0-0.15%). Both were homosexual men with multiple sexual partners. Despite the low prevalence of infection, potential risk factors for transmission of HIV-1 were common, as assessed by a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. These included a previous sexually transmitted disease (12.6%), male homosexual intercourse (4.8% of men), heterosexual anal intercourse (25.3%), heterosexual intercourse with a person at risk (an HIV-1 infected person, a bisexual man, a parenteral drug user, a female prostitute, or a hemophiliac) (5.2%), multiple sexual partners (21% reported 10 or more lifetime partners), and intravenous drug use (1.3%). Assessment of the efficacy of our program by comparing responses on pre- and post-test questionnaires showed gains in knowledge about heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 and an increase in the reported frequency of condom use 1-2 months after participating in the survey. The authors conclude that HIV-1 infections are occurring among college students but in our study group remain confined to persons with known high-risk behavior; however, practices that may support transmission are common, and programs designed to diminish these behaviors among college students are needed."
14186,0.005,1.0000,"Available evidence suggests that young former Soviet Union immigrants in New York City have high rates of non-medical prescription opioid and heroin use, drug injection and injection-related risk behavior, making them vulnerable to hepatitis C virus (HCV)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, overdose and associated harms. This group has been the focus of little research, however. This paper presents quantitative and qualitative data from 80 former Soviet immigrants (ages 18-29) to characterize their opioid use trajectories, injection risk behavior, HCV/HIV testing histories and self-reported HCV/HIV serostatus, and provides clinically meaningful data to inform tailored education, prevention and harm reduction interventions.

6060,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C prevention counselling and education are intended to increase knowledge of disease, clarify perceptions about vulnerability to infection, and increase personal capacity for undertaking safer behaviours. This study examined the association of drug equipment sharing with psychosocial constructs of the AIDS Risk Reduction Model, specifically, knowledge and perceptions related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) among injection drug users (IDUs). Active IDUs were recruited between April 2004 and January 2005 from syringe exchange and methadone maintenance treatment programs in Montreal, Canada. A structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire elicited information on drug preparation and injection practices, self-reported hepatitis C testing and infection status, and AIDS Risk Reduction Model constructs. Separate logistic regression models were developed to examine variables in relation to: (1) the sharing of syringes, and (2) the sharing of drug preparation equipment (drug containers, filters, and water). Among the 321 participants, the mean age was 33 years, 70% were male, 80% were single, and 91% self-identified as Caucasian. In the multivariable analyses, psychosocial factors linked to syringe sharing were lower perceived benefits of safer injecting and greater difficulty to inject safely. As with syringe sharing, the sharing of drug preparation equipment was associated with lower perceived benefits of safer injecting but also with low self-efficacy to convince others to inject more safely. Interventions should aim to heighten awareness of the benefits of risk reduction and provide IDUs with the skills necessary to negotiate safer injecting with their peers."
4348,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion was studied in a group of 173 injection drug users in Bangkok, Thailand, who had been previously tested for HIV and were interviewed and retested in the fall of 1989. Ten percent of the group had seroconverted. Two factors protected against HIV seroconversion: having stopped sharing injection equipment in response to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and having a regular sexual partner. The association between self-reported deliberate risk reduction and reduced HIV seroconversion among persons continuing to inject illicit drugs indicates that injection drug users can change their behavior in response to AIDS and will accurately report on the behavior change, and that the changes can protect against HIV infection."
14572,0.005,1.0000,"Unsafe injection practices significantly increase the risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among injection drug users (IDUs). We examined individual and socio-environmental factors associated with unsafe injection practices in young adult IDUs in San Diego, California. Of 494 IDUs, 46.9 % reported receptive syringe sharing and 68.8 % sharing drug preparation paraphernalia in the last 3 months. Unsafe injection practices were associated with increased odds of having friends who injected drugs with used syringes, injecting with friends or sexual partners, and injecting heroin. Perceived high susceptibility to HIV and perceived barriers to obtaining sterile syringes were associated with increased odds of receptive syringe sharing, but not with sharing injection paraphernalia. Over half the IDUs reported unsafe injection practices. Our results suggest that personal relationships might influence IDUs' perceptions that dictate behavior. Integrated interventions addressing individual and socio-environmental factors are needed to promote safe injection practices in this population."
2930,0.005,1.0000,"Active injection drug use (IDU) is a behavior with the potential to offset healthcare engagement for those with HIV. At the Washington DC Veterans Affairs Medical Center, we identified 316 patients with a history of addiction during an 11-year period while actively engaged in routine visits to our HIV-primary care clinic. Among all IDU, active-abuse was determined in 141/316 (45 %). There were 120 clinically relevant blood stream infection (BSI) episodes. HIV/HCV co-infection (95 %) and use of antiretroviral therapy (76 %) were common at the time of BSI. The majority of BSIs occurred among those with active-IDU (72/120, 60 %). Active-IDU behavior was associated with more thrombotic disease (12 vs. 2 %, P = 0.001) and more frequent hospitalization (1.1/year ± 1.2 vs. 0.8/year ± 1.1, P = 0.03). When compared to drug-users with no active injection practices or those with remote IDU, active-IDU was associated with an increase in all-cause mortality (43 vs. 27 %, P = 0.003) and a decrease in age-adjusted survival (HR 1.7, CI 1.16-2.51, P = 0.007). Addressing addiction has the potential to impact avoidable medical complications and contribute to the continued, overall health of patients linked to HIV-care."
19456,0.005,1.0000,"Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) or body cavity-based lymphoma (BCBL) is a unique subgroup of B-cell lymphomas that exhibits exclusive or dominant involvement of serous body cavities without a detectable tumor mass. We present a case of a PEL/BCBL that exclusively involved the peritoneal cavity of a 58-year-old immunocompetent male with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver cirrhosis. The lymphoma cells were large, highly atypical and expressed CD19, CD20, CD22, CD10, HLA-DR, and CD45 with kappa light chain restriction. Unlike typical PEL/BCBL, human herpesvirus type 8/Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus (HHV-8/KSHV) genomic sequence was not present in the lymphoma cells and there was no serologic evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This is the fourth reported case of HHV-8 negative, HIV negative PEL/BCBL in a patient with associated HCV-related cirrhosis and review of these cases showed some consistent clinicopathological features, i.e. exclusive involvement of the peritoneal cavity and phenotypic expression of B-cell associated antigens in contrast to the generally null phenotype PEL/BCBL. The occurrence of these cases suggests that HCV may play an etiological role in a subcategory of PEL/BCBL not associated with HHV-8."
3272,0.005,1.0000,"We conducted an anonymous cross-sectional seroprevalence study of a population with a low frequency of injection drug use to determine whether persons with a history of cosmetic procedures, such as tattooing and body piercing, or intranasal drug use were at increased risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Students 18 years and older from eight college campuses in Houston, Texas, were invited to participate in the study. Of the 7,960 who completed a self-administered questionnaire and provided a blood sample, 5,282 U.S.- or Canadian-born participants were analyzed. Their median age was 21, 62% were female, 42% were white, 26% black, 22% Hispanic, and 10% Asian or other. Two percent reported injection drug use, 13.7% intranasal drug use, 21.2% body piercings, and 25.2% tattoos. The overall prevalence of HCV infection was 0.9% and of HBV infection was 5.2%. Higher HCV prevalence was independently associated with increasing age (odds ratio [OR] per year = 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08-1.14), history of injection drug use (OR = 18.24; 95% CI = 7.74-42.92), blood transfusion before 1991 (OR = 3.21; 95% CI = 1.02-10.12), and incarceration (OR = 3.48; 95% CI = 1.45-8.37). Among 5,066 students who denied injecting drugs, HCV prevalence was 0.8% in those who reported intranasal drug use and 0.6% each in those who reported tattoos and those who reported body piercing. Increased HBV prevalence was associated with high-risk sexual behaviors and black or Asian race. In conclusion, there was no increased risk for HCV or HBV infection in low-risk adults based solely on history of cosmetic procedures or snorting drugs. However, proper infection control practices for cosmetic procedures should be followed, illegal drug use discouraged, and hepatitis B vaccination provided to adolescents and sexually active adults."
2287,0.005,1.0000,"Drug injection and other practices affecting the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were studied among 154 heroin users and 45 methamphetamine users in San Antonio, Texas. Amphetamine users were younger, mostly white, and had less-severe drug dependence. Heroin users had significantly higher levels of needle risk, as indicated by frequency of injection, number of persons sharing equipment, and place of injection. Methamphetamine users tended to buy syringes in lots of 10 or more from pharmacies and to use a syringe less than 5 times before discarding it. Heroin users tended to buy 1 needle at a time from an illicit source and to use it more than 20 times. Of methamphetamine users, 71% had more than one sex partner, compared to 39% of heroin users. Partners of methamphetamine users were more likely to be drug injectors than were partners of heroin users. Fewer methamphetamine users reported a behavior change in response to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, and fewer had been contacted by AIDS Education/Outreach. We suggest that efforts to promote risk reduction among methamphetamine users be stepped up because this population has been underserved and because less-sweeping behavior changes are needed to reduce needle-related risks to acceptable levels."
7593,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) pol/RT mutations that confer clinical resistance to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) have not been detected to date. In vitro, the rtN236T adefovir dipivoxil (ADV)-associated resistance mutation confers low-level cross-resistance to tenofovir: 3- to 13-fold changes in EC(50) from wild type. This study evaluated the clinical response of rtN236T mutant viruses by comparing their early viral load decay kinetics to wild-type viruses in chronic HBV monoinfected patients harbouring rtN236T prior to initiating TDF or emtricitabine (FTC)/TDF therapy. Baseline samples (n = 105) from adefovir refractory patients were tested for the presence of rtN236T using a highly sensitive allele-specific PCR assay with an rtN236T detection cut-off of 0.5%. The rtN236T mutation was detected at baseline in 14.3% (14/98) of analysable patient samples (0.5-93.2%, rtN236T percentage range). The median change in total HBV DNA at week 24 was comparable for patients with rtN236T detected at baseline (-3.7 log(10) copies/mL, n = 14) as compared to patients with wild-type HBV (-3.2 log(10) copies/mL, n = 90). In patients with rtN236T, wild-type and rtN236T mutant virus showed similar rates of HBV DNA decline with no statistically significant difference observed at week 4. Moreover, the proportion of rtN236T remained unchanged in patients in either arm of the study during treatment. In conclusion, the rtN236T mutant virus showed similar HBV DNA decline kinetics to wild-type virus in adefovir refractory patients who switched to TDF or FTC/TDF. Despite low levels of cross-resistance in vitro, TDF similarly suppresses wild-type and rtN236T mutant viruses in vivo."
12587,0.005,1.0000,"The incidence of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is increasing among women of childbearing age. Women now account for 18% of the total number of cases of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), compared with 9% a decade ago. The medical care of pregnant HIV-infected women must take into account the high prevalence of substance abuse, preceded and often accompanied by significant levels of physical, emotional, and sexual trauma, and the concomitant stigmatization of these women in their families and communities. Pregnancy is often a time when women are motivated to make major positive behavioral and life-style changes. To do this, they need ongoing, multidisciplinary counseling and support, with recognition that progress may be intermittent and slow. The Special Prenatal Care Program at Bellevue Hospital is described to show the level of resource commitment that is needed as well as the nearly universal acceptance of voluntary HIV counseling and testing in these conditions. Trends in permanency planning for the children of HIV-infected women are described. Future research needs are outlined, including female-specific drug treatment and more effective contraceptive technology for both men and women."
6453,0.005,1.0000,"Opiate dependence among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients has been associated with negative clinical outcomes, yet few affected patients receive appropriate and coordinated treatment for both conditions. The introduction of buprenorphine maintenance therapy into HIV care settings provides an opportunity for providers to integrate treatment for opiate dependence into their practices. Buprenorphine maintenance therapy has been associated with reductions in opiate use, increased social stability, improved adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and lowered rates of injection drug use. We describe the following 4 models for the integration of buprenorphine maintenance therapy into HIV care: (1) a primary care model, in which the highly active antiretroviral therapy-administering clinician also prescribes buprenorphine; (2) a model that relies on an on-site specialist in addiction medicine or psychiatry to prescribe the buprenorphine; (3) a hybrid model, in which an on-site specialist provides the induction (with or without stabilization phases) and the HIV care provider provides the maintenance phase; and (4) a drug treatment model that provides buprenorphine maintenance therapy services with HIV services in the substance abuse clinic setting. The key barriers against effective integration of buprenorphine maintenance therapy and primary HIV services are discussed, and we suggest several mechanisms to overcome such obstacles."
18854,0.005,1.0000,"From 1995 to 2001, five rounds of sentinel surveillance were carried out for young women attending antenatal care clinics at four health centers in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, to monitor trends in the prevalence of HIV infection and syphilis. Serum samples were tested for antibodies to HIV (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting) and antibodies to Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum hemagglutination assay and rapid plasma reagin test). Prevalence ratios for an increase in one calendar year were estimated using log-binomial models. Between 1995 and 2001, the prevalence of HIV infection among young women (age range, 15-24 years) attending antenatal care clinics in inner city health centers declined from 24.2% to 15.1% (prevalence ratio for an increase in one calendar year, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-0.95). No change was observed for older age groups or in outer city health centers. The decline in the prevalence of active syphilis (T. pallidum hemagglutination assay and rapid plasma reagin testing positive for antibodies to T. pallidum) was more pronounced among and also restricted to the young age groups (age range, 15-24 years) in the inner city (from 7.6% in 1995 to 1.3% in 2001; prevalence ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.80). The declining trends in the prevalence of HIV infection and syphilis among young women attending antenatal care clinics in the inner city are encouraging, but these findings require confirmation in future years and for other population groups."
9594,0.005,1.0000,"Syphilis is a frequent coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Whereas systemic syphilis infection increases plasma HIV RNA levels (viral load; VL), effects of syphilis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VL are unknown. We hypothesized that intrathecal immune activation in neurosyphilis would selectively increase CSF VL in coinfected patients. In this study, HIV-infected research subjects (N = 225) were categorized into three groups based on serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR), microhemaglutination for Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP) MHA-TP, and CSF VDRL: 23 with neurosyphilis (NS+; reactive serum RPR and MHA-TP and positive CSF VDRL); 42 with systemic syphilis but not neurosyphilis (Syph+; reactive serum RPR and MHA-TP; negative CSF VDRL), and 160 without syphilis (Syph-; nonreactive serum RPR). Plasma and CSF HIV VL were quantified by reverse transcriptase-ploymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Amplicor, Roche) in log(10) copies/ml. To adjust for covariates previously shown to influence CSF HIV VL (i.e., plasma VL, CD4, pleocytosis, and highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]), multivariable linear regression was used. Lumbar punctures (LP) done for research purposes diagnosed 23 with neurosyphilis; most (83%) of these reported prior syphilis treatment. Among subjects with detectable plasma VL, CSF VL was highest in NS+, followed by Syph+ and Syph- (P =.006). This relationship was independent of the level of plasma VL or CSF pleocytosis. By contrast, among subjects with undetectable plasma HIV VL, CSF VLs were similar in the three syphilis subgroups (P = .50). Neurosyphilis may amplify intrathecal HIV replication, possibly through immune activation that persists even after syphilis treatment. Because elevated CSF VL is associated with subsequent neurocognitive decline, future studies should evaluate the impact of neurosyphilis on the course of central nervous system (CNS) HIV infection."
9814,0.005,1.0000,"Neurosyphilis (NS) is an important component of central nervous system diseases among HIV-infected patients. However, its characteristics are not very clear. A retrospective analysis of clinical and laboratory findings was performed in 92 NS patients with HIV infection from a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China. The patients had a median age of 38 years and a median CD4 count of 198 cells/μL. In all, 44.6% (41/92) were diagnosed as asymptomatic NS (ANS), 23.9% (22/92) as syphilitic meningitis, 17.4% (16/92) as cerebrovascular NS, and 14.1% (13/92) as parenchymal syphilis. A quarter of patients (23/92) complicated with ocular syphilis (OS), 60.9% (14/23) of which were ANS. The serum tolulized red unheated serum test (TRUST) titers were ≤1:8 in 15 patients (16.3%), 1:16-1:128 in 51 patients (55.4%), and ≥1:256 in 26 patients (28.3%). Sixty-nine patients (75.0%) had both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) TRUST and Treponema pallidum particle assay reactive. CSF pleocytosis and protein elevation were found in 58.7% and 53.3% of patients, respectively. Syphilitic meningitis was more likely to present with CSF pleocytosis than ANS (P = .001), cerebrovascular NS (P < .001), and parenchymal NS (P < .001). The proportion of patients with CSF elevated protein was lower in ANS group than that in syphilitic meningitis (P = .003), cerebrovascular NS (P = .001), and parenchymal NS groups (P = .025), and was higher in sero-TRUST titers ≤1:8 group than that in 1:16-1:128 (P = .01) and 1:256-1:1024 groups (P = .005).This study revealed that ANS was the most common clinical type of NS in HIV-infected patients, which should be considered in HIV and syphilis co-infection patients without neurologic symptoms, especially in those with OS. Different patterns of NS might have different CSF features which may also vary with sero-TRUST titers."

This was a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and identify its association with the clinical and metabolic parameters among 214 HIV-positive female patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Brazil. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (< 30 ng/ml) was 40.65% (87/214). Hypercholesterolemia, high LDL-c, duration of use of current antiretroviral regimen, hypertriglyceridemia, body mass index, age, hypertension, time with AIDS ≥ 10 years and hyperglycemia were selected for multivariate analysis (p < 0.20). After this analysis, hypercholesterolemia and use of current antiretroviral regimen ≥ 3 years remained independently associated with vitamin D deficiency. There was an inverse statistically significant correlation between total cholesterol and serum 25(OH)D levels. High prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was found among HIV-positive women on ART and was independently associated with its prolonged use and with hypercholesterolemia."
12174,0.005,1.0000,"In order to assess the frequency, risk factors, etiology, and clinical outcome of HIV-related sepsis and bacteremia, according to the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), all episodes occurred in patients hospitalized during years 1993-1995 (pre-HAART era), have been compared with those diagnosed after HAART introduction (years 1997-2000). On the whole, 498 patients suffered from sepsis/bacteremia in the two considered time periods, but the frequency of this complication proved significantly lower during the last 4 years, as opposed to the pre-HAART period (5.3 versus 18.2 episodes per patient-year: p<.0001). Among potential risk factors, during the last 4 years a significant rise of mean CD4+ lymphocyte count was observed (p<.0001), together with a reduced frequency of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000 cells/ L) (p<.02), and a less frequent association with an advanced HIV disease (stage C, CDC) (p<.03). Despite a remarkably reduced mean duration of admission, during the HAART era a significant increase of nosocomial- versus community-acquired infection occurred (p<.002), with a related greater frequency of gram-negative bacilli of environmental origin: Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas (Stenotrophomonas), Acinetonbacter spp., and non-fermenting bacilli (p<.05). No significant difference was noticed between the two considered periods, as to patients' age, gender, and type of exposure to HIV, use of central vascular lines, prior administration of steroids, antimicrobials, and cotrimoxazole, as well as disease outcome (including the frequency of related deaths). On the whole, the significant drop of frequency of HIV-associated sepsis/bacteremia occurred after the introduction of HAART (over 3.4-fold, compared with that observed prior to HAART use), proved associated with a reduced degree of immunodeficiency, and a less advanced underlying disease. The proportional increase of nosocomial infections and related pathogens did not match with the apparently significant reduction of mean admission time. A careful and continued monitoring of epidemiological, microbiological, clinical, and treatment features of disseminated bacterial disease looks mandatory even during the HAART era, in order to update therapeutic and prophylactic strategies of HIV disease management."
18632,0.005,1.0000,"The clinical immunology laboratory is often called on to assess risk in pediatric patients with clinical evidence of immunodeficiency and possible human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposure while antibody tests are being considered or are underway. Since non-HIV-related conditions including neoplasia, certain viruses, and primary immunodeficiency can potentially produce lymphocyte subset imbalance and functional impairment, there is need for a laboratory approach to differential analysis of pediatric immunodeficiency. In addition, laboratory methods may also influence the results obtained. In order to investigate these issues, we screened pediatric patients with and without HIV exposure. Altered lymphocyte subset expression and function were found among non-HIV-infected pediatric patients. The use of percentage and absolute lymphocyte numbers was found to affect the results obtained in a significant manner. Some patients who were chronic blood transfusion recipients were found to have blocking factors, presumably alloantibodies, in serum, which affected detection of lymphocyte surface antigens. In this population, age at seroconversion was a factor influencing subsequent levels of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Significant differences in CD4+ T lymphocyte percentages were also observed in children congenitally exposed to HIV compared with controls, even among those children with CD4/CD8 ratios greater than 1.0, who therefore had possibly escaped infection. Immune changes in children should be interpreted with caution."
2054,0.005,1.0000,"Bone disorders such as osteopenia and osteoporosis have been recently reported in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but their etiology remains still unknown. The prevalence estimates vary widely among the different studies and can be affected by concomitant factors such as the overlapping of other possible conditions inducing bone loss as lypodystrophy, advanced HIV-disease, advanced age, low body weight or concomitant use of other drugs. All the reports at the moment available in the literature showed a higher than expected prevalence of reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV-infected subjects both naïve and receiving potent antiretroviral therapy compared to healthy controls. This controversial can suggest a double role played by both antiretroviral drugs and HIV itself due to immune activation and/or cytokines disregulation. An improved understanding of the pathogenesis of bone disorders can result in better preventative and therapeutic measures. However, the clinical relevance and the risk of fractures remains undefined in HIV-population. The clinical management of osteopenia and osteoporosis in HIV-infected subjects is still being evaluated. Addressing potential underlying bone disease risk factors (e.g., smoking and alcohol intake, use of corticosteroids, advanced age, low body weight), evaluating calcium and vitamin D intake, and performing dual x-ray absorptiometry in HIV-infected individuals who have risk factors for bone disease can be important strategies to prevent osteopenia and osteoporosis in this population. The administration of bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate), with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, may be a reasonable and effective option to treat osteoporosis in these subjects."
16982,0.005,1.0000,"With widespread access to high-quality medical care as in Australia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is now considered a chronic, treatable condition, with a good life expectancy. The use of combined highly active antiretroviral therapy has enabled effective suppression of the virus, but has also been associated with increased cardiac morbidity and mortality. Over representation of traditional cardiac risk factors, such as hyperlipidaemia and diabetes, as well as an increased incidence of ischaemic and non-ischaemic heart disease is now considered a major concern of treatment with antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, a contemporary management strategy for patients with HIV must include active prevention and treatment of cardiovascular risk. This review will outline the complex interplay between HIV infection, antiretroviral drug regimens and accelerated cardiovascular disease, with a particular focus on screening, prevention and treatment options in a contemporary Australian HIV population.

17696,0.005,1.0000,"Two-thirds of the world's HIV-infected people live in sub-Saharan Africa, and more than 1.5 million of them die annually. As access to antiretroviral treatment has expanded within the region; early pessimism concerning the delivery of antiretroviral treatment using a large-scale public health approach has, at least in the short term, proved to be broadly unfounded. Immunological and virological responses to ART are similar to responses in patients treated in high-income countries. Despite this, however, early mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa are very high; between 8 and 26% of patients die in the first year of antiretroviral treatment, with most deaths occurring in the first few months. Patients typically access antiretroviral treatment with advanced symptomatic disease, and mortality is strongly associated with baseline CD4 cell count less than 50 cells/mul and WHO stage 4 disease (AIDS). Although data are limited, leading causes of death appear to be tuberculosis, acute sepsis, cryptococcal meningitis, malignancy and wasting syndrome. Mortality rates are likely to depend not only on the care delivered by antiretroviral treatment programmes, but more fundamentally on how advanced disease is at programme enrollment and the quality of preceding healthcare. In addition to improving delivery of antiretroviral treatment and providing it free of charge to the patient, strategies to reduce mortality must include earlier diagnosis of HIV infection, strengthening of longitudinal HIV care and timely initiation of antiretroviral treatment. Health systems delays in antiretroviral treatment initiation must be minimized, especially in patients who present with advanced immunodeficiency."

To detect genotypic drug resistance, we sequenced all 1- and 2-year specimens with detectable HIV RNA viral load. To assess factors associated with emerging drug resistance, we used log normal regression with interval censoring, including covariates in the model for self-reported drug adherence, CD4 cell count, and HIV viral load at therapy initiation, and observed changes in these measures, type of prescribed ART drugs, diagnoses of opportunistic illness, and demographic characteristics. An estimated 14.2% [95% confidence limits (CL) 11.7, 16.9] and 26.6% (95% CL 22.7, 30.8) of patients developed primary drug-resistant mutations within 1 year and 2 years after initiation of therapy, respectively. Factors associated with drug resistance included drug nonadherence, partial or lack of viral suppression, higher viral load or lower CD4 at initiation of therapy, and initiation of ART with what is now considered substandard dual combination therapy. Our results demonstrate the need to strengthen adherence and continuity in treatment programs in order to avoid interruption of ART drugs. Treatment programs should pay attention to indicators of emerging drug resistance: incomplete or lesser decreases in viral load or increases in CD4 cell counts following initiation of therapy, and the occurrence of AIDS opportunistic illnesses."
16145,0.005,1.0000,"Where active antiretroviral therapy (ART) is accessible, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a survivable illness and effective ART can reduce HIV transmission. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) has emerged as a threat to the survival of individuals harboring both HCV and HIV, due to high prevalence and aggressive disease course. The HCV/HIV coinfection epidemic has been driven by people who inject drugs (PWID), although incident HCV is rising among HIV-infected men who have sex with men in the absence of drug injection. Coinfected individuals warrant aggressive treatment of both viruses; although early ART initiation is recommended to reduce the rate of liver disease progression, the most effective way to decrease HCV-related morbidity and mortality in coinfection is to achieve HCV viral eradication. Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents will soon revolutionize HCV treatment. Clinical data are needed regarding the efficacy of DAAs in coinfected PWID. Drug-drug interaction studies between ART, DAAs, and opiate substitution therapy must be expedited. Coinfected PWID should have equitable and universal access to HIV/AIDS, HCV, and addiction prevention, care, and treatment. Essential basic steps include improving screening for both infections and engaging coinfected PWID in HIV and HCV care early after diagnoses. Developing strategies to expand access to HCV therapy for coinfected PWID is imperative to stem the HCV epidemic and limit the morbidity and mortality of those at greatest risk for HCV disease progression. The ultimate goal must be the elimination of HCV from all coinfected PWID. "

Low, detectable HIV RNA has been studied as a risk factor for adverse health outcomes, but its clinical impact on cancer risk remains unclear.

4737,0.005,1.0000,"The advent of combination antiretroviral drug regimens has transformed HIV infection from a fatal illness into a manageable chronic condition. All patients with HIV infection should be considered for antiretroviral therapy, regardless of CD4 count or HIV viral load, for individual benefit and to prevent HIV transmission. Antiretroviral drugs affect HIV in several ways: entry inhibitors block HIV entry into CD4 T cells; nucleotide and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors prevent reverse transcription from RNA to DNA via chain-terminating proteins; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors prevent reverse transcription through enzymatic inhibition; integrase strand transfer inhibitors block integration of viral DNA into cellular DNA; protease inhibitors block maturation and production of the virus. Current guidelines recommend six combination regimens for initial therapy. Five are based on tenofovir and emtricitabine; the other uses abacavir and lamivudine. Five include integrase strand transfer inhibitors. HIV specialists should assist with treating patients with complicated HIV infection, including patients with treatment-resistant HIV infection, coinfection with hepatitis B or C virus, pregnancy, childhood infections, severe opportunistic infections, complex drug interactions, significant drug toxicity, or comorbidities. Family physicians can treat most patients with HIV infection effectively by choosing appropriate treatment regimens, monitoring patients closely, and retaining patients in care. "
16820,0.005,1.0000,"Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, an acyclic nucleotide analog of adenosine monophosphate, is the most recent addition to the antiretroviral arsenal. After conversion to tenofovir by diester hydrolysis, subsequent phosphorylation by cellular enzymes to form the active tenofovir diphosphate is necessary for antiretroviral activity. Preliminary data suggest that tenofovir is as safe and efficacious as stavudine when given in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz for the treatment of antiretroviral-naïve patients. In antiretroviral-experienced patients, the addition of tenofovir to stable background antiretroviral therapy resulted in approximately a 0.6 log10 copies/ml reduction in viral load relative to placebo. Extended follow-up suggests that such virologic gains may be durable. In vitro, recombinant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) expressing the K65R mutation showed a 3-4-fold increase in the 50% inhibitory concentrations of tenofovir when compared with wild type. In vivo, this mutation thus far appears to occur infrequently and is associated with variable virologic responses. Response rates to tenofovir vary with the number and pattern of thymidine analog mutations present before starting treatment with this agent. Tenofovir appears to be a well-tolerated agent in patients who are heavily pretreated and who have advanced disease. The main adverse effects appear to be gastrointestinal in nature and include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In animals, osteomalacia and nephrotoxicity have occurred with tenofovir at exposures much higher than those observed in humans. Although no patient had to discontinue therapy as a result of elevated creatinine levels or hypophosphatemia through 58 weeks of treatment, the toxicities associated with long-term tenofovir therapy in humans are unknown. Concomitant administration of tenofovir and didanosine increases the area under the concentration-time curve of the latter by 44-60%; monitoring for signs and symptoms of didanosine toxicity is recommended. The approved dosage of tenofovir is 300 mg (one tablet) once/day with meals. Given the ease of administration and relative safety from the perspectives of adverse effects and drug interactions, tenofovir has the potential to assume a large role in the treatment of patients with HIV infection."
4649,0.005,1.0000,"The purine analogues tenofovir and abacavir are precursors of potential substrates for the enzyme Inosine 5'-triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (ITPase). Here, we investigated the association of ITPase activity and ITPA genotype with the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) during combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In 393 adult HIV-seropositive patients, AEs were defined as events that led to stop of cART regimen. ITPase activity ≥4 mmol IMP/mmol Hb/hour was considered as normal. ITPA genotype was determined by testing two ITPA polymorphisms: c.94C>A (p.Pro32Thr, rs1127354) and c.124+21A>C (rs7270101). Logistic regression analysis determined odds ratios for developing AEs. In tenofovir-containing regimens decreased ITPase activity was associated with less AEs (p = 0.01) and longer regimen duration (p = 0.001). In contrast, in abacavir-containing regimens decreased ITPase activity was associated with more AEs (crude p = 0.02) and increased switching of medication due to AEs (p = 0.03). ITPA genotype wt/wt was significantly associated with an increase in the occurrence of AEs in tenofovir-containing regimens. Decreased ITPase activity seems to be protective against occurrence of AEs in tenofovir-containing cART, while it is associated with an increase in AEs in abacavir-containing regimens."
15976,0.005,1.0000,"Mortality rates among HIV-1-infected patients attending a government hospital in northern Thailand were investigated to evaluate the effect of antiretroviral (ARV) drug therapy on mortality. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data and history of ARV drug therapy were collected from all HIV-1-infected adult patients who attended the Day Care Center clinic from October 2, 1995 through October 31, 1999. The survival status of patients until October 31, 1999 was ascertained from the hospital records, mailing letters, and death certificates at the Provincial Health Office. Of 1110 patients who attended the clinic, we had data on duration of follow-up for 1081 (97%) with a total of 1175 person-years of observation; 607 (54.7%) patients died. Clinical status, CD4 group, ARV drug group, and registered year were independently associated with death. The adjusted hazard ratio of monotherapy to no therapy was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.87; p = .001) and that of dual therapy was 0.43 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.62; p < .001). The mortality rate of patients attending a government hospital in northern Thailand is high. Suboptimum ARV drug regimens like dual therapy had a substantial survival benefit. Further cost reduction for multiple ARV drug regimens is impatiently awaited."
11654,0.005,1.0000,"One of the most recent phenomena related to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the emergence of a new vulnerable population: the elderly. One of the factors that account for this increase is the development of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), which has provided better quality of life and life expectancy for HIV-positive patients. However, ART is associated with adverse effects such as dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Due to the impact of ART on lipid and glucose metabolism, many studies were published involving HIV infection and cardiovascular disease, as well as their risk factors and the use of ART, but few of them reported on the cardiotoxicity of this therapy in the elderly. The objective of this study is to review the main metabolic changes caused by the use of antiretroviral therapy and its impact on an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in elderly people with HIV."
11460,0.005,1.0000,"Since 2001, cases of hepatitis C virus (HCV) sexual transmission have been reported in France, among HIV-positive gay men who do not inject drugs. An earlier study focused on the incidence of acute hepatitis C and risk factors associated with HCV transmission. The present study, based on in-depth interviews, aimed to highlight the biography, the sexual practices and the experiences of gay men infected with HCV. Beyond an apparent uniformity, the group of interviewees illustrates a variety of situations, life stories and health pathways, depending on their age. These well-adjusted gay men were used to engaging in unprotected sexual practices, but before their diagnosis they largely ignored HCV-transmission risk, which was associated in their mind with a pejorative drug addict image. Once diagnosed with acute hepatitis C, they experienced a critical and emotional period during which they were open to discuss their sexual practices and reconsider risk-reduction procedures, without being willing to give up on their satisfying sex life. Health educators should consider labelling hepatitis C as an STI in order to disrupt its negative image and to help HIV-positive gay man raise their awareness of HCV-transmission risks and implement better risk-reduction strategies."
12881,0.005,1.0000,"Alcohol use negatively affects adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), thus human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) care providers need accurate, efficient assessments of alcohol use. Using existing data from an efficacy trial of 2 cognitive-behavioral ART adherence interventions, the authors sought to determine if results on 2 common alcohol screening tests (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test--Consumption [AUDIT-C] and its binge-related question [AUDIT-3]) predict ART nonadherence. Twenty-seven percent of the sample (n = 308) were positive on the AUDIT-C and 34% were positive on the AUDIT-3. In multivariate analyses, AUDIT-C-positive status predicted ART nonadherence after controlling for race, age, conscientiousness, and self-efficacy (P = .036). Although AUDIT-3-positive status was associated with ART nonadherence in unadjusted analyses, this relationship was not maintained in the final multivariate model. The AUDIT-C shows potential as an indirect screening tool for both at-risk drinking and ART nonadherence, underscoring the relationship between alcohol and chronic disease management."
7257,0.005,1.0000,"We conducted a prospective cohort study to evaluate intimate partner violence (IPV) as a risk factor for detectable plasma viral load in HIV-positive female sex workers (FSWs) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Kenya. IPV in the past year was defined as ≥1 act of physical, sexual, or emotional violence by the index partner (i.e. boyfriend/husband). The primary outcome was detectable viral load (≥180 copies/ml). In-depth interviews and focus groups were included to contextualize results. Analyses included 195 women (570 visits). Unexpectedly, IPV was associated with significantly lower risk of detectable viral load (adjusted relative risk 0.21, 95 % CI 0.05-0.84, p-value = 0.02). Qualitative findings revealed that women valued emotional and financial support from index partners, despite IPV. IPV was not a major barrier to ART adherence. The observed association between IPV and lower risk of detectable viral load in FSWs may be due to unmeasured personal and relationship factors, warranting further research."
17885,0.005,1.0000,"Unsanitary blood/plasma collecting activities in central China during the 1990's caused a high prevalence of blood-borne HIV-1 infection. Although the genetic characterization of the proviral DNA of HIV-1 circulating in the infected former blood donors (FBDs) has been reported, there is little information about the biological characteristics of virus isolates in these FBDs. In this study, we have examined the biologic properties of HIV-1 isolates from AIDS patients and long-term non-progressors (LTNP) of FBDs. Our results indicate that the growth properties, co-receptor usage and syncitium inducing capabilities of the HIV-1 isolates are associated with the disease status of patients. The virus isolates from LTNPs replicated slower, used the CCR5 co-receptor and were of non-syncytium inducing phenotype. In contrast, HIV-1 isolates from AIDS patients showed high replication kinetics, used both CCR5 and CXCR4 co-receptors and induced syncytium formation. A higher level of cytopathicity was also detected in syncytium inducing virus compared to non-syncytium inducing isolates irrespective of patients' disease statuses. Although there was no significant differences in the binding and penetration of the target cells between the isolates from LTNPs and those from AIDS patients, viral DNA synthesis of viral isolates from LTNPs was much slower than the DNA synthesized by the isolates from AIDS patients, indicating a restriction at a post-entry step. Analysis of deduced amino acid sequences in C2-V5 regions of these isolates has provided a molecular basis for further identification of viral phenotypes of HIV-1 subtype B'. This study has provided valuable information on the biological properties of circulating HIV-1 strains among Chinese FBDs to better understand their viral characteristics and design more appropriate vaccine candidates for FBDs."
2700,0.005,1.0000,"The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to treat chronic illnesses, especially HIV, is becoming increasingly widespread. Given this popularity, it is critical to understand how HIV-positive individuals use CAM and, more specifically, whether CAM use impacts their adherence to prescribed antiretroviral regimens (HAART). The present study examined the relationship between CAM use and HAART adherence among HIV+ women. Data were analysed from 366 HIV-positive, mostly African-American women, aged 18-50 years in Alabama and Georgia who were enrolled in an intervention to reduce high-risk sexual behaviour. At enrollment data were collected describing use of CAM and HAART use. Women were classified as CAM users if they reported taking herbal/natural immunity boosters (Chinese herbs, mushrooms, garlic, ginseng or algae) or multivitamins, or reported using religious/psychic health or bodywork to treat HIV. Women were classified as non-adherent if they reported missing any doses of their HAART medication in the 30 days preceding baseline assessment. Logistic regressions models, adjusted for potential confounders, were used to investigate the relationship between CAM use and HAART adherence. Women using CAM (immunity boosters or vitamins), relative to non-CAM users, were 1.69 times more likely to report missing HAART doses in the last 30 days (CI: 1.02-2.80; P=.041) even after adjusting for age, education, race, religion and income. The findings provide preliminary evidence that patients using CAM may be doing so as an alternative to traditional medicine as opposed to complementing prescribed HARRT treatment regimens. The inconsistent use of HAART is problematic given its association with drug resistance. Therefore, health care providers and patients should have explicit dialogues about how to effectively integrate CAM practices into traditional treatment regimens so that the safety and health of HIV-positive patients is not compromised."
19700,0.005,1.0000,"Altered expression of drug transporters and metabolic enzymes is known to occur in infection-induced inflammation. We hypothesize that in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, further alteration could occur as a result of augmented inflammation. The HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) rat is used to simulate HIV pathologies associated with the presence of HIV viral proteins. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the effect of endotoxin administration on the gene expression of drug transporters in the liver of HIV-Tg rats. Male and female HIV-Tg and wild-type (WT) littermates were injected with 5 mg/kg endotoxin or saline (n= 7-9/group). Eighteen hours later, rats were euthanized and tissues were collected. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were used to measure hepatic gene and protein expression, respectively, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure serum cytokine levels. Although an augmented inflammatory response was seen in HIV-Tg rats, similar endotoxin- mediated downregulation of Abcb1a, Abcc2, Abcg2, Abcb11, Slco1a1, Slco1a2, Slco1b2, Slc10a1, Slc22a1, Cyp3a2, and Cyp3a9 gene expression was seen in the HIV-Tg and WT groups. A significantly greater endotoxin- mediated downregulation of Ent1/Slc29a1 was seen in female HIV-Tg rats. Basal expression of inflammatory mediators was not altered in the HIV-Tg rat; likewise, the basal expression of most transporters was not significantly different between HIV-Tg and WT rats. Our findings suggest that hepatobiliary clearances of endogenous and exogenous substrates are altered in the HIV-Tg rat after endotoxin exposure. This is of particular importance because HIV-infected individuals frequently present with bacterial or viral infections, which are a potential source for drug-disease interactions. "

4655,0.005,1.0000,"Gastrointestinal opportunistic infections, primarily oral and esophageal candidiasis, are common in persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality. Research early in the AIDS epidemic established a strong association between the presence of oral and esophageal candidiasis in patients complaining of odynophagia, demonstrated the diagnostic efficacy of a therapeutic trial with anti-fungal medicines, and defined the indications for endoscopy in HIV-infected persons with upper gastrointestinal complaints. Resulting diagnostic and treatment strategies with anti-fungal agents were very effective in preventing and treating mycotic infections of the gastrointestinal tract. Now, robust data from the United States and Europe indicate that recent advances in the development and use of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) are associated with a striking decline in the prevalence of oro-esophageal candidiasis in HIV-infected persons. In addition to developing more effective, safer antiviral agents, an HIV vaccine, and other novel approaches to combating this illness, a major challenge is to provide HAART to those without access to these life-saving drugs."
11723,0.005,1.0000,"Pain represents a significant source of morbidity, function loss, and decreased quality of life among people living with HIV. The present study examined the associations among pain, pain treatment, and ARV adherence among indigent, HIV-positive substance abusers. Participants were recruited via targeted sampling strategies, and completed a one-time computer-assisted personal interview. ANOVA and chi-square tests were used to analyze differences in demographics, health and psychological status, health behaviors, by pain and pain treatment status; a multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to examine the contribution of pain/treatment status to recent ARV adherence. Results indicated that those with untreated pain had lower odds of achieving gold-standard 95% ARV adherence as compared to the pain-free and treated pain groups; higher substance dependence symptoms were also associated with significantly lower odds of 95% ARV adherence. Findings suggest that pain management is critical to the health of people living with HIV, specifically those with high levels of co-morbid health and psychological problems. The prevalence of untreated pain was elevated among this group, and contributed to reduced ARV adherence. Providers of clinical care to disadvantaged HIV-positive patients should emphasize routine assessment and appropriate treatment of pain in order to provide comprehensive HIV care."
16077,0.005,1.0000,"Low response rates and concerns about safety have limited the implementation of treatment for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in patients with HIV infection. The efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) plus ribavirin in HIV-infected patients with CHC were evaluated in a prospective, open-label, multicenter study. Sixty patients with persistently high transaminases, positive HCV-RNA, CD4 count > or = 300 cells/microl, and HIVRNA <10,000 copies/ml were included. Patients were given peg-IFN 80-150 microg/week plus ribavirin 800-1200 mg/day. Treatment was scheduled for 24 weeks for genotypes 2/3 and 48 weeks for genotypes 1/4. In an intent- to-treat analysis, 16 (26.7%) patients achieved a sustained virological response (SVR). Twenty patients (33.3%) discontinued treatment prematurely, but only in 10 (16.6%) was discontinuation due to adverse events. Negative predictive values for SVR on the basis of HCV-RNA decline between baseline and week 4 were 100% for 1- and 2-log10 fall, and positive predictive values were 40% and 58.3% for 1- and 2-log10 fall, respectively. CD4 fell by a median of 216 cells during treatment, but no HIV-associated complications occurred. In conclusion, treatment with peg-IFN alpha-2b plus ribavirin is safe and clears RNA-HCV in about one-quarter of HIV-infected patients with CHC. Efforts should be focused on optimizing management of side effects and counseling to improve adherence and to keep patients on treatment. Assessment of HCV-RNA at week 4 may help guide early therapeutic decision making."
14107,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of the study was to evaluate the role of rapid virological response (RVR) in predicting sustained virological response (SVR) rates to hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy. 65 HIV / HCV co-infected patients commenced HCV treatment per protocol. HIV / HCV patients with a mean CD4 count of 502 were treated for 24-48 weeks depending on genotype. Virological response was assessed at weeks 4 (RVR), 12 [early virological response (EVR)], 24, at end of treatment (EOTR) and 24 weeks post-completion of treatment (SVR). Primary end-point was defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment completion. Fifty-five per cent of co-infected patients were on highly active anti-retroviral therapy. A majority of patient group were male. 60% of HIV / HCV patients achieved SVR (35% genotype 1 / 4; 77% genotype 2 / 3). 24 HIV / HCV patients achieved undetectable HCV levels compared with baseline by week 4. The positive predictive value (PPV) of RVR at week 4 for subsequent SVR in HIV-HCV co-infected patients was 100%; the negative predictive value (NPV) was 57%. Significant variables associated with SVR were: (i) lower median pre-treatment HCV viral load, (ii) genotype 2 / 3 disease and (iii) achievement of RVR. Independent variables associated with RVR were low pre-treatment HCV viral load and genotype 2 / 3 disease. Achievement of RVR, a negative HCV-PCR, at week 4 of treatment is predictive of SVR in this cohort of patients. This may be used to guide optimal treatment duration in patient groups. More significantly, the data serve to highlight the subgroup of patients who, on achieving RVR, should be actively supported to complete HCV treatment with full dose therapy, especially patients co-infected with G2 / 3 disease for whom 6 months' full dose therapy may be sufficient to obtain a SVR."
18757,0.005,1.0000,"The monocytic THP-1 cell line has been used to study HIV-monocyte/macrophage interactions and the relationship between differentiation, virus production, and virus latency. Undifferentiated THP-1 cells are susceptible to infection by T-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates that use the coreceptor CXCR4 (X4 strains). Treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induces differentiation of THP-1 cells into adherent macrophage-like cells, which are susceptible to M-tropic, CCR5-dependent isolates (R5 strains). The aim of this study was to determine whether variabilities observed in the susceptibility of THP-1 cells to HIV-1 infection may be related to the differential expression of CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4. Both propagation and PMA treatment of THP-1 cells resulted in a marked decrease in CD4-positive cells, whereas the expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 was not reduced during propagation. Both coreceptors were also relatively ""resistant"" to PMA-induced downregulation when compared with the low percentage of CD4-positive cells in differentiated cultures. In undifferentiated THP-1 cells, low CD4 expression significantly reduced the susceptibility of the cells to infection with the R5 HIV-1(BaL) isolate, whereas a PMA-induced decrease in CD4 expression reduced permissiveness of the cells to the X4 HIV-1(IIIB) isolate. Thus, cell surface CD4 plays a primary role in determining how efficiently THP-1 cells can be infected with the X4 and the R5 isolates."

A sample of 851 out-of-treatment IDUs was recruited in Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, between 2003 and 2005. Participants were tested for HIV and HCV antibodies. Demographic, drug use, and injection practice data were collected via interviews. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analysis. Participants had a mean age of 40 years and 74% are male, 63% are African American, 29% are non-Hispanic white, and 8% are of other race/ethnicity. Overall, 42% of participants had ever used an HDSS and 12% had shared one. HIV prevalence was 5% among IDUs who had never used an HDSS compared with 16% among IDUs who had shared one. The HIV model used a propensity score approach to adjust for differences between IDUs who had used an HDSS and those who had never used one. The HCV models included all potential confounders as covariates. A history of sharing HDSSs was associated with prevalent HIV (odds ratio=2.50; 95% confidence interval=1.01, 6.15). Use and sharing of HDSSs were also associated with increased odds of HCV infection. Prospective studies are needed to determine if sharing HDSSs is associated with increased HIV and HCV incidence among IDUs."
2588,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and identify the risk factors of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among healthy Egyptian children. A representative random sample of 500 children, age between 6 and 15 years, was selected from 10 schools in Alexandria, Egypt. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic data and potential risk factors, while blood samples were collected and analyzed for antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV). Positive sera were further confirmed by HCV-RNA. HCV seroprevalence of 5.8% was found, with HCV viraemia in 75% of the studied children. The prevalence of anti-HCV increased with age from 0% in children aged 6-7 years to 16% in those of 15 years old. It was also shown that history of previous blood transfusion (odds ratio[OR] = 34.8, 95% CI=4.39-272.95), intravenous injections (OR=4.68, 1.89-11.59), surgical intervention (OR=5.64, 2.55-12.52), dental treatment (OR = 6.81, 2.64-17.39), injection (OR=2.29, 1.08-4.89) and circumcision for boys by informal health care providers (OR=2.6, 1.0-6.73), age above 10 years (OR=6.83, 2.44-19.07), very low socioeconomic class (OR=5.92, 1.3-25.2) and rural area residence (OR=2.49,1.61-5.29) are the most significant risk factors for HCV infection. Adjusting for all other risk factors by multivariate logistic regression analysis, it has been shown that blood transfusion, surgical procedures, dental treatment, and age above 10 years are still significant risk factors associated with anti-HCV (P<0.05). The current study reveals the extremely high HCV seroprevalence among Egyptian children. This mandates immediate preventive strategies to limit further HCV spread."

We enrolled 200 pairs of sex- and age-matched patients with HCC and unrelated healthy controls. TNF-alpha polymorphisms were detected with polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) were detected. We used a structured questionnaire to obtain information about substance use habits.Multivariate analysis indicated that TNF308.2 allele (odds ratio [OR], 3.23; p = 0.011), habitual betel quid chewing (OR, 3.70; p = 0.011), HBsAg (OR, 23.62; p = 0.0001), and anti-HCV (OR, 38.73; p = 0.0001) were independent risk factors for HCC. Having at least 2 substance use habits was associated with risk for HCC. The more substance use habits, the higher the OR for HCC (p(for trend) = 0.0001). There were additive interactions among TNF308.2 allele, substance use habits, and chronic HBV/HCV infection. Multivariate analysis indicated that TNF308.2 allele (p = 0.001), cigarette smoking (p = 0.0001), and alcohol drinking (p = 0.0001) were independent risk factors for habitual betel quid chewing. Moreover, patients harboring the TNF308.2 allele and/or those with habits of substance use had low serum albumin concentration and platelet count (each p = 0.0001). In conclusion, there are independent and additive interactive effects among the TNF308.2 allele, substance use habits, and chronic HBV/HCV infection on the risk for HCC. Substance use habits or carrying the TNF308.2 allele correlates with disease severity and hepatic fibrosis, which may contribute to higher risks for HCC."

Fasting serum insulin and glucose measurements from 448 HIV-infected and 306 uninfected men enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study were collected at semiannual visits from 2003 to 2013 and used to compute the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR). Coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was performed at the end of the study period to characterize coronary pathology. Associations between HOMA-IR (categorized into tertiles and assessed near the time of the CTA and over the 10-year study period) and the prevalence of coronary plaque or stenosis ≥50% were assessed with multivariate logistic regression. HOMA-IR was higher in HIV-infected men than HIV-uninfected men when measured near the time of CTA (3.2 vs 2.7, p = 0.002) and when averaged over the study period (3.4 vs 3.0, p <0.001). The prevalence of coronary stenosis ≥50% was similar between both groups (17% vs 15%, p = 0.41). Both measurements of HOMA-IR were associated with greater odds of coronary stenosis ≥50% in models comparing men with values in the highest versus the lowest tertiles, although the effect of mean HOMA-IR was stronger than the single measurement of HOMA-IR before CTA (odds ratio 2.46, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.11, vs odds ratio 1.43, 1.20 to 1.70). This effect was not significantly modified by HIV serostatus. In conclusion, IR over nearly a decade was greater in HIV-infected men than HIV-uninfected men, and in both groups, was associated with significant coronary artery stenosis. "
11844,0.005,1.0000,"There are little data on antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among patients in Eastern Europe, despite the high incidence of HIV infection and the growing number of HIV-infected individuals who are being prescribed ART. The aim of this study was to measure rates of adherence to ART and factors associated with nonadherence among patients receiving care at an outpatient HIV clinic in Estonia. The study was based on cross-sectional data from a convenience sample of 144 patients receiving outpatient HIV care. Data were obtained via interviewer-administered surveys and data abstraction from clinical records. Adherence was measured from a 3-day patient self-report. Among 144 participants (mean age 33.8 years), two-thirds (63%) had been infected with HIV through intravenous drug use. Most (74%) were co-infected with hepatitis C (HCV). Perfect adherence over the last 3 days was commonly reported (88% [95% CI 81-92%]) with nonperfect adherence associated with greater concerns about the potential adverse consequences of taking ART (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.8, 95% CI 1.2-34.0) and average (versus good/very good) self-reported health status (AOR 4.7, 95% CI 1.2-31.4). Self-reported ART adherence in this sample of Estonian HIV-positive patients in clinical care was similar to rates observed in Western Europe and other developed countries. Results suggest that adherence education and support may be most helpful if they specifically target the development of positive beliefs, reduction of negative expectancies towards ART."
8041,0.005,1.0000,"Historically, the leading cause of death among persons with haemophilia and other congenital coagulation disorders was uncontrolled bleeding. Mortality was associated with severe deficiency of coagulation factors VIII or IX and especially with high-titre antifactor neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors). The catastrophic contamination of plasma donor pools with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) resulted in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome replacing haemorrhage as the leading cause of death among persons with haemophilia. Rather little has been written, however, about mortality among those not infected with HIV. The objective of this study was to identify conditions associated with all-cause mortality among HIV-uninfected patients who were followed for a mean of 8.8 years in the Multicentre Hemophilia Cohort Study. Among the 364 children (mean age 8 years), there were four deaths; two related to cancer, one to trauma, and the fourth to haemorrhage, end-stage liver disease and sepsis. Among the 387 HIV-uninfected adults (mean age 35 years) there were 29 deaths, with haemorrhage the leading cause of death, followed by hepatic, stroke and cancer deaths. Prognostic factors for all-cause mortality among the adults included haemophilia Type A with neutralizing antibodies [age-adjusted relative rate (RR) 3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-6.9] and serologic evidence of both hepatitis B and C virus (RR 4.1, 95% CI 0.97-17.6). Although hepatitis C viral load was slightly lower in patients with hepatitis B virus surface antigenaemia, it was unrelated to vital status. We conclude that causes of death and prognostic factors for current HIV-uninfected haemophilia patients are similar to those noted before the HIV epidemic. Better understanding, prevention and control of neutralizing antibodies and hepatitis infections may substantially improve longevity for people with haemophilia."
9072,0.005,1.0000,"Cytopenia is a common complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and can affect different hematopoietic lineages, including erythropoiesis, lymphopoiesis, thrombopoiesis, and granulopoiesis. Stem cell factor (SCF), a cytokine expressed by bone marrow stromal cells, is a multipotential growth factor acting on early progenitor cells of most hematopoietic lineages. Therefore, we investigated the serum SCF levels in 74 HIV-infected persons without active secondary infection at different stages of HIV infection [Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stages A through C]. Circulating SCF levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and were found to be significantly elevated in CDC stage A as compared with normal controls (7.18 +/- 1.94 ng/mL v 3.95 +/- 0.91 ng/mL, P = .04). However, in CDC groups B and C, SCF levels were lower than in CDC group A (3.29 +/- 0.75, P = .162, and 1.95 +/- 0.39, P = .005, respectively). Serum levels greater than 1.8 ng/mL were associated with a longer survival (P = .0037) in 74 HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-seropositive patients monitored for up to 114 weeks, suggesting that this cytokine may be directly associated with the disease course. A Cox proportional hazards model showed SCF to be an independent prognostic factor for survival (risk ratio for death, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.95; P = .019). Serum SCF levels decreased on follow up in 24 of 38 patients or remained below 0.4 ng/mL in 10 of 38 patients from whom a second blood sample was collected after a mean interval of 44 weeks. To determine potential regulatory factors of SCF expression by stromal cells, we exposed cultured fibroblasts to various cytokines. Only interleukin-4 (IL-4) upregulated SCF mRNA. As IL-4 is modulated during early HIV disease, it may be a key regulator of SCF secretion. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of SCF action and regulation in patients with HIV infection."
11422,0.005,1.0000,"Oropharyngeal candidiasis, typically caused by Candida albicans, is the most common oral disease associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), a 12-kDa antiprotease, suppresses the growth of C. albicans in vitro. To determine whether the mucosal protein plays a role in protecting oral tissues against fungal infection, we conducted a cross-sectional study investigating the oral and systemic health and salivary SLPI levels in 91 dentate HIV-1-infected adults receiving medical care in the southeastern United States. Participants with a self-reported history of clinical oropharyngeal candidiasis during the previous 2 years constituted the test group (n = 52), while the comparison group (n = 39) had no oropharyngeal candidiasis during that period. Data collected from medical records, oral examination, and SLPI enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantitation of whole saliva were analyzed by t test, analysis of variance, linear regression, and unconditional logistic regression. The test group had a significantly higher mean salivary SLPI level than the comparison group (1.9 microg/ml versus 1.1 microg/ml, P < 0.05). Linear regression modeling identified CD4 cell count and history of oropharyngeal candidiasis as key predictors of salivary SLPI and revealed a significant interaction (P < 0.05) between immunosuppression (CD4 cell count below 200 cells/ microl) and positive history of oropharyngeal candidiasis in predicting salivary SLPI level. By logistic regression modeling, a salivary SLPI level exceeding 2.1 microg/ml, low CD4 count, antiretroviral monotherapy, and smoking were key predictors of oropharyngeal candidiasis. These data support a key role for SLPI in the oral mucosal defense against C. albicans. The antimicrobial mucosal protein may serve as an indicator of previous oropharyngeal candidiasis infection among immunosuppressed persons."
19264,0.005,1.0000,"The study assessed rates and predictor variables of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among drug users receiving pharmacological treatment for opiates addiction. There was a large cohort study in 16 public centres for drug users in north-eastern Italy, with data collected by standardized face-to-face interviews between February 2001 and August 2001. Of 1095 participants, 74.2% were HCV seropositive. Anti-HCV status was independently associated with duration of drug use of over 10 years, injecting as a route of drug administration, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity. Further statistical analysis was conducted by dividing the subjects on the basis of the duration of heroin use: more or <10 years. In the multivariate analyses, route of drug administration and HBV status were associated with HCV seropositivity among both groups. Less education was associated with HCV among the shorter term drug users. HIV status and having a sexual partner with a history of drug use were associated with HCV seropositivity among the longer term drug users. Half of the short-term heroin users were still HCV seronegative when starting treatment, suggesting opportunities for reducing new HCV infections. Remarkable was the relationship between vaccination for hepatitis B and HCV serostatus. Being HBV seropositive was strongly associated with being HCV seropositive. But heroin users who had been vaccinated for HBV were not significantly more likely to be HCV seropositive than heroin users who were HBV seronegative. HBV vaccination does not provide biological protection against HCV; however, vaccinating heroin users against HBV may help to create a stronger pro-health attitude among heroin users, leading to a reduction in HCV risk behaviour."
13121,0.005,1.0000,"As per guidelines and recommendations, screening for renal diseases should be performed at the time of diagnosis of human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) infection; however, this remains largely unimplemented in many settings across Sub-Saharan Africa. We evaluated the renal function, urinalysis abnormalities and their correlates in HIV-infected individuals who were naïve to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This was a cross-sectional study of 2 months' duration involving 104 HIV-infected outpatients naive to HAART (71 women, 68%) attending the HIV clinic of the Yaoundé General Hospital in Cameroon. Renal and urinalysis parameters were measured and the Student t-test and Fischer exact test were used to compare the groups of participants. The mean age and CD4 count were, respectively, 35 ± 10.7 years and 305 ± 202/mL. Fifty-six (54%) patients presented with stages 3 and 4 of HIV infection. Forty-three (41%) patients had urinalysis abnormalities, including proteinuria (36%), leukocyturia (13%) and hematuria (12%). Proteinuria was associated with increased age, advanced stage of HIV infection, decreased CD4 count, hematuria and renal failure (P <0.04). Hematuria and leukocyturia were associated with decreased CD4 count and advanced stage of HIV infection, respectively (P = 0.04). The mean estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate was 100.2 ± 32.7 mL/min; three (3%) patients had renal failure (eGFR <60 mL/min) and 45 (43%) patients had reduced kidney function 60 ≤eGFR ≤90 mL/min. There was a high prevalence of decreased kidney function and proteinuria among Cameroonian HIV-infected patients naïve to HAART. Indicators of the severity of HIV infection, including advanced stage and low CD4 count, were associated with urinalysis abnormalities."
3955,0.005,1.0000,"The majority of HIV-infected people in sub-Saharan Africa are women, many of reproductive age. Cameroon is severely hit by the AIDS epidemic and has developed a large national program for improving access to antiretroviral treatment (ART). The reproductive intentions of women living with HIV/AIDS (WLHA) who obtain access to ART in this country remain poorly documented. Our study aimed at exploring factors associated with the desire to have a child among 1433 ART-treated fertile WLHA aged <50. Analyses were based on data collected during the national cross-sectional survey EVAL (ANRS 12-116), which was conducted between September 2006 and March 2007 in 27 HIV care centers in Cameroon. Logistic regression was used to explore factors associated with women's desire to have a child, defined as reporting the wish to have a/another child. A total of 791 women (55%) reported the desire to have a child. After adjusting for age, matrimonial status, number of biological children, and sexual activity, the main factors independently associated with this desire in a multivariate analysis were having a good physical health-related quality of life (1.02 [1.01-1.03] for a one-point increment on the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey scale) and a CD4 count at ART initiation <200 cells/mm(3) (1.7 [1.2-2.4]). As a conclusion, the desire to have a child is frequent among ART-treated WLHA in Cameroon. HIV care and family planning programs should be integrated more thoroughly in order to support WLHA's reproductive choices."
11013,0.005,1.0000,"Illicit drug users are commonly infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We evaluated the prevalence, incidence, and risk behaviors associated with HCV infection in 1,859 drug users in northern Thailand. The HCV prevalence was 27.3%: 86.0% among drug injectors (IDUs) and 5.3% among those who did not inject. Sexual behavior was not significantly associated with HCV among IDUs or drug users who used but didn't inject illicit drugs; only injection behaviors were independently associated with HCV in multivariate analysis. Among men, a history and increasing frequency of injecting drugs, older age, and a history of incarceration were associated with HCV infection. Among 514 opiate users who were HCV and HIV seronegative at baseline, 41 incident HCV infections and 6 HIV infections occurred on follow-up; the HCV incidence was 5.43/100 person-years; it was 44.3/100 person-years in IDUs and 1.9/100 person-years in non-injectors. HCV and HIV among drug users in Thailand are common and primarily associated with injection behavior."
10653,0.005,1.0000,"Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP) is the most frequent neurological complication among HIV patients, and its risk increases with use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We aimed to assess the prevalence of DSP and the factors associated with it among HIV-infected outpatients treated at Parakou University Hospital. This cross-sectional study took place from April 15 to July 15, 2011, and included 262 patients. All patients underwent a neurological examination by two neurologists with training and clinical experience in these examinations and in the Brief Peripheral Neuropathy Screening (BPNS), which was the primary tool used here. Data from nutritional status (body mass index: BMI), social and demographic information, HAART status, and CD4 count were recorded. The factors associated with DSP were studied with multivariate analysis, using a logistic regression model and a significance level of 0.05. The study included 60 men (22.9 %). Patients' ages ranged from 16 to 74 years and averaged 36.8±10 years. All patients but one patient were infected by HIV type 1 only; that one was coinfected by types 1 and 2.

13502,0.005,1.0000,"Neurological disorders caused by Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) are rarely reported in the Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) period. The objective of this study was to describe the main clinical and laboratory features of patients with CMV-related neurological complications in HIV-infected patients admitted to a referral center in São Paulo, Brazil. CMV disease requires the identification of the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Thirteen cases were identified between January, 2004 and December, 2008. The median age of patients was 38 years and nine (69%) were men. At admission all patients were aware of their HIV status and only four (31%) patients were on HAART. Patients who were not on antiretroviral therapy before admission received HAART while inpatients. CMV disease was the first AIDS-defining illness in eight (62%) patients. The neurologic syndromes identified were diffuse encephalitis (n = 7; 62%), polyradiculopathy (n = 7; 54%), focal encephalitis (rhombencephalitis) (n = 1; 8%), and ventriculo-encephalitis (n = 1; 8%). Seven (54%) patients presented extra-neural CMV disease and four (31%) had retinitis. The median of CD4+ T-cell count was 13 cells/µL (range: 1-124 cells/µL). Overall in-hospital mortality was 38%. Eight patients used ganciclovir or foscarnet (in-hospital mortality: 50%) and five patients used ganciclovir and foscarnet (in-hospital mortality: 20%). None of the patients fulfilled the diagnosis criteria of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Four patients were lost to follow-up, and three patients presented immune recovery and discontinued secondary prophylaxis. Although infrequent, distinct neurological syndromes caused by CMV continue to cause high mortality among AIDS patients. Survival depends upon the use of effective antiviral therapy against CMV and the early introduction of HAART."
2848,0.005,1.0000,"People living with human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection who smoke tobacco are more likely to develop several opportunistic infections, and also suffer complications from antiretroviral medication than the non smokers of tobacco. The burden of tobacco smoking amongst people living with this infection is poorly understood in the African population. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence and determinants of tobacco smoking among HIV patients in North Eastern Nigeria. We enrolled 312 adult HIV sero-positive patients attending the Federal Medical Centre Yola, Nigeria. A modified World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended questionnaire was used to obtain information from consented subjects. The prevalence of current cigarette smoking among HIV patients was 22.1%. The male to female ratio of smokers was 2:1. Peer pressure (25.8%) and pleasure (25.8%) were reported as the most common reasons for smoking tobacco. Multivariate analysis shows that male gender, age ranged 40-49 years, alcohol drinking and CD4 T lymphocyte count <200 cells/mm3 were positively associated with tobacco smoking. The prevalence of tobacco smoking among HIV patients in North Eastern Nigeria was high. Therefore, smoking should be discouraged in people living with HIV to reduce their morbidity and mortality."
3609,0.005,1.0000,"Previous work has demonstrated the existence of systemic interaction between tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and didanosine as well as between TDF and lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r). Here we investigated TDF interactions with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) lamivudine (3TC) and abacavir (ABC), comparing both the concentrations of nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors in plasma and the intracellular concentrations of their triphosphate metabolites (NRTI-TP) for human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients receiving these NRTIs with TDF and after 4 weeks of TDF interruption. We also looked at interactions between TDF-ABC and LPV/r, comparing patients receiving or not receiving LPV/r. Blood samples were taken at baseline and at 1, 2, and 4 h after dosing. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure NRTIs and NRTI-TPs. Statistical analyses were performed on pharmacokinetic parameters: the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 h (AUC(0-4)), the maximum concentration of the drug (C(max)), and the residual concentration of the drug at the end of the dosing interval (C(trough)) for plasma and the AUC(0-4) and C(trough) for intracellular data. Among the groups of patient discontinuing TDF, the very long intracellular half-life of elimination (150 h) of TFV-DP (the diphosphorylated metabolite of TFV, corresponding to a triphosphorylated species) was confirmed. Comparison between groups as well as the longitudinal study showed no significant systemic or intracellular interaction between TDF and ABC or 3TC. Significant differences were observed between patients receiving LVP/r and those receiving nevirapine. For ABC, plasma exposure was decreased (40%) under LVP/r, while, in contrast, plasma exposure to TFV was increased by 50% and the intracellular TFV-DP AUC(0-4) was increased by 59%. A trend for a gender effect was observed for TFV-DP at the intracellular level, with higher and C(trough) values for women."
2573,0.005,1.0000,"The use of enteral feeding tubes to administer antiretroviral medications is necessary in certain patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, adequacy of drug exposures after these administration routes are largely unknown, making dosing recommendations and the attainment of viral suppression challenging in this patient population. This report describes a patient with advanced HIV infection and a complicated medical history including long-term intractable nausea/vomiting necessitating antiretroviral medication administration via a Roux-en-Y jejunostomy (J)-tube. Pharmacokinetic assessments were performed to compare differences in antiretroviral drug absorption and plasma exposure following oral and J-tube administration of dolutegravir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and emtricitabine. Results were also compared with published pharmacokinetic data in HIV-infected individuals. Exposure to dolutegravir and tenofovir were similar between J-tube and oral administration routes, whereas emtricitabine exposure was 38% lower when administered via J-tube. However, in comparison with reference data in HIV-infected individuals taking these medications orally, exposure to dolutegravir and tenofovir was 75-76% and 55-61% lower, respectively, following both routes of administration. Emtricitabine exposure was similar to and 71% higher than reference data following J-tube and oral administration, respectively. This report highlights the importance of performing pharmacokinetic assessments in patients with the potential for impaired drug absorption to ensure antiretroviral treatment success."
16186,0.005,1.0000,"Tuberculosis (TB) has recently surpassed HIV as the primary infectious disease killer worldwide, but the two diseases continue to display lethal synergy. The burden of TB is disproportionately borne by people living with HIV, particularly where HIV and poverty coexist. The impact of these diseases on one another is bidirectional, with HIV increasing risk of TB infection and disease progression and TB slowing CD4 recovery and increasing progression to AIDS and death among the HIV infected. Both antiretroviral therapy (ART) and latent TB infection (LTBI) treatment mitigate the impact of coinfection, and ART is now recommended for HIV-infected patients independent of CD4 count. LTBI screening should be performed for all HIV-positive people at the time of diagnosis, when their CD4 count rises above 200, and yearly if there is repeated exposure. Tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) may perform better with serial testing than interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs). Any patient with HIV and a TST induration of ≥5 mm should be evaluated for active TB disease and treated for LTBI if active disease is ruled out. Because HIV impairs multiple aspects of immune function, progressive HIV is associated with lower rates of cavitary pulmonary TB and higher rates of disseminated and extrapulmonary disease, so a high index of suspicion is important, and sputum should be obtained for evaluation even if chest radiographs are negative. TB diagnosis is similar in patients with and without TB, relying on smear, culture, and nucleic acid amplification tests, which are the initial tests of choice. TSTs and IGRAs should not be used in the evaluation of active TB disease since these tests are often negative with active disease. Though not always performed in resource-limited settings, drug susceptibility testing should be performed on all TB isolates from HIV-positive patients. Urine lipoarabinomannan testing may also be helpful in HIV-positive patients with disseminated disease. Treatment of TB in HIV-infected patients is similar to that of TB in HIV-negative patients except that daily therapy is required for all coinfected patients, vitamin B6 supplementation should be given to all coinfected patients receiving isoniazid to reduce peripheral neuropathy, and specific attention needs to be paid to drug-drug interactions between rifamycins and many classes of antiretrovirals. In patients requiring ART that contains ritonavir or cobicistat, this can be managed by the use of rifabutin at 150 mg daily in place of rifampin. For newly diagnosed coinfected patients, mortality is lower if treatment is provided in parallel, rather than serially, with treatment initiation within 2 weeks preferred for those with CD4 counts of <50 and within 8 to 12 weeks for those with higher CD4 counts. When TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome occurs, patients can often be treated symptomatically with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but a minority will benefit from steroids. Generally, patients who do not have space-occupying lesions such as occurs in TB meningitis do not require cessation of therapy."
5728,0.005,1.0000,"According to current estimates, there are 60,000 to 80,000 HIV and HCV coinfected individuals in Spain, and 5,000 to 10,000 HIV and HBV coinfected individuals. Among these patients, 10% to 15% have liver cirrhosis. Thus, end-stage liver disease is one of the major causes of death in our country. Liver transplantation is the only therapeutic option for these patients. Accumulated experience in North America and Europe in the last five years indicates that three-year survival in HIV-positive liver transplant recipients is similar to that of HIV-negative recipients. The selection criteria for HIV transplant candidates includes the following: no history of opportunistic infections, CD4 lymphocyte count higher than 100 cells/mm3, and HIV viral load suppressible with antiretroviral treatment. In Spain, where the majority of patients are former drug abusers, complete abstinence from heroin or cocaine use during two years is also required, with the possibility of the patient being in a methadone program. To date 26 hepatic transplants have been performed in the same number of patients, with only two deaths (7%) after a median follow-up of eight months (1-28). The main problems in the post-transplantation period in all the series has been recurrent HCV infection, which is the principle cause of post-transplantation mortality, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between the antiretroviral and immunosuppressive agents. There is little experience with pegylated interferon and ribavirin treatment in this population."
14809,0.005,1.0000,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the major opportunistic infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons worldwide. Human immunodeficiency virus infection is the most potent known risk factor for reactivation of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and TB disease appears to increase the rate of HIV progression. Pulmonary disease is seen in most patients, including a large proportion of those with extrapulmonary disease. Failure to suspect TB and to order the appropriate diagnostic tests is the most common reason for diagnostic delays. With advancing HIV infection, tuberculin skin test reactivity decreases along with reactivity to nonspecific antigens such as mumps, tetanus toxoid, and Candida; anergy testing need not be a routine component of tuberculosis screening of HIV-infected persons. The diagnosis depends on identifying the organism on smears or cultures; direct amplification tests may facilitate rapid identification of M. tuberculosis, but the relatively low sensitivity in smear-negative specimens limits their use. Also, these tests must be used in conjunction with the clinical assessment, and they must always be performed in conjunction with microscopy and standard culture. Shorter courses of combination preventive therapy of patients with latent tuberculous infection are effective, but the potential advantages of improved adherence and reduced costs of shorter courses should be balanced with an increased risk secondary to ongoing TB exposure in areas with a high TB prevalence. Six months of treatment for active tuberculosis is recommended, unless the response of a particular patient is slow or otherwise suboptimal. The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) made a remarkable impact on the course or HIV disease, but raises several issues with respect to HIV-related TB. Drug interactions necessitate either a non-rifamycin-based regimen or a rifabutin-based regimen in patients on HAART treated for TB."
17148,0.005,1.0000,"Previous studies have indicated that there is a significant prevalence (50%) of hypogonadism among men with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated wasting, and for these patients testosterone administration has been shown to increase lean body mass and improve quality of life. However, the prevalence of hypogonadism is not known among men with weight loss related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). From 1997 through 1999, we investigated total and free testosterone levels in 90 men who were <90% of ideal body weight or had weight loss of >10% from preillness weight; 71% of these subjects were receiving HAART. Twenty-one percent of the subjects receiving HAART had low free testosterone levels. No correlation was seen between weight, CD4 cell count, medication status, and other clinical factors. These data suggest that hypogonadism remains relatively common in men with AIDS wasting, despite treatment with HAART. HIV-infected men with wasting syndrome should be screened for hypogonadism and receive physiological androgen replacement therapy if they are hypogonadal."
18715,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a critical problem among the incarcerated population, with rates as high as 17% being reported for prison systems in New York. The literature suggests that stressful living conditions and inherent defects in the immune system associated with HIV infection make prison populations more susceptible to a disproportionate decrease in their CD4 counts. To determine the effects of incarceration on HIV-infected individuals, the charts of 800 inmates were reviewed. Baseline (draw 1), 2- to 5-month (draw 2), and 6- to 12-month (draw 3) CD4 cell counts were obtained. Mean cell counts were calculated, and paired t-tests were used to identify differences. The group receiving antiretrovirals throughout showed no difference in mean CD4 cell count between draws 1 and 2 or between draws 1 and 3. The group not receiving HIV medications did not show a significant difference in CD4 cell counts between draws 1 and 2, but did show a significant difference between draws 1 and 3. For this group, the rate of decline in CD4 cells was greater than among an outpatient setting. The subsample of subjects initiating therapy prior to the second blood draw showed a significant increase in mean CD4 cell counts at draw 1 versus draw 2, but did not show a significant change when comparing draw 1 to draw 3. When examining subjects based on their antiviral status, the mean CD4 cell count at each of the draws was statistically associated with subjects' antiviral status. We conclude that incarceration causes a more rapid decrease in CD4 cells compared with an outpatient population, causing clinical significance on the normal course of HIV disease."
2603,0.005,1.0000,"African Americans are disproportionately affected by acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). New treatments that slow the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection offer hope for individuals living with HIV/AIDS, but lack of access to care and poor treatment adherence remain significant obstacles to HIV treatment. This study investigated the association between education literacy to HIV treatment adherence and barriers to care among African Americans living with HIV/AIDS. A community-recruited sample of 85 African-American men and 53 women receiving HIV treatment completed measures of health literacy, health status, treatment adherence, emotional well-being, and barriers to care. Nearly one-third (29%) of the participants had < 12 years of education or were functionally illiterate, and those with low-education literacy were less likely to be adherent to HIV medications within the previous two days. Lower-education literacy also was related to reasons for missing medications and barriers to accessing medical care. Individuals of law-education literacy also were more emotionally distressed, lacked social support, and were less optimistic than those with higher education. These results indicate that education and health literacy are important factors in HIV-treatment adherence and access to medical care. Interventions are needed for improving treatment adherence among law-income minorities, and such interventions will need tailoring for individuals with limited reading ability."

However, the emergence of drug resistance has resulted in the failure of treatments in large numbers of patients and thus necessitates the development of new classes of anti-HIV drugs. In this study, more than 200 plant-derived small-molecule compounds were evaluated in a cell-based HIV-1 antiviral screen, resulting in the identification of a novel HIV-1 inhibitor (fangchinoline). Fangchinoline, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from Radix Stephaniae tetrandrae, exhibited antiviral activity against HIV-1 laboratory strains NL4-3, LAI and BaL in MT-4 and PM1 cells with a 50% effective concentration ranging from 0.8 to 1.7 µM. Mechanism-of-action studies showed that fangchinoline did not exhibit measurable antiviral activity in TZM-b1 cells but did inhibit the production of infectious virions in HIV-1 cDNA transfected 293T cells, which suggests that the compound targets a late event in infection cycle. Furthermore, the antiviral effect of fangchinoline seems to be HIV-1 envelope-dependent, as the production of infectious HIV-1 particles packaged with a heterologous envelope, the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein, was unaffected by fangchinoline. Western blot analysis of HIV envelope proteins expressed in transfected 293T cells and in isolated virions showed that fangchinoline inhibited HIV-1 gp160 processing, resulting in reduced envelope glycoprotein incorporation into nascent virions. Collectively, our results demonstrate that fangchinoline inhibits HIV-1 replication by interfering with gp160 proteolytic processing. Fangchinoline may serve as a starting point for developing a new HIV-1 therapeutic approach."
19617,0.005,1.0000,"Sequential human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates, recovered from a panel of longitudinally collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 20 initially asymptomatic HIV-seropositive homosexual men, were studied for differences in replication rate, syncytium-inducing capacity, and host range. Eleven individuals remained asymptomatic; nine progressed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) at the time point at which the last HIV isolate was obtained. In 16 individuals, only non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) isolates, with a host range restricted to mononuclear cells, were observed. From four individuals, high-replicating, syncytium-inducing (SI) isolates that could be transmitted to the H9, RC2A, and U937 cell lines were recovered. From two of these four individuals, SI isolates were obtained throughout the observation period. In the two others, a transition from NSI to SI HIV isolates was observed during the period of study. Three of these four individuals developed ARC or AIDS 9 to 15 months after the first isolation of an SI isolate. With the exception of the two individuals in whom a transition from NSI to SI isolates was observed, within a given individual the replication rate of sequential HIV isolates was constant. A significant correlation was found between the mean replication rate of isolates obtained from an individual and the rate of CD4+ cell decrease observed in this individual. In individuals with low-replicating HIV isolates, no significant CD4+ cell loss was observed. In contrast, recovery of high-replicating isolates, in particular when these were SI isolates, was associated with rapid decline of CD4+ cell numbers and development of ARC or AIDS. These findings indicate that variability in the biological properties of HIV isolates is one of the factors influencing the course of HIV infection."
11320,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 infection is associated with immune deficiency and metabolic perturbations leading to malnutrition and lipodystrophy. Because immune response and metabolic perturbations (protein and lipid metabolism) are partly regulated by glucocorticoids and DHEA, we determined serum cortisol and DHEA concentrations, and the cortisol/DHEA ratio in HIV-positive men, either untreated or receiving various antiretroviral treatments (ART), including highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Cortisol levels were found increased in all patients, whatever the stage of the disease and independently of the ART treatment. In contrast, serum DHEA was elevated in the asymptomatic stage, and it was below normal values in AIDS patients, either untreated or mono-ART-treated. The DHEA level was low in HAART-treated patients with lipodystrophy (LD+) and highly increased in HAART-treated patients without lipodystrophy (LD-). Consequently, the cortisol/DHEA ratio was similar to controls in asymptomatic untreated or mono-ART-treated patients, but increased in AIDS patients. Interestingly, this ratio was increased in LD+ HAART-treated men, but normalized in LD- HAART-treated patients. Changes in the cortisol/DHEA ratio were negatively correlated with the in vivo CD4 T-cell counts, with the malnutrition markers, such as body-cell mass and fat mass, and with the increased circulating lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B) associated to the lipodystrophy syndrome. Our observations show that the cortisol/DHEA ratio is dramatically altered in HIV-infected men, particularly during the syndromes of malnutrition and lipodystrophy, and this ratio remains elevated whatever the antiretroviral treatment, including HAART. These findings have practical clinical implications, since manipulation of this ratio could prevent metabolic (protein and lipid) perturbations."
9654,0.005,1.0000,"There are few reports of the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection from Asia. In a retrospective analysis of 594 patients (72.9% male; baseline CD4 cell count, 216 cells/microL) receiving care at YRG Center for AIDS Research and Education, a tertiary HIV referral center in southern India, the mean duration of survival from serodiagnosis was 92 months. Ninety-three percent of the patients acquired infection through heterosexual contact. The most common acquired immune deficiency syndrome-defining illnesses were pulmonary tuberculosis (49%; median duration of survival, 45 months), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (6%; median duration of survival, 24 months), cryptococcal meningitis (5%; median duration of survival, 22 months), and central nervous system toxoplasmosis (3%; median duration of survival, 28 months). Persons with a CD4 lymphocyte count of <200 cells/microL were 19 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.56-64.77) more likely to die than were those with CD4 cell count of >350 cells/microL. Patients who had > or =1 opportunistic infection were 2.6 times more likely to die (95% CI, 0.95-7.09) than were those who did not have an opportunistic infection. Antiretroviral therapy for patients with low CD4 lymphocyte counts improved the odds of survival (odds ratio, 5.37; 95% CI, 1.82-15.83)."
2098,0.005,1.0000,"Determination of the infectious virus burden at the organ level is critical for understanding the pathophysiology of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. To evaluate the burden of HIV-1 in the lung, quantitative cultures were performed on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from 11 HIV-1 seropositive subjects without respiratory infections and compared with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from the same subjects. Fifty percent (50%) of subjects had positive BAL cell cultures while 82% had positive PBMC cultures. There was much less virus cultured from BAL cells than from PBMCs, whether using phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) targets (p < 0.05) or adherent monocyte targets (p < 0.02). There was no significant difference between the HIV-1 titers obtained for BAL cells whether using PHA-stimulated PBL or adherent monocyte targets (p = 0.13). These studies demonstrate that BAL cell cultures for HIV-1 in subjects without respiratory infections are less frequently positive than PBMC cultures, that less virus can be recovered from BAL cells than from PBMC, and that HIV-1 isolates from BAL cells replicate in both PHA-stimulated PBL targets and adherent monocyte targets. Quantitative assessment of virus burden in the lung is important for future studies of HIV-1 pathogenesis and for evaluating potential antiretroviral therapies aimed at altering the natural history of organ dysfunction associated with retroviral replication."
16445,0.005,1.0000,"Little is known on female sexual dysfunction (FSD) among HIV-positive women. A cross-sectional survey in seven European HIV centres was performed and data on medical history, antiretroviral treatment and laboratory results were collected. Sexual function was evaluated by the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). The data from 166 women were available (response rate=77%). The non-respondents had a lower CD4 cell count, were older and more frequently of sub-Saharan African origin. The overall median FSFI was 25.2 (interquartile range=19.3). Thirty-six women (25%) had a FSFI score < or = 10. Depression, irritability and anxiety were associated with a low FSFI score. The participants reported a significant decrease in sex functioning since HIV diagnosis but not since the start of antiretroviral treatment. Sexual dysfunction in women with HIV infection is frequent and is mainly driven by psychological factors and by the HIV diagnosis."
6238,0.005,1.0000,"To evaluate behavioral and immunologic factors related to transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by homosexual intercourse, we studied a population of 329 homosexual/bisexual men (155 partner-pairs) seen in a community health center and medical outpatient clinic. Logistic regression analysis showed that behavioral risk factors for infection in the 130 HIV-infected men included: receptive anal intercourse (OR 4.6, 95% CI-1.8, 12.1); receptive fisting (OR 2.5, CI-1.1, 7.0); nitrite use (OR 2.3, CI-1.2, 4.6); history of gonorrhea or syphilis (OR 2.3, CI-1.4, 3.9); and history of sexual contact with men from areas with many AIDS cases (OR 1.9, CI-1.0, 3.5). Comparing seven men who were probable transmitters of HIV and 11 men who had not transmitted HIV to their uninfected partners despite unprotected insertive anal intercourse, we found no differences in HIV isolation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, circulating HIV antigen detection, or presence of neutralizing antibody to HIV. Helper T-cell numbers were not significantly different between the two groups, but transmitters had more suppressor T-cells than did nontransmitters."
16893,0.005,1.0000,"Antigen presenting cell (APC) function is central to the activation of anti-viral cytotoxic T-cells and antibody production. In previous studies we have evaluated APC function in HIV-1 infected patients as the capacity to present peptide to a well defined panel of CD4 T-cell clones. We found that APC from HIV-1 infected patients were defective in the capacity to present peptide to CD4 T-cell clones. The APC defect uncovered by this method was present early in infection and worsened with increasing viral load, suggesting that it was an important determinant of progression and anti-viral efficacy. The CD4 T-cell clones were, however, found to vary in their susceptibility to the APC defect. CD4 T-cell clones that failed to respond to peptide presented by HIV + APC were 1000-fold more readily inhibited by anti-CD4 antibody than T-cell clones which consistently responded to APC from patients infected with HIV-1 (HIV + APC). An intermediate group of T-cell clones were also identified that only responded to peptide and HIV + APC from asymptomatic patients. These results suggested that the underlying mechanism for the APC defect was binding of T-cell CD4 by APC-associated gp120. In this paper we discuss the evidence to support this hypothesis."
148,0.005,1.0000,"The increased risk of heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) has prompted the search for safe and effective female-controlled vaginal microbicides. Because endogenous reverse transcription is implicated in augmenting the sexual transmission of HIV-1, potential microbicides should have the inherent ability to optimally inhibit both wild-type and drug-resistant mutant strains of HIV-1. N-[2-(2,5-dimethoxyphenylethyl)]-N'-[2-(5-bromopyridyl)]-thiourea (PHI-236) is a rationally designed non-nucleoside inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (NNRTI) that was deduced from changes in binding pocket size, shape and residue character that result from clinically observed NNRTI resistance mutations. PHI-236 displayed high-binding affinity (Ludi K(i) = 0.07 microM) for HIV-1 RT and robust anti-HIV activity against the wild type (IC50 = <0.001 microM) as well as primary clinical isolates (IC50 = 0.009-0.04 microM) carrying multiple RT gene mutations associated with NRTI and NNRTI resistance. PHI-236 displayed high-selectivity index against human vaginal and cervical epithelial cells and did not affect human sperm functions. In the humanized severe combined immunodeficient mouse model for HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), pretreatment of HIV-1 (BaL)-infected human monocytes and semen with PHI-236 prevented the systemic infection via the vaginal route. PHI-236 has particular clinical utility as a non-spermicidal microbicide as well as a prophylactic antiviral agent to inactivate cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 in semen before assisted reproductive technology procedures."
16149,0.005,1.0000,"Currently, over 15% of new HIV infections occur in children. Breastfeeding is a major contributor to HIV infections in infants. This represents a major paradox in the field because in vitro, breast milk has been shown to have a strong inhibitory effect on HIV infectivity. However, this inhibitory effect has never been demonstrated in vivo. Here, we address this important paradox using the first humanized mouse model of oral HIV transmission. We established that reconstitution of the oral cavity and upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humanized bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT) mice with human leukocytes, including the human cell types important for mucosal HIV transmission (i.e. dendritic cells, macrophages and CD4⁺ T cells), renders them susceptible to oral transmission of cell-free and cell-associated HIV. Oral transmission of HIV resulted in systemic infection of lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues that is characterized by the presence of HIV RNA in plasma and a gradual decline of CD4⁺ T cells in peripheral blood. Consistent with infection of the oral cavity, we observed virus shedding into saliva. We then evaluated the role of human breast milk on oral HIV transmission. Our in vivo results demonstrate that breast milk has a strong inhibitory effect on oral transmission of both cell-free and cell-associated HIV. Finally, we evaluated the effect of antiretrovirals on oral transmission of HIV. Our results show that systemic antiretrovirals administered prior to exposure can efficiently prevent oral HIV transmission in BLT mice."
12489,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the incidence and demographics of gastric hypoacidity among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 146 asymptomatic subjects were evaluated with use of a radiotelemetry device (Heidelberg capsule). Gastric hypoacidity (minimum gastric pH of > or = 3) occurred in 24 subjects (17%). Demographic characteristics, CD4 cell counts, and Helicobacter pylori serological status were evaluated for an association with gastric pH. Subjects with hypoacidity were more likely to have positive H. pylori serology than were subjects without hypoacidity (15 of 24 vs. 23 of 74, respectively; P = .004). Multivariate analysis indicated that a positive H. pylori serology was the most significant predictor of hypoacidity, accounting for an increase in gastric pH of 39%. A history of injection drug use, heterosexual transmission of HIV, and male gender were also associated with an elevated gastric pH. CD4 cell counts did not contribute to predictions of gastric pH. A history of H. pylori infection is relatively common in HIV-positive black and Hispanic populations and is a predictor of gastric pH."
18442,0.005,1.0000,"The presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in genital secretions may be a determinant of vertical HIV-1 transmission. Cervical and vaginal secretions from HIV-1-seropositive pregnant women were evaluated to determine prevalence and correlates of HIV-1-infected cells in the genital tract. HIV-1 DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 32% of 212 cervical and 10% of 215 vaginal specimens. Presence of HIV-1 DNA in the cervix was associated with cervical mucopus and a significantly lower absolute CD4 cell count (354 vs. 469, P < .001). An absolute CD4 cell count <200 was associated with a 9.6-fold increased odds of cervical HIV-1 DNA detection compared with a count > or = 500 (95% confidence interval, 2.8-34.2). Detection of vaginal HIV- 1 DNA was associated with abnormal vaginal discharge, lower absolute CD4 cell count, and severe vitamin A deficiency. Presence of HIV-1-infected cells in genital secretions was associated with immunosuppression and abnormal cervical or vaginal discharge."
3239,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is a leading cause of ESRD in African Americans. The HIV-1 virus infects podocytes, cells integral to formation of the glomerular filtration barrier, often leading to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. HIVAN is typically a complication of late-stage HIV infection, associated with low CD4 cell counts and elevated serum HIV RNA levels. Highly active antiretroviral therapy is partially protective and has altered the natural history of HIV-associated kidney disease. Nonetheless, HIVAN remains an important public health concern among HIV-infected African Americans. Although polymorphisms in the MYH9 gene on chromosome 22 are strongly associated with HIVAN, as well as with idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and global glomerulosclerosis (historically labeled ""hypertensive nephrosclerosis""), the majority of HIV-infected patients who are genetically at risk from MYH9 do not appear to develop severe kidney disease. Therefore, we postulate that additional environmental exposures and/or inherited factors are necessary to initiate human HIVAN. Gene-environment interactions have also been proposed as necessary for the initiation of HIVAN in murine models. It is important that these novel risk factors be identified because prevention of environmental exposures and targeting of additional gene products may reduce the risk for HIVAN, even among those harboring 2 risk alleles in MYH9."
4462,0.005,1.0000,"Several studies of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 have suggested that women have lower plasma HIV-1 RNA levels than men, even when controlling for CD4 T cell levels. A cross-sectional analysis was performed in 494 patients (21% of whom were women) who enrolled in a prospective study of anemic HIV-1-infected patients requiring transfusion. The median CD4 T cell count and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were 15 cells/microL and 4.83 log(10) copies/mL (67,350 copies/mL), respectively. In unadjusted analyses, women had slightly higher mean log HIV-1 RNA titers than men (0.19 log(10) higher copies/mL; 95% confidence interval, -0.05 to 0.44; P=.11). Adjustment for CD4 T cell count, race or ethnicity, injection drug use, and age yielded a smaller sex difference (0.13 log(10) copies/mL higher in women; P=.28). In this population of patients with very advanced HIV disease, there is no evidence that women have lower HIV-1 RNA levels than men."

Times from HHV-8 seroconversion to KS were compared for the 69 men who became infected with HHV-8 after acquiring HIV-1 to the 182 men who were HHV-8 seropositive before their HIV-1 infection. None developed KS before coinfection. HHV-8 seroconversion after HIV-1 infection increased the risk of KS (risk ratio, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-6.10) compared with those infected with HHV-8 before HIV-1. The KS hazards in HHV-8-infected men increased by 60% (P<.001) for each year of HIV-1 infection. Faster CD4 cell loss and higher HIV-1 RNA levels significantly predicted KS. The quicker development of KS in men acquiring HHV-8 after HIV-1 and its association with CD4 slope argues that KS is more likely if HHV-8 infection occurs in an immunocompromised person."

Plasma p24 antigen levels demonstrated a biphasic response, falling initially in 11 patients by a mean of 50% (95% confidence interval, 36%-64%; P = .001) at a median of 11 weeks, but rising steadily thereafter (P = .001). CD4+ cell counts fell by a mean of 7.1 cells/mm3/week (P = .01). Higher initial CD4+ counts predicted greater p24 antigen reductions. At higher interferon doses no greater reductions in p24 antigen occurred, but side effects were more severe and CD4+ lymphocyte counts fell faster. Polymerase chain reaction quantification of HIV-1 DNA in 3 patients showed a biphasic pattern paralleling the p24 antigen response. In sum, although evidence of short-term effects was found, the combination showed no evidence of lasting antiviral activity beyond that achieved with zidovudine alone in patients with advanced HIV-1 infection."
18243,0.005,1.0000,"The association of plasma human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA level at study entry and over time with clinical progression was evaluated in 187 patients from AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 116A who had little or no prior zidovudine treatment. Three-fold-higher HIV-1 RNA levels at study entry and 3-fold increases by week 8 were associated with progression (relative hazard [RH], 1.67; 95% confidence limits [CL], 1.20, 2.32; and RH, 1.45; CL, 1.02, 2.05, respectively). Having 3-fold-higher CD4 cell count at entry was independently associated with a 52% reduction in risk for progression (adjusted RH, 0.48; CL, 0.33, 0.70). When stratified by length of prior zidovudine therapy, RNA level was predictive in drug-naive patients (adjusted RH, 1.87; CL, 1.23, 2.85) but not predictive in patients with up to 16 weeks of prior therapy (adjusted RH, 1.11; CL, 0.70, 1.76). Analysis suggests that the acquisition of mutations at HIV-1 reverse transcriptase codons 215 and 74 is associated with subsequent increases in HIV-1 RNA level (relative risk, 7.00; CL, 0.86, 56.90)."

The median CD4+ cell count was 186x10(6) cells/L, and the median HIV RNA level was 5 log(10) copies/mL. After 24 months of therapy, 42 (16.5%) of 255 patients had a median CD4+ cell count increase of <100x10(6) cells/L.

2507,0.005,1.0000,"Enfuvirtide is the first fusion inhibitor to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults and children 6 years and older. The drug is a synthetic peptide derived from a naturally occurring amino acid sequence known as heptad repeat 2 (HR2) found in gp41, a viral transmembrane glycoprotein that facilitates fusion with host cells. By mimicking the activity of HR2 and competitively binding to a second region of gp41, heptad repeat 1 (HR1), enfuvirtide prevents interaction between HR1 and HR2 and inhibits the conformational change of gp41 that is necessary for fusion of virions to host cells. The safety and efficacy of enfuvirtide have been studied only in antiretroviral-experienced persons. Preliminary data from two multicenter phase III clinical trials (T-20 versus Optimized Regimen Only [TORO 1, TORO 2]) suggest that the drug is safe and efficacious in heavily pretreated subjects through 24 weeks. By week 24, in TORO 1 and TORO 2, respectively, mean changes in HIV RNA concentrations of -1.7 and -1.4 log10 copies/ml were observed in subjects receiving enfuvirtide plus an optimized background (OB) regimen, compared with changes of -0.8 and -0.7 log10 copies/ml in subjects receiving an OB regimen alone. Resistance to enfuvirtide has been identified in vitro and in vivo. Most resistant variants contain mutations in the HR1 region of gp41 (positions 36-45). In phase III clinical trials, numerous substitutions within this critical region were associated with faster time to virologic failure over 24 weeks. Overall, enfuvirtide appears to be well tolerated and acceptable to patients despite a high rate of injection site reactions (> 90%). Bacterial pneumonia and eosinophilia occurred more frequently in subjects taking enfuvirtide than in those taking an OB regimen alone in phase III trials; however, no causal relationship was established. Like most drugs with peptide structures, enfuvirtide appears to have a low potential for metabolic drug-drug interactions. The approved dosage is 90 mg twice/day by subcutaneous injection in adults and 2 mg/kg twice/day in children older than 6 years. Enfuvirtide is an addition to antiretroviral therapy since it targets a new step in the HIV life cycle. Given the complexity of its production and administration, however, it is likely to be most useful in antiretroviral-experienced patients."
3567,0.005,1.0000,"Clinical trials have shown that the prophylactic use of zidovudine and aerosolized pentamidine (or other antibiotics used as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-free human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons delays the development of AIDS, but the effectiveness of such therapy in general use in the population still remains largely undocumented. To help answer this question, the authors estimate the effectiveness of this therapy in a population-based cohort of HIV-infected homosexual and bisexual men in San Francisco. The authors use a continuous-time Markov process to model the decline of CD4+ T-lymphocytes (T4-cells) measured in cells/microliter in HIV-infected persons. The model partitions the HIV (type 1) infection period into six progressive T4-cell count intervals (stages), followed by a seventh stage: AIDS diagnosis. The authors use maximum likelihood methods to fit the model to the observed transitions for 428 HIV-infected men during June 1984 to March 1991, from the San Francisco Men's Health Study. Since zidovudine was not widely used before 1988, the model has a component that controls for calendar time-related biases. The fitted model provides statistical estimates and confidence intervals for measuring therapy effectiveness. The authors estimate that prophylactic therapy reduces the progression rate from stage 4 (T4-cell count, 350-499) to stage 5 (T4-cell count, 200-349) by a factor of 0.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.22 to 0.55); from stage 5 to stage 6 (T4-cell count < 200) by a factor of 0.33 (95% CI 0.04-0.54); and from stage 6 to 7 (AIDS) by a factor of 0.62 (95% CI 0.47-0.73). In addition, therapy started by an HIV-infected person in stage 4 is estimated to reduce the risk of developing AIDS by a factor of 0.83 (95% CI 0.46-0.94) at 6 months and 0.68 (95% CI 0.35-0.89) at 24 months after entering stage 4. Therapy started by HIV-infected persons in more advanced stages is estimated to reduce the risk of developing AIDS by factors ranging from 0.70 (95% CI 0.39-0.90), early in stage 5, to 0.28 (95% CI 0.14-0.45), late in stage 6. Thus, the prophylactic use of zidovudine and pentamidine in routine medical care has a strong, consistent, and significant effect in slowing the clinical course of HIV infection in a population-based cohort."

Of 778 HIV-1-infected individuals enrolled in the study from September 2001 to December 2003, and followed up until June 2004, 757 were tested for anti-HCV antibodies. Of these, 159 (21.0%) showed positive results for anti-HCV. Males, individuals in the 25 to 34 year age range, and individuals of lower economic levels were more likely to be seropositive for both viruses [prevalence rate (PR), 2.04; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.43-2.92; p<0.001]. The anti-HCV reactivity was also associated with blood routes of transmission (PR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.28-3.77; p<0.001), intravenous drug use (PR, 5.79; 95% CI, 4.74-7.07; p<0.001), self-reported previous sexually transmitted diseases (PR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.18-2.04; p=0.002), VDRL positivity (PR, 2.87; 95% CI, 2.40-3.43; p<0.001), and anti-HTLV I/II reactivity (PR, 5.09; 95% CI, 4.16-6.23; p<0.001). In the follow-up period, the HCV/HIV-1-co-infected patients showed a trend toward lower CD4+ T-cell counts, higher HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load and faster disease progression than patients infected only with HIV-1, but significant differences were not observed. Although there were proportionately more deaths in the HCV/HIV-1-co-infected group, the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was a string predictor of increased CD4+ T-cell counts and decreased HIV-1 RNA plasma levels, suggesting that HAART is more important to the immunological and virological outcomes in HIV-1 infection than is HCV co-infection status."

Results indicated that none of the sera were positive for HIV-1 and HIV-2 by Western blot, but one was positive for HTLV-I. The prostitutes had a significantly higher prevalence of treponemal antibody (50.8%; P less than 0.0001) than either the STD patients (12.6%) or the other subjects (5.2%). Epidemiologic data indicated that 94% of the males and females were circumcised and only 2.6% of the males used condoms. Overall, the results of this study suggested a very low prevalence of HIV-1, HIV-2, and HTLV-I infections, especially among prostitutes and STD patients, who were considered at greatest risk of contracting these retroviral infections."
4883,0.005,1.0000,"A low CD4/CD8 ratio in elderly HIV-uninfected adults is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. A subset of HIV-infected adults receiving effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) fails to normalize this ratio, even after they achieve normal CD4+ T cell counts. The immunologic and clinical characteristics of this clinical phenotype remain undefined. Using data from four distinct clinical cohorts and three clinical trials, we show that a low CD4/CD8 ratio in HIV-infected adults during otherwise effective ART (after CD4 count recovery above 500 cells/mm3) is associated with a number of immunological abnormalities, including a skewed T cell phenotype from naïve toward terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells, higher levels of CD8+ T cell activation (HLADR+CD38+) and senescence (CD28- and CD57+CD28-), and higher kynurenine/tryptophan ratio. Changes in the peripheral CD4/CD8 ratio are also reflective of changes in gut mucosa, but not in lymph nodes. In a longitudinal study, individuals who initiated ART within six months of infection had greater CD4/CD8 ratio increase compared to later initiators (>2 years). After controlling for age, gender, ART duration, nadir and CD4 count, the CD4/CD8 ratio predicted increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Hence, a persistently low CD4/CD8 ratio during otherwise effective ART is associated with increased innate and adaptive immune activation, an immunosenescent phenotype, and higher risk of morbidity/mortality. This ratio may prove useful in monitoring response to ART and could identify a unique subset of individuals needed of novel therapeutic interventions. "
13347,0.005,1.0000,"With the advent of potent combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), there has been a reduction in the incidence of wasting. However, few studies have investigated specific body composition changes associated with these treatments. This study aimed to investigate longitudinally the association of increasingly potent ART with changes in body cell mass and wasting utilizing bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA). In this longitudinal cohort study, 159 HIV-positive men were assessed semiannually from 1995 to 1997 for body composition utilizing BIA, CD4 lymphocyte count, HIV viral load, medical and depressive symptoms. Wasting was defined as body cell mass/height below the 90th percentile based on HIV positive norms. ART potency at each visit was scored utilizing published clinical guidelines, ranging from 1 (0-1 antiretrovirals) to 5 (3 or more antiretrovirals including a potent protease inhibitor). Viral resistance testing was not used. The mixed-effects model and the generalized estimating equations approaches were used to determine longitudinal correlates of body cell mass and of wasting, respectively. Over the 2 years of follow-up, potent combination ART use increased from 6% to 79%. Concurrently, a significant increase in mean body cell mass and a reduction in prevalence of wasting were seen, while total body weight, fat mass, and total body water did not change. Increasingly potent ART was associated with significant increases in body cell mass and reduction in wasting. Other significant correlates of increased body cell mass included higher CD4 count and decreased severity of HIV-related symptoms, fatigue and depression. The current study found that higher potency ART taken for relatively short term (2 years) was associated with an increase in body cell mass and a reduction in wasting and that these changes were associated with both medical (CD4, HIV symptoms) and behavioral (fatigue, depression) improvements. One caveat is this study did not distinguish among types of potent ART regimens. Given only some antiretrovirals appear linked to many body composition changes, regardless of their effect on viral load, it may be the type of regimen used that accounted for the relationship seen between viral load and body composition changes."
19225,0.005,1.0000,"Widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients has led to improved longevity with the attendant increase in noncommunicable disease prevalence including chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study documents the prevalence of CKD in a large HIV population in Southern Nigeria.This is a single center, 15-year analysis in ART-naïve patients. CKD was defined as the occurrence of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m on 2 consecutive occasions 3 to 12 months apart using the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. The Cochran-Armitage and Cuzick tests were employed to assess for trend across the years for CKD prevalence and CD4 count, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify independent associations with CKD.In all, 1317 patients (62.2% females) with mean age of 34.5 years and median CD4 count of 194 cells/μL were included. CKD prevalence was 13.4% (95%CI 11.6%-15.4%) using the CKD-EPI equation (without the race factor). Multivariable analysis identified increasing age and CD4 count <200 cells/μL as being independently associated with CKD occurrence.This study reports a high prevalence of CKD in ART-naïve HIV-infected patients. Measures to improve diagnosis of kidney disease and ensure early initiation of treatment should be integrated in HIV treatment programmes in this setting."
2218,0.005,1.0000,"Although the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has promoted the reconstitution of CD4+ T-cell count in the HIV infected population, not all patients can achieve the normalization of their immunologic functions. We analysed the variables associated with immunologic recovery, which is commonly regarded as the increase of CD4 to 350 cell/μL after a year of ART. We collected data from 3,485 patients attending a university-based HIV clinic from June 2005 to July 2014 in Shanghai, China. Logistic regression test was performed to analyse the risk factors for suboptimal CD4+ recovery following yearlong ART. The CD4+ T-cell of 723 participants (41.5% of the 1744 subjects) showed more than 350 cell/μL after one year of ART. Compared with baseline CD4 > 350 cell/μL, patients with baseline CD4 ≤ 200 cell/μL or 200 < CD4 ≤ 350 cell/μL were 42.6, 4.5 times more likely to be incomplete CD4 recovery, respectively. The risk of suboptimal immunologic recovery among patients with regimen including AZT or d4T were 2.1, 2.4 times higher compared with TDF, respectively. In our study, between optimal CD4 recovery group and suboptimal recovery group, there were no significant differences in age, gender, marital status, transmission routes, WHO stage, and CD4 recovery rates. As for the dynamic CD4 change, we found the CD4 recovery rates were 49.9% and 61.8% in the second and third year of ART, respectively. Patients who had a low level of CD4+ T-cell count (< 200 cell/μL) during the initiation of ART exhibited more difficulties recovering to a normal level. Furthermore, the regimen, including AZT or d4T, was not beneficial to CD4 recovery. So, more efforts should be made to guarantee the early diagnosis and timely treatment for HIV/AIDS patients, and simultaneously optimize antiretroviral therapy. "
1598,0.005,1.0000,"Immunological discordance in HIV-infected patients is associated with a higher risk of mortality and disease progression. Zinc is an essential micronutrient for immune function. A two-phase pilot study including a cross-sectional study to determine plasma zinc levels and a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine immunological responses after zinc supplementation was conducted in HIV-infected patients with immunological discordance in a medical school hospital. Immunological discordance was defined in patients who received antiretroviral therapy, had HIV RNA < 40 copies/mL, and a CD4(+) cell count < 200 cells/mm(3) that increased <30% from baseline after receiving ART with undetectable HIV RNA for 12 months. Of 31 patients, 12 (39%) had low plasma zinc levels (<75 μg/dL). Five of 12 patients with low plasma zinc levels and 8 of 19 patients with normal plasma zinc levels were randomized to receive zinc supplementation. The median changes in plasma zinc levels after supplementation versus placebo in patients with low plasma zinc levels were 29 versus 4.5 μg/dL, respectively. The CD4(+) cell count significantly increased (176 versus 250 cells/mm(3), P = 0.042) after zinc supplementation in patients with low plasma zinc levels. Further large-scale studies to determine long-term benefits of zinc supplementation in patients with immunological discordance are required. "
13112,0.005,1.0000,"Control of viral replication to below the level of quantification using combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) [cART] has led to a dramatic fall in mortality and morbidity from AIDS. However, despite the success of cART, it has become apparent that many patients do not achieve normalized CD4+ T-cell counts despite virological suppression to below the level of quantification (<50 copies/mL). Increasing data from cohort studies and limited data from clinical trials, such as the SMART study, have shown that higher CD4+ T-cell counts are associated with reductions in morbidity and mortality from both AIDS and serious non-AIDS (SNA) conditions, including cardiovascular disease. Enhancement of immune restoration over and above that achievable with ART alone, using a number of strategies including cytokine therapy, has been of interest for many years. The most studied cytokine in this setting is recombinant interleukin (IL)-2 (rIL-2). The purpose of this review is to describe the current status of rIL-2 as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The review focuses on the rationale underpinning the exploration of rIL-2 in HIV infection, summarizing the phase II and III findings of rIL-2 as an adjunctive therapy to ART and the phase II studies of rIL-2 as an antiretroviral-sparing agent. The phase II studies demonstrated the potential utility of continuous intravenous IL-2 and subsequently intermittent dosing with subcutaneous rIL-2 as a cytokine that could expand the CD4+ T-cell pool in HIV-1-infected patients without any significant detrimental effect on HIV viral load and with an acceptable adverse-effect profile. These data were utilized in designing the phase II studies of rIL-2 as an ART-sparing agent and, more importantly, the large phase III clinical endpoint studies of rIL-2 in HIV-1-infected adults, ESPRIT and SILCAAT. In the latter, subcutaneous rIL-2 was given intermittently (5 days of twice-daily dosing at 4.5-7.5 million international units per dose every 8 weeks) to HIV-1-infected adults receiving cART using an induction/maintenance strategy. Both studies explored the clinical benefit of intermittent subcutaneous rIL-2 with cART versus cART in HIV-infected adults with CD4+ T-cell counts > or = 300 cells/microL (ESPRIT study) and 50-299 cells/microL (SILCAAT study). Both studies showed that receipt of rIL-2 conferred no clinical benefit despite a significantly higher CD4+ T-cell count in the rIL-2 arms of both studies. Moreover, there was an excess of grade 4 clinical events in ESPRIT rIL-2 recipients. The results of the phase III clinical endpoint studies showed that rIL-2 has no place as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of HIV infection."
12655,0.005,1.0000,"Published studies have described a strong association with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) gene and ribavirin (RBV)-induced hemolytic anemia in HCV-infected patients receiving pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and RBV. This study sought to evaluate the effect of these polymorphisms on anemia, hemoglobin reduction, HCV kinetics, and treatment outcomes. Sixty-three patients coinfected with HIV and HCV and 58 patients infected with HCV only were treated with pegIFN/RBV were genotyped using the ABI TaqMan allelic discrimination kit for the 2 ITPA SNP variants rs1127354 and rs7270101. A composite variable of ITPA deficiency using both SNPs was created as previously reported. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney test or Chi square/Fishers exact test for categorical data and mixed model analysis for multiple variables. Thirty-five patients (30%) were predicted to have reduced ITPA activity. ITPA deficiency was found to be protective against the development of hemoglobin reduction >3 g/dl over the course of treatment. The rates of hemoglobin reduction >3 g/dl decreased in correlation with the severity of ITPA deficiency. ITPA deficiency was associated with slower hemoglobin decline early in treatment (week 4, P = 0.020) and rapid virologic response (RVR) at week 4 (P = 0.017) in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV. ITPA polymorphisms are associated with hemoglobin decline and in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV it is also associated with early virologic outcomes. Determination of ITPA polymorphisms may allow prediction of RBV-induced anemia and earlier initiation of supportive care to ensure optimal therapeutic outcomes."

However, the mechanism by which the IL28B single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) affects the extra-hepatic HCV immune responses and its relationship to HCV pathogenesis have not been thoroughly investigated. To examine the mechanism by which IL28B affects HCV clearance. Forty Egyptian patients with chronic HCV infection receiving an Interferon/ribavirin treatment regimen were enrolled into this study. There were two groups: non-responders (NR; n = 20) and sustained virologic responders (SVR; n = 20). The initial plasma HCV viral loads prior to treatment and IL28B genotypes were determined by quantitative RT-PCR and sequencing, respectively. Liver biopsies were examined to determine the inflammatory score and the stage of fibrosis. Colonic regulatory T cell (Treg) frequency was estimated by immunohistochemistry. No significant association between IL28B genotypes and response to therapy was identified, despite an odds ratio of 3.4 to have the TT genotype in NR compared to SVR (95 % confidence interval 0.3-35.3, p = 0.3). Patients with the TT-IL28Brs12979860 genotype (unfavorable genotype) have significantly higher frequencies of colonic Treg compared to the CT (p = 0.04) and CC (p = 0.03) genotypes. The frequency of colonic Treg cells in HCV-infected patients had a strong association with the IL-28B genotype and may have a significant impact on HCV clearance. "
539,0.005,1.0000,"Liver transplantation (LT) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals is considered to be an experimental therapy with limited reported worldwide experience, and little long-term survival data. Published data suggest that the short-term outcome is encouraging in selected patients. Here, we report our experience in 14 HIV-infected liver allograft recipients, and compare outcomes between those coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the non-HCV group. A total of 14 HIV-infected patients (12 male, 2 female, age range 26-59 years) underwent LT between January 1995 and April 2003. Indications for LT were HCV (n = 7), hepatitis B virus (HBV; n = 4), alcohol-induced liver disease (n = 2), and seronegative hepatitis (n = 1); 3 patients presented with acute liver failure. At LT, CD4 cell counts (T-helper cells that are targets for HIV) ranged from 124 to 500 cells/microL (mean 264), and HIV viral loads from <50 to 197,000 copies/mL. Nine of 12 patients were exposed to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) before LT. In the non-HCV group (n = 7), all patients are alive, all surviving more than 365 days (range 668-2,661 days). No patient has experienced HBV recurrence, and graft function is normal in all 7 patients. However, 5 of 7 HCV-infected patients died after LT at 95-784 days (median 161 days). A total of 4 patients died of complications due to recurrent HCV infection and sepsis, despite antiviral therapy in 3 of them. A total of 3 patients experienced complications relating to HAART therapy. In conclusion, outcome of LT in HIV-infected patients with HBV or other causes of chronic liver disease indicates that LT is an acceptable therapeutic option in selected patients.

Ninety-two children (36.2%) died (41 during the study, 51 during long-term follow-up). The geometric mean baseline HIV-1 RNA level was 104,626 copies/mL, and the mean CD4 cell percent was 25%. Relative risk of death (RR) was 2.1 if the baseline RNA level was >100,000 copies/mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-3.0) and was 3.0 if the baseline CD4 cell percent was <15% (95% CI, 2.2-4.0). If RNA levels increased after baseline, the RR was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3-2.6), and if the CD4 cell percent dropped to <15%, the RR was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.6-4.9). In a multivariate model, both baseline RNA level and CD4 cell percent were independently associated with mortality risk. In a time-dependent model, the RR per log10 increase in HIV-1 RNA copy numbers was 2.8 (95% CI, 2.1-3.6) and per 5 percentage point decrement in CD4 cell percent was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.2-1.5).

2282,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of HIV-1 very low-level viremia (<50 copies/ml) on the 2-year risk of virological failure. A retrospective analysis including HIV-positive patients presenting two consecutive HIV RNA below 50 copies/ml (outpatient clinic in Italy, first semester of 2010) was performed. HIV RNA was measured through real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay CAP/CTM HIV-1 version 2.0 (detection limit: 20 copies/ml) and stratified as undetectable RNA (""Target Not Detected"", TND), <20 copies/ml, 20-50 copies/ml. After 96 weeks virological failure was defined as two consecutive viral loads above 50 copies/ml. Log-rank tests and a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model were used for univariate and multivariate analysis. A total of 1,055 patients (71.4% male, 87.4% white, aged 46.7 years) were included: nadir and current CD4 cell counts were 203 cells/mm(3) (106-292) and 554 cells/mm(3) (413-713.5). HIV RNA was undetectable in 781 patients (74%), <20 copies/ml in 190 patients (18%) and 20-50 copies/ml in 84 patients (8%). Virological failure was observed in 81 patients (7.7%); at multivariate analysis detectable RNA at baseline (p=0.017), HCV infection (p=0.020), more than three pills in the regimen (p=0.003), and duration of HIV RNA <50 copies/ml below 2 years (p<0.001) were independently associated with virological failure. In 14 patients newly selected resistance-associated mutations were observed. Undetectable HIV RNA by real-time PCR is significantly associated with a lower 2-year risk of virological failure along with Ab HCV negativity, longer viral control, and lower pill burden. Studies investigating the management of residual viremia under antiretroviral treatment are warranted. "
18522,0.005,1.0000,"In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), hospitalization as a measure of morbidity has become of increasing interest. The objectives of this study were to determine clinical predictors of hospitalization among HIV-infected persons initiating HAART and to explore the impact of gender and drug use on hospitalization. The analysis was based on a cohort of HIV-positive individuals initiating HAART between 1996 and 2001. Information on hospitalizations was obtained through data linkage with the BC Ministry of Health. Cox-proportional hazard models were used to assess variables associated with time to hospitalization. A total of 1,605 people were eligible and 672 (42%) were hospitalized for one or more days. The final multivariate model indicated that there was an increased risk of hospitalization among those with high baseline HIV RNA (HR for > 100,000 copies/mL: 1.26; 95%CI: 1.16-1.59) or low CD4 cell counts (HR [95% CI] compared to > or = 200 cells/mm3: 1.62 [1.28-2.06] and 1.29 [1.07-1.56] for < 50 and 50-199 cells/mm(3), respectively).

A group of 13 patients with CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm3 after > or =9 months of combined antiretroviral treatment received interleukin (IL)-2 immunotherapy (4.5x106 IU twice daily for 5 days every 6 weeks). After only 3 cycles, their CD4 cell counts increased from 123 cells/mm3 (range, 104-134 cells/mm3) to 229 cells/mm3 (range, 176-244 cells/mm3). A marked increase was noted in the naive CD45RA subpopulation of CD4 T lymphocytes. Furthermore, the magnitude of the CD4 cell count response correlated with the baseline expression levels of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2. This study demonstrates that IL-2 immunotherapy can accelerate the recovery of CD4 lymphocytes in persons whose CD4 cell counts fail to increase rapidly in response to combined antiretroviral treatment."
13087,0.005,1.0000,"After initiation of a treatment for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection containing a protease inhibitor, immune restoration associated with increases in CD4-positive (CD4+) T lymphocyte count may be delayed. In a sample of patients who had been prescribed protease inhibitors for the first time, the authors tested to see whether there was a minimal duration of CD4+ cell count increase before the increase had an impact on the occurrence of opportunistic infections. The evolution (difference between time t and baseline) of CD4+ cell count was modeled using a mixed effects linear model. Changes in CD4+ count estimated by this model were then included as time-dependent covariates in a proportional hazards model. Finally, the authors tested for the existence of a CD4+ change x time interaction. The authors used a sample of 553 French patients first prescribed protease inhibitors in 1996 and followed for a median of 16 months. During the first 120 days, there was no association between CD4+ change and the rate of opportunistic infections. After 120 days, each 50-cell/mm3 increase in CD4+ count was associated with a 60% (95% confidence interval: 45, 72) reduction in the incidence of opportunistic infections. These results, based on modeling of CD4+ cell response, at least indirectly reinforce the concept of a delayed but possible immune recovery with the use of protease inhibitors. The findings support the potential for interruption of certain types of prophylaxis against opportunistic infections under reasonable conditions of duration of antiretroviral therapy and sustained CD4+ cell response."

Clevudine is a new pyrimidine analog with potent anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) activity in vitro. A multicenter dose-escalation study evaluated clevudine at 10, 50, 100, and 200 mg once daily for 28 days. Eligible patients had HBV DNA levels of 3 x 10(6) copies/mL or more, had not undergone nucleoside treatment, and were without human immunodeficiency or hepatitis C virus coinfection. Thirty-two patients were enrolled (5, 10, 10, and 7 patients in the 10-, 50-, 100-, and 200-mg dose groups, respectively), 81% were male, 81% Asian, and 88% were hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) positive at baseline. Median pretreatment serum HBV DNA levels ranged from 7.3 to 8.8 log(10) copies/mL. After 28 days, the median HBV DNA log(10) change from baseline was -2.5, -2.7, -3.0, and -2.6 log(10). Six months after dosing, median changes from baseline were -1.2, -1.4, -2.7 and -1.7 log(10) in the 10-, 50-, 100-, and 200-mg cohorts, respectively. Six of 27 patients lost HBeAg, and 3 of 27 patients seroconverted to HBe antibody. Clevudine was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities. A transient increase in alanine aminotransferase of up to 7.8 times the upper limit of normal (increase ranged from 20 to 186 IU/L) was observed in six patients in the 100-mg cohort, without signs of liver failure. These increases were associated with improved viral suppression. The pharmacokinetic profile of clevudine was proportional to the dose. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the tolerability and potent activity of clevudine in HBV-infected patients and support further clinical study."

Little is known about the factors associated with patients' willingness to accept providers' recommended ART changes. This multicenter prospective observational study examined factors associated with willingness to accept ART changes recommended by their providers among HIV-infected adults from six urban outpatient HIV clinics. Patients were surveyed using the Patient Attitudes about Altering Antiretroviral Therapy Survey questionnaire (PAAARTS). Factors associated with willingness to accept ART changes were assessed using a multivariate generalized estimating equation (GEE) model to account for correlated responses. The Classification and Regression Trees (CART) analysis was also performed to determine subgroups of patients with higher acceptance of change. 216 of 289 patients (75%) definitely accepted recommended changes. Odds for acceptance were 3.2, 2.3, and 2.8 times higher for patients with higher attitudes and beliefs about ART (p < 0.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.59, 6.52), patients who rated their provider's care as excellent (p < 0.05; 95% CI = 1.07, 4.78), and non-Hispanic patients (p < 0.05; 95% CI 1.03, 7.57), respectively. CART analysis showed similar results and identified that when patients had less positive attitude about ART, acceptance rates were higher for non-Hispanic patients with higher assessments of their patient-provider communication. While most patients accepted providers' recommendation for ART changes, this willingness was influenced by both patients' attitudes and beliefs about ART and their assessment of either the effectiveness of patient-provider communication or their rating of providers' care. ART acceptance rates among Hispanic patients were lower."

To study the relationship between periodontal disease and concentrations of human beta-defensin 2 (HBD-2) in the saliva of patients infected and not infected with HIV. To evaluate the association between HBD-2 salivary concentration and viral load, the TCD4+ lymphocyte count (LTCD-4+) and the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) was assessed in HIV infected patients. Concentrations of HBD-2 were measured in 48 patients not infected with HIV and 53 HIV-infected patients by ELISA, and these data were compared according to periodontal status. Within the group of HIV-infected patients, measures of HBD-2 were assessed according to viral load, LTCD-4+ count and the use of ART. Concentrations of salivary HBD-2 were associated with periodontal disease in non-HIV-infected patients. In HIV-infected patients, salivary HBD-2 was associated with serum status and the use of ART, but it was not related to the periodontal condition. The presence of HBD-2 in the saliva of HIV-infected patients showed no correlations with LTCD-4+ count or viral load. HBD-2 could be a periodontal biomarker in non-HIV-infected patients, but in HIV-infected patients, while salivary HBD- 2 was influenced by the serum status and ART use, it was not correlated with the periodontal condition."

The most commonly selected barriers were ""away from home"" (21.9%), ""simply forgot"" (19.6%), ""change in daily routine"" (19.5%), and ""fell asleep/slept through dosing time"" (18.9%). In bivariate analyses, ""too many pills to take"" (OR=0.43, p<0.001), ""wanted to avoid side effects"" (OR=0.54, p=0.001), ""felt drug was toxic/harmful"" (OR=0.44, p<0.001), ""felt sick or ill"" (OR=0.49, p<0.001), ""felt depressed/overwhelmed"" (OR=0.58, p=0.004), and ""problem taking pills at specified time"" (OR=0.71, p=0.04) were associated with a lower odds of an undetectable HIV RNA. ""Too many pills to take,"" ""wanted to avoid side effects,"" ""felt drug was toxic/harmful,"" ""felt sick/ill,"", and ""felt depressed/overwhelmed"" had the highest relative importance in explaining virologic detectability. ""Simply forgot"" was not associated with HIV RNA (OR=0.99, p=0.95) and was ninth in its relative importance. Adherence interventions should prioritize barriers with highest importance in explaining virologic outcomes rather than focusing on more commonly reported barriers. "
10218,0.005,1.0000,"HCV infection may result in serious health consequences such as chronic hepatitis C and liver cancer. In Poland, the data on the prevalence of HCV infection is limited and available information suggests an increased risk among young males. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection between medical and non medical students, and to explore probable routes of HCV transmission. The project was conducted as a cross-sectional study. The study group included medical students (IV, V and VI year) and non medical students as a control group. The subjects were examined in the period from November 2002 to January 2003, (study group: n = 221; control group: n = 129). Serum samples were tested for antibody to HCV by ELISA method and anti-HCV positive samples were verified using Western Blot Line technique. Probable routes of infection were assessed by questionnaire. Preliminary results obtained in 29% of the target group suggested, that the prevalence of positive anti-HCV among students was 2.6% (95% PU: 1.2%-4.8%). It was higher among non medical than medical students (4.7% vs 1.4%). Anti-hepatitis C virus seropositivity was associated with a history of hepatitis. Verification of 9 positive anti-HCV cases proved only 1 HCV infection. Results presented in this paper are preliminary and will be verified after obtaining data for 600 medical students and for 600 subjects in the control group."
690,0.005,1.0000,"The relationship of the neutralizing activity (NA) profile of sera from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals to the HIV viral load and the absolute CD4 count was examined. The NA of 24 serum samples against autologous isolates (AI) and HIV type 1 strain MN was examined. Three NA patterns were recognized. Nine sera neutralized both AI and MN (+/+), six sera neutralized MN but not AI (-/+), and nine sera failed to neutralize both AI and MN (-/-). The identification of the three neutralization patterns (+/+, -/+, and -/-) indicated that resistance to neutralization was progressive. A reciprocal relationship between the viral burden of the patients and the NA profiles was observed. The nine subjects with a -/- NA profile had a plasma viral load of > or =5 x 10(4) copies/ml and a cellular viral burden of > or =1,122 infectious units per million viable cells, which were significantly different from those of the other groups (P < 0.02). These patterns were independent of the phenotypic characteristics of the virus. Longitudinally, subjects with a -/- profile at baseline gained their HIV-specific NA by 24 weeks of antiretroviral therapy when this was associated with a >/=1-log(10) decline in the plasma HIV viral load. The sera from week 24 from some patients were able to neutralize both the 24-week and the baseline dominant virus isolates. A change in CD4 cell count of 50 or more in either direction predicted a -/- or +/+ profile. The verification of the autologous NA profile might be important in selecting patients who may benefit from immune-based therapies involving neutralizing monoclonal antibodies."
10469,0.005,1.0000,"Psychosocial function and adherence to antiretroviral regimen are key factors in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease management. Alexithymia (AL) is a trait deficit in the ability to identify and describe feelings, emotions and bodily sensations. A structural equation model was used to test whether high levels of AL indirectly relate to greater non-adherent behavior and HIV disease severity via psychosocial dysfunction. Blood draws for HIV-1 viral load and CD4 T-lymphocyte, along with psychosocial surveys were collected from 439 HIV positive adults aged 18-73 years. The structural model supports significant paths from: (1) AL to non-active patient involvement, psychological distress, and lower social support, (2) psychological distress and non-active involvement to non-adherent behavior, and (3) non-adherence to greater HIV disease severity (CFI = .97, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .05). A second model confirmed the intermediary effect of greater patient assertiveness on the path from AL to social support and non-active patient involvement (CFI = .94, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .05). Altogether, AL is indirectly linked with HIV disease management through it's association with poor psychosocial function, however greater patient assertiveness buffers the negative impact of AL on relationship quality with healthcare providers and members of one's social support network."
17531,0.005,1.0000,"Coinfection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Treponema pallidum may predispose to accelerated neurosyphilis. The mechanism underlying this interaction is undefined, but usually presumed to result from HIV-induced suppression of cell-mediated immunity as reflected in the CD4 T-lymphocyte count. We report a patient infected with HIV who developed aggressive neurosyphilis despite a CD4 count of 1000/mm3. The CD4 cells constituted 17% of his total lymphocytes. Our case suggests that while severe neurosyphilis can occur in HIV-infected persons with normal absolute CD4 counts, the percentage of CD4 cells may be a better indicator of the risk of neurosyphilis. These observations are relevant to designing treatment strategies for patients coinfected with HIV and T pallidum based on measures of their immunocompetence."
253,0.005,1.0000,"The global incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has decreased by 15% over the past years, but is still too high. Despite current programs to reduce the incidence of HIV infection, further approaches are needed to limit this epidemic. Oral antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is currently one of the most discussed possible prevention methods. This literature study demonstrates whether orally antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis in HIV-uninfected individuals with high-risk behaviour reduces the transmission of HIV. We used the PICO method and conducted a search to identify relevant studies. Subjects of the study were HIV-uninfected individuals with high-risk behaviour. Intervention was oral PrEP with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) alone or plus emtricitabine (FTC) versus placebo. The primary outcome was the HIV incidence among this high-risk group. Secondary outcomes were adherence to PrEP, frequency and type of adverse effects. We identified ten studies from which five randomised control trials (RCTs) were included after screening. The results from three out of five trials showed a reduction, but two trials showed no protection in acquiring HIV infection. There were no significant differences in adverse events. The adherence was different among different groups and affected the outcome of the studies. In conclusion, this prophylaxis might offer protection when used in combination with intense monitoring and guidance in uninfected individuals with a high risk of HIV acquisition. However, there are still many unresolved questions. Drug adherence seems to be a crucial factor in the effectiveness of PrEP. Therefore, individual risk behaviour remains an important determinant for success in the prevention of HIV transmission. "

Recently, an association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with malignant stromal cell tumour in young people with AIDS and past EBV infection has been described. We describe a 33-year-old heterosexual male with asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who had had an EBV infection in the past and who presented with an EBV-negative GIST. The association between EBV and malignant stromal cell tumours in young people with AIDS could not be reconfirmed in our adult patient. The relationship between EBV and malignant stromal cell tumours in AIDS patients and the possible pathogenetic role of EBV remains to be established, at least in adults."
16801,0.005,1.0000,"Infections with Bartonella (Rochalimaea) henselae can result in a variety of clinical entities, including bacillary angiomatosis in immunocompromised hosts. The fastidious nature of this bacterium has so far prevented the culture of many clinical isolates. We report the recovery of the first European B. henselae isolate associated with bacillary angiomatosis. The isolate was cultured in a frozen skin biopsy specimen from a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient and was characterized by means of biochemical, bacteriologic, immunologic, and molecular biological methods including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. This strain was compared with two B. henselae strains isolated in the United States to determine the relationship between the isolates. We found that it was phenotypically and genotypically indiscernible from B. henselae Houston-1, a blood culture isolate from an HIV-infected patient in Houston. These data suggest that one B. henselae clone is associated with human infections in Europe and the United States."
4783,0.005,1.0000,"In view of the strong association between the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), we screened 182 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infected patients over a 15-month period for serological markers to previously encountered or current STDs, most of viral etiology. The relationship between their immunological and clinical status and the prevalence of STDs was assessed and compared with that of 88 HIV-seronegative patients. Hepatitis B virus and Treponema pallidum were the most frequently occurring pathogens in both HIV-1-infected and HIV-seronegative patients. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was also observed in both groups, but no HIV-seronegative patient was infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). The Centers for Disease Control clinical staging of A1 through C3, representing asymptomatic to severe AIDS conditions, was observed in HIV-1 patients with or without STDs. A mean CD4 count of 288 cells per microliter (95% CI of 237-340 cells per microliter) in HIV-1 patients was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that in HIV-seronegative individuals with 1019 cells per microliter (95% CI of 924-1115 cells per microliter), irrespective of whether subjects in either group had previous or current STDs. The mean CD4 count of patients with a single infection from HIV-1 was not significantly different (P = 0.36) from that of HIV-1 patients with multiple infections. HIV-1 infection alone appears to be responsible for the marked immunodeficiency status of seropositive patients observed in this study."
12328,0.005,1.0000,"The majority of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) across the world occurs by heterosexual transmission and is likely mediated by virus present in genital secretions. In spite of this, infection is followed by clinical markers of the virus present in blood, which may not be representative of the virus involved in transmission. In fact, several studies have demonstrated that the genital tract represents a unique compartment for the virus. We assessed the relationship between immune system integrity, represented by CD4+ T cell counts, and the maintenance of viral compartmentalization between plasma and vaginal fluid virus in treatment naïve women from the Dominican Republic infected by the heterosexual transmission route. We cloned and sequenced cell free virus from plasma and genital fluid samples from six women to assess viral evolution, phylogenetic relatedness, and calculated co-receptor use for the C2V3 region of the envelope. Our analyses demonstrated plasma and vaginal fluid virus compartments remained intact only in samples from women with CD4+ T cell counts over 350 cells/μl. The majority of viral forms were predicted to use the CCR5 co-receptor, although several dual tropic forms were also identified. None of the clones were found to use the CXCR4 co-receptor even though many of the patients showed severe disease. Our findings lend further support to the role of an intact immune system in maintaining compartmentalization across blood and genital quasispecies and provide a compelling rationale to specifically consider genital tract viral forms in therapeutic and vaccine research."
13947,0.005,1.0000,"A significant number of people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) develop neurologic complications. The AIDS dementia complex is frequently accompanied by HIV encephalitis, which is characterized at the neuropathologic level by loss of neuronal subpopulations in the neocortex, limbic system, and basal ganglia in association with synaptic and dendritic damage, astrogliosis, and formation of microglial nodules and multinucleated giant cells. Recent studies have shown that the extent of neurodegeneration in this condition correlates directly with the amount of HIV-1 antigen in the brain. HIV-1 infection of the brain could result in neurodegeneration via neurotoxic effects of viral products (e.g., gp 120, Nef, Tat) and/or via alterations in the expression of host factors. The latter may include increased production of potentially detrimental factors such as cytokines, excitotoxic amino acids, free oxygen radicals, and bioactive lipid mediators as well as interference with the production or action of neurotrophic/protective factors. Derangements of the neuronal calcium homeostasis, lipid peroxidation, and induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis) may all play a role as final common pathogenetic pathways in HIV-1-induced neurodegeneration. Recent studies in transgenic mice (over)expressing HIV- or host-derived proteins in their central nervous system indicate that distinct neuronal populations may differ in their susceptibility to specific pathogenic factors. For example, glutamate-receptor-bearing pyramidal neurons were particularly susceptible to neurodegeneration promoted by HIV-1 products, whereas interneurons were more sensitive to the neurotoxic effects mediated by cytokines. For the design of effective treatments for the HIV-1-associated cognitive/motor complex, it will be important to determine whether the neurologic deficits in this entity result from global neuronal dysfunction or relate more specifically to the impairment of distinct neuronal subpopulations. It will also be critical to examine diverse in vitro and in vivo models to help decide which of the many pathogenetic processes that may be at work in this complex disease constitute the most promising therapeutic targets."
1089,0.005,1.0000,"In the present study, we assessed whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genetic compartmentalization was associated with phenotypic CCR5 (R5) or CXCR4 (X4) coreceptor usage differences between the systemic and the genital viral populations. Four clinically asymptomatic and treatment-naïve clade A HIV-1-infected patients were selected from a cohort of 274 African women, because they were free of all the biological cofactors known to modify the kinetics of viral production in the genital tract. HIV RNA envelope sequences (V1 to V3) derived from plasma and cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) were amplified, subcloned, and sequenced. CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptor usage was determined by production of recombinant viral particles, followed by single-cycle infection assays of indicator cell lines, using the tropism recombinant test. In these four selected patients, CVS-derived sequences appeared to be genetically distinct from blood-derived sequences (P < or = 0.001). Two patients were found to harbor virus populations with only the R5 phenotype in both compartments, whereas viruses using CXCR4 in addition to CCR5 were detected in two other patients. In particular, one woman harbored genital virus populations with mixed R5 and X4 phenotypes associated with peripheral blood populations with only the R5 phenotype. These results demonstrate genetic compartmentalization of HIV between the plasma and genital secretions of clinically asymptomatic, treatment-naïve, clade A-infected women. Also, for one patient, we report phenotypic coreceptor usage differences between the systemic (R5) and genital (R5/X4) viral populations. These features may be critical for the development of further mucosal vaccines, therapies, or new preventive strategies to block heterosexual transmission."
12300,0.005,1.0000,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and the resultant Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic are major global health challenges; hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection has made the HIV/AIDS epidemic even worse. Interleukin-27 (IL-27), a cytokine which inhibits HIV and HCV replication in vitro, associates with HIV infection and HIV/HCV co-infection in clinical settings. However, the impact of HIV and HCV viral loads on plasma IL-27 expression levels has not been well characterized. In this study, 155 antiretroviral therapy-naïve Chinese were recruited. Among them 80 were HIV- and HCV-negative healthy controls, 45 were HIV-mono-infected and 30 were HIV/HCV-co-infected. Plasma level HIV, HCV, IL-27 and CD4+ number were counted and their correlation, regression relationships were explored. We show that: plasma IL-27 level was significantly upregulated in HIV-mono-infected and HIV/HCV-co-infected Chinese; HIV viral load was negatively correlated with IL-27 titer in HIV-mono-infected subjects whereas the relationship was opposite in HIV/HCV-co-infected subjects; and the relationships between HIV viral loads, IL-27 titers and CD4+ T cell counts in the HIV mono-infection and HIV/HCV co-infection groups were dramatically different. Overall, our results suggest that IL-27 differs in treatment-naïve groups with HIV mono-infections and HIV/HCV co-infections, thereby providing critical information to be considered when caring and treating those with HIV mono-infection and HIV/HCV co-infection.

10453,0.005,1.0000,"India has a large number of patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the third largest population of this group in the world. This disease was first described in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia in 1981. Ocular lesions can occur at any stage of the disease but are more commonly seen at the late stages. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of AIDS is a retrovirus with RNA genome and a unique 'Reverse transcriptase enzyme' and is of two types, HIV-1 and 2. Most human diseases are caused by HIV-1. The HIV-1 subtypes prevalent in India are A, B and C. They act predominantly by reducing the CD4+ cells and thus the patient becomes susceptible to opportunistic infections. High viral titers in the peripheral blood during primary infection lead to decrease in the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Onset of HIV-1-specific cellular immune response with synthesis of HIV-1 specific antibodies leads to the decline of plasma viral load and chronification of HIV-1 infection. However, the asymptomatic stage of infection may lead to persistent viral replication and a rapid turnover of plasma virions which is the clinical latency. During this period, there is further decrease in the CD4+ counts which makes the patient's immune system incapable of controlling opportunistic pathogens and thus life-threatening AIDS-defining diseases emerge. Advent of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) has revolutionized the management of AIDS though there is associated increased development of immune recovery uveitis in a few of these patients."
5343,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy has been effective in lowering viral loads in the peripheral blood, restoring immune function and reducing the incidence of opportunistic infections and dementia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. However, motor and cognitive deficits and peripheral neuropathy continue, with some studies reporting an increase in prevalence of nervous system disease. The authors developed an accelerated, consistent simian model of HIV infection in which pigtailed macaques are dual inoculated with a neurovirulent simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) clone and an immunosuppressive SIV strain. Infected animals invariably develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and over 90% develop central nervous system disease as well as peripheral nervous system disease with neurodegeneration by 3 months postinoculation. This model provides outstanding opportunities to delineate the pathogenesis of infection, to study the regulation of virus gene expression, and to identify host immune responses throughout the acute, clinically silent and late stages of infection. Using this model, the authors have demonstrated that the virus enters the brain within days after inoculation, that CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP]-1) plays a major role in recruiting monocytes/macrophages to the brain, and that type I interferons are critical in suppressing early virus replication and inducing viral latency. This model provides a rigorous platform for the testing of potential antiretroviral, immune reconstituting, and/or neuroprotective agents and already has been used to confirm the neuroprotective properties of minocycline, which now is being tested in clinical trials of HIV-infected individuals."
14147,0.005,1.0000,"A flow cytometric assay has been developed to detect and quantitate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from HIV-seropositive patients. Peripheral blood was obtained from patients attending an acquired immune deficiency syndrome clinic, and mononuclear cells were separated by centrifugation onto Ficoll-Hypaque. The cell layer at the interface was removed, washed in phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+, and fixed with 90% methanol, and intracellular HIV antigens were detected by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies to HIV antigens as the primary antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G F(ab')2 antibody as the secondary antibody. DNA content was determined by propidium diiodide staining after RNase treatment. These fluorochrome-treated cells were analyzed for two-color fluorescence by flow cytometry. The results showed that HIV-infected cells in peripheral blood that have been treated with monoclonal antibodies to the p24 or nef antigens of HIV can be detected and quantitated by flow cytometry. The percentage of p24 antigen-positive mononuclear cells had a significant correlation (P = 0.0001) with the clinical status of the patient, i.e., those with a high percentage of p24 antigen-positive cells had a poorer prognosis than those with a lower percentage of p24 antigen-positive mononuclear cells. In addition, for those in Centers for Disease Control groups III and IV, there was an inverse correlation between the percentage of p24 antigen-positive mononuclear cells and the number of T4 cells. However, cell-associated antigen detection by flow cytometry did not correlate with detection of antigen in sera of HIV-seropositive patients by the standard antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This lack of correlation was probably due to the presence of immune complexes in the sera of HIV-seropositive patients. These results suggest that flow cytometry can be used as a rapid, sensitive, and quantitative assay system for the determination of the antigen status of HIV-seropositive patients and that it may be more useful as an indicator of disease progression than the currently used antigen detection methods."
1983,0.005,1.0000,"Although epigenetics is not a new field, its implications for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) research have not been explored fully. To develop therapeutic and preventive approaches against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS, it is essential to understand the mechanisms of interaction between the virus and the host, involvement of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, characterization of viral reservoirs, and factors influencing the latency of the virus. Both methylation of viral genes and histone modifications contribute to initiating and maintaining latency and, depending on the context, triggering viral gene repression or expression. This chapter discusses progress made at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), recommendations from the International AIDS Society Scientific Working Group on HIV Cure, and underlying epigenetic regulation. A number of epigenetic inhibitors have shown potential in treating AIDS-related malignancies. Epigenetic drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and their implications for the eradication of HIV/AIDS and AIDS-related malignancies also are discussed.Past and current progress in developing treatments and understanding the molecular mechanisms of AIDS and HIV infection has greatly improved patient survival. However, increased survival has been coupled with the development of cancer at higher rates than those observed among the HIV/AIDS-negative population. During the early days of the AIDS epidemic, the most frequent AIDS-defining malignancies were Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Now, with increased survival as the result of widespread use in the developed world of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), non-AIDS defining cancers (i.e., anal, skin, and lung cancers, and Hodgkin disease) are on the increase in HIV-infected populations. The current status of AIDS-related malignancies also is discussed. "
1041,0.005,1.0000,"We present herein a case report of a 59-year-old patient with HIV-1 infection who developed a CMV-induced pseudotumor of the duodenum. The patient presented with oral pain and dysphagia. Physical examination revealed oral thrush. An EIA and a Western blot assay for antibodies to HIV were positive. His CD4-positive lymphocyte count was initially 49/microL with an HIV viral load of 2.6 x 10(5) copies/mL. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation was detected with the CMV antigenemia assay. He had CMV retinitis in both eyes with unilateral blurring. An endoscopic study revealed candida esophagitis, and a tumor-like lesion with an irregular ulcer at the papilla of Vater. Histological and immunohistochemical studies revealed a CMV-induced pseudotumor and severely inflamed duodenal mucosa with infiltration of CMV-positive cells. The patient was treated with oral valganciclovir and fluconazole for three weeks. As the oral thrush and retinitis showed improvement, he began antiretroviral therapy (ART), consisting of raltegravir and TDF/ FTC. One month later the patient's CD4-positive cells increased to 130/microL and the level of HIV-RNA decreased to 160 copies/mL, The CMV retinitis had transiently worsened because of an ART-induced inflammatory response, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Six months after the ART initiation, an endoscopic study revealed that the esophagitis and the lesion at the papilla had improved. Biopsy showed no CMV-positive cells in the epithelium. The patient was now in a relatively healthy condition. CMV-induced pseudotumors of the duodenum are rare, and sometimes resemble malignancy. However, because this tomor responds to medical treatment physicians treating severely immunocompromised patients should be aware of its presentation and treatment."
954,0.005,1.0000,"The total number of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes is considered to be a reflection of the HIV burden at any given time during the course of HIV infection. However, the low frequency of HIV-infected circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes and the low level or absence of plasma viremia in the early stages of infection do not correlate with the progressive immune dysfunction characteristic of HIV infection. In this study, we have determined whether HIV-infected circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes are a correct reflection of the total pool of HIV-infected CD4+ T cells (i.e., HIV burden). To this end, HIV burden has been comparatively analyzed in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues (lymph nodes, adenoids, and tonsils) from the same patients. The presence of HIV-1 DNA in mononuclear cells isolated simultaneously from peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues of the same patients was determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification. We found that the frequency of HIV-1-infected cells in unfractionated or sorted CD4+ cell populations isolated from lymphoid tissues was significantly higher (0.5-1 log10 unit) than the frequency in peripheral blood. Comparable results were obtained in five HIV seropositive patients in the early stages of disease and in one patient with AIDS. These results demonstrate that a heavy viral load does reside in the lymphoid organs, indicating that they may function as major reservoirs for HIV. In addition, the finding of a heavy viral load in the lymphoid organs of patients in the early stages of disease may explain the progressive depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes and the immune dysfunction associated with the early stages of HIV infection."
2685,0.005,1.0000,"Didanosine is a dideoxynucleoside analogue which undergoes intracellular conversion to the putative active triphosphate metabolite. The active metabolite appears to inhibit viral reverse transcriptase and terminate the proviral DNA, and produces virustatic inhibition of actively replicating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at clinically relevant concentrations. In phase I studies didanosine had beneficial effects on various surrogate markers of clinical efficacy and also improved clinical manifestations of HIV infection, with a 21-month survival rate of 80% in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 93% in patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC) in 1 study. Didanosine also improved CD4+ cell counts in a phase II/III trial in patients previously treated with zidovudine, whereas cell counts declined in patients continuing zidovudine therapy. However, the effects of didanosine on clinical end-points (disease progression, survival, HIV encephalopathy) remain to be established. Peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis are the predominant dose-limiting adverse events and didanosine therapy should be withdrawn in patients developing signs or symptoms of pancreatitis and during acute treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. However, at currently recommended clinical dosages didanosine is generally well tolerated with minimal haematological toxicity. Thus, in a therapeutic area with few treatment options, didanosine offers a welcome alternative for patients intolerant of, or resistant to, zidovudine. There are a number of clinical trials in progress evaluating didanosine alone or in combination with other antiviral agents, and these results are awaited with considerable interest."
646,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease is commonly associated with deficits in prospective memory (PM), which increase the risk of suboptimal health behaviours, like medication non-adherence. This study examined the potential benefits of a brief future visualisation exercise during the encoding stage of a naturalistic PM task in 60 young adults (aged 19-24 years) with HIV disease. Participants were administered a brief clinical neuropsychological assessment, which included a standardised performance-based measure of time- and event-based PM. All participants were also given a naturalistic PM task in which they were asked to complete a mock medication management task when the examiner showed them the Grooved Pegboard Test during their neuropsychological evaluation. Participants were randomised into: (1) a visualisation condition in which they spent 30 sec imagining successfully completing the naturalistic PM task; or (2) a control condition in which they repeated the task instructions. Logistic regression analyses revealed significant interactions between clinical neurocognitive functions and visualisation. HIV positive (HIV+) participants with intact retrospective learning and/or low time-based PM demonstrated observable gains from the visualisation technique, while HIV+ participants with impaired learning and/or intact time-based PM did not evidence gains. Findings indicate that individual differences in neurocognitive ability moderate the response to visualisation in HIV+ young adults. The extent to which such cognitive supports improve health-related PM outcomes (e.g., medication adherence) remains to be determined."
18330,0.005,1.0000,"Little is known about the immunological and virological impact of diagnosis disclosure among HIV-positive children and adolescents. The current cross-sectional study examined medication hiding as a mediator of the relationship between disclosure to friends and three medical outcomes: CD4+ absolute count, CD4+ percentage, and viral load. Participants included 25 perinatally infected, HIV-positive children and adolescents ages 11-18 years from the US. Diagnosis disclosure and medication hiding were self-reported by participants and medical markers were derived from blood samples drawn during the same clinic visit. Bootstrapping analyses revealed that disclosure to at least one friend (versus no friends) was associated with less medication hiding, which was associated with higher CD4+ absolute counts and percentages but not viral load. Further, among the subset of participants who had disclosed to at least one friend (n = 19), those who reported disclosing to 11 or more versus 1-10 friends were less likely to hide medication taking, which was associated with higher CD4+ absolute counts. Findings suggest HIV-positive children and adolescents' diagnosis disclosure to friends corresponds to less medication hiding, ultimately yielding better immune functioning. Health care providers should be cognizant of these potential medical benefits associated with disclosure when offering support around disclosure decision-making."
1364,0.005,1.0000,"HIV coinfection is associated with faster progression of liver disease resulting from hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Thus, liver complications have become a major cause of illness and death in coinfected patients. Controlling HIV through highly active antiretroviral therapy may slow disease progression to nearly the rate of HIV-negative persons. Several antiretroviral regimens have been associated with drug-induced liver injury, however, which is more common in patients coinfected with hepatitis B or C. After development of cirrhosis and decompensation, survival is shorter in coinfected patients. Diagnosis and management of cirrhosis should be the same for coinfected and monoinfected HBV/HCV patients. The main complications of cirrhosis are ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, bleeding esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, the hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver transplantation is feasible in patients with HIV infection, and early evaluation for this option is crucial because of the accelerated course of complications in HIV coinfection."
11845,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are known to be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we investigated the prevalence of the newly described hepatitis G virus (HGV) in patients with HCC. The sera of 85 patients (66 male, 19 female, 61 +/- 11 years) with HCC were studied for the presence of HGV RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Seventeen (20%) of 85 patients with HCC, 10 (16%) of 61 patients with chronic hepatitis B without HCC and 14 (20%) of 68 patients with chronic hepatitis C without HCC were infected with HGV, a significantly higher proportion when compared with two (2%) of 85 healthy controls (P < 0.01). When grouped according to the underlying cause of liver disease, HCC patients with HBV infection (33%), HCV infection (21%), alcoholic liver disease (17%), or cryptogenic cirrhosis (15%) had similar serum levels of HGV RNA. Four of the 17 (24%) HGV-positive patients with HCC were coinfected with HBV and six (35%) with HCV; thus, 59% of HGV-positive patients with HCC were coinfected with other hepatotropic viruses. Seven (41%) HGV-positive patients were infected with HGV only. Patients with HGV infection were more likely to have a history of blood transfusion than patients without HGV infection (P = 0.024). Hence, the prevalence of HGV is significantly higher in patients with HCC in comparison with the healthy population."
10151,0.005,1.0000,"The occurrence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease and hepatitis C is common in injection drug users, most of whom are opioid dependent. Methadone pharmacotherapy has been the most widely used treatment for opioid addiction in this population. Methadone has significant, adverse drug-drug interactions with many antiretroviral therapeutic agents that can contribute to nonadherence and poor clinical outcomes in this high-risk population. The present article summarizes current knowledge about interactions between methadone and antiretroviral medications. Buprenorphine is the newest agent available for the treatment of opioid dependence and may have fewer adverse interactions with antiretroviral agents. Buprenorphine has a significant pharmacokinetic interaction with efavirenz but no pharmacodynamic interaction; therefore, simultaneous administration of these drugs is not associated with opioid withdrawal, as has been observed with methadone. This promising finding may simplify the treatment of opioid-dependent patients with HIV disease and should also improve clinical outcomes for persons coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus."
13835,0.005,1.0000,"Coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals as a result of shared routes of transmission, and this coinfection represents a special challenge. For HIV-HCV-coinfected individuals, the burden of disease is largely related to their HCV diseases, including a faster progression to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver-related deaths. In the present thesis we investigated factors associated with spontaneous resolution and progression of HIV-HCV coinfection. In study I, we identified the study cohort of 327 individuals with HIV-HCV coinfection and a rate of spontaneous HCV resolution of 23%. We showed that female sex, coinfection with hepatitis B virus and individuals exposed through injecting drug use (IDU) or homosexual contact (MSM) had an increased rate of spontaneous HCV resolution. We speculate that differences in resolution rate may be caused by immunological memory induced by repeatedly being exposed to low-dose inoculum of HCV. In study II, we found three single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) in the interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene associated with spontaneous HCV resolution in 208 Europeans of Caucasian origin with HIV-HCV coinfection. Further, we showed that the IL28B CC genotype favourable of HCV resolution was associated with a higher HCV viral load (VL) than non-CC genotypes. These results may indicate an influence of IL28B in viral control. In study III, we conducted a survival analysis in the 264 HIV-HCV-coinfected individuals with chronic infection. We showed in a time-updated Poisson regression that HCV VL, HCV genotype 3 and IL28B CC genotype were predictors of increased mortality. This may indicate a need for closer observation in HIV-HCV-coinfected individuals with HCV genotype 3 and maybe even initiation of antiviral therapy. "
19858,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is characteristically associated with hypergammaglobulinemia in both adult and pediatric cases. We report herein four infants who had an HIV infection in association with severe hypogammaglobulinemia and did not exhibit antibodies against HIV. HIV was isolated antemortem or postmortem in all four infants from either peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or body tissues. HIV infection could be presumed to be acquired transplacentally in two infants and by way of infected blood transfusions during the neonatal period in the other two. Each infant became symptomatic within the first year of life and developed rapidly progressive manifestations of the disease. Features that were common to all four infants include premature birth, failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, and progressive neurological abnormalities that were associated with intracranial calcifications. We concluded that, when infection occurs early in development either by transplacental exposure to the virus or from blood transfusion in small premature infants, hypogammaglobulinemia and deficiency of antibody production leading to the absence of antibody responses on which diagnosis is usually based can occur. Furthermore, progressive central nervous system disease may be a frequent finding in such infants, and this may lead to cerebral calcifications that must be attributed to the HIV infection itself and not to complicating infections--e.g., toxoplasmosis. It is suggested that patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, antibody deficiency syndrome, and central nervous system disease have an extremely bad prognosis."
7971,0.005,1.0000,"In the United States, approximately 30% of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients are also infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Both viruses share similar routes of transmission. Unlike HIV or hepatitis B virus, HCV is curable if treated and the patient achieves a sustained virologic response. The impact of coinfection includes greater morbidity and mortality, with higher rates of opportunistic disease, development of cirrhosis, and death. The standard of treatment for HIV-HCV coinfection is similar to that for HCV monoinfection and consists of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin. As with HCV monoinfection, the best predictor of response to therapy for HIV-HCV coinfection is infection with an HCV genotype other than genotype 1 or 4. Adherence to treatment is critical for improving response to HCV therapy. However, considerable toxicities are associated with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin and pose particular problems in the coinfected patient. Coinfected patients are more likely to experience significant weight loss with HCV therapy. Neutropenia and anemia are both common laboratory abnormalities that necessitate dosage reductions and are concerns for development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining events. The effect of CD4(+) cell count has been evaluated both as a factor in response to HCV therapy and in stratification of risk for infection. Immunosuppression is not a contraindication to HCV therapy, although CD4(+) counts above 350 cells/mm(3) are associated with increased response rates in patients with HCV genotype 1 coinfection. Antiretroviral therapy does need to be adjusted to minimize adverse effects. Concomitant use of zidovudine is contraindicated because of its profound exacerbation of bone marrow suppression. The use of didanosine is also not indicated during HCV therapy because of the risks of hepatic decompensation. Controversy exists regarding the use of abacavir. Newer agents for HCV include the protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir. Although results with the protease inhibitors are highly encouraging, their effects in coinfected patients have not been evaluated. Treatment for HCV in patients with HIV poses potential obstacles to success, but the benefits of viral eradication warrant the challenge of therapy."
12338,0.005,1.0000,"The availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy has markedly improved the survival rate and quality of life in patients infected with HIV. At present, however, there is still no cure for HIV and those undergoing treatment have to do so for life. The use of antiretroviral drugs has been associated with several toxicities that limit their success. Some acute and chronic toxicities associated with these drugs include hypersensitivity reactions, neurotoxicity, nephropathy, liver damage, the appearance of body fat redistribution syndrome and the different metabolic alterations that accompany it. Some of these toxicities are family- or even drug-specific. Since not all patients that take a particular antiretroviral medication develop the adverse effect that has been attributed to that drug, it has therefore been postulated that there must be a genetically-conditioned individual predisposition to developing the adverse effect. Pharmacogenetics is the science that studies interindividual variations in the response to and toxicity of drugs due to variations in the genetic composition of individuals. Sufficient advances have been made in this discipline to allow this fertile field of research to move out of the basic science laboratory and into clinical applications. The present article reviews the investigations that have been published regarding the association between the genetic determinants of persons infected with HIV and the metabolic toxicity and chronic vascular consequences resulting from antiretroviral drugs. The influence of host genetic variants on dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, lipodystrophy and atherosclerosis are presented and discussed."
19361,0.005,1.0000,"We developed a mathematical simulation model to anticipate outcomes from an upcoming trial of targeted, preemptive cytomegalovirus (CMV) therapy in high-risk, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients identified by means of CMV polymerase chain reaction screening. We estimated the costs and consequences of CMV prophylaxis in patients with CD4(+) counts < or =100 cells/microL under various assumptions regarding disease progression, complication rates, drug effects, and costs. Without CMV preemptive therapy, lifetime costs average $44,600 with expected duration of survival of 19.16 quality-adjusted life-months and 213 CMV cases per 1000 patients. Targeted preemptive therapy with orally administered valganciclovir increases costs and duration of survival to $46,900 and 19.63 quality-adjusted life-months, respectively. CMV cases decrease to 174 per 1000 patients. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained is $59,000. This result compares favorably with other strategies in end-stage HIV disease but hinges on valganciclovir cost and efficacy assumptions and the absence of minimally effective salvage antiretroviral therapy for HIV. The upcoming trial should resolve the clinical uncertainty surrounding some of these assumptions."
2629,0.005,1.0000,"A nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) is the common antiviral drug available for directly treating hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, its application has led to the emergence of NA-resistant mutations mostly in a conserved region of the reverse transcriptase domain of HBV polymerase. Harboring NA-resistant mutations decreases drug effectiveness and increases the frequency of end-stage liver disease. The invention of next-generation sequencing that can generate thousands of sequences from viral complex mixtures provides opportunities to detect minor changes and early viral evolution under drug stress. The present study used ultra-deep sequencing to evaluate discrepant quasispecies in the reverse transcriptase domain of HBV including NA-resistant hotspots between seven treatment-naïve Indonesian patients infected with HBV and five at the early phase of treatment. The most common sub-genotype was HBV B3 (83.34%). The substitution rate of variants determined among amino acids with a ratio of ≥ 1% changes was higher among the population in conserved regions (23.19% vs. 4.59%, P = 0.001) and in the inter-reverse transcriptase domain (23.95% vs. 2.94%, P = 0.002) in treatment naïve, than in treated patients. Nine hotspots of antiviral resistance were identified in both groups, and the mean frequency of changes in all patients was < 1%. The known rtM204I mutation was the most frequent in both groups. The lower rate of variants in HBV quasispecies in patients undergoing treatment could be associated with virus elimination and the extinction of sensitive species by NA therapy. The present findings imply that HBV quasispecies dynamically change during treatment. "
17606,0.005,1.0000,"The prognosis of HIV infection has dramatically improved in recent years with the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy. Currently, liver disease is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality, even more so given the high rate of hepatitis C virus co-infection in countries where drug abuse has been an important HIV risk factor. Survival of HIV-co-infected patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) is poor and shorter than that of the non-HIV-infected population. One-year survival of HIV-infected patients with ESLD is only around 50-55%. HIV infection is no longer a contraindication to transplantation, which is becoming a standard therapy in most developed countries. The HIV criteria used to select HIV-infected patients for liver transplantation are quite similar in Europe and North America. Current criteria state that having had an opportunistic infection (e.g. tuberculosis, candidiasis, PCP) is not a strict exclusion criterion. However, patients must have a CD4 count above 100 cells/mm3 and a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load that is suppressible with antiretroviral treatment. More than 200 orthotopic liver transplants (OLT) in HIV-infected patients have been published in recent years and the mid-term (3-year) survival was similar to that of HIV-negative patients. The main problems in the post-transplantation period are the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between antiretroviral and immunosuppressive agents and the recurrence of HCV infection, which is the principal cause of post-transplantation mortality. There are controversial results regarding mid-term survival of HIV-HCV co-infected patients compared with HCV mono-infected patients. However, one study showed a trend of poorer 5-year survival of HIV-HCV co-infected patients. There is little experience with the treatment of recurrent HCV infection. Preliminary studies showed rates of sustained virological response ranging between 15% and 20% in HIV-HCV co-infected recipients. Liver transplantation in HIV-HBV co-infected patients had a good prognosis because HBV recurrence can be successfully prevented using immunoglobulins and anti-HBV drugs. Finally, this field is evolving continuously and the indications for liver transplantation or the management of HCV co-infection may change in the future as more evidence becomes available."
8745,0.005,1.0000,"This study assessed health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) recipients aged 18 or older and associated factors, 2 years after HAART administration had started in Kagera, Tanzania. Using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), 329 HAART recipients were interviewed in May 2007. Questions on sociodemographic characteristics, chronic diseases (besides HIV/AIDS), HAART side effects and adherence to antiretroviral drugs were added. Treatment data, the first and latest available CD4 counts were retrieved from patients' records. Gender and age-adjusted mean scale scores of the sample were compared to those of the general Tanzanian population of the late 1990 s using t test. Logistic regression was used to explore the effect of sex, age, education level, income, chronic diseases, CD4 count, HAART side effects and adherence to antiretroviral drugs on recipients' physical functioning and mental health scale scores. The mean scale scores of HAART recipients were generally lower than those of the general population except for general health perceptions (p = 0.191) and mental health (p = 0.161). HAART recipients with chronic disease comorbidity were more likely to score below the general population's mean score for mental health (p = 0.007). While the effect of chronic disease comorbidity on physical functioning among those who recorded a CD4 count increase was negative (odds ratio [OR] = 13.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.7, 49.9), there was no effect on those who did not have such an increase. The control of chronic diseases among recipients should be given priority to improve their HRQOL."

6575,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection among HIV positive patients, to identify most relevant risk factors of co-infection and develop preventive interventions. Study participants were voluntary individuals 18 years of age or older recruited from AIDS Center VCT unit in Tbilisi, Georgia. Eligibility criteria of participants were: HIV positive result confirmed by western blot; age; and voluntary participation. Total 175 patients undergo interview with specially designed questionnaires. Most of the participants were male (71.4%), age range of HIV positives varied from 20 to 77 years old. Prevalence of HCV among HIV positive patients is high. Almost half (48.57%) HIV positive patients are co-infected with HCV. Men were more likely than women co-infected with HCV (60.80% and 18% accordingly). Major risk factor of male co-infection was related to drug use, needle and injection equipment sharing. Prevalence of HCV among injecting drug users was (73.40%). Drug users had 3.25 times more risk (PR 3.25; 95%CI; CL--1.89-5.26; p<0.01) to be infected with HCV compare non IDUs. Prevalence of being infected with HBV (Anti-HBc) among HIV positives was 43.42% (76/175) and the prevalence of Chronic HBV (HBsAg positive) was 6.86% (12/175). Prevalence rate of HBsAg among IDUs was 8.51% and among non IDU participants 5.26%. Triple infection (HIV, Hepatitis C and chronic form of Hepatitis B--HBsAg) was among 9 patients (5.14%). Infections were associated with injection drug use (88.88%) and mostly were related to share of needles/syringes and other injecting medical equipment. Transmission of HBV and HCV by sexual contact was not observed among those 9 participants. High risk behavior among HIV positive participants mostly related to drug use and unprotected sex with non regular partners. Other risk factors for Hepatitis transmission were associated with invasive medical manipulations, blood transfusion, surgery, abortions and etc. None of cases of HIV, or Hepatitis (B, C) transmission through medical manipulations can be documentary proved based on those research data."
4729,0.005,1.0000,"End-stage liver disease (ESLD) has become the main cause of mortality in patients coinfected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus in developed countries. The aim of this study was to describe the natural history of and prognostic factors for ESLD, with particular attention paid to features affecting liver transplantation. This was a prospective cohort study in 2 Spanish community-based hospitals performed between 1999 and 2004. One hundred four consecutive patients with cirrhosis and a first clinical decompensation of their chronic liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma were included in the study. During a median follow-up of 10 months (endpoint: death, liver transplantation, or the last checkup date), 61 patients (59%) died. The probability of mortality (Kaplan-Meier method) at 1, 2, and 3 years was 43% [95% confidence interval (CI), 34%-60%], 59% (95% CI, 48%-70%), and 70% (95% Cl, 59%-81%), respectively. In a multivariate analysis, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and the inability to reach an undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load at any time during follow-up were the only variables independently associated with the risk of death (P < 0.001). Fifteen (14%) of the 104 patients were accepted for liver transplantation, although only 5 underwent the procedure, and 10 died while on the waiting list. The waiting list mortality rate in patients with a MELD score < 20 and in patients with a MELD score >20 was 58% and 100%, respectively (median follow-up, 5 months). In conclusion, HIV-1-infected patients with ESLD, especially those with poorly controlled HIV and a high MELD score, have a poor short-term outcome. The MELD score may be useful in deciding whether to indicate liver transplantation in these patients. However, because only a small proportion of the patients in this study were considered candidates for liver transplantation and most died while on the waiting list, few received a transplant."
9831,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) improves growth and survival of HIV-infected individuals. We designed a retrospective cohort study to assess clinical factors associated with growth in HIV-infected children on ART in Uganda between July 2003 and March 2006. Height and weight measurements taken pre- and post-ART initiation for at least 6 months were age- and gender-standardized to CDC 2000 reference. We analyzed medical records of 749 children receiving ART. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify covariates associated with risk of either stunting or being underweight. Longitudinal regression analysis with a mixed model using autoregressive covariance structure was used to compare change in height and weight before and after initiation of ART. The mean age of the study population at first visit was 7.5 years. Mean height-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-height percentiles at first visit were 8.6, 7.7, and 7.9, respectively. At last visit mean height-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-height percentiles were 8.6, 13.3, and 13.8, respectively. Baseline weight-for-age z score of 1 or more was protective against stunting (odds ratio [OR] 0.25, confidence interval [CI] 0.18-0.35) while baseline height-for-age z score of 1 or more was protective against becoming underweight (OR 0.75, CI 0.63-0.88). Children in World Health Organization (WHO) stages II, III, and IV at baseline were 1.5 times more likely to become underweight (OR 1.51, CI 1.07-2.14). Initiation of ART resulted in improvement in mean standardized weight-for-age z score and weight-for-age percentiles (p < 0.001). Weight-for-age percentile and z score improved significantly after initiation of ART. This pediatric population gained weight more rapidly than height after initiation of ART."
18727,0.005,1.0000,"Among women with HIV infection, pregnancy is a time when maintenance of maternal health and reduction of vertical HIV transmission are primary concerns. Few studies have examined adherence to Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) during pregnancy and in the postpartum period when the demands of childcare may significantly interfere with women's self-care behaviors. This study examined ART use and adherence in HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women participating in the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS-IV) in the US. Adherence was assessed through a self-report interview during the third trimester of pregnancy and six-month postpartum. Data were also collected on demographics, biomedical markers and health related symptoms. During the third trimester visit, 77% (309/399) of women completed the self-report adherence measure; 61% (188/309) reported complete adherence. Factors associated with non-adherence included advanced HIV disease status, higher HIV-RNA viral load, more health-related symptoms and alcohol and tobacco use. At six-month postpartum, 55% (220/399) completed the measure; 44% (97/220) of these women reported complete adherence. Factors associated with non-adherence during the postpartum period were ethnicity, more health-related symptoms and WITS clinical site. Results of multivariate analyses using Generalized Estimated Equation analyses across the two visits revealed that more health-related symptoms, higher HIV-RNA viral load, increased alcohol use and clinical site were independently associated with ART non-adherence. These analyses indicate that medication adherence is more likely during pregnancy than postpartum in HIV-infected women, perhaps provoked by motivation to reduce vertical transmission and/or intensive antepartum surveillance. Further investigation is warranted to clarify factors implicated in women's decision-making process regarding ART medication adherence."

We performed a retrospective cohort study of US patients using the Truven Health Analytics databases from 2006 to 2010 and identified patients with noncirrhotic chronic HBV. Surveillance patterns were characterized using categorical and continuous outcomes, with the continuous measure of the proportion of time 'up to date' with surveillance (PUTDS), with the 6-month interval following each ultrasound categorized as 'up to date'. During a median follow-up of 26.0 (IQR: 16.2-40.0) months among 4576 noncirrhotic patients with chronic HBV (median age: 44 years, IQR: 36-52), only 306 (6.7%) had complete surveillance (one ultrasound every 6-month interval), 2727 (59.6%) incomplete (≥1 ultrasound) and 1543 (33.7%) none. The mean PUTDS was 0.34 ± 0.29, and the median was 0.32 (IQR: 0.03-0.52). In multinomial logistic regression models, patients diagnosed by a nongastroenterologist were significantly less likely to have complete surveillance (P < 0.001), as were those coinfected with HBV/HIV (P < 0.001). In linear regression models, nongastroenterologist provider, health insurance subtype, HBV/HIV coinfection, rural status and metabolic syndrome were independently associated with decreased surveillance. Patients with HIV had an absolute decrease in the PUTDS of 0.24, while patients in less populated rural areas had an absolute decrease of 0.10.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with elevated serum lipid levels, and HCV infection is associated with low serum lipid levels. Fasting lipid levels were investigated in 1,434 ART-naïve HIV-infected people participating in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Longitudinal Linked Randomized Trials (ALLRT) protocol who prospectively initiated ART with 3 agents. Subjects with elevated liver-associated enzymes (>5 x ULN) were excluded. Demographics, body mass index, HCV status, CD4 cell count, HIV RNA, liver enzymes, lipid levels, and glucose were assessed before and following 48 weeks of ART. HCV-positive subjects (n = 160; 11%) were older, more likely to be Black, have a history of intravenous drug use (IDU), have higher baseline liver-associated enzyme levels than the HCV-negative group (p < .001 for each), and to have diabetes at baseline (5% vs. 2%, p = .07). Lipid levels rose in both groups following ART, and the differences were not significant except that HDL levels increased significantly more in the HCV-positive group (p = .006). In summary, HCV infection did not appear to provide significant protection against ART-induced hyperlipidemia in this cohort of HIV-infected subjects prospectively enrolled in ART trials, although HDL levels rose to a greater degree."

MS was defined using modified National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. Cox proportional hazards for all-cause mortality were estimated for baseline MS status and for its individual defining criteria. There were 83 deaths with median follow-up of 63 months. Baseline characteristics associated with increased risk of mortality were: older age in years (univariate hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, p<0.01), current smoking (HR 1.99, p=0.02), current heroin use (HR 1.97, p=0.02), living in poverty (HR 2.0, p<0.01), higher mean HIV viral load (HR 1.81, p<0.01), and having a BMI <18 (HR 5.84, p<0.01).

The objective of this study was to explore the association between ART adherence and individual beliefs, perceived effectiveness of ART, and self-rated health in particular, in this specific population. The study used baseline survey data from a longitudinal intervention study of HIV prevention among PWID in Estonia, in which 107 HIV-infected participants reported current use of ART. Current adherence was measured through the use of a visual analog scale. Approximately half (49%) of the participants reported optimal (≥95%) adherence. The vast majority (81%) believed in the effectiveness of ART. Less than a quarter of the participants (22%) rated their health as good or very good, and a half (52%) reported average health. Individual beliefs and self-reported health were not associated with ART adherence in both bivariate and multivariable analyses. Participants with problem drinking reported significant suboptimal adherence to ART (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.19-0.97). Daily injection drug use was also associated with suboptimal adherence (AOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.91). Problem drinking has not been commonly reported as a factor of suboptimal ART adherence among PWID; further research would be useful to identify the pathways that might be involved."

Women were more likely to die if they were both hyponatremic (sodium <135 mmol/liter) and hypochloremic (chloride <95 mmol/liter) (37% vs. 6%) or hypoalbuminemic (albumin <34 g/liter, 13% vs. 4%) when initiating ART. A body mass index <18 kg/m(2) [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 5.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6-10.6] and hyponatremia with hypochloremia (aHR 4.5, 95% CI 2.2-9.4) were associated with 1-year mortality after adjusting for country, CD4 cell count, WHO clinical stage, hemoglobin, and albumin. Among women with a CD4 cell count >50 cells/μl, hypoalbuminemia was also a significant predictor of mortality (aHR=3.7, 95% CI 1.4-9.8). Baseline hyponatremia with hypochloremia and hypoalbuminemia predicted mortality in the first year of initiating ART, and these abnormalities might reflect opportunistic infections (e.g., tuberculosis) or advanced HIV disease. Assessment of serum sodium, chloride, and albumin can identify HIV-infected patients at highest risk for mortality who may benefit from more intensive medical management during the first year of ART."
4163,0.005,1.0000,"Noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis, measured at baseline, have been shown to predict liver-related mortality. It remains unknown if a change in the value of the scores over time predicts mortality in patients with HIV and viral hepatitis. In this retrospective study, survival in HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV; n = 67), HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV; n = 43), and HIV/HBV/HCV (n = 41) patients was examined using Kaplan-Meier life table analysis. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and FIB-4 scores, two noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis, were calculated at baseline and at last available clinical follow-up to determine the change in fibrosis score. Factors associated with mortality were assessed by Cox proportional hazards, including the change in the noninvasive marker score between the two time points. All-cause mortality was determined by Social Security Death Index and chart review. Sixty-seven were coinfected with HIV/HBV, 43 with HIV/HCV, and 41 were triply infected (HIV/HBV/HCV). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed similar survival for the three groups at 7 years of follow-up (p = 0.10). However, median length of follow-up was lower in HIV/HCV (60.5; range 0-102) compared to HIV/HBV (75.7; 12.3-126.5) and HIV/HBV/HCV (80.0; 2.7-123) months, respectively, p = 0.02. Baseline fibrosis score (p = 0.002), an increase in the value for noninvasive measurements for fibrosis (p < 0.001), and the presence of HIV/HCV coinfection (p = 0.041) were each associated with higher risk for mortality. Baseline fibrosis score (p = 0.03) and an increase in FIB-4 score (p = 0.05) were independent predictors of all-cause mortality, but liver-related mortality was not evaluated. In this study, baseline fibrosis score was predictive of 7-year all-cause mortality. Further studies are needed in a prospective cohort to evaluate the predictive value of monitoring changes in fibrosis scores over time to predict mortality in patients with viral hepatitis."
3231,0.005,1.0000,"Despite the success of combined antiretroviral therapy (ART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains a lifelong infection because of latent viral reservoirs in infected patients. The contribution of CD4(+) T cells to infection and disease progression has been extensively studied. However, during early HIV infection, macrophages in brain and other tissues are infected and contribute to tissue-specific diseases, such as encephalitis and dementia in brain and pneumonia in lung. The extent of infection of monocytes and macrophages has not been rigorously assessed with assays comparable to those used to study infection of CD4(+) T cells and to evaluate the number of CD4(+) T cells that harbor infectious viral genomes. To assess the contribution of productively infected monocytes and macrophages to HIV- and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected cells in vivo, we developed a quantitative virus outgrowth assay (QVOA) based on similar assays used to quantitate CD4(+) T cell latent reservoirs in HIV- and SIV-infected individuals in whom the infection is suppressed by ART. Myeloid cells expressing CD11b were serially diluted and cocultured with susceptible cells to amplify virus. T cell receptor β RNA was measured as a control to assess the potential contribution of CD4(+) T cells in the assay. Virus production in the supernatant was quantitated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Productively infected myeloid cells were detected in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lungs, spleen, and brain, demonstrating that these cells persist throughout SIV infection and have the potential to contribute to the viral reservoir during ART."
15343,0.005,1.0000,"In patients with chronic hepatitis C and HIV infection, responsiveness to the standard schedule of alpha-interferon (IFN) is unsatisfactory. To quantify the effectiveness of tailoring IFN dosage according to HCV viral load under treatment, we enrolled 41 patients (M/F 32/9) chronically coinfected by HCV and HIV with chronic liver disease. All were former i.v. drug addicts, with a mean age of 32+/-4 years, and had clinical and histological evidence of chronic hepatitis (10% with cirrhosis). The CDC stage was A1 in five, A2 in 14, A3 in eight, B2 in eight, B3 in three and C3 in three. Twenty four patients were on triple therapy with protease inhibitors, 11 were on two-drug anti-HIV regimens and three were untreated. IFN (alphan1 interferon) was started at 3 MU tiw and increased at 6 MU tiw at 4 weeks if serum HCV-RNA had not dropped by at least 50%. IFN was stopped at 24 weeks in non-responders. Eleven patients received a dose increase (total IFN dose at 24 weeks 396 MU), while 16 did not increase the initial dose (total IFN dose at 24 weeks 216 MU). Fourteen subjects stopped within the first weeks due to relapse of drug abuse (ten) or subjective intolerance (four). ALT and HCV-RNA levels were markedly decreased at week 4, and this reduction lasted up to 24 weeks. However only one patient had a complete biochemical and virological end-of-treatment response, which was maintained over a 24 weeks post-therapy follow-up. All other patients relapsed to baseline ALT and HCV-RNA values after stopping IFN. HIV viral load was slightly reduced under IFN therapy, while CD4 counts were unaffected. We conclude that raising the dose of IFN dose not eradicate HCV in most HIV-infected patients, even when HIV is well controlled by treatment. HCV viraemia and necroinflammation are temporarily suppressed by IFN, but the relevance of these surrogate endpoints to progression of liver disease and to survival cannot be assessed."
6214,0.005,1.0000,"There is an established association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and mixed cryoglobulinemia, as demonstrated in studies mostly conducted before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). To assess the impact of the latter on the cryoglobulinemic status in patients with HIV infection, 133 consecutive, unselected HIV-positive patients, from which only 8 (6%) had co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), were evaluated for the presence of cryoglobulins, according to whether they received or not antiretroviral therapy (ART). Patients shown to be cryoglobulin-positive in a previous study were assessed prospectively, after introducing HAART. Cryoglobulinemia was found in 10 (7.5%) of 133 patients:4 (3.9%) of 101 patients receiving ART versus 6 (18.8%) of 32 patients not receiving ART (P = 0.013). When HCV-positive patients were excluded from the analysis, the correlation between cryoglobulinemia and ART remained significant (P = 0.019). Among 11 previously detected cryoglobulin-positive patients, 8 became cryoglobulin-negative after receiving HAART for a mean period of 6.5 years (P = 0.039). Thus, ART seems to decrease the prevalence of cryoglobulinemia in HIV-infected, HCV-negative patients, a finding which provides indirect evidence of the etiologic role of HIV in the pathogenesis of cryoglobulins."
12567,0.005,1.0000,"Pyrazinamide is the main driver of sterilizing effect in the standard regimen in adults and older children, and this effect is concentration-dependent. Tuberculosis patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have an increased risk for poor tuberculosis treatment outcomes and adverse drug events. We sought to determine whether measures of systemic immune activation were related to pyrazinamide pharmacokinetics among HIV/tuberculosis patients. We conducted a prospective cohort study of pyrazinamide pharmacokinetics in HIV/tuberculosis patients in Gaborone, Botswana. Patients underwent intensive pharmacokinetic sampling before and after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, which can increase immune activation in HIV/tuberculosis. Compartmental pharmacokinetic modeling was performed to determine whether variability in systemic immune activation was related to variability in pyrazinamide pharmacokinetic parameters. Forty HIV/tuberculosis patients completed the first pharmacokinetic sampling visit, and 24 patients returned for a second visit following antiretroviral therapy initiation. The pyrazinamide plasma concentration-versus-time data were best explained by a one-compartment model with first-order elimination, and a combined additive and proportional residual error model. Pyrazinamide clearance was higher in men than women. Expression of CD38 and HLA- DR on CD8+T cells, a measure of HIV-associated immune activation, was inversely related to pyrazinamide clearance, with increasing immune activation associated with decreasing pyrazinamide clearance. Future studies should verify this finding in larger numbers of tuberculosis patients with and without HIV co-infection."
8789,0.005,1.0000,"The primary objective of this retrospective study was to determine how many patients in routine practice who were treated with combination antiretroviral treatment reached HIV-1 RNA levels below 50-400 copies/ml in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Seventy-four antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected patients from five different centres in Germany, Italy, Sweden and the USA were included. Thirty-nine percent of the patients had a HIV-1-associated neurological disease and 53% of the patients had AIDS. HIV-1 RNA in CSF and plasma were quantified before and after approximately 3 months of treatment. At baseline, the median value of HIV-1 RNA in CSF was 4.12 log copies/ml (interquartile range (IQR): 3.28-4.85) and it decreased to < 1.70 log copies/ml (IQR: < 1.70-2.48; P < 0.001) after in median 3 months of treatment. Seventy-six percent of the patients had HIV-1 RNA levels below the limits of detection in CSF at follow-up, and 85% reached below 400 copies/ml. In plasma, 45% of the patients had levels of HIV-1 RNA below the limits of detection at follow-up and 80% reached below 400 copies/ml. The group of patients with a neurological disease had a significantly higher CSF viral load both at baseline and at follow-up compared with the neurologically asymptomatic patients. We conclude that the central nervous system (CNS) is usually not a 'sanctuary site', difficult to reach with combination antiretroviral treatment."

Our objective was test the effectiveness of a community-based advanced practice nurse intervention to promote adherence to HIV and psychiatric treatment regimens call Preventing AIDS Through Health for Positives (PATH+). We enrolled 238 HIV-positive subjects with SMI who were in treatment at community HIV provider agencies from 2004 to 2009. Participants in the intervention group were assigned an advanced practice nurse who provided community-based care management at a minimum of one visit/week and coordinated their medical and mental healthcare for 12 months. A parallel process latent growth curve model using three data points for biomarkers (baseline, 12 and 24 months) and five data points for health related quality of life (baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months) showed moderate to excellent fit for modeling changes in CD4, viral load, and mental and physical SF-12 subscales. Results suggest that positive effects for PATH+ persisted at 24 months; 12 months after the intervention ended. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of a nurse-led, community-based, individually tailored adherence intervention. We demonstrated improved outcomes in individuals with HIV/SMI and regarding health-related quality of life and reductions in disease burden. "
16829,0.005,1.0000,"Ninety-nine sequential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 28 human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-infected patients were analyzed during the follow-up of 9 months to 4 years. Intrathecal synthesis of HIV-antibodies and IgG (p < 0.01), and the levels of beta-2-microglobulin (beta 2m) in the CSF (p < 0.05) and serum (p < 0.01) increased with duration of HIV-1 infection. No effect of duration of HIV-1 infection was observed on the individual CSF white cell counts and the levels of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability. In 13 patients with HIV-1-associated central nervous system (CNS) disease, the effect of duration was seen as an increase of the individual beta 2m levels in serum (p < 0.01). Moreover, 7 of 9 patients who developed neurological disease or showed its progression during the study increased the level of beta 2m in the CSF. All of them increased the level of beta 2m in serum. In 15 neurologically healthy subjects, the effect of duration was expressed as an increase of the level of individual beta 2m in CSF (p < 0.05) and intrathecal IgG synthesis (p < 0.01). In the AIDS group, the level of beta 2m in the CSF increased, but in less severe stages the dependency of the individual CSF parameters on disease duration was not found. Our results indicate that elevated levels of beta 2m in CSF and serum appear to predict progression of neurological and systemic diseases, respectively. Elevated beta 2m in the CSF of clinically intact individuals may indicate subclinical neurological disease caused by HIV-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
17933,0.005,1.0000,"Our objective was to describe the prevalence of low concentrations of retinol, beta-carotene, and vitamin E in a group of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected Latin American children and a comparison group of HIV-exposed, uninfected children. Our hypothesis was that the rates of low concentrations of these micronutrients would be higher in the HIV-infected group than those in the HIV-exposed, uninfected group. This was a cross-sectional substudy of a larger cohort study at clinical pediatric HIV centers in Latin America. Serum levels of micronutrients were measured in the first stored sample obtained after each child's first birthday by high-performance liquid chromatography. Low concentrations of retinol, beta-carotene, and vitamin E were defined as serum levels below 0.70, 0.35, and 18.0 micromol/L, respectively. The population for this analysis was 336 children (124 HIV-infected, 212 HIV-exposed, uninfected) aged 1 year or older to younger than 4 years. Rates of low concentrations were 74% for retinol, 27% for beta-carotene, and 89% for vitamin E. These rates were not affected by HIV status. Among the HIV-infected children, those treated with antiretrovirals were less likely to have retinol deficiency, but no other HIV-related factors correlated with micronutrient low serum levels. Low concentrations of retinol, beta-carotene, and vitamin E are very common in children exposed to HIV living in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, regardless of HIV-infection status."
18954,0.005,1.0000,"In February 1994, a clinical trial by the Pediatrics AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG 076) demonstrated, for the first time, that it was possible to reduce the risk of vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by nearly 70% by means of a triple therapeutic regimen: 1) oral zidovudine (ZDV) beginning anytime between the 14th and 34th week of gestation until the end of pregnancy; 2) intravenous ZDV during pregnancy, and 3) administration of oral ZDV to neonates during the first 6 weeks of life. Later, epidemiologic studies performed in the United States of America and France showed that this regimen drastically reduced perinatal transmission in clinical practice. Since then, important strides have been made, not only in terms of treatment (new drugs and highly effective therapeutic regimens) and diagnosis (tests that can measure the viral load), but also in terms of an increased understanding of the pathogenesis of perinatal transmission of HIV-1. This report contains: a) a review of special considerations to be kept in mind when administering antiretroviral agents to pregnant women; b) a current overview of the results of clinical and epidemiologic trials dealing with the prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV-1; c) a look at the use of tests for measuring HIV-1 RNA (viral load) during pregnancy; d) the most recent recommendations on the use of antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis and elective cesarean section for reducing perinatal viral transmission. These recommendations apply to the United States, and other countries may prefer to use different approaches."
4585,0.005,1.0000,"Hyperbilirubinaemia with or without jaundice is one of the side effects of atazanavir boosted with low-dose ritonavir (ATV/rit) related to the drug plasma levels, as a result of its metabolism by UGT1A1 - uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase. Genotyping for UGT1A1*28 before initiation of antiretroviral therapy containing atazanavir may aid in identifying individuals at risk of hyperbilirubinaemia. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of the UGTA1A1*28 polymorphism in HIV-infected individuals in Greece and to determine its potential association with hyperbilirubinaemia in patients receiving ATV/rit. The prevalence of the UGTA1A1*28 variant was estimated in 79 HIV-infected patients prior to the administration of the first-line treatment. The UGTA1A1*28 variant was detected in 46 out of 79 individuals (58.2%). Antiretroviral therapy was administered to 64/79 patients (81%). Among them, 26/64 (40.6%) received ATV/rit. Of the ATV/rit-treated patients, 14 were found to be carriers of the UGT1A1*28 variant (54%), and maximum serum bilirubin levels were significantly higher in the carrier population (4.71 vs. 2.69 mg/dL, p = 0.026). In 50% of the population, maximum levels were recorded in the first month of follow-up. Although carriage of UGT1A1 is linked with the development of hyperbilirubinaemia, the implementation of a pharmacogenomic approach in clinical practice cannot yet be recommended as a standard of care.

5226,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of antiretroviral therapy is to obtain an almost complete and durable suppression of viral replication in all compartments to facilitate recovery of the immune system. We assessed the virologic effect in plasma, tonsillar tissue, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 94 HIV-1-infected patients with CD4 counts >500 x 106 cells per liter and viral load >5000 copies/ml randomly assigned to triple antiretroviral therapy (two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus one protease inhibitor) versus double therapy (two NRTIs). We also analyzed the immunologic recovery in this cohort of patients. Lymphoid tissue and cerebrospinal fluid viral load, development of genotypic resistance, proliferative responses to HIV-1 specific antigens, and other immunophenotypic markers were analyzed. The proportion of patients who achieved a decrease in HIV RNA levels to <200 copies/ml was significantly greater in the triple therapy group than in the two drug groups (p =.0002 for each pair-wise difference). At week 52, tonsillar tissue HIV RNA from 5 patients treated with triple therapy was lower than the limit of detection, whereas the mean +/- standard error in patients with double therapy (n = 5) was 5.03 +/- 0.34 copies/mg/tissue. In all 10 patients, CSF viral load (VL) was <20 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml at week 52. CSF cell counts and protein levels tended to decrease after 52 weeks of antiretroviral therapy. After 1 year of therapy, 13 of 21 patients (62%) in the double-therapy groups (zidovudine plus lamivudine [n = 9] and stavudine plus lamivudine [n = 12]) had evidence of M184V mutation. None of the 10 samples of patients receiving triple therapy could be amplified because of low HIV RNA levels. The mean increase in CD4 cells at week 52 was greater in the stavudine and lamivudine and indinavir group than in the double-treatment arms (186 versus 67 and 102, respectively; p =.03). In patients treated with triple therapy, the increase in naive T cells (CD4 and CD8) was greater than in patients treated with double therapy. Markers of activation decreased further in patients treated with the regimen that included protease inhibitors. Proliferative responses to HIV-1 p24 antigen were never recovered after double or triple therapy. Our study suggests that even in very early stages of HIV-1 disease only therapy with two NRTIs and one protease inhibitor reduces plasma, lymphoid tissue, and CSF VL to undetectable levels. HIV-1-related immune system abnormalities improved but were still defective after 1 year of antiretroviral therapy."
16790,0.005,1.0000,"Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus type-1 (HTLV-1), the first human retrovirus associated with a malignant disease, is endemic in Jamaica. Vertical transmission and sexual intercourse are the major routes of transmission. Women are at greater risk of contracting the virus as it is more efficiently transmitted from male to female than in the reverse. Prevention of transmission is best achieved by health education on safe practices. The study aims to document the knowledge, attitude and behaviour pattern (KABP) of a group of women five years after they had participated in a mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-1 risk reduction study. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a 46-point structured interviewer-administered questionnaire to capture data from 88 mothers. Overall knowledge scores were computed and four rating categories created. There were large deficiencies in the knowledge and practice of women at risk of being infected with HTLV-1. Only 58% knew that HTLV-1 is sexually transmitted. A minority was aware of HTLV-1 associated diseases: Adult T-cell lymphoma/leukaemia (ATL) -30.7%; Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (TSP) -42%; Infective dermatitis -42%). Ten (11.4%) believed that HTLV-1 infection can cause HIV/AIDS and only 33% knew that there was no cure for the virus. Most women (88.6%) continued to have unprotected sex. Controlling HTLV-1 spread must be based on interrupting transmission. In Jamaica, donated blood is screened for HTLV-1 and sharing of infected needle is an insignificant mode of transmission. However although safe practices in breastfeeding and sexual intercourse are proven ways to reduce HTLV-1 transmission, these data show that knowledge and safe practices among those at risk may not be retained and health education will need to be sustained."
2320,0.005,1.0000,"Most antiretrovirals are metabolized in the liver, and overexposure could be more common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with hepatic impairment. Careful monitoring of potential drug-related liver injury in clinical practice is necessary. The aim of our study was to analyze the trough concentrations (C (trough)) of atazanavir (ATV) in the plasma of HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-co-infected patients and to compare the values with those of a HIV-infected control population. C (trough) values (22-26 h after last intake) of atazanavir, following the administration of atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg once daily as part of antiretroviral therapy, were assessed by HPLC. We also collected data on dosing of atazanavir, and on demographic (age, gender, and ethnicity), physiological (weight and body mass index), and clinical parameters (CD4+ cell count, HIV-RNA viremia, co-medication, and hepatitis C co-infection). A total of 28 Caucasian HIV-infected adults were studied, of whom 13 were HIV/HCV co-infected. No baseline characteristics differed between the two cohorts, except statistically significant differences regarding ALT, AST, and total bilirubin. The median (range) plasma ATV C (trough) levels were 0.62 (0.05-3.22) μg/ml in HIV patients and 0.32 (0.04-3.37) μg/ml in HIV/HCV patients. Thus, there was no significant difference in plasma trough levels of atazanavir in the two cohorts. In our patients with mild impairment of hepatic function caused by HCV infection, atazanavir C (trough) was comparable in HIV-infected and HIV/HCV-co-infected patients."

Molecular cloning of HIV-1 PCR products which might improve minority detection can be slow and difficult, and commercially available recombinant virus assays test drug susceptibility of virus pools. We describe novel plasmids and simple methods for rapid cloning of HIV-1 PCR products from patient specimens and their application to generate infectious recombinant virus clones for virus phenotyping and genotyping. Eight plasmids with differing deletions of sequences encoding HIV-1 protease, reverse transcriptase, or Gag p7/p1 and Gag p1/p6 cleavage sites were constructed for cloning HIV-1 PCR products. A simple HIV-1 sequence-specific uracil deglycosylase-mediated cloning method with the vectors and primers designed here was more rapid than standard ligase-mediated cloning. Pooled and molecularly cloned infectious recombinant viruses were generated with these vectors. Replicative viral fitness and drug susceptibility phenotypes of cloned infectious viruses containing patient specimen-derived sequences were measured. Clonal resistance genotyping analyses were also performed from virus isolates, plasma HIV-1 RNA, and infected cell DNA. Sequencing of a limited number of molecular clones detected minorities of resistant virus not identified in the pooled population PCR product sequence and linkage of minority mutations."
14741,0.005,1.0000,"Despite the Mozambique government's efforts to curb human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), national prevalence is 11.5% and support is needed to expand HIV-related services and improve program quality. Positive prevention (PP) programs, which prioritize HIV prevention with people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHIV), have been recognized as an important intervention for preventing new HIV infections. To address this, an evidence-based PP training intervention was implemented with HIV healthcare providers in Mozambique. This study focuses on the acceptability and feasibility of a PP intervention in HIV clinics from the healthcare provider perspective. In-depth interviews were conducted with 31 healthcare providers from three provinces who participated in PP trainings in Mozambique. Interview data were coded using content analysis. Study data suggest that healthcare providers found PP acceptable, feasible to implement in their HIV work in clinic settings, and valued this strategy to improve HIV prevention. The PP training also led providers to feel more comfortable counseling their patients about prevention, with a more holistic approach that included HIV testing, treatment and encouraging PLHIV to live positively. While overall acceptance of the PP training was positive, several barriers to feasibility surfaced in the data. Patient-level barriers included resistance to disclosing HIV status due to fear of stigma and discrimination, difficulty negotiating for condom use, difficulty engaging men in testing and treatment, and the effects of poverty on accessing care. Providers also identified work environment barriers including high patient load, time constraints, and frequent staff turnover. Recognizing PP as an important intervention, healthcare providers should be trained to provide comprehensive prevention, care and treatment for PLHIV. Further work is needed to explore the complex social dynamics and cultural challenges such as gender inequalities, stigma and discrimination which hinder the full impact of PP interventions in this context.

2416,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus-negative plasma-blastic lymphoma (PBL) is an extremely rare entity. Its clinicopathological features, optimal treatment strategy and prognostic factors remain obsure. An extensive search was performed in the English language literature within the Pubmed database using the key words: 'plasmablastic lymphoma and human immunodeficiency virus-negative or immunocompetent'. Data from 114 patients from 52 articles were analyzed. The mean patient age at diagnosis was 58.90 years (range, 2-86). HIV-negative PBL showed a predilection for elderly individuals (patients older than 60 years, 56.14%) and affected more males than females (M:F, 2.29:1). Ann Arbor stage IV patients accounted for 39.22% while bone marrow involvement was less frequent (12.79%). The Ki-67 index was high with a mean expression of 83%. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was common being positive in 58.70% of the patients while herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection was rare being positive in only 7.55% of the patients. Immunosuppression was noted in 28.16% of patients. The median overall survival (OS) was 19 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 52.3 and 45.3%, respectively. Age, gender and primary site showed no strong relationship with OS while Immunosuppression, Ann Arbor stage IV and EBV negativity were able to predict a poorer OS. Either complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) was superior to the refractory group in OS (P<0.0001 and P=0.0066, respectively). For stage Ⅰ patients, the application of radiotherapy did not improve the OS. In conclusion, HIV-negative PBL is a distinct entity likely occurring in elderly and immunosuppressed individuals. Immunosuppression status, Ann Arbor stage IV, EBV negativity and refractory to treatment are poor prognostic factors of OS in HIV-negative PBL. "
6749,0.005,1.0000,"Recent studies have shown that the accumulation of multiple mutations associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance may be grouped as multi-NRTI resistance (MNR) complexes. In this study, we have examined the viral fitness of recombinant viruses carrying the reverse transcriptase (RT) of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) primary isolate harboring mutations comprising the MNR 69 insertion complex. Different RT mutants were prepared in the sequence context of either the wild-type RT sequence of the HIV-1(BH10) isolate or the sequence found in a clinical HIV-1 isolate with the MNR 69 insertion mutation. As expected, in the presence of zidovudine, recombinant viruses harboring the MNR RT from the patient were more fit than wild-type viruses. However, in the absence of drug, the virus with the RT from the original clinical isolate (SS) was more fit than (i) the wild-type virus with an engineered serine insertion between residues 69 and 70 (T69SSS) and (ii) the recombinant virus with the MNR RT where the insertion was removed (2S0S). These results suggest that RT insertions, in the right sequence context (i.e., additional mutations contained in the MNR 69 insertion complex), enhance NRTI resistance and may improve viral fitness. Thus, comparing complex mutation patterns with viral fitness may help to elucidate the role of uncharacterized drug resistance mutations in antiretroviral treatment failure."

He was positive for antibodies to hepatitis B, C, and human immunodeficiency viruses, and had a history of chronic alcohol and iv drug abuse. The patient had 4 hospital admissions during a 12-wk period. He first presented with advanced liver disease including pedal edema and a serum ammonia level of 56 micromol/L (reference range: 11 - 35 micromol/L). In subsequent admissions, he had asterixis, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and worsening pedal edema.

During the first 3 hospitalizations, he was treated with lactulose with slight improvement. On the 4th admission, he was started on low-dose dopamine (3 microg/kg/min) and 25% salt-poor albumin without clinical improvement. A pulmonary artery catheter was placed and hemofiltration by CRRT was performed for 5 days, with removal of 26.7 L of fluid and a net reduction of 11 kg of body weight. Serum creatinine decreased to 4.2 mg/dl during CRRT and was 2.2 mg/dl at hospital discharge 2 weeks later. His PaO(2) improved from 66 to 78 mmHg and his systemic vascular resistance increased from 571 to 799 dyne.sec/cm(5). CRRT was effective in relieving severe fluid retention and producing marked clinical improvement. We suggest that CRRT should be considered for the treatment of refractory ascites including that caused by hepatorenal syndrome."
1866,0.005,1.0000,"Noncirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH) represents a relatively infrequent group of conditions that causes portal hypertension in the absence of cirrhosis. An association between NCPH and patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been reported. Six consecutive patients with HIV infection and NCPH were the subject of this series. Case histories, including medication lists, liver biopsy and laboratory data were reviewed. Age at diagnosis was 43 +/- 3 years (range, 37-47). Liver disease was diagnosed 12 +/- 4 years (range, 8-18) after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). All patients developed esophageal varices, 5 patients presented at least one bleeding episode and 2 required TIPS. Serum liver tests showed a mean total bilirubin of 1.4 +/- .7 mg/dL (range, .5-2.5) and INR was 1.2 +/- .14 (range, 1.0-1.4). CD4 count was 326 +/- 124 cells/mL (range, 198-467) and all patients presented HIV viral load < 75 copes/mL. Didanosine (ddl) was the most common ART drug being used by 4 patients. Portal vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 2 patients. Hepatic portal sclerosis (HPS) alone was observed in 1 patient, nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) alone in 2 patients and combined HPS/NRH in 3 patients. In conclusion, NCPH should be included in the differential diagnosis of HIV-individuals presenting with clinical manifestations of portal hypertension and well preserved liver synthetic function. Prolonged exposure to ART, specially ddl, can play a pathogenic role. Rarely, liver synthetic function is sufficiently severe to warrant liver transplantation."
5749,0.005,1.0000,"Naturally-occurring mutations associated with resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NA) can be detected in a group of treatment-naive individuals chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Genotypic resistance testing prior to the initiation of NA therapy may facilitate the selection of optimal drug regime and help to prevent early emergence of clinical resistance. In this study, presence of resistance mutations in treatment-naive individuals with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) was investigated in Hacettepe University Hospital, a referral center in Ankara province, Turkey. A total of 42 patients (17 female, 25 male; age range: 18-62 years) diagnosed as CHB were enrolled in the study with informed consent. All of the patients were negative for hepatitis C and D viruses and human immunodeficiency virus coinfections, and none had a history of interferon or NA treatment. HBV viral load, HBV markers and hepatic enzymes in patients were determined via standardized commercial assays. For the detection of NA resistance mutations, a partial sequence of approximately 250 nucleotides, harboring the frequently-observed sites for NA resistance was amplified via nested PCR and characterized by direct sequencing of the amplicons. The sequences were handled and interpreted for the presence of mutations via various softwares and a web-based virtual phenotyping tool. Well-characterized sequences were obtained in 30 out of 42 samples (71.4%). All circulating HBV strains were observed as genotype D. Nucleotide variations were detected in 19 individuals (63.5%) that comprise silent mutations without amino acid substitution in 8 (26.6%), mutations with undetermined significance in 7 (23.3%) and mutations associated with NA resistance in 3 (10%) patients. Mutations conferring resistance to entecavir + lamivudine (S202G, M204V, L180M, T184N) were identified in one patient whereas L180P, A181Q and A194V substitutions associated with probable lamivudin + adefovir and tenofovir resistance, respectively, were detected in other patients. All patients with resistance mutations were HBsAg and HBeAg positive, anti-HBe negative and had viral loads exceeding 3 x 10(7) IU/ml. In two patients, the route for HBV transmission was vertical. Since no follow-up samples were available from individuals with resistance mutations, alterations in serological markers, viral load and mutation patterns could not be monitored. In conclusion, the presence of NA resistance mutations were revealed in treatment-naive CHB cases in a referral hospital in Turkey. The impact and cost-effectivity of detecting naturally-occurring resistance mutations for clinical follow-up prior to the antiviral therapy need to be elucidated by prospective studies."
5317,0.005,1.0000,"In this paper the development of a self-management program to optimize long-term adherence to antiretroviral therapy for people living with HIV/AIDS is presented. The program is based on intervention mapping: that is, a framework that facilitates the use of theory and empirical evidence in intervention development. In the preparatory phase we conducted a needs-assessment. The results of this phase were then used in the operational phase in which the program was elaborated as follow: in Step 1 we established program objectives; in Step 2 we translated theoretical methods into practical strategies; and in Step 3 we integrated the strategies into a self-management program which were designed to help individuals mobilize their skills to cope with their antiretroviral therapies (ART). These particular abilities are: ability to integrate ART in daily routine, to cope with side effects, to handle situations in which ART is difficult to take, to interact with health professionals and to maintain relationships with social contacts. To address individuals' resources and skills in conjunction with the experience of taking the medication, we developed two different modalities to deliver the intervention: direct support and virtual support. Direct support consists of four 45-minute individualized, face-to-face sessions with a health professional. The Web application involved at least four interactive sessions with a computer. This application was developed with the intention to support individuals in managing their therapy, in a punctual, real-time mode. Treatment adherence behavior is an indicator or gauge that can reveal problems in being able to manage the therapy."
3439,0.005,1.0000,"The inadequate supply of transplantable organs necessitates new approaches to organ availability. Serologies and nucleic acid testing (NAT) for hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are used in microbiologic screening of potential organ donors. Organs from donors considered at ""high risk"" (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC 1994) or ""increased risk"" (U.S. Public Health Service, PHS 2013) for transmission of viral infection to recipients may provide an expanded source of organs for transplantation. We review a single-center experience with 257 adult organ recipients of organs from donors meeting either CDC 1994 or PHS 2013 risk criteria between 2011 and 2016. Tracking these transplants required modification of the Transplant Center electronic database to identify all recipients of increased-risk donor (IRD) organs, documentation of informed consent, and microbiologic testing data. No transmissions of HIV, HBV, or HCV were identified by NAT or clinically. Nine patients developed positive serologic assays for one of the tested viruses; all recipients were retested and remain negative by NAT. Notably, post-transplant HBV core serologies reverted to negative on re-testing; these positive serologies are likely false positives caused by receipt of blood products. Use of IRD organs can be performed safely with appropriate informed consent and rigorous pre- and post-transplant microbiological testing."
11337,0.005,1.0000,"Viral load measurements provide an indication of viral replication, and thereby serve as a valuable tool to guide the initiation of therapy and subsequent changes. Plasma human immunodeficiency viral load strongly predicts the rate of decrease in CD4+ lymphocyte count, and progression to AIDS and death. Furthermore, the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy can be assessed by monitoring changes in plasma human immunodeficiency viral load. Similarly, viral load provides valuable information about the natural history of the hepatitis C virus infection. Hepatitis C viral load can be used to predict the likelihood of response to standard interferon-alpha treatment and other interferon-alpha regimens and to monitor treatment efficacy. Increased understanding of the natural history of the hepatitis C virus infection and the nature of resistance to interferon-alpha therapy suggests that effective treatment regimens must maintain serum levels of interferon-alpha. Ideally, interferon-alpha serum levels should provide constant pressure on the virus and should prevent viral rebound, thereby avoiding continued viral replication and minimizing the potential for emergence of resistant quasi-species. Current regimens designed to address these points include early aggressive intervention, combination drug regimens, prolonged maintenance, and novel interferons. By enabling the design and rapid assessment of new treatment regimens, viral load measurement will revolutionize the clinical management of the hepatitis C virus infection, as it has the HIV."
15388,0.005,1.0000,"With the development of effective therapies against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with both infections (coinfection). In addition to the high prevalence of chronic HCV, particularly among HIV-infected injection drug users, the rate of incident HIV infections is increasing among HIV-infected men who have sex with men, leading to recommendations for education and screening for HCV in this population. Liver disease is the second leading and, in some cases, a preventable cause of death among coinfected patients. Those at risk for liver disease progression are usually treated with a combination of interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), which is not highly effective; it has low rates of sustained virologic response (SVR), especially for coinfected patients with HCV genotype 1 and those of African descent. Direct-acting antivirals might overcome factors such as immunodeficiency that can reduce the efficacy of IFN. However, for now it remains challenging to treat coinfected patients due to interactions among drugs, additive drug toxicities, and the continued need for combination therapies that include pegylated IFN. Recently developed HCV protease inhibitors such as telaprevir and boceprevir, given in combination with pegylated IFN and RBV, could increase the rate of SVR with manageable toxicity and drug interactions. We review the latest developments and obstacles to treating coinfected patients."
14523,0.005,1.0000,"Evidence is accumulating that CD4(+) T-helper (Th) responses play a critical role in facilitating effector responses which are capable of controlling and even preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The present work was undertaken to determine whether immunization with multiple antigens influenced individual Th responses and increased protection relative to a single antigen. Rhesus macaques were primed with DNA and boosted (immune-stimulating complex-formulated protein) with a combination of regulatory and structural antigens (Tat-Env-Gag) or with Tat alone. Immunization with combined antigens reduced the magnitude of the responses to Tat compared to the single-antigen immunization. Interestingly, the Th immune responses to the individual antigens were noticeably different. To determine whether the qualitative differences in vaccine-induced Th responses correlated with vaccine efficacy, animals were challenged intravenously with simian/human immunodeficiency virus (strain SHIV(89.6p)) 2 months following the final immunization. Animals that developed combined Th1- and Th2-like responses to Gag and Th2 dominant Env-specific responses were protected from disease progression. Interestingly, one animal that was completely protected from infection had the strongest IFN-gamma and interleukin-2 (IL-2) responses prior to challenge, in addition to very strong IL-4 responses to Gag and Env. In contrast, animals with only a marked vaccine-induced Tat-specific Th2 response (no IFN-gamma) were not protected from infection or disease. These data support the rationale that effective HIV vaccine-induced immunity requires a combination of potent Th1- and Th2-like responses best directed to multiple antigens."
17145,0.005,1.0000,"Tuberculosis (TB) has, for centuries, continued to remain a public health problem of enormous importance, particularly in the developing world, taking a heavy toll of those at their prime of life. The emergence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV infection) and its close association with TB poses an even greater challenge to the health systems in general and TB programmes in particular, in African and Asian countries. HIV is considered to be the most potent risk factor for progression to active TB among those infected both with TB and HIV; as a result, TB is the most common life threatening opportunistic infection associated with HIV, and biggest cause of death among patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In areas hard-hit by HIV, TB is increasing, leading to greater case load, thereby overstretching the already fragile health infrastructure. The deadly relationship between HIV and TB, each potentiating the effect of the other, requires a clearly defined strategy taking into consideration the natural history of the co-infection and its progression to clinical TB (and AIDS). It is clear that the only way to fight this is by bringing the two programmes to join forces and work creatively and innovatively. The strategy should include not only preventing HIV through community-based behavioural interventions and limiting progression to clinical TB through the use of isoniazid preventive therapy, but also early diagnosis and treatment of HIV-associated TB and AIDS using DOTS strategy and combination antiretroviral therapy respectively. The strategy probably would not succeed unless both the programmes are first strengthened before attempting to forge collaboration based on mutual strengths and comparative advantages. In addition, mobilizing national and international response, building partnerships and mobilizing resources will help a great deal in mounting an appropriate and effective response to HIV/TB in the Asian context."
5577,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is associated with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. This is the first study of the efficacy of long-term lamivudine therapy for patients with HBV infection after OLT. Eight patients (5 men, 3 women) aged 35 to 63 years (mean, 50 years) with HBV infection after OLT (6 patients, recurrent infection; 2 patients, de novo infection) were treated with lamivudine, 100 mg/d, on a compassionate-use basis. Before treatment, all had detectable HBV DNA in serum, and 5 patients (62.5%) had detectable serum hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg). Duration of treatment was 24 to 50 months (mean, 36 months). Patients were monitored for serum alanine aminotransferase level (ALT), HBV DNA (by hybridization), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and HBeAg before and after therapy, and liver histological findings were scored for inflammation and fibrosis. After treatment, 3 patients (32.5%) had undetectable HBV DNA by hybridization assay. None of the patients lost serum HBeAg and HBsAg, except for 1 patient who lost serum HBeAg and became serum antibody to HBeAg-positive. Serum ALT levels normalized in 5 patients (62.5%). Blinded histological assessment showed improvement in 1 patient, no change in 2 patients, and worsening in 5 patients. YMDD variants of HBV were detected in 5 patients (62.5%) within 9 to 20 months (mean, 13 months) of lamivudine therapy. Of these, 2 patients (40%) had hepatic failure (1 patient died of massive variceal bleed) and 3 patients remain clinically stable. Lamivudine therapy was continued in the latter patients. Although lamivudine is a potentially effective therapy for HBV infection after OLT, emergence of high mutation rates with long-term therapy, histological progression, and the possibility of hepatic failure point to the need to investigative combinations of antiviral therapy."
16702,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B is the main risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Asia. The most important preventive strategy's adoption of the universal hepatitis B vaccination program is now in its third decade. There is a clear reduction in both chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (hepatitis B surface antigen ""carriage"") but also in childhood HCC in Taiwan. An outstanding concern is variability in vaccine coverage between countries. For patients with chronic hepatitis B, serum HBV DNA levels have emerged as the key risk factor for development of HCC. The initial treatment for chronic hepatitis B was interferon. One randomized control trial, and several case-control or cohort studies have shown benefits for preventing HCC, particularly in cirrhotic patients who responded to therapy. With nucleos(t)ide analogs, the most important study has been the Asian Cirrhosis Lamivudine multicenter randomized controlled trial. This showed that lamivudine can reduce disease progression in HBV-related cirrhosis, including an approximately 50% decrease in HCC incidence. Such efficacy was achieved despite emergence of drug resistance in approximately 50% of cases. Case-control studies have suggested that hepatitis B cases without cirrhosis may also benefit. In conclusion, it is now possible to prevent HBV-related HCC. The most effective method is hepatitis B vaccination, which prevents chronic HBV infection and chronic liver disease resulting therefrom. Interferon therapy appears to confer benefit but the evidence is weaker. First-generation oral antiviral (lamivudine) reduces HCC risk, particularly in cirrhotics. Long-term outcome data with newer, more potent HBV antivirals that have a higher genetic barrier to drug resistance are eagerly awaited."
4987,0.005,1.0000,"Twenty-one immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1)-positive hemophilic patients were treated with Azidothymidine (AZT) for symptomatic HIV infection. The median observation period was 20.5 months. At 25 months the probability of survival was 82%, the probability of progression of disease from CDC III or IV C2 to IV C1 (AIDS) was 20% in patients on continuous AZT treatment and 50% in patients with interruption of treatment. Three patients developed severe leukopenia and 3 patients severe anemia during AZT treatment. In 1 patient a dose-dependent striking increase of transaminases during AZT treatment was observed. In 7 patients treatment was interrupted, in 1 patient because of anemia, in 1 because of pruritus and in 5 patients because of non-compliance. No significant changes in the consumption of clotting factor concentrates and number of bleeding episodes before and during AZT treatment were noted. We conclude, that both hematological and non-hematological side effects of AZT in HIV 1-infected hemophilic patients are comparable to those seen in other risk groups. AZT does not increase the bleeding tendency in this patient group."

To determine the status of HIV infection in a Mississippi adolescent population, we evaluated seroprevalence rates for adolescents attending Mississippi State Department of Health STD clinics from 1988 to 1990. During this 2-year period, 9855 adolescents (aged 13 to 20 years) attended STD clinics, and HIV antibody was confirmed in 39 (seroprevalence rate 4.0/1000; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.7 to 5.2). Seropositive rates were almost equal for male and female subjects (4.1/1000 and 3.8/1000, respectively), suggesting predominantly heterosexual transmission. Rates among blacks were 3.5 times higher than among whites. Adolescents with HIV infection were identified throughout the state, irrespective of urban centers. Rates among the smallest counties (ie, population less than 25,000) were not significantly different from those of the largest counties (ie, population greater than 100,000). Mississippi's rank in the top 10 states for other STDs and the state's high teenage pregnancy rate make it an epicenter of the HIV epidemic among adolescents."
15244,0.005,1.0000,"Concern has been expressed that tenofovir-containing regimens may have reduced effectiveness in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C infections because of a propensity for these viruses to develop a key tenofovir-associated resistance mutation. We evaluated whether subtype influenced rates of virological failure in a cohort of 8746 patients from the United Kingdom who received a standard tenofovir-containing first-line regimen and were followed for a median of 3.3 years. In unadjusted analyses, the rate of failure was approximately 2-fold higher among patients infected with subtype C virus as compared to those with subtype B virus (hazard ratio [HR], 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-2.31; P < .001). However, the increased risk was greatly attenuated in analyses adjusting for demographic and clinical factors (adjusted HR, 1.14; 95% CI, .83-1.58; P = .41). There were no differences between subtypes C and subtypes non-B and non-C in either univariate or multivariate analysis. These observations imply there is no intrinsic effect of viral subtype on the efficacy of tenofovir-containing regimens."
1300,0.005,1.0000,"As human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients now live longer while receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), chronic kidney disease (CKD) has emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among urban HIV population. Risk factors associated with CKD in such HIV-infected population include aging, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, co-infection with hepatitis C virus, low CD4 cell count, and high HIV viral load. Clinical experience has shown that HIV-infected individuals often have one or more concurrent risk factors for CKD. The cumulative effect of multiple risk factors on the development of CKD should be noted in this population. Glomerular disease directly related to HIV infection, so-called HIV-associated nephropathy, remains an important cause of CKD among limited HIV population of African descent. The impact of exposure to nephrotoxic antiretroviral agents on the development of kidney disease is both an old and a new concern. In particular, the association of tenofovir with kidney disease has been an area of great interest. The findings regarding tenofovir's adverse effect on long-term kidney function vary among studies. Early identification and treatment of kidney disease is imperative for reducing the burden of patients requiring dialysis in HIV-infected populations. Periodic monitoring of urinary albumin excretion, tubular parameters such as low-molecular-weight proteinuria, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate may be useful for early diagnosis of patients at risk for incident CKD. This review focuses on recent developments in epidemiology, risk factors, identification, estimation, and management of CKD in HIV-infected population in the HAART era."
7775,0.005,1.0000,"In the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), the ultimate goal is preventing hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently published studies show that in CHB patients treated with the currently recommended first-line nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) entecavir or tenofovir, annual HCC incidences range from 0.01% to 1.4% in non-cirrhotic patients, and from 0.9% to 5.4% in those with cirrhosis. In Asian studies including matched untreated controls, current NA therapy consistently resulted in a significantly lower HCC incidence in patients with cirrhosis, amounting to an overall HCC risk reduction of ∼30%; in non-cirrhotic patients, HCC risk reduction was overall ∼80%, but this was only observed in some studies. For patients of Caucasian origin, no appropriate comparative studies are available to date to evaluate the impact of NA treatment on HCC. Achievement of a virologic response under current NA therapy was associated with a lower HCC risk in Asian, but not Caucasian studies. Studies comparing entecavir or tenofovir with older NAs generally found no difference in HCC risk reduction between agents, except for one study which used no rescue therapy in patients developing lamivudine resistance. Overall, these data indicate that with the current, potent NAs, HCC risk can be reduced but not eliminated, probably due to risk factors that are not amenable to change by antiviral therapy, or events that may have taken place before treatment initiation. Validated pre- and on-therapy HCC risk calculators that inform the best practice for HCC surveillance and facilitate patient counseling would be of great practical value. "
10896,0.005,1.0000,"To determine the frequency and risk factors for female to male sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a prospective study was carried out in 422 men who had acquired a sexually transmitted disease (STD) from a group of prostitutes with a prevalence of HIV-1 infection of 85%. The initial seroprevalence of HIV among the men was 12%. 24 of 293 (8.2%) initially seronegative men seroconverted to HIV-1. Newly acquired infection was independently associated with frequent prostitute contact (risk ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2-8.1), with the acquisition of genital ulcer disease (risk ratio 4.7, 95% confidence interval 1.3-17.0), and with being uncircumcised (risk ratio 8.2, 95% confidence interval 3.0-23.0). 96% of documented seroconversions occurred in men with one or both of the latter two risk factors. In a subgroup of 73 seronegative men who reported a single prostitute sexual contact, the frequency of HIV-1 infection was 8.2% during 12 weeks of observation. No man without a genital ulcer seroconverted. A cumulative 43% of uncircumcised men who acquired an ulcer seroconverted to HIV-1 after a single sexual exposure. These data indicate an extremely high rate of female to male transmission of HIV-1 in the presence of STD and confirm a causal relation between lack of male circumcision, genital ulcer disease, and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection."
10991,0.005,1.0000,"Since the early 1990s, the number of women diagnosed with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has exploded. Heterosexual women have become one of the fastest-growing populations of newly diagnosed cases. However, the full impact of HIV infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) on women's health and the optimal management of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases have yet to be delineated. The urgency to establish effective management protocols is underscored by the fact that AIDS has recently become the leading cause of death for minority women in many urban areas. The administration of antepartum and intrapartum zidovudine (azidothymidine, AZT) has advanced efforts to minimize perinatal transmission and produced promising results. However, important issues pertaining to prevention of HIV infection in women, mandatory testing of women of reproductive age, and the management of HIV-positive women during the interconceptional period remain controversial. Addressing HIV throughout the continuum of reproductive health is a major priority and a concern of all health care providers. Women's health care must assume the lead in counseling all women about their risk of HIV, ensuring that HIV-positive women make informed decisions about their reproductive health and that HIV-negative women modify high-risk behavior to avoid becoming infected. Since obstetricians and gynecologists, nurse practitioners, and midwives are often the first care providers whom at-risk and HIV-infected women contact, they must be able to identify, assess, and optimally manage these patients. This article reviews the epidemiology, virology, pathology, preconceptional counseling/testing, and management of women with HIV infection in pregnancy, thereby providing the practitioner with information and tools to enhance women's health."

Two men were lost to follow-up. The mean follow-up time was 62 months. By the end of the follow-up period 26 out of 78 subjects (33%) were diagnosed with AIDS. When controlling for age, year of HIV diagnosis, number of male lifetime partners and frequency of receptive anal intercourse, the adjusted relative risk of being diagnosed with AIDS for the group smoking 1-20 cigarettes daily was 0.4 (0.2-1.2, 95% confidence interval) and 1.1 (0.4-2.7, 95% confidence interval) for the group smoking more than 20 cigarettes daily, as opposed to the non-smoking group. The adjusted relative risk of progression to AIDS for daily alcohol drinkers as opposed to less frequent drinkers was 0.8 (0.3-2.2, 95% confidence interval). The adjusted relative risks of receptive anal intercourse often or usually and more than 500 lifetime male partners were 2.2 and 2.0, respectively. These estimates, however, were not significantly above 1.0. The lack of positive association between cigarette smoking, drinking of alcohol and progression to AIDS found in this study as well as in other studies, may have implication for the understanding of the pathogenesis of the HIV disease and for counselling HIV infected subjects."
