5727,0.03333333333333333,20.0000,"During recent years significant progress has been made in the treatment of HIV-1, at least in part due to the availability of potent antiretroviral drugs. The goal of the current treatment strategies is to inhibit the viral replication as completely as possible by using a combination of 3 or more antiretroviral drugs. This Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) has radically changed the clinical outcome of HIV, leading to decreased mortality and morbidity, at least in developed countries. Additionally to the advent of new and potent drugs, demonstrations of the prognostic value of the CD4 cell count and the plasma viral load were of major importance in the development of therapeutic strategies. Especially the ability of viral load assays to assess accurately the true level of viral replication, led to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. HIV proved to be a highly dynamic infection even during the period of clinical latency. The initial enthusiasm that HAART could radically change the outcome of HIV was cooled off in face of the difficulties in real life associated with the complex treatment strategies. Besides long-term side effects and suboptimal drug potency, the emergence of resistant virus and the necessity of perfect therapy adherence are major concerns for obtaining a sustained control of viral replication. In this study we focused on HIV resistance, which remains one of the major threats for a sustained response to antiretroviral therapy. HIV proved to be able to develop resistance to all currently used antiretroviral drugs. The high replication rate of the virus together with the low fidelity of the viral reverse transcriptase, from the basis for the presence of enormous amounts of viral variants. Whenever viral replication is ongoing in the presence of antiretroviral drugs, these variants that escape the inhibitory effects of the drugs will be selected. Although the knowledge in the field of HIV resistance has expanded enormously, many issues need to be answered. Genotypic and phenotypic resistance patterns are evolving continuously, due to changes in the treatment strategies. Moreover the relation between drug resistance and therapy failure needs further investigation, in order to prove the relevance of performing resistance testing in the follow-up of HIV-infected patients. The wide availability of antiretroviral drugs has led to the transmission of resistant HIV. Infection with HIV resistant to one or more antiretroviral drugs has been observed to occur through the different transmission routes. In a first study we assessed the prevalence of genotypic resistance to antiretroviral drugs in Belgian antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients. We observed that HIV strains with resistance-related mutations to one or more classes of antiretroviral drugs are not uncommon in the Belgian naïve patients. Furthermore the inclusion of samples from patients visiting the Belgian hospitals for the first time in 1995, 1997 and 1998, showed that the overall prevalence of baseline genotypic resistance remains rather constant (26-30%). The increasing trend in genotypic baseline resistance to 3TC (2% to 6.3%) and PIs (4.4% to 9.9%) as well as the decrease in ZDV-resistance (13.3% to 5.4%), reflect the change in treatment strategies, and resistance to these drugs is most probably caused by transmission of variants with resistance mutations selected during therapy. The presence of NNRTI-related mutations (around 16%) is likely to reflect the occurrence of baseline polymorphisms, since NNRTI-related mutations can occur without a replication deficit for the virus. Moreover, despite the rather recent introduction of NNRTIs into the clinic from 1997 onwards, no clear trend in NNRTI baseline resistance over time is observed. The best current therapeutic strategy for HIV-infected patients is to start antiretroviral therapy with HAART in order to avoid the accumulation of resistance towards drugs in less suppressive regimens. In a second study, we showed that the start of HAART in antiretroviral-naive HIV-patients in daily clinical practice could prevent viral breakthrough for up to 44 months in 60% of patients (n = 25). Six of 10 patients with virologic failure developed resistance to the drugs included in their treatment regimens. In comparison to patients with a sustained virologic response, patients with virologic failure were in a later disease stage when starting therapy and showed lower PI drug-levels, what can be an indication of poor adherence. Despite a poor virologic response for some of them, a rise in CD4 cell count was observed for all patients during the study period. A large number of HIV-infected patients started treatment in the pre-HAART period. The use of NRTIs is mono- or bitherapy was not able to prevent the development of resistant virus. In a third study we studied the prevalence and characteristics of 2 patterns of multinucleoside resistance (MNR) in European patients (n = 755). In patients without NRTI-exposure or with exposure to only one NRTI, no MNR was observed. MNR was present in low prevalence (each pattern < 2%) in patients pretreated with multiple NRTIs. Despite this low prevalence, MNR should be closely monitored, since it results in broad cross-resistance to NRTIs in vitro and a poor therapy response in vivo. We also assessed the predictive value of baseline resistance on the virologic response to later added drugs. The genotype of patients starting or changing a therapy consisting solely of NRTIs was analyzed at baseline and 6 months later. In patients without genotypic mutations towards the added drug the virologic response was significantly better compared to patients with baseline resistance. At 6 months however, both patient groups showed a rise in viral load due to the accumulation of NRTI-related mutations under the presence of poorly suppressive regimens, although the difference between the two groups remained significant. In this study, and also in studies reported by others, the presence of baseline resistance has a high predictive value for therapy failure, while the absence of resistance is not predictive for therapy response. Suboptimal adherence may be one of the reasons of the poor predictive value of the absence of baseline resistance for a good therapy response. In a last observational study, we investigated the relation between adherence, the presence and development of genotypic resistance and the virologic response in patients during HAART therapy. Adherence to 1 protease inhibitor was monitored using Electronic Event Monitoring. Patients with perfect therapy adherence and in particular without drug holidays, can control viral replication provided that the activity of the drugs included in the combination is not entirely compromised by the presence of baseline resistance mutations. In our patient population, reduced adherence resulted in therapy failure, mostly associated with a subsequent accumulation of resistance mutations. In conclusion, the outcome of the HIV disease has been revolutionarily changed with the advent of HAART. Both resistance and treatment adherence are crucial factors in determining the therapy response. Retrospective studies, such as ours, and a limited number of prospective trials already proved the short-term benefit of therapy switch based on the results of resistance tests in addition to standard of care. To ultimately define the role of tools as resistance testing and adherence monitoring with eventual adherence interventions, more prospective trials are needed as well in treatment-naïve as in experienced patients."
10635,0.021666666666666667,13.0000,"The work on this thesis began in 2003 when the global HIV epidemic was out of control. A minority of persons with HIV were benefitting fully from the recently introduced highly efficacious antiretroviral therapy (ART) combinations. Among the global challenges were lack of access to good healthcare, drug toxicity, and emergence of drug-resistant virus. It was unknown how long the drugs could maintain their efficacy in the individual even if administered as intended, and there was a fear that the increased drug pressure would increase the prevalence of drug resistance, subsequently leading to transmission of resistant virus from one individual to another, and thereby waning the treatment options available. Hence, we were far from the ideal conditions where an HIV-infected individual gets to know immediately that he/she is infected, has access to specialized medical and social support, receives a drug combination which effectively suppresses the virus and has no side effects, and is free of co-morbid conditions both before and after he/she gets infected. The nine papers on which this thesis is based each aimed to provide new knowledge to aspects of the above. Late diagnosis and late presentation to clinical care continue to be major barriers to improved HIV management. We used nation-wide hospital registries to explore the potential for an indicator disease-based HIV testing strategy. A range of conditions that were manifestations of the HIV infection itself were found to be associated with highly increased risk of HIV diagnosis during the coming year, but less so three to five years later. Other conditions were associated with an almost constant five-year long increased risk of being diagnosed with HIV because they share behavioural risk factors with HIV, making them indicators of not only current HIV but also of future HIV acquisition. Hence, indicator condition-based testing should be adapted to the local epidemic and could be a valuable addition to the existing detection practice. Once diagnosed, getting the full benefit of modern HIV care requires access to a good healthcare system. We compared temporal trends in quality and quantity of ART introduction in Den-mark and Greenland. Despite similar levels of health worker education and economic resources, ART implementation and mortality decline in Greenland lacked several years behind Denmark. The study reminded us that although economy may be a prerequisite for implementing an effective HIV care system, it is certainly not all it takes. The nationwide nature of the Danish HIV Cohort Study also allowed us to study a number of time trends at the population level. Despite what was feared, we found that the prevalence of triple-drug class virological failure (TCF) seemed to have stabilized after 2000; that the incidence rates of drug resistance acquisition were decreasing during 1999-2005; and that the prevalence of potential transmitters of drug-resistant HIV decreased during 1997-2004. We also looked at some of the consequences of virological failure and drug resistance and found that even modest levels of viraemia were associated with a high risk of future failure and death, and that in persons who have experienced TCF, the number and pattern of resistance mutations were independent predictors of death. Hence, despite the overall positive trends in virological failure and drug-resistance development at the population level, our findings underline the crucial importance of always having an effective treatment option available for the individual patient with drug-resistant virus. As mortality was declining for persons with access to ART and good HIV care, it became important to know how long persons with HIV could expect to live compared to the general population. We projected long-term survival and found that a 25-year old person with HIV and without hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection had a 50 per cent chance of surviving another 39 years, only 12.2 years less than a person in a matched general population cohort would survive. With improved survival and declining HIV-related co-morbidity, non-HIV related co-morbidity became a more visible contributor to the health status of persons with HIV. We assessed the impact of non-HIV related comorbidity acquired before the person became infected with HIV. We found that 32% of the observed mortality in our cohort was due to HCV and co-morbidities measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index, 13% corresponded to the background mortality in the population, and that only 55% of the mortality could be attributed to HIV. Our findings confirmed that persons acquiring HIV differ at large from the general population, and that we should not expect overall mortality rates in populations with HIV to reach the levels in the general population. This thesis attempted to map some of the many challenges on the road towards increased survival of individuals and populations with HIV up to a level, which today in many settings is close to that of the general population. The studies in this thesis have each paid their modest contribution to show how crucially important it is to be diagnosed in time, to have access to a well-functioning health system, and to keep free of co-morbidity both before and after acquiring HIV. After many years of struggle and despair, and thanks to enormous advances in prevention and treatment, we are now looking towards a promising future. "
4669,0.016666666666666666,10.0000,"Depression is a common comorbidity among HIV-infected individuals. We studied the relationship between depressive symptoms, risk behaviors (risky-sexual behavior, tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use) and HIV outcomes. This cross-sectional study conducted in 2009 at the Washington University HIV Clinic included screening for depression with patient health questionnaire, survey of sexual behavior, illicit drug, alcohol, and tobacco use within 30 days. Sociodemographics, plasma HIV RNA levels, CD4 cell counts, and sexually transmitted disease test results were obtained from medical records. Multivariate logistic and linear regression models were used to assess the association between depressive symptoms severity and risk behaviors, HIV outcomes and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) adherence. A total of 624 persons completed the assessment of whom 432 (69%) were male and 426 (68%) African-American. The median CD4 cell count was 410 cells/mm(3) and 479 persons (77%) were on cART of whom 112 (23%) had HIV RNA level > 400 copies/mL. Overall, 96 (15%) had symptoms of major depressive disorder. Depressive symptom severity was associated with increased likelihood of high-risk drinking (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-5.1), current tobacco use (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.9), illicit drug use (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-2.8), and risky-sexual behavior (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.8-2.7). Suboptimal cART adherence (visual analog scale < 95%) was also associated with depressive symptoms severity (p < 0.05). After adjustment for age, sex, race, receipt of cART, and cART adherence, depressive symptoms severity was independently associated with lower CD4 cell count (p < 0.05) but not with higher HIV RNA level (p = 0.39). Depression adversely affects HIV-infected individuals, requiring greater effort at utilizing multidisciplinary interventions."
1797,0.015,9.0000,"The primary objective of this study was to gain a clearer understanding of the barriers to adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) faced by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHIV/AIDS) on Long Island, New York. Focus group, a qualitative research method, was used to study these barriers. The study was conducted in 1998 on Long Island, NY, at five institutions that provide services to 1700 PLWHIV/AIDS. Five focus groups were conducted with 6 to 13 PLWHIV/AIDS in each group, a total of 39 subjects. PLWHIV/AIDS identified eight common barriers to adherence to HAART. In descending order, the barriers include: (1) frequency and severity of side effects, (2) conflicts with daily routines, (3) dietary requirements, (4) frequency of taking medications, (5) number and dosage of medications, (6) psychosocial factors (i.e., stress, feeling good, and bad news), (7) pharmacy refills, and (8) physiological needs (i.e., sleep, hunger, or thirst). Many factors play a role in the success or failure of HAART, including preexisting drug resistance, drug-drug interactions, and the ability of PLWHIV/AIDS to adhere to a rigid and frequently changing medication regimen. The information gleaned from focus groups is limited in that it may not be generalized to a larger population with any known reliability. However, clinicians sensitive to barriers to adherence to HAART, including those identified by PLWHIV/AIDS in this study, may play a more proactive role in supporting adherence to the medication regimen, increasing the durability of effective viral suppression, decreasing morbidity and mortality, and decreasing the selection and transmission of resistant strains of HIV."
11097,0.015,9.0000,"The advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 1996 resulted in fewer patients experiencing clinical events, so that some prognostic analyses of individual cohort studies of human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals had low statistical power. Because of this, the Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration (ART-CC) of HIV cohort studies in Europe and North America was established in 2000, with the aim of studying the prognosis for clinical events in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the mortality of adult patients treated for HIV-1 infection. In 2002, the ART-CC collected data on more than 12,000 patients in 13 cohorts who had begun combination ART between 1995 and 2001. Subsequent updates took place in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010. The ART-CC data base now includes data on more than 70,000 patients participating in 19 cohorts who began treatment before the end of 2009. Data are collected on patient demographics (e.g. sex, age, assumed transmission group, race/ethnicity, geographical origin), HIV biomarkers (e.g. CD4 cell count, plasma viral load of HIV-1), ART regimen, dates and types of AIDS events, and dates and causes of death. In recent years, additional data on co-infections such as hepatitis C; risk factors such as smoking, alcohol and drug use; non-HIV biomarkers such as haemoglobin and liver enzymes; and adherence to ART have been collected whenever available. The data remain the property of the contributing cohorts, whose representatives manage the ART-CC via the steering committee of the Collaboration. External collaboration is welcomed. Details of contacts are given on the ART-CC website (www.art-cohort-collaboration.org)."
10422,0.015,9.0000,"The declining incidence of AIDS-related opportunistic diseases among people with HIV infection has shifted the focus of clinical management to prevention and treatment of comorbidities such as chronic liver disease. The increased risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related advanced liver disease in people with HIV infection makes early HCV diagnosis a priority. To assess HCV prevalence and predictors of HIV/HCV coinfection, we have conducted a retrospective analysis of people enrolled in the CAESAR (Canada, Australia, Europe, South Africa) study, a multinational randomized placebo-controlled study of the addition of lamivudine to background antiretroviral therapy. The impact of HCV on HIV disease progression was also examined. Anti-HCV antibody testing on 1649 CAESAR study participants demonstrated a HIV/HCV coinfection prevalence of 16.1%, which varied from 1.9% in South Africa to 48.6% in Italy. The strongest predictor of HIV/HCV coinfection was HIV exposure category (P<0.0001), with odds ratios (ORs) compared to homosexual as follows: injecting drug use (IDU), 365 [95% confidence interval (CI): 179-742]; transfusion or blood products, 32.2 (95% CI: 15.2-67.6); homosexual and IDU, 22.9 (95% CI: 8.5-62.1). The prevalence of HIV/HCV was low (3.7%) among homosexual men without reported IDU. Other predictors of HIV/HCV coinfection were alanine aminotransferase (ALT), country of residence, ethnicity and stage of HIV disease. A history of IDU or ALT > or =40 U/L at baseline had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 35%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 96%, sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 71% for HIV/HCV coinfection. HIV disease progression was similar in HIV monoinfected and HIV/HCV coinfected patients. People with HIV and a history of IDU or elevated liver function tests should be targeted for HCV testing. The low prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection among homosexual men without a history of IDU suggests low efficiency of sexual HCV transmission."
7112,0.015,9.0000,"Although a considerable number of studies have been undertaken to date, it is still controversial as to whether or not coinfection with schistosomiasis increases the susceptibility to or progression from Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This review is a closer examination of the key studies conducted on human populations on clinical factors that were published in English between 1975 and January 2015. Our review is mainly based on tables containing the salient information, which are arranged first by study population, country of study and publication date. We provide further explanation, clarification and discussion in the text. As such, it includes both studies that have been conducted on general populations who are largely asymptomatic for clinical disease (Table 3), as well as those focussing on special populations, which are usually comprised of clinical patients. These special populations have been presented as follows: subjects with chronic liver disease or related conditions such as cirrhosis, Table 4; subjects with primary liver cancer, Table 5; subjects with schistosomiasis, Table 6; subjects with acute or chronic hepatitis resulting from HBV, Table 7 and, subjects with HCV, Table 8. We have presented studies that compared two mono-infected groups with one that is coinfected separately in Table 9, as these offer us the best basis from which to evaluate if any synergistic effects accompany coinfection. A number of factors contributed to the results reported in our tables. These included, but are not limited to: subject selection (i.e. asymptomatic cases typically drawn from the general population vs subjects presenting to a hospital or clinic with clinical disease); study design, which directly impacts our ability to infer causality (i.e. case series, cross-sectional, case-control, cohort study); use and choice of control population (i.e. apparently healthy subjects vs other hospital patients vs none); sample size, which directly impacts statistical power and can result in a Type II error; geographic area, which may reflect differences in population genetics, public health history, environmental differences or any number of other important factors (i.e. Egypt, Brazil, China); method of testing for schistosomal infections (i.e. stool vs antibody test); method of testing to determine if advanced schistosomal disease was present (i.e. ultrasound, liver biopsy vs none); method of serological testing for HBV (i.e. use of HBsAg alone or with other markers or DNA testing); method of serological testing for HCV (i.e. use of anti-HCV alone or with RNA testing) and, year of the study, which reflects among other things, technological improvements between tests as well as possible changes in the frequency of exposure in the populations under study (i.e. use of parenteral antischistosomal therapy vs the oral antischistosomal medication). Despite all these differences, throughout this review we have observed general patterns that seem largely consistent with one another. Studies conducted on general, largely asymptomatic populations tend to support the view that having one of the diseases in question (i.e. schistosomiasis) does not necessarily predispose one to becoming coinfected with another (i.e. HBV or HCV). Rather, the probability of becoming coinfected seems most closely associated with modes of transmission for either HBV or HCV in schistosome-endemic areas, such as the past use of parenteral antischistosomal therapy or frequent blood transfusion. Once coinfected, however, the clinical course of illness for those with Schistosoma-HBV or Schistosoma-HCV infections are typically much more severe than for mono-infected subjects. The strongest evidence for this was found in the half-dozen or so prospective cohort studies that systematically monitored disease progression in their subjects. With respect to HBV infection, coinfection with Schistosoma prolonged the carriage state and more often resulted in chronic hepatitis with greater cirrhosis as well as higher mortality. Much of the same was also observed with respect to HCV, where coinfection with Schistosoma was associated with a reduced ability to spontaneously resolve the viral infection and more often resulted in rapid fibrosis as well as higher mortality. Furthermore, two of these studies which were fully comparative in nature, support the supposition that there is a synergistic association between Schistosoma-HCV for both liver fibrosis and mortality. Immunological studies, all conducted on HCV, also generally seem to support this. The results of our research argue for greater primary prevention for both HBV and HCV in Schistosoma-endemic populations. Although no vaccine currently exists for HCV as it does for HBV, additional steps can still be taken to reduce transmission in high-risk populations. Greater use of the HBV vaccine is particularly advisable. Finally, additional observational, longitudinal studies conducted on human populations that are fully comparative in nature could help answer some of the remaining questions on both Schistosoma-HBV as well as Schistosoma-HCV coinfections. Some of these include the role of active versus past schistosomal infections, the role of genetic variants, as well as the effect of coinfection on treatment. Future studies should make a particular effort to use a sufficient sample size to ensure adequate statistical power, which was not often properly considered in many of the studies we reviewed for this paper.

10059,0.013333333333333334,8.0000,"Most ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral regimens offer comparable levels of virological efficacy. Thus, the tolerability of the regimen becomes a distinguishing factor with implications for patient quality of life (QoL), treatment adherence, and clinical outcome. This article describes results from the CASTLE study (comparing once-daily atazanavir/ritonavir [ATV/RTV] with twice-daily lopinavir/ritonavir [LPV/RTV], both in combination with fixed-dose tenofovir/emtricitabine, in treatment-naive HIV-infected patients) and an evaluation of the impact of gastrointestinal (GI) complications of treatment on patient QoL, as measured by the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) QoL questionnaire (IBS-QoL). Changes in IBS-QoL from baseline over time (to week 24) were classified as: ""Improvement"" (> or =2-point positive change from baseline), ""No change"" (<2-point change), or ""Worsening"" (> or =2-point negative change). Data were collected on GI adverse events (AEs) and use of GI medications. Of the 599 patients with IBS-QoL-evaluable data through week 24, fewer patients in the ATV/RTV group than in the LPV/RTV group experienced grade 2-4 treatment-related GI AEs including diarrhea (3% versus 10%), nausea (5% versus 7%), and vomiting (<1% on both arms). Nearly three times as many patients receiving LPV/RTV used GI medications. ATV/RTV was associated with an increase in overall IBS-QoL scores and more patients receiving ATV/RTV than LPV/RTV experienced improvement in IBS-QoL through week 24. In contrast to LPV/RTV, ATV/RTV treatment was associated with earlier and more positive improvements in QoL scores across CD4 sub-groups. Differences in the health-related QoL profile between ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV may be important when selecting PI-based antiretroviral regimens."
15298,0.013333333333333334,8.0000,"It is known that transmitted drug resistance (TDR) will most likely emerge in regions where antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been widely available for years. However, after a decade of rapid scale-up of ART in China, there are few data regarding TDR among HIV-infected patients prior to initiating first-line ART in China. A prospective, observational cohort study was performed at sentinel sites in five provinces or municipalities. Study participants were recruited at the county- or city-level centers for disease control (CDCs), during routine monitoring visits following referral from diagnosing parties (e.g., hospitals). Each province or municipality recruited 140 patients through sequential sampling throughout the 2011 calendar year. A total of 627 eligible subjects were included in the analysis. the median CD4(+) cell count was 206 cells/ml at the baseline survey. The majority of patients (93.5%) had plasma HIV viral load ≥1,000 copies/ml. Of the 627 patients, 17 (2.7%) had drug resistance mutations for any type of HIV drugs. The prevalence of drug resistance mutations to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) drugs (8/627, 1.3%) was higher than to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) drugs (5/627, 0.8%) and protease inhibitor (PI) drugs (4/627, 0.6%). A logistic regression model showed that the only predictive factor was the route of infection through homosexual intercourse, i.e., men who have sex with men (MSM) status. As HIV prevalence is rising rapidly among Chinese MSM, it is essential to continue surveying this risk group and related high-risk populations with low awareness of HIV, and to develop new public health interventions that help to reduce the spread of drug-resistant HIV."
640,0.011666666666666667,7.0000,"Although China's government is rapidly expanding access to antiretroviral therapy, little is known about barriers to adherence among Chinese HIV-infected patients, particularly among injection drug users. To better understand barriers to antiretroviral treatment adherence, we conducted a qualitative research study, using both focus group and key informant methods, among 36 HIV-positive men and women in Dali, in southwestern China. All interviews utilized semi-structured question guides and were conducted in Mandarin, audio-recorded and translated into English for analysis. The most commonly cited adherence challenges were stigma, including secondary stigma experienced by family members; mental health issues; and economic concerns, particularly related to finding and maintaining employment. Distinctive gender differences emerged, partly due to previous heroin use among male respondents. Optimizing adherence may require that antiretroviral therapy programs be linked to other services, including drug addiction treatment, mental health services and vocational treatment and support. HIV care and service providers and policy makers in China responsible for HIV treatment should be aware of these important barriers to adherence."
4738,0.011666666666666667,7.0000,"Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may lead to chronic HCV-infection with detectable HCV RNA or to spontaneous clearance with no HCV RNA, but detectable HCV antibodies. It is unknown whether HCV RNA status is associated with mortality in HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs). We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study to examine the impact of HCV RNA status on overall and cause-specific mortality in HIV-infected IDUs. We computed cumulative mortality and used Cox Regression to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRR). We identified 392 HIV-infected patients of whom 284 (72%) had chronic HCV-infection (HCV RNA positive patients) and 108 (28%) had cleared the HCV-infection (HCV RNA negative patients). During 1286 person-years of observation (PYR), 157 persons died (MR = 122/1000 PYR, 95% CI: 104-143). The estimated 5-year probabilities of survival were 0.58 (95% CI: 0.51-0.65) in the chronically HCV-infected and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.40-0.63) in the cleared HCV group. Chronic HCV-infection was not associated with overall mortality: MRR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.59-1.21. In HIV-infected Danish IDUs, chronic HCV-infection is not associated with increased mortality compared to patients who have cleared the infection."
14248,0.011666666666666667,7.0000,"Although weight loss associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is multifactorial in its pathogenesis, it has been speculated that hypogonadism, a common occurrence in HIV disease, contributes to depletion of lean tissue and muscle dysfunction. We, therefore, examined the effects of testosterone replacement by means of Androderm, a permeation-enhanced, nongenital transdermal system, on lean body mass, body weight, muscle strength, health-related quality of life, and HIV-disease markers. We randomly assigned 41 HIV-infected, ambulatory men, 18-60 yr of age, with serum testosterone levels below 400 ng/dL, to 1 of 2 treatment groups: group I, two placebo patches (n = 21); or group II, two testosterone patches designed to release 5 mg testosterone over 24 h. Eighteen men in the placebo group and 14 men in the testosterone group completed the 12-week treatment. Serum total and free testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels increased, and LH and FSH levels decreased in the testosterone-treated, but not in the placebo-treated, men. Lean body mass and fat-free mass, measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, increased significantly in men receiving testosterone patches [change in lean body mass, +1.345 +/- 0.533 kg (P = 0.02 compared to no change); change in fat-free mass, +1.364 +/- 0.525 kg (P = 0.02 compared to no change)], but did not change in the placebo group [change in lean body mass, 0.189 +/- 0.470 kg (P = NS compared to no change); change in fat-free mass, 0.186 +/- 0.470 kg (P = NS compared to no change)]. However, there was no significant difference between the 2 treatment groups in the change in lean body mass. The change in lean body mass during treatment was moderately correlated with the increment in serum testosterone levels (r = 0.41; P = 0.02). The testosterone-treated men experienced a greater decrease in fat mass than those receiving placebo patches (P = 0.04). There was no significant change in body weight in either treatment group. Changes in overall quality of life scores did not correlate with testosterone treatment; however, in the subcategory of role limitation due to emotional problems, the men in the testosterone group improved an average of 43 points of a 0-100 possible score, whereas those in the placebo group did not change. Red cell count increased in the testosterone group (change in red cell count, +0.1 +/- 0.1 10(12)/L) but decreased in the placebo group (change in red cell count, -0.2 +/- 0.1 10(12)/L). CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts and plasma HIV copy number did not significantly change during treatment. Serum prostate-specific antigen and plasma lipid levels did not change in either treatment group. Testosterone replacement in HIV-infected men with low testosterone levels is safe and is associated with a 1.35-kg gain in lean body mass, a significantly greater reduction in fat mass than that achieved with placebo treatment, an increased red cell count, and an improvement in role limitation due to emotional problems. Further studies are needed to assess whether testosterone supplementation can produce clinically meaningful changes in muscle function and disease outcome in HIV-infected men."
16463,0.01,6.0000,"Injecting drug use is commonly reported among gay and bisexual men in Australia. We examined the prevalence and covariates of injecting drug use among men participating in the Sydney Gay Community Periodic Survey between 2004-06 and 2011. In 2004-06, data was collected about which drugs were injected, while in 2011, data was collected about hepatitis C (HCV) and esoteric sexual practices. In 2004-06, 5.6 % of men reported injecting drugs in the previous 6 months; 3.4 % reported methamphetamine injection and 0.4 % heroin injection. In 2011, men who injected drugs were less likely to be employed full-time, and more likely to be HCV-positive, HIV-positive, to have used party drugs for sex, and to have engaged in esoteric sexual practices. The strong associations between injecting drug use, sexual risk practices and blood-borne virus infection suggests the need for combined sexual health and harm reduction services for gay and bisexual men who inject drugs."
2874,0.01,6.0000,"Data on the effects of sustained virologic response (SVR) to hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy on the outcome of extrahepatic complications are scarce. We conducted this study to assess the impact of SVR on the occurrence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. We analyzed coinfected HIV/HCV patients in the Management of Standardized Evaluation of Retroviral HIV Infection (MASTER) cohort. Only event-free patients with a serum HCV-RNA determination at baseline were included. Patients were divided into four groups: INF-exposed with SVR; INF-exposed without SVR; spontaneous HCV clearance; untreated viremic patients. We estimated the incidence of extrahepatic complications and employed Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression to assess the association of SVR/INF strata adjusted for a series of confounders. Data from 1676 patients were analyzed (20.29 % started an INF-based regimen). Overall, the incidence of CKD, DM, CVD, and death was 5.32 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3.99-6.98], 10.13 (95 % CI 8.20-12.37), 6.79 (95 % CI 5.26-8.65), and 13.49 (95 % CI 11.29-16.0) per 1000 person-years of follow-up, respectively. In the Cox model for treated patients, SVR was not associated with a lower risk of CKD, DM, CVD, and death compared to non-SVR. Cirrhosis was significantly associated with a higher risk of CKD [hazard ratio (HR) 2.13; 95 % CI 1.06-4.31], DM (HR 3.48; 95 % CI 2.18-5.57), and death (HR 6.18; 95 % CI 4.1-9.31), but not of CVD (HR 1.14; 95 % CI 0.57-2.3). There are still many unknowns regarding the impact of SVR on the occurrence of extrahepatic complications in coinfected HIV/HCV patients. Further investigations are needed in order to elucidate the role of SVR as an independent prognostic factor for extrahepatic events. "
13002,0.01,6.0000,"Population-based estimates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence and risk behaviors among men who have sex with men (MSM) are valuable for HIV prevention planning but not widely available, especially at the local level. We combined two population-based data sources to estimate prevalence of diagnosed HIV infection, HIV-associated risk-behaviors, and HIV testing patterns among sexually active MSM in New York City (NYC). HIV/AIDS surveillance data were used to determine the number of living males reporting a history of sex with men who had been diagnosed in NYC with HIV infection through 2002 (23% of HIV-infected males did not have HIV transmission risk information available). Sexual behavior data from a cross-sectional telephone survey were used to estimate the number of sexually active MSM in NYC in 2002. Prevalence of diagnosed HIV infection was estimated using the ratio of HIV-infected MSM to sexually active MSM. The estimated base prevalence of diagnosed HIV infection was 8.4% overall (95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.5-9.6). Diagnosed HIV prevalence was highest among MSM who were non-Hispanic black (12.6%, 95% CI = 9.8-17.6), aged 35-44 (12.6%, 95% CI = 10.4-15.9), or 45-54 years (13.1%, 95% CI = 10.2-18.3), and residents of Manhattan (17.7%, 95% CI = 14.5-22.8). Overall, 37% (95% CI = 32-43%) of MSM reported using a condom at last sex, and 34% (95% CI = 28-39%) reported being tested for HIV in the past year. Estimates derived through sensitivity analyses (assigning a range of HIV-infected males with no reported risk information as MSM) yielded higher diagnosed HIV prevalence estimates (11.0-13.2%). Accounting for additional undiagnosed HIV-infected MSM yielded even higher prevalence estimates. The high prevalence of diagnosed HIV among sexually active MSM in NYC is likely due to a combination of high incidence over the course of the epidemic and prolonged survival in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Despite high HIV prevalence in this population, condom use and HIV testing are low. Combining complementary population-based data sources can provide critical HIV-related information to guide prevention efforts. Individual counseling and education interventions should focus on increasing condom use and encouraging safer sex practices among all sexually active MSM, particularly those groups with low levels of condom use and multiple sex partners."
1399,0.01,6.0000,"Fat redistribution in the setting of protease inhibitor use is increasingly common and is associated with insulin resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. However, little is known regarding the factors that may contribute to abnormal insulin regulation in this population. We assessed fasting insulin levels in HIV-infected men and determined the relationship among insulin, body composition, endogenous gonadal steroid concentrations, and antiviral therapy in this population. We also determined the effects of exogenous testosterone administration using the homeostatic model for insulin resistance (HOMA IR) in hypogonadal HIV-infected men with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome wasting syndrome. Fifty HIV-infected men with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome wasting were compared with 20 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy control subjects. Insulin concentrations were significantly increased in HIV-infected patients compared to those in control patients (16.6+/-1.8 vs. 10.4+/-0.8 microU/mL; P<0.05) and were increased in nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NRTI)-treated patients who did not receive a protease inhibitor (PI; 21.7+/-4.3 vs. 10.4+/-0.8 microU/mL; P<0.05). Insulin concentrations and HOMA IR were inversely correlated with the serum free testosterone concentration (r = -0.36; P = 0.01 for insulin level; r = -0.30; P = 0.03 for HOMA), but not to body composition parameters, age, or BMI. In a multivariate regression analysis, free testosterone (P = 0.05), BMI (P<0.01), and lean body mass (P = 0.04) were significant. Lower lean body mass and higher BMI predicted increased insulin resistance. The HIV-infected patients demonstrated an increased trunk fat to total fat ratio (0.49+/-0.02 vs. 0.45+/-0.02; P<0.05) and an increased trunk fat to extremity fat ratio (1.27+/-0.09 vs. 0.95+/-0.06, P = 0.01), but a reduced extremity fat to total fat ratio (0.44+/-0.01 vs. 0.49 + 0.01; P = 0.02) and reduced overall total body fat (13.8+/-0.7 vs. 17.2+/-0.9 kg; P<0.01) compared to the control subjects. Increased truncal fat and reduced extremity fat were seen among NRTI-treated patients, but this pattern was most severe among patients receiving combined NRTI and PI therapy [trunk fat to extremity ratio, 1.47+/-0.15 vs. 0.95+/-0.06 (P<0.01); extremity fat to total fat ratio, 0.40+/-0.02 vs. 0.49+/-0.01 (P<0.05)]. Insulin responses to testosterone administration were investigated among 52 HIV-infected men with hypogonadism and wasting (weight <90% ideal body weight and/or weight loss >10%) randomized to either testosterone (300 mg, im, every 3 weeks) or placebo for 6 months. Testosterone administration reduced HOMA IR in the HIV-infected men (-0.6+/-0.7 vs. +1.41+/-0.8, testosterone vs. placebo, P = 0.05) in association with increased lean body mass (P = 0.02). These data demonstrate significant hyperinsulinemia in HIV-infected patients, which can occur in the absence of PI use. In NRTI-treated patients not receiving PI, a precursor phenotype is apparent, with increased truncal fat, reduced extremity fat, and increased insulin concentrations. This phenotype is exaggerated in patients receiving PI therapy, with further increased truncal fat and reduced extremity fat, although hyperinsulinemia per se is not worse. Endogenous gonadal steroid levels are inversely related to hyperinsulinemia in HIV-infected men, but reduced lean body mass and increased weight are the primary independent predictors of hyperinsulinemia. Indexes of insulin sensitivity improve in response to physiological androgen administration among hypogonadal HIV-infected patients, and this change is again related primarily to increased lean body mass in response to testosterone administration."
12804,0.01,6.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is highly prevalent among chronic dialysis patients (10% to 40%) and is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. However, there are no studies estimating the risk for death among dialysis patients infected with HCV compared with those not infected. We conducted a prospective cohort study to estimate the risk for death among chronic dialysis patients infected with HCV compared with those not infected. In 1992, 200 patients (91%) who had been undergoing dialysis therapy for at least 6 months consented to be screened for HCV infection by enzyme immunoblot assay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Information about potential confounders and potential risk factors for death and HCV infection was obtained from the dialysis center database. Patient outcomes collected included death, transplantation, and loss to follow-up. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the odds of death among dialysis patients who were positive for the HCV antibody and HCV RNA compared with negative patients. Forty-four patients (22%) were HCV antibody positive. Thirty-four patients (17%) were HCV RNA positive. Patients in the HCV RNA-positive group were more likely to be younger (51.8+/-12.6 v 57.2+/-17.3 years of age), men (77% v 54%), and black (65% v 37%). None of the home hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis patients were HCV RNA positive, whereas one of the home hemodialysis and one of the peritoneal dialysis patients were HCV antibody positive. Two patients became infected with HCV during the follow-up period. Patients who were HCV RNA positive and those who were HCV antibody positive were at increased risk for death compared with patients who were negative (adjusted relative risk [aRR]=1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 3.14; P=0.045; and aRR=1.97; 95% CI, 1.16 to 3.33; P=0.012, respectively), after adjusting for time on dialysis, race, transplantation, and age. We conclude that HCV infection increased the risk for death during the study period compared with those not infected. Further studies should assess the measures used to prevent and treat HCV infection."
734,0.01,6.0000,"The availability of an increasing number of antiretroviral agents and the rapid evolution of new information has introduced substantial complexity into treatment regimens for persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation convened the Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV to develop guidelines for clinical management of HIV-infected adults and adolescents (CDC. Report of the NIH Panel To Define Principles of Therapy of HIV Infection and Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected adults and adolescents. MMWR 1998;47[RR-5]:1-41). This report, which updates the 1998 guidelines, addresses 1) using testing for plasma HIV ribonucleic acid levels (i.e., viral load) and CD4+ T cell count; 2) using testing for antiretroviral drug resistance; 3) considerations for when to initiate therapy; 4) adherence to antiretroviral therapy; 5) considerations for therapy among patients with advanced disease; 6) therapy-related adverse events; 7) interruption of therapy; 8) considerations for changing therapy and available therapeutic options; 9) treatment for acute HIV infection; 10) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among adolescents; 11) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among pregnant women; and 12) concerns related to transmission of HIV to others. Antiretroviral regimens are complex, have serious side effects, pose difficulty with adherence, and carry serious potential consequences from the development of viral resistance because of nonadherence to the drug regimen or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents. Patient education and involvement in therapeutic decisions is critical. Treatment should usually be offered to all patients with symptoms ascribed to HIV infection. Recommendations for offering antiretroviral therapy among asymptomatic patients require analysis of real and potential risks and benefits. Treatment should be offered to persons who have <350 CD4+ T cells/mm3 or plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels of >55,000 copies/mL (by b-deoxyribonucleic acid [bDNA] or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] assays). The recommendation to treat asymptomatic patients should be based on the willingness and readiness of the person to begin therapy; the degree of existing immunodeficiency as determined by the CD4+ T cell count; the risk for disease progression as determined by the CD4+ T cell count and level of plasma HIV RNA; the potential benefits and risks of initiating therapy in an asymptomatic person; and the likelihood, after counseling and education, of adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. Treatment goals should be maximal and durable suppression of viral load, restoration and preservation of immunologic function, improvement of quality of life, and reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Results of therapy are evaluated through plasma HIV RNA levels, which are expected to indicate a 1.0 log10 decrease at 2-8 weeks and no detectable virus (<50 copies/mL) at 4-6 months after treatment initiation. Failure of therapy at 4-6 months might be ascribed to nonadherence, inadequate potency of drugs or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents, viral resistance, and other factors that are poorly understood. Patients whose therapy fails in spite of a high level of adherence to the regimen should have their regimen changed; this change should be guided by a thorough drug treatment history and the results of drug-resistance testing. Because of limitations in the available alternative antiretroviral regimens that have documented efficacy, optimal changes in therapy might be difficult to achieve for patients in whom the preferred regimen has failed. These decisions are further confounded by problems with adherence, toxicity, and resistance. For certain patients, participating in a clinical trial with or without access to new drugs or using a regimen that might not achieve complete suppression of viral replication might be preferable. Because concepts regarding HIV management are evolving rapidly, readers should check regularly for additional information and updates at the HIV/AIDS Treatment Information Service website (http://www.hivatis.org)."
6834,0.01,6.0000,"Methadone maintenance patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) currently receiving antiretroviral therapy had HIV RNA testing and were surveyed regarding their adherence to their treatment regimens. Adherence was measured using self-report on four questions relating to medication use in the last day and last month and whether the patient took ""drug holidays."" Of the patients (N = 42), 52% were receiving two-drug antiretroviral therapy and 48% were receiving triple therapy that included a protease inhibitor. Persons on triple therapy reported higher rates of adherence on all measures and were more likely to have undetectable HIV RNA levels than persons on dual therapy (60% vs. 50%). Ongoing illicit drug injection was the only factor significantly associated (p < .05) with multiple measure nonadherence; however, it was not associated with undetectable HIV RNA level. Levels of nonadherence were comparable to estimates from other chronic diseases, but this finding has important implications for patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy."
13899,0.01,6.0000,"An increasing trend in sexual risk behavior has occurred in the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Thailand. This study was conducted to identify sexual risk behavior and examine relationships between unprotected sex and CD4 levels among HIV-infected patients receiving ART in the National Antiretroviral Program. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 460 HIV-infected patients age 18-49 years who visited the out-patient clinic of Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute in February 2006 by using a standardized self-administered questionnaire. The results show that 60.4% of participants were men. The median most recent CD4 cell count during the prior 6 months was 261 cells/mm3. Twenty-three percent of the participants who had no sexual activity after they knew their HIV positive status started having sex again after receiving ART with a 12-week median duration period from starting ART to having first sex. There was a significant difference between the number of those having sexual activity before and after starting ART (p-value=0.013). Fifty-six percent of participants had sex during the previous 6 months. Of these, 26.5% had sex with commercial partners and 28.4% with non-regular partners. Inconsistent condom use, with commercial partners or non-regular partners, in females (35.3-36.8%) was higher than in males (7.8-11.1%). Participants with a known HIV-negative regular partner were 0.25 times more likely to have unprotected sex than those with a known HIV-positive regular partner (adjusted OR, 0.25; 95%CI, 0.09-0.73). No association between unprotected sex and CD4 levels was found. The findings support the need for reinforcing risk reduction programs among HIV-infected persons, particularly couple counseling, and promoting awareness of risk of acquirring sexually transmitted infections and drug-resistant strains of HIV."
13084,0.008333333333333333,5.0000,"Both hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (HBV and HCV) infection are common in HIV-infected individuals as a result of shared risk factors for acquisition. A serological study for HBV and HCV was performed in 251 HIV-positive individuals from Medellín, Colombia. A qualitative RT-PCR for HCV was done in 90 patients with CD4+ T-cell count < 150 per mm(3). Serological markers for HBV infection were present in 97 (38.6%) patients. Thirty six of them (37.1%) had isolated anti-HBc. A multivariate analysis indicated that the following risk factors were significantly associated with the presence of these markers: age (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.08), pediculosis pubis (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.01-3.33), men who have sex with men and women (OR = 3.23, 95% CI: 1.46-7.13) and men who have sex only with men (OR = 3.73, 95% CI: 1.58-8.78). The same analysis restricted to women showed syphilis as the only significant risk factor. Thus, HBV infection was considerably associated with high risk sexual behavior. HCV was present in only two (0.8%) of HIV patients. Both of them were positive by RT-PCR and anti-HCV. This low frequency of HIV/HCV coinfection was probably due to the uncommon intravenous drug abuse in this population. The frequent finding of isolated anti-HBc warrants molecular approaches to rule out the presence of cryptic HBV infection."
18089,0.008333333333333333,5.0000,"The rate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression or death of individuals coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is conflicting. The complete-case analysis systematically used, excludes patients unscreened for HCV. Our objective was to assess if rate of survival differed between HIV-infected patients screened and unscreened for HCV in a hospital-based prospective cohort study. Patients were enrolled in the Lyon section of the French Hospital Database on HIV between 1 July 1992 and 31 May 2005. A multivariate Cox regression model was used to analyse the association of HCV screening with survival. Of 3244 patients, 299 (9.2%) were not screened for HCV. The populations screened and unscreened differed by the proportion of acquired immune deficiency syndrome at baseline, presumed route of infection, CD4 cell count category at baseline, mean duration of follow-up, mean number of visits per year, type of antiretroviral therapy and survival. The rate of progression to death was higher for non-HCV-screened vs HCV-screened patients: the incidence rate among HCV-screened patients was 22.9/1000 patient-years; the incidence rate among HCV-unscreened patients was 52.4/1000 patient-years. The adjusted hazards ratio of death was 2.48 [95% confidence interval (1.83-3.35); P < 0.001] for patients with unknown HCV status compared with others. In conclusion, unscreened or unknown HCV status was associated with an increased risk of death in our hospital cohort. Important prognostic factors are related to, or confounded by the practice of HCV screening."
9473,0.008333333333333333,5.0000,"The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and genetic variability of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among 205 patients with clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in Buenos Aires in 2001. Infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV), HIV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV), Treponema pallidum and human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I/II were diagnosed in 37/187 (19.8 %), 35/205 (17.1 %), 22/187 (11.8 %), 13/187 (7.0 %) and 4/181 (2.2 %) patients, respectively. Almost one in three participants (33.1 %) presented at least one infection in addition to TB. Multiresistance to TB drugs (isoniazid plus rifampicin) was detected in the isolates recovered from three patients. Injecting drug use was detected as the main risk factor for HIV, HBV and HCV infections. Of ten patients who died, eight were infected with HIV. HIV genetic characterization showed the presence of two different subtypes. Env subtype F was found in 13/24 samples (54.2 %) and subtype B in 11/24 samples (45.8 %) by heteroduplex mobility assay. Sequencing of the protease/RT region was performed in ten samples: three were characterized as subtype B and seven as B/F recombinants by bootscanning analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of four full-length sequences showed that three were the circulating recombinant form CRF12_BF. The results of this study suggest an urgent need to detect HIV infection in high-risk groups to prevent future HIV transmission as well as morbidity and mortality associated with TB by providing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and/or TB treatment. Collaboration between TB and HIV programmes seems to be the best approach to decrease the incidence of these diseases, especially in high-prevalence HIV settings."

Time to diagnosis of dementia among individuals was examined on the basis of zidovudine duration, CD4+ cell count at first treatment, gender, and transmission group [men having sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users (IDU), heterosexuals]. We restricted the analysis to subjects with CD4+ cells counts within 12 months prior to treatment start date. Among 641 participants eligible for analysis, median duration of follow-up was 3.6 years, under which 86 (9.3%) events of dementia occurred. Participants were less likely to develop dementia with: increased zidovudine exposure (OR=0.26, 95% CI: 0.14-0.49), at least 260 CD4+ cells/mm3 (median) (OR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.34-0.78), and MSM risk group (OR=0.57, 95% CI: 0.35-0.94). Those infected through heterosexual contact had an increased risk (RR=2.04, 95% CI: 1.02-4.07). Using Cox's proportional hazards model, controlling for CD4+ cell count at treatment start date, independent predictors of dementia-free survival were: duration of zidovudine (OR=0.28, 95% CI: 0.15-0.52) and MSM transmission group (OR=0.61, 95% CI: 0.37-1.00). In this observational treatment cohort, factors associated with dementia-free survival include duration of zidovudine (AZT) therapy and MSM transmission group. It is not clear from these data whether the AZT protective effect is exclusive to this agent or whether other therapies might offer a similar protective effect."
14001,0.008333333333333333,5.0000,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is paramount for virological suppression and positive treatment outcomes. ART has been rapidly scaled up in Papua New Guinea (PNG) in recent years, however clinical monitoring of HIV+ individuals on ART is limited. A cross-sectional study was conducted at two major sexual health clinics in high HIV prevalence provinces in the Highlands Region of PNG to assess ART adherence, factors affecting adherence and the relationship between ART adherence and virological outcomes. Ninety-five HIV+ individuals were recruited and administered a questionnaire to gather demographic and ART adherence information whilst clinical data and pill counts were extracted from patient charts and blood was collected for viral load testing. Bivariate analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of ART adherence. Fourteen percent (n = 12) of participants showed evidence of virological failure. Although the majority of participants self-reported excellent ART adherence in the last seven days (78.9%, 75/91), pill count measurements indicated only 40% (34/84) with >95% adherence in the last month. Taking other medications while on ART (p = 0.01) and taking ART for ≥1 year (p = 0.037) were positively associated with adherence by self-report and pill count, respectively. Participants who had never heard of drug resistance were more likely to show virological failure (p = 0.033). Misconception on routes of HIV transmission still persists in the studied population. These findings indicate that non-adherence to ART is high in this region of PNG and continued education and strategies to improve adherence are required to ensure the efficacy of ART and prevent HIV drug resistance.

3497,0.008333333333333333,5.0000,"Darunavir is an oral nonpeptidic HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI) that is used, together with a low boosting dose of ritonavir, as part of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen in treatment-experienced and -naive patients with HIV-1 infection. Compared with early-generation PIs, boosted darunavir has a high genetic barrier to resistance and is active against multidrug-resistant HIV isolates. In clinical trials in treatment-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection receiving an optimized background regimen (OBR), twice-daily boosted darunavir was more effective than investigator-selected ritonavir-boosted control PIs (CPIs) or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir. In clinical trials in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1 infection receiving a fixed background regimen, once-daily boosted darunavir was noninferior to boosted lopinavir at 48 weeks and more effective than boosted lopinavir at 96weeks. Boosted darunavir was generally well tolerated in patients with HIV-1 infection in clinical trials. It was associated with a lower incidence of diarrhoea than CPIs or lopinavir in treatment-experienced or -naive patients, and fewer lipid abnormalities than lopinavir in treatment-naive patients. Thus, for the management of treatment-experienced or -naive patients with HIV-1 infection, a ritonavir-boosted darunavir-based ART regimen is a valuable treatment option. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES: Darunavir is an oral nonpeptidic HIV-1 PI that selectively inhibits the cleavage of HIV gag and gag-pol polyproteins, thereby preventing viral maturation. Darunavir is highly potent against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of wild-type and multidrug-resistant HIV and has limited cytotoxicity. In an in vitro study in MT-2 cells, the potency of darunavir was greater than that of saquinavir, amprenavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, lopinavir and ritonavir. Darunavir binds with high affinity to HIV-1 protease, including multidrug-resistant proteases, and retains potency against multidrug-resistant HIV-1 strains. Although some potential may exist for cross-resistance with amprenavir, darunavir did not display cross-resistance with other PIs in vitro. In a 24-week analysis of pooled data from the POWER 1 and 2 studies in treatment-experienced patients, 11 protease mutations associated with a reduced response to boosted darunavir were identified (V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L/M, G73S, L76V, I84V and L89V). The presence of at least three darunavir resistance-associated mutations (prevalent in approximately 7-9% of treatment-experienced patients) together with a high number of protease resistance-associated mutations were required to confer darunavir resistance. In the 48-week analysis of treatment-experienced patients with virological failure in the the TITAN study, fewer in the boosted darunavir group than in the boosted lopinavir group developed additional mutations or lost susceptibility to PIs compared with baseline. In treatment-naive patients, no primary PI-resistance-associated mutations developed in patients with an available genotype at baseline and endpoint during 96 weeks of treatment with boosted darunavir or boosted lopinavir. Oral darunavir, boosted with low-dose ritonavir, is rapidly absorbed, generally reaching peak plasma concentrations within 2.5-4 hours. The bioavailability of oral darunavir is increased by about 30% when taken with food. Darunavir is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, primarily CYP3A. The 'boosting' dose of ritonavir acts an an inhibitor of CYP3A, thereby increasing darunavir bioavailability. Drug interactions can result when darunavir is coadministered with other drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of, or act as substrates for, CYP3A. The mean elimination half-life of boosted darunavir is approximately 15 hours. THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY: In treatment-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection, the therapeutic efficacy of oral twice-daily darunavir 600 mg, boosted with ritonavir 100 mg, versus that of investigator selected boosted CPIs (POWER studies) or versus twice-daily boosted lopinavir (administered as a fixed dose combination of lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg) [TITAN study] has been evaluated in phase IIb and III studies. All patients received concurrent treatment with an OBR. Significantly more patients receiving boosted darunavir achieved a viral load reduction from baseline of >or=1 log(10) copies/mL (primary endpoint) than boosted CPI recipients at all timepoints, up to and including the final efficacy analysis at 144 weeks, in the combined analyses of POWER 1 and 2. The efficacy of boosted darunavir was noninferior to that of boosted lopinavir at 48 weeks, and was significantly better than boosted lopinavir at 48 and 96 weeks in the TITAN study, as determined by significantly more patients in the darunavir group than in the lopinavir group achieving a viral load of <400 copies/mL (primary endpoint). In the ARTEMIS study in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1 infection receiving a fixed background regimen of tenofovir and emtricitabine, once-daily boosted darunavir 800 mg was noninferior to boosted lopinavir 800 mg/day at 48 weeks. At 96 weeks, boosted darunavir was found to be more effective than boosted lopinavir, as determined by significantly more patients in the darunavir group than in the lopinavir group achieving a confirmed plasma viral load of <50 copies/mL (primary endpoint)."
6488,0.008333333333333333,5.0000,"In Japan, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection of some patients with hemophilia was caused by the transfusion of imported blood products, such as unheated coagulation factor. With the development of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV, chronic HCV infection has become a major cause of liver disease and mortality for hemophiliac patients coinfected with HCV/HIV. Data is limited regarding the efficacy and safety of antiviral therapy with the HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir (TVR) in combination with pegylated interferon-α (PegIFN-α) and ribavirin (RBV) for hemophilia patients coinfected with HCV/HIV. We report a case of a Japanese patient with hemophilia and HCV/HIV coinfection who had partial response to prior to PegIFN-α and RBV therapy. This is the first published report of 24-week TVR-based triple therapy for a hemophilia patient coinfected with HCV/HIV. The patient had HCV genotype 1a infection with a high viral load. His single-nucleotide polymorphism of the interleukin 28B (rs8099917) gene was the TT major allele. He presented with undetectable HIV RNA and a high CD4(+) T cell counts by taking ART including tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir. He was again treated for HCV with TVR plus PegIFN-α2b and RBV for the first 12 weeks, followed by the continuation of PegIFN-α2b and RBV for 12 additional weeks while continuing ART. He had rapid virological response and achieved sustained virological response with the 24-week treatment. No serious adverse events such as skin rash, severe anemia or exacerbated bleeding tendency were observed, only a mild headache. No dose adjustment was necessary when tenofovir and raltegravir were used in combined with TVR, and no HIV breakthrough was observed. TVR-based triple therapy with ART could can an effective treatment for hemophilia patients coinfected with HCV (genotype 1)/HIV regardless of prior response. TVR can be used in combination with tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir for patients with hemophilia. Furthermore, patients with undetectable HCV RNA at week 4 could be successfully treated with a 24-week regimen. "
17760,0.008333333333333333,5.0000,"Hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection is a major health burden in the Asia-Pacific region. The seriousness of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is often realized at a late stage. The resultant morbidity and mortality from cirrhosis complications is considerable, with a high human cost. The most affected patients are men aged 40 years or older. Two decades ago, the prognosis for the 300 million ""Australia antigen""-positive people (people with chronic HBV infection) was gloomy, with no effective intervention. Twenty years on, research and development have changed their outlook. Chronic hepatitis should now be diagnosed early, at the asymptomatic stage. Proper assessment and judicial introduction of therapy can suppress replication of HBV and resolve liver inflammation, thereby preventing the silent progression of chronic liver disease to end-stage cirrhosis. Interferon (IFN) monotherapy has been available for nearly 20 years, but various limitations restrict its general application. Injection-based therapies are inconvenient, the response rate is low (33% hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion rate among optimal cases), side-effects are many, and some serious, and the cost is unaffordable for most people. However, in non-cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate disease activity, IFN is still a worthwhile option because the treatment course is shorter, mutation seems less of a problem and most responses are permanent and reduce or abolish late complications. Lamivudine, an oral nucleoside analog with potent antiviral effects, has been approved in many countries. Daily dosing of 100 mg reduces serum HBV-DNA to below detectable levels within 6 weeks. In HBeAg-positive patients, approximately 16% of treated patients seroconverted with the first year. This was associated with significant improvement in liver histology. Long-term treatment induces further HBeAg seroconversion, but overall clinical benefit is undermined by continuous emergence of drug-resistant YMDD mutants. In an Asian multicentre study, 58 patients on 5 years lamivudine therapy showed annual cumulative HBeAg seroconversion rates at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years of 22, 29, 40, 47 and 50%, respectively. The best predictor of response is pretreatment alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Among patients with ALT > 2x the upper limit of normal (ULN), annual HBeAg seroconversion is increased to 38, 42, 65, 73 and 77%, respectively. However, emergence of YMDD mutants occurred at a cumulative rate of 15, 38, 55, 67 and 69%, respectively. The impact of this emergence on disease activity is unpredictable. Thus, while continued disease suppression, or even HBeAg seroconversion, still occurred in some patients, in others hepatitis may relapse and liver failure has been reported despite continuation of lamivudine. While the duration of lamivudine therapy is difficult to define, the best strategy may be to define only active CHB with major ALT elevation (par-ticularly ALT > 5x ULN) for a duration of 1 year or less. Lamivudine can be stopped in responders. The response is durable in approximately 80% of responders. Non-responders should be monitored closely for rebound off treatment. Therapy can be re-instituted if ALT is over 5x ULN. Management of patients with YMDD mutants can be challenging, but there is no clear evidence to recommend stopping or continuing lamivudine, or to add other possible effective agents, such as adefovir dipivoxil. More data are required to help draw up guidelines. Hepatitis B e antigen-negative CHB has been less well studied. Both IFN and lamivudine can suppress disease activity, but permanent responses are few. Without a distinct marker as an end-point for response, the duration of treatment is even more difficult to define. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction for low viral levels may give a clue, but definitive studies are required. Monotherapy is clearly not the answer for the majority of CHB patients with active disease. Combination therapy has the theoretical advantage of additional or synergistic efficacy. Preliminary results on IFN and lamivudine are promising and further clinical trials are ongoing. Emtricitabine (FTC), adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, BL-thymidine (L-dT), DAPD, clevudine (l-FMAU), thymosin, therapeutic vaccines and various herbal medicines are potential candidates. Antiviral action in conjunction with immune modulation may have a better chance of eradicating HBV and its cccDNA in the hepatocytes as the basis for an eventual successful outcome. The key points are: (i) approved therapeutic agents for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are IFN, lamivudine and thymosin (in a few countries only); (ii) indications for IFN therapy are viremia in compensated CHB patients with moderately raised ALT; (iii) lamivudine has broader therapeutic indications: it is effective in subgroups of CHB patients with compensated or decompensated liver diseases, but generally works better if patients have raised ALT; (iv) lamivudine has a potent suppressive action on HBV replication, including HBeAg-negative variants, but cannot eliminate cccDNA; this is the reason for the relapse of disease after discontinuing treatment, unless HBeAg seroconversion is obtained; (v) successful use of lamivudine aims at HBeAg seroconversion or profound suppression of HBV-DNA to serum levels of less than 100 000 viral copies/mL, in order to prevent emergence of drug-resistant YMDD mutants (which commences from 6 months onward); (vi) YMDD mutants may cause a flare of hepatitis, resulting in deterioration of liver histology and, occasionally, liver failure; (vii) combination therapy of lamivudine with IFN (standard or pegylated) or other nucleoside analogs should be the next advance. Preliminary data from IFN and lamivudine combination therapy show some promise, but there are conflicting results."

Little is known about hepatitis C (HCV) status and discontinuation of HAART. Poisson regression was used to determine factors related to discontinuation of any part of an initial HAART regimen due to treatment failure (TF) or toxicities and patient/physician choice (TOX), and to investigate the relationship between HCV and discontinuation of a HAART regimen in 1198 patients staring HAART after 1999 from the EuroSIDA study. At 1 year after starting HAART, 70% of patients remained on their original regimen, 24% had changed, and 6% were off all treatment. The most frequent reason for discontinuation was toxicities (30.4%). There was no change over time in the proportion of patients discontinuing after stratification by reason for discontinuation (p = 0.18). Of patients 190 stopped at least one antiretroviral drug used in their initial HAART regimen due to toxicities; the toxicity reported did not vary according to HCV status (p = 0.90). Anti-HCV seropositive patients had a higher incidence of discontinuation due to TOX (IRR 1.46, 95% CI 1.13-1.88, p = 0.0042) compared to patients without HCV. Patients with HCV were more likely to discontinue all or part of their HAART regimens due to toxicity or patient/physician choice. Managing adverse events must remain a key intervention in maintaining HAART. There is a need for further studies to describe the relationship between HCV, specific antiretrovirals, and different treatment strategies."
5384,0.008333333333333333,5.0000,"Insulin resistance is associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients, and the risk of developing insulin resistance is increased in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients. The aim of the present study was to determine whether hepatitis C virus infection constitutes an additional risk factor for insulin resistance or other prothrombotic conditions in HIV-HCV coinfected patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy. One hundred eighteen HIV-infected patients were studied: 50 who had no history of anti-HIV treatment and 68 who were receiving therapy with highly active antiretroviral treatment. The treatment-naive group consisted of 35 HCV-negative subjects and 15 HCV-positive ones. Within the treated group, 50 patients were HCV negative and 18 were HCV positive. For each patient, the lipid profile was determined and the following values measured: glucose, soluble P-selectin (as a marker of platelet activation), soluble thrombomodulin, von Willebrand factor and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (as endothelial markers), and insulin resistance. No significant difference (p>0.05) for any variable was found among subjects with or without HCV coinfection in the treatment-naïve group. Among patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy, however, those with HCV coinfection showed higher values (p<0.05) for insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment value: 2.65 vs. 1.79), glucose (93 vs. 86 mg/dl), endothelial markers (von Willebrand factor, 204 vs. 123%; soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, 650 vs. 482 ng/ml), and platelet activation marker (soluble P-selectin, 78 vs. 51 ng/ml) in parallel with lower CD4+ cells counts (289 vs. 402 cells/mm3) and higher HIV-1 viral loads (305 vs. 50 copies/ml) compared to patients without HCV coinfection. Glucose, soluble P-selectin, and von Willebrand factor were independently related to HCV infection. The presence of HCV coinfection during HIV treatment was closely related to higher values of insulin resistance, to activated platelets, and to endothelial perturbation in parallel with lower CD4+ cell counts and higher HIV-1 viral loads compared to patients without HCV coinfection. On the basis of these results, it may be preferable to treat HCV infection prior to initiating treatment for HIV infection in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients."

In this paper, we report results of an investigation of drug use and sexual behavior associated with HTLV-I infection among male and female injecting drug users (IDUs) in Salvador. A cross sectional study was conducted in the Historical District of Salvador from 1994-1996 (Projeto Brasil-Salvador) and 216 asymptomatic IDUs were selected using the snowball contact technique. Blood samples were collected for serological assays. Sera were screened for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1/2) and HTLV-I/II antibodies by ELISA and confirmed by Western blot. The overall prevalence of HTLV-I/II was 35.2% (76/216). The seroprevalence of HTLV-I, HTLV-II and HIV-I was for males 22%, 11.3% and 44.1% and for females 46.2%, 10.3% and 74.4% respectively. HTLV-I was identified in 72.4% of HTLV positive IDUs. Variables which were significantly associated with HTLV-I infection among males included needle sharing practices, duration of injecting drug use, HIV-I seropositivity and syphilis. Among women, duration of injecting drug use and syphilis were strongly associated with HTLV-I infection. Multivariate analysis did not change the direction of these associations. Sexual intercourse might play a more important role in HTLV-I infection among women than in men."

Given the poor nutritional status common to people who drink alcohol, food insecurity may be particularly problematic for HIV positive individuals who drink alcohol. To examine food insecurity among HIV positive men and women who drink alcohol and its association with antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, health outcomes and health service utilization. Adults living with HIV (N = 183) in Atlanta, Georgia who reported alcohol use in the previous week and were receiving ART participated in a 12-month cohort. Participants were recruited from infectious disease clinics and social services to complete computerized interviews, monthly-unannounced pill counts to monitor ART adherence, and daily cell-phone delivered interactive-text assessments for alcohol use. Forty-three percent of participants experienced food insecurity during at least one month of the study period. Food insecurity was independently associated with suboptimal ART adherence and less suppressed HIV viral load over. Individuals who experienced food insecurity also had histories of more medical and psychiatric hospitalizations, and greater mental health problems. Food insecurity is prevalent among alcohol using people receiving ART and food insecurity is associated with treatment non-adherence, poor health outcomes, and increased medical and psychiatric hospitalizations."

Childhood abuse history has been associated with worse antiretroviral adherence and negative health behaviours in HIV-infected patients. This study evaluates the relationship between childhood abuse and the timing of presentation for HIV care. Participants in a multi-center prospective cohort study, who established initial HIV care after January 1996 and had a CD4 count available within six months of initial presentation, were included in this analysis. Bivariate contingency tables and multivariate logistic regression were used to evaluate the association of childhood abuse with early presentation for HIV care (initial CD4 count > or =200/mm3). Among the 186 subjects included in this analysis, 33% had childhood abuse histories and 58% had an initial CD4 count > or =200/mm3. Participants with a history of childhood abuse were more likely to present early for HIV care (AOR=2.12; p=0.03), perhaps because survivors of abuse tend to have higher utilization of health services. Because HIV-infected patients with childhood abuse histories have worse antiretroviral medication adherence and are more likely to engage in high-risk sexual and injection drug use behaviours, early presentation affords clinicians the opportunity for timely institution of interventions that may improve patient outcomes and prevent secondary HIV infections."

However, the prevalence of hypogonadism is not known among men with weight loss related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). From 1997 through 1999, we investigated total and free testosterone levels in 90 men who were <90% of ideal body weight or had weight loss of >10% from preillness weight; 71% of these subjects were receiving HAART. Twenty-one percent of the subjects receiving HAART had low free testosterone levels. No correlation was seen between weight, CD4 cell count, medication status, and other clinical factors. These data suggest that hypogonadism remains relatively common in men with AIDS wasting, despite treatment with HAART. HIV-infected men with wasting syndrome should be screened for hypogonadism and receive physiological androgen replacement therapy if they are hypogonadal."

With the development of HIV infection in Chad, tuberculosis has quickly become a major public health concern. The purpose of this cross-sectional study in two tuberculosis centres (Moundou and Ndjamena) was to evaluate HIV seroprevalence, epidemiological characteristics and risk factors in patients with tuberculosis. All patients with positive sputum-smears who had never been treated for tuberculosis previously were eligible. A total of 466 patients (sex ratio M/F: 1.96) were included during the six-month period between January and June 99. Each subject was asked to fill out an anonymous standardized questionnaire with detailed information on demographic characteristics, sexual behavior and other risk factors for HIV infection. Data were compared using the Chi-square test, Student's T test and multivariate analysis (logistic regression). One third (33.2%) of patients was seropositive for HIV-1. Mean age was 31.1 years in HIV-positive group and 33.6 years in the HIV-negative group (p = 0.02). The age groups with the highest risk for HIV were 20-29 years and 30-39 years (p < 0.01). Women were more often seropositive that men (39.5% versus 30.1%; p = 0.04). Seropositive patients were more likely to have multiple sexual partners (mean: 1.76; p < 0.01) and a history of sexually transmitted disease (19.9% versus 8.1%; p = 0.01). The mean age at the time of first sexual relations was 16.3 years in the HIV group and 17.1 years in the control (p < 0.01). The percentage of seropositive patients was 39.6% at Moundou and 29.8% at N'djamena (p > 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that early age of first sex relation (OR = 0.85; 95% IC: 0.74-0.97), higher number of sexual partners (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.4-2.4) and level of education were strongly correlated with HIV infection. The prevalence of HIV in tuberculosis patients is a good indicator of HIV-infection in developing countries. Prevalence of HIV infection is high in tuberculosis patients in Chad. Surveillance for tuberculosis and AIDS must be strengthened in Chad. Mores cooperation is needed between tuberculosis and AIDS control programs. Emphasis should be placed on screening for tuberculosis, early tuberculosis treatment and diagnosis of HIV in tuberculosis patients."

PLWH with the added burden of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection possess unique challenges that potentially impact their motivation and ability to adhere to ART. The present investigation sought to (1) compare ART adherence levels among a sample of HIV/HCV-coinfected versus HIV-monoinfected patients, and (2) identify whether ART-related clinical and psychosocial correlates differ by HCV status. PLWH receiving ART (N = 215: 105 HIV/HCV-coinfected, 110 HIV-monoinfected) completed a comprehensive survey assessing ART adherence and its potential correlates. Medical chart extraction identified clinical factors, including liver enzymes. Results demonstrated that ART adherence did not differ by HCV status, with 83.7% of coinfected patients and 82.4% of monoinfected patients reporting optimal (i.e., ≥95%) adherence during a four-day recall period (p = .809). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that regardless of HCV status, optimal ART adherence was associated with experiencing fewer adherence-related behavioral skills barriers (AOR = 0.56; 95%CI = 0.43-0.73), lower likelihood of problematic drinking (AOR = 0.15; 95%CI = 0.04-0.67), and lower likelihood of methamphetamine use (AOR = 0.14; 95%CI = 0.03-0.69). However, among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, optimal adherence was additionally associated with experiencing fewer ART adherence-related motivational barriers (AOR = 0.23; 95%CI = 0.08-0.62) and lower likelihood of depression (AOR = 0.06; 95%CI = 0.00-0.84). Findings suggest that although HIV/HCV-coinfected patients may face additional, distinct barriers to ART adherence, levels of adherence commensurate with those demonstrated by HIV-monoinfected patients might be achievable if these barriers are addressed."

A practical way to regularly screen HIV-infected patients for acute HCV irrespective of perceived risk or symptoms is needed. We piloted implementation of an acute HCV screening strategy using routine HIV clinical care schedules and the least costly blood tests, in a Rhode Island HIV care center. Study participants had ongoing HCV risk, completed questionnaires encompassing risk behaviors and perception of risk, and were screened with quarterly alanine aminotransferase (ALT). ALT rise triggered HCV RNA testing, with pooled rather than individual specimen HCV RNA testing for underinsured participants. Participants were primarily older, college-educated men who have sex with men (MSM) with history of sexually transmitted infection other than HIV. One of 58 participants developed acute HCV in 50 person-years of observation for an annual incidence of 2.0% per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05-11.1%). The majority (54%) of MSM did not perceive that traumatic sexual and drug practices they were engaging in put them at risk for HCV. Unprotected sex often occurred under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Self-reported HCV risk and participation in several risk behaviors declined during the study. It was possible to collect frequent ALTs in a busy HIV clinic with 71% of total projected ALTs obtained and 88% of participants having at least one ALT during the 9-month follow-up period. All instances of ALT rise led to reflexive HCV RNA testing. Tracking quarterly ALT for elevation to systematically prompt HCV RNA testing before seroconversion is a promising approach to screen for acute HCV in a real-world HIV clinical setting."

This review summarizes the results of 20 studies investigating the issue of barriers to optimal highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence. Only a few determinants were consistently associated with nonadherence. Symptoms and adverse drug effects, psychologic distress, lack of social or family support, complexity of the HAART regimen, low patient self-efficacy, and inconvenience of treatment were the factors most consistently associated with nonadherence. There were inconsistent findings regarding the relationship of adherence and the following variables: sociodemographic characteristics, substance abuse, depressive symptoms, quality of life, CD4+ cell count, knowledge and beliefs about treatment, patients' satisfaction with health care, and patient-provider relationship. A synthesis of findings relating various factors to adherence to HAART is difficult to reach because of several limitations of the existing body of research. These limitations concern the measurement of adherence, the assessment of correlates and predictors of adherence, the study population, and the study design."

Data from 1,287 participants enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study between 1985 and 2010 were used. Genotyping was conducted with Illumina 1M, 1MDuo, or 550K platform. Linear mixed models determined subject-specific slopes for change over time in processing speed and executive functioning, considering all visits including baseline and the most recent study visit. Covariates modeled as fixed effects included: time since the first visit, depression severity, nadir CD4+ T-cell count, hepatitis C co-infection, substance use, and antiretroviral medication regimen. Prevalence of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) and neurocognitive impairment (NCI) was also examined as neurocognitive phenotypes in a case-control analysis. No genetic susceptibility loci were associated with decline in processing speed or executive functioning among almost 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) directly genotyped or imputed. No association between the SNPs and HAD or NCI were found. Previously reported associations between specific genetic susceptibility loci, HIV-associated NCI, and HAD were not validated. In this first GWAS of HAND, no novel or previously identified genetic susceptibility loci were associated with any of the phenotypes examined.

A cross-sectional study was carried out to estimate the prevalence of HCV seropositivity in a cohort of people living with HIV/AIDS in Santos, Brazil, and to investigate potential risk factors for HCV infection. Anti-HCV antibodies were sought by using two immunoenzymatic assays. Overall HCV seroprevalence was 36.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31.9-40.4%). However, it was significantly higher (84.8%, 95% CI 78.2-91.3%) among intravenous drug users (IDU) as compared to non-IDU (20.9%, 95% CI 16.8-25.1%) (p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that HCV seropositivity among IDU was independently associated with needle sharing (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] = 4.28, p = 0.07) and with serologic evidence of exposure to other bloodborne agents: HBV (adjOR = 4.39, p = 0.01) and HTLV-I/II (adjOR = 6.43, p = 0.02). In contrast, no association with lifetime number of sexual partners, history of STD, or of sex with commercial sex workers (CSW) could be demonstrated. Among non-IDU, HCV seropositivity was independently associated with sexual partnership with IDU (adjOR = 2.15, p = 0.08) and with HBV seropositivity (adjOR = 1.71, p = 0.05), but not with engaging in oral or anal receptive intercourse or having sex with CSW. Results indicate that exposure to blood and sexual partnership with IDU constitute the main risk factors for HCV acquisition among HIV-positive patients in Santos, Brazil. Prevention of HCV spread in this population should thus include harm reduction measures and information on safer sex practices for both IDU and their sexual partners."
15856,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"Improved awareness of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission has contributed to the overall decline in the HCV infection rate in some developing countries including Thailand. Chronic HCV infection in some rural Thai communities, however, presents a challenge in the efforts to treat and manage HCV-related diseases. Published and unpublished studies have suggested an unusually high incidence of HCV infection in a Thai province of Phetchabun compared to elsewhere in Thailand. To determine the magnitude of HCV infection and identify potential factors contributing to the higher rate of HCV infection in this province, we performed a population-based study in Phetchabun (n = 1667) and the neighboring Khon Kaen province (n = 1410) where HCV prevalence is much lower. Individuals between 30 and 64 years old completed detailed questionnaires designed to identify HCV risk factors and provided blood samples for anti-HCV antibody screening. The anti-HCV seropositive rates were 15.5% (259/1667) in Phetchabun and 3.6% (51/1410) in Khon Kaen. Positive samples were subsequently genotyped for HCV core gene sequence and assessed for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and human immunodeficiency virus antigen/antibody (HIV Ag/Ab). More individuals in Phetchabun possessed the combined presence of HBsAg (5.0%) and HIV Ag/Ab (0.4%) than those in Khon Kaen (3.9% HBsAg and 0.0% HIV Ag/Ab). While male gender, intravenous drug use (IVDU) and tattoos were significant HCV risk factors in both provinces (p <0.05), education less than high school and agriculture-related occupation were additionally associated with HCV in Phetchabun. HCV genotypes 6, 3, and 1 were identified in similar frequency in both provinces. We estimated that prevalence of HCV seropositivity and viremic carriers were higher in Phetchabun (143 and 111 per 1000) than in Khon Kaen (34 and 22 per 1000). Finally, we derived a simple risk factor-based scoring system as a useful preclinical tool to screen individuals at risk of chronic HCV infection prior to intervention. Knowledge gained from this study will assist in HCV screening and promote access to anti-viral treatment in high-risk groups."

We analyzed Medicaid claims data from 14 southern states from 2005 to 2007, comparing survival and clinical outcomes and cost of treatment for HIV and HCV coinfected patients (N = 4115) at different levels of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). More than one in five patients (20.5%) showed less than 50% adherence to antiretroviral treatment, but there were no racial/ethnic or gender disparities. Significant survival benefit was demonstrated at each incremental level of adherence to ART (one-year mortality ranging from 3.5% in the highest adherence group to 26.0% in the lowest). Low-adherence patients also had higher rates of hospitalization and emergency department visits. Relative to patients with high (>95%) ART adherence, those with less than 25% treatment adherence had fourfold greater risk of death (adjusted odds ratio 4.22 [95% CI: 3.03, 5.87]). Nondrug Medicaid expenditures were lower for high-adherence patients, but cost of medications drove total Medicaid expenditures higher for high-adherence patients. Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved (relative to the <25% low-adherence group) ranged from $21,874 for increasing adherence to 25-50% to $37,229 for increasing adherence to 75-95%. Adherence to ART for patients with HIV and HCV coinfection is associated with lower adverse clinical outcomes at a Medicaid cost per QALY commensurate with other well-accepted treatment and prevention strategies. Further research is needed to identify interventions which can best achieve optimal ART adherence at a population scale."
9594,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"Syphilis is a frequent coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Whereas systemic syphilis infection increases plasma HIV RNA levels (viral load; VL), effects of syphilis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VL are unknown. We hypothesized that intrathecal immune activation in neurosyphilis would selectively increase CSF VL in coinfected patients. In this study, HIV-infected research subjects (N = 225) were categorized into three groups based on serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR), microhemaglutination for Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP) MHA-TP, and CSF VDRL: 23 with neurosyphilis (NS+; reactive serum RPR and MHA-TP and positive CSF VDRL); 42 with systemic syphilis but not neurosyphilis (Syph+; reactive serum RPR and MHA-TP; negative CSF VDRL), and 160 without syphilis (Syph-; nonreactive serum RPR). Plasma and CSF HIV VL were quantified by reverse transcriptase-ploymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Amplicor, Roche) in log(10) copies/ml. To adjust for covariates previously shown to influence CSF HIV VL (i.e., plasma VL, CD4, pleocytosis, and highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]), multivariable linear regression was used. Lumbar punctures (LP) done for research purposes diagnosed 23 with neurosyphilis; most (83%) of these reported prior syphilis treatment. Among subjects with detectable plasma VL, CSF VL was highest in NS+, followed by Syph+ and Syph- (P =.006). This relationship was independent of the level of plasma VL or CSF pleocytosis. By contrast, among subjects with undetectable plasma HIV VL, CSF VLs were similar in the three syphilis subgroups (P = .50). Neurosyphilis may amplify intrathecal HIV replication, possibly through immune activation that persists even after syphilis treatment. Because elevated CSF VL is associated with subsequent neurocognitive decline, future studies should evaluate the impact of neurosyphilis on the course of central nervous system (CNS) HIV infection."

Nevertheless, there are few well-documented studies about HIV and syphilis co-infection and its risk factors. The study was based on 2262 HIV infected individuals from South Brazilian HIV cohort, which began in 1991, and this analysis included individuals who were included in the cohort until November 2008. Inclusion criteria were having CD4 + T cell count and viral load at baseline, and syphilis serology tests (venereal disease research laboratory [VDRL] > 1:64 or a positive VDRL plus a positive treponemal test). A total of 1012 patients were included; 580 were men (57%); mean age at HIV diagnosis was 33 years; 591 (58%) had previous diagnosis of AIDS; most of the individuals acquired HIV from sexual contact (47.9% heterosexual and 31.7% men who had sex with men [MSM]); and 759 (75%) were on antiretroviral therapy. The prevalence of syphilis was 20.5% (208). After multivariate analysis, being male (2.01; 95% CI, 1.23-3.27; p = 0.005) and MSM (1.91; 95% CI, 1.25-2.90; p = 0.002) were significantly associated to HIV and syphilis co-infection. Males and MSM were associated with higher risk of this co-infection. Our findings may reflect that this particular population is still engaging in unprotected sexual intercourse, and efforts should be made to better target this specific group as they might perpetuate these infections."

Consistent adherence and use of safe sex practices may substantially decrease the risk of HIV transmission. We sought to explore the potential association between self-reported nonadherence to ART and engaging in unsafe sexual practices capable of transmitting HIV. Using clinical and audio computer-assisted self-interview data from the prospective HIV Outpatient Study from 2007 to 2014, we assessed the frequency of self-reported ART nonadherence during the three days prior to the survey among HIV-infected persons in care and factors associated with self-reported ART nonadherence. Of 1729 patients included in this analysis (median age = 48 years, 74.3% men who have sex with men), 17% were nonadherent, 15% had a detectable VL, and 42% reported condomless anal or vaginal sex in the past six months. In multivariable analysis, self-reported nonadherence was independently associated with younger age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.8 per additional ten years, [95% CI] 0.7-1.0), non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity (aOR 1.9; 95% CI 1.4-2.6 versus white), public health insurance (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.3 compared with private), survey date in 2011-2014 versus 2007-2010 (aOR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9), CD4 cell count ≥ 500 versus < 200 cells/mm"

We studied the associations between retention in methadone treatment and drug use behaviors and incidence of hepatitis B and C in a cohort of IDUs in the Seattle, Washington, area. Data on IDUs entering methadone treatment at four centers in King County, Washington, were collected through face-to-face interviews using a standardized questionnaire at baseline and 12-month follow-up between October 1994 and January 1998. Blood specimens were obtained and tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C. Drug treatment status at follow-up was analyzed in relation to study enrollment characteristics and potential treatment outcomes, including injection risk behaviors, cessation or reduced frequency of injection, and incidence of hepatitis B and C. Of 716 IDUs, 292 (41%) left treatment, 198 (28%) disrupted (left and returned) treatment, and 226 (32%) continued treatment throughout the 1-year follow-up period. Compared to those who left treatment, subjects who disrupted or continued were less likely to inject at follow-up (odds ratio [OR] = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.7; and OR = 0.1, 95% CI 0.1-0.2, respectively). Among the 468 (65%) subjects who continued injecting, those who continued treatment injected less frequently, were less likely to pool money to buy drugs (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8) and inject with used needles (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.2-0.8) compared to those who left treatment. Cooker or cotton sharing was not associated with retention in treatment, but hepatitis B incidence was lowest among those who continued treatment. The results of this study suggest drug use risk reduction is more likely to be achieved by those who remain in drug treatment and by those who stop injecting, but that those who drop out and return and those who continue to inject while in treatment may also benefit. This supports the role of consistent drug treatment in an overall harm-reduction strategy."

We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study of all HIV-infected patients who initiated HAART during the study period of 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2007. We compared changes in CD4(+) cell counts, percentage of full viral suppression (< 500 copies/ml) and mortality from start of HAART, as well as differences in initial HAART regimen. Three thousand six hundred and fifteen patients were included in the study, representing 22,804 person-y of observation. A total of 346 (9.6%) were categorized as IDUs. Of IDUs, 55% gained full viral control within the first y after HAART compared to 76% of non-IDUs (p = 0.0002). Absolute CD4(+) cell count and survival were lower for IDUs compared to non-IDUs (adjusted mortality rate ratio 3.6 (95% CI 2.9-4.3)). IDUs were more likely to receive a first regimen based on protease inhibitors (PIs) compared to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens for non-IDUs, and IDUs initiated HAART later than non-IDUs. In conclusion, more than half of the HIV-infected patients in Denmark infected through injecting drug use gained full viral suppression after initiating HAART. Absolute CD4(+) cell count was lower and mortality higher among IDUs than non-IDUs."

Altered body composition, recurrent opportunistic infection and a decline in immune function are associated with the progression of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to AIDS. The factors that might affect nutritional status in AIDS are numerous and include a reduced food intake, increased metabolism, malabsorption and the acute phase response to infection. It is not clear what difference nutritional intervention can make to the progression of the disease. However, there is a consensus that it has an important role to play during the course of the disease. A report was compiled to assess the requirement for a dietitian in an HIV Clinic (the Southern Alberta Clinic) and the role of the dietitian in that position. Nutritional and anthropometric data were collected from medical records. In addition, Clinic physicians were sent a questionnaire. It was found that clients, when seen by the dietitian, had lost weight and had more gastrointestinal symptoms and a lower CD4+ lymphocyte count than the average Clinic patient at their initial Clinic visit. The report recommended that all Clinic staff use body mass index as a screening tool for referral to the dietitian and that good nutrition be promoted by the Clinic as an important part of the care of the HIV infected person. The assessment recommended a 0.4 full-time equivalent position within the Southern Alberta Clinic."

We sought to characterize immune correlates associated with host protection in this population. Previous studies have demonstrated an association of peripheral eosinophilia with resistance to reinfection with schistosomes. Thus, we investigated the relationship between the percentage of circulating eosinophils and the effect of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coinfection on the susceptibility of the car washers to reinfection with schistosomes. Elevated percentages of circulating eosinophils were associated with resistance to reinfection by S. mansoni in HIV-1-seronegative persons. In the HIV-1-seropositive cohort, low CD4+-T-cell counts were associated with a less intense eosinophilia. Moreover, eosinophils from the car washers expressed high levels of FcepsilonRI beta chain, a molecule important in immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated immunity. Levels of FcepsilonRI beta chain expression correlated with serum levels of total and antigen-specific IgE for HIV-1-negative car washers, but this was not the case for individuals coinfected with HIV-1. Overall, these data further implicate eosinophils as having a potential role in development of protective immunity against schistosomes and suggest that changes associated with HIV-1 coinfection increase susceptibility to reinfection."

Therefore, we explored the longitudinal association of HDLox with progression of glycation, as evaluated by measurement of circulating forms of receptor for AGE that predict morbidity (soluble Receptors for Advanced Glycation Endproducts [sRAGE], endogenous secretory Receptors for Advanced Glycation Endproducts [esRAGE]), in people with HIV-1 (PWH; HIV-1) and uninfected (HIV-1) individuals.We retrospectively assessed if levels of plasma sRAGE and esRAGE and HDL function (reduced antioxidant function is associated with increased HDL lipid hydroperoxide content; HDLox) in a subset of participants (n = 80) from a prospective 3-year study (AIDS Clinical Trials Group A5078). Primary outcomes were baseline and yearly rates of change over 96 of 144 weeks (Δ) in HDLox in HIV-1 versus uninfected HIV-1 controls (noted as HIV-1).Higher baseline levels of sRAGE in PWH on effective anti-retroviral therapy and with low CVD risk, but not in HIV-1 persons, were independently associated with higher HDLox. EsRAGE, but not sRAGE, had consistent inverse relationships with ΔHDLox in both HIV-1 and HIV-1 persons at baseline. In HIV-1 but not in HIV-1 persons, ΔHDLox had positive and inverse relationships with ΔRAGE and ΔesRAGE, respectively.Glycation and oxidation of HDL may contribute to impaired HDL function present in PWH."

However, long-term NRTI exposure can be limited by toxicities. NRTI class-sparing alternatives are warranted in select patient populations. This is a 48-week single-center, open-label pilot study in which 60 HIV-infected adults with plasma HIV-1 RNA (<50 copies/ml) on sHAART were randomized (2:1) to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) 400/100 mg BID+raltegravir (RAL) 400 mg BID switch (LPV-r/RAL arm) or to continue on sHAART. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HIV-RNA<50 copies/ml at week 48. Secondary efficacy and immunologic and safety endpoints were evaluated. Demographics and baseline lipid profile were similar across arms. Mean entry CD4 T cell count was 493 cells/mm(3). At week 48, 92% [95% confidence interval (CI): 83-100%] of the LPV-r/RAL arm and 88% (95% CI: 75-100%) of the sHAART arm had HIV-RNA<50 copies/ml (p=0.70). Lipid profile (mean ± SEM, mg/dl, LPV-r/RAL vs. sHAART) at week 24 was total-cholesterol 194 ± 5 vs. 176 ± 9 (p=0.07), triglycerides 234 ± 30 vs. 133 ± 27 (p=0.003), and LDL-cholesterol 121 ± 6 vs. 110 ± 8 (p=0.27). There were no serious adverse events (AEs) in either arm. Regimen change occurred in three LPV-r/RAL subjects (n=1, due to LPV-r/RAL-related AEs) vs. 0 in sHAART. There were no differences between arms in bone mineral density, total body fat composition, creatinine clearance, or CD4 T cell counts at week 48. In virologically suppressed patients on HAART, switching therapy to the NRTI-sparing LPV-r/RAL combination produced similar sustained virologic suppression and immunologic profile as sHAART.

The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to classify depressive severity (none, minor and major depression) and symptom type (cognitive and somatic). Condom use was assessed over the past six months and during the last episode of sexual intercourse. A total of 386 participants had a primary sex partner, with whom 41.6% always used condoms during sex over the past six months, and 62.4% during last sex. Use of a condom during last sex was associated with having no depression and lower PHQ-9 total and cognitive and somatic subscale scores in bivariate analyses; most of these relationships were marginally significant for intercourse over the past six months. Controlling for demographics, HIV disclosure and partner HIV status, only minor depression was associated with unprotected sex. Depressive symptoms, even if not a clinical disorder, warrant early detection and treatment for promoting HIV prevention among HIV-affected couples. "
1900,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"In Bolivia, no studies have been carried out specifically on hepatitis viruses. Thus, their prevalence and circulation patterns are virtually unknown. A seroepidemiologic study was performed from 1992 to 1996 to generate a preliminary idea of the overall prevalence of infection from hepatitis B, C, D, and E viruses (HBV, HCV, HDV, and HEV, respectively) in different Bolivian population groups. Prompted by the data obtained in other areas of Latin America, the study focused on indigenous communities in the Amazon region. In rural areas of the high Andean plateau, HBV infection showed an overall prevalence compatible with medium to low endemicity (11.2%), and no carriers of HCV or HDV antibodies were found. In two high-risk groups in the city of Cochabamba (homeless children and sexual workers), the prevalence of HBV infection was similar (11.6%) and could be considered low by comparison to that of similar population groups in Latin American urban centers. The prevalence of HCV (one positive case, or 0.5%) was similar to that found in similar population groups, although the small number of samples precludes drawing more definite conclusions. As has been noted previously with similar communities in tropical areas of South America, HBV infection is highly endemic in indigenous populations of the Bolivian Amazon (with an overall prevalence of 74.0%), but circulation of HCV has not been detected. It is a well-known fact that HBV is horizontally transmitted and that transmission can take place very early in life, but the mechanisms involved are unknown. By 10 years of age, more than half the population has already had the natural infection that, in approximately 10 more years will have affected virtually the entire population. The very low rate of positivity to HBsAg (1.6%), the absence of viral DNA in samples showing isolated positivity to anti-HBc, and the high prevalence of anti-HBs among individuals who show markers for natural infection (92.4%) suggest vertical transmission plays no role in persistent endemicity. So far, no outbreak of HDV infection has been documented in these communities, but the high endemicity shown by HBV points to the possibility of future outbreaks. Results obtained with tests for the detection of antibodies against HEV suggest that this virus is circulating widely in Bolivia and that it could have caused recent outbreaks in Cochabamba state. Vaccination against HBV in endemic populations is recommended as a short-term measure. Also recommended are actively searching for outbreaks and sporadic cases of hepatitis E in the entire country and performing additional research that will help in assessing the public health consequences of the situation described in this article."

Using an 87 question survey, the following data were collected from patients on cART in Botswana: demographics, performance (Karnofsky) score, perceived stigma and level of HIV disclosure, attitudes and beliefs concerning HIV/AIDS, substance and/or drug use, depression, and pharmacy and healthcare provider-related factors. Overall adherence rates were determined by patient self-report, institutional adherence, and a culturally modified Morisky scale. Three hundred adult patients were recruited between April and May 2005. The overall cART adherence rate was 81.3% based on 4 day and 1 month patient recall and on clinic attendance for ARV medication refills during the previous 3 months. Adults receiving cART for 1-6 months were the least adherent (77%) followed by those receiving cART for greater than 12 months (79%). Alcohol use, depression, and nondisclosure of positive HIV status to their partner were predictive of poor adherence rates (p value <0.02). A significant proportion (81.3%) of cART-treated adults were adherent to their prescribed treatment, with rates superior to those reported in resource-rich settings. Adherence rates were poorest among those just starting cART, most likely due to the presence of ARV-related toxicity. Adherence was lower among those who have been treated for longer periods of time (greater than 1 year), suggesting complacency, which may become a significant problem, especially among these long-term cART-treated patients who return to improved physical and mental functioning and may be less motivated to adhere to their ARV medications. Healthcare providers should encourage HIV disclosure to ""at-risk"" partners and provide ongoing counseling and education to help patients recognize and overcome HIV-associated stigma, alcohol abuse, and depression."

Overall, 4,894 inmates from 20 prisons were enrolled. To have a comparison group, prison staff were also asked to take part. Altogether, 1,553 of the 4,894 inmates from seven prisons completed a questionnaire on risk behaviors. According to the survey, 1.5%, 4.9%, and 0.04% of the prisoners were tested positive for HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HIV, respectively. These prevalence data are among the lowest reported from prisons worldwide, although comparable to the Central European data. The prevalence of HBV, HCV, and HIV in the Hungarian prison staff was low (0.38%, 0.47%, and 0%, respectively). The rate of HCV infection was significantly higher among inmates who have ever injected drugs (22.5%) than among inmates who reported they had never injected drugs (1.1%). This first prevalence study of illegal drug injection-related viral infections among Hungarian prisoners points out that ever injecting drugs is the main reason for HCV infection among inmates. The opportunity to reach drug users infected with HCV for treatment underlines the importance of screening programs for blood-borne viruses in prisons."

Unsafe injection practices were associated with increased odds of having friends who injected drugs with used syringes, injecting with friends or sexual partners, and injecting heroin. Perceived high susceptibility to HIV and perceived barriers to obtaining sterile syringes were associated with increased odds of receptive syringe sharing, but not with sharing injection paraphernalia. Over half the IDUs reported unsafe injection practices. Our results suggest that personal relationships might influence IDUs' perceptions that dictate behavior. Integrated interventions addressing individual and socio-environmental factors are needed to promote safe injection practices in this population."

We designed a trial to characterize these parameters after interruption of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients who had maintained prolonged viral suppression on antiretroviral drugs. Eighteen patients with CD4(+) T cell counts >/= 350 cells/microliter and viral load below the limits of detection for >/=1 year while on HAART were enrolled prospectively in a trial in which HAART was discontinued. Twelve of these patients had received prior IL-2 therapy and had low frequencies of resting, latently infected CD4 cells. Viral load relapse to >50 copies/ml occurred in all 18 patients independent of prior IL-2 treatment, beginning most commonly during weeks 2-3 after cessation of HAART. The mean relapse rate constant was 0.45 (0.20 log(10) copies) day(-1), which was very similar to the mean viral clearance rate constant after drug resumption of 0.35 (0.15 log(10) copies) day(-1) (P = 0.28). One patient experienced a relapse delay to week 7. All patients except one experienced a relapse burden to >5,000 RNA copies/ml. Ex vivo labeling with BrdUrd showed that CD4 and CD8 cell turnover increased after withdrawal of HAART and correlated with viral load whereas lymphocyte turnover decreased after reinitiation of drug treatment. Virologic relapse occurs rapidly in patients who discontinue suppressive drug therapy, even in patients with a markedly diminished pool of resting, latently infected CD4(+) T cells."

Existing research suggests the HIV/AIDS pandemic in resource-rich settings is increasingly concentrated among members of vulnerable and marginalized populations, including homeless/marginally-housed individuals, who have yet to benefit fully from recent advances in highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We reviewed the scientific evidence investigating the relationships between inferior housing and the health status, HAART access and adherence and HIV treatment outcomes of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA.) Studies indicate being homeless/marginally-housed is common among PLWHA and associated with poorer levels of HAART access and sub-optimal treatment outcomes. Among homeless/marginally-housed PLWHA, determinants of poorer HAART access/adherence or treatment outcomes include depression, illicit drug use, and medication insurance status. Future research should consider possible social- and structural-level determinants of HAART access and HV treatment outcomes that have been shown to increase vulnerability to HIV infection among homeless/marginally-housed individuals. As evidence indicates homeless/marginally-housed PLWHA with adequate levels of adherence can benefit from HAART at similar rates to housed PLWHA, and given the individual and community benefits of expanding HAART use, interventions to identify HIV-seropositive homeless/marginally-housed individuals, and engage them in HIV care including comprehensive support for HAART adherence are urgently needed."

The patient sample was 41.8% female and had a mean age of 34.9 years. 54 (81%) had AIDS; total sample mean baseline CD4+/viral counts were 276 cells/mm3 and 237 517 copies per millilitre, respectively. Delays between clinic request and receipt of first CD4+/viral load results ranged from 25 to 107 (mean 66) and 33 to 139 (mean 86) days, respectively. Fifty-nine patients (88.1%) were prescribed ARV treatment. Forty-two regimens (71.2%) were highly active antiretroviral therapies; 17 (28.8%) were combination regimens with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. No combinations were prescribed that were contraindicated in Brazilian guidelines, however 33 patients (55.9%) were prescribed ARV drugs before one or both HIV status parameters (initial CD4+ level or viral load) were recorded. Fourteen patients prescribed ARVs (23.7%) lacked a supply of medication for >1 month during the year at least once. Of these patients, 11 had treatment lapses as a result of failure to pick up medications, and three lacked medication because of drug shortages. Medication lapses were associated with female sex, being hospitalized in 2000, and having more than two drugs in regimen, but were not associated with age, CD4+ level or use of ARVs before 2000. The results from this pilot study suggest conservative prescription of HAART, high practitioner adherence to guidelines, and some problems with refilling medications in a timely manner. Monitoring delays were identified as a structural limitation to optimal adherence to practice guidelines. Better access to monitoring-laboratory facilities and greater drug availability would improve programme success."

Data were collected through the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS). To date, more than 1400 IDUs have been enrolled and followed, of whom 479 were aged 29 years or younger. Semiannually, participants have completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire and have undergone serologic testing for HIV and HCV. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were undertaken to investigate predictors of baseline coinfection. Cox regression models with time-dependent covariates were used to identify predictors of time to secondary infection seroconversion. A Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to determine risk associations across 3 categories: no infection, monoinfection, and coinfection. Of the 479 young injectors, 78 (16%) were coinfected with HIV and HCV at baseline and a further 45 (15%) with follow-up data became coinfected during the study period. Baseline coinfection was independently associated with being female, being aboriginal, older age, greater number of years injecting, and living in the IDU epicenter. Factors independently associated with time to secondary infection seroconversion were borrowing needles and greater than once-daily cocaine injection, and accessing methadone maintenance therapy in the previous 6 months was protective. There were clear trends across the 3 categories for increasing proportions of female subjects, aboriginal subjects, older age, greater number of years injecting, living in the IDU epicenter, and daily cocaine use. There were a shocking number of youth living with coinfection, particularly female and aboriginal youth. The median number of years injecting for youth seroconverting to a secondary infection was 3 years, suggesting that appropriate public health interventions should be implemented immediately."

The aim of this study was to measure rates of adherence to ART and factors associated with nonadherence among patients receiving care at an outpatient HIV clinic in Estonia. The study was based on cross-sectional data from a convenience sample of 144 patients receiving outpatient HIV care. Data were obtained via interviewer-administered surveys and data abstraction from clinical records. Adherence was measured from a 3-day patient self-report. Among 144 participants (mean age 33.8 years), two-thirds (63%) had been infected with HIV through intravenous drug use. Most (74%) were co-infected with hepatitis C (HCV). Perfect adherence over the last 3 days was commonly reported (88% [95% CI 81-92%]) with nonperfect adherence associated with greater concerns about the potential adverse consequences of taking ART (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.8, 95% CI 1.2-34.0) and average (versus good/very good) self-reported health status (AOR 4.7, 95% CI 1.2-31.4). Self-reported ART adherence in this sample of Estonian HIV-positive patients in clinical care was similar to rates observed in Western Europe and other developed countries. Results suggest that adherence education and support may be most helpful if they specifically target the development of positive beliefs, reduction of negative expectancies towards ART."
2148,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"In this multicenter study, we investigated the prognostic factors that influence the risk of death in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Clinical and laboratory indices obtained from 161 HIV-seropositive patients who underwent a detailed morphologic and immunophenotypic evaluation of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood cell populations were retrospectively analyzed. In 155 patients, death occurred within the 48-mo follow-up (mean follow-up: 14.8 mo; range: 1 to 48 mo). In the univariate analysis, the patient's age (> 30 yr), HIV disease status, HIV transmission category, number of opportunistic pathogens isolated from the BAL, percentage of BAL neutrophils, and low number of BAL CD4 T cells were predictive of increased mortality. In contrast, the presence of an alveolitis or an increase in the numbers of alveolar macrophages and CD3 T cells was associated with a decreased mortality. In the multivariate analysis, significant independent predictors were age, risk factor for HIV, and presence of an alveolitis. Furthermore, patients with a low number of BAL CD4 T cells had a particularly poor prognosis while the CD4 T-cell count in the peripheral blood (< 50 cells/mm3 in the majority of our patients) had a negligible effect on predicting survival. Our findings suggest the clinical utility of BAL analysis in patients infected with HIV."
8741,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"Our objective was to assess the extent and risk factors for depression and poor physical health among patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We surveyed HCV-infected patients seen at four large healthcare systems participating in the Chronic Hepatitis Cohort Study (CHeCS). Survey data included demographics, depression and physical health measures, substance use history, current social support, recent stressor exposures, and, from the electronic medical record, treatment history, and Charlson Comorbidity Index scores. There were 4,781 respondents, who were a mean of 56.7 years old, 71% White, and 57% male. Altogether, 51.4% reported past injection drug use, 33.9% were current smokers, and 17.7% had abused alcohol in the previous year. Additionally, 47.4% had been previously treated for HCV and 14.8% had a 12-week sustained viral response (SVR) following HCV therapy. Overall, 29.7% of patients met criteria for current depression and 24.6% were in poor physical health. In multivariate analyses, significant predictors of depression and poor health included: male gender (versus female, odds ratios [ORs], 0.70 and 0.81), Black race (versus white, ORs, 0.60 and 0.61), having education less than high school (versus college, ORs, 1.81 and 1.54), being employed (versus not, ORs, 0.36 and 0.25), having high life stressors (versus low, ORs, 2.44 and 1.64), having low social support (versus high, ORs=2.78 and 1.40), and having high Charlson scores (versus none, ORs=1.58 and 2.12). Achieving a 12-week SVR was found to be protective for depression."
8460,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"In order to determine the prevalence and incidence of bloodborne viral infections among prisoners, we conducted a prospective study in a Danish medium security prison for males. The prisoners were offered an interview and blood test for hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus HIV at inclusion as well as at release from prison or end of study. Of 403 prisoners available 325 (79%) participated in the initial survey and for 142 (44%) a follow-up test was available. 43% (140/325) of the participants were injecting drug users (IDUs) of whom 64% were positive for hepatitis B (HBV) and 87% for hepatitis C (HCV) markers. No cases of HIV or human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV) were found. 32% of all prisoners could transmit HBV and/or HCV by blood contact. 70% of IDUs had shared injecting equipment, and 60% had injected inside prison. Only 2% of IDUs were vaccinated against HBV. Duration of injecting drug use, numbers of imprisonments, and injecting in prison were independently and positively associated with the presence of HBV antibodies among IDUs by logistic regression analysis. The HBV incidence was 16/100 PY (95% CI: 2-56/100 PY) and the HCV incidence 25/100 PY (1-140) among injecting drug users (IDUs). We conclude that IDUs in prison have an incidence of hepatitis B and C 100 times higher than reported in the general Danish population. They should be vaccinated against hepatitis B and new initiatives to stop sharing of injecting equipment in and outside prison is urgently needed."
14567,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"Syncytial giant cell hepatitis (SGCH) among adult human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients has been rarely described. Most cases have been reported in subjects coinfected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), but its prevalence and outcome remain unknown. We performed a retrospective analysis of all cases of SGCH among 332 liver biopsies from HIV-infected patients seen at a tertiary center in Madrid, Spain, between 1984 and March 2004. Two hundred fifty specimens were obtained from HCV-coinfected patients. There were 2 cases of SGCH, leading to an observed overall prevalence of 0.6% (0.8% when considering only HCV-coinfected patients). In addition to histological changes secondary to chronic hepatitis C, the liver cords were replaced by syncytial giant cells with up to 30 nuclei. There was no histological evidence of measles (among paramyxoviruses) or herpes viruses group infections. In patient 1, there was a progressive clinical worsening after a 3-month course of prednisone, leading to liver failure and death. His postmortem liver biopsy showed more abundant giant hepatocytes accompanied with the development of a histologic pattern of severe fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. The second patient received a prolonged course of pegylated interferon-alpha-2b and ribavirin with clearance of syncytial giant hepatocytes despite HCV-RNA persistence. SGCH is a rare histological finding among HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C. Specific treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin can lead to histological resolution and biochemical improvement, even in the absence of HCV-RNA clearance."
19513,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"A new class of antiretroviral drugs is now available to the HIV provider: The CCR5 Antagonists belong to a group of entry inhibitors with a novel mechanism of action. While these antagonists do not directly interfere with any of the steps of HIV replication, they block the CCR5 receptor, one of the co-receptors HIV uses to enter its target cell. Thus CCR5 antagonists are able to prevent infection of the cell and represent a new and unique mechanism for the treatment of HIV. There is great interest in utilizing this new drug class in early treatment of HIV to prevent infection of large cell pools; CCR5 antagonists even may be useful tools in the various settings of exposure prophylaxis. Maraviroc is now approved in both the European Union and the United States for the treatment of HIV infection. This is the first medication belonging to the new class of CCR5 antagonists, and the first approval of an orally available drug in a new class since 1996. Aplaviroc, maraviroc, and vicriviroc are small molecule inhibitors of CCR5 that block HIV-1 infection in vitro and reduce plasma HIV-1 RNA in HIV infected subjects by approximately 1.5 log10 copies/mL over 10-14 days when given as single agents. Very limited data is available on the use of CCR5 antagonists in treatment naive patients due to early termination of many trials because of inferior performance or toxicity and at the time of this writing in August 2007 there is only one ongoing non-inferiority trial in the naive patient population. The 48 week interim results of this trial using twice daily maraviroc were reported at the International AIDS Society meeting in July 2007. Maraviroc compared to efavirenz was non-inferior in regards to percentage of subjects reaching viral loads below 400 copies/mL, but not so for the analysis of subjects reaching viral loads below 50 copies/mL. On the other hand maraviroc had a superior side-effect profile, fewer adverse events and a greater increase of CD4 cell count than efavirenz. These data will revitalize the interest in CCR5 antagonists as a treatment option for the treatment-naive patients. In order to be used as first line drugs, CCR5 antagonists face a number of challenges: They will have to be proven to be as potent, durable, safe, and convenient as current available options. Important questions unique to this new class will have to be answered: What are the mechanisms and risks of tropism change? What is the role and needed frequency of tropism testing, and what efficacy is seen in patients with dual-tropic/mixed infection in the long term? Clearly until we have answers to these questions CCR5 antagonists should be reserved for the treatment-experienced patient population with limited treatment options."
13521,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors are important components of highly active antiretroviral therapy and have had a profound impact on the natural history of HIV and AIDS. However, in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), drug-induced hepatotoxicity or liver injury has emerged as an important potential complication of combination antiretroviral therapy, particularly those regimens containing protease inhibitors (PIs). Liver injury has been associated each of the six PIs currently approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), most commonly with administration of full dose ritonavir (600 mg bid or 400 mg bid with saquinavir). However, this regimen has been largely replaced by the use of low-dose ritonavir (</= 200 mg bid) to pharmacologically ""boost"" other PI, such as lopinavir or indinavir, which has not been associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity compared with other PIs. Coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and B virus (HBV) remains an important risk factor for the development of HAART-associated liver injury. Although studies indicate that coinfected patients can be safely treated with PIs, such patients should be closely monitored. In addition, although unsubstantiated, some experts recommend evaluation or treatment, or both, of underlying chronic viral hepatitis prior to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Further research is needed to understand the etiopathogenesis of PI-associated liver injury, particularly among patients with hepatitis B or C infection."
18170,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"BACKGROUND. Initiatives to improve early detection and access to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) services have increased over time. We assessed the immune status of patients at initial presentation for HIV care from 1997 to 2007 in 13 US and Canadian clinical cohorts. METHODS. We analyzed data from 44,491 HIV-infected patients enrolled in the North American-AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design. We identified first presentation for HIV care as the time of first CD4(+) T lymphocyte (CD4) count and excluded patients who prior to this date had HIV RNA measurements, evidence of antiretroviral exposure, or a history of AIDS-defining illness. Trends in mean CD4 count (measured as cells/mm(3)) and 95% confidence intervals were determined using linear regression adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, HIV transmission risk, and cohort. RESULTS. Median age at first presentation for HIV care increased over time (range, 40-43 years; P < .01), whereas the percentage of patients with injection drug use HIV transmission risk decreased (from 26% to 14%; P < .01) and heterosexual transmission risk increased (from 16% to 23%; P < .01). Median CD4 count at presentation increased from 256 cells/mm(3) (interquartile range, 96-455 cells/mm(3)) to 317 cells/mm(3) (interquartile range, 135-517 cells/mm(3)) from 1997 to 2007 (P < .01). The percentage of patients with a CD4 count > or = 350 cells/mm(3) at first presentation also increased from 1997 to 2007 (from 38% to 46%; P < .01). The estimated adjusted mean CD4 count increased at a rate of 6 cells/mm(3) per year (95% confidence interval, 5-7 cells/mm(3) per year). CONCLUSION. CD4 count at first presentation for HIV care has increased annually over the past 11 years but has remained <350 cells/mm(3), which suggests the urgent need for earlier HIV diagnosis and treatment."
1600,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"(1) There is still no cure for HIV infection. The short-term treatment aims are to drive viral load below the current detection limit and to increase the CD4+ T cell count, in order to reduce morbidity and prolong survival. (2) Early initiation of treatment has both advantages and disadvantages. If the patient is symptomatic or if the CD4+ T cell count is below 200 per mm3, antiretroviral treatment should be started immediately. If the patient is asymptomatic, the CD4+ T cell count is above 350 per mm3, and viral load is below 50 000 copies/ml, antiretroviral treatment can often be deferred. Other situations should be considered case by case. (3) The benefits of treating symptomatic primary infection have not been adequately documented, and current recommendations diverge. (4) The advent of new antiretroviral drugs has increased the choice, but cross-resistance often limits treatment options. The new antiretroviral family to have emerged since 1999 is the fusion inhibitor; the only representative of this class, enfuvirtide, is reserved for patients with multiple treatment failure. (5) There is broad agreement on the principles of first-line antiretroviral treatment. It should combine at least two nucleoside (or nucleotide) inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase and one non nucleoside inhibitor, or at least one HIV protease inhibitor. Comparative studies have now identified the most effective combinations in terms of virological efficacy and tolerability. The combination should be chosen according to its established efficacy, adverse effects, risks of interactions, and convenience. There is no reference combination suitable for all patients. Among the combinations containing a non nucleoside inhibitor, those based on efavirenz are the most effective after 48 weeks of follow-up. There is less agreement on the optimal treatment of pregnant women. (6) Among the HIV protease inhibitor-based combinations, those containing nelfinavir or the lopinavir + ritonavir combination must be taken during meals. The lopinavir + ritonavir combination showed better virological efficacy than nelfinavir in a comparative trial. Experience and safety evaluation are in favour of nelfinavir, but recent American guidelines issued in November 2003 recommend the lopinavir + ritonavir combination. (7) There is no major difference in virological efficacy between non nucleoside inhibitors and protease inhibitors as first line therapy. (8) In combination with protease inhibitors or non nucleoside inhibitors, the best-assessed nucleoside inhibitors (effective for several years) are lamivudine + zidovudine and lamivudine + stavudine. For first-line treatment, combinations consisting of only three nucleoside (or nucleotide) inhibitors are less effective than combinations containing HIV protease inhibitors or non nucleoside inhibitors. (9) Efficacy is monitored on the basis of changes in viral load and the CD4+ T cell count, one month after the beginning of treatment, then about every three months. Attention must be paid to adverse effects, which may necessitate the replacement of the causative antiviral drug, treatment of the adverse effect, treatment modification or, in extreme cases, treatment withdrawal. (10) Treatment failures must be carefully investigated: the cause(s) may include poor adherence, drug interactions, and inadequate plasma drug concentrations. Ongoing antiretroviral regimens do not always have to be modified if treatment failure occurs. (11) Resistance tests can help to determine the most effective alternative in case of virological failure due to drug resistance. The choice of back-up treatments is complex, and is limited by cross-resistance. Multiple lines of treatment fail in about 3% to 4% of patients."

Longitudinal mortality data among PLWH in Indonesia are limited. We conducted a retrospective cohort study from medical records of antiretroviral treatment (ART) recipients attending Badung General Hospital (BGH) and Bali Medica Clinic (BMC) between 2006 and 2014. We explored incidence of mortality by Kaplan-Meier analysis and identified predictors using a Cox proportional hazard model. In total, 575 patients were included in the analysis; the majority were male. The overall mortality rate was 10% per year. Multivariate analysis suggested that being male (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 2.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.34-5.59), having a lower education (aHR: 2.17; 95%CI: 1.31-3.61), having heterosexual (aHR: 7.40; 95% CI: 2.61-21.00) or injecting drug use (aHR: 13.20; 95% CI: 3.17-55.00) as the likely transmission risk category, starting treatment with low CD4 cell counts (aHR: 3.18; 95% CI: 1.16-8.69), and not having a treatment supervisor (aHR: 4.02; 95% CI: 2.44-6.65) were independent predictors of mortality. The mortality was high, particularly in the first three months after initiating ART. These findings highlight the need to encourage HIV testing and early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Applying aspects of BMCs targeted HIV services model in more generalised services such as BGH may be beneficial. Providing adherence support as part of ART services is key to promoting adherence to ART."

This study aimed to determine treatment outcomes among HIV-infected patients who had cryptococcal meningitis and to determine predictors of death. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among HIV-infected patients receiving care at Chiang Mai University Hospital from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2010. We studied 79 patients; 45 (57.0%) were male and the mean age was 35.1 +/- 7.2 years. Eleven patients (13.9%) had previous opportunistic infection. The most common presenting symptoms were headache (63 patients, 79.8%), fever (49 patients, 62.0%), and altered consciousness (21 patients, 26.6%). The median CD4+ cell count was 20 cells/mm3 [Interquartile range (IQR) 10, 53]. The in-hospital, 90-day, and 1-year mortality rates were 24.1%, 32.4%, and 52.2%, respectively. The CM attributable in-hospital, 90-day and 1-year mortality rates were 13.9%, 20.3%, and 23.2%, respectively. Predictors associated with a 1-year mortality were a high cerebrospinal (CSF) cryptococcal antigen titer (> 1:10,000) [Odds Ratio (OR) =7.08, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.62-31.00, p = 0.009], and altered consciousness at presentation (OR = 5.27; 95% CI: 1.16-24.05; p = 0.032). Cryptococcal meningitis is an important cause of death in HIV-infected patients. HIV-infected patients with a low CD4+ cell count, a headache, fever and altered consciousness should be investigated for CM and those with a high CSF cryptococcal antigen titer are at high risk for mortality."
2643,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"The authors conducted a voluntary serosurvey and educational campaign among 3394 undergraduate students attending the University of Maryland at College Park to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Two students were seropositive (0.06%, 95% confidence interval 0-0.15%). Both were homosexual men with multiple sexual partners. Despite the low prevalence of infection, potential risk factors for transmission of HIV-1 were common, as assessed by a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. These included a previous sexually transmitted disease (12.6%), male homosexual intercourse (4.8% of men), heterosexual anal intercourse (25.3%), heterosexual intercourse with a person at risk (an HIV-1 infected person, a bisexual man, a parenteral drug user, a female prostitute, or a hemophiliac) (5.2%), multiple sexual partners (21% reported 10 or more lifetime partners), and intravenous drug use (1.3%). Assessment of the efficacy of our program by comparing responses on pre- and post-test questionnaires showed gains in knowledge about heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 and an increase in the reported frequency of condom use 1-2 months after participating in the survey. The authors conclude that HIV-1 infections are occurring among college students but in our study group remain confined to persons with known high-risk behavior; however, practices that may support transmission are common, and programs designed to diminish these behaviors among college students are needed."
17901,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"We investigated risk factors for unfavorable virologic responses among HIV-infected patients who recently switched antiretroviral regimens. We identified HIV-infected patients who switched antiretroviral regimens (defined as adding ≥2 new medications) between 2001 and 2008 at Kaiser Permanente California. Virological response, measured after 6 months on the new regimen, was classified as (1) maximal viral suppression (HIV RNA <75/ml), (2) low-level viremia (LLV; 75-5000/ml), or (3) advanced virologic failure (>5000/ml). Potential risk factors examined included (1) HIV disease factors, e.g., prior AIDS, CD4 cell count; (2) history of antiretroviral use, e.g., therapy classes of the newly switched regimen, medication adherence, and virologic failure at previous regimens; and (3) novel patient-level factors including comorbidities and healthcare utilization. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for LLV and advanced virologic failure were obtained from multivariable nominal logistic regression models. A total of 3447 patients were included; 2608 (76%) achieved maximal viral suppression, 420 (12%) had LLV, and 419 (12%) developed advanced virologic failure. Factors positively associated with LLV and advanced virologic failure included number of regimens prior to switch [aOR(per regimen)=1.38 (1.17-1.62) and 1.77 (1.50-2.08), respectively], nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor-only regimens (vs. protease inhibitor-based) [aOR=2.78 (1.28-6.04) and 5.10 (2.38-10.90), respectively], and virologic failure at previous regimens [aOR=3.15 (2.17-4.57) and 4.71 (2.84-7.81), respectively]. Older age, higher CD4 cell count, and medication adherence were protective for unfavorable virologic outcomes. Antiretroviral regimen-level factors and immunodeficiency were significantly associated with virologic failure after a recent therapy switch and should be considered when making treatment change decisions."
18679,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"We evaluated the prevalence of menstrual disorders in HIV-1-infected women and explored the association between such disorders and adherence to antiretroviral therapy, sexual functioning, and depressive symptoms in a group of HIV-1-infected women aged younger than 46 years and on antiretroviral therapy. Participants were included in a cross-sectional survey between June 2005 and December 2006. Women provided information about their menstrual cycle and adherence in a single visit and responded to the Greene Climacteric Scale, the Massachusetts General Hospital Sexual Functioning Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory. Women with and without menstrual disorders were compared using parametric and nonparametric tests. A multivariate stepwise logistic regression model was developed. The participants were 107 Caucasian women with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 39 years (IQR, 36-42 years) and a median CD4 cell count of 483 cells/mm(3) (IQR, 332-679 cells/mm(3)). The viral load was below 50 copies per milliliter in 76.6% of the women. Sixty-four percent of the women had acquired HIV-1 infection through sexual intercourse. Menstrual disorders, observed in 32% of participants, were more frequent in women with detectable viral loads (p = 0.018). Women with menstrual disorders reported worse adherence (p = 0.005) and more sexual dysfunction (p < 0.05). Sixty-nine percent of the women who attributed their menstrual disorders to the use of antiretrovirals had inadequate adherence. Depressive symptoms were not observed. Vasomotor symptoms (p = 0.004), having a detectable viral load (p = 0.03) and adherence less than 95% (p = 0.02) were predictors of menstrual disorder. A third of the HIV-1-infected women assessed had menstrual disorders that impacted negatively on adherence to therapy and sexual function. The subjective attribution of these irregularities to antiretrovirals seems to affect medication intake, possibly favoring negative clinical consequences."
18688,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"In this study we analyzed the influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the course of chronic hepatitis C through multivariate analysis including age, alcohol consumption, immune status, and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related virologic factors. Eighty HIV-positive and 80 HIV-negative injection drug users included between 1980 and 1995 were matched according to age, gender, and duration of HCV infection and followed-up during 52 months. The progression to cirrhosis was the primary outcome measure. The impact of HIV on HCV-RNA load, histologic activity index, response to interferon therapy, and liver-related death was also considered. In HIV-positive patients, chronic hepatitis C was characterized by higher serum HCV-RNA levels (P =.012), higher total Knodell score (P =.011), and poorer sustained response to interferon therapy (P =.009). High serum HCV-RNA level was associated with low CD4-lymphocyte count (P =.001). Necroinflamatory score was higher in HIV-positive patients (P =.023) independently of the CD4-lymphocyte count, whereas increased fibrosis was related to decreased CD4-lymphocyte count (P =.011). The progression to cirrhosis was accelerated in HIV-positive patients with low CD4 cell count (RR = 4.06, P =.024) and in interferon-untreated patients (RR = 4.76, P =.001), independently of age at HCV infection (P =.001). Cirrhosis caused death in 5 HIV-positive patients. The risk of death related to cirrhosis was increased in heavy drinkers (RR = 10.8, P =.001) and in HIV-positive patients with CD4 cell count less than 200/mm(3) (RR = 11.9, P =.007). In this retrospective cohort study, HIV coinfection worsened the outcome of chronic hepatitis C, increasing both serum HCV-RNA level and liver damage and decreasing sustained response to interferon therapy. Age and alcohol were cofactors associated with cirrhosis and mortality. Interferon therapy had a protective effect against HCV-related cirrhosis no matter what the patient's HIV status was."
15537,0.005,3.0000,"Even with advances in the medical management of HIV/AIDS, it remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Network members are a source of support and may be designated as the patient's surrogate therapeutic decision maker. However, little is known about the role of caregivers regarding highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and adherence to medication, especially among low income and medically underserved HIV-infected individuals. The objective of this analysis was to explore patients and their caregivers' understanding, insight, and perceptions of HAART. This was a qualitative study conducted in an urban teaching hospital in the Bronx, NY, consisting of 144 adults with advanced HIV/AIDS and their informal/familial caregivers. Patients and caregivers completed in-depth interviews and brief questionnaires. The data were analyzed using standard qualitative techniques. Themes related to HAART efficacy, side effects, and adherence were identified in the discussions with both patients and their care providers. Looking for consistencies and discordant reports of patients-caregivers dyadic experience with HAART and their association with healthcare sentiment, it was found that the accounts of both members of the dyad were more likely to reflect positive feelings about the patient's healthcare experience when they shared perceptions about the treatment, and were more likely to have a negative viewpoint when the dyad was discordant about treatment. These findings support the importance for HIV healthcare providers to include both patients and their caregivers in discussions about HAART, in order to improve their understanding of and satisfaction with the medication, and, to ultimately contribute to patients' adherence. The study also suggests that healthcare teams may enhance dialog with patients and caregivers to create therapeutic decisions to accommodate the priorities and values of the patient and their family. Clinical, educational, and evaluating tools need to be further developed and evaluation to facilitate this process."
15083,0.005,3.0000,"Transmission of HIV-1 drug resistance has important clinical and epidemiological consequences including earlier treatment failure and forward transmission of resistance strains in high-risk groups. To evaluate the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of transmitted drug resistance in Rhode Island, we collected genotypic, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from treatment-naive individuals presenting to the largest outpatient HIV clinic in the state from January 2007 to November 2007. Sequences from 35 treatment-naive individuals were available, 83% of whom were men who had sex with men (MSM). All sequences were HIV-1 subtype B. Drug resistance mutations were identified in 7/35 [20%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.08-0.37] patients, six of whom had K103N. Two phylogenetic transmission clusters were found, involving 17% (6/35) of individuals, three in each cluster. We did not find an association between belonging to a cluster and age, gender, AIDS-defining illness, CD4 cell count, or viral load. Drug resistance mutations were more commonly observed in transmission clusters (p = 0.08). Individuals in one cluster all had K103N and were MSM who had attended local bathhouses. Individuals forming clusters were significantly more likely to have visited a bathhouse compared to nonclusters (p = 0.02). The prevalence of transmitted drug resistance in Rhode Island is high, further justifying genotypic testing on presentation to care and prior to treatment initiation. Molecular epidemiological analysis and association of resistance with phylogenetic networks using data obtained for clinical purposes may serve as useful tools for the prevention of drug resistance transmission and for contact tracing."
17650,0.005,3.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is transmitted by injection drug use and associated with psychiatric conditions. Patients with drug use or significant psychiatric illness have typically been excluded from HCV treatment trials noting the 1997 National Institutes of Health Consensus Statement on HCV that indicated active drug use and major depressive illness were contraindications to treatment of HCV infection. However, the 2002 NIH Consensus Statement recognized that these patients could be effectively treated for HCV infection and recommended that treatment be considered on a case-by-case basis. Treating HCV infection in these patients is challenging, with drug use relapse possibly leading to psychosocial instability, poor adherence, and HCV reinfection. Interferon therapy may exacerbate preexisting psychiatric symptoms. Co-occurring human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis B virus provide additional challenges, and access to ancillary medical and psychiatric services may be limited. Patients with co-occurring HCV infection, substance use, and psychiatric illness can complete interferon treatment with careful monitoring and aggressive intervention. Clinicians must integrate early interventions for psychiatric conditions and drug use into their treatment algorithm. Few programs or treatment models are designed to manage co-occurring substance use, psychiatric illness, and HCV infection and therapy. The National Institute on Drug Abuse convened a panel of experts to address the current status and the long-range needs through a 2-day workshop, Co-occurring Hepatitis C, Substance Abuse, and Psychiatric Illness: Addressing the Issues and Developing Integrated Models of Care. This conference report summarizes current data, medical management issues, and strategies discussed."
8066,0.005,3.0000,"Recent studies have evaluated cumulative human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral load (cVL) for predicting disease outcomes, with discrepant results. We reviewed the disparate methodological approaches taken and evaluated the prognostic utility of cVL in a resource-limited setting. Using data on the Infectious Diseases Institute (Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda) cohort, who initiated antiretroviral therapy in 2004-2005 and were followed up for 9 years, we calculated patients' time-updated cVL by summing the area under their viral load curves on either a linear scale (cVL1) or a logarithmic scale (cVL2). Using Cox proportional hazards models, we evaluated both metrics as predictors of incident opportunistic infections and mortality. Among 489 patients analyzed, neither cVL measure was a statistically significant predictor of opportunistic infection risk. In contrast, cVL2 (but not cVL1) was a statistically significant predictor of mortality, with each log10 increase corresponding to a 1.63-fold (95% confidence interval: 1.02, 2.60) elevation in mortality risk when cVL2 was accumulated from baseline. However, whether cVL is predictive or not hinges on difficult choices surrounding the cVL metric and statistical model employed. Previous studies may have suffered from confounding bias due to their focus on cVL1, which strongly correlates with other variables. Further methodological development is needed to illuminate whether the inconsistent predictive utility of cVL arises from causal relationships or from statistical artifacts."
2756,0.005,3.0000,"The potential impact of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) on clinical, immunological and virological responses to initial highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is important to evaluate due to the high prevalence of HIV-HCV coinfection. A historical cohort study was conducted among 824 HIV-infected patients starting HAART at a public referral service in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to assess the impact of HCV seropositivity on appearance of a new AIDS-defining opportunistic illness, AIDS-related death, suppression of viral load, and an increase in CD4-cell count. A total of 76 patients (9.2%) had a positive HCV test, 26 of whom (34.2%) had a history of intravenous drug use. In multivariate analysis, HCV seropositivity was associated with a smaller CD4-cell recovery (RH=0.68; 95% CI [0.49-0.92], but not with progression to a new AIDS-defining opportunistic illness or to AIDS-related death (RH=1.08; 95% CI [0.66-1.77]), nor to suppression of HIV-1 viral load (RH=0.81; 95% CI [0.56-1.17]) after starting HAART. These results indicate that although associated with a blunted CD4-cell recovery, HCV coinfection did not affect the morbidity or mortality related to AIDS or the virological response to initial HAART."
1348,0.005,3.0000,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with increased levels of peripheral T cell apoptosis. We aimed to study whether T cell apoptosis markers indicate pathways that may contribute to clinical progression in HCV monoinfected and HIV-HCV coinfected patients. Activation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathways was measured by levels of death receptor Fas, initiator caspase 8 and effector caspases 3 and 7 activity and Annexin V binding on peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells of HCV monoinfected and HIV/HCV coinfected patients, as well as healthy controls and HIV-infected, hepatitis B virus-infected and primary biliary cirrhosis disease controls. Association with liver fibrosis was assessed by biopsy or by transient elastography. HCV monoinfected and HIV-HCV coinfected patients displayed enhanced peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cell apoptosis. Caspase 8 activity was highest in HIV-HCV coinfection, without enhanced downstream activity of caspases 3 and 7. Level of peripheral T cell apoptosis was independent of liver fibrosis or other disease parameters in all disease groups. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway is upregulated in HCV monoinfection and HIV-HCV coinfection, but this is independent of liver disease severity. "
15405,0.005,3.0000,"We have conducted an open, prospective trial to assess the safety and efficacy of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin in combination for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected hemophiliacs. Twenty hemophiliacs coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), 18 of them under highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), with a mean CD4(+) cell count of 490 +/- 176 cells/mm(3) and undetectable (n = 9) or low-level HIV RNA (<10,000 copies/mL; n = 11), were treated with interferon-alfa2b (3 MU thrice weekly) and ribavirin (800 mg/d) for 6 or 12 months according to virologic response. Patients were monitored for tolerance and response at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks during treatment and every other month thereafter. All 20 patients enrolled completed at least 6 months of treatment with no major side effect requiring treatment withdrawal, dose reduction, or modification of HAART. Overall, 8 patients (40%) achieved a sustained virologic response at the end of the 6-month post-treatment follow-up. Sustained responders had lower baseline HCV-RNA levels (5.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 6.3 +/- 0.4 log10 IU/mL, P =.041) but were otherwise similar to nonresponders. All sustained responders had a decrease in HCV-RNA level of at least 1 log per month during the first 2 months and undetectable levels at 6 months. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin is safe in HIV-infected hemophiliacs with stable CD4 cell count and undetectable or low-level HIV replication, and leads to eradication of HCV in 40% of these patients."
8745,0.005,3.0000,"This study assessed health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) recipients aged 18 or older and associated factors, 2 years after HAART administration had started in Kagera, Tanzania. Using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), 329 HAART recipients were interviewed in May 2007. Questions on sociodemographic characteristics, chronic diseases (besides HIV/AIDS), HAART side effects and adherence to antiretroviral drugs were added. Treatment data, the first and latest available CD4 counts were retrieved from patients' records. Gender and age-adjusted mean scale scores of the sample were compared to those of the general Tanzanian population of the late 1990 s using t test. Logistic regression was used to explore the effect of sex, age, education level, income, chronic diseases, CD4 count, HAART side effects and adherence to antiretroviral drugs on recipients' physical functioning and mental health scale scores. The mean scale scores of HAART recipients were generally lower than those of the general population except for general health perceptions (p = 0.191) and mental health (p = 0.161). HAART recipients with chronic disease comorbidity were more likely to score below the general population's mean score for mental health (p = 0.007). While the effect of chronic disease comorbidity on physical functioning among those who recorded a CD4 count increase was negative (odds ratio [OR] = 13.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.7, 49.9), there was no effect on those who did not have such an increase. The control of chronic diseases among recipients should be given priority to improve their HRQOL."
15803,0.005,3.0000,"Although reported rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and related risk behaviours among drug injectors vary considerably throughout the world, and comparison of findings is often hampered by methodological variability among centres. In 1989 the World Health Organization initiated a comparative study of current drug-injecting behaviour and HIV infection using a standardized methodology. Centres were asked to recruit at least half of their samples outside drug treatment settings in order to achieve as representative a group of injectors as possible. Respondents were interviewed using a questionnaire designed by an international working group, and they were asked to provide blood and/or saliva specimens for voluntary testing. Data from 13 centres (Athens, Bangkok, Berlin, Glasgow, London, Madrid, Naples, New York, Rome, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Sydney and Toronto) are reported here. A total of 6,390 injectors were recruited to the study from October 1989 to March 1992, with sample sizes ranging from 85 at Santos (Brazil) to 1,300 in New York. Weekly or daily sharing of injecting equipment was reported by less than a quarter of injectors in all centres. A high proportion of those sharing made some effort to clean equipment before use, although not always by efficient methods. In all centres, the majority of respondents were sexually active; however, rates of unprotected sexual intercourse were high, particularly between regular sexual partners. The overall HIV prevalence rate was 22 per cent, ranging from 0 per cent in Athens to 60 per cent in Santos. Caution should be exercised in postulating a link between HIV prevalence and current risk behaviour, particularly since injectors appear to behave in similar ways across a diverse range of study locations. This is the first report on an international collaborative study for which a large number of injectors were successfully recruited from a variety of settings. The wealth of data now available provides a greater understanding of the social epidemiology of drug injecting, which is essential for the implementation and evaluation of campaigns and interventions designed to limit the spread of HIV infection."
2664,0.005,3.0000,"While numerous studies examine methamphetamine use and associated risky sexual behaviors in HIV-uninfected individuals, few studies have surveyed HIV-infected individuals in the health care setting. To assess the frequency and trends of methamphetamine use, sexual activity, injection drug use, patient-provider communication, and medication adherence among HIV-infected persons in care, we administered a one-page anonymous survey in 2004 and 2006. The survey was conducted at the two University of California, San Francisco outpatient HIV clinics: at Moffitt Hospital (Moffitt), serving primarily privately insured patients, and at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), a county hospital serving primarily patients who are uninsured or publicly insured. In 2006, 39% of men who have sex with men (MSM), 33% of heterosexual men, and 11% of women reported methamphetamine use in the prior 12 months. Methamphetamine use was significantly associated with an increased number of sex partners among MSM and heterosexual men, and poor anti-retroviral medication adherence. Among MSM, methamphetamine use was more common at the SFGH clinic. Between 2004 and 2006, reported methamphetamine use in the last 12 months decreased among MSM at Moffitt (38 to 20%, p<0.01), but increased at SFGH (40 to 50%, p<0.05). Among methamphetamine users we found a high frequency of injection of methamphetamine, which increased at SFGH from 38 to 55%, p<0.05. Patient-provider communication regarding methamphetamine use has increased from 2004 to 2006 but no significant change has been found for providers asking patients about sexual activity. Overall, we found methamphetamine use to be common among HIV-infected patients in care, and associated with an increased number of sex partners, a high frequency of injection drug use, and poor adherence to anti-retroviral medications. These findings support the need for improved screening and clinic-based interventions to reduce and treat methamphetamine abuse and associated high risk sexual behaviors."
10192,0.005,3.0000,"Puerto Rico (PR) has a large and rapidly growing population of people living with HIV. However, relatively little behavioral or clinical research has been done in this population. As treatment for HIV increasingly moves into a chronic condition model, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the needs of this population so critical social and behavioral interventions can be developed, thus enabling the individual and community-level benefits of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment to be fully realized. To date, however, there has been very little research on the mental health needs of people living with HIV in PR, a fact that constrains intervention development and implementation. This paper describes data from a public sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV clinic study in the San Juan metropolitan area between April 2010 and December 2012 (n = 1185), roughly a third (36%) of whom are living with HIV. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, t-tests, and binary logistic regressions were used to assess associations between HIV status and a history of suicide attempt. The overall prevalence of a history of suicide attempt was 20.4%. No statistically significant relationship was found between a history of suicide attempt and being HIV positive, although people with HIV infection did evidence a higher prevalence of attempts than HIV-negative subjects (23.4% vs. 19.0%). Factors associated with having a history of suicide attempt within the overall sample included gender, current employment status, a lifetime history of drug use, and a lifetime history of sex work. Similar patterns were seen in the HIV-positive subsample. There was a nonsignificant trend toward increased risk for a post-diagnosis suicide attempt. These findings suggest that additional research on mental health risks among populations at risk for HIV in PR is needed."
13936,0.005,3.0000,"According to the World Health Organization, half of the 14 million people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide were infected between the ages of 15 and 24 years. However, details about HIV-positive (HIV+) youths' risk-related behavior and social context have not been previously reported. OBJECTIVES. To outline detailed sexual and drug use practices, social and psychological status of HIV+ youth compared with a cohort of HIV-negative (HIV-) youth; and to examine the ability of the health belief and risk-taking models to predict sexual and drug use acts of HIV+ youth. METHODS. HIV testing was conducted on and a 207-item structured interview covering HIV risk-related acts, protective factors and background information was administered to 72 HIV+ and 1142 HIV- adolescents aged 13 through 21 years receiving care in an adolescent clinical care unit of a large medical center in New York City. Data were analyzed for adolescents reporting sexual intercourse (71 HIV+ and 722 HIV-) by logistic regression analysis of five domains to identify variables significantly associated with HIV seropositivity. RESULTS. Logistic regressions indicated significant differences in sexual risk acts based on serostatus and gender. Anonymous, blinded seroprevalence testing identified 11% more HIV+ adolescents than would have been identified by current counseling and testing practices. HIV+ adolescents were significantly more likely to be sexually abused (33 vs 21%, P < .05), engage in anal sex and survival sex (32 vs 4%, P < .01), unprotected sex with casual partners (42 vs 23%, P < .05), have had sex under the influence of drugs (52 vs 27%, P < .01), have a sexually transmitted disease (59 vs 28%, P < .01), use multiple drugs (43 vs 9%, P < .01) and engage in multiple problem behaviors (72 vs 30%, P < .01) than HIV- young people. HIV+ females reported more oral (69 vs 45%, P < .01) and/or anal (42 vs 12%, P < .01) intercourse compared to HIV- females. HIV+ males reported significantly higher rates of both insertive (82 vs 46%, P < .05) and receptive (51 vs 4%, P < .01) oral and anal (53 vs 13%, P < .01) intercourse than HIV- males. Protective factors were not significantly different for HIV+ and HIV- young people. CONCLUSIONS. Routine, confidential HIV counseling and testing should be considered for adolescents having unprotected sexual intercourse when age-specific services are available for HIV+ youth. Prevention programs should consider adolescents' history of abuse, homelessness, and other social as well as psychological dimensions in designing comprehensive care strategies to address HIV+ adolescents' multiple problem behaviors and living situations. Current theoretical models of health behaviors should be reconsidered, given the lack of their association to HIV risk acts of HIV+ youth. Age-specific services and interventions for HIV+ youth are urgently needed as HIV is spreading among youth worldwide."
14100,0.005,3.0000,"Non-adherence to safer sex and non-adherence to ART can each have adverse health consequences for HIV-infected individuals and their sex partners, but little is known about the association of these behaviors with each other. This ""dual risk"" has potential negative public health consequences since non-adherence can lead to the development of resistant virus that can then be transmitted to sex partners. Among participants in the Multi-site Adherence Collaboration in HIV we examined, at study baseline, the association between the frequency of unprotected sex (assessed by self-report) and ART adherence (assessed by Medication Event Monitoring System, Aardex) among the sexually active participants in the five studies (N = 459) that collected sexual risk behavior. The bivariate association between sexual risk behaviors and ART adherence was assessed by Pearson correlations; subsequently regression analyses were used to evaluate the role of demographic characteristics, depression and substance use in explaining the ""dual risk"" outcome (sexual risk and non-adherence). Among participants who had been sexually active, more unprotected anal/vaginal sex was weakly associated with poorer ART adherence (r = -0.12, p = 0.01 for the overall sample). Further analysis showed this association was driven by the heterosexual men in the sample (r = -0.29, p < 0.001), and was significant only for this group, and not for gay/bisexual men or for women (heterosexual and homosexual). Neither substance use nor depression accounted for the association between sexual risk and ART adherence. HIV-infected heterosexual men who are having difficulty adhering to ART are also more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors and therefore may benefit from counseling about these risk behaviors. We must identify procedures to screen for these risk behaviors and develop interventions, appropriately tailored to specific populations and identified risk factors, that can be integrated into routine clinical care for people living with HIV. This will become increasingly important in the context of wider access to treatment globally, including new recommendations for ART initiation earlier in a patients' disease course (e.g., ""Test and Treat"" paradigms)."
17696,0.005,3.0000,"Two-thirds of the world's HIV-infected people live in sub-Saharan Africa, and more than 1.5 million of them die annually. As access to antiretroviral treatment has expanded within the region; early pessimism concerning the delivery of antiretroviral treatment using a large-scale public health approach has, at least in the short term, proved to be broadly unfounded. Immunological and virological responses to ART are similar to responses in patients treated in high-income countries. Despite this, however, early mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa are very high; between 8 and 26% of patients die in the first year of antiretroviral treatment, with most deaths occurring in the first few months. Patients typically access antiretroviral treatment with advanced symptomatic disease, and mortality is strongly associated with baseline CD4 cell count less than 50 cells/mul and WHO stage 4 disease (AIDS). Although data are limited, leading causes of death appear to be tuberculosis, acute sepsis, cryptococcal meningitis, malignancy and wasting syndrome. Mortality rates are likely to depend not only on the care delivered by antiretroviral treatment programmes, but more fundamentally on how advanced disease is at programme enrollment and the quality of preceding healthcare. In addition to improving delivery of antiretroviral treatment and providing it free of charge to the patient, strategies to reduce mortality must include earlier diagnosis of HIV infection, strengthening of longitudinal HIV care and timely initiation of antiretroviral treatment. Health systems delays in antiretroviral treatment initiation must be minimized, especially in patients who present with advanced immunodeficiency."
4921,0.005,3.0000,"The association of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) was assessed among men who have sex with men (MSM) in a nested case-control study of 116 case subjects who seroconverted to HIV during follow-up and 342 control subjects who remained HIV seronegative, frequency-matched by follow-up duration and report of HIV-infected sex partner and unprotected anal sex. The baseline HSV-2 seroprevalence was higher among case (46%) than control (34%) subjects (P=.03); the HSV-2 seroincidence was 7% versus 4% (P=.3). Only 15% of HSV-2-infected MSM reported herpes outbreaks in the past year. HIV acquisition was associated with prior HSV-2 infection (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.9), reporting >12 sex partners (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.4-6.3), and reporting fewer herpes outbreaks in the past year (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.8). HSV-2 increases the risk of HIV acquisition, independent of recognized herpes lesions and behaviors reflecting potential HIV exposure. HSV-2 suppression with antiviral therapy should be evaluated as an HIV prevention strategy among MSM."
17631,0.005,3.0000,"The natural history of anemia related to interferon/ribavirin (IFN/RBV) treatment in patients with human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus (HIV/HCV) coinfection is not completely understood. The current 8-week, multicenter, observational study characterized anemia over the course of HCV treatment in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection. Eligible HIV/HCV coinfected patients were receiving care in community-based and academic institutions and were on stable antiretroviral therapy and initiating IFN/RBV therapy. Hb, sEPO, reticulocytes, transfusions, laboratory values (e.g., total bilirubin), and IFN and RBV dosages were monitored weekly. Ninety-one patients were analyzed (mean age, 46 years; 71% on HAART) and 53 patients completed the study. Mean Hb decreased significantly (5.0 g/dl) within 1 week of initiating IFN/RBV therapy (p = 0.0002); Hb nadir occurred at a median of 37 days. Maximum Hb decreases of > or =2.0 g/dl occurred in 56 (62%) patients and > or =3.0 g/dl occurred in 45 (49%) patients. Reticulocyte count increased within the first 2 weeks and sEPO peaked at week 3. Mean increase from baseline to week 2 in reticulocyte count and sEPO, respectively, was 1.3% (n = 74) and 45.0 mIU/ml (n = 80) (p < 0.0001 for each parameter), and from baseline to week 8 was 0.9% (n = 48) and 41.0 mIU/ml (n = 52) (p < or = 0.0001 for each parameter). Adverse events (AEs) were the most common reason for study discontinuation (66% of discontinuing patients). Among the 25 patients who discontinued due to AEs, 84% discontinued due to anemia (n = 21). Significant decreases in Hb were observed in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients within 1 week of initiating IFN/RBV therapy. sEPO and reticulocyte increases were blunted in response to anemia; Hb levels did not return to baseline values and anemia was a frequent reason for discontinuing the study."
14271,0.005,3.0000,"BACKGROUND Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the United States (US). Although most cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are secondary to bacterial infection, up to one-third of cases are secondary to viral infection, most commonly due to rhinovirus and influenza virus. Pneumonia due to herpes simplex virus (HSV) is rare, and there is limited knowledge of the pathogenesis and clinical complications. This report is of a fatal case of HSV pneumonia associated with bilateral pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. CASE REPORT A 36-year-old homeless male Hispanic patient, who was a chronic smoker, with a history of intravenous drug abuse and a medical history of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), was admitted to hospital as an emergency with a seven-day history of productive purulent cough. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with a diagnosis of CAP, with intubation and mechanical ventilation. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and was positive for HSV. The patient developed bilateral pneumothorax with pneumomediastinum, which was fatal, despite aggressive clinical management. CONCLUSIONS Pneumonia due to HSV infection is uncommon but has a high mortality. Although HSV pneumonia has been described in immunocompromised patients, further studies are required to determine the pathogenesis, early detection, identification of patients who are at risk and to determine the most effective approaches to prophylaxis and treatment for HSV pneumonia."

HIV-positive individuals dealing with concurrent health issues, access challenges and competing life demands are hypothesized to be more likely to interrupt treatment. Individuals were included if they initiated cART ≥1 year prior to interview date and had a CD4 cell count and initial regimen recorded at initiation. Using pharmacy recording, a TI was defined as a patient-initiated gap in treatment ≥90 consecutive days during the 12 months preceding or following the study interview. 117 (15.2 %) of 768 participants included in this study had a TI during the study window. 76.0 % of participants were male, 27.5 % were of Aboriginal ancestry and the median age was 46 (interquartile range 40-52). In multivariable logistic regression, TIs were significantly associated with current illicit drug use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.68, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.05-2.68); <95 % adherence in the first year of treatment (aOR 2.68, 95 % CI 1.67-4.12); living with at least one person (aOR 1.95; 95 % CI 1.22-3.14) or living on the street (aOR 5.08, 95 % CI 1.72-14.99) compared to living alone; poor perception of overall health (aOR 1.64 95 % CI 1.05-2.55); being unemployed (aOR: 2.22, 95 % CI 1.16-4.23); and younger age at interview (aOR 0.57, 95 % CI 0.44-0.75, per 10 year increase).

In the present study, sexual and intrafamilial transmission of HCV infection were assessed in the family members of 200 Egyptian patients (index patients) with HCV-RNA positive and biopsy ascertained chronic hepatitis C. Index patients were 139 men (mean age 55+/-11 years) and 61 women (mean age 48+/-8 years). Family members consisted of 200 spouses; 139 women (mean age 45+/-12 years) and 61 men (mean age 58+/-9 years); and 355 children (183 males and 172 females, mean age 11.8+/-10 years). All the family members were tested for the presence of antibodies to HCV in their sera. Thereafter, HCV-RNA detection by PCR and HCV serotype determination were performed in antibody positive contacts. Hepatitis C virus antibodies were detected in 28 (14%) spouses, all of them were also positive for HCV-RNA. Hepatitis C virus serotypes were identical in HCV seropositive patient-spouse pairs (Serotype 4). None of the 355 children involved in this study showed HCV antibodies in their sera. No significant difference was found between the prevalence of male-to-female and female-to-male transmission of HCV. A highly significant association was found between both the age of the spouse and the duration of marriage to index patient and HCV seropositivity in spouses. Moreover, HCV seropositivity in spouses was significantly related to increased serum ALT and HCV-RNA levels, histological severity of chronic hepatitis C and to a history of dental care, as a risk factor for HCV acquisition, in index patients. It was concluded that spouses of patients with HCV viremia and chronic liver disease have an increased risk for acquiring HCV, while intrafamilial acquisition of HCV in non sexual contacts seems to be rare. The authors suggest that spouses of HCV viraemic patients should be followed routinely for markers of HCV infection and liver disease."
12876,0.005,3.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major health care issue in liver and kidney transplantation. Besides negatively affecting both patient and graft survival, HCV is associated with a heightened risk for new onset diabetes mellitus (NODM). The mechanisms underlying the diabetogenicity of HCV are complex but are likely to involve insulin resistance caused by inhibitory actions of the virus on insulin regulatory pathways in the liver. The resultant glucose dysregulation is an important determinant of increased morbidity and mortality in liver and kidney recipients. This review highlights the concerns for outcomes in HCV-positive liver and kidney transplant patients with particular focus on the interrelationship between hepatitis C and diabetes. Data about the potential role of calcineurin inhibitors, corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil in HCV infection and HCV-associated NODM will also be discussed."
512,0.005,3.0000,"This study was designed to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in veterans. Anti-HCV testing was performed in 1,032 patients and a questionnaire regarding sociodemographic characteristics and potential risk factors was administered. Adjusted prevalence of unique HCV-positive patients using outpatient services was 17.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.2%, 18.2%). The following risk factors were associated with HCV infection: a history of injection drug use (IDU), receipt of blood transfusion prior to 1992, history of tattoo (odds ratio [OR], 2.93; 95% CI, 1.70-5.08), combat job as a medical worker (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.25-5.60), history of incarceration over 48 hours (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.52-4.32), greater than 15 lifetime sexual partners (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.94-2.76) and sexual relations with a prostitute (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.82). We concluded that HCV is common in veterans. Risk factors independently associated with infection are IDU, prior transfusion, prior tattoo, combat medical work, incarceration, and multiple opposite sex partners. Infection with HCV among veterans is strongly associated with traditional risk factors for infection and less strongly associated with combat-related risk."

Data on treatment options other than intravenous or intramuscular penicillin for syphilis are very limited. We describe two HIV-infected patients with asymptomatic neurosyphilis who were successfully treated with oral doxycycline. The first patient was a 45-year-old Hispanic man with well-suppressed HIV RNA who had a positive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) titer of 1:128. His cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) revealed a positive VDRL titer of 1:16, and an elevated white blood cell count of 96 cells/mm(3) and protein level of 89 mg/dl. He received high-dose doxycycline 200 mg twice/day for 28 days. Two months later, his CSF VDRL titer, white blood cell count, and protein level decreased to 1:4, 5 cells/mm(3), and 60 mg/dl, respectively. The second patient was a 37-year-old Caucasian man with complications from acquired immunodeficiency disease. A routine VDRL titer was found to be 1:64. Although the CSF VDRL was nonreactive, both his white blood cell count and protein level were elevated at 29 cells/mm(3) and 46 mg/dl, respectively. High-dose doxycycline 200 mg twice/day was prescribed for 28 days. Three months later, the patient's VDRL titer decreased to 1:2; his CSF white blood cell count decreased significantly to 1 cell/mm(3), and his protein level was within normal limits. Clinicians should be aware that an extended course of high-dose, oral doxycycline may be an effective and safe alternative regimen to intravenous or intramuscular penicillin, without requiring hospitalization or home health care, for the treatment of neurosyphilis in HIV-infected patients. Prospective trials are needed to assess the long-term efficacy oral doxycycline for neurosyphilis."
17229,0.005,3.0000,"Outbreaks of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons reported in the United States were very serious and the risks were increased by the delay of diagnosis, rapid progression from infection to active disease, inadequate therapy and poor tuberculosis (TB) control. Prevalence of drug-resistant TB among HIV-infected patients in Japan was studied. The results of drug susceptibility were collected through the nationwide working group for a survey of HIV-infected TB. Data of susceptibility for 39 cases were obtained. The isolates of two cases were resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin (including clinical failure of response), although no outbreak of MDR-TB was found in Japan. Case study of a patient who developed MDR-TB revealed that drug resistance might be selected by insufficient anti-TB therapy. The rate of resistance to any of the anti-TB drugs in HIV-infected patients seemed to be high, although strictly evaluation was difficult due to no standardization for drug susceptibility testing. Of 9 cases with resistance to any of the anti-TB drugs, 8 had extrapulmonary TB including 5 cases of disseminated TB. In contrast thirteen of 30 cases without drug resistance had extrapulmonary TB. Since it has been reported that HIV infection is related to increased rates of drug resistance of TB bacilli, treatment with four-drug regimen should be started and sufficient courses of therapy are needed in HIV-infected TB patients."
5112,0.005,3.0000,"We conducted a study on injecting drug users attending one of 3 drug treatment centres in Naples, to estimate HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) incidence rates and to identify risk factors for seroconversion. Incidence rates were estimated using as denominator the person-time of follow-up of participants who were negative for both HIV and HCV at enrollment and who were retested within 6-12 months. Information on risk factors was collected using a standardized questionnaire. A nested case-control analysis was performed comparing seroconverters with persistently HCV-negative individuals. None of the initially non-infected participants seroconverted for HIV, while the incidence rate for HCV infection was approximately 29 per 100 person-years. Analysis of risk factors showed that age > 28 years and injecting use of cocaine were associated with HCV seroconversion. The protective role of methadone treatment was also marginally significant. Our findings suggest that HCV infection may represent an important public health problem in areas with low HIV circulation. The identification of specific risk factors for HCV infection is needed to plan effective prevention strategies."
3889,0.005,3.0000,"We report the first case of inclusion body myositis (IBM) which occurred after interferon-alpha treatment for chronic hepatitis C. A 63-year-old man contracted hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) from a blood transfusion at age of 18. At age 57, he was treated with interferon-alpha (IFN alpha) for chronic hepatitis C. A month later, he developed muscle weakness in the proximal part of his lower extremities. IBM was diagnosed after a muscle biopsy at age 62. Steroid therapy improved his muscle power. One year later, worsening of his hepatic condition required re-administration of IFN alpha after gradual decrease and discontinuation of prednisolone. However, several days later, he rapidly became weaker and required a cane to walk. Elevated serum creatine kinase (2,199IU/L) and abnormal intensity in his MRI of thigh were demonstrated. The second muscle biopsy, performed after obtaining the informed consent from our patient, confirmed relapse of IBM. His symptoms improved again after discontinuation of IFN alpha and re-induction of prednisolone. Although a few cases each of IBM associated with HCV or HTLV-1 have been reported, the pathogenesis of virus-associated inflammatory myositis has not been clearly understood. Moreover, there has been no description on IBM associated with IFN alpha treatment, though several cases of polymyositis have been reported. Our case suggests that infection of HCV and HTLV-1 may be immunologically involved in the development of IBM and that IFN alpha can be directly related to onset and relapse of IBM."

The subjects were currently active IDUs from a wide spectrum of age, sex, sexual orientation, geographical location and social background, contacted and recruited through their social networks and from community agencies and prisons by trained peer workers who interviewed and collected blood from them in the field. Sera were tested for antibody to HIV, HCV and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and for HCV RNA using reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At entry to the study, 4.5% (14/311) had antibody to HIV, 47% (146/308) to HBcAg and 68% (206/303) to HCV. Prevalence of HBsAg was 1.8% overall (5/282), and 50% (84/168) were positive for HCV RNA. By multivariate analysis, HIV seropositivity was strongly associated with a history of homosexual contact in males and with exposure to HBV but not to HCV. Those who reported their current primary injected drug to be amphetamines were at greater and continuing risk of HIV infection than were current heroin injectors, while the reverse applied for HCV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
12686,0.005,3.0000,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) seropositivity was prospectively evaluated for trauma patients admitted to Memorial Medical Center between September 1989 and August 1990. Epidemiologic data, HIV risk factors, and opportunity for body fluid exposure were compiled for 520 admitted trauma patients 15 years of age or older who met inclusion criteria. Serum samples were obtained from initial laboratory tests. Patient identifiers were removed, and matching blinded numbers were placed on patient serum and data forms. Centers for Disease Control laboratories tested for HIV with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The Epi-Info (Version 5.01, 1990) software package was used for statistical analysis of epidemiologic data. Results showed HIV seropositivity of admitted trauma patients to be 0.96 per cent (5/520). HIV seroprevalence among young black males from our urban area who were injured during violent aggression was 3.5 per cent. Management of 80 per cent of patients resulted in opportunity for body fluid exposure. Illicit drug use was reported by 15 per cent; 7.5 per cent gave a history of transfusion since 1977; 3 per cent identified high risk sexual partners; three patients reported homosexual activity. Two patients denied risk factors, but were HIV-seropositive. The results indicate that HIV exposure is a potential hazard to health care workers and that HIV risk factors alone are not reliable in identifying the HIV-positive patient."

The efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF single-tablet regimen is the first once-daily, single-tablet, triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) formulation available for the treatment of HIV infection and, in the EU, is indicated for use in adults infected with HIV-1 who have been virologically suppressed for >3 months on their current ART regimen. In treatment-experienced adults with HIV-1 infection already virologically suppressed with ART, switching to once-daily triple combination therapy with efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF (including the single-tablet regimen) is effective in maintaining virological suppression and is generally well tolerated, according to several randomized, open-label or noncomparative multicentre trials and an open-label extension study of up to 96 weeks' duration. Moreover, additional data from some of these studies indicate that adherence to treatment was maintained or improved after switching to the once-daily triple combination, with patients generally preferring the efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF single-tablet regimen over their previous more complex regimen and (in one of two trials) finding it easier to follow. Thus, the efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF single-tablet regimen provides a convenient once-daily regimen for use in treatment-experienced adults that may confer an advantage over more complex or frequently administered regimens for which adherence to treatment is an issue."
12276,0.005,3.0000,"Ditiocarb sodium has been reported to reduce the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. To confirm this therapeutic activity and to evaluate the effect of ditiocarb sodium in the early stages of HIV infection, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic adults with HIV infection. Patients were followed during a 24 mo period, with a clinical and laboratory evaluation every 4 mo. Of 1333 patients who continued therapy after day 1, 669 were randomized to ditiocarb and 664 to placebo. The two treatment groups were comparable at entry, except for the CD4+ cell count, which was lower in the ditiocarb (median 416/mm3) than in the placebo group (median 458/mm3). Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) developed in 106 patients in the ditiocarb group as compared with 68 in the placebo group; 285 patients progressed to AIDS-related complex (157 ditiocarb, 128 placebo); 55 patients died (34 ditiocarb; 21 placebo). The risk of progression to AIDS, after adjustment for baseline CD4+ cell count, was significantly higher in the ditiocarb than in the placebo group (adjusted relative risk = 1.41; p = 0.027). A decrease in CD4+ cell counts was observed, with no significant difference between the ditiocarb and the placebo group. A positive effect of ditiocarb given in the condition of this study can be excluded. Although previous studies have shown opposite results, this study suggests that the use of ditiocarb in HIV-infected patients should be discontinued."
6464,0.005,3.0000,"Collection of antiretroviral medication adherence data in the homes of HIV-infected people may have methodological advantages that can improve data quality. However, the feasibility of this approach has not been established. In addition, data on adherence, and its predictors, among HIV-infected women have been limited. Sixty-three HIV-positive women who were prescribed at least one antiretroviral drug in the last month were interviewed in their homes. A standard instrument was used to collect data on all antiretroviral medications prescribed and taken in the three days prior to the interview. Data were also collected on factors thought potentially to affect the ability to be adherent. The results of this study suggest that it is feasible to conduct home-based adherence research. Sixty-seven per cent reported taking all prescribed antiretroviral medication doses. One-third took a sub-optimal dose putting themselves at increased risk of treatment failure and the selection of resistant HIV strains. Unintentional reasons for missing doses were most commonly reported. An ability to describe the intended effect of antiretroviral therapy on HIV viral load was the best predictor of adherence. This finding is consistent with other research suggesting that adherence is associated with an understanding and belief in the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy."

Although HIV infection is well-controlled in most of this population, they suffer liver-associated morbidity and mortality. Conversely, hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment uptake remains quite low (15%-30%). Therefore, the purpose of this qualitative study was to explore HCV treatment experiences and decision making in adults with HIV infection. The study sample included 39 coinfected adults; 16 in the HCV-treated cohort (who were interviewed a maximum of 3 times) and 23 in the HCV-nontreatment cohort. Analysis of interviews identified 2 treatment barriers (fears and vicarious experiences) and 4 facilitating factors (experience with illness management, patient-provider relationships, gaining sober time, and facing treatment head-on). Analysis of these data also revealed a preliminary model to guide intervention development and theoretical perspectives. Ultimately, research is urgently needed to test interventions that improve HCV evaluation and treatment uptake among HIV-infected patients."
14774,0.005,3.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) started to become more widely available in Vietnam in 2005. However, up to now, very little is known about factors influencing ART adherence among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Vietnam. This qualitative study aimed to describe factors influencing ART adherence among PLHIV in a northern province in Vietnam, and to explore possibilities of home delivery of ART. Forty-eight participants (36 men and 12 women), including patients on ART and their relatives, were divided in seven focus group discussions. The topics discussed included: adherence obstacles encountered during ART, methods patients used to enhance adherence, treatment support structures, and attitudes toward home delivery of ART. All interviews were audio-recorded, then transcribed in Vietnamese. Manual manifest and latent content analysis was applied for data analysis in order to elucidate the presence of, meaning of, and relationships between concepts in the text. Stigma was identified as a strong barrier to ART adherence, as patients feared that taking medications in the presence of other persons would lead to suspicion or inadvertent disclosure of their HIV status. In addition to desires for non-disclosure influencing PLHIV's adherence, it also shaped their attitudes toward opting for more confidential ways of receiving ART support and care. Home delivery of ART medications was seen as undesirable by participants, who feared that it might increase social stigmatization. Participants wished for more community-based support, preferably from PLHIV who had received sufficient training. Based on the results of this study, an intervention strategy using PLHIV as community-based adherence supporters is currently being evaluated in a randomized controlled trial intervention, including 640 patients in Quang Ninh, Vietnam."

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with elevated serum lipid levels, and HCV infection is associated with low serum lipid levels. Fasting lipid levels were investigated in 1,434 ART-naïve HIV-infected people participating in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Longitudinal Linked Randomized Trials (ALLRT) protocol who prospectively initiated ART with 3 agents. Subjects with elevated liver-associated enzymes (>5 x ULN) were excluded. Demographics, body mass index, HCV status, CD4 cell count, HIV RNA, liver enzymes, lipid levels, and glucose were assessed before and following 48 weeks of ART. HCV-positive subjects (n = 160; 11%) were older, more likely to be Black, have a history of intravenous drug use (IDU), have higher baseline liver-associated enzyme levels than the HCV-negative group (p < .001 for each), and to have diabetes at baseline (5% vs. 2%, p = .07). Lipid levels rose in both groups following ART, and the differences were not significant except that HDL levels increased significantly more in the HCV-positive group (p = .006). In summary, HCV infection did not appear to provide significant protection against ART-induced hyperlipidemia in this cohort of HIV-infected subjects prospectively enrolled in ART trials, although HDL levels rose to a greater degree."

The goal of this research was to estimate prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in risk groups, and to determine association hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and risk factors. Research included 4627 subjects divided in two groups. Test group included 2627 subjects divided in 4 subgroups with risk for HCV infection: those who received blood transfusion without screening on HCV (it was introduced in 1995) (700); intravenous drug users (60); patients on hemodialysis (168) and health care workers (1699). Control group included 2000 healthy volunteer blood donors. In all subjects anti-HCV antibodies were tested with third generation ELISA test. Positive serum samples were tested for presence of HCVRNA, using reaction of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. In all anti-HCV positive subjects further epidemiological and clinical workup was performed. Prevalence of HCV infection in risk groups was: 4.6% in subjects who have received blood transfusions without HCV blood screening, 35% in intravenous drug users, 58.9% in patients on chronic dialysis, and 0.4% in health care workers. In control group prevalence was low (0.2%). In the group of 158 anti-HCV positive subjects, 73.4% had HCVRNA. The largest number of subjects with HCV infection was in the age group of 30-49 years (45.8%). This study showed that multiple blood transfusions before introducing the blood screening for HCV, longer duration of intravenous drug abuse, longer duration of hemodialysis treatment, larger number of accidental injuries in health care workers are independent and statistically significant risk factors for those groups examined. Results of this study confirm that general screening for HCV infection is recommended in risk groups for HCV infection in order to identify to prevent and to treat it."
10896,0.005,3.0000,"To determine the frequency and risk factors for female to male sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a prospective study was carried out in 422 men who had acquired a sexually transmitted disease (STD) from a group of prostitutes with a prevalence of HIV-1 infection of 85%. The initial seroprevalence of HIV among the men was 12%. 24 of 293 (8.2%) initially seronegative men seroconverted to HIV-1. Newly acquired infection was independently associated with frequent prostitute contact (risk ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2-8.1), with the acquisition of genital ulcer disease (risk ratio 4.7, 95% confidence interval 1.3-17.0), and with being uncircumcised (risk ratio 8.2, 95% confidence interval 3.0-23.0). 96% of documented seroconversions occurred in men with one or both of the latter two risk factors. In a subgroup of 73 seronegative men who reported a single prostitute sexual contact, the frequency of HIV-1 infection was 8.2% during 12 weeks of observation. No man without a genital ulcer seroconverted. A cumulative 43% of uncircumcised men who acquired an ulcer seroconverted to HIV-1 after a single sexual exposure. These data indicate an extremely high rate of female to male transmission of HIV-1 in the presence of STD and confirm a causal relation between lack of male circumcision, genital ulcer disease, and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection."
15195,0.005,3.0000,"Study GS-99-907 was a 48-week, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled intensification trial of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF). Antiretroviral-experienced patients added tenofovir DF 300 mg once daily to their existing regimen. The patterns of HIV-1 resistance development and the corresponding virologic responses were evaluated in a virology substudy at week 48. Although 94% of these treatment-experienced patients had nucleoside-associated resistance mutations (NAMs) at baseline, addition of tenofovir DF resulted in a mean reduction in viral load of -0.59 log10 copies/mL after 24 weeks that was durable through 48 weeks. Relative to the placebo-controlled arm, patients in the tenofovir DF arm had a reduced frequency of development of resistance mutations to all classes of HIV-1 inhibitors, with reduction in new protease inhibitor (PI)-associated mutations achieving statistical significance. The K65R mutation, which occurred in 8 patients (3%), was the only emergent mutation directly associated with tenofovir DF therapy. New thymidine analogue-associated mutations (TAMs) emerged in 19% of patients by week 48. Other than K65R, the patterns of mutations that developed were not significantly different between the tenofovir DF and placebo control arms, suggesting that the background therapies caused their development. The K65R mutation emerged only in patients with no detectable TAMs at baseline, whereas new TAMs developed similarly between patients with or without TAMs at baseline. Development of K65R was associated with mostly low-level changes in phenotypic susceptibility to tenofovir DF and other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and was not associated with viral load rebound. No novel patterns of genotypic or phenotypic resistance to tenofovir were identified. Therefore, intensification with once-daily tenofovir DF therapy resulted in a sustained reduction in HIV-1 viral load and a low risk for development of the K65R mutation in this treatment-experienced patient population."
4902,0.005,3.0000,"The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) cares for many human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus (HIV/HCV)-coinfected patients. VA treatment recommendations indicate that all HIV/HCV-coinfected patients undergo evaluation for HCV treatment and list pretreatment assessment tests. We compared clinical practice with these recommendations. We identified 377 HIV/HCV-coinfected veterans who began HCV therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin and 4135 HIV/HCV-coinfected veterans who did not but were in VA care at the same facilities during the same period. We compared laboratory and clinical characteristics of the two groups and estimated multivariate logistic regression models of receipt of HCV treatment. Overall, patients had high rates of receipt of tests necessary for HCV pretreatment assessment. Patients starting HCV treatment had higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lower creatinine, higher CD4 counts and lower HIV viral loads than patients not starting HCV treatment. In the multivariate model, positive predictors of starting HCV treatment included being non-Hispanic whites, having higher ALTs, lower creatinines, higher HCV viral loads, higher CD4 counts, undetectable HIV viral loads and receiving HIV antiretrovirals. A history of chronic mental illness and a history of hard drug use were negative predictors. Most HIV/HCV-coinfected patients received the necessary HCV pretreatment assessments, although rates of screening for hepatitis A and B immunity can be improved. Having well-controlled HIV disease is by far the most important modifiable factor affecting the receipt of HCV treatment. More research is needed to determine if the observed racial differences in starting HCV treatment reflect biological differences, provider behaviour or patient preference."
18115,0.005,3.0000,"Although different factors have been implicated in the CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio recovery in HIV-infected patients who receive effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), limited information exists on the influence of the regimen composition. A longitudinal study carried out in a prospective, single-center cohort of HIV-infected patients. ART regimens including non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), protease inhibitors (PI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) from patients who achieved long-term (≥6-month duration) virological suppression (HIV-RNA < 400 copies/mL) from January 1998 to June 2014 were analyzed. The impact of ART composition on the changes of the CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio was modeled using a mixed linear approach with adjustment for possible confounders. A total of 1068 ART regimens from 570 patients were analyzed. Mean (SD) age of the patients was 42.15 (10.68) years and 276 (48.42%) had hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. Five hundred fifty-eight (52.25%) regimens were PI-based, 439 (40.10%) NNRTI-based, and 71 (6.65%) INSTI-based; 487 (45.60%) were initial regimens, 476 (44.57%) simplification, and 105 (9.83%) salvage regimens. Median (IQR) number of regimens was 1 (1-2) per patient, of 29 (14-58) months duration, and 4 (3-7) CD4/CD8 measurements per regimen. The median baseline CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.42, 0.50, and 0.54, respectively, with the PI-, NNRTI-, and INSTI-based regimens (P = 0.0073). Overall median (IQR) increase of CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.0245 (-0.0352-0.0690) per year, and a CD4/CD8 ratio ≥1 was achieved in 19.35% of the cases with PI-based, 25.97% with NNRTI-based, and 22.54% with INSTI-based regimens (P = 0.1406). In the adjusted model, the mean CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio increase was higher with NNRTI-based regimens compared for PI-based (estimated coefficient for PI [95% CI], -0.0912 [-0.1604 to -0.0219], P = 0.009). Also, a higher CD4/CD8 baseline ratio was associated with higher CD4/CD8 increase in the adjusted model (P = 0.001); by contrast, higher age (P = 0.020) and simplification of ART regimen (P = 0.003) had a negative impact on the CD4/CD8 ratio. Antiretroviral regimen composition has a differential impact on the CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio; NNRTI-based regimens are associated with enhanced CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio recovery compared to PI-based antiretroviral regimens."
8044,0.005,3.0000,"Low adherence and toxicities among HIV-positive patients starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can lead to discontinuation of therapy and treatment failure. Little is known about hepatitis C (HCV) status and discontinuation of HAART. Poisson regression was used to determine factors related to discontinuation of any part of an initial HAART regimen due to treatment failure (TF) or toxicities and patient/ physician choice (TOX), and to investigate the relationship between HCV and discontinuation of a HAART regimen in 1198 patients staring HAART after 1999 from the EuroSIDA study. At 1 year after starting HAART, 70% of patients remained on their original regimen, 24% had changed, and 6% were off all treatment. The most frequent reason for discontinuation was toxicities (30.4%). The incidence of any discontinuation was significantly lower after 1999 compared to before [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.43; 95% CI 0.35-0.53, p < 0.0001], this pattern was most marked for toxicities (IRR 0.28; 95% CI 0.20-0.39, p < 0.0001) and patient/physician choice (IRR 0.49; 95% CI 0.33-0.73, p < 0.0001). Patients with HCV had a higher incidence of discontinuation due to TOX (IRR 1.46, 95% CI 1.13-1.88, p = 0.0042) compared to patients without HCV. Patients with HCV were more likely to discontinue all or part of their HAART regimens due to toxicity or patient/physician choice. Managing adverse events must remain a key intervention in maintaining HAART. There is a need for further studies to describe the relationship between HCV, specific antiretrovirals, and different treatment strategies."

Thirty-seven HIV-infected patients failing protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral regimens who started salvage therapy containing darunavir-ritonavir were prospectively studied. The primary outcome of the study was a viral load (VL) of <50 copies/ml at week 48. The trough concentrations of darunavir in plasma, the number of darunavir resistance mutations, the change in the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of darunavir in the virtual phenotype, and the darunavir gIQ and vIQ were correlated with the virological outcome in regression analyses adjusted by the number of active drugs in the background regimen. The VL was <50 copies/ml in 56.8% of patients at week 48. Changes in the VL were not significantly associated with the darunavir concentration (P = 0.304), the number of darunavir resistance mutations (P = 0.695), or the change in the IC(50) (P = 0.750). However, patients with darunavir vIQs of >or=1.5 had a 12-fold greater chance of achieving a >or=1 log(10) reduction in the VL (odds ratio [OR], 12.7; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.9 to 81.6; P = 0.007), and a 5-fold greater chance of achieving a VL of <50 copies/ml (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 24.5; P = 0.028), at week 48 than patients with darunavir vIQs of <1.5. The positive and negative predictive values of this darunavir vIQ cutoff for achieving a VL of <50 copies/ml at week 48 were 70% and 69%, respectively. The darunavir vIQ predicts virological response to darunavir-based salvage therapy better than the darunavir trough concentration or resistance mutations alone. We suggest targeting a darunavir vIQ of 1.5 for achieving long-term viral suppression."
12251,0.005,3.0000,"Sexual contact is the major mode of HIV transmission. Increased sexual risk taking has been described in HIV-infected individuals receiving potent antiretroviral therapy. A new questionnaire on sexual behavior was introduced into the Swiss HIV Cohort Study on April 1, 2000. We evaluated sexual behavior in all individuals who completed the questionnaire for the first time within 1 year after its introduction. Our primary hypothesis was that self-reported unsafe sexual behavior would be more prevalent among individuals with optimal viral suppression. On April 1, 2000, 4948 individuals were registered in the study, and 4723 (95%) completed the questionnaire. Of these individuals, 12% reported unsafe sex, 78% received antiretroviral therapy, and 25% had optimal viral suppression (HIV RNA level always <50 copies/mL during the preceding 12 months). During the preceding 6 months, 55% of individuals had stable and 19% had occasional partners, and 6% had both types of partners. Sexual intercourse was reported by 82% of individuals with stable and 87% of individuals with occasional partners, and of those reporting sexual intercourse in each group, 76% and 86%, respectively, said that they always used condoms. After adjustment for covariates, reported unsafe sex was not associated with optimal viral suppression (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.33) or antiretroviral therapy (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.07), but it was associated with gender, age, ethnicity, HIV transmission group, HIV status of partner, having occasional partners, and living alone. There is no evidence that self-reported unsafe sexual behavior is more prevalent among HIV-infected individuals with optimal viral suppression. However, unsafe sex is associated with other factors."
3591,0.005,3.0000,"Current HIV treatment guidelines emphasize the importance of using an active antiretroviral therapy regimen that produces full virologic suppression and immunologic competence, while at the same time providing patients with a favorable safety profile and limited risk for development of drug resistance. Etravirine (TMC125), a recently approved, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), has shown durable, superior virologic efficacy over placebo in the Phase III, randomized, double-blind DUET trials in 1,203 treatment-experienced, NNRTI-resistant, HIV-1-infected patients. Statistical significance of responses with etravirine over placebo was maintained through Week 24, 48 and 96, regardless of baseline demographics, baseline disease characteristics or the background regimen used. Etravirine has demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile; the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable with placebo in the DUET trials, with the exception of rash. The tolerability profile of etravirine also appears to be favorable in terms of neuropsychiatric and hepatic side effects. The pharmacokinetic profile of twice-daily etravirine minimizes the potential for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions and allows for its use in combination with a wide range of other agents. In addition, etravirine has a high genetic barrier to the development of resistance, further enhancing potential benefit in patients infected with NNRTI-resistant virus. The clinical efficacy and favorable safety profile of etravirine, together with its pharmacokinetic profile and high genetic barrier to resistance, make it a valuable treatment option for a wide range of treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients."
754,0.005,3.0000,"Injection drug users who continue to use drugs may not respond to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as well as other HIV-infected individuals, even after adjusting for a reliable measure of adherence. We therefore compared the virologic response among participants in a population-based HIV/AIDS Drug Treatment Program in British Columbia, Canada, by injection drug use activity. Participants who were HIV infected and naive to antiretroviral therapy and who were prescribed antiretroviral treatment between August 1996 and December 2000 were eligible for this study. They were classified as current, former, or non-injection drug users. The main outcome was having two consecutive HIV-1 RNA levels less than 500 copies/mL. We used logistic regression to adjust for baseline HIV-1 RNA, type of antiretroviral regimen (2 nucleosides + nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor versus 2 nucleosides + protease inhibitor), duration of therapy (months), adherence (derived from refill compliance data), and age. A total of 578 participants were first prescribed HAART during the study period. Among them, 78 (13%) were current injection drug users, 96 (17%) were former injection drug users, and 404 (70%) never injected drugs. In the multivariable logistic regression, relative to non-drug users, current injection drug users were significantly less likely to suppress their HIV-1 RNA (adjusted OR [AOR] = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.13-0.67), and former injection drug users were not significantly different from non-drug users (AOR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.24-1.34). There was a significant interaction between drug use and adherence. In the analyses stratified by drug use, the adherence of former and non-drug users was positively associated with HIV-1 RNA suppression (AOR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.14-1.55), whereas for current drug users, it was not (AOR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.87-1.33). Current injection drug users were less likely to achieve HIV-1 RNA suppression compared with non-drug users. Adherence as measured by pharmacy refill compliance was not a reliable measure in this subpopulation."
12659,0.005,3.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related renal disease is the third-leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among African Americans aged 20-64 years. The number of HIV-infected (HIV+) patients reaching ESRD will increase exponentially over the next decade. Because of significant improvements in therapy and management during the last ten years, survival of HIV+ patients has improved. The survival experience of very long-term HIV+ peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients remains to be investigated. The objective of the present study was to examine the important differences in clinical and laboratory parameters between HIV+ and HIV-negative (HIV-) PD patients. To assess the factors associated with better survival in HIV+ PD patients, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of 488 PD patients, including 53 HIV+ patients, for the period 1987 to September 2004. We collected demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, including CD4 cell counts and history of hospitalizations and peritonitis. Maximum survival of HIV+ PD patients was 12.5 years as compared with 15.87 years in HIV-patients. Not surprisingly, HIV was a strong independent predictor of mortality in PD patients [relative risk (RR) = 3.09, p < 0.0001]. In HIV+ patients, higher CD4 counts at the initiation of dialysis were strongly associated with better survival (RR = 0.10 and p < 0.0001, > or =200 cells/mm3 vs. < or =50 cells/mm3). In univariate analysis, use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was associated with significantly improved survival in HIV+ PD patients. Patients treated with I or 2 drugs had a 4.3-times higher mortality risk than those who received HAART therapy (p = 0.012). Independent associations were seen between HIV and younger age, African American race, male sex, and lower serum albumin. The rates of hospitalization (p < 0.0001) and peritonitis (p < 0.01) were significantly higher in HIV+ patients than in HIV-patients. Very long-term survival of HIV+ patients with chronic renal failure is possible on PD therapy. Morbidity and mortality of these patients may be improved with HAART therapy, better nutrition, and treatment of peritonitis."
16014,0.005,3.0000,"The Italian Seroconversion Study (ISS) involves 16 major HIV-treatment centers across Italy and about 1,200 individuals. These individuals were HIV-negative less than 2 years before the first positive test and seroconverted between 1980 and 1994. The majority were infected through i.v. drug use (56%), male-to-male sex (25%), and heterosexual contact (7%). For each end point, crude and adjusted relative hazards were calculated using standard survival techniques such as Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Autoregression models were used to describe CD4 cell reductions. Objectives were as follows: to estimate HIV disease progression rates; to assess whether there are differences in the rate of development of severe immunosuppression, AIDS, and death according to age, gender, and exposure category; to identify co-factors and predictors of disease progression; and to evaluate the clinic-based population ""effect"" of antiretroviral treatment. The risk for developing AIDS among individuals in the ISS cohort was less than 50% by 10 years after HIV seroconversion. Using univariate analysis, more rapid progression was found for older individuals than for younger individuals and for homosexual men compared with those in other exposure categories. No difference between men and women was observed. After adjusting for age, differences among exposure groups disappeared. Individuals with a history of acute HIV disease were more likely to develop AIDS than other seroconverters. Co-infection with HCV and HTLV-II did not accelerate progression to AIDS. The cumulative incidence of receiving pre-AIDS therapy within 7 years of seroconversion was 49.2% (95% CI 45.3-53.0). The relative hazards of developing AIDS in patients who started treatment with zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy was 0.57 (0.36-0.91) and 0.92 (0.64-1.33) within the first year and after 1 year from AZT initiation, respectively. The effect was greater among homosexual men than among i.v. drug users. In conclusion, incident cohort studies may provide accurate information on incubation time and co-factors for disease progression. Observational studies may also provide useful information about the effect of treatment at the community level, which may complement the results of clinical trials."
16292,0.005,3.0000,"We systematically reviewed the literature on the extent to which population characteristics or clinical features predict groups of individuals likely to develop advanced liver disease or die from chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). We searched Medline to include studies with reported cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer, or death outcomes after at least 1 year of follow-up from the measurement of predictive factors (age, age at infection, geographic location, race/ethnicity, sex, positive family history, presence of coinfections, HBV viral level, change in hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg] status, genotype, HBV mutations, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol consumption, liver enzymes, and liver biopsy finding). Evidence from 41 included articles suggested that cirrhosis, higher HBV viral level, and male sex were consistently associated with significantly increased risk of death and liver cancer. Evidence about the role of HBV genotype, HBeAg status, age and duration of infection, coinfections with hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis delta virus, and alanine aminotransferase levels were limited and inconsistent, but were deemed promising to identify patients at higher risk of clinical outcomes. Adults with chronic hepatitis B had increased risk for poorer health outcomes compared to the general population; however, the magnitude of risk varied greatly depending on baseline patient and disease characteristics, and typically clinical outcomes required many years to become manifest. Many adults with chronic hepatitis B had low absolute risks of clinical outcomes and likely would not benefit from immediate treatment. Baseline patient and disease characteristics provide important information about the risk of clinical outcomes and should be incorporated into monitoring or treatment decisions."
521,0.005,3.0000,"There is a high burden of underlying substance use and mental illness in HIV-infected populations. HIV-care settings provide an important opportunity to assess substance and mental health needs among HIV-positive patients and to provide or make referrals for appropriate treatment services. In 2003, with funding from the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), we developed a model of integrated substance-use counselling and referral for treatment within a primary care HIV-care setting at The Miriam Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. The project uses a multidisciplinary approach to provide linkage to treatment services for substance use and mental illness as well as to help participants with social service needs, such as housing and medical coverage, to ensure continuity of care and optimal HIV treatment adherence. Twelve percent of the 965 HIV-infected patients in care at our center have been enrolled in the project. Of these, all have a current substance-use disorder and 79.3% have been diagnosed with a mental illness. In addition, most participants are hepatitis C-positive (HCV) (65.5%). The majority of participants are on antiretroviral therapy (76.7%). Participants have been referred for the following treatment modalities: intensive outpatient services, methadone, buprenorphine, outpatient services and residential as well as individual and group counselling. Our model has been successful in assessing the substance-use and mental health needs of HIV-infected individuals with numerous co-morbidities and referring them for ancillary medical and social services."
17026,0.005,3.0000,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the frequency and determinants of rectal bleeding and the association between rectal bleeding and risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among homosexual/ bisexual men in Mexico City. Men who requested anonymous HIV testing at a public clinic in Mexico City and who reported engaging in any homosexual behavior were eligible to participate in this study. Trained staff collected information on demographic factors, sexual behavior, psychological states, and HIV serostatus from all consenting, eligible clients. Logistic regression modeling was used to investigate the independent effect of risk factors among 2,758 men who were tested between June 1991 and December 1992. Bleeding during anal intercourse was a common occurrence: More than one third of the men in the study reported some bleeding, and 8% reported bleeding in half or more of their intercourse episodes. The prevalence of HIV infection among bleeders was 42% as compared with 28% in nonbleeders (p < 0.0001), and the adjusted odds ratio was 1.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.8) for men who bled in more than half of their anal intercourse episodes relative to nonbleeders. There was a trend of increasing HIV seroprevalence with increasing frequency of rectal bleeding (p = 0.001). Nine percent of all HIV infections and 42% of infections among frequent bleeders were attributable to rectal bleeding. Men who reported both rectal bleeding and anal warts were 3.5 (95% CI 2.1-5.8) times more likely to be HIV-infected in multivariate analysis than men reporting neither rectal bleeding nor anal warts. Determinants of rectal bleeding included older age, more education, more receptive anal intercourse than insertive intercourse, receptive digital-anal contact, anal warts, and genital ulcers. Among men reporting sex with men in Mexico City, rectal bleeding is common. It is an independent risk factor for HIV infection, and warrants attention in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome prevention efforts. Rectal bleeding that results from rupture of anal warts may be an especially effective portal of HIV transmission."
16730,0.005,3.0000,"In sub-Saharan Africa where weight loss is very difficult to estimate, cross-sectional anthropometric indicators could be useful to predict human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated mortality. The study objective was to look for threshold values of baseline body mass index, arm muscle circumference, and fat mass to predict the risk of death in HIV-infected adults included in a 1996-1998 trial of early cotrimoxazole chemoprophylaxis in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire (COTRIMO-CI-ANRS 059 trial). The authors graphically determined if consecutive anthropometric categories with the closest hazards ratios of the risk of death could be clustered to obtain a unique threshold that distinctly separated two categories. When the threshold values were determined, the authors estimated the hazards ratio of mortality of this two-category model. A significant increase of mortality was observed for a body mass index of < or =20.3 in men (hazards ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4, 5.0) and of < or =18.5 in women (hazards ratio = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.05, 4.5) and for a fat mass of < or =6% in men (hazards ratio = 4.6; 95% CI: 2.3, 9.4) and of < or =18% in women (hazards ratio = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.2, 4.9). No simple threshold could be identified for arm muscle circumference. In Côte d'Ivoire where chemoprophylaxis of opportunistic infections has recently been recommended to be widely initiated on clinical criteria, such thresholds may help to screen patients with higher risks of mortality."
14765,0.005,3.0000,"Although the reduction in HIV-1-related deaths with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is similar in adults and children, the extent of the changes in two important surrogate markers HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ T cell counts, differs widely. In most paediatric studies virological response rates to HAART are inferior to those in adults. This review provides an overview of the paediatric clinical studies using HAART and seeks to improve the understanding of factors that may contribute to success or failure of HAART in children. An overview of all current articles on paediatric clinical trials using HAART is provided. 23 papers were available. HIV-1 RNA loads and CD4+ T cell counts were used as primary outcome measures. Virological response rates were highly variable, both among the different antiretroviral drugs but also among different studies using the same medication. Four studies in which dosages of the administrated protease inhibitor (PI) were adjusted after pharmacokinetic evaluation had superior virological response rates compared with those in which fixed dosages were used. Immunological response rates were more uniform than virological responses. In almost all studies increases of CD4+ T cell counts are reported independent of the extent of the virological response. Side-effects of HAART were generally mild, transient, and of gastrointestinal origin. Significant percentages of patients with serum lipid abnormalities were reported in three paediatric studies. However, signs of clinical lipodystrophy were not observed. The inferior virological response rates, which have been reported in HIV-1 infected children treated with HAART form a reflection of the challenges that are encountered in the treatment of these children. Difficulties with adherence and with the pharmacokinetics of PIs in children require an intensive, child-adjusted approach. A practical approach to therapy in institutions without tertiary care facilities may be induction therapy with a lopinavir containing regimen (lacking a need for therapeutic drug monitoring), to reduce high viral load levels followed by an easily tolerated maintenance regimen, for example containing abacavir or nevirapine."
7067,0.005,3.0000,"Inconsistent use of antiviral medications for the treatment of HIV may lead to the emergence of resistant strains in HIV-infected adults. Patterns of adherence with these drug regimens in adolescents remains unknown. Identifying nonadherence in HIV-infected patients to antiviral regimens and developing corrective measures could improve patient outcomes. This study was undertaken to understand adherence in HIV-infected youths engaged in care and to reduce patterns of nonadherence. A retrospective analysis of 25 charts (78%) of HIV-infected youths (n = 32, age 13 to 21 years) were consecutively reviewed from January 1993 to May 1998. Charts were reviewed for documentation of factors previously documented to be associated with adherence: housing stability, social support, prior sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and/or pregnancy, HIV exposure category, number of clinic visits, number of pills per day, number of medications per day, knowledge of medication schedule, age, gender, race/ethnicity, health status as revealed by CD4 count and viral load, and recorded patterns of adherence to medications and clinic appointments. Thirteen of the 18 (72%) patients who were receiving antiretroviral medication were nonadherent. Sixty-seven percent of the females and 80% of the males reported missing doses. Housing instability (p = 0.031) and/or length of treatment with antiviral medications (months of treatment) (p = 0.043) were significantly correlated with nonadherence. The stability of the adolescents' living situations was the most significant correlate of medication adherence for this population of HIV-infected youth."
16879,0.005,3.0000,"Opioid dependence and overdose have increased to epidemic levels in the United States. The 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated that 4.3 million persons were nonmedical users of prescription pain relievers (1). These users are 40 times more likely than the general population to use heroin or other injection drugs (2). Furthermore, CDC estimated a near quadrupling of heroin-related overdose deaths during 2002-2014 (3). Although overdose contributes most to drug-associated mortality, infectious complications of intravenous drug use constitute a major cause of morbidity leading to hospitalization (4). In addition to infections from hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), injecting drug users are at increased risk for acquiring invasive bacterial infections, including endocarditis (5,6). Evidence that hospitalizations for endocarditis are increasing in association with the current opioid epidemic exists (7-9). To examine trends in hospitalizations for endocarditis among persons in North Carolina with drug dependence during 2010-2015, data from the North Carolina Hospital Discharge database were analyzed. The incidence of hospital discharge diagnoses for drug dependence combined with endocarditis increased more than twelvefold from 0.2 to 2.7 per 100,000 persons per year over this 6-year period. Correspondingly, hospital costs for these patients increased eighteenfold, from $1.1 million in 2010 to $22.2 million in 2015. To reduce the risk for morbidity and mortality related to opioid-associated endocarditis, public health programs and health care systems should consider collaborating to implement syringe service programs, harm reduction strategies, and opioid treatment programs."
1479,0.005,3.0000,"The aim of this study was to assess sexual activity, condom use and disclosure of HIV infection status among HIV-infected women 3-12 months after delivery and to identify factors associated with unsafe sex. A cross-sectional study was carried out on 480 HIV-positive sexually active new mothers in 48 primary health care clinics in Nkangala District. Post-natal women were recruited by systematic sampling (every consecutive patient over a period of 2 months) and responded to a questionnaire. Overall, 31.9% reported unsafe sex with an HIV-uninfected of unknown-status partner. In multivariate regression analysis, not having disclosed their HIV status, having experienced physical partner violence, lack of male involvement and not having attended a support group were associated with unsafe sex. Several risk factors for unsafe sex post-natally have been identified and can be utilised in post-partum sexual health education programmes. "
11090,0.005,3.0000,"We evaluated the extent to which depressive disorders, psychiatric distress, and psychosocial stressors are related to three measures of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) illness, both cross-sectionally and during a 6-month period, in a community sample of 124 HIV-positive homosexual men. The dependent variables are immune status measured by CD4 and CD8 cell subsets, number of signs and symptoms commonly associated with HIV infection, and a cumulative index of HIV illness stage. We chose to focus on CD4 cell count because it is the immune marker most closely linked to the clinical consequences of HIV infection. We found no relationships between the independent variables and immune status or illness stage. The HIV-positive men who were depressed or distressed or who reported more life stressors had no greater immunosuppression or more advanced illness stage than did the others, either concurrently or across occasions. We did find a suggestive pattern of association between depressive disorders, distress, and stressors and the number of HIV-related symptoms, which warrants further study."
12914,0.005,3.0000,"Consistent individual effort in engagement in HIV medical services has been associated with positive health outcomes in people living with HIV (PLHIV). However, whether these benefits are facilitated by improved medication adherence has not been widely studied. This study aimed to investigate the marginal effect of engagement in HIV care on medication adherence at a public health facility in Kenya. Between February and April 2013, 392 patients on HIV care at Nyeri Provincial General Hospital participated in this study. Data were collected using a self-administered health survey questionnaire assessing health and sociodemographic statuses. A manual stepwise general linear model was specified to measure the effect of engagement in HIV and other associated predictors on medication adherence. Engagement in HIV care was significantly associated with log-transformed medication adherence in the sample (100·β = 9.2%, 95% CI 3.2-15.1) irrespective of gender and other selected predictors. Longer duration on antiretroviral therapy was also a significant predictor of better medication adherence (100·β = 3.2%, 95% CI 2.3-4.1). Despite inter-gender differences in adherence and engagement determinants, gender's independent effect on medication adherence and engagement in care were not statistically significant. Poor medication adherence was associated with lower patient engagement in HIV care services, suggesting that interventions which remove obstacles to regular observance of scheduled clinic appointments and eventual retention may have a beneficial impact on medication adherence and, accordingly, health outcomes in PLHIV.

13220,0.005,3.0000,"Use of herbal medicines among patients receiving Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) remains by far an uncharacterised phenomenon in Africa and Uganda specifically. We evaluated the use of herbal medicines among patients on ART at the HIV clinic of Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH), examined factors associated with their concomitant use and their impact on ART adherence. This was a cross-sectional study among 334 systematically sampled patients receiving ART at the HIV clinic of MRRH from February to April 2010. We collected data on patient demographics, clinical characteristics, perceptions of quality of care received, self-perceived health status, information on ART received, herbal medicines use and ART adherence. Study outcomes were concomitant herbal medicine and ART use, and ART adherence. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were conducted using Stata10.0. Close to half, 155 (46.4%) reported concomitant herbal medicines and ART use, with 133 (39.8%) using herbal medicines at least once daily. Most (71.6%) used herbal medicines to treat HIV-related symptoms. A majority (92.3%) reported that the doctors were unaware of their use of herbal medicines, 68.5% citing its minimal importance to the attending physician. Most frequently used herbs were Aloe vera (25%) and Vernonia amygdalina (21%). Time since start of ART (OR 1.14 95% CI: 1.01-1.28, for each one year increase), number of ART side effects reported (≥3 vs.≤1, OR 2.20 95% CI 1.13-4.26) and self-perceived health status (Good vs. Poor, OR 0.31 95% CI 0.12-0.79) were independently associated with concomitant herbal medicine and ART use. Concomitant herbal medicine and ART use was not associated with poor ART adherence (OR 0.85 95% CI 0.47-1.53). There is widespread concomitant herbal medicines and ART use among our patients, with no association to poor ART adherence. Patients appear to use these therapies to complement as opposed to substituting ART."
12639,0.005,3.0000,"With a rising incidence of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients coinfected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there is a need for evidence-based treatment recommendations. There are no randomised trials available and published studies differ with respect to design, patient characteristics and number of patients included, making a comparison between studies difficult. However, it is critical to standardise treatment for this group of patients in order to optimise the outcome of therapy. The Dutch Society for HIV Physicians proposed to write recommendations for the treatment of acute HCV in HIV -coinfected patients. Combination therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin is the preferred regimen initiated preferably within 12 weeks after the diagnosis of acute HCV. A treatment duration of 24 weeks is recommended in case of a favourable virological response (either achievement of a rapid virological response or a > 2 log10 decrease plus undetectable HCV-RNA at week 12). In all other patients prolonging the duration of therapy to 48 weeks should be considered."
6292,0.005,3.0000,"In Vietnam, premature mortality due to AIDS-related conditions is commonly associated with late initiation to antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study explores reasons for late ART initiation among people living with HIV (PLHIV) from the perspectives of health care providers and PLHIV. The study was undertaken in six clinics from five provinces in Vietnam. Baseline CD4 counts were collected from patient records and grouped into three categories: very late initiators (≤100 cells/mm(3) CD4), late initiators (100-200 cells/mm(3)) and timely initiators (200-350 cells/mm(3)). Thirty in-depth interviews with patients who started ART and 15 focus group discussions with HIV service providers were conducted and thematic analysis of the content performed. Of 934 patients, 62% started ART very late and 11% initiated timely treatment. The proportion of patients for whom a CD4 count was obtained within six months of their HIV diagnosis ranged from 22% to 72%. The proportion of patients referred to ART clinics by voluntary testing and counselling centres ranged from 1% to 35%. Structural barriers to timely ART initiation were poor linkage between HIV testing and HIV care and treatment services, lack of patient confidentiality and a shortage of HIV/AIDS specialists. If Vietnam's treatment practice is to align with WHO recommendations then the connection between voluntary counselling and testing service and ART clinics must be improved. Expansion and decentralization of HIV/AIDS services to allow implementation at the community level increased task sharing between doctors and nurses to overcome limited human resources, and improved patient confidentiality are likely to increase timely access to HIV treatment services for more patients."

Nineteen patients were enrolled into the study in which ddI monotherapy (200 mg p.o.b.i.d.) was administered for the first 4 weeks, followed by the coadministration of ribavirin (600 mg p.o.q.d.) and ddI (200 mg p.o.b.i.d.) for 8 or 20 additional weeks. The combination regimen was safe and well tolerated. Three patients did not complete 12 weeks of the study because of adverse events or voluntary withdrawal. The pharmacokinetic studies performed at weeks 4, 6, and 12 on specimens collected from the 15 individuals who completed 12 weeks of therapy revealed no pharmacokinetic interaction between ddI and ribavirin. A significant decline from baseline in HIV-1 titer as measured by quantitative HIV-1 culture was detected both during the ddI-monotherapy phase (week 4, p < 0.001) and during the combination-therapy ddI + ribavirin phase (week 12, p < 0.001); the median drop observed was 0.90 log10 at week 4 and 0.92 log10 at week 12. While the addition of ribavirin did not result in further reductions in viremia in the following weeks on study treatment, 13 (81%) of the 16 patients had at least a -0.5 log10 change in viral titer at week 12. The median decline in plasma viral RNA was 0.68 log10 at week 4(p < 0.001) and 0.67 log10 at week 12 (p = 0.005). CD4+ cell counts increased above baseline significantly during the ddI-monotherapy phase of the study (p = 0.0038). The median increase was +26 cells/mm3 at week 4 and +11 cells/mm3 at week 12; for patients who remained on treatment through 24 weeks, the median CD4+ cell count increase was +10 cells/mm3. The L74V ddI resistance-conferring HIV-I reverse-transcriptase mutation emerged in 53% of the patients. Patients with non-syncytium-inducing HIV variants demonstrated greater responses to treatment with larger decreases in virus load and greater increases in CD4+ cell count. Our results reveal that the combination of ddI and ribavirin in HIV-positive patients is safe, well tolerated, without adverse pharmacologic interaction, and associated with significant and sustained declines in virus load over 12 weeks of therapy."
16008,0.005,3.0000,"Use of alcohol and illicit drugs is a common finding among HIV-infected individuals, but there are many open questions about its impact on adherence to antiretroviral therapy and virological outcomes. Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of the use of alcohol and illicit drugs on the adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among patients starting ART in Salvador, Brazil. We followed up 144 AIDS patients initiating ART for a 6-month period. At baseline, they were interviewed about demographics, behavior, and use of illicit drugs and alcohol. All of them had HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load and CD4(+)/CD8(+) cells count measured before starting therapy. After 60 days of treatment they were asked to answer a new questionnaire on adherence to ART. All patients were monitored during the following months, and new CD4(+) cell count/HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load determinations were performed after 6 months of therapy. Optimal adherence to therapy was defined by self-reported questionnaire, by 95% use of prescribed drug doses, and by using plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load as a biological marker. A total of 61 (42.4%) patients reported alcohol use, 7 (4.9%) used illicit drugs, and 17 (11.8%) used both alcohol and illicit drugs. Being in a steady relationship was protective to nonadherence (95% CI: 0.18-0.84). Missing more than two medical visits was also associated with a 68% higher likelihood of nonadherence (95% CI: 0.10-1.02). After logistic regression we detected a higher risk of nonadherence for patients declaring use of alcohol plus illicit drugs (odds ratio=6.0; 95% CI: 1.78-20.28) or high-intensity use of alcohol (odds ratio=3.29; 95% CI: 1.83-5.92). AIDS patients using alcohol and/or illicit drugs are socially vulnerable, and need specific and flexible programs, combining mental health care, harm reduction strategies, and assisted drug therapy to maximize the chances of successful use of ART."
15954,0.005,3.0000,"The authors tested the impact of social instability on adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among patients infected with HIV through injection drug use (IDU; MANIF2000 cohort). In the study, they analyzed sociodemographic baseline characteristics to develop an indicator of social instability. Information concerning adherence to HAART was collected through questionnaires during a 2-year follow-up period. Factors associated with nonadherence were studied in two different groups: 1) patients who had stopped injection drug use (ex-IDUs) and who were not in drug maintenance programs (DMT) during the entire follow-up period, and 2) those who were still opiate dependent. Among the 210 eligible patients, 114 were classified as ex-IDUs and 96 as opiate dependent. Ex-IDUs reported nonadherence behaviors in 96 of 384 visits (25.0%), while opiate-dependent patients were nonadherent in 111 of 308 visits (36.0%; p = .02). Among ex-IDUs, the only factor associated with nonadherence was social instability, while among opiate-dependent patients, injection behavior was the only determinant of nonadherence behavior. For opiate-dependent patients, DMT may enhance adherence to HAART, but only if it is successful in reducing abuse of injection practices. For ex-IDUs, it is very important that the management of social difficulties be taken into account to increase adherence to HAART."

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors of severe weight loss (> or =10%) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) / HCV-coinfected patients participating in a randomized, controlled 48-week trial comparing peg-IFN alpha 2b plus ribavirin with IFN alpha-2b plus ribavirin. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify links with antiretroviral treatments, anti-HCV therapy and clinical and laboratory findings. One hundred eleven (28.9%) of 383 patients who received at least one dose of anti-HCV treatment subsequently had severe weight loss. Among patients who took at least 80% of the planned total dose, severe weight loss occurred in 74 patients (32.7%). In multivariate analysis, age >40 years [hazard ratio (HR), 1.59; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.31; P = 0.016], body mass index (BMI) >22 (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.16 to 2.55; P = 0.0069), peg-IFN alpha-2b (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.69; P = 0.0022) and female sex (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.43; P = 0.027) were associated with severe weight loss. In contrast, patients taking non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)-containing antiretroviral regimens were less likely to lose weight (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.96; P = 0.034). Lipodystrophy tended to occur more frequently in patients who had severe weight loss than in the other patients (26.1%vs 17.6%; P = 0.0682) and patients whose weight loss >5% persisted 24 weeks after the completion of anti-HCV therapy (n = 58 / 111) were more likely to be receiving stavudine-based antiretroviral therapy, suggesting that mitochondrial toxicity plays some role in weight loss. These findings show that severe weight loss is a frequent side effect of anti-HCV therapy in HIV / HCV-coinfected patients. The underlying mechanisms remain to be identified."
6203,0.005,3.0000,"The safety, antiretroviral activity, and pharmacokinetic profile of nelfinavir, a potent and specific inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease, were assessed in a small open-label phase I/II dose-ranging study in protease inhibitor-naive HIV-positive men. A total of 22 patients with baseline plasma HIV RNA > or = 20,000 copies/mL and CD4+ counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm3 were enrolled in the study. Of the 22 patients, 20 were evaluated for activity; 10 patients assigned to 771 mg/day base equivalent (300 mg three times daily) and 10 patients assigned to 1,026 mg/day base equivalent (600 mg twice daily) given monotherapy. A capsule formulation of nelfinavir was used. The initial study period was 28 days; patients showing a virologic response of 1 log10 reduction were eligible for enrollment in an extension phase and addition of nucleoside analogues. A maximally tolerated dose of nelfinavir was not established. A dose-response relationship was observed for four (40%) patients in the 771-mg group and six (60%) patients in the 1,026-mg group experiencing a reduction from baseline in plasma HIV RNA of at lest 1 log during the 28-day study. Of these patients, five sustained the reduction in plasma HIV RNA beyond day 28 (2 patients receiving 771 mg/day and 3 patients receiving 1,026 mg/day). Median increases from baseline in CD4+ counts at day 28 were 216 cell/mm3 and 86 cell/mm3 in the 771-mg and 1,026-mg groups, respectively. After oral administration, median nelfinavir plasma concentrations on day 28 reached a maximum at 1 hour (2,966 ng/mL) in the 771-mg group and at 3 hours (3,157 ng/mL) in the 1,026-mg group. Data for 22 patients were included in the safety analysis; 12 patients (55%) reported at least one grade 2 or worse (moderate, severe, or very severe) adverse event. The most common grade 2 or worse adverse event was diarrhea, reported by two patients (20%) receiving 771 mg/day and seven patients (70%) receiving 1,026 mg/day; followed by nausea, flatulence, asthenia, and headache (each reported in 1 patient [10%] in the 771-mg group) and dizziness (reported in 1 patient [10%] receiving 1,026 mg/day). In the small subgroup (n = 6) who continued taking nelfinavir for longer periods (between 8 and 15 months), virologic responses were sustained in the majority of patients with good tolerability. Nelfinavir is an active HIV-protease inhibitor with favorable pharmacokinetics, good tolerability, and sustained antiviral effects. Results of this early phase I/II dose-ranging study provided data for the safety and antiretroviral activity of nelfinavir and led to the selection of higher doses for phase II/III trials to further optimize virologic and immunologic responses."
19530,0.005,3.0000,"Reports of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission associated with unsafe medical practices have been increasing in the United States. However, the contribution of healthcare exposures to the burden of new infections is poorly understood outside of recognized outbreaks. We conducted a case-control study at three health departments that perform enhanced viral hepatitis surveillance in New York and Oregon. Reported cases of symptomatic acute hepatitis B and hepatitis C occurring in persons≥55 years of age from 2006 to 2008 were enrolled. Controls were identified using telephone directories and matched to individual cases by age group (55-59, 60-69, and ≥70 years) and residential postal code. Data collection covered exposures within 6 months before symptom onset (cases) or date of interview (controls). Forty-eight (37 hepatitis B and 11 hepatitis C) case and 159 control patients were enrolled. Case patients were more likely than controls to report one or more behavioral risk exposures, including sexual or household contact with an HBV or HCV patient, >1 sex partner, illicit drug use, or incarceration (21% of cases versus 4% of controls exposed; matched odds ratio [mOR]=7.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.1, 24.1). Case patients were more likely than controls to report hemodialysis (8% of cases; mOR=13.0; 95% CI: 1.5, 115), injections in a healthcare setting (58%; mOR=2.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.3), and surgery (33%; mOR=2.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.7). In a multivariate model, behavioral risks (adjusted OR [aOR]=5.4; 95% CI: 1.5, 19.0; 17% attributable risk), injections (aOR=2.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.8; 37% attributable risk), and hemodialysis (aOR=11.5; 95% CI: 1.2, 107; 8% attributable risk) were associated with case status."
1167,0.005,3.0000,"Although cirrhosis is a known risk factor for gallstones, little is known about gallbladder disease (GBD) in individuals with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We determined the association between chronic HCV infection and GBD in a representative sample of adults in the United States. Data on HCV infection and GBD were available for 13,465 persons 20 to 74 years of age who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The presence of GBD (gallstones or cholecystectomy) was determined using abdominal ultrasonography, and HCV infection was assessed via a positive HCV antibody test and a positive HCV RNA test. Overall, 1.6% of adults (95% CI, 1.1-2.1) had chronic HCV infection and 12.5% (95% CI, 11.3-13.7) had GBD. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, the odds of gallstones (OR = 3.20; 95% CI, 1.08-9.45) and cholecystectomy (OR = 4.57; 95% CI, 1.57-13.27) among HCV-positive men was significantly higher compared with HCV-negative men. In contrast, the adjusted odds of gallstones (OR = 2.55; 95% CI, 0.58-11.25) and cholecystectomy (OR = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.21-2.37) among HCV-positive women was not significantly higher. The odds of GBD increased significantly with the severity of liver disease as assessed via elevated serum bilirubin levels and low levels of serum albumin and platelets. In conclusion, chronic HCV infection was strongly associated with GBD among men but not women in the United States, and GBD was more common in adults with severe liver disease."
12596,0.005,3.0000,"To estimate the effect of hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection on the development of complications and progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease among HIV-infected elite controllers.Single-center retrospective cohort. Kaplan-Meier methods, prevalence ratios, and Cox proportional-hazards models were used.In all, 55 HIV-infected elite controllers were included in this study. Among them, 45% were HIV/HCV coinfected and 55% were HIV mono-infected. Median follow-up time for the cohort was 11 years. Twenty-five patients experienced a complication and 16 lost elite controller status during the study period. HCV coinfected patients were 4.78 times (95% confidence interval 1.50-15.28) more likely to develop complications compared with HIV mono-infected patients. There was no association between HCV coinfection status and loss of elite control (hazard ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.27-2.06).Hepatitis C virus coinfection was significantly associated with the risk of complications even after controlling for sex, injecting drug use, and older age. HCV coinfected patients had higher levels of cellular activation while also having similar levels of lipopolysaccharide and soluble CD14. HCV coinfection was not associated with loss of elite controller status. Taken together, this suggests that HCV coinfection does not directly affect HIV replication dynamics or natural history, but that it may act synergistically with HIV to produce a greater number of associated complications. Continued follow-up will be needed to determine whether HCV cure through the use of direct-acting antivirals among HIV/HCV coinfected elite controllers will make the risk for complications among these patients similar to their HIV mono-infected counterparts."
8402,0.005,3.0000,"The objectives of this study is to clarify whether there are phases critical for the infection of the central nervous system (CNS) as defined by active viral replication in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. One hundred and nine HIV-1-positive homo- and bisexual patients in early and late disease stages with or without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were included in the cross-sectional, diagnostic (phase I) multicenter study. No patients had any overt neurological deficits; all underwent venous and lumbar puncture as well as neuropsychological testing. In untreated early-stage patients, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral load correlated with inflammatory parameters, but not significantly with neuropsychological abnormalities. CSF viral load and inflammatory reactions were suppressed in HAART-treated early-stage patients. In HAART-treated late-stage patients, there was a weak correlation between CSF viral load and CSF cell count as well as a moderate correlation with immune activation markers and with distinct cerebral deficits independent of CSF viral load. Seventeen of the 109 patients had higher CSF than plasma viral loads and marked inflammatory reactions and immune activation. In patients with greater plasma than CSF viral loads, the factors contributing to cerebral deficits still need to be identified. The results suggest not only that there is an early ""set point"" for CSF/central nervous system (CNS) infection, but also that there is a subgroup of patients in whom intrathecal viral replication correlates with cerebral deficits. Lumbar puncture should be performed in all positive patients to identify members of this subgroup and to ascertain what characteristic factors they have in common in order to improve therapy."
1718,0.005,3.0000,"The objectives of this research were to assess prevalence and predictors of early antiretroviral therapy adherence using multiple indicators and to estimate effects of early adherence on subsequent HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte responses. Study subjects were adults with HIV infection referred to an antiretroviral therapy-monitoring clinic for initiation or change in therapy between March 1998 and June 1999. The design was a prospective observational cohort involving baseline interview followed by 30 days of electronic adherence monitoring (MEMS), 30-day interview, and follow-up viral load at 1, 3, and 6 months. Adherence indicators included MEMS therapeutic coverage, observed/expected cap openings, and self-reported adherence assessed at 30 days. Of 235 consenting patients, 60 (26%) failed to complete 30 days of electronic monitoring (noncompleters). At 6 months, mean change from baseline plasma viral load was inferior among noncompleters (0.5 log vs. 1.7 log). Predictors of adherence, varying by adherence metric, included: gender, race, prior antiretroviral therapy experience, substance abuse, prior adherence behavior, health beliefs, and pharmacist prediction of adherence. Self-reported adherence was more sensitive in predicting viral load responses than MEMS-based measures and identified poor adherence at earlier time points. Approximately a quarter of consenting patients were unable to complete 30 days of MEMS monitoring, and early drop out was a poor prognostic sign. Predictors of adherence varied depending upon how adherence was measured. Differences in virologic response between patients with optimal or poor adherence may not emerge until several months after regimen change or initiation. Structured assessment of self-reported adherence is an inexpensive and useful tool to assist clinicians in monitoring adherence."
18928,0.005,3.0000,"Studies from sub-Saharan Africa indicate that children made vulnerable by poverty have been disproportionately affected by HIV with many exposed via mother-to-child transmission. For youth living with HIV, adherence to life-saving treatment regimens are likely to be affected by the complex set of economic and social circumstances that challenge their families and also exacerbate health problems. Using baseline data from the National Institute of Child and Human Development (NICHD) funded Suubi+Adherence study, we examined the extent to which individual and composite measures of equity predict self-reported adherence among Ugandan adolescents aged 10-16 (n = 702) living with HIV. Results showed that greater asset ownership, specifically familial possession of seven or more tangible assets, was associated with greater odds of self-reported adherence (OR 1.69, 95% CI: 1.00-2.85). Our analyses also indicated that distance to the nearest health clinic impacts youth's adherence to an ARV regimen. Youth who reported living nearest to a clinic were significantly more likely to report optimal adherence (OR 1.49, 95% CI: 0.92-2.40). Moreover, applying the composite equity scores, we found that adolescents with greater economic advantage in ownership of household assets, financial savings, and caregiver employment had higher odds of adherence by a factor of 1.70 (95% CI: 1.07-2.70). These findings suggest that interventions addressing economic and social inequities may be beneficial to increase antiretroviral therapy (ART) uptake among economically vulnerable youth, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This is one of the first studies to address the question of equity in adherence to ART among economically vulnerable youth with HIV."

The aim of this study was to examine the associations between adherence and severity of substance use as well as adherence and severity of depressive symptoms among Iranian HIV patients. In a prospective study, HIV patients with current substance use were assessed for adherence level via self report and pill count methods, severity of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory- II) and substance use (Addiction Severity Index) during a three months follow up after initiating antiretroviral therapy. The adherence level, severity of depressive symptoms and substance use were assessed one month, two months and three months after initiation of anti-retroviral therapy. Addiction Severity Index (ASI) composite scores were calculated for each domain and the associations between ASI domains and adherence as well as severity of depressive symptoms and adherence were assessed. Twenty six HIV patients with current substance use disorder completed the study. At the end of the first month, adherence to therapy via pill count and self-report were 80%±31.9% and 85.12%±32%, respectively. At the end of the second month, adherence to therapy via pill count and self report were 87%±32% and 93.94%±23% respectively. At the end of the third month, the measured adherence via pill count and self report were 85%±33.7% and 90.1%±25.7% respectively. Adherence was higher among married patients and those who used reminder systems. Composite scores of the medical status and psychiatric status were related to higher adherence after first month. Substance use was inversely associated with adherence at the second follow up (r=-0.4, p=0.04). Also, severity of depressive symptoms was not related to adherence level. The repeated measurement analysis showed a significant decrease in psychiatric status domain of the ASI composite score after three months of initiating therapy (p=0.02). Preventive measures should aim treatment of substance use among HIV patients in order to increase adherence level. Also, conducting psychological evaluations is necessary considering the high prevalence of depression among Iranian HIV patients. "

We investigated the associations between genital HIV-1 suppression after ART initiation and adherence, resistance, pretreatment CD4 cell count, and hormonal contraceptive use. First-line ART was initiated in 102 women. Plasma and genital HIV-1 RNA levels were measured at months 0, 3, and 6. Adherence was a strong and consistent predictor of genital HIV-1 suppression (P < .001), whereas genotypic resistance was associated with higher vaginal HIV-1 RNA level at month 6 (P = .04). These results emphasize the importance of adherence to optimize the potential benefits of ART for reducing HIV-1 transmission risk."

Immigration and globalization have added to the challenges of public health concerns regarding chronic HBV and HCV infections worldwide. The aim of this study is to review existing global literature across ethnic populations on HBV and HCV related human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations in relation to susceptibility, viral persistence and treatment. Extensive literature search was conducted to explore the HLA associations in HBV and HCV infections reported across global populations over the past decade to understand the knowledge status, weaknesses and strengths of this information in different ethnic populations. HLA DR13 is consistently associated with HBV clearance globally. HLADRB1*11/*12 alleles and DQB1*0301 are associated with HBV persistence but with HCV clearance worldwide. Consistent association of DRB1*03 and *07 is observed with HCV susceptibility and non-responsiveness to HBV vaccination across the population. HLA DR13 is protective for vertical HBV and HCV transmission in Chinese and Italian neonates, but different alleles are associated with their susceptibility in these populations. HLA class I molecule interactions with Killer cell immunoglobulin like receptors (KIR) of natural killer (NK) cells modulate HCV infection outcome via regulating immune regulatory cells and molecules. HLA associations with HBV vaccination, interferon therapy in HBV and HCV, and with extra hepatic manifestations of viral hepatitis are also discussed. Systematic studies in compliance with global regulatory standards are required to identify the HLA specific viral epitope, stage specific T cell populations interacting with different HLA alleles during disease progression and viral clearance of chronic HBV or HCV infections among different ethnic populations. These studies would facilitate stage specific therapeutic strategies for clearance of HBV and HCV infections or co-infections across global populations and aid in identification of HBV-HCV combined vaccine. HLA associations of chronic HBV or HCV development with confounding host factors including alcohol, drug abuse, insulin resistance, age and gender are lacking and warrant detailed investigation across global populations."
7539,0.005,3.0000,"Individuals at risk of HIV are concomitantly at risk of acquiring parenterally or sexually transmitted viruses, including HBV and HCV. After the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART), liver disease has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected persons. HBV, HCV and HIV share common routes of transmission, but the differential efficiency of these viruses to the types of exposures underlies difference in their prevalence by geographic region. Coinfection alters the natural history of each of these viruses in a peculiar way; furthermore coinfection with viral hepatitis may complicate the delivery of ART by increasing the risk of drug-related hepatoxicity and impacting the selection of specific agents (e.g., those dually active against HIV and HBV). The treatment of HBV in HIV co-infection is complex because the drug(s) used is/are associated with drug-resistance, cross-resistance, hepatotoxicity and suboptimal response. The aim is to achieve long-term sustained viral (HBV) suppression. HBV should be treated in coinfected patients with elevated HBV DNA or significant hepatic fibrosis (Metavir score = A2 or F2). The HBV DNA threshold for initiation of HBV treatment should be lower than in patients with HBV monoinfection. Anti HBV therapy should also be considered in those receiving ART irrespective of viral load and fibrosis, in order to prevent hepatitis of immune reconstitution. Selection of drug(s) depends on whether coinfected patients require treatment of only HBV or both HBV and HIV. In patients requiring only HBV treatment, drugs with dual antiviral activity should not be used in order to avoid early HIV resistance. When both HIV and HBV meet criteria for the treatment, agents with dual activity should be included in the anti-retroviral regimen. Treatment should be monitored by measuring the ALT and HBV DNA levels 3 to 6 monthly. The required duration of HBV treatment in coinfected induviduals is not known and may possibly be life long. Every coinfected person with compensated chronic HCV should be considered for HCV treatment. However, treatment should be avoided in decompensated cirrhosis and in the presence of active opportunistic infection. In patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/il and/or plasma HIV-RNA above 100,000 copies/mI, it may be better to consider anti HIV treatment before HCV treatment. The standard treatment in coinfected patients is pegylated interferon alfa-2a (Pegasys) or -2b (Peg-Intron) plus ribavirin for 48 weeks. Several studies have shown an overall sustained vwal response rate of 14% to 29% in genotype 1 and 53% to 73% in genotypes 2 and 3. The other concern with treatment is drug interaction with anti retroviral drugs necessitating avoidance of certain drugs from ART regimen. The coinfected persons with decompensated liver cirrhosis should not be denied HAART and should be evaluated for liver transplantation. Finally, management of patients not responding to standared therapy is not known."
10198,0.005,3.0000,"The interaction between limited resources, living in conflict areas, and complexity of HIV treatment may impact negatively on adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Nonadherence may lead to development of resistant strains that may further increase the costs of management. The aim of this study was to compare the level of adherence to ART among internally displaced persons (IDPs) and non-IDPs and determine the factors associated with nonadherence. A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to February 2008 among adults receiving ART from Lacor Hospital. Systematic sampling was used to select 200 participants. Adherence was assessed through patients' self-reports over a 4-day period. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and analyzed in SPSS version 12 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Patients were considered to be adherent if they took 95% or more of their medicines. Adherence rates among IDP and non-IDP patients were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Factors associated with nonadherence were determined using logistic regression. The overall mean 4-day adherence was 99.5%. There was no significant difference in adherence between IDPs and non-IDPs (99.6% and 99.5%, respectively). Being on first-line regimen of ART (odds ratio [OR] = 22.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.48-333.33) and feeling that staff at the health centre were condemning (OR = 22.22, 1.53-333.33) were independently associated with nonadherence. Our study was limited in using only self-reports to assess adherence. In conclusion, patients in conflict areas can achieve high levels of adherence. Interventions to reduce nonadherence should address health provider-patient interaction and patients on first-line regimens."

Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) co-infection is prevalent in, and worsened by HIV; consequently many co-infected persons require liver transplantation (LT). Despite the need, post-LT outcomes are poor in co-infection. We examined predictors of outcomes post-LT. Immunologic biomarkers of immune activation, microbial translocation, and Th1/Th2 skewing were measured pre-LT in participants enrolled in a cohort of HIV infected persons requiring solid organ transplant (HIVTR). Predictive biomarkers were analyzed in Cox-proportional hazards models; multivariate models included known predictors of outcome and biomarkers from univariate analyses. Sixty-nine HIV-HCV co-infected persons with available pre-LT samples were tested: median (IQR) CD4+ T-cell count was 286 (210-429) cells mm-3; 6 (9%) had detectable HIV RNA. Median (IQR) follow-up was 2.1 (0.7-4.0) years, 29 (42%) people died, 35 (51%) had graft loss, 22 (32%) were treated for acute rejection, and 14 (20%) had severe recurrent HCV. In multivariate models, sCD14 levels were significantly lower in persons with graft loss post-LT (HR 0.10 [95%CI 0.02-0.68]). IL-10 levels were higher in persons with rejection (HR 2.10 [95%CI 1.01-4.34]). No markers predicted severe recurrent HCV. Monocyte activation pre-LT may be mechanistically linked to graft health in HIV-HCV co-infection."

HIV-1 transmission occurred in 49 of 201 mother-infant sets, yielding an overall transmission rate of 24.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 18.7% to 31.0%). Increased frequency of vaginal intercourse after the first trimester of pregnancy was positively associated with vertical transmission of HIV-1 (trend p = 0.03). A lifetime history of injection drug use was not associated with vertical transmission. However, a history of combined cocaine and heroin injection after the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with vertical HIV-1 transmission, particularly among women with CD4+ lymphocyte levels of 20% or higher (risk ratio = 4.0; 95% CI = 2.0 to 8.1). Cocaine and heroin injection drug use after the first trimester accounted for most of the relation between preterm birth and vertical HIV-1 transmission in this cohort. Maternal coinfection with hepatitis C virus or human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II could not explain these observations, because coinfection with these viruses had no detectable effect on HIV-1 transmission. These results suggest that maternal sexual behavior and injection drug use practices during the second and third trimester of pregnancy may modify the risk of vertical HIV-1 transmission."
14379,0.005,3.0000,"We obtained data from 111 gay men who entered a longitudinal study of the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) without clinical evidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and examined them regularly over a 36-month period. Using a Cox proportional-hazard regression model to compare cumulative risk of mortality in subjects with and without cognitive impairment and several putative risk factors present at baseline, we found that the mortality risk ratio (RR) associated with poor neuropsychologic test performance was significantly increased (RR = 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 7.8), and increased further (RR = 4.1; 95% CI, 1.3 to 12.5) when adjusted for other factors associated with mortality (a history of a disturbance in movement or gait, CD4-lymphocyte and red blood-cell counts, and age). A significant increase in symptoms related to cognitive impairment and gait, a decline in neuropsychologic test performance, and declines in CD4-lymphocyte and red-cell counts occurred over the study period. A second model was constructed to adjust for changes in CD4-lymphocyte and red-cell counts, age, medical stage, and motor symptoms over the study period, but the mortality RR for poor neuropsychologic test performance at baseline changed very little (RR = 4.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 14.9). We conclude that the presence of cognitive impairment, manifest by poor neuropsychologic test performance in both asymptomatic and symptomatic gay men with HIV infection, is associated with a significantly increased risk of death. This effect progresses in parallel with the immunologic and systemic effects of HIV."
11810,0.005,3.0000,"In a background of very high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among women of childbearing age and the increasing demand for treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission, we investigated the desire for a future pregnancy among women in Zimbabwe in relation to (1) self-perceived risk of HIV infection, (2) child mortality, and (3) spontaneous abortion. A random cross-sectional sample of 2250 ever-married women aged 15-49 years was selected from 6,828 households in rural and urban Zimbabwe. The sample was representative of the geographic distribution of women. One eligible subject was selected per household for a structured interview on factors associated with the desire for future pregnancy. Overall, 54% of the participants desired to get pregnant in future; 55% perceived themselves at high risk for HIV infection; 6% reported the death of at least one child less than the age of 5 years in the last 5 years; and 12% reported at least one spontaneous abortion in the last 5 years. In multiple logistic regression analysis, reporting at least one child's death (OR = 1.77; 95% CI 1.13-2.78) and at least one spontaneous abortion in the last 5 years (OR = 1.81; 95% CI 1.08-3.04) were significantly associated with a higher desire to get pregnant; however, high self-perceived risk for HIV infection was not (OR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.67-1.09). High self-perceived risk for infection with HIV was not associated with a lower desire for a future pregnancy among women in Zimbabwe in a high-prevalence area. In fact, our data suggest an increased desire for future pregnancy to replace childhood deaths or spontaneous abortions that may result from HIV infection. Voluntary HIV testing services are challenged with balancing counseling messages on the strong desire for children, the risk of mother-to-child transmission, and poor fetal outcomes. Further research is needed to explore utilitarian-economic, social, and psychological values attributed to children by women and their partners. The involvement of men as partners in childbearing should be explored, as their desire for children may be the primary barrier to protective behavior change among women."
14186,0.005,3.0000,"Available evidence suggests that young former Soviet Union immigrants in New York City have high rates of non-medical prescription opioid and heroin use, drug injection and injection-related risk behavior, making them vulnerable to hepatitis C virus (HCV)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, overdose and associated harms. This group has been the focus of little research, however. This paper presents quantitative and qualitative data from 80 former Soviet immigrants (ages 18-29) to characterize their opioid use trajectories, injection risk behavior, HCV/HIV testing histories and self-reported HCV/HIV serostatus, and provides clinically meaningful data to inform tailored education, prevention and harm reduction interventions.

11299,0.005,3.0000,"African men who have sex with men (MSM) face significant stigma and barriers to care. We investigated antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among high-risk adults, including MSM, participating in a clinic-based cohort. Survival analysis was used to compare attrition across patient groups. Differences in adherence, weight gain, and CD4 counts after ART initiation were assessed. Among 250 HIV-1-seropositive adults, including 108 MSM, 15 heterosexual men, and 127 women, patient group was not associated with attrition. Among 58 participants who were followed on ART, 40 % of MSM had less than 95 % adherence, versus 28.6 % of heterosexual men and 11.5 % of women. Although MSM gained less weight after ART initiation than women (adjusted difference -3.5 kg/year), CD4 counts did not differ. More data are needed on barriers to adherence and clinical outcomes among African MSM, to ensure that MSM can access care and derive treatment and prevention benefits from ART."
11880,0.005,3.0000,"This pilot study assessed the determinants of engagement in HIV care among Zambian patients new to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, and the effect of an intervention to increase medication adherence. Participants (n = 160) were randomized to a 3-month group or individual intervention utilizing a crossover design. Psychophysiological (depression, cognitive functioning, health status), social (social support, disclosure, stigma), structural factors (health care access, patient-provider communication), and treatment engagement (adherence to clinic visits and medication) were assessed. Participants initially receiving the group intervention improved their adherence, but gains were not maintained following crossover to the individual intervention. Increased social support and patient-provider communication and decreased concern about HIV medications predicted increased clinic attendance across both arms. Results suggest that early participation in a group intervention may promote increased adherence among patients new to ARV therapy, but long-term engagement in care may be sustained by both one-on-one and group interventions by health care staff."
4130,0.005,3.0000,"Previous research suggested that the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) was associated with increased risky sexual behavior. This study examined the relationship between unprotected anal or vaginal sex (UAV) and ART use and adherence in a cross-sectional survey conducted in 874 randomly selected, sexually active patients at 6 public HIV clinics in California. Patients completed a standardized interview in 1998-1999 regarding HIV history, sexual behavior, illicit drug use, and ART use and adherence. Thirty-four percent reported UAV, defined as anal or vaginal sex without a condom within the past 3 months. Of 79% on ART, 26% reported <95% adherence. Decreased odds for UAV were found for both ART use, odds ratio (OR) 0.5 (95% CI 0.4-0.7, P < 0.001) and adherence to ART of > or = 95%, OR 0.6 (95% CI 0.4-0.8, P < 0.001). These relationships persisted in most stratified analysis for both ART use and adherence but in multivariate analysis only for ART use. An undetectable HIV RNA was associated with decreased odds of UAV, OR 0.6 (95% CI 0.5-0.8, P < 0.001). Contrary to expectations, use of and adherence to ART and their consequent suppression of HIV were associated with a decreased prevalence of self-reported risky sexual behavior."
8482,0.005,3.0000,"(1) HIV-infected patients appear to be at an increased risk of complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. (2) Treatments for hepatitis C have been assessed in four open-label randomised controlled trials involving more than 1500 HIV-infected patients. Only virological endpoints were assessed. Patients with low CD4 lymphocyte counts were excluded, and few patients had cirrhosis. (3) Only one of these trials compared ribavirin versus placebo in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a. The addition of ribavirin increased the antiviral efficacy of interferon: 40% of the patients receiving ribavirin had no detectable virus at 24 weeks after the end of treatment versus 12% of patients in the placebo group. (4) The four trials compared peginterferon alfa-2 (a or b) with interferon alfa-2 (a or b) in combination with ribavirin. The results of the four trials were similar: overall, significantly more patients infected with HCV genotype 1, 2, or 3 on peginterferon alfa-2 (26-44%) than on standard interferon alfa-2 (18-21%) had no detectable virus at 24 weeks. However, treatment was more effective in patients infected with genotype 2 or 3 (44-62% of patients without detectable virus) than in patients infected with genotype 1 (17-29%). These results appear to be less favourable than those obtained in other studies of HIV-seronegative patients. (5) In the short term, virological efficacy seems to be associated with a lower frequency of histological progression, but this is based on an analysis of only half the patients enrolled in a single trial. (6) The proportion of withdrawals for adverse events with peginterferon alfa-2 + ribavirin treatment ranged from 4% to 15%, depending on the trial. (7) The CD4 cell count fell by about 140/mm3 on average during peginterferon alfa-2a + ribavirin therapy. One patient died after a particularly sharp drop. (8) Treatment of hepatitis C appears to increase the risk of lactic acidosis associated with antiretroviral drugs (especially didanosine). (9) In practice, HIV/HCV coinfected patients treated for hepatitis C must receive close clinical and laboratory monitoring, and the individual risk-benefit balance must be regularly assessed. Clinical trial data available in early 2005 do not show whether the benefits of treatment for hepatitis C outweigh the risks in patients with mild hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, or a low CD4 cell count."
13025,0.005,3.0000,"Studies of heterosexual HIV transmission have consistently found anal intercourse to be a highly predictive risk factor for seroconversion. Yet most AIDS prevention messages targeted at heterosexuals, presumably influenced by cultural taboos against acknowledging this sexual practice, continue to emphasize vaginal and, increasingly, oral sex transmission. The health risks of anal sex appear to be severely underestimated by a substantial proportion of sexually active women and men in North and Latin America as well as parts of South Asia, Africa, and other regions. Among heterosexuals reported rates of condom use are nearly universally lower for anal than for vaginal intercourse. This review examines anal sex among the general population, including its prevalence in various world regions, related sociocultural factors, and other associated health problems including anorectal STDs, Hepatitis B infection, and HPV-related anal cancer in women. U.S. survey and other data suggest that, in terms of absolute numbers, approximately seven times more women than homosexual men engage in unprotected receptive anal intercourse. Research among higher risk subpopulations, including bisexual men, injecting drug users, female sex workers, inner-city adolescents, and serodiscordant heterosexual couples, indicates that persons particularly at risk of being infected by or transmitting HIV are also more likely to practice anal sex. Considering this finding, along with the much greater efficiency for HIV infection as well as lower rates of condom usage, a significant proportion of heterosexual transmission in some populations is due to anal intercourse. This typically stigmatized and hidden sexual practice must be given greater emphasis in AIDS/STD prevention, women's care, and other health promotion programs."
5225,0.005,3.0000,"Many HIV-infected individuals do not enter health care until late in the infection course. Despite encouraging earlier testing, this situation has continued for several years. We investigated the prevalence of late presenters and factors associated with late presentation among HIV-infected patients in an Asian regional cohort. This cohort study included HIV-infected patients with their first positive HIV test during 2003-2012 and CD4 count and clinical status data within 3 months of that test. Factors associated with late presentation into care (CD4 count <200 cells/μl or an AIDS-defining event within ±3 months of first positive HIV test) were analyzed in a random effects logistic regression model. Among 3,744 patients, 2,681 (72%) were late presenters. In the multivariable model, older patients were more likely to be late presenters than younger (≤30 years) patients [31-40, 41-50, and ≥51 years: odds ratio (OR) = 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-1.88; OR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.58-2.56; and OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.23-2.31, respectively; all p ≤ 0.001]. Injecting drug users (IDU) were more likely (OR = 2.15, 95% CI 1.42-3.27, p < 0.001) and those with homosexual HIV exposure were less likely (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.35-0.58, p < 0.001) to be late presenters compared to those with heterosexual HIV exposure. Females were less likely to be late presenters (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.36-0.53, p < 0.001). The year of first positive HIV test was not associated with late presentation. Efforts to reduce the patients who first seek HIV care at the late stage are needed. The identified risk factors associated with late presentation should be utilized in formulating targeted public health intervention to improve earlier entry into HIV care."
11345,0.005,3.0000,"End-stage renal diseases (ESRD) are becoming more frequent in HIV-infected patients. In Europe there is little information about HIV-infected patients on dialysis. A cross-sectional multicenter survey in 328 Spanish dialysis units was conducted in 2006. Information from 14,876 patients in dialysis was obtained (81.6% of the Spanish dialysis population). Eighty-one were HIV infected (0.54%; 95% CI, 0.43-0.67), 60 were on hemodialysis, and 21 were on peritoneal dialysis. The mean (range) age was 45 (28-73) years. Seventy-two percent were men and 33% were former drug users. The mean (range) time of HIV infection was 11 (1-27) years and time on dialysis was 4.6 (0.4-25) years. ESRD was due to glomerulonephritis (36%) and diabetes (15%). HIV-associated nephropathy was not reported. Eighty-five percent were on HAART, 76.5% had a CD4 T cell count above 200 cells, and 73% had undetectable viral load. Thirty-nine percent of patients met criteria for inclusion on the renal transplant (RT) waiting list but only 12% were included. Sixty-one percent had HCV coinfection. HCV-coinfected patients had a longer history of HIV, more previous AIDS events, parenteral transmission as the most common risk factor for acquiring HIV infection, and less access to the RT waiting list (p < 0.05). The prevalence of HIV infection in Spanish dialysis units in 2006 was 0.54% HCV coinfection was very frequent (61%) and the percentage of patients included on the Spanish RT waiting list was low (12%)."
16203,0.005,3.0000,"Viral hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are important causes of mortality and morbidity in patients treated by haemodialysis (HD). Both are further promoted by the characteristic immunological dysfunction that develops in renal failure and interferes with the patient's ability to eliminate these viruses. The hepatotropic viruses A through G remain the causative agents in 60 to 80% of hepatitis. But, as far as HD is concerned, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the two most important organisms responsible for almost all the patients' morbidity. In HD, both patients as well as staff are at a high risk of acquiring hepatitis B infection. The prevalence of HBV in the dialysis population in India is reported to range between 3.4% and 42%. The acute course of the infection is often anicteric and peak transaminase concentration is significantly less than in patients with normal renal function. Up to 60% of dialysis patients with HBV infection develop chronic hepatitis with persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and infectivity. The risk of transmission of HBV infection due to blood from one patient to another is mostly because of inadequate precautions taken by the dialysis staff. Combined therapy with interferon (6-10 million units) three times a week and lamivudine (100-300 mg/day) would be more effective in controlling viral replication. The most important modality for prevention of HBV infection is induction of immunity by hepatitis B vaccination. Administration of 40 microg doses at months 0, 1, 2 and 6 is the most rapid immunogenic schedule. The prevalence of HCV in HD patients ranges from 6% in the United Kingdom to 60% in Poland and Eastern Europe, 8-36% in North America. HD patients in different parts of India exhibit high anti-HCV positivity (12.1%, 45.2%, 33.3% and 41.9%) in various studies. The incidence and prevalence of HCV infection among patients on dialysis in developed countries are steadily declining because of (i) reduction in post-transfusion HCV infection, (ii) infection control measures to prevent nosocomial infection. Among HD patients with HCV infection, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) levels are elevated in only 4 to 67% patients who are positive for anti-HCV, in only 12 to 31% patients with HCV RNA and only in one-third of those with biopsy proven hepatitis. Number of blood transfusion, duration of HD treatment, and mode of dialysis are important risk factors. Patient to patient transmission of HCV occurs in HD units by needle stick injury, breakdown in standard infection control practices, physical proximity to an infected patient, dialysis machines, dialysis membranes and HD ultrafiltrate and reprocessing of dialyser. The prevalence of HIV infection in dialysis populations varies according to different countries and geographic areas, 0% and 13% in 1990 and 1995 respectively. There was no evidence of transmission within the centre transmission, from patient to patient or patient to staff. Antiretroviral therapy is the corner-stone of the HIV infection in end stage renal disease (ESRD). Most commonly, zidovudine (AZT) has been used in these patients. Currently recommended dose of 200 mg three times a day is probably safe in these patients."
7971,0.005,3.0000,"In the United States, approximately 30% of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients are also infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Both viruses share similar routes of transmission. Unlike HIV or hepatitis B virus, HCV is curable if treated and the patient achieves a sustained virologic response. The impact of coinfection includes greater morbidity and mortality, with higher rates of opportunistic disease, development of cirrhosis, and death. The standard of treatment for HIV-HCV coinfection is similar to that for HCV monoinfection and consists of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin. As with HCV monoinfection, the best predictor of response to therapy for HIV-HCV coinfection is infection with an HCV genotype other than genotype 1 or 4. Adherence to treatment is critical for improving response to HCV therapy. However, considerable toxicities are associated with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin and pose particular problems in the coinfected patient. Coinfected patients are more likely to experience significant weight loss with HCV therapy. Neutropenia and anemia are both common laboratory abnormalities that necessitate dosage reductions and are concerns for development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining events. The effect of CD4(+) cell count has been evaluated both as a factor in response to HCV therapy and in stratification of risk for infection. Immunosuppression is not a contraindication to HCV therapy, although CD4(+) counts above 350 cells/mm(3) are associated with increased response rates in patients with HCV genotype 1 coinfection. Antiretroviral therapy does need to be adjusted to minimize adverse effects. Concomitant use of zidovudine is contraindicated because of its profound exacerbation of bone marrow suppression. The use of didanosine is also not indicated during HCV therapy because of the risks of hepatic decompensation. Controversy exists regarding the use of abacavir. Newer agents for HCV include the protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir. Although results with the protease inhibitors are highly encouraging, their effects in coinfected patients have not been evaluated. Treatment for HCV in patients with HIV poses potential obstacles to success, but the benefits of viral eradication warrant the challenge of therapy."
3142,0.005,3.0000,"Advances in HIV treatment have generated optimistic beliefs about HIV transmission risk and sexually transmitted infection vulnerability, which can influence motivation to practice safer sex. This study sought to better understand the relationships between these beliefs and different types of sexual risk behavior. A second objective was to determine the association between treatment adherence and sexual risk behaviors. Data collected from 842 HIV-positive men who have sex with men on treatment were examined. Eleven questions measured beliefs regarding HIV transmission risk and vulnerability to other infections or negative health outcomes. The main outcomes were concordant and discordant unprotected anal sex with main and non-main male partners. Thirty-four percent reported concordant and 41% reported discordant unprotected anal sex in the past three months: 26% reported discordant insertive unprotected anal sex. In all multivariate logistic regression models predicting sexual risk behaviors, at least one belief item remained statistically significant. Different patterns of associations between beliefs and sexual risk were observed across partner type and serostatus. Compared to transmission risk beliefs, more vulnerability beliefs were associated with sexual risk. Missing at least one treatment dose in the past month was associated with concordant and discordant sexual risk with non-main partners, while intentionally missing a dose was associated with only discordant risk with non-main partners. Post hoc moderator analysis explored potential interaction between beliefs and adherence. The belief that a low viral load lowers transmission risk was positively associated with discordant sex with non-main partners only among those who missed a dose intentionally. These results underscore the complex relationship between HIV transmission risk and vulnerability beliefs and sexual behavior with different types of partners. Prevention programs should carefully consider how to craft and tailor messages about medical advances while at the same time reinforcing the need for continued sexual safety."

After adjustment for other parameters, baseline HIV RNA level was significantly associated with baseline clinical stage and CD4 cell count. During follow-up (mean, 14.6 months), 16 patients died; 34 others had clinical progression of disease. In multivariate analysis, mortality was better predicted by baseline CD4 cell count (relative hazard [RH] for 100-cell decrease, 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-8.2; P = .003) than by HIV RNA (P = .28) or clinical stage. HIV RNA level was the best predictor of clinical progression (RH for 1 log increase, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.6-4.9; P < .001). Monitoring of HIV RNA level may help to identify patients who might benefit from antiretroviral or prophylactic therapy."
3597,0.005,3.0000,"Chronic kidney disease is an emerging public health issue in Africa. At end-stage renal disease (ESRD), patients need hemodialysis (HD), which may expose them to blood transmitted infections, such as the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest HCV prevalence in the world, but data on HD patients is scarce and shows an exceptionally high rate in Senegal. To assess the efficacy of preventive measures in reducing HCV infection among dialysis patients, we retrospectively conducted a cross-sectional study in three Senegalese HD centers, including all HD patients who performed HCV serology between 1 st and 31 st August 2011. The demographical, clinical, and biological data were collected for each patient. We included 106 patients with a mean age of 43.4±15.8 years (range from 18 to 80 years), with 52.8% males. HD vintage was 60.5±15 months (range from six to 206 months). The main causes of kidney disease included nephrosclerosis (36%) and diabetes (24%). The prevalence of HCV was 5.6%, with one patient co-infected with the hepatitis B virus. After adjusting for age and sex, HD vintage was the only risk factor for HCV infection, while nutritional status and the number of blood transfusions did not significantly correlate with HCV infection. We conclude that during the past decade, the prevalence of HCV infection in HD patients living in Senegal has declined considerably, mainly because of improved transfusion measures and better clinical practice in the HD centers. Such efforts should be maintained and reinforced to reduce the seroprevalence of HCV infection."
16264,0.005,3.0000,"An epidemiologic study was conducted to determine the prevalence of retroviral infections among people of Qucchua origin in Cuzco and Quillabamba, Peru. The study volunteers included individuals at low and at high risk for retroviral infections. Each volunteer was interviewed to obtain clinical and epidemiologic data, and to identify risk behaviors for infection. The serum was tested for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T cell lymphotropic virus types 1/2 (HTLV-1/2) by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent and Western blot assays. Among a total of 370 volunteers enrolled in the study, 276 were women and 94 were men whose ages ranged between 15 and 49 years. Infection with HTLV-1 was demonstrated in 5.1% (19 of 370), and one of these, a homosexual, was also positive for HIV-1; none had HTLV-2. Overall, the rate of HTLV-1 infection was 5.3% (5 of 94) for males and 5% (14 of 276) for females. Among the low risk group of 211 healthy pregnant women, five (2.3%) were positive for HTLV-1. The rate of HTLV-1 infection in this group was significantly correlated with a history of dental surgery, as well as other surgical procedures, and a history of jaundice. Among the volunteers who practiced risk behavior(s) for retroviral infections, the positive rates for HTLV-1 were 13.7% (7 of 51) for female sex workers, 6.2% (3 of 48) for homosexuals and/or bisexuals, 8.5% (4 of 47) for patients with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and 0.0% (0 of 13) for promiscuous heterosexual males. In female sex workers. HTLV-1 infection was found to be significantly associated with age, a history of STDs or genital ulcers, sexual intercourse during menses, and vaginal douching (P < 0.05). A low prevalence of HIV-1 infection indicates that the virus has not yet spread significantly in these areas."
19715,0.005,3.0000,"Older HIV-positive patients may experience reduced benefit and increased toxicities from combination antiretroviral therapies (cART) due to late diagnosis, weakened immune systems, and other age-related physiological changes. This study investigates the effect of age on time to virologic suppression and CD4 cell count response to cART. Data were collected from a tertiary care immunodeficiency clinic in Toronto. HIV-positive patients with cART initiation after 1/1/1998 were included. Log logistic accelerated failure time models were used to estimate the effect of age on time to virologic suppression. Mixed linear models were used to evaluate CD4 cell response to treatment. A total of 502 patients were studied; 445 were less than 50 years old and 57 were age 50 or over. Of these 73% were male. Thirty-one percent started treatment with boosted protease inhibitors and 43% with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. In a log logistic model adjusting for gender, immigration status, AIDS-defining illness, years since HIV diagnosis, baseline CD4 count and viral load, cART type, calendar year of cART initiation, and hepatitis C diagnosis, older age was not associated with time to virologic suppression (n=418, time ratio=0.94, p=0.20). In a multivariable mixed linear regression model adjusting for the same covariates, age was not associated with CD4 cell count response (n=418, β=0.34, p=0.96). Time to virologic suppression and immunologic response were not significantly different among older and younger patients. Further studies should investigate adherence, comorbidities, and regimen changes in addition to the current covariates."
11056,0.005,3.0000,"(1) BACKGROUND: There are limited data regarding human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence among hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected individuals. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to determine the prevalence of HBV and HCV infection among HIV individuals; (2) METHODS: A total of 409 patients (126 HBV+ and 283 HCV+) referred to the Brazilian Reference Laboratory for Viral Hepatitis from 2010 to 2013 donated serum samples. Anti-HIV, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs, anti-HBcIgM, anti-HBe, HBeAg, and anti-HCV antibodies were measured, and anti-HCV positive samples were tested for viral RNA and genotype; (3) RESULTS: The anti-HIV antibody prevalence was 10.31% and 4.59% among HBV+ and HCV+ patients, respectively. The HCV mean (SD) viral load was log 5.14 ± 1.64 IU/mL, and genotype I was most prevalent (163/283). Anti-HBs and anti-HBc were detected in 40% and 26% of HCV+ individuals, respectively. Among the HBV+ population, the presence of anti-HIV antibodies was associated with male gender, marital status (married), tattoo, sexual orientation, sexual practices (oral sex and anal sex), history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), history of viral hepatitis treatment, and a sexual partner with hepatitis or HIV. For the HCV+ group, the presence of anti-HIV antibodies was associated with female gender, marital status (married), anal intercourse, previous history of STDs, and number of sexual partners; (4) CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of anti-HIV antibodies was found among individuals with HBV and HCV, showing the importance of education programmes towards HIV infection among HBV- and HCV-infected individuals.

18727,0.005,3.0000,"Among women with HIV infection, pregnancy is a time when maintenance of maternal health and reduction of vertical HIV transmission are primary concerns. Few studies have examined adherence to Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) during pregnancy and in the postpartum period when the demands of childcare may significantly interfere with women's self-care behaviors. This study examined ART use and adherence in HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women participating in the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS-IV) in the US. Adherence was assessed through a self-report interview during the third trimester of pregnancy and six-month postpartum. Data were also collected on demographics, biomedical markers and health related symptoms. During the third trimester visit, 77% (309/399) of women completed the self-report adherence measure; 61% (188/309) reported complete adherence. Factors associated with non-adherence included advanced HIV disease status, higher HIV-RNA viral load, more health-related symptoms and alcohol and tobacco use. At six-month postpartum, 55% (220/399) completed the measure; 44% (97/220) of these women reported complete adherence. Factors associated with non-adherence during the postpartum period were ethnicity, more health-related symptoms and WITS clinical site. Results of multivariate analyses using Generalized Estimated Equation analyses across the two visits revealed that more health-related symptoms, higher HIV-RNA viral load, increased alcohol use and clinical site were independently associated with ART non-adherence. These analyses indicate that medication adherence is more likely during pregnancy than postpartum in HIV-infected women, perhaps provoked by motivation to reduce vertical transmission and/or intensive antepartum surveillance. Further investigation is warranted to clarify factors implicated in women's decision-making process regarding ART medication adherence."
7094,0.005,3.0000,"The goal of this study was to determine the period prevalence of mother-child separation (i. e., living apart from mother) and factors associated with separation between women infected with HIV type 1 and their children (17 years old or younger). A retrospective cohort study was conducted, based on routinely collected data by the Family Advocacy, Care and Education Services (FACES) of Children's Hospital (New Orleans, Louisiana) on children (n 586) of 231 HIV-infected mothers followed from July 1, 2001 to March 20, 2003. The 3-month period prevalence of separation from mother ranged between 12.7% and 21.2% over the course of follow-up. At baseline, 14% of children were separated from their mothers. Over the course of follow-up, older children (6 to 17 years), those with mothers who used illegal drugs and/or alcohol and who suffered from mental health problem(s), those whose mothers did not live at a permanent residence, and children with mothers who had a CD4 cell count below 200 cells per microliter were more likely to be separated from their mother. No significant differences in substance use, mental health, CD4 count, or other sociodemographics were identified between women lost to follow-up and those who remained in care. Substance use and mental health problems played a role in maternal-child separation among the HIV-positive women in this sample, even after clinical status and socioeconomic factors were taken into account. Providing additional resources for substance use and mental health treatment may help to prevent or reduce maternal-child separation among similar populations."
10135,0.005,3.0000,"Although human retroviruses seem plausible agents of motor neuron diseases, there are only few reports of patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus, with documented motor neuron disorder. That retroviral infections may cause motor neuron pathology by various mechanisms in animals and humans is known. Neurological symptoms potentially attributed to damage of lower motor neurons are often described during the course of HIV-1 infection and AIDS, however, it is often difficult to establish whether the disorder is primarily affecting the perikarya of lower motor neurons, or whether it is due to a focal proximal axonopathy, or to a dying-back process. We report a 30-year-old heroin abuser, HIV-1 positive, who presented a rapidly progressive limb weakness, muscle wasting, and bulbar signs, in absence of sensory loss of cerebellar and pyramidal signs. Imaging studies were negative. CSF showed increased protein content, negative cytology, and no oligoclonal bands. Serum protein electrophoresis, urinary heavy metal, and viral researches were negative. CD4 cells were counted 340 mm3 with a CD4-CD8 ratio equal to 0.4. Electrophysiology showed acute and chronic neurogenic changes, confirmed by muscle biopsy. Conduction studies along motor and sensory nerves fell within normal range. Biopsy of sural nerve revealed mild myelinated and unmyelinated fiber loss, occasional degeneration and regeneration, unremarkable inflammation. Despite treatment with AZT, zalcitabine, and steroids, the patient died after 3-month illness. Neuropathology showed normal cortical cell Betz's, and hemispheric white matter. Brain stem motor nuclei (inferior olival, dorsal motor of the vagus, hypoglossal) showed atrophy and intracytoplasmatic lipofuscin accumulation. Vacuolization, central chromatolysis, and neuronophagia were rarely seen. As associated pathology, in the fourth ventricle there were two small subependymal foci of demyelination, with reactive astrocytes and vascular proliferation. A possible crucial role of the HIV-1 infection in the development and progression of our patient's illness is considered in view of the known altered immunity proved in MND and ALS cases."
10995,0.005,3.0000,"This study aimed to estimate the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) and associated factors in an outpatient cohort of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) followed between October 2009 and July 2011. We evaluated nausea and/or vomiting, dyspepsia, heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, and flatulence. The outcome variable was the presence of three or more GIS. Sociodemographic (sex, skin color, age, income, years of schooling), lifestyle (smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity level), clinical (antiretroviral therapy, time of HIV infection, CD4 lymphocyte count, viral load), and anthropometric (nutritional status and waist circumference) variables were investigated. Data on sociodemographic and lifestyle variables were collected through a pre-tested and standardized questionnaire. CD4 count was determined by flow cytometry and viral load by branched DNA (bDNA) assays for HIV-1. All variables were analyzed at a p<0.05 significance level. Among 290 patients, the incidence of three or more GIS was 28.8% (95% CI 23.17 to 33.84) and 74.48% presented at least one symptom. Female gender (IR 2.29, 95% CI 1.63 to 3.22) and smoking status (IR 1.93, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.88) were risk factors for the presence of three or more GIS after multivariate Poisson regression. A high incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms was found among PLWHA, and it was significantly associated with female sex and tobacco use. Those results reinforce the relevance of investigating the presence of GIS in PLWHA as it may affect treatment adherence."
5226,0.005,3.0000,"The objective of antiretroviral therapy is to obtain an almost complete and durable suppression of viral replication in all compartments to facilitate recovery of the immune system. We assessed the virologic effect in plasma, tonsillar tissue, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 94 HIV-1-infected patients with CD4 counts >500 x 106 cells per liter and viral load >5000 copies/ml randomly assigned to triple antiretroviral therapy (two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus one protease inhibitor) versus double therapy (two NRTIs). We also analyzed the immunologic recovery in this cohort of patients. Lymphoid tissue and cerebrospinal fluid viral load, development of genotypic resistance, proliferative responses to HIV-1 specific antigens, and other immunophenotypic markers were analyzed. The proportion of patients who achieved a decrease in HIV RNA levels to <200 copies/ml was significantly greater in the triple therapy group than in the two drug groups (p =.0002 for each pair-wise difference). At week 52, tonsillar tissue HIV RNA from 5 patients treated with triple therapy was lower than the limit of detection, whereas the mean +/- standard error in patients with double therapy (n = 5) was 5.03 +/- 0.34 copies/mg/tissue. In all 10 patients, CSF viral load (VL) was <20 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml at week 52. CSF cell counts and protein levels tended to decrease after 52 weeks of antiretroviral therapy. After 1 year of therapy, 13 of 21 patients (62%) in the double-therapy groups (zidovudine plus lamivudine [n = 9] and stavudine plus lamivudine [n = 12]) had evidence of M184V mutation. None of the 10 samples of patients receiving triple therapy could be amplified because of low HIV RNA levels. The mean increase in CD4 cells at week 52 was greater in the stavudine and lamivudine and indinavir group than in the double-treatment arms (186 versus 67 and 102, respectively; p =.03). In patients treated with triple therapy, the increase in naive T cells (CD4 and CD8) was greater than in patients treated with double therapy. Markers of activation decreased further in patients treated with the regimen that included protease inhibitors. Proliferative responses to HIV-1 p24 antigen were never recovered after double or triple therapy. Our study suggests that even in very early stages of HIV-1 disease only therapy with two NRTIs and one protease inhibitor reduces plasma, lymphoid tissue, and CSF VL to undetectable levels. HIV-1-related immune system abnormalities improved but were still defective after 1 year of antiretroviral therapy."
13762,0.005,3.0000,"We examined the association between certain clinical factors and aflatoxin B(1)-albumin adduct (AF-ALB) levels in HIV-positive people. Plasma samples collected from 314 (155 HIV-positive and 159 HIV-negative) people were tested for AF-ALB levels, viral load, CD4+ T-cell count, liver function profile, malaria parasitaemia, and hepatitis B and C virus infections. HIV-positive participants were divided into high and low groups based on their median AF-ALB of 0.93 pmol mg(-1) albumin and multivariable logistic and linear regression methods used to assess relationships between clinical conditions and AF-ALB levels. Multivariable logistic regression showed statistically significant increased odds of having higher HIV viral loads (OR=2.84; 95% CI=1.17-7.78) and higher direct bilirubin levels (OR=5.47; 95% CI=1.03-22.85) among HIV-positive participants in the high AF-ALB group. There were also higher levels of total bilirubin and lower levels of albumin in association with high AF-ALB. Thus, aflatoxin exposure may contribute to high viral loads and abnormal liver function in HIV-positive people and so promote disease progression."
16863,0.005,3.0000,"A randomized, open-label comparative study of entecavir versus adefovir therapy was performed in subjects with chronic hepatitis B who had hepatic decompensation (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score ≥7). Adult subjects were randomized and treated (n = 191) with entecavir 1.0 mg or adefovir 10 mg daily for up to 96 weeks from the date of last subject randomization. Subjects were positive or negative for hepatitis B e antigen and experienced or naive for treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean reduction in serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, as determined by polymerase chain reaction, at week 24, adjusted for baseline HBV DNA and lamivudine resistance status by linear regression analysis. Entecavir demonstrated superiority to adefovir for this endpoint (treatment difference 1.74 log(10) copies/mL [95% confidence interval -2.30, -1.18]; P < 0.0001). The entecavir group showed a greater change from baseline in HBV DNA at all time points through week 48 and a higher proportion of subjects who achieved HBV DNA < 300 copies/mL at weeks 24 (entecavir 49%; adefovir 16%; P < 0.0001) and 48 (entecavir 57%; adefovir 20%; P < 0.0001). Approximately two-thirds of subjects in both groups showed improvement/stabilization in Child-Turcotte-Pugh status. Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score change at week 48 was -2.6 for entecavir and -1.7 for adefovir. Adverse event rates were comparable between groups. Cumulative hepatocellular carcinoma rates were 12% for entecavir and 20% for adefovir. Cumulative death rates were 23% for entecavir and 33% for adefovir. Week 24 mortality rates were 12% for both groups. conclusion: Entecavir demonstrated superior virologic efficacy to adefovir in a population of patients with chronic hepatitis B who had hepatic decompensation. Biochemical and clinical benefits were also demonstrated. Entecavir was well tolerated, and early mortality rates were consistent with rates observed in similar populations treated with lamivudine."
1866,0.005,3.0000,"Noncirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH) represents a relatively infrequent group of conditions that causes portal hypertension in the absence of cirrhosis. An association between NCPH and patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been reported. Six consecutive patients with HIV infection and NCPH were the subject of this series. Case histories, including medication lists, liver biopsy and laboratory data were reviewed. Age at diagnosis was 43 +/- 3 years (range, 37-47). Liver disease was diagnosed 12 +/- 4 years (range, 8-18) after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). All patients developed esophageal varices, 5 patients presented at least one bleeding episode and 2 required TIPS. Serum liver tests showed a mean total bilirubin of 1.4 +/- .7 mg/dL (range, .5-2.5) and INR was 1.2 +/- .14 (range, 1.0-1.4). CD4 count was 326 +/- 124 cells/mL (range, 198-467) and all patients presented HIV viral load < 75 copes/mL. Didanosine (ddl) was the most common ART drug being used by 4 patients. Portal vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 2 patients. Hepatic portal sclerosis (HPS) alone was observed in 1 patient, nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) alone in 2 patients and combined HPS/NRH in 3 patients. In conclusion, NCPH should be included in the differential diagnosis of HIV-individuals presenting with clinical manifestations of portal hypertension and well preserved liver synthetic function. Prolonged exposure to ART, specially ddl, can play a pathogenic role. Rarely, liver synthetic function is sufficiently severe to warrant liver transplantation."
2266,0.005,3.0000,"Experimental evidence from animal models has provided a framework for our current understanding of autoimmune disease pathogenesis and supports the importance of genetic predisposition, molecular mimicry, and immune dysregulation. However, only recently has evidence emerged to support the role of immune dysregulation in human organ-specific autoimmune disease. In the current study of the ""late"" manifestation of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) in a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients following highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we discuss how immune dysregulation and factors associated with the immunopathology of HIV infection fit the current understanding of autoimmunity and provide a plausible basis for our clinical observations. De novo diagnoses of thyroid disease were identified between 1996 and 2002 in 7 HIV treatment centers (5/7 centers completed the study). Patients were diagnosed as clinical case entities and not discovered through thyroid function test screening. Paired plasma specimens were used to demonstrate sequential rise in thyroid antibodies. Seventeen patients were diagnosed with AITD (median age, 38 yr; 65% were of black African or black Caribbean ethnicity; and 82% were female). The median duration of immune reconstitution was 17 months. Graves disease (GD) was diagnosed in 15 of 17 patients. One patient developed hashithyrotoxicosis with atypically raised C-reactive protein, and another developed hypothyroidism. One GD patient had associated secondary hypoadrenalism. The estimated combined prevalence of GD for 4 treatment centers for female patients was 7/234 and for males was 2/1289. The denominator numbers were matched controls, from 4 centers able to provide data, who commenced HAART during the same time (January 1996 to July 2002) and who did not develop clinical AITD. The mean baseline pre-HAART CD4 count was 67 cells/mL, and the mean increase from nadir to AITD presentation was 355 cells/mL. AITD patients were more likely than controls (95% confidence interval, chi-square test) to be severely compromised at baseline (as defined by a CD4 count < 200 cells/mL or the presence of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]-defining diagnosis), and to experience greater CD4 increments following HAART. AITD may be a late manifestation of immune reconstitution in HIV-positive patients taking HAART, and immune dysregulation may be an important factor."
11422,0.005,3.0000,"Oropharyngeal candidiasis, typically caused by Candida albicans, is the most common oral disease associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), a 12-kDa antiprotease, suppresses the growth of C. albicans in vitro. To determine whether the mucosal protein plays a role in protecting oral tissues against fungal infection, we conducted a cross-sectional study investigating the oral and systemic health and salivary SLPI levels in 91 dentate HIV-1-infected adults receiving medical care in the southeastern United States. Participants with a self-reported history of clinical oropharyngeal candidiasis during the previous 2 years constituted the test group (n = 52), while the comparison group (n = 39) had no oropharyngeal candidiasis during that period. Data collected from medical records, oral examination, and SLPI enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantitation of whole saliva were analyzed by t test, analysis of variance, linear regression, and unconditional logistic regression. The test group had a significantly higher mean salivary SLPI level than the comparison group (1.9 microg/ml versus 1.1 microg/ml, P < 0.05). Linear regression modeling identified CD4 cell count and history of oropharyngeal candidiasis as key predictors of salivary SLPI and revealed a significant interaction (P < 0.05) between immunosuppression (CD4 cell count below 200 cells/ microl) and positive history of oropharyngeal candidiasis in predicting salivary SLPI level. By logistic regression modeling, a salivary SLPI level exceeding 2.1 microg/ml, low CD4 count, antiretroviral monotherapy, and smoking were key predictors of oropharyngeal candidiasis. These data support a key role for SLPI in the oral mucosal defense against C. albicans. The antimicrobial mucosal protein may serve as an indicator of previous oropharyngeal candidiasis infection among immunosuppressed persons."
1792,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Retention in HIV medical care has been recognized as critical for long-term favorable clinical outcomes among HIV-positive patients. However, relatively little is known about specific factors related to HIV medical care adherence among HIV-positive women in rural areas in the United States, where the epidemic is rapidly growing among minorities and women. The objective of the current study was to assess barriers and facilitators to HIV clinic visit adherence among HIV-positive women in the rural southeastern region of the United States. Forty HIV-positive women were recruited from four outpatient clinics providing services to HIV-positive patients residing in 23 predominately rural counties in Alabama. Four focus groups were conducted ranging from 5 to 16 participants each. Content analysis was used to analyze and interpret the data. Data coding and sorting was conducted using QRS NVivo 8 software. Participants were predominately African American (92.3%) ranging in age from 29 to 69 years (mean = 46.1 years). On average, participants reported living with HIV for 8.8 years. Factors that impacted participants' ability to maintain clinic visit appointments included personal, contextual, and community/environmental factors that included: patient/provider relationships, family support, access to transportation, organizational infrastructure of the health care facility visited and perceived HIV stigma within their communities. The current study highlights the myriad of retention-in-care barriers faced by HIV-positive women living in rural areas in the southeastern United States. Innovative multilevel interventions that address these factors are sorely needed to increase long-term retention-in-care among HIV-positive women residing in rural areas."
9053,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV coinfection is common and liver disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among coinfected patients. Despite advances in HCV treatment, few HIV coinfected patients actually initiate treatment. We examined patient and provider characteristics associated with a patient's decision to accept or refuse HCV treatment once offered. We conducted patient chart abstraction and surveys with 127 HIV coinfected patients who were offered HCV treatment by their provider and surveys of their HCV care providers at three HIV clinics. Participants were mostly male (87%), minority (66%), and had a history of injection drug use (60%). Most had been diagnosed with HIV for several years (X=13.7 years) and reported HIV transmission through unprotected sex (47%). Of the 127 patients, 79 accepted treatment. In multivariate analysis, patients who had a CD4 greater than 200 cells/mm(3) and a provider with more confidence about HCV treatment were more likely to accept the recommendation to start treatment; younger age was marginally associated with treatment acceptance. In bivariate analysis, added correlates of treatment acceptance included male gender, no recent drug use, and several provider attitudes regarding treatment and philosophy about determination of patient treatment readiness. Patient and provider characteristics are important when understanding a patient's decision to start or defer HCV treatment. Further research is needed to better understand barriers to treatment uptake as new and more effective HCV treatments will soon be available."

Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and its related immunosuppression are associated with an increased risk of prevalent, incident, and persistent squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) of the cervix. The objective of the study was to describe the prevalence and predictors of high-risk HPV and cervical cancer to support the need for strengthening cervical cancer screening programs for HIV infected women in Kenya. A cross sectional study was conducted in a hospital in Central Kenya, Kiambu district. The study population constituted of HIV positive women attending the ART treatment clinic. A total of 715 HIV positive women initiated on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) were enrolled in this study. About 359 (52.1%) were less than 40 years of age and 644 (90.3%) of the patients were widowed. About 642 (92.6%) of the HIV infected women were in follow-up period of ≥ 1 year. The outcome/prognosis of the patients undergoing ICC was 3 cured, 5 good and 4 poor respectively. In a multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis showed that for a one-unit decrease of CD4, we expect 1.23 log odds of increasing the severity of cervical cancer (B = 1.23, P < 0.0 15), given that all of the other variables in the model are held constant. In conclusion screening of all HIV infected women, who are under HIV care and treatment, enrolling patients on HAART with higher CD4 counts is recommended to see the net effect of HAART response."
19882,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exhibiting remarkable genetic variability, includes two genotypes namely HIV-1 (group M, N, O and P) and HIV-2 (group A-H). HIV-1 group M, which is mainly the cause of the AIDS pandemic, is divided into nine pure subtypes, more than 45 circulating recombinant forms (CRF) and numerous unique recombinant forms (URF). According to the documents of Turkish Government of Health, among a total of 6802 HIV-positive cases, 1096 of them were defined as AIDS as of June 2013 in Turkey. Although subtype B is the predominant subtype, recent studies indicate higher proportion of CRFs similar to their increasing role in the HIV pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine the subtype distribution of HIV-1 strains isolated from 70 patients (61 male, 9 female; age range: 16-73 yrs, mean age: 39.6 yrs) who presented to our institution between April 2008-June 2013. HIV-1 strains were subtyped by phylogenetic analysis of the pol gene region and commonly used automated subtyping tools namely, Stanford HIV db v6.2.0 and Rega v3.0. Pol sequences retrieved from the Los Alamos database and from GeneBank, were trimmed from full-length genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of the 1302 base pair of the pol gene region was performed using Mega v5.2 software. The sequences were aligned using Muscle and phylogenetic distances between sequences were estimated by using Kimura two-parameter model (transition/transversion ratio: 2.0). Tree topology was obtained using neighbour-joining method and bootstrap value was set at 1000. Sixty-one (87.1%) patients were antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive and nine were on different ART regimens. The subtypes of the isolates according to phylogenetic analysis were found as follows; 31 (44.2%) subtype B, 24 (34.2%) CRF42_BF, 6 (8.5%) B/CRF02_AG recombinants, 5 (7.1%) sub-subtype A1, 1 (1.4%) sub-subtype F1, 1 (%1.4) CRF 25_cpx, 1 (1.4%) CRF02_AG and 1 (1.4%) CRF01_AE. Rega v3.0 subtyping tool produced five discrepant results (4 B/CRF02-AG and 1 CRF42_BF) compared to phylogenetic analysis. Stanford HIVdb v6.2.0 had eight results (3 CRF42_BF, 2 subtype B, 2 sub-subtype A1, 1 CRF25_cpx) that were not concordant with phylogenetic analysis. Stanford HIVdb v6.2.0 was able to subtype all B/CRF02_AG recombinant strains. B/CRF02_AG recombinants which were seen among homosexual men in France were for the first time isolated in Turkey from five men (2 homosexual, 2 bisexual, 1 heterosexual) and one heterosexual woman. CRF42_BF had not been found in Turkey previously and it has not been a common type isolated in neighboring countries either. Full genome sequencing could be helpful to further analysis of those isolates. Our results support the latest studies from Turkey reporting increase in the proportion of CRF-related infections. This is not an unusual finding when geographical location of Turkey is considered. Nevertheless, more comprehensive data regarding molecular epidemiology and subtype distribution of HIV-1 isolates in Turkey are needed. "

The man (i.e., the index patient) had no history of antiretroviral treatment and reported having sex with multiple named and anonymous male partners, using crystal methamphetamine, and engaging in unprotected insertive and receptive anal intercourse. He had rapid progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) after experiencing signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection. The case was reported to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOH) in late January 2005 and has been described previously. This report describes the public health investigation of the index patient's reported contacts and a review of viral genetic sequencing (genotype) results from other HIV-infected patients in the NYC region to estimate the prevalence of this strain of HIV. The investigation, conducted by NYCDOH, Connecticut Department of Public Health, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, New York State Department of Health, and CDC, identified three other patients with similar risk factors who engaged in high-risk sexual activity at the same time and in the same venues as the index patient and who were infected with a genotypically homologous strain of HIV. The findings demonstrate the usefulness of population-based reporting of HIV genotyping data to identify exact matches of new HIV mutations associated with drug resistance and to determine their characteristics and public health importance. The findings also demonstrate the continued risk for HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) through high-risk behaviors and the need to find effective methods to prevent HIV transmission in this population."

Pegylated interferon-α (PEG-IFN-α) in combination with ribavirin (RBV), the approved and standard therapy, leads to viral eradication in about 50% of treated patients. In 2009, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified host genetic variation to be critical for predicting treatment response and spontaneous clearance in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). A correlated set of polymorphisms in the region of the interleukin-28B (IL-28B) gene on chromosome 19, coding for interferon (IFN)-λ3 were associated with clearance of genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) in patients treated with PEG-IFN-α and RBV. The same polymorphisms were subsequently associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV in untreated patients. In addition, prediction of viral response to PEG-IFN-α and RBV therapy of patients with recurrent HCV infection after orthotopic liver transplantation depends on the IL-28B genotype of both recipient and donor tissues. Diagnosis of a patient's IL-28B genotype is likely to aid in clinical decision making with standard-of-care regimens. Future studies will investigate the possibility of individualizing treatment duration and novel regimens according to IL-28B genotype. As GWAS yield unexpected data, this approach could lead to the development of novel drug therapy, such as already appears promising with IFN-λ. In this Okuda lecture, I present the current understanding in regard to the relationship between host variations and clinical outcome of hepatitis C."

Hypogonadism is prevalent in advanced HIV disease, however, low testosterone levels have not been customarily implicated in HIV-associated anemia. This study was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between testosterone levels and androgen use with anemia in HIV, and to characterize other clinical correlates of HIV-associated anemia. This was a cross-sectional, observational study of 200 HIV-positive patients at a public hospital HIV clinic from July 2000 to August 2001. A written questionnaire detailed previous and current medication use, opportunistic infections, and malignancies. Hematological and virological parameters, testosterone, and erythropoietin levels were measured; CD4(+) T lymphocyte count and viral load nadir and peak levels were obtained from the computerized medical record. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin <13.5 g/dl in men and <11.6 g/dl in women. Twenty-four percent of women and 28% of men were anemic. Anemia was associated with lymphopenia (adjusted OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.36-11.80), high erythropoietin levels (adjusted OR 7.73, 95% CI 2.92-20.48), and low testosterone levels (adjusted OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.01-10.60). Anemia was negatively associated with female sex (adjusted OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.85), current antiretroviral therapy (adjusted OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20-0.95), current androgen use (adjusted OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.84), and macrocytosis (adjusted OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.61). Low testosterone levels may have a positive association and supplemental androgens a negative association with anemia in HIV disease."
15928,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Studying the molecular and genetic bases of primary immunodeficiency is valuable at several levels. First, such information directly benefits patients in both short- and long-term management. Sophisticated diagnostic tools based on these studies can be used early and lead to appropriate treatment before potentially fatal infections and complications arise. Genotyping is also critical for future development and implementation of gene therapy. Secondly, investigating primary immunodeficiency helps understand the normal immune system in humans. As described in this report, the roles of zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa (Zap-70), CD25, and CD3delta are substantially different in humans when compared with the roles of homologous molecules in other species. Last, information obtained from these studies can be applied to other fields of investigation. Prominent examples for such applications include the intensive effort to design and produce specific inhibitors of Zap-70 and Janus kinase 3 as specific immunosuppressive agents. Most types of primary immunodeficiency in general and severe combined immunodeficiency in particular are rare and therefore cannot be easily studied by using traditional genetic methodology. Instead, biochemical methods were used to explore for candidate genes as was the case in the discovery of Zap-70 deficiency. Critical to the success of these discoveries was the careful analysis of patients' thymus glands. Detection of abnormalities in the thymus in these patients, which preceded identification of the genetic defect, aided in the assessment of the severity and nature of the immune disorder (primary versus secondary). Such assessment is critical before high-risk bone marrow transplantation. Equally important was the contribution of studies of the thymus to the description of novel phenotype of immunodeficiency as clearly demonstrated in defining CD8 lymphocytopenia, Zap-70 deficiency, and CD25 deficiency. Indeed, analysis of the thymus directly pointed to CD25 as candidate gene. Recently, the study of thymocyte-derived transcripts using DNA microarrays was key to discovering CD3delta deficiency. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis of the thymus was critical in pinpointing the roles of Zap-70, CD25, and CD3delta in the development of human T cells."

IPV in the past year was defined as ≥1 act of physical, sexual, or emotional violence by the index partner (i.e. boyfriend/husband). The primary outcome was detectable viral load (≥180 copies/ml). In-depth interviews and focus groups were included to contextualize results. Analyses included 195 women (570 visits). Unexpectedly, IPV was associated with significantly lower risk of detectable viral load (adjusted relative risk 0.21, 95 % CI 0.05-0.84, p-value = 0.02). Qualitative findings revealed that women valued emotional and financial support from index partners, despite IPV. IPV was not a major barrier to ART adherence. The observed association between IPV and lower risk of detectable viral load in FSWs may be due to unmeasured personal and relationship factors, warranting further research."
815,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Treatment-naïve advanced HIV-infected patients have a lower life expectancy than those treated early with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Early treatment allows greater immunological recovery, a reduction of AIDS progression, a reduced risk of related illnesses, and lower mortality compared with HAART initiation in advanced disease. Given the numbers with advanced disease worldwide and the high cost of care, strategies encouraging early detection may be life saving and cost effective. Factors associated with increased clinical progression include higher baseline HIV viral load and older age, emphasizing the need for early viral load suppression. HAART initiation faces many challenges; interactions between antiretroviral agents and drugs used to treat life-threatening opportunistic infections may cause subtherapeutic antiretroviral exposure and the development of resistance or supratherapeutic levels resulting in adverse effects. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome can be another cause of suboptimal outcomes. The management of patients with advanced HIV infection should include rapid short-term immune reconstitution to limit the risk of disease progression plus aggressive antiviral treatment to achieve rapid virological suppression. Clear evidence on the optimal regimen and agents to use to target advanced HIV disease is lacking. Therefore, antiretroviral treatment for these patients has to be carefully tailored to the individual according to many variables."

We examined whether serum chemistries at ART initiation predicted mortality among HIV-infected women. From May 2005 to January 2007, we enrolled women initiating ART in a prospective cohort study in Zambia and Kenya. We used Cox proportional hazards models to identify risk factors associated with mortality. Among 661 HIV-infected women, 53 (8%) died during the first year of ART, and tuberculosis was the most common cause of death (32%). Women were more likely to die if they were both hyponatremic (sodium <135 mmol/liter) and hypochloremic (chloride <95 mmol/liter) (37% vs. 6%) or hypoalbuminemic (albumin <34 g/liter, 13% vs. 4%) when initiating ART. A body mass index <18 kg/m(2) [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 5.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6-10.6] and hyponatremia with hypochloremia (aHR 4.5, 95% CI 2.2-9.4) were associated with 1-year mortality after adjusting for country, CD4 cell count, WHO clinical stage, hemoglobin, and albumin. Among women with a CD4 cell count >50 cells/μl, hypoalbuminemia was also a significant predictor of mortality (aHR=3.7, 95% CI 1.4-9.8). Baseline hyponatremia with hypochloremia and hypoalbuminemia predicted mortality in the first year of initiating ART, and these abnormalities might reflect opportunistic infections (e.g., tuberculosis) or advanced HIV disease. Assessment of serum sodium, chloride, and albumin can identify HIV-infected patients at highest risk for mortality who may benefit from more intensive medical management during the first year of ART."

Family physicians and other primary care clinicians commonly provide long-term comprehensive care for persons with HIV infection. This article describes the scope of initial care, including obtaining a thorough history; physical examination for HIV-associated manifestations; attention to HIV-specific immunization schedules; routine and HIV-specific laboratory evaluation; and ensuring standard health care maintenance to prevent HIV- and non-HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Clinicians should encourage combination ART as early as possible, although careful assessment of patient readiness and ability to sustain lifelong treatment must be weighed. After ART initiation, monitoring viral load and CD4 lymphocyte response is essential to ensure viral suppression and evaluate immune system restoration. Opportunistic infections are now less common than in the past because ART usually prevents or markedly delays progression to advanced HIV disease. The most important reasons for consultation or comanagement with an HIV expert include management of antiretroviral drug resistance or drug toxicities, as well as special circumstances such as viral hepatitis coinfection or pregnancy."

Recently, Uganda has experienced a resurgence in HIV incidence and prevalence, but trends in HIV-related deaths have not been well described. Data were collected through the Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment Outcomes (UARTO) Study, an observational longitudinal cohort of Ugandan adults initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) between 2005 and 2013. We calculated cumulative incidence of death within one year of ART initiation, and fit Poisson models with robust variance estimators to estimate the effect enrollment period on one-year risk of death and loss to follow-up. Of 760 persons in UARTO who started ART, 30 deaths occurred within one year of ART initiation (cumulative incidence 3.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.7-5.6%). Risk of death was highest for those starting ART in 2005 (13.0%, 95% CI 6.0-24.0%), decreased in 2006-2007 to 4% (95% CI 2.0-6.0%), and did not change thereafter ( P = 0.61). These results were robust to adjustment for age, sex, CD4 cell count, viral load, asset wealth, baseline depression, and body mass index. Here, we demonstrate that one-year cumulative incidence of death was high just after free ART rollout, decreased the following year, and remained low thereafter. Once established, ART programs in President's Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief-supported countries can maintain high quality care."

HIV positive individuals that become infected with HCV advance more rapidly to AIDS than those that are infected with HIV-1 alone. In this study, HLA-A2.1 mice were immunized with a combination vaccine including HIV and HCV immunogens (polycistronic DNA + proteins) or vaccine containing either HIV or HCV immunogens. Mice immunized with the combined HIV/HCV regimen had similar antibody titers as the group receiving either the HIV-1 or HCV only regimen. Proliferative immune responses showed that mice receiving the combined HIV/HCV vaccine exhibited a three fold higher stimulation index (SI) to gp120 than mice immunized with the vaccine containing HIV alone. To determine whether our vaccine strategy induced Th1 or Th2 immune responses, IFN-gamma and IL-4/IL-5 were measured. The combined HIV/HCV vaccine induced a higher level of Th1 responses to HIV-1 gag protein compared with the other groups, as measured by IFN-gamma production. Interestingly, detection of IFN-gamma by ELISPOT assay demonstrated that the combined HIV/HCV vaccine group had increased numbers of spot forming cells (SFC) to HIV-gp120 peptides when compared to that of the HIV-1 only vaccine group. The combined HIV/HCV vaccine group also showed an increase in SFC to HCV-core peptides in comparison with the group receiving the HCV only vaccine. Intracellular IFN-gamma staining confirmed the ELISPOT results and demonstrated that the combined HIV/HCV group had significantly higher percentages of HIV and HCV-specific CD8+ T cells in comparison to the groups receiving the HIV or HCV vaccines. These results suggest a new approach to maximize vaccine efficacy against HIV and HCV."

The population pharmacokinetics of EVG in treatment-naive and -experienced HIV patients was determined, and the effects of demographic, biometric, and formulation covariates on EVG pharmacokinetics (PK) were evaluated. Data from 31 clinical studies (25 in healthy subjects, 6 phase 1b to phase 3 in HIV-1-infected patients) with COBI-boosted EVG studies (as EVG/co or EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF single-tablet regimen) or RTV-boosted EVG studies (EVG/r) were analyzed using NONMEM. The effect of the covariates age, sex, race, health status (healthy volunteers vs HIV patients), weight, body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), creatinine clearance (estimated GFR), and formulation were evaluated. EVG PK, with COBI or RTV, was described by a 2-compartment model, with first-order absorption and elimination and an absorption lag time. A statistically significant, but not clinically relevant, effect of BSA on EVG clearance (CL) was observed. Coadministration of atazanavir or lopinavir with EVG/r had an effect on EVG CL consistent with the known interaction with these agents. No other covariate had a meaningful effect on EVG PK. EVG PK was well described in a population PK model with HIV-infected patients, with low PK variability and no relevant effect of demographic or biometric covariates."

This Phase II, controlled, open-label, randomized, multicentre dose-ranging trial explored the safety, antiviral activity and pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide, administered by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection, in 71 HIV-1-infected, protease inhibitor-experienced, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-naive adults for 48 weeks. Study participants were randomized to receive enfuvirtide at a deliverable dose of 45, 67.5 or 90 mg twice daily; the 45 mg twice daily dose required 2 injections/day, while the higher doses required 4 injections/day. A background oral antiretroviral (ARV) regimen of abacavir (300 mg twice daily), amprenavir (1200 mg twice daily), ritonavir (200 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was provided with enfuvirtide. A control group received the background ARV regimen alone. All potential participants underwent an HIV genotype at screen to ensure a homogenous population and to exclude patients with evidence of genotypic resistance to NNRTIs. Overall, the tolerability of the combination of abacavir, amprenavir, ritonavir, efavirenz and enfuvirtide was generally comparable to control through 48 weeks. No enfuvirtide dose-dependent adverse events (AEs) were observed across treatment groups. Injection site reactions (ISRs) occurred at least once in 68.5% of the enfuvirtide-treated population, and most ISRs were mild to moderate in severity, with no apparent dose relationship. Excluding ISRs, the most common treatment-emergent AEs were nausea, diarrhoea, dizziness and fatigue; with no clinically significant differences in the incidence of AEs observed between the control and enfuvirtide groups. Each treatment group benefited from ARV therapy, with a trend of increasing antiviral and immunological activity associated with increasing enfuvirtide dose. At 48 weeks, the median HIV-1 RNA change from baseline for the ITT population was -2.24 log10 copies/ml for the combined enfuvirtide groups compared with -1.87 log10 copies/ml for the control group. In addition, 54.9% of patients in the enfuvirtide group achieved HIV-1 RNA < or = 400 copies/ml versus 36.8% of patients in the control group. These results indicate that enfuvirtide has a favourable safety profile and is a promising new antiviral agent for HIV-infected patients who have been on previously failing ARV regimens."

The prevalence rate of HIV-HCV coinfection was 6.9% (95% CI: 5.2 to 8.6). In multivariable analysis, increasing age, use of illicit drugs (injection and non-injection), a history of blood transfusion before 1994, and the absence of a steady partnership were significant independent associated factors for HIV-HCV coinfection. The phylogenetic analysis based on the NS5B region revealed the presence of two major circulating genotypes of HCV: genotypes 1 (58.3%) and 3 (41.7%). The prevalence of HIV-HCV coinfection was lower than those reported in studies conducted with HIV-infected patients in different regions of Brazil, due to the fact that illicit drug use is not a frequent mode of HIV transmission in this region of Brazil. Serologic screening of HIV-patients for HCV before initiating antiretroviral treatment, a comprehensive identification of associated factors, and the implementation of effective harm reduction programs are highly recommended to provide useful information for treatment and to prevent HCV coinfection in these patients.

13347,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"With the advent of potent combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), there has been a reduction in the incidence of wasting. However, few studies have investigated specific body composition changes associated with these treatments. This study aimed to investigate longitudinally the association of increasingly potent ART with changes in body cell mass and wasting utilizing bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA). In this longitudinal cohort study, 159 HIV-positive men were assessed semiannually from 1995 to 1997 for body composition utilizing BIA, CD4 lymphocyte count, HIV viral load, medical and depressive symptoms. Wasting was defined as body cell mass/height below the 90th percentile based on HIV positive norms. ART potency at each visit was scored utilizing published clinical guidelines, ranging from 1 (0-1 antiretrovirals) to 5 (3 or more antiretrovirals including a potent protease inhibitor). Viral resistance testing was not used. The mixed-effects model and the generalized estimating equations approaches were used to determine longitudinal correlates of body cell mass and of wasting, respectively. Over the 2 years of follow-up, potent combination ART use increased from 6% to 79%. Concurrently, a significant increase in mean body cell mass and a reduction in prevalence of wasting were seen, while total body weight, fat mass, and total body water did not change. Increasingly potent ART was associated with significant increases in body cell mass and reduction in wasting. Other significant correlates of increased body cell mass included higher CD4 count and decreased severity of HIV-related symptoms, fatigue and depression. The current study found that higher potency ART taken for relatively short term (2 years) was associated with an increase in body cell mass and a reduction in wasting and that these changes were associated with both medical (CD4, HIV symptoms) and behavioral (fatigue, depression) improvements. One caveat is this study did not distinguish among types of potent ART regimens. Given only some antiretrovirals appear linked to many body composition changes, regardless of their effect on viral load, it may be the type of regimen used that accounted for the relationship seen between viral load and body composition changes."

Patients were included if they were naive to antiretroviral drugs and had no history of AIDS-related opportunistic illness. Risk was assessed as a function of CD4+ lymphocyte count and human immunodeficiency virus load at the time of initiation of HAART in a Cox proportional hazards model. Hazard ratios for AIDS or death were 6.3, 3.5, and 1.7 for persons with baseline CD4+ cell counts of 0-49, 50-199, and 200-349 cells/microL, respectively, compared with the referent (CD4+ cell count > or =500 cells/microL). HAART should not be deferred until the CD4+ cell count reaches <200 cells/microL. The increased hazard associated with CD4+ cell counts of 200-349 cells/microL was modest but supports initiation of HAART at CD4+ cell counts <350 cells/microL, particularly in patients with high virus loads."

However antiviral treatment for chronic HCV infection with Pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and Ribavirin (RBV) is associated with a variety of side effects. In Georgia up to 22% of HIV-infected patients were found to have active Tuberculosis (TB) and 22.4 to 32.6% had latent TB. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics and clinical outcomes of tuberculosis in HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving hepatitis C treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin and calculate incidence rate of TB. A retrospective study was conducted among HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving antiviral treatment for chronic HCV infection at the Infectious Diseases, AIDS and Clinical Immunology Research Center, Tbilisi, Georgia from December 2011 to May, 2015. A total of 420 HIV/HCV co-infected patients received HCV therapy with PEG-IFN and RBV during study period. Six of 420 patients developed TB while receiving PEG IFN + RBV therapy. These patients were on Antiretroviral treatment. Baseline HIV RNA load was <34 copies/ml and CD4+ cell counts >350 cells/mm3. No opportunistic infections were observed in all cases. Three of 6 patients had a previous positive tuberculin skin test (TST) result and had completed isoniazid chemoprophylaxis several years before TB diagnosis. In 2 patients TST was not performed. Only one patient had experienced a previous episode of TB and had completed the anti-TB therapy 1 year before hepatitis C treatment. In all patients TB was diagnosed during the PEG IFN + RBV therapy. Hepatitis C treatment was immediately stopped in all patients. The incidence rate of TB was 1.4 cases per 100 person-years (95% CI=0.58-2.97). Our study emphasizes the necessity of screening for latent TB prior to the initiation of chronic hepatitis C treatment with PEG IFN and RBV. "

One hundred twenty-five HCV+ patients and 1076 HCV- patients were studied; 83% of HCV+ patients were injection drug users. HCV+ subjects experienced no clear benefit from HAART. The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of opportunistic infection, death, and hospitalization were 0.74 (95% CI: 0.31-1.78), 1.78 (95% CI: 0.59-5.37), and 2.1 (95% CI: 0.90-4.90), respectively, comparing the post-HAART era with the pre-HAART era. In contrast, HCV- subjects experienced rate reductions for all outcomes. Comparable HRs for opportunistic infection, death, and hospitalization were 0.49 (95% CI: 0.37-0.64), 0.28 (95% CI: 0.19-0.41), and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.38-0.67), respectively. HCV+ subjects remained at increased risk for death and hospitalization post-HAART even after additional adjustment for antiretroviral use and time-updated CD4 cell and viral load measures. Deaths and hospitalizations in HCV+ patients were primarily for non-AIDS-defining infections and complications of injection drug use. HCV coinfection and comorbidity associated with injection drug use are preventing the realization of substantial health benefits associated with HAART."

Serum HBV DNA and aminotransferase levels, and the degree of necroinflammation and fibrosis determine the therapeutic decisions. All patients with elevated aminotransferase (>twice the upper limit of normal) and serum HBV DNA above 20000 IU/mL should be treated. Liver biopsy is important for therapeutic decisions in cases with mild aminotransferase elevations and serum HBV DNA below 20000 IU/mL. Chronic HBV patients who do not receive treatment should be followed for life. There are seven agents licensed for chronic hepatitis B: standard and pegylated interferon-alpha, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine and tenofovir. One-year courses with pegylated interferon-alpha induce sustained off-therapy remission in 30%-32% of patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B and in a smaller proportion of patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B. Oral antivirals achieve initial on-therapy responses in the majority of patients, but are intended as long-term therapies. Viral suppression has favourable effects on patients' outcome and modifies the natural course of the disease. Viral resistance, however, is the major drawback of long-term oral antiviral therapy. Lamivudine monotherapy is associated with the highest and entecavir monotherapy with the lowest resistance rate so far. There has been no resistance to tenofovir, but after only 18 mo of treatment to date. The optimal first-line anti-HBV therapy with the best long-term cost/benefit ratio remains unclear. If oral antiviral agents are used, compliance should always be ascertained and HBV DNA levels should be regularly tested."

Genotypic resistance testing prior to the initiation of NA therapy may facilitate the selection of optimal drug regime and help to prevent early emergence of clinical resistance. In this study, presence of resistance mutations in treatment-naive individuals with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) was investigated in Hacettepe University Hospital, a referral center in Ankara province, Turkey. A total of 42 patients (17 female, 25 male; age range: 18-62 years) diagnosed as CHB were enrolled in the study with informed consent. All of the patients were negative for hepatitis C and D viruses and human immunodeficiency virus coinfections, and none had a history of interferon or NA treatment. HBV viral load, HBV markers and hepatic enzymes in patients were determined via standardized commercial assays. For the detection of NA resistance mutations, a partial sequence of approximately 250 nucleotides, harboring the frequently-observed sites for NA resistance was amplified via nested PCR and characterized by direct sequencing of the amplicons. The sequences were handled and interpreted for the presence of mutations via various softwares and a web-based virtual phenotyping tool. Well-characterized sequences were obtained in 30 out of 42 samples (71.4%). All circulating HBV strains were observed as genotype D. Nucleotide variations were detected in 19 individuals (63.5%) that comprise silent mutations without amino acid substitution in 8 (26.6%), mutations with undetermined significance in 7 (23.3%) and mutations associated with NA resistance in 3 (10%) patients. Mutations conferring resistance to entecavir + lamivudine (S202G, M204V, L180M, T184N) were identified in one patient whereas L180P, A181Q and A194V substitutions associated with probable lamivudin + adefovir and tenofovir resistance, respectively, were detected in other patients. All patients with resistance mutations were HBsAg and HBeAg positive, anti-HBe negative and had viral loads exceeding 3 x 10(7) IU/ml. In two patients, the route for HBV transmission was vertical. Since no follow-up samples were available from individuals with resistance mutations, alterations in serological markers, viral load and mutation patterns could not be monitored. In conclusion, the presence of NA resistance mutations were revealed in treatment-naive CHB cases in a referral hospital in Turkey. The impact and cost-effectivity of detecting naturally-occurring resistance mutations for clinical follow-up prior to the antiviral therapy need to be elucidated by prospective studies."

The MHC class I-binding NK receptors of these cells have emerged as the most important regulators of the effector activities of cytolytic cells (both NK and CTL). We have studied the modulation of NK activity and the expression of NK receptors in HIV-infected/AIDS patients and report here that the NK activities of the patients with the lowest plasma HIV load were minimal and vice versa, suggesting a decrease in this activity following suppression of HIV replication. Interestingly, the NK activity correlated negatively with the peripheral blood CD4+ T-cell counts of these patients. Furthermore, these patients showed decreased percentages of CD56+ cells expressing NK receptors of the immunoglobulin superfamily, whereas the percentages of CD8+ cells expressing these receptors were increased. Moreover, the expression of C-type lectin-like NK receptor-associated invariant molecule CD94 was increased on CD8+ cells in these patients as compared with HIV-seronegative controls. These changes in the expression of NK receptors were also evident within groups of these patients having different viral loads.

Here, we observed a dramatic increase in monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) level in the peripheral blood of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients compared to that of healthy controls; the level of M-MDSCs proportion in coinfection was not higher than that in HIV or HCV monoinfection. Interestingly, we found the M-MDSCs level in coinfected patients correlated well with CD4(+) T cell loss (r = -0.5680; P = 0.0058), HIV-1 load (r = 0.6011; P = 0.0031), HCV load (r = 0.6288; P = 0.0017) and activated CD38(+) T cells (r = 0.5139; P = 0.0144). Initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy considerably reduced both M-MDSCs and CD8(+) CD38(+) -activated T cell proportion in coinfected patients, and they showed a parallel course of decline. Thus, our results suggest that HIV-1 infection and high chronic immune activation may contribute to the expansion of M-MDSCs and accelerate the disease progression in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. "

Analyses were used to compare patient characteristics, comorbid conditions, and survival durations in HIV-infected and HIV-HCV-coinfected patients. HIV-HCV-coinfected persons did not have a statistically greater rate of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or of renal or cardiovascular disease, but they did have more cases of cirrhosis and transaminase elevations. There were proportionately more deaths in the HIV-HCV-coinfected group. Age, baseline CD4+ cell count, and duration of HAART were significantly associated with survival, but HCV infection was not. HAART use was a strong predictor of increased duration of survival, suggesting that treatment is more important to survival than is HCV coinfection status."

Viral inhibition in ARV-treated individuals was higher than that in ARV treatment-naive individuals. The overall prevalence of drug-resistant mutations was 37.8%. Higher frequencies of mutations in ARV-treated and drug withdrawal groups were found than in the ARV treatment-naive group (P<0.01). Of the four regimens currently used, the D4T/3TC/NVP regimen showed a higher-level viral inhibition. No statistical significance was found among the four regimens in drug-resistant mutations. The rate of resistance-associated mutations to non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was higher than that to nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (P<0.01). The most common mutations conferring resistance to NNRTIs were K103N, Y181C and G190A, representing 56.5, 30.4 and 14.5%, respectively. Furthermore, higher viral inhibition and a lower rate of drug-resistant mutations were achieved in the good compliance group. This study revealed an efficient viral inhibition achieved with the current first-line regimens in China. Most of these regimens could rapidly result in emergence of drug-resistant mutations, suggesting that a second-line ARV therapy is urgently needed and that the compliance with treatment must be emphasized during long-term treatment."

The present prospective study was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy and immunologic responses to the vaccine. From November 1 to December 27, 2002, 262 HIV-1-infected patients received a trivalent influenza subunit vaccine, whereas 66 did not. Influenza illness occurred in 16 vaccinated and 14 nonvaccinated patients (incidence = 6.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 4%-10%] in vaccinated vs. 21.2% [CI: 13%-35%] in nonvaccinated persons, P < 0.001; relative risk = 0.29 [CI: 0.14-0.55]). Influenza vaccine provided clinically effective protection against influenza illness in HIV-1-infected patients. In baseline antibody-negative patients, anti-H1 and anti-H3 antibody responses to the vaccination were significant in those patients with a CD4 count >200 cells/muL compared with those with a CD4 count <200 cells/muL (P < 0.05). In contrast, in baseline antibody-positive patients, good antibody responses were observed irrespective of CD4 counts, like the healthy controls. Based on these results, annual vaccination is recommended. Specific CD4 responses correlated with HIV-1 viral load (VL), especially in patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) compared with those without HAART (P < 0.01), although the clinical efficacy did not correlate with HIV-1 VL. HAART may enhance the immunologic efficacy of influenza vaccine."

Newly emerging antiretroviral medications for HIV have been shown to be effective but require near perfect adherence to offer clinically significant benefits. There is currently great interest in deriving patient factors that may predict optimal medication adherence in HIV-positive persons. In this study, we examined the association of psychosocial and behavioral characteristics using the Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic (MBMD; Millon, Antoni, Millon, Meagher, & Grossman, 2001) and adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among 117 HIV-positive individuals on HAART regimens. Specific indexes of the MBMD were associated with HAART adherence as assessed through patient interview, at baseline assessment, and at 3-month follow-up at a point after which participants had received medication adherence training. As hypothesized, the Medication Abuse scale of the MBMD was uniquely associated with overall adherence at baseline assessment and also predictive of adherence at 3-month follow-up. Additional MBMD scales were also related to overall adherence as well as specific adherence behaviors such as missed doses, following specific instructions, and overmedicating, although the Medication Abuse scale emerged as the most consistent predictor of adherence in the study. These results suggest that the MBMD can be used to predict adherence to HAART medication in a sample of HIV-positive men and women and may subsequently be used to identify those in need of adherence counseling at the point when medications are initiated."

Approximately 60% of these women are African American, and 18% are Latina. A gynecologic infection is the most common symptom that leads to initial medical evaluation. Specific studies at baseline should include CD4 lymphocyte count, HIV-1 RNA level, and gynecologic examination with Papanicolaou smear. Decisions about initiation of antiretroviral therapy depend on the patient's clinical diagnoses, her willingness to adhere to treatment, and CD4 lymphocyte and HIV-1 RNA levels. Levels of HIV-1 RNA may be somewhat lower in women than in men at the same CD4 count, whereas women have higher CD4 lymphocyte counts at the time of AIDS diagnosis. However, prospective trials have not yet indicated the need to change the threshold CD4 lymphocyte counts or HIV-RNA levels for initiation of therapy in women. The efficacy of antiretroviral therapy appears to be similar in men and women, although women are more likely to experience toxicities. Abnormal Papanicolaou smears occur in approximately 40% of women at baseline, and 58% are infected with human papillomavirus. The prevalence of both conditions increases with lower CD4 lymphocyte counts and higher HIV-1 RNA levels. Precursor lesions to cervical cancer may be effectively treated, but almost 50% recur within 1 year, mandating careful follow-up. Referral should be sought for specialized gynecologic care and for issues related to HIV itself, since survival is prolonged in patients treated by physicians who are experienced in treating HIV. When they are provided the same access to care, HIV-infected women have similar prognoses as HIV-infected men."
14779,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Despite the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in improving clinical outcomes, treatment failure remains a significant challenge, particularly for highly treatment-experienced patients. This review evaluates current issues in the management of HIV-infected, treatment-experienced patients. It may provide guidance in selecting active, tolerable drug combinations that promote a reasonable quality of life, full adherence and a durable treatment response. Current treatment guidelines and clinical trial data were reviewed to identify reasons for treatment failure and to summarize therapy options for treatment-experienced and highly treatment-experienced patients. Current treatment options include nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), and inhibitors of viral fusion, entry and integration. The use of NRTIs may be limited by resistance and short- and long-term toxicities. Resistance has restricted the NNRTI class with cross-resistance preventing their sequential use. Etravirine, a next-generation NNRTI, however, demonstrates effective virological suppression in patients with baseline NNRTI resistance. Boosted PIs are key components of ART for treatment-experienced patients. The newer boosted PIs tipranavir and darunavir have demonstrated impressive activity in patients with resistance to NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs, as well as in less treatment-experienced patients for darunavir. The fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide has demonstrated efficacy in heavily treatment-experienced patients, although injection-site reactions can be problematical. The recently approved integrase inhibitor raltegravir has also shown impressive potency and tolerability in highly treatment-experienced patients. Finally, the entry inhibitor maraviroc has also been approved recently, although its use is somewhat limited by the need for HIV tropism testing. The availability of potent next-generation PIs, NNRTIs, integrase and entry-inhibitors may offer improved therapy for treatment-experienced patients, including those with multiresistant virus. These new drugs may reduce HIV immunological and clinical progression and in doing so may also reduce treatment costs."

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline data for hospitalized HIV-infected crack cocaine users recruited for Project HOPE (Hospital Visit Is an Opportunity for Prevention and Engagement with HIV-Positive Crack Users) in Atlanta and Miami who were eligible for ART (reported any lifetime use of ART or CD4 <350 cells/μl). Among 350 eligible participants, whose mean age was 44.9 years (SD 7.0), 49% were male, 90% were black, and 81% were heterosexual. The median CD4 count was 144 cells/μl, and 78 of 350 (22%) were taking ART. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression to examine individual, interpersonal, and structural factors as potential correlates of ART use. Reporting ≥2 visits to outpatient HIV care in the past 6 months (AOR 7.55, 95% CI 3.80-14.99), drug or alcohol treatment in the past 6 months (AOR 2.29, 95% CI 1.06-4.94), and study site being Miami (AOR 2.99, 95% CI 1.56-5.73) were associated with ART use. Current homelessness (AOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20-0.84) and CD4 <200 cells/μl (AOR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15-0.55) were negatively associated with ART use. Among those taking ART, 60% had an HIV-1 viral load <400 copies/ml; this represented 9% of the eligible population. For HIV-infected crack cocaine users, structural factors may be as important as individual and interpersonal factors in facilitating ART utilization. Few HIV(+) crack cocaine users had viral suppression, but among those on ART, viral suppression was achievable."

Newer HAART regimens have less toxicity and better dosing characteristics than first-generation regimens, but it is not known whether they are associated with improved clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of patient factors and initial HAART regimen on survival among HIV-infected patients in routine care. We conducted an observational study of all HAART-naïve patients in the University of Washington HIV cohort who initiated HAART between January 1996 and October 2005. Cox survival analyses were used to examine the association between time to death and treatment with first-generation protease inhibitors (PIs; indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir), newer PIs (amprenavir, atazanavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir), efavirenz, or nevirapine, controlling for baseline characteristics, and calendar period. Of 694 patients, 84 (12%) died. In adjusted analyses, patients treated with a first-generation PI (hazard ratio [HR] 1.9, p = 0.04) or nevirapine (HR 2.0, p = 0.046) had twice the risk of death compared with those receiving a newer PI. Survival for patients treated with efavirenz did not differ from those receiving a newer PI (HR 1.1, p = 0.8). Greater disease severity (HR 1.7, p = 0.03), hepatitis C virus (HCV; HR 1.6, p = 0.05), and depression (HR 2.0, p = 0.007) were independent predictors of increased mortality. This study demonstrates significant improvement in survival among patients initiating HAART with newer PIs compared to first-generation PIs or nevirapine, and highlights the complexity of patient factors affecting the clinical outcomes of treatment."
14846,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the cause of more than three-quarters of liver-related deaths in HIV-seropositive individuals and it is remarkable that today approximately one-quarter of HIV-infected individuals in Europe and the USA have a HCV coinfection. HIV/HCV coinfected patients were more likely to develop cirrhosis, had an increased risk of developing AIDS, of HIV-related disease and of overall mortality.  How HCV may affect the course of HIV infection is not well known even if it was suggested that HCV co-infection is able to increase immune activation and to sensitize CD4+ T-cells towards apoptosis in the absence of HIV therapy. There are many evidences that the simultaneous presence of HIV infection accelerates the liver damage from HCV favouring the evolution to cirrhosis in co-infected patients. HIV increasing of TNF alpha liver production and of HCV replication in peripheral blood lymphomonocytes are the mechanisms at the basis of this phenomenon. HAART had a positive effect on HIV/HCV co-infection, otherwise it does not appear to fully correct the adverse effect of HIV infection on HCV-related outcomes. Traditional treatment with pegilated Interferon plus ribavirin have low rates of sustained virological response in co-infected patients especially if infected with HCV genotype 1, and better results were often obtained in patients in which the use of antiretroviral treatment was avoided to reduce the occurrence of adverse effects.  The recent preliminary results on the use of anti-HCV protease inhibitor drugs, boceprevir and telapravir, in co-infected people seems to demonstrate an enhanced antiviral efficacy in the HIV/HCV co-infected population of triple anti-HCV treatment even is some important limitation as interactions with antiretroviral agents and selection of HCV drug resistance, lead to consider the need for further studies designed to assess the best therapeutic strategies."

Recently published studies show that in CHB patients treated with the currently recommended first-line nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) entecavir or tenofovir, annual HCC incidences range from 0.01% to 1.4% in non-cirrhotic patients, and from 0.9% to 5.4% in those with cirrhosis. In Asian studies including matched untreated controls, current NA therapy consistently resulted in a significantly lower HCC incidence in patients with cirrhosis, amounting to an overall HCC risk reduction of ∼30%; in non-cirrhotic patients, HCC risk reduction was overall ∼80%, but this was only observed in some studies. For patients of Caucasian origin, no appropriate comparative studies are available to date to evaluate the impact of NA treatment on HCC. Achievement of a virologic response under current NA therapy was associated with a lower HCC risk in Asian, but not Caucasian studies. Studies comparing entecavir or tenofovir with older NAs generally found no difference in HCC risk reduction between agents, except for one study which used no rescue therapy in patients developing lamivudine resistance. Overall, these data indicate that with the current, potent NAs, HCC risk can be reduced but not eliminated, probably due to risk factors that are not amenable to change by antiviral therapy, or events that may have taken place before treatment initiation. Validated pre- and on-therapy HCC risk calculators that inform the best practice for HCC surveillance and facilitate patient counseling would be of great practical value. "

From a larger observational epidemiological cohort of 1,024 HIV seroconverters we identified 315 persons on zidovudine monotherapy. In this treated cohort, age, sex, risk group, constitutional symptoms, CD4 cell count, and p24 antigen levels at initiation of treatment and 6 months later were examined separately for two outcomes, AIDS and death, using standard survival methods. The variables measured at the visit at which zidovudine monotherapy was initiated that predicted more rapid progression to AIDS were CD4 cell count (RH = 2.61); constitutional symptoms (RH = 2.56); p24 antigenaemia level (RH = 2. 17); and subsequent change in CD4 cell count (> 30% decline) contributed additional predictive information (RH = 2.70). Results were similar for mortality, and did not vary significantly by risk group. In a tested subset of patients, p24 antigenaemia was associated with high levels of plasma RNA viral load. The median number of HIV RNA copies was about 28,000 copies/ml among p24 antigen-positive individuals and about 7,700 copies/ml among participants who were persistently negative for p24 antigenaemia. CD4 cell count, symptoms and p24 antigenaemia at the start of therapy and CD4 cell decline after initiation of treatment are early indicators of disease progression in zidovudine-treated patients. The combined use of these indicators may help to better predict who will respond to zidovudine or to other antiretroviral therapies."

These ""elite"" controllers are of high interest as they may provide novel insights regarding host mechanisms of virus control. The degree to which these individuals have residual plasma viremia has not been well defined. We performed a longitudinal study of 46 elite controllers, defined as HIV-seropositive, antiretroviral-untreated individuals with plasma HIV RNA levels of <50 to 75 copies/ml. The median duration of HIV diagnosis was 13 years, the median baseline CD4(+) T-cell count was 753 cells/mm(3), and the median duration of follow-up was 16 months. Plasma and cellular HIV RNA levels were measured using the transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay (estimated limit of detection of <3.5 copies RNA/ml). A total of 1,117 TMA assays were performed (median of five time points/subject and four replicates/time point). All but one subject had detectable plasma HIV RNA on at least one time point, and 15 (33%) subjects had detectable RNA at all time points. The majority of controllers also had detectable cell-associated RNA and proviral DNA. A mixed-effect linear model showed no strong evidence of change in plasma RNA levels over time. In conclusion, the vast majority (98%) of elite controllers had measurable plasma HIV RNA, often at levels higher than that observed in antiretroviral-treated patients. This confirms the failure to eradicate the virus, even in these unique individuals who are able to reduce plasma viremia to very low levels without antiretroviral therapy."

In this study, we investigated changes in receptor expression with individual and combinational analysis on NK cell subsets in HIV-infected Chinese. The results showed that natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) expression on total NK cells decreased significantly in HIV infection, while the expressions of natural killer group 2 member A (NKG2A) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor, three domains, long cytoplasmic tail 1 (KIR3DL1) on total NK cells were not significantly different between any of the groups including HIV-positive treatment-naïve group, AIDS treatment-naïve group, HAART-treatment AIDS group and HIV-negative control group. Individual analysis of NKG2A(+) and KIR3DL1(+) cells revealed no significant differences in expression in any NK cell subsets between any of the groups, but the combinational analysis of NKG2D(-)NKG2A(+), and NKG2D(-)KIR3DL1(+) on the NK CD56(dim) cell subset in the AIDS group were increased compared to the HIV-negative control group. On the contrary, NKG2D(-)NKG2A(+) expression on the CD56(bright) subset decreased in the AIDS group compared to the control group. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) treatment almost completely restored the levels of these receptor expressions. The results indicate that the distinct alteration of activating and inhibitory NKR expression on NK cells and its subsets occurred during HIV progression. Moreover, the imbalanced change of activating and inhibitory NKRs on NK cells and its subsets may explain the impaired NK cell immunity in HIV infected individuals."

Identification of mutations associated with drug resistance is critical for both individualized treatment selection and new drug design. We have performed an automated mutation analysis of HIV Type 1 (HIV-1) protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) from approximately 40,000 AIDS patient plasma samples sequenced by Specialty Laboratories Inc. from 1999 to mid-2002. This data set provides a nearly complete mutagenesis of HIV protease and enables the calculation of statistically significant K(a)/K(s) values for each individual amino acid mutation in protease and RT. Positive selection (i.e., a K(a)/K(s) ratio of >1, indicating increased reproductive fitness) detected 19 of 23 known drug-resistant mutation positions in protease and 20 of 34 such positions in RT. We also discovered 163 new amino acid mutations in HIV protease and RT that are strong candidates for drug resistance or fitness. Our results match available independent data on protease mutations associated with specific drug treatments and mutations with positive reproductive fitness, with high statistical significance (the P values for the observed matches to occur by random chance are 10(-5.2) and 10(-16.6), respectively). Our mutation analysis provides a valuable resource for AIDS research and will be available to academic researchers upon publication at http://www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/HIV.

Until recently, combination therapy with peginterferon-α (pegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV) has been the standard of care. However, for many patients, especially those infected with the most common HCV genotype 1 (HCV-1), this treatment has resulted in unsatisfactory treatment response rates. Many clinical factors, including pharmacogenetics, influence the treatment response rate. Genetic variation in the interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene is the major determinant of treatment response, a finding that has been replicated in multiple independent cohorts. This review focuses on the association between pharmacogenetics and conventional pegIFN/RBV therapy in patients infected with HCV non-genotype 1; patients reinfected with HCV after liver transplantation; and patients coinfected with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus. We also review the pharmacogenetic data for boceprevir and telaprevir triple therapy in patients with HCV-1 infection, as well as viral genomic polymorphisms and genetic variants that may protect against anemia. Pharmacogenetic information offers a personalized medicine approach to help clinicians and patients make better informed decisions to maximize response and minimize toxicity for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.

18666,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) allows for substantial control of HIV replication in vivo, and has caused a significant decline in morbidity and mortality rates among patients. However, eradication of the virus from the body is not possible. Therefore, HAART necessarily becomes a life-long treatment and this is associated with several problems: (i) the high cost of therapy; (ii) increased frequency of drug-related side effects; (iii) viral resistance; and (iv) poor patient adherence to the treatment. Based on these considerations, among other alternative strategies, structured treatment interruptions (STI) have been proposed with the potential object-ive of inducing immune-mediated control of HIV replication in HIV-infected patients. The available clinical data indicate that STI might increase HIV-specific, cell-mediated immune responses in patients treated during primary HIV infection; however, it does not seem to have the same effect in patients treated during chronic infection. Nevertheless, in chronically infected patients STI might limit drug-related side effects by decreasing exposure to drugs, without influencing the efficacy of the therapy. In addition, recent data suggest a possible role for immune-modulations such as hydroxyurea and therapeutic vaccines as adjuvant therapies for limiting viral rebound in these patients. Preliminary indications suggest that there is reduced hope for STI as a salvage therapy. Finally, it is important to stress that no controlled, randomized studies of STI have been held in humans, and it is not possible to evaluate fully the clinical impact of such a strategy. Therefore, clinicians and patients should avoid using STI outside the setting of controlled clinical trials."

Induction immunosuppression is standard of care for those at high risk of AR; however, use in HIV+ patients is controversial, given fears of increased infection rates. We sought to compare clinical outcomes between HIV+ KT recipients who were treated with (i) anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), (ii) IL-2 receptor blocker, and (iii) no induction. We studied 830 HIV+ KT recipients between 2000 and 2014, as captured in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, and compared rates of delayed graft function (DGF), AR, graft loss and death. Infections and hospitalizations were ascertained by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes in a subset of 308 patients with Medicare. Compared with no induction, neither induction agent was associated with an increased risk of infection (weighted hazard ratio [wHR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-1.18). HIV+ recipients who received induction spent fewer days in the hospital (weighted relative risk [wRR] 0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.95), had lower rates of DGF (wRR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.84), less graft loss (wHR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24-0.89) and a trend toward lower mortality (wHR 0.60, 95% CI 0.24-1.28). Those who received induction with ATG had lower rates of AR (wRR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-0.99). Induction in HIV+ KT recipients was not associated with increased infections; in fact, those receiving ATG, the most potent agent, had the lowest rates.

The numbers of recipients with HBV and HCV were 160 (4.6%) and 55 (1.6%), respectively. We analyzed the clinical outcomes, including overall mortality and graft failure, among patients who had undergone kidney transplantation.Patients with HBV showed poorer survival (P = 0.019; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.370; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.155-4.865) than KTRs without HBV. However, the graft survival of patients with chronic hepatitis B did not differ from that of patients without HBV. Hepatic complications were the primary causes of mortality of KTRs with HBV. Mortality significantly correlated with a higher grade of inflammation (P = 0.002) and with the use of lamivudine or adefovir antiviral treatment (P = 0.016). HBV-positive KTRs treated with the new-generation antiviral agent entecavir showed improved patient survival compared with KTRs receiving lamivudine (log-rank P = 0.050). HCV did not affect patient survival; however, it increased the incidence of graft failure (P = 0.010; adjusted HR = 2.899; 95% CI: 1.289-6.519). KTRs with HCV had an increased incidence of acute rejection (log-rank P = 0.005, crude HR = 2.144; 95% CI: 1.341-3.426; P = 0.001).KTRs with chronic hepatitis B may exhibit poor survival due to post-transplantation hepatic complications.

The baseline characteristics and outcome of 43 genotype B and 74 genotype C patients were compared. Genotype B patients had significantly more pre-transplant acute flare, worse liver functions and higher model for end-stage liver disease score. Fewer genotype B patients had HBeAg (13% vs. 32%; p=0.017), but HBV DNA seropositivity (by bDNA assay) was comparable (26% vs. 23%; p=0.727). The 3-year graft survival was 83% for genotype B and 89% for genotype C (p=0.2). The rate of HBsAg clearance or seroreversion was the same. The cumulative rate of viral breakthrough due to lamivudine-resistant mutants at 3 years was 4% for genotype B and 21% for genotype C (p=0.017). Liver biopsy after viral breakthrough showed recurrent hepatitis B in 7 of 10 genotype C patients, including 2 with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, and no histologic recurrence in 2 genotype B patients. In conclusion, HBV genotypes B and C are associated with different patterns of end-stage liver diseases that required transplantation, and genotype C may carry a greater risk and severity of recurrence due to lamivudine-resistant mutants."

Between January 1991 and February 1998, a total of 191 OLTs were performed in 178 patients. Among these transplant recipients, 53 patients (29.8%) had positive serological test results for HCV infection by second-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We studied 31 HCV-positive (HCV+) and 21 HCV-negative (HCV-) transplant recipients (control group). Renal and liver function studies were performed, and cryoglobulin, rheumatoid factor, C3, C4, and serum HCV RNA levels and genotype were determined. Results were compared using unpaired Student's t-test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. Six patients in the HCV+ group (19%) had mixed cryoglobulins present at the time of evaluation compared with none in the HCV- group (P =. 036). The only parameter associated with cryoglobulins in the HCV+ group was rheumatoid factor (P <.01). In 3 HCV+ patients with cryoglobulins, extrarenal signs of cryoglobulinemia were present. Glomerulonephritis was found in 4 HCV+ patients. Two patients with purpura and cryoglobulinemia had reduced clinical manifestations after antiviral therapy. In conclusion, mixed cryoglobulinemia was found in approximately 20% of the HCV+ liver transplant recipients. The presence of purpura or glomerulonephritis suggests HCV-associated mixed cryoglobulinemia, a clinical syndrome that may respond favorably to antiviral therapy."

It remains unknown if a change in the value of the scores over time predicts mortality in patients with HIV and viral hepatitis. In this retrospective study, survival in HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV; n = 67), HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV; n = 43), and HIV/HBV/HCV (n = 41) patients was examined using Kaplan-Meier life table analysis. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and FIB-4 scores, two noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis, were calculated at baseline and at last available clinical follow-up to determine the change in fibrosis score. Factors associated with mortality were assessed by Cox proportional hazards, including the change in the noninvasive marker score between the two time points. All-cause mortality was determined by Social Security Death Index and chart review. Sixty-seven were coinfected with HIV/HBV, 43 with HIV/HCV, and 41 were triply infected (HIV/HBV/HCV). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed similar survival for the three groups at 7 years of follow-up (p = 0.10). However, median length of follow-up was lower in HIV/HCV (60.5; range 0-102) compared to HIV/HBV (75.7; 12.3-126.5) and HIV/HBV/HCV (80.0; 2.7-123) months, respectively, p = 0.02. Baseline fibrosis score (p = 0.002), an increase in the value for noninvasive measurements for fibrosis (p < 0.001), and the presence of HIV/HCV coinfection (p = 0.041) were each associated with higher risk for mortality. Baseline fibrosis score (p = 0.03) and an increase in FIB-4 score (p = 0.05) were independent predictors of all-cause mortality, but liver-related mortality was not evaluated. In this study, baseline fibrosis score was predictive of 7-year all-cause mortality. Further studies are needed in a prospective cohort to evaluate the predictive value of monitoring changes in fibrosis scores over time to predict mortality in patients with viral hepatitis."

The prevalence of infection was assessed in Belgian advisers and European expatriates and risk factors for infection defined in a case-control study of expatriate men. Fifteen (1.1%) of 1401 Belgian advisers working in Africa and 41 (0.9%) of 4564 European expatriates living in Africa, were positive for antibody to HIV in a voluntary screening programme in Belgium. Among subjects with antibody to HIV the ratio of men to women was 3:1. These subjects did not have a history of intravenous drug abuse or blood transfusion and only one was homosexual. In a case-control study of 33 expatriate men who had antibody to HIV and 119 controls the men with antibody reported significantly more female sexual partners, who were more commonly local; and significantly more sexual contact with prostitutes in Africa. They had a significantly higher prevalence of history of sexually transmitted disease and had received significantly more injections by unqualified staff in Africa during the previous five years. No specific sexual practices were associated with having antibody to HIV. After multivariate analysis sexual contact with local women (adjusted odds ratio 14.7; 95% confidence interval 2.81 to 76.9), sexual contact with prostitutes (adjusted odds ratio 10.8 (1.6 to 71.9), and injections by unqualified staff (adjusted odds ratio 13.5 (3.7 to 49.8) remained independent risk factors for infection. European expatriates in Africa were at increased risk from infection with HIV and were a means of introducing HIV into the heterosexual population in Europe. Transmission from women to men by vaginal intercourse seemed to be the most probable route of infection."

A retrospective case-control study was conducted by enrolling 664 syphilis inpatients (excluding 11 congenital syphilis patients) and 800 sex- and age-matched controls. Medical histories, clinical data and patient interview data were collected and subjected to logistic regression analyses. The prevalence of syphilis in the study population was 3·9% (675/17,304). By univariate analysis, syphilis infection was associated with migration between cities, marital status, smoking, reproductive history, hypertension, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) (P < 0·05). A high rate of syphilis-HBV co-infection was observed in HIV-negative patients and further research revealed an association between syphilis and specific HBV serological reactivity. Syphilis was also associated with the frequency, duration and status of tobacco use. Multivariate analysis indicated that syphilis infection was independently associated with migration between cities [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1·368, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·048-1·785], current smoking (aOR 1·607, 95% CI 1·177-2·195), elevated BUN (aOR 1·782, 95% CI 1·188-2·673) and some serological patterns of HBV infection. To prevent the spread of infectious diseases, inpatients and blood donors should be tested for HIV, syphilis, HBV and HCV simultaneously."

It usually takes three days and causes chills, high fever, headache, nausea-vomiting and myalgia. The causative agent, namely sandfly fever virus (SFV), is a member of the Bunyaviridae family, Phlebovirus genus. Toscana virus (TOSV) is a serotype of SFV, as so Sicilian and Naples viruses. Seroprevalence studies have demonstrated that SFV infections which have mild symptoms or asymptomatic, can be overcome. Studies concerning TOSV infections in Turkey are limited to a small number of regional seroprevalence surveys, blood-donor screening studies and detection of viral RNA in previously collected cerebrospinal fluid samples of suspected meningoencephalitis patients in whom no causative agents were identified. In this report from Turkey, the first acute case of TOSV infection diagnosed in a patient with HIV seropositivity, was presented. A 42-year-old male patient was admitted to Numune Research and Training Hospital Adana, Turkey with high fever, headache and malaise. The patient who lived in an area near to a forest in Istanbul, had no contact history with ticks, mosquitoes and other animals. He stated that he had had the symptoms before arriving to Adana. The patient was hospitalized due to leucopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia accompanying high fever. Serum samples were sent to National Arbovirus and Viral Zoonotic Diseases Unit of the Turkish Public Health Institute, for the detection of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus and SFV. Western Blot test was run to confirm the presence of anti-HIV antibodies detected twice with ELISA. In the following days, the patient's fever and symptoms decreased, and thrombocyte levels increased. Although CCHF virus PCR and ELISA IgM tests as well as SFV IgM and IgG immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) tests were negative, real time reverse transcriptase PCR test yielded a positive result for TOSV. SFV IgG antibodies against Toscana and Naples viruses were found to be positive in the serum sample collected at the end of a three-week follow-up. Even though TOSV infection is usually known to have an asymptomatic clinical course, it may rarely lead to serious manifestations like meningoencephalitis. In our country where SFV is endemic, TOSV should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with high fever and meningoencephalitis symptoms. "

AIDS-defining conditions (ADC) are suggestive of severe or advanced disease and are a leading cause of HIV-related hospitalizations and death among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in the USA. Optimal adherence to cART can mitigate the impact of ADC and disease severity on the health and survivability of PLWHA. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between ADC at HIV diagnosis and optimal adherence among PLWHA. Using data from the 2008 and 2009 Medicaid data from 29 states, we identified individuals, between 18 and 49 years, recently infected with HIV and with a cART prescription. Frequencies and descriptive statistics were conducted to characterize sample. Univariate and multivariable Poisson regression analyses were employed to evaluate the association optimal cART adherence (defined as ≥ 95% study days covered by cART) and ADC at HIV diagnosis (≥1 ADC) were assessed. Approximately 17% of respondents with ADC at HIV diagnosis reported optimal cART adherence. After adjusting for covariates, respondents with an ADC at HIV diagnosis were less likely to report optimal cART adherence (adjusted prevalence ratio (APR) = 0.64, 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.54-0.75). Among the covariates, males (APR=1.10, 95% CI, 1.02-1.19) compared to females were significantly more likely to report optimal adherence while younger respondents, 18-29 years (APR=0.67, 95% CI, 0.57-0.77), 30-39 years (APR=0.86, 95% CI, 0.79-0.95) compared to older respondents were significantly less likely to report optimal adherence. PLWHA with ADC at HIV diagnosis are at risk of suboptimal cART adherence. Multiple adherence strategies that include healthcare providers, case managers, and peer navigators should be utilized to improve cART adherence and optimize health outcomes among PLWHA with ADC at HIV diagnosis. Targeted adherence programs and services are required to address suboptimal adherence in this population."

Logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations between recent criminal justice involvement (arrest or incarceration in the past 6 months) and recent high-risk partnerships (multiple sex partners, sex trading, or sex with a risky partner in the past 6 months) when adjusting for sociodemographic factors and recent regular drug use. Women with recent criminal justice involvement demonstrated higher odds of engaging in high-risk sex partnerships. Although regular drug use was a significant confounder of several of these relationships, recent arrest or incarceration remained significantly associated with multiple sex partnerships, sex with a risky partner, and engaging in unprotected sex and a high-risk partnership even after controlling for regular drug use and other social stressors. This study highlights the vulnerability of drug-involved women offenders to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk and points to the need for investigation into the role of arrest and incarceration as factors that may contribute to HIV infection."

From March 2006 to November 2009, female sex workers (FSWs) in Yunnan, China were recruited into an open cohort study to determine incidence and risk factors for HSV-2 acquisition. Participants were interviewed and tested for HSV-2 and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) every six months. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-dependent variables was used to measure associations with HSV-2 acquisition. In 3.5 years, 83 incident cases of HSV-2 infection were diagnosed, yielding an overall incidence of 21.9 per 100 person years (PY) (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.8-26.3). Working in higher risk commercial sex venues, current Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, age of sexual debut <18 years and lack of a regular sex partner were independent factors associated with HSV-2 acquisition. The high incidence of HSV-2 suggests that prevention methods for HIV/STI control are urgently needed."

We analyzed both the efficacy of interferon (IFN) alpha therapy in these patients and the predictors of response to this agent. A total of 119 patients with chronic hepatitis C (90 of whom were infected with HIV and 29 of whom were not) were included in a multicenter, prospective, open, nonrandomized observational study. IFN-alpha was given subcutaneously in a dosage of 5 million units three times a week during a 3-month period; those patients who responded received a dose of 3 million units given subcutaneously three times a week for an additional 9 months. One hundred seven patients completed the study; the level of aminotransferases returned to normal and sera became negative (complete response) for HCV RNA in 26 (32.5%) of 80 HIV-infected patients and 10 (37.0%) of 27 non-HIV-infected patients (P = .666) after completion of the treatment. Two variables were independently associated with a response in HIV-infected patients: a CD4+ T lymphocyte count of > 500 x 10(6)/L and a baseline HCV viremia level of < 10(7) copies/mL. In the 12 months following treatment, relapses occurred in 30.8% of the HIV-infected patients and 12.5% of non-HIV-infected patients (P = .403)."
9407,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"We describe a patient with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV) infection and alveolar echinococcosis (AE) with a focus on two messages. Despite being severely immunocompromised over years the patient exhibited a long-term asymptomatic course of AE. This is in clear contrast to reports describing accelerated courses of AE in immunocompromised patients. The patient had therapeutic mebendazole drug levels with only 1/10 of the normal drug dose. He was co-treated with protease inhibitors for his HIV infection. These drugs are known as strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)-dependent metabolism. We speculate that benzimidazoles and protease inhibitors interfere at the CYP3A4-level. The first report of co-infection of HIV and accelerated AE was in a young girl with an extremely low CD4 cell count and an abrogated lymphoproliferative responsiveness to parasite antigen stimulation. Since the CD4 cell count in our patient remained in the range of 27-150 cells/microl, we speculate that there was a critical threshold of immunosupression for constraining AE. Initial treatment with albendazole for AE added to the current highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART), and suppressive toxoplasmosis therapy became complicated by pancytopenia. After full recovery of the bone marrow, mebendazole was introduced with a new HAART and the previously prescribed toxoplasmosis maintenance therapy. Surprisingly, efficient mebendazole levels were achieved with an uncommonly low dose. These observations suggest that the benzimidazoles, albendazole and mebendazole, may interact with protease inhibitors, which are known for their strong inhibition of the CYP3A4."

The neurological manifestations of HIV infection noted in Indian patients is different from those reported in Western countries. Moreover, few studies have investigated the role of virological and immunological parameters with respect to the progression of HIV-1 clade C infection in India. In this study, we measured virological (HIV-1 RNA levels) and immunological parameters (CD4 cell count and inflammatory markers) in the plasma and CSF of HIV-1-infected neurologically asymptomatic and symptomatic (with opportunistic infections and/or dementia) subjects. By using clade-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we ascertained that all samples used for the study were infected with HIV-1 clade C. Among the various laboratory parameters evaluated, high viral loads in the CSF, low CD4 counts, and higher levels of interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), beta(2)-microglobulin, and neopterin were noted in HIV-infected subjects with neurological disease as compared to asymptomatic subjects. These data suggest that the markers evaluated in plasma and CSF samples correlated with occurrence of neurological disease in symptomatic individuals as compared to asymptomatic HIV infected subjects."

Accordingly, a pilot analysis utilizing reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) to detect and sequence HCV in premortem plasma and postmortem brain and liver from 20 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and 10 HIV-naive individuals was undertaken. RNA encoding the first 126 amino acids of the HCV E1 envelope protein and the majority of the E1 signal sequence was analyzed in parallel with an 80-base-long segment of the 5' untranslated region (UTR). Liver HCV was detected only in subjects with premortem HCV viremia (10 HIV-infected and 3 HIV-naive). Brain HCV was detected in 6/10 HCV/HIV-coinfected and 1/3 HCV-monoinfected subjects. In the setting of HIV, the magnitude of plasma HCV load did not correlate with the presence of brain HCV. However, coinfected patients with brain HCV were more often off antiretroviral therapy and tended to have higher plasma HIV loads than those with HCV restricted to liver. Furthermore, premortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed that HCV/HIV-coinfected patients with brain HCV had detectable CSF HIV, whereas those without brain HCV had undetectable CSF HIV loads (P = .0205). Neuropsychologic tests showed a trend for hierarchical impairment of abstraction/executive functioning in HIV/HCV coinfection, with mean T scores for HIV monoinfected patients 43.2 (7.3), for liver-only HCV 39.5 (9.0), and for those with HCV in brain and liver 33.2 (5.1) (P = .0927). Predominant brain HCV sequences did not match those of the plasma or liver in 4 of the 6 coinfected patients analyzed. We conclude that in the setting of HIV/HCV coinfection, brain HCV is a common phenomenon unrelated to the magnitude of HCV viremia, but related to active HIV disease and detectable CSF HIV. Furthermore, there is sequence evidence of brain compartmentalization. Differences in abstraction/executive function of HCV/HIV coinfected patients compared to HIV monoinfected warrant further studies to determine if neuropsychiatric effects are predicated upon brain infection."

The present study sought to estimate the prevalence of HPgV infection and associated risk factors in patients harboring C or non-C HIV-1 subtypes followed-up at HU-FURG, southern Brazil. Samples from 347 HIV-1-infected subjects were subjected to plasma RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, HPgV RNA detection, and HIV-1 genotyping. The overall prevalence of HPgV RNA was 34%. Individuals aged 18-30 years had higher chances of infection compared with those 50 years or older (95%CI 1.18-52.36, P = 0.03). The number of sexual partner between one and three was a risk factor for HPgV infection (95%CI 1.54-10.23; P < 0.01), as well as the time since diagnosis of HIV-1 ≥ 11 years (95%CI 1.01-2.89; P = 0.04). Patients infected with HIV non-C subtypes had six times more chance of being HPgV-infected when compared to subtype C-infected subjects (95%CI 2.28-14.78; P < 0.01).

Overall, 1,287 participants were recruited, 460 males (36%) and 827 females (64%). Health care workers accounted for 253 individuals (20%), 301 were blood donor candidates (23%), 334 were pregnant women (26%), and 399 (31%) were subjects who had been examined in two clinics for routine laboratory testing. The prevalence of total anti-HAV was 88.6% (95% CI: 86.69-90.25). Prevalence of anti-HAV among children up to 10 years was 40.5% (95% CI: 29.6-53.15), reaching 70% (95% CI: 62.25-77.10) in the 11-20 age group. Age, living in rural areas and unemployment were factors associated with higher risk of HAV infection. HBsAg was detected in 2.4% (95% CI: 1.57-3.38%) of the study sample, with a significant age trend (P-value:0.0110). Positivity for total anti-HBc was detected in 18.4% (95% CI = 16.27-20.59) of the subjects. Ninety-three subjects (7.2%) were positive for anti-HBs alone. An association between age, HSV-2 positivity, working nurses and HBV infection has been observed. One patient was HDV positive. The prevalence for HCV was 0.5% (95% CI: 0.22-1.12%). HAV infection seems to be high-intermediate, while HBV shows an intermediate endemicity. It is necessary to highlight the importance of an immunization strategy against HAV and HBV in reducing the incidence of the infection. The prevalence for HCV was very low."

The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection between medical and non medical students, and to explore probable routes of HCV transmission. The project was conducted as a cross-sectional study. The study group included medical students (IV, V and VI year) and non medical students as a control group. The subjects were examined in the period from November 2002 to January 2003, (study group: n = 221; control group: n = 129). Serum samples were tested for antibody to HCV by ELISA method and anti-HCV positive samples were verified using Western Blot Line technique. Probable routes of infection were assessed by questionnaire. Preliminary results obtained in 29% of the target group suggested, that the prevalence of positive anti-HCV among students was 2.6% (95% PU: 1.2%-4.8%). It was higher among non medical than medical students (4.7% vs 1.4%). Anti-hepatitis C virus seropositivity was associated with a history of hepatitis.

A cross-sectional study was performed among adult HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Demographics, comorbidities, and medication lists were collected from medical records. Medication lists were entered into Lexi-Interact drug interaction software and XDDI before/after the addition of SIM- and SOF-containing therapy was documented. Classification and regression tree (CART) analyses identified breakpoints in continuous variables. Before the addition of any HCV therapy, XDDIs were present in 20% of the 335 included patients. After the addition of SIM-containing therapy, the frequency of XDDIs significantly increased to 88.4% (p<0.001). After adding SOF-containing therapy, the prevalence of XDDIs increased to 24.5% (p<0.001). The prevalence of XDDIs was significantly lower for SOF-containing HCV therapy within various types of ART regimens. Use of ≥7 non-HIV medications (CART breakpoint) was the only variable to predict XDDIs before the addition of any HCV therapy. Similarly, this was the only variable to predict XDDIs after the addition of SOF-containing therapy (PR: 4.80; 95% CI: 2.57-8.96, p<0.001).

Serum thyroid hormone concentrations (FT4, FT3, and TSH) and thyroid autoantibodies (TgAb and TPOAb) were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. A total of 200 HIV-infected outpatients were included. Ninety-seven patients (48.5%) were men (mean age of 36.3 +/- 8.3 years). Duration of HIV infection was 49.6 +/- 35.1 months and 53% had previous opportunistic infections (OI). Mean CD4 cell count was 340.6 +/- 173.1 cells/mm(3). Of these, 167 patients (83.5%) received antiretroviral therapy (ARV). Abnormal thyroid function test was detected in 32 patients (16%). Twenty-seven patients (13.5%) had decreased thyroid function (primary hypothyroidism 3, subclinical hypothyroidism 12, and low FT4 with low or normal TSH 12) whereas 5 patients had increased thyroid function (overt hyperthyroidism 1, subclinical hyperthyroidism 1, and isolated high FT3 3). None had clinical features of thyroid hormone dysfunction. Thirteen patients (6.5%) had thyroid antibody positive. Patients who received ARV had higher mean FT3 levels than those who were naïve to ARV (p = 0.017). History of previous OI was found to be an independently significant risk factor for decreased thyroid function with the odds ratio of 3.28 (95% CI =1.183-9.099; p = 0.022). Hypothyroidism was common among Thai HIV-infected patients, especially in those who had history of previous OI.

In conclusion, couples-based interventions and the provision of HAART could substantially decrease behavioural and clinical correlates of HIV transmission among discordant South Indian married couples. The spouses of HIV-infected index patients are at increased risk for HIV infection, and further preventive measures are needed."

However there is evidence that not everyone receives prompt initiation of ART after enrolling into HIV care. The current study investigated factors associated with failure to initiate ART within two years of entering into care among those with a CD4 count at or below 350 cells/mm3. The sample included 4,907 ART-naive patients with a CD4 count at or below 350 cells/mm3 enrolled between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2012 at any of eight clinical sites in the Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). The two-year risk of delayed ART initiation was estimated using a log-binomial regression model with stabilized inverse probability of censoring weights for those lost to follow-up. Adjusting for other factors, an earlier enrollment date was the sole demographic characteristic associated with an increased risk of delayed ART initiation. Higher CD4 count, lower viral load, and a prevalent AIDS diagnosis were clinical characteristics associated with delayed ART initiation. Gender, age, race/ethnicity and HIV risk factors such as reported male-to-male sexual contact and injection drug use were not associated with delayed ART initiation. This study identified characteristics of patients for whom treatment was strongly to moderately recommended but who did not initiate ART within two years of entering care. Despite the known benefits of early antiretroviral therapy initiation, a lower viral load measurement may continue to be an important clinical characteristic in the more recent era with current ART initiation guidelines. These findings provide a target for closer monitoring and intervention to reduce disparities in HIV care."

Two separate criteria for reduced drug susceptibility were evaluated. In multivariate analyses, phenotypic susceptibility was an independent predictor of time to treatment failure (adjusted hazards ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.90; and adjusted HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61-0.95, with reduced drug susceptibility cutoffs defined as 4.0-fold and 2.5-fold higher than reference virus IC(50) values, respectively). Previous protease inhibitor experience was also a significant independent predictor. Notably, drug susceptibility predicted on the basis of treatment history alone was not predictive of time to treatment failure. In this cohort, phenotypic testing results enhanced the ability to predict sustained long-term suppression of virus load."

A multicenter, prospective observational study was conducted in 11 AIDS clinics in Italy to determine the effect of diarrhea on health-related quality of life among patients receiving HAART. The study enrolled 100 consecutive HIV positive patients who had diarrhea while on HAART. For each enrolled patient a control patient with matching disease stage who did not have diarrhea was identified using existing data from another prospective observational study conducted in 34 AIDS clinics (including the 11 in current study). Quality of life was measured by MOS-HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV). Paired t-test and multiple regression analysis were used to compare the quality of life among patients with and without diarrhea. Mean patient age was 40 +/- 7 years; 69% were male. Mean CD4 cell count was 342 +/- 239 cells/mm3; 59% had AIDS. Of the cases, 49 patients had severe diarrhea (> 5 bowel movements or > 3 watery per day) and 46 patients had moderate diarrhea (3-5 bowel movements). Compared to matched control patients, cases experiencing diarrhea while on HAART had significantly lower MOS-HIV scores in all domains. The significant adverse effect of diarrhea on quality of life should be considered when choosing the appropriate antiretroviral drugs regimen."
14809,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the major opportunistic infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons worldwide. Human immunodeficiency virus infection is the most potent known risk factor for reactivation of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and TB disease appears to increase the rate of HIV progression. Pulmonary disease is seen in most patients, including a large proportion of those with extrapulmonary disease. Failure to suspect TB and to order the appropriate diagnostic tests is the most common reason for diagnostic delays. With advancing HIV infection, tuberculin skin test reactivity decreases along with reactivity to nonspecific antigens such as mumps, tetanus toxoid, and Candida; anergy testing need not be a routine component of tuberculosis screening of HIV-infected persons. The diagnosis depends on identifying the organism on smears or cultures; direct amplification tests may facilitate rapid identification of M. tuberculosis, but the relatively low sensitivity in smear-negative specimens limits their use. Also, these tests must be used in conjunction with the clinical assessment, and they must always be performed in conjunction with microscopy and standard culture. Shorter courses of combination preventive therapy of patients with latent tuberculous infection are effective, but the potential advantages of improved adherence and reduced costs of shorter courses should be balanced with an increased risk secondary to ongoing TB exposure in areas with a high TB prevalence. Six months of treatment for active tuberculosis is recommended, unless the response of a particular patient is slow or otherwise suboptimal. The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) made a remarkable impact on the course or HIV disease, but raises several issues with respect to HIV-related TB. Drug interactions necessitate either a non-rifamycin-based regimen or a rifabutin-based regimen in patients on HAART treated for TB."

We assessed New York area care providers for people living with HIV regarding attitudes, knowledge, and practice patterns toward fertility and conception in serodiscordant couples. Data were collected via a survey distributed in October 2013. Seventeen percent of respondents reported prescribing antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for a woman in a serodiscordant couple, and 38% percent of respondents reported having counseled serodiscordant couples on timed, unprotected intercourse without PrEP. Respondents who reported being ""very"" familiar with the data on HIV transmission in serodiscordant couples were more likely to report counseling their patients in timed, unprotected intercourse compared with those who reported less familiarity with the data (41% vs. 8%, p = 0.001). Although only 20% reported being ""very"" or ""somewhat"" familiar with the data on the safety of sperm washing with intrauterine insemination, those who did were more likely to have reported referring a patient for assisted reproductive technology (61% vs. 32%, p = 0.006). Effective patient counseling and referral for appropriate reproductive options were associated with knowledge of the literature pertaining to these options. This emphasizes the need for further provider education on reproductive options and appropriate counseling for serodiscordant couples. "

Little is known concerning whether this also occurs in other Asia-Pacific countries. Between 1994 and 2010, a prospective observational cohort study was performed to assess the incidence of recent HCV seroconversion in 892 HIV-infected patients (731 MSM and 161 heterosexuals) who were not injecting drug users. A nested case-control study was conducted to identify associated factors with recent HCV seroconversion, and phylogenetic analysis was performed using NS5B sequences amplified from seroconverters. During a total followup duration of 4,270 person-years (PY), 30 patients (3.36%) had HCV seroconversion, with an overall incidence rate of 7.03 per 1,000 PY. The rate increased from 0 in 1994 to 2000 and 2.29 in 2001 to 2005 to 10.13 per 1,000 PY in 2006 to 2010 (P < 0.05). After adjustment for age and HIV transmission route, recent syphilis remained an independent factor associated with HCV seroconversion (odds ratio, 7.731; 95% confidence interval, 3.131 to 19.086; P < 0.01). In a nested case-control study, seroconverters had higher aminotranferase levels and were more likely to have CD4 ≥ 200 cells/μl and recent syphilis than nonseroconverters (P < 0.05). Among the 21 patients with HCV viremia, phylogenetic analysis revealed 7 HCV transmission clusters or pairs (4 within genotype 1b, 2 within genotype 2a, and 1 within genotype 3a). The incidence of HCV seroconversion that is associated with recent syphilis is increasing among HIV-infected patients in Taiwan."

This study evaluated whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug penetration and CSF virological suppression influence the extent of neuropsychological (NP) improvement during ART. Overall performance on a battery of NP tests administered at baseline and follow-up (median 15 weeks) was computed by using the global deficit score (GDS) methods in 31 cognitively impaired, HIV-infected individuals who began new ART regimens. Virological suppression (attaining undetectable viral load by RT-PCR at follow-up) was assessed separately for plasma and CSF. Subjects on regimens containing greater numbers of CSF-penetrating drugs showed significantly greater reduction in CSF viral load. Subjects attaining CSF virological suppression demonstrated greater GDS improvement than those who did not (median GDS change, 0.62 vs 0.23; p = 0.01). A similar trend for plasma did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.053). NP improvement was greater in ART-naive versus treatment-experienced subjects. In a multivariate model (overall p = 0.0008), significant, independent predictors of GDS reduction were CSF HIV RNA suppression, baseline antiretroviral history, and their interaction. Including CSF-penetrating drugs in the ART regimen and monitoring CSF viral load may be indicated for individuals with HIV-associated cognitive impairment."

Because PI-based regimens are associated with significant long-term toxicity and adherence difficulty, there is a need for novel regimens that maximize combination treatment options. This 12-month, observational, cohort study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a novel three-drug HAART regimen. Drug treatment consisted of nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), and didanosine (ddl). Twenty-six treatment-naive and -experienced HIV-1+ men and women were included in the study. Assessment consisted of CD4+ cell count, plasma HIV-1 RNA load, and adverse effects of study medications. After one year of therapy, 11/12 treatment-naive subjects (92%) and 8/9 treatment-experienced subjects (89%) had viral loads < 400 copies/mL. Both groups also had an excellent immune response. At one year, there was a mean increase of 438 CD4+ cells/mm3 among treatment-naive subjects and 367 cells/mm3 among treatment-experienced subjects. Treatment-limiting adverse effects occurred in 3/15 treatment-naive (20%) and 2/11 treatment-experienced (18%) subjects. These preliminary data suggest that the combination of NVP, EFV, and ddl is simple, safe, and effective."
2725,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Natural progression of HIV-1 infection depends on genetic variation in the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I locus, and the CD8+ T cell response is thought to be a primary mechanism of this effect. However, polymorphism within the MHC may also alter innate immune activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by changing interactions of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules with leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILR), a group of immunoregulatory receptors mainly expressed on myelomonocytic cells including dendritic cells (DCs). We used previously characterized HLA allotype-specific binding capacities of LILRB1 and LILRB2 as well as data from a large cohort of HIV-1-infected individuals (N = 5126) to test whether LILR-HLA class I interactions influence viral load in HIV-1 infection. Our analyses in persons of European descent, the largest ethnic group examined, show that the effect of HLA-B alleles on HIV-1 control correlates with the binding strength between corresponding HLA-B allotypes and LILRB2 (p = 10(-2)). Moreover, overall binding strength of LILRB2 to classical HLA class I allotypes, defined by the HLA-A/B/C genotypes in each patient, positively associates with viral replication in the absence of therapy in patients of both European (p = 10(-11)-10(-9)) and African (p = 10(-5)-10(-3)) descent. This effect appears to be driven by variations in LILRB2 binding affinities to HLA-B and is independent of individual class I allelic effects that are not related to the LILRB2 function. Correspondingly, in vitro experiments suggest that strong LILRB2-HLA binding negatively affects antigen-presenting properties of DCs. Thus, we propose an impact of LILRB2 on HIV-1 disease outcomes through altered regulation of DCs by LILRB2-HLA engagement."

These renal diseases usually present as a nephrotic syndrome with progressive loss of renal function and an increased risk of mortality. The prevalence and epidemiology of these renal lesions remain largely undefined; however, most studies agree that black race is a major risk factor for HIVAN. Observational studies have suggested that antiretroviral medications and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have beneficial effects on slowing the progression of renal disease among patients with HIVAN; however, little is known about the effect of these therapies on other renal lesions. Future research should focus on gaining a better understanding of the distribution and determinants of renal disease among HIV-infected patients as well as on performing controlled studies to test treatment strategies."

To assess the effectiveness of current first-line regimen we estimated virological suppression on completion of 1 year of ART. The study describes the correlates of virological failure (VF) and multinucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) drug resistance mutations (DRMs).In this cross-sectional study conducted between June and August 2014, consecutive adults from 4 State sponsored ART clinics of western India were recruited for plasma viral load screening at 12 ± 2 months of ART initiation. Individuals with plasma viral load >1000 copies/mL were selected for HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) genotyping. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with VF and multi-NRTI resistance mutations. Criteria adopted for multi-NRTI resistance mutation were either presence of K65R or 3 or more thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) or presence of M184V along with 2 TAMs.Of the 844 study participants, virological suppression at 1 year was achieved in 87.7% of individuals. Factors significantly associated with VF (P < 0.005) were 12 months CD4 count of ≤100 cells/μL (adjusted OR -7.11), low reported adherence (adjusted OR -4.44), and those living without any partner (adjusted OR -1.98). In patients with VF, the prevalence of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) DRM (78.75%) were higher as compared to NRTI (58.75%). Multi-NRTI DRMs were present in 32.5% of sequences and were significantly associated with CD4 count of ≤100 cells/μL at baseline (adjusted OR -13.00) and TDF-based failing regimen (adjusted OR -20.43). Additionally, low reported adherence was negatively associated with multi-NRTI resistance (adjusted OR -0.11, P = 0.015). K65R mutation was significantly associated with tenofovir (TDF)-based failing regimen (P < 0.001).The study supports early linkage of HIV-infected individuals to the program for ART initiation, adherence improvement, and introduction of viral load monitoring. With recent introduction of TDF-based regimen, the emergence of K65R needs to be monitored closely among HIV-1 subtype C-infected Indian population. "

The development of resistance to nucleos(t)ide analogues has been associated with exacerbations in liver disease and increased risk of emergence of multidrug resistance. The selection of a potent nucleos(t)ide analogue with a high barrier to resistance as a first-line therapy, such as entecavir or tenofovir, provides the best chance of achieving long-term treatment goals and should be used wherever possible. The barrier to resistance of a given nucleos(t)ide analogue is influenced by genetic barrier, drug potency, patient adherence, pharmacological barrier, viral fitness, mechanism of action, and cross-resistance. In countries with limited health-care resources, the selection of a therapy with a high barrier to resistance is not always possible and alternative strategies for preventing resistance might be needed, although limited data are available to support these strategies."

Blips might represent low-level ongoing viral replication in the presence of drug or simply release of virions from the latent reservoir. Patients treated early during HIV-1 infection are more likely to have a lower total body viral burden, a homogenous viral population, and preserved HIV-1-specific immune responses. Consequently, viral blips may be less frequent in them than in patients treated during chronic infection. To test this hypothesis, we compared the occurrence of viral blips in 76 acutely infected patients (primary HIV infection [PHI] group) who started therapy within 6 months of the onset of symptoms with that in 47 patients who started HAART therapy during chronic infection (chronic HIV infection [CHI] group). Viral blip frequency was approximately twofold higher in CHI patients (0.122 +/- 0.12/viral load [VL] sample, mean +/- standard deviation) than in PHI patients (0.066 +/- 0.09/VL sample). However, in both groups, viral blip frequency did not increase with longer periods of observation. Also, no difference in viral blip frequency was observed between treatment subgroups, and the occurrence of a blip was not associated with a recent change in CD4(+) T-cell count. Finally, in PHI patients the VL set point was a significant predictor of blip frequency during treatment."

Unlike azidothymidine-a reverse transcriptase inhibitor-cimetidine blocked HIV infection without affecting cell growth, as no cytotoxicity was observed even at the highest 1 mM dose. Ranitidine and famotidine were less potent than cimetidine. H1 antagonists, cyproheptadine and diphenhydramine, had no effect on HIV replication. Although the activity of cimetidine was observed at concentrations attainable by oral administration, the mechanism of anti-HIV action is unknown.

In the past decade, a number of studies reported that the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance among newly diagnosed patients has reached an overall 9% prevalence worldwide. Also, a number of studies using longitudinal HIV-1 patient study cohorts demonstrated that the cellular HIV-1 DNA level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has a prognostic value for the progression of HIV-1 disease independently of plasma HIV-1 RNA load and CD4 count. Using a previously established molecular-beacon-based real-time PCR methodology, cellular HIV-1 DNA levels were quantified in newly diagnosed and antiretroviral-naive patients in Northern Greece recruited between 2009 and 2010 using a predefined enrolling strategy, in an effort to investigate whether there is any relationship between cellular HIV-1 DNA levels and HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance. As part of the same study, DNA sequences encoding the env (C2-C5 region of gp120) were also amplified from PBMC-extracted DNA in order to determine the genotypic coreceptor tropism and genetic subtype. Cellular HIV-1 DNA levels had a median of 3.309 log10 HIV-1 copies per 10(6) PBMCs and demonstrated no correlation between cellular HIV-1 DNA levels and HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance. An absence of association between cellular HIV-1 DNA levels with plasma viral HIV-1 RNA load and CD4 levels was also found reconfirming the previously published study. Genotypic analysis of coreceptor tropism indicated that 96% of samples, independently of the presence or not of genotypic drug resistance, were CCR5-tropic. Overall, the findings reconfirmed the previously proposed proposition that transmitted drug resistance does not have an impact on disease progression in HIV-1-infected individuals. Also, CCR5 coreceptor tropism dominance suggests that both drug-resistant and drug-sensitive strains behave similarly in early infection in newly diagnosed patients."

Combination therapy with daclatasvir and asunaprevir (DCV/ASV) that has proven efficacy for dialysis patients infected with genotype 1b HCV (HCV/1b) has several concerns in Japan. The recently available combination therapy with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir (OBV/PTV/r) is not contraindicated in patients with chronic renal failure and has more safety profile and shorter treatment period than that with DCV/ASV. We evaluated the effects of combination therapy with OBV/PTV/r in four dialysis patients infected with HCV/1b, who were eligible for our study. On-treatment assessments included standard laboratory testing, serum HCV RNA and symptom-directed physical examinations. Three patients had a sustained virological response at 12 weeks after treatment, but one remaining patient had viral breakthrough. Notably, the patient with viral breakthrough had been coinfected with HCV/1b and HCV/2b; namely, HCV/2b with resistance-associated variations was not eradicated by the combination therapy. Among the three patients responsive to the combination therapy, one patient complained of appetite loss and itching, while in another patient the therapy was discontinued due to itching, exacerbation of wamble, and a falling tendency probably due to interaction with valsartan. These AEs were ameliorated or disappeared after the completion of the therapy. The significance of our study is persuasive virological evaluation associated to the combination therapy and reasonable interpretation of AEs. In conclusion, combination therapy with OBV/PTV/r may have promise as an efficacious therapy, but caution regarding AEs should be practiced."

No studies explored the relationship between health status and serum testosterone (T) in HIV-infected men. This study aims to investigate the association between total serum T and HANA, multimorbidity, and frailty in a large cohort of 1359 HIV-infected men and to explore the relationship between patients' overall health status and serum T. Among biochemical and hormonal measurement performed the main are serum total T, free triiodothyronine (fT3), and luteinizing hormone. Other outcome measurements include anthropometry, assessment of comorbidities and disabilities, overall health status defined as the number of HANA and by the 38-item multimorbidity frailty index, anthropometry, and bone mineral density. The cumulative relative risk of comorbidities is increased in HIV-infected men with hypogonadism (p < 0.001) and hypogonadism is associated with several comorbidities. The prevalence of hypogonadism increases progressively with the increase of the number of comorbidities. Frailty index is inversely related to serum total T (age-adjusted r = 0.298, r(2) = 0.089, p < 0.0001). Serum fT3 levels are significantly lower in hypogonadal than eugonadal men (p = 0.022). This suggests that low serum T could be considered a sensitive marker of frailty and poor health status and that the latter might induce hypogonadism. The more HIV-infected men are frail the more they are hypogonadal. This suggests that hypogonadism might be a naturally occurring condition in unhealthy HIV-infected men and raises concern about the safety of T treatment. In conclusion, low serum T is associated with multimorbidity, HANA, and frailty in HIV-infected men and this association seems to be bidirectional. Given the wide attitude to offer T treatment to HIV-infected men, caution is needed when prescribing T to HIV-infected male patients, especially if the patient is unhealthy or frail."

Protein-calorie malnutrition (a common form of malnutrition in the region) hastens HIV disease progression, and food insecurity is a barrier to medication adherence. Analyses of patient outcomes have identified a low body mass index after the start of ART as an independent predictor of early mortality, but the causes of a low body mass index are multifactorial (eg, normal anthropometric variation, chronic inadequate food intake, and/or wasting associated with HIV infection and other infectious diseases). Although there is much information on population-level humanitarian food assistance, few data exist to measure the effectiveness of macronutrient supplementation or to identify individuals most likely to benefit. In this report, we review the current evidence supporting macronutrient supplementation for HIV-infected adults, we report on clinical trials in resource-adequate and resource-constrained settings, and we highlight priority areas for future research."

Participants experienced high levels of substance use. Significant associations were found between substance use and adherence to HIV treatment medications, and between substance use and high-risk sexual practices within the entire group. Group analyses by sexual orientation/gender show that the association between substance use and treatment adherence is found primarily among heterosexual males whereas the relationship between several drugs and high-risk sexual practices is strongest among gay and bisexual men.

Serum levels of sTNFR type I and II were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in sixty five patients with HIV-1 infected hemophiliacs and 10 healthy controls. In a longitudinal study, we assessed whether the decline of CD4+ lymphocyte counts were associated with increased serum concentrations of sTNFRs. Elevated serum concentrations of sTNFRs were found among the HIV-1 infected patients and higher in patients with advanced clinical stage. We noticed there were two distinct patient groups in change of CD4+ lymphocyte count when twenty-eight patients were followed retrospectively for a median period of 65 months. 14 patients represented stable CD4+ lymphocyte counts, but another 14 patients had more than 40% decrease of CD4+ lymphocyte counts over the course of this study. Serum sTNFR type II levels were 3.49 +/- 0.71 to 3.11 +/- 0.31 ng/ml in the former group, and 4.88 +/- 0.91 to 4.26 +/- 0.71 ng/ml in the latter group during the study. Significantly higher levels of sTNFR type II were already revealed at early time in the latter group. There was, however, no significant difference in the level of sTNFR type I between the two. These results suggest that serum levels of sTNFR type II provided useful information as a predictor of disease progression related to the decline of CD4+ lymphocyte counts."

Although a large number of antiretrovirals are used to treat HIVD, zidovudine is the best studied. Zidovudine therapy has been associated with reduced levels of HIV RNA in CSF, fewer HIV-related changes in brain tissue at autopsy, and time-limited improvements in neurological function among AIDS and HIVD patients. More recent studies have investigated the penetration into CSF of other antiretrovirals, including protease inhibitors, and the clinical efficacy of abacavir in the treatment of dementia. HIV encephalopathy may occur in 30%-60% of children with AIDS and causes significant disability. Zidovudine has been associated with improved neuropsychological functioning in children with progressive encephalopathy, but optimum dosing levels, duration of effect, and prophylactic potential remain to be demonstrated."

We investigated HCV-related risk factors in Korea where intravenous drug use (IVDU) is uncommon. The HCV-related risk factors were investigated in a prospective, multicenter chronic HCV cohort (n = 711) using a standardized questionnaire in four university hospitals. The results were compared with those of 206 patients with chronic liver diseases not related to either of HCV or hepatitis B virus infection (comparison group). The IVDU was found in 3.9% and remote blood transfusion (≥ 20 yr ago) in 18.3% in HCV cohort group, while that in comparison group was in none and 5.3%, respectively. In a multivariate logistic analysis, transfusion in the remote past (odds ratio [OR], 2.99), needle stick injury (OR, 4.72), surgery (OR, 1.89), dental procedures (OR, 2.96), tattooing (OR, 2.07), and multiple sexual partners (2-3 persons; OR, 2.14, ≥ 4 persons; OR, 3.19), were independent risk factors for HCV infection. In conclusion, the major risk factors for HCV infection in Korea are mostly related to conventional or alterative healthcare procedures such as blood transfusion in the remote past, needle stick injury, surgery, dental procedure, and tattooing although multiple sex partners or IVDU plays a minor role."

Some severe adverse events have been attributed to mitochondrial dysfunction. Since 1991, cases of severe lactic acidosis have been reported in association with nucleoside therapy. Our objective was to report two cases of metabolic acidosis and hepatic steatosis in patients receiving stavudine (d4T) and to review the literature. A male and a female, 47 and 45 years of age, respectively, presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weakness after 9 and 6 months, respectively, of treatment with stavudine. At presentation, both patients had severe metabolic acidosis and liver failure. Ultrasonography showed hepatic steatosis (confirmed by biopsy in one case). All antiretroviral drugs were withdrawn and patients were treated with bicarbonate. Both patients developed fulminant liver dysfunction and multiple organ failure. We reviewed the literature and found 75 cases of lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis associated with use of NRTI; 57 of these patients received d4T (76%). Of all cases reported in association with nucleoside therapy, 63% were females and mortality was 47%. General weakness, hepatic enzyme elevation, and liver steatosis are data that should alert physicians to this serious adverse event and to respond with prompt interruption of antiretroviral drugs and measurement of lactic acid in plasma. It is important to report serious adverse events in commercially released drugs to know prevalence in an exposed population. Physicians should be aware of risk and early signs of this serious adverse event."

This study examined sudden death victims from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, State of Maryland, for active myocarditis. A group of HIV-negative drug abusers is compared with a group of HIV-negative victims without any known risk factors for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Using modified Dallas criteria combined with an avidin-biotin-labeled immunoperoxidase procedure, the cases were classified as active, borderline, or absent myocarditis. Serologic analysis for circulating antimyocardial antibody was performed along with phenotypic analysis of the infiltrate. Of the 15 IV drug abuse cases examined, none were positive for HIV (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot). With IV drug abuse as the primary risk factor, five cases demonstrated active myocarditis, while five others had borderline myocarditis. Only one of 10 low-risk patients had a lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with borderline myocarditis. Drug abuse-related myocarditis was associated with cardiac pathology resulting in sudden death in only one case. Antimyocardial antibodies were positive in four of the 15 IV drug abuse cases, including patients with active, borderline, and absent myocarditis. The phenotypic expression of the lymphocytic infiltrates was similar to the findings reported for idiopathic and HIV-related myocarditis (Am J Pathol 137:1365-1371, 1990). Toxicology studies did not implicate any particular drug of abuse, but the increased frequency of myocarditis observed may reflect complications of cocaine or the combined effects of opiates and cocaine. Intravenous drug abuse is an independent risk factor for myocarditis and must be taken into consideration in studies of HIV-associated myocarditis."
1833,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Since the introduction of the HIV protease inhibitors in 1995, considerable progress has been made in the treatment of HIV-infected patients. However, treatment has not been without problems. Studies have demonstrated associations between protease inhibitor concentrations and efficacy and in some cases toxicity. As considerable inter-individual and intra-individual variations of protease inhibitor concentrations have been observed, it has been questioned to what extent this has clinical implications with regard to efficacy and toxicity. As a consequence the use of protease inhibitor concentration measurements to optimise HIV antiretroviral therapy (therapeutic drug monitoring--TDM) has been suggested. The objectives of this study, initiated in 2000, were: to establish a method for the simultaneous measurement of the available protease inhibitors; to explore the pharmacokinetics of the protease inhibitors in clinically relevant situations and in this context; to consider the applicability of TDM in protease inhibitor therapy. The presented studies and review demonstrate: 1) that it is feasible to measure protease inhibitor plasma concentrations in a clinical setting with precision and accuracy, and that protease inhibitor concentrations are very stable during different circumstances ex vivo; 2) that protease inhibitor plasma concentrations display limited long-term intra-individual variation but considerable inter-individual variation; 3) that protease inhibitor plasma concentrations display considerable intra-individual variations between morning and evening and in the case of drug-drug interactions; 4) that protease inhibitor drug-drug interactions can be unpredictable and adverse but also that protease inhibitor drug-drug interactions can be exploited to increase protease inhibitor concentrations or decrease protease inhibitor dose; 5) that increases in protease inhibitor plasma concentrations can enhance efficacy but also that decreases can reduce toxicity; 6) that the concentration-efficacy associations which have been established by others can be confirmed in clinical trials but that concentration-toxicity associations are more difficult to establish and confirm. The experiences with protease inhibitor therapy and the understanding of protease inhibitor pharmacokinetics have resulted in new treatment principles and the development of new and better protease inhibitors. Most patients achieve concentrations several folds higher than the minimum effective concentration with the regimens that are used currently (2007). As a result TDM in protease inhibitor therapy has become less relevant in HIV-infected patients receiving their first protease inhibitor. In protease inhibitor experienced patients, harbouring HIV with varying degrees of resistance/reduced susceptibility to protease inhibitors, the combination of TDM and genotypic resistance testing, seems to be a promising tool, but prospective studies are needed. In some patients with certain conditions or in certain circumstances known to be associated with considerable inter-individual or intra-individual variation of protease inhibitor concentrations (drug-drug interactions, gastrointestinal disease, pregnancy or children) TDM might also be of benefit. However, no studies have investigated these patients specifically in randomised TDM trials."

Timely HIV and HCV testing among drug users is vital to earlier diagnosis, linkage to care, and retention. This study aimed to examine HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing delays at methadone clinics in Guangdong Province, China, and identify individual-level and clinic-level factors associated with delayed testing. Data from 13,270 individuals at 45 methadone clinics in Guangdong were abstracted from a national web-based surveillance database. A two-level binomial logit model was used to examine the association between individual- and clinic-level factors and delayed HIV and HCV testing, defined as receiving a test seven or more days after initial entry into the methadone system. Among 10,046 patients tested for HIV, 1882 (18.7%) had delayed testing; among 10,404 patients tested for HCV, 1542 (14.8%) had delayed testing. Among delayed testers, the median time to HCV testing was significantly longer than the median time to HIV testing (73 vs. 54 days, p<0.05). In the multivariate analysis, the likelihood of delayed HIV testing was higher among individuals with high school or greater education (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.72) and individuals enrolled at clinics with more patients (aOR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05-1.91, for each increase in 100). The likelihood of delayed HCV testing was higher among women (aOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.11-2.06) and employed individuals (aOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.43). Delayed testing for HIV and HCV is common among patients at methadone clinics in Guangdong, with many patients experiencing delays of two or more months. Structural interventions are needed to expedite testing once individuals enter the methadone maintenance program. "
16822,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Lymphoid tissue is a major reservoir of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in vivo. In addition, the lymphoid microenvironment provides a replicative advantage to the virus in that it provides a milieu of activated target cells that allows for efficient virus spread. The process of mobilization and activation of immune competent cells directed against the virus paradoxically contributes to the propagation of virus replication. Disruption of the lymphoid microenvironment during the progression of HIV disease is a poorly understood process, which may be of considerable importance pathogenically. Studies of lymph node biopsy samples taken 8 weeks apart from individuals who did not undergo any change in their therapeutic regimen (i.e., patients who either remained untreated or remained on their ongoing nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor monotherapy regimen) revealed little change in histopathology or viral load over the 8-week period. These results with successive lymph node biopsy samples taken from different sites indicate that an isolated lymph node biopsy accurately reflects the pathologic process associated with HIV infection and that this process diffusely involves the lymphoid system. Treatment with reverse transcriptase inhibitor monotherapy of patients in relatively early stage HIV disease had no detectable impact on the viral load in lymphoid tissue, suggesting the need to investigate more potent antiretroviral regimens during this stage of disease. Among patients with moderately advanced HIV disease, switching to combination therapy from a monotherapy regimen resulted in decreased viral replication in lymph nodes; this effect was associated with decreases in plasma viremia. Despite the fact that measures of viral replication decreased significantly, the net frequency of HIV-infected cells in peripheral blood and lymph nodes remained unchanged. Potent antiretroviral drug combinations may be capable of profound and long-term downregulation of plasma viremia. It will be essential to monitor the status of viral trapping, viral burden, and viral replication within lymphoid tissue during treatment with such drugs to determine accurately their true potential for impact on these key features of HIV pathogenesis."

The patients had a median age of 38 years and a median CD4 count of 198 cells/μL. In all, 44.6% (41/92) were diagnosed as asymptomatic NS (ANS), 23.9% (22/92) as syphilitic meningitis, 17.4% (16/92) as cerebrovascular NS, and 14.1% (13/92) as parenchymal syphilis. A quarter of patients (23/92) complicated with ocular syphilis (OS), 60.9% (14/23) of which were ANS. The serum tolulized red unheated serum test (TRUST) titers were ≤1:8 in 15 patients (16.3%), 1:16-1:128 in 51 patients (55.4%), and ≥1:256 in 26 patients (28.3%). Sixty-nine patients (75.0%) had both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) TRUST and Treponema pallidum particle assay reactive. CSF pleocytosis and protein elevation were found in 58.7% and 53.3% of patients, respectively. Syphilitic meningitis was more likely to present with CSF pleocytosis than ANS (P = .001), cerebrovascular NS (P < .001), and parenchymal NS (P < .001). The proportion of patients with CSF elevated protein was lower in ANS group than that in syphilitic meningitis (P = .003), cerebrovascular NS (P = .001), and parenchymal NS groups (P = .025), and was higher in sero-TRUST titers ≤1:8 group than that in 1:16-1:128 (P = .01) and 1:256-1:1024 groups (P = .005).This study revealed that ANS was the most common clinical type of NS in HIV-infected patients, which should be considered in HIV and syphilis co-infection patients without neurologic symptoms, especially in those with OS. Different patterns of NS might have different CSF features which may also vary with sero-TRUST titers."

We evaluated the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and risk factors in the HIV cohort of Sihanouk Hospital Center of Hope in Phnom Penh to strengthen the evidence for suitable HCV testing strategies among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Cambodia. All consenting adult PLWH without a history of HCV treatment were tested for HCV between November 2014 and May 2016 according to the CDC algorithm (HCV antibody II electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay, followed by COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® TaqMan® HCV PCR and INNO-LIA® HCV Score immunoblot end-testing). Genotyping was performed using the line probe assay Versant HCV genotype 2.0®. The study enrolled a total of 3045 patients (43% males, median age: 42.5 years, <1% high-risk). HCV antibodies were detected in 230 (7.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.6-8.5). Upon further testing, HCV antibodies were confirmed in 157 (5.2%; 95% CI 4.4-6.0) and active HCV in 106 (3.5%; 95% CI 2.8-4.2). Viremic prevalence peaked among men aged 50-55 years (7.3%) and women aged >55 years (11.2%). Genotype 1b (45%) and 6 (41%) were predominant. Coinfected patients had a higher aspartate-to-platelet ratio index, lower platelets, a lower HBsAg positivity rate and more frequent diabetes. Based on logistic regression, blood transfusion antecedents (adjusted odds ratio 2.9; 95% CI 1.7-4.9), unsafe medical injections (2.0; 1.3-3.2), and partner (3.4; 1.5-7.6) or household member (2.4; 1.3-3.2) with liver disease were independently associated with HCV in women. However, having a tattoo/scarification (1.9; 1.1-3.4) and household member (3.1; 1.3-7.3) with liver disease were associated with HCV in men. Thus, our study found intermediate endemicity of active hepatitis C in a large Cambodian HIV cohort and provides initial arguments for targeted HCV screening (>50 years, partner/household member with liver disease, diabetes, increased aspartate-to-platelet ratio index) as efficient way forward."

Testosterone levels of 69 HIV-infected women with low weight and weight loss were compared with levels for 25 healthy, age- and body mass index-matched control subjects. HIV-infected subjects were of low weight, with a mean (+/- standard deviation) weight loss of -17.6% +/- 9.7% from preillness maximum, and 42% of HIV-infected subjects had a body mass index of <20 kg/m(2). Forty-nine percent of the HIV-infected population versus 8% of the control population exhibited low free testosterone levels (P<.001). Among HIV-infected women, when we controlled for chronic hepatitis status, age, and time of blood sampling, weight loss of >10% of maximum weight was a significant predictor of low free testosterone levels. Free testosterone levels did not differ by drug class or antiretroviral regimen. In conclusion, decreased androgen levels are common among HIV-infected women reporting significant weight loss, independent of exposure to antiretroviral medications."

Patients on antiretroviral therapy who attended to the pharmacy during a 6-month period were considered eligible. Those included in the final analysis were patients who had been taking the same antiretroviral therapy for > or =6 months since their inclusion. The cohort included patients taking first line therapy (n = 243) and antiretroviral-experienced patients (n = 899). Naive patients who were included had to have reached undetectable VL at enrollment. Antiretroviral-experienced patients with detectable VL determinations in the previous 6 months were excluded. Adherence was measured by means of announced pill counts and dispensation pharmacy records. Of patients, 58% were taking NNRTI, 31.4% boosted PI, and 10.6% unboosted PI-based regimens. Overall, the relative risk of virologic failure was 9.0 (95% CI 4.0-20.1) in patients with adherence 80-89.9%, 45.6 (95% CI 19.9-104.5) with adherence 70-79.9%, and 77.3 (95% CI 34.2-174.9) with adherence <70%, compared with adherence of > or =90%. The risk of virologic failure in patients with adherence <90% taking unboosted PI was 2.5 times higher than the group taking boosted PI (95% CI 1.2-5.3). There were no statistical differences in patients taking boosted PI and those who were taking NNRTI. Less than 95% of adherence is associated with high virologic success. For patients taking NNRTI- or boosted PI-based regimens with adherence rates of 80%, the failure rate is <10%. These data do not affect the goal of achieving the highest level of adherence possible."

The median CD4+ cell count was 186x10(6) cells/L, and the median HIV RNA level was 5 log(10) copies/mL. After 24 months of therapy, 42 (16.5%) of 255 patients had a median CD4+ cell count increase of <100x10(6) cells/L.

However, it is unknown whether this dominance continues throughout the first year of treatment. To examine this question, 10 subjects who had a positive response to HAART for 1 year were selected from a cohort of 20 who were receiving this treatment. Flow cytometry, which was used to characterize CD4(+) T cell subsets by immunophenotype, demonstrated that cells programmed to traffic through lymph nodes, irrespective of their memory or naive phenotype, continued to best account for increases in CD4(+) T cells, even 1 year after starting HAART. This suggests that, although this pool is preferentially depleted during HIV-1 infection, HAART allows for reaccumulation of these cells for at least 1 year. Furthermore, it suggests that phenotypic differences based on markers of lymphocyte trafficking may be more relevant for understanding HIV-1 pathogenesis than are naive and memory markers alone."

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels were quantified longitudinally from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 31 HIV-1-infected children from Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trial Group Study 382 who were receiving HAART, including nelfinavir, efavirenz, and different NRTIs, and who had had undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels for >2 years. The median mtDNA levels in PBMCs increased from 137 copies/cell at the baseline to 179 copies/cell at week 48 (P = 0.01) and 198 copies/cell at week 104 (P < 0.001). Before the initiation of HAART, children who received regimens containing didanosine had mtDNA levels persistently lower than those in children not receiving didanosine (106 versus 140 copies/cell; P = 0.008). During HAART, the median increase in the mtDNA level from the baseline to week 104 was the lowest in children who received regimens containing didanosine (+26 copies/cell) compared to those in children who received other regimens (+79 copies/cell) (P = 0.02). A multivariate analysis also demonstrated that didanosine, as part of HAART, was the only NRTI associated with the change in mtDNA levels (P = 0.007). Children receiving didanosine-containing antiretroviral regimens have the lowest mtDNA levels in PBMCs and may be at greater risk for long-term adverse effects due to mitochondrial toxicity. This may be of particular importance in resource-limited countries where didanosine is widely used for the treatment of HIV-infected children."

There were two main purposes of this study: first, to gather descriptive data from major key players (with particular emphasis on nurses) concerning knowledge of the policy process and resource allocation for management and care of clients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Botswana; and, second, to identify nurse characteristics (e.g. position, education, experience, job category) associated with motivation to influence health-care policy in HIV/AIDS management and care in Botswana. A policy process conceptual framework was used to guide data collection and analysis. A case-study research method was used to conduct in-depth interviews from a purposive sample of 19 policy makers, and a survey questionnaire was used to collect data from a purposive sample of 95 registered nurses from six study sites in Botswana. The study findings indicate minimal participation of nurses in health-care policy process and resource allocation. The demographic variable of position was a predictor of the involvement of nurses in policy and in budgetary decisions. Both survey and interview data indicated that this minimal participation of nurses in the policy process resulted in implementation problems, thus compromising service provision. Implications of the findings for the nursing profession, nursing practice and policy, which address the importance of nurses' involvement, are discussed."

It was an ambispective cohort study carried out in 11 HIV units in Spain and involved 711 consecutive patients positive for HIV/HCV who started interferon plus ribavirin therapy between 2000 and 2005. We measured sustained virologic response (SVR), i.e., undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks after the end of treatment, and clinical outcomes, defined as death (liver-related or non-liver-related), liver decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation. Of 711 patients who were positive for HIV/HCV, 31% had SVR. During a mean follow-up of 20.8 months (interquartile range: 12.2-38.7), the incidence rates per 100 person-years of overall mortality, liver-related mortality, and liver decompensation were 0.46, 0.23, and 0.23 among patients with SVR and 3.12, 1.65, and 4.33 among those without SVR (P = 0.003, 0.028, and <0.001 by the log-rank test), respectively.

A total of 77 deaths were recorded among 632 drug users, for a mortality rate per 1,000 person-years of 7 for HIV-negative noninjection drug users, 18 for HIV-negative injection drug users, and 64 for HIV-positive injection drug users. In multivariate analyses, limited to injection drug users, a positive HIV serostatus, age above 40 years, and using benzodiazepines several times daily were significantly associated with an elevated risk of death, both for death from all causes and for death preceding acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) diagnosis (pre-AIDS). For pre-AIDS death, the adjusted relative risk associated with HIV infection was 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.3-3.7). Only 38% of HIV-infected injection drug users who died were diagnosed with AIDS. However, 76% of HIV-infected injection drug users who died without AIDS diagnosis had evidence of immunosuppression (CD4 count < 500/microliters).

M184V/I mutation was observed in 36 patients (87.7%) followed by T215Y/F (41.5%) and M46I/L (34%). Six months after resistance assay and HAART regimen change, median CD4+ T cell count increased from 168 cells/microL (interquartile range [IQR], 62-253) to 276 cells/microL (IQR, 153-381) and log viral load decreased from 4.65 copies/mL (IQR, 4.18-5.00) to 1.91 copies/mL (IQR, 1.10-3.60) (P<0.001 for both values). The number of patients who accomplished viral load <400 copies/mL was 26 (63.4%) at 6 months follow-up. In conclusion, many Korean HIV-1 infected patients with VF are harboring strains with multiple resistance mutations and immunologic/virologic parameters are improved significantly after genotypic resistance assay and HAART regimen change."

Satisfaction with social support (P = .029), problem-focused coping (P = .027), and active-behavioral coping (P = .011) correlated significantly with adherence, whereas loss of motivation (P = .006), hopelessness (P = .16), and avoidant coping (p = .015) correlated with nonadherence. At the 6-month follow-up, the mean CD4 cell count differed significantly among adherent versus nonadherent patients (a mean increase of 78/mm3 vs. a mean decrease of 5/mm3; P = .018). Adherence did not correlate with the number of antiretroviral medications consumed per day (mean, 3.0 vs. 2.5). Non-Caucasian patients were more likely to be nonadherent than Caucasian patients (relative risk, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-5.3; P = .013); this difference was not explained by age, education, employment, income, history of intravenous drug use, or medical regimen. Non-Caucasian patients, however, were less satisfied with their social support (P = .04) and informational support (P = .016) and were more likely to utilize emotion-focused coping (P = .01). Thus, satisfaction with social support and coping style significantly impacted adherence and likely accounted for the observed racial difference in adherence among HIV-infected patients."

However, some of these studies reported inconsistent results. Using data collected from 11 methadone clinics, we fit both a non-spatial logistical regression and a geographically weighted logistic regression to analyse the association between HCV infection and some factors at the individual level. This study enrolled 5401 patients with 30·0% HCV infection prevalence. The non-spatial logistical regression found that injection history, drug rehabilitation history and senior high-school education or above were related to HCV infection; and being married was negatively associated with HCV infection. Using the spatial model, we found that Yi ethnicity was negatively related to HCV infection in 62·0% of townships, and being married was negatively associated with HCV infection in 81·0% of townships. Senior high-school education or above was positively associated with HCV infection in 55·2% of townships of the Yi Autonomous Prefecture. The spatial model offers better understanding of the geographical variations of the risk factors associated with HCV infection. The geographical variations may be useful for customizing intervention strategies for local regions for more efficient allocation of limited resources to control transmission of HCV. "

There was a large cohort study in 16 public centres for drug users in north-eastern Italy, with data collected by standardized face-to-face interviews between February 2001 and August 2001. Of 1095 participants, 74.2% were HCV seropositive. Anti-HCV status was independently associated with duration of drug use of over 10 years, injecting as a route of drug administration, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity. Further statistical analysis was conducted by dividing the subjects on the basis of the duration of heroin use: more or <10 years. In the multivariate analyses, route of drug administration and HBV status were associated with HCV seropositivity among both groups. Less education was associated with HCV among the shorter term drug users. HIV status and having a sexual partner with a history of drug use were associated with HCV seropositivity among the longer term drug users. Half of the short-term heroin users were still HCV seronegative when starting treatment, suggesting opportunities for reducing new HCV infections. Remarkable was the relationship between vaccination for hepatitis B and HCV serostatus. Being HBV seropositive was strongly associated with being HCV seropositive. But heroin users who had been vaccinated for HBV were not significantly more likely to be HCV seropositive than heroin users who were HBV seronegative. HBV vaccination does not provide biological protection against HCV; however, vaccinating heroin users against HBV may help to create a stronger pro-health attitude among heroin users, leading to a reduction in HCV risk behaviour."

Changing to sequential or additive therapy was based on deterioration of a patient's health status, a significant drop in CD4 cell count, or intolerance for zidovudine. The median CD4 cell count at baseline was 110 x 10(6)/L; 42% of patients had AIDS. The median count before a change in therapy was 50 x 10(6)/L. Additive or sequential treatment was associated with an increased risk for death (relative hazard, 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-2.49; and 1.58; 95% CI, 1.10-2.37, respectively). Adjustment of the models for prognostic factors failed to substantially affect this observation. Possibly the lack of benefit in this study is because patients switched therapy at advanced stages, whereas the switch may be more effective in early disease."
15060,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"While the mean age of HIV/AIDS patients at first diagnosis is progressively rising, no updated epidemiological estimates, controlled clinical data, and randomized therapeutic trials, are available regarding clinical and laboratory response to antiretroviral therapy, safety of anti-HIV compounds and their associations, potential drug-drug interactions, short- and long-term toxicity, consequences on underlying disorders, or interactions with concomitant pharmacological regimens, in the elderly. The life expectancy of HIV-infected persons treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) now approximates that of general population matched for age, while also AIDS definition itself has lost most of its epidemiological and clinical significance, thanks to the immunoreconstitution resulting from the large-scale use of potent HAART regimens. The increased survival of HIV-infected patients, the late recognition of other subjects with missed or delayed diagnosis are responsible for a further expected rise of mean age of HIV-infected individuals, so that the patient population aged 60-70 years or more is expected to increase in coming years. Unfortunately, the majority of therapeutic trials involving antiretroviral therapy, as well as antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis for AIDS-related opportunistic complications, have advanced age and/or concurrent end-organ disorders among main exclusion criteria, or the design of these studies does not allow to extrapolate data regarding older patients, compared with younger ones. The very limited data presently available seem to demonstrate that HAART has a virological efficacy in the elderly comparable with that of younger adults, but immunological recovery is often slower and blunted, although several studies clearly demonstrated that thymic function is preserved until late adult age. When facing an HIV-infected patient with advanced age, health care givers have to pay careful attention to eventual end-organ disorders, all possible pharmacological interactions, overlapping toxicity due to concurrent drug administration. All these issues may significantly interfere with HAART activity, patient's adherence to prescribed medications, and frequency and severity of untoward effects. The guidelines of antiretroviral therapy and those of treatment and prophylaxis of AIDS-related diseases deserve appropriate updates, paralleling the increasing mean age of HIV-infected population. Moreover, epidemiological figures need an increased focus on older age, while clinical trials specifically targeting on the elderly population are mandatory to have reliable data on all aspects of HAART administration in advanced age."

However, the current protocol for constructing humanized mice requires elaborate procedures and complicated techniques, limiting the supply of such mice for viral studies. Here, we report a convenient method for constructing a simple HIV-1 mouse model. Without prior irradiation, NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ-null (NSG) mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1 × 10(7) adult human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hu-PBMCs). Four weeks after PBMC inoculation, human CD45(+) cells, and CD3(+)CD4(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells were detected in peripheral blood, lymph nodes, spleen, and liver, whereas human CD19(+) cells were observed in lymph nodes and spleen. To examine the usefulness of hu-PBMC-inoculated NSG (hu-PBMC-NSG) mice as an HIV-1 infection model, we intravenously injected these mice with dual-tropic HIV-1DH12 and X4-tropic HIV-1NL4-3 strains. HIV-1-infected hu-PBMC-NSG mice showed significantly lower human CD4(+) T cell counts and high HIV viral loads in the peripheral blood compared with noninfected hu-PBMC-NSG mice. Following highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and neutralizing antibody treatment, HIV-1 replication was significantly suppressed in HIV-1-infected hu-PBMC-NSG mice without detectable viremia or CD4(+) T cell depletion. Moreover, the numbers of human T cells were maintained in hu-PBMC-NSG mice for at least 10 weeks. Taken together, our results suggest that hu-PBMC-NSG mice may serve as a relevant HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis model that could facilitate in vivo studies of HIV-1 infection and candidate HIV-1 protective drugs.

We assessed the effectiveness of a lay health worker lead structured group intervention to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a cohort of HIV-infected adults. This two-arm randomized controlled trial was undertaken at an HIV clinic in a district hospital in South Africa. A total of 152 adult patients on ART and with adherence problems were randomized 1:1 to one of two conditions, a standard adherence intervention package plus a structured three session group intervention or to a standard adherence intervention package alone. Self-reported adherence was measured using the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group adherence instrument prior to, post intervention and at follow-up. Baseline characteristics were similar for both conditions. At post-intervention, adherence information knowledge increased significantly in the intervention condition in comparison to the standard of care, while adherence motivation and skills did not significantly change among the conditions over time. There was a significant improvement in ART adherence and CD4 count and a significant reduction of depression scores over time in both conditions, however, no significant intervention effect between conditions was found. Lay health workers may be a useful adjunct to treatment to enhance the adherence information component of the medication adherence intervention, but knowledge may be necessary but not sufficient to increase adherence in this sample. Psychosocial informational interventions may require more advanced skill training in lay health workers to achieve superior adherence outcomes in comparison standard care in this resource-constrained setting."

As the number of long-term survivors increases with advances in antiretroviral therapy, age-associated urologic symptoms are also becoming increasingly relevant considerations for people living with HIV. Primary care physicians have a major role to play in maintaining the genitourinary health of their HIV+ patients. This role is of great importance not just for the well-being of the individual patient but for the public health, as the genitourinary tract is a common vector for HIV transmission. In this article the authors review the management of the genitourinary system in patients with HIV infection. Particular consideration is given to urinary tract infections, lower urinary tract symptoms, renal insufficiency, sexual and fertility problems, and cancers of the genitourinary tract. Management algorithms are outlined and indications for referral to a urologist are emphasized."

Macrophage antigen presentation and effector cell functions are impaired by HIV-1 infection. Abnormalities of macrophage effector cell function in bone marrow, lung, and brain likely result as a direct consequence of cellular activation and HIV replication. To further elucidate the extent of macrophage dysfunction in HIV-1 disease, a critical activation-specific regulatory molecule, nitric oxide (NO.), which may contribute to diverse pathology, was studied. Little, if any, NO. is produced by uninfected human monocytes. In contrast, infection with HIV-1 increases NO. production to modest, but significant levels (2-5 microM). Monocyte activation (with lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or through interactions with astroglial cells) further enhances NO. production in HIV-infected cells, whereas its levels are diminished by interleukin 4. These results suggest a possible role for NO. in HIV-associated pathology where virus-infected macrophages are found. In support of this hypothesis, RNA encoding the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was detected in postmortem brain tissue from one pediatric AIDS patient with advanced HIV encephalitis. Corresponding iNOS mRNA was not detected in brain tissue from five AIDS patients who died with less significant brain disease. These results demonstrate that HIV-1 can influence the expression of NOS in both cultured human monocytes and brain tissue. This newly described feature of HIV-macrophage interactions suggests previously unappreciated mechanisms of tissue pathology that result from productive viral replication."

Moreover, HCV treatment is offered less frequently to individuals with anaemia, due to haematological side effects of the treatment regimen. This study aimed to determine the effect of HCV treatment on survival among HCV/HIV co-infected individuals with pretreatment anaemia using the Electronically Retrieved Cohort of HCV-Infected Veterans (ERCHIVES). Individuals with HCV/HIV co-infection were included in current analyses. Participants were considered treated if they were prescribed ≥ 4 weeks of HCV treatment. All-cause mortality data were obtained using record linkage. Survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models. Among 5000 HCV/HIV co-infected individuals, 1671 (33.4%) had pretreatment anaemia. In a follow-up period of up to 7 years (19,500 person-years), individuals with anaemia had significantly higher mortality rate compared with those without anaemia [144.2 (95% CI: 134.5-154.7) vs 47.5 (44.0-51.2) per 1000 person-years, respectively]. Among individuals with anaemia, HCV treatment was associated with significantly lower mortality rate [66.6 (44.3-100.2) vs 149.6 (139.2-160.5) per 1000 person-years, for treated vs untreated, respectively]. Treatment remained associated with substantial survival benefit after taking into account the effect of multiple comorbidities (hazards ratio: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.21-0.62). These data suggest that HCV/HIV co-infected individuals with pretreatment anaemia have significantly higher mortality compared with those without anaemia. HCV treatment is associated with substantial survival benefit in this group. Additional studies are needed to determine strategies to improve HCV treatment rates among this group."

We sought to determine predictors of death in a group of HIV-infected homeless persons in San Francisco. Between 1996 and 2002, quarterly interviews and blood draws were conducted. Hazards of death were compared by number of months of the prior 6 months that an individual took any ARV, drug use, hepatitis C virus (HCV) status, and housing status. Among 330 participants, 65% were HCV-seropositive at baseline, 85% received ARV during the study period, and there were 57 deaths (5.3 per 100 person-years). Compared with 0 of the prior 6 months on therapy, the risk of death was not significantly reduced for individuals on 1 to 5 months of therapy (hazard ratio [HR]=0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43-1.57), but the risk of death was reduced 62% for those on ARV therapy for 6 months (HR=0.38, CI: 0.19-0.76). Housing status and HCV status were not significant predictors of death. HIV is the major cause of death in this population, whereas the impact of HCV infection seems to be minimal. Sustained ARV treatment significantly reduces the risk of death among the homeless."

This study assessed whether non-disclosure is associated with psychological symptoms, non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and viral load (VL) non-suppression. A total of 3258 HIV-diagnosed individuals in the UK completed the confidential ASTRA study questionnaire (2011-2012). Participants reported whether they told anyone they had HIV; to which confidant(s) (friends, family, work colleagues, stable partner) and to what extent (none, some, most/all). The prevalence and factors associated with non-disclosure were assessed. Associations between non-disclosure and the following factors were established using modified Poisson regression with adjustment for socio-demographic factors (gender, age group, ethnicity), HIV-related factors (time since HIV diagnosis, ART status), and clinic: low social support (score ≤ 12 on modified Duke-UNC FSSQ); depression and anxiety symptoms (≥10 on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 respectively); self-reported ART non-adherence in past 2 weeks/3 months; VL non-suppression (clinic-recorded VL > 50 copies/mL among those who started ART ≥ 6 months ago). Among 3233 participants with disclosure data, the prevalence of non-disclosure to anyone was 16.6 % (n/N = 61/367) among heterosexual men, 15.7 % (98/626) among women, and 5.0 % (113/2240) among MSM. MSM were more likely to disclose to some/all friends compared to family (85.8 vs. 59.9 %) while heterosexuals were less likely to disclose to friends than family (44.1 vs. 61.1 % for men, 57.5 vs. 67.1 % for women). Among 1,631 participants with a stable partner, non-disclosure to a stable partner was 4.9 % for MSM, 10.9 % for heterosexual men, and 13.0 % for women. In adjusted analyses, older age (≥60 years), non-white ethnicity, more recent HIV diagnosis, and not having a stable partner were significantly associated with overall non-disclosure for MSM and heterosexual individuals. The prevalence of low social support was 14.4 %, of depression and anxiety symptoms 27.1 and 22.0 %, respectively, of ART non-adherence 31.8 %, and of viral load non-suppression on ART 9.8 %. There was no evidence that non-disclosure overall (versus disclosure to anyone) was associated with low social support, depression or anxiety symptoms, ART non-adherence or VL non-suppression among MSM or heterosexual individuals. However, compared to MSM who disclosed to 'none' or 'some' friends and family, MSM who disclosed to 'most or all' of their friends and family were more likely to have symptoms of depression (adjusted PR = 1.4, 95 % CI 1.2-1.7), anxiety (1.3, 1.1-1.6), and to report ART non-adherence (1.3, 1.1-1.5). In this large multicentre study of people living with HIV in the UK, non-disclosure was overall low, but higher for heterosexual individuals compared to MSM. Non-disclosure was not associated with higher prevalence of adverse health measures."

Urine kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) levels were measured by ELISA and expressed as a ratio to creatinine. Sixty-six patients (median age 38 years) and 10 healthy controls (median age 35.5 years) were included in the study. Patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, or kidney disease were excluded from the study. All patients received tenofovir/emtricitabine combined with one of three other components, namely efavirenz, atazanavir/norvir, or lopinavir/norvir. A lower concentration of L-FABP/creatinine was observed in HIV-infected as compared to healthy individuals (p=0.0353); KIM-1/creatinine was also lower in comparison with healthy controls but not statistically significantly. Patients receiving efavirenz had higher levels of L-FABP/creatinine in comparison to healthy controls (p=0.0039). Patients with anti-HCV had higher concentrations of L-FABP/creatinine as compared to the HIV-monoinfected individuals (not statistically significant) and to healthy subjects (p=0.0356). All four patients with L-FABP>17.5 μg/g creatinine were HIV/HCV coinfected. On multivariate logistic regression urine L-FABP above 5.5 μg/g creatinine was independently associated with body weight (OR=0.93 p=0.039). This study suggests that HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with lower body weight treated with tenofovir may be at an increased risk of tubular dysfunction and should be monitored more closely. The use of protease inhibitors was not associated with an increased risk of tubular disorders."

Our hypothesis was that the rates of low concentrations of these micronutrients would be higher in the HIV-infected group than those in the HIV-exposed, uninfected group. This was a cross-sectional substudy of a larger cohort study at clinical pediatric HIV centers in Latin America. Serum levels of micronutrients were measured in the first stored sample obtained after each child's first birthday by high-performance liquid chromatography. Low concentrations of retinol, beta-carotene, and vitamin E were defined as serum levels below 0.70, 0.35, and 18.0 micromol/L, respectively. The population for this analysis was 336 children (124 HIV-infected, 212 HIV-exposed, uninfected) aged 1 year or older to younger than 4 years. Rates of low concentrations were 74% for retinol, 27% for beta-carotene, and 89% for vitamin E. These rates were not affected by HIV status. Among the HIV-infected children, those treated with antiretrovirals were less likely to have retinol deficiency, but no other HIV-related factors correlated with micronutrient low serum levels. Low concentrations of retinol, beta-carotene, and vitamin E are very common in children exposed to HIV living in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, regardless of HIV-infection status."

We therefore compared the first episodes of PCP without prophylaxis in human immunodeficiency virus infected (HIV) and otherwise immunosuppressed patients in this retrospective study. A total of 58 HIV-infected and 16 otherwise immunosuppressed patients were analysed. The comparison included epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological and microbiological data, as well as therapy and clinical course. A prognostic analysis was performed using a logistic regression model. The mortality was significantly different in the two groups (HIV group 17 versus non-HIV group 50%). Renal transplant patients had a higher survival rate as compared to malignancy or collagen vascular disease as underlying diseases at risk. Acute respiratory failure was more common in the non-HIV group. Variables found to be significantly associated with lethal outcome in univariate analysis were alveolar to arterial pressures difference for oxygen (P(A-a),O2), haemoglobin, platelet count, total protein, serum albumin, and gamma-globulins in the HIV-group, and serum albumin in the non-HIV group. In the multivariate analysis of the HIV group, platelet count and gamma-globulins remained independent prognostic factors. In conclusion, in the HIV-group, mortality is closely related to the severeness of PCP as well as to the severeness of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) disease. In the non-HIV group, malignancy and collagen vascular disease as underlying conditions at risk account for the high mortality rate. Its severeness was mainly reflected by serum albumin, which represented the only variable found to be significantly associated with death in both groups."

Contrary to previous literature, no significant differences were detected between men (n = 42) and women (n = 36) on medication adherence or depression. Both groups showed remarkably poor adherence during baseline (M = 56% of doses taken on time), high overall prevalence of depression (47%) and illicit cocaine use (47%). Women reported significantly more medication side effects (M = 21.4 vs. 14.9), higher severity of ASI psychiatric problems (M = 0.50 vs. 0.40), and lower SF-36 health-related quality of life in physical (M = 42.1 vs. 63.3) and emotional functioning (M = 26.9 vs. 58.9) than men. Women tested positive for opioids at higher rates than men (53% vs. 29%, respectively), whereas men were more likely to be positive for benzodiazepines than women (26% vs. 6%, respectively). Findings suggest that gender differences between male and female methadone maintenance patients have relevance to treatment providers.

Aetiologies of FUO were identified in 67 patients (93%), of whom 61(85%) had an infectious aetiology. The most common infectious aetiologies were Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n=30; 42%), Cryptococcus neoformans (n=17; 24%), Pneumocystis jiroveci (n=9; 13%), Toxoplasma gondii (n=5; 7%), and salmonella bacteraemia (n=5; 7%). Nineteen patients (26%) had co-infection with two or more pathogens. The median CD4 count was 120 cells/mm(3) (range, 1-581 cells/mm(3)), and the all-cause mortality was 22% (n=16).

This study aims to evaluate the impact of HAART and review determinants of survival in a cohort of NA/AN persons receiving treatment for HIV in a real life clinical setting. A retrospective chart review of 235 HIV-infected Native Americans receiving services at an urban medical center operated by the Indian Health Service from January 1, 1981 through June 30, 2004 was conducted, providing 782.7 person-years of follow-up. The main outcome measures were time from study entry and from incident AIDS diagnosis to death. Death rates fell from 18.4 (13.3-25.4) per 100 person-years in the period prior to 1998 to 6.4 (4.6-8.8) per 100 person-years in the years 1998-2004, (RR 0.35, p < 0.0001). Factors associated with the greatest reduction in risk of death from time of study entry were current use of HAART, HR 0.13 (0.06-0.30, p < 0.001), and CD4 count >/=200 at entry, HR 0.16 (0.08-0.35, p < 0.001). Current use of HAART was the strongest predictor of survival from time of AIDS diagnosis, HR 0.11 (0.05-0.25, p < 0.001). The use of HAART therapy and CD4 count were primary predictors of survival. Earlier diagnosis and access to effective medical treatment will be key factors in reducing disparities in health brought about by HIV infection in Native American/Alaska Native communities."

Fat mass (FM) of HIV-infected patients correlated negatively with the duration of HIV infection and with the duration of highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen (r(s)=-0.448 and -0.563; p=0.032 and 0.000, respectively). Multiple linear regression results showed that FM had positive correlation with weight and bone mineral content (BMC) and had negative correlation with lean mass (LM). Total body and regional FMs were found to be significantly different among LD patients, non-LD patients, and controls-the lowest in LD patients and the highest in controls (p<0.05). Total body, trunk, and leg BMCs of LD patients were lower than those of controls (p<0.05). Lumbar bone mineral density of LD patients was lower than that of non-LD patients and controls (p=0.04 and 0.007). LM of LD patients was higher than that of non-LD patients, and trunk LM had statistical difference between the 2 groups (p=0.003). Applying DXA to assess HIV-infected patient's body composition changes could provide objective information for physicians to prevent LD and osteoporosis."
6374,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Low bone mineral density (BMD) is frequent in HIV infection regardless of the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Uncertainties remain, however, as to when in HIV infection BMD screening should be performed. We designed a prospective study to estimate the efficacy of universal BMD screening by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Since April 2009 through March 2011, HIV patients attending our Center were offered femoral/lumbar DXA to screen BMD. Low BMD for chronological age, that is significant osteopenia, was defined as a Z-score ≤ -2.0 at femur and lumbar spine. Nontraumatic bone fractures (NTBFs) were evaluated. The final sample included 163 patients. A Z-score ≤ -2.0 at any site was observed in 19.6% of cases: among these, 18.8% had no indication to DXA using current Italian HIV guidelines for BMD screening. A lower femoral Z-score was independently associated with lower BMI, AIDS diagnosis, HCV co-infection, antiretroviral treatment, and NTBFs; a lower lumbar Z-score with age, BMI, Nadir CD4 T-cell counts, and NTBFs. Prevalence of NTBFs was 27.0%, predictors being male gender, HCV co-infection, and lower femoral Z-scores. Our results suggest that measuring BMD by DXA in all HIV patients regardless of any further specification may help retrieving one-fifth of patients with early BMD disorders not identified using current criteria for selective screening of BMD."

The study objective was to describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of this population, using data from a multisite clinical cohort of patients receiving HIV care. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of men interviewed between 2010 and 2012 were compared according to their self-identified sexual orientation, followed by multivariable linear and logistic regression to assess the association of sexual orientation with CD4 cell count, viral load, hepatitis C co-infection, self-rated health, and mental health concerns after adjustment for covariates. A total of 552 men identified as heterosexual, 2,023 as gay, and 171 as bisexual. Compared to gay and bisexual men, heterosexual men were more likely to have been born outside of Canada (34.8%); more likely to report African, Caribbean, or Black ethnicity (26.4%) or Indigenous ethnicity (13.6%); and more likely to have low socioeconomic status (59.5% earning less than $20,000 per year), and/or a history of injection drug use (31.7%). Relative to gay men, heterosexual men had 5.19 times the odds of co-infection with hepatitis C virus regardless of injection drug use history (95% confidence interval = 3.87-6.96), and 40% lower odds of rating their health as excellent or good (95% confidence interval = 0.50-0.84). HIV-positive heterosexual men in Ontario constituted a socially marginalized group characterized by a high prevalence of injection drug use history and hepatitis C co-infection."

Twelve men (10%) were seropositive for HIV and 6 (5%) for HTLV-I; 1 man had possible coinfection with HIV and HTLV-I. One third of the men reported having had homosexual encounters with foreign visitors or while travelling outside Jamaica, and sexual contact with men in the U.S. was weakly associated with HIV infection (p = 0.11). The median number of partners was 12 per year (range 0-135) and a greater number of homosexual partners per year was associated with HIV seropositivity (p = 0.01). HIV seropositives also were more likely to have a history of lymphadenopathy (p = 0.07). For HTLV-I, there were no obvious risk factors identified, and age-adjusted seroprevalence was not significantly higher than that of heterosexual men. Compared to studies of homosexual men in the U.S. prior to the advent of extensive AIDS education, the Jamaican homosexual population was more sexually conservative. Despite this circumstance, HIV appears to have entered this population via sexual contact with foreign men and spread efficiently among men with a greater number of sexual partners. The frequency of bisexuality (65/125 men) and the 11% HIV prevalence in bisexual men suggest that secondary infection of female sexual partners may occur."

We report cross-sectional data (n = 2,593) from two household-based and two bar-based samples of gay/bisexual men, gathered in 1992 in Tucson, Arizona, and Portland, Oregon. The main outcome variables were prevalence of HIV antibody testing and adherence to recommended secondary prevention behaviors to prevent onset of AIDS symptoms. Approximately one-third of the gay/bisexual men in these samples do not know their current HIV status. Of the gay/bisexual men who do know that they are HIV-seropositive, approximately three-fourths adhere to each of the secondary prevention recommendations, as appropriate to their stage of disease progression. In a multivariate logistic model, three variables distinguished between HIV-seropositive men who did and did not adhere: perceived antiviral treatment norms (OR = 1.4, CI = 1.1-1.7), perceived efficacy of secondary prevention treatments (OR = 1.4, CI = 1.1-1.7), and quality of the relationship with one's health-care provider (OR = 2.5, CI = 1.6-4.0). These findings indicate that efforts to support AIDS secondary prevention behaviors can occur not only through health education to change the perceptions of at-risk communities about the options available to delay the onset of opportunistic infections among HIV-seropositive individuals but also by enhancing effective doctor/patient communication."

However, neither the magnitude of this risk nor the practices associated with it have been defined. Since dentists have numerous patients and are exposed to blood, they are likely to have the maximum risk. Therefore, we have assessed occupational risk for HCV infection among dentists in the New York City area. Individuals who admitted present or previous intravenous drug use or (men) who were homosexual or bisexual were excluded. Demographic, occupational, and behavioural data were recorded, and sera were tested for antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV). Anti-HCV was found in 8 (1.75%) of 456 dentists compared with 1 (0.14%) of 723 controls (odds ratio [OR] 12.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7 to 573). Anti-HCV was found in 4 (9.3%) of 43 oral surgeons compared with 4 (0.97%) of 413 other dentists (OR 10.5, 95% CI 1.9 to 58). Seropositive dentists claimed to have treated more intravenous drug users in the week (p = 0.04) or month (p = 0.03) before the study than did seronegative dentists. Our findings show that dentists are at increased risk for hepatitis C infection. All health-care workers should regard patients as potentially infected with a communicable bloodborne agent."
10899,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C aims to achieve viral eradication. Decreasing the number of carriers subsequently reduces the transmission of the viruses. For an individual patient, therapy is aimed at preventing cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocarcinoma. Among potential therapies, interferon alfa offers the best results. In one study involving the treatment of children from a region of intermediate endemicity, interferon alfa accelerated the clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. In long-term follow-up, the study did not show a significant difference between patients who were treated and those who were not in the rate of disappearance of serum HBV-DNA, normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels or seroconversion to antibodies to hepatitis B e antigen. The most important factors in predicting a rapid decrease in HBV replication were AI T levels more than twice normal, low levels of serum HBV-DNA (less than 100 pg/mL) and inflammatory activity on liver biopsy (chronic active hepatitis). A select group of children with HBV infection has thus been shown to benefit from interferon alfa therapy. Treatment should be administered in a dosage of 6 MU/m2 three times each week for 6 months. Chronic active hepatitis, develops in approximately 30% of children with a chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Cirrhosis due to HCV appears to be a very rare complication among children. Results of interferon alfa treatment for children with HCV are scarce. A pilot study of 12 children treated with interferon alfa in a dosage of 3 MU/m2 three times each week for 6 months showed that ALT levels normalized in approximately 90% of the patients after 15 months of follow-up. All of the patients had a decrease in the histological activity of the disease. Factors predictive of a favourable response in adults were: low levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase, young age, female sex, short duration of disease, absence of cirrhosis and low histological activity of the disease. Controlled randomized studies are needed to determine the indications for interferon alfa therapy in children infected with HCV. Available data suggest that children may have a better response than adults."

IL-8 plays an important role in the initiation and amplification of inflammatory diseases, including opportunistic infections. With the advent of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, opportunistic infections have become major health concerns. However, the role of host genetics on the occurrence of these infections has not been clearly defined. In this study, genomic DNA was extracted from 185 HIV-infected individuals in the Limpopo Province, South Africa. Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to genotype the CXCR2 +1208 T/C gene. Genotypes CC, TT, and TC were associated with chest pains, frequent headaches, loss of weight, diarrhea, and loss of appetite among HIV patients. A significant association between the CC genotype and chest pains was found (P=0.035). The TC genotype was associated with loss of appetite (P=0.044) and chest pains (P=0.042). A weak association between diarrhea and the TT genotype was found (P=0.082). No association was observed between tuberculosis and the genotypes. Immunological characteristics, such as viral load and CD4 count, were not significantly associated with the genotypes. The results of the present study suggest that carriers of the TC genotype are more susceptible to chest pain, but that this genotype confers a protective effect against loss of appetite. The CC genotype was found to confer protection against chest pain but appeared to increase susceptibility to headaches. Further studies using larger samples are necessary to confirm these results."
4134,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"The success of combination antiretroviral therapy is limited by the evolutionary escape dynamics of HIV-1. We used Isotonic Conjunctive Bayesian Networks (I-CBNs), a class of probabilistic graphical models, to describe this process. We employed partial order constraints among viral resistance mutations, which give rise to a limited set of mutational pathways, and we modeled phenotypic drug resistance as monotonically increasing along any escape pathway. Using this model, the individualized genetic barrier (IGB) to each drug is derived as the probability of the virus not acquiring additional mutations that confer resistance. Drug-specific IGBs were combined to obtain the IGB to an entire regimen, which quantifies the virus' genetic potential for developing drug resistance under combination therapy. The IGB was tested as a predictor of therapeutic outcome using between 2,185 and 2,631 treatment change episodes of subtype B infected patients from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study Database, a large observational cohort. Using logistic regression, significant univariate predictors included most of the 18 drugs and single-drug IGBs, the IGB to the entire regimen, the expert rules-based genotypic susceptibility score (GSS), several individual mutations, and the peak viral load before treatment change. In the multivariate analysis, the only genotype-derived variables that remained significantly associated with virological success were GSS and, with 10-fold stronger association, IGB to regimen. When predicting suppression of viral load below 400 cps/ml, IGB outperformed GSS and also improved GSS-containing predictors significantly, but the difference was not significant for suppression below 50 cps/ml. Thus, the IGB to regimen is a novel data-derived predictor of treatment outcome that has potential to improve the interpretation of genotypic drug resistance tests. "

We sought to determine if resistance testing in ART-naive HIV-positive pregnant women identified resistant mutations, which would modify our initial choice of therapy. A retrospective chart review was performed on all HIV-positive pregnant women seen from January 2000 to December 2001 at a university hospital. There were 72 pregnancies. Twenty-seven of 72 patients were ART naive. Genotype testing was performed in 18 of 27 naive patients. Three of 18 ART-naive patients (17%) had primary resistance (95% CI: 4%-41%) by genotype to NNRTIs. The primary mutation, G190S, conferring resistance to NNRTIs was present in 1 patient. Another had the K103N mutation. One had the K103R mutation, which conferred phenotypic resistance to NNRTIs by 8.3-fold, warranting a change in the initial regimen. In our community, resistance testing in ART-naive pregnant patients is warranted. Switching later to a more complex regimen during pregnancy may adversely affect adherence, resulting in virologic failure. Strategies to avoid prescribing a suboptimal regimen include waiting to initiate ART until the resistance testing results are available and/or beginning ART with a protease inhibitor-based regimen if the patient is already in the third trimester of pregnancy at the time of her initial clinic presentation."

Recent genome-wide scans identified IL28B gene polymorphisms that associated with HCV clearance. Whether the IL28B polymorphism is also associated with these adverse effects of IFN-α would affect its clinical usefulness. One hundred thirty-three patients were prospectively examined using the Beck Depression Inventory-II and a Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) during IFN-α treatment. The candidate C/T single-nucleotide polymorphism upstream from IL28B (rs1297860) was genotyped and assessed for association with individual items from the Beck Depression Inventory-II. We confirmed that the IL28B polymorphism was associated with differences in sustained viral response (F = 3.38; P < 0.05), with the T/T genotype faring worst. However, the T/T genotype was associated with less appetite (P < 0.05), energy (P < 0.05), and sleep complaints (P < 0.05) during treatment. Only 3.1% of patients with T/T developed major appetite complaints, whereas 10.1% and 8.9% of those with the C/T and C/C genotype did, respectively. Only 10.8% of patients with T/T developed major sleep complaints, whereas 16.1% and 20.7% of those with the C/T and C/C genotype did. However, IL28B genotype did not predict development of major depressive disorder (χ(2) = 0.12; P = 0.94). The allele (C) was associated with both better viral clearance and more subjective appetite, energy, and sleep complaints. This has implications for the management of patients with HCV. If genotyping is used to better target therapy, this may co-enrich the population for likelihood of also suffering from these side effects."

The aim of the study was to examine the factors that aid or act as barriers to adherence in a UK population of adolescents and young adults receiving ART. A cross-sectional survey was completed of 138 adolescents (12-24 years) across 14 clinical and community sites in the UK and Ireland. Analysis of results was undertaken using Chi-square testing in SPSS. Of the 138 patients, 48% were female, and 52% were born outside of the UK. Fifty-two of the 138 (43%) reported being on ART for at least 8 years. More than a third of the patients have ever interrupted treatment since initiating ART. One hundred four of the 138 (75%) patients self-reported being >85% adherent to medication for 7 day recall. Self-motivation (e.g., having a routine, specific goal) was cited as being most helpful in medication compliance (33%), followed by reminders by friends and family (25%), with 20% identifing no specific factor. Only 15% chose interventions such as an adherence diary or mobile phone reminders as helpful factors, and 1% chose healthcare professional input such as home visits. This study highlights the importance of self-motivation and social support in medication adherence in an HIV-infected adolescent population, in preference to healthcare professional input. Education and motivational strategies may confer the biggest impact on sustained ART adherence amongst this vulnerable group. "

We compared 106 of these patients consecutively admitted in 12 communities where DAART was administered (DAART group) to two matched control groups of ex-IDUs undergoing self-administered ART: 106 subjects in other 10 communities (SAT group) and 106 outpatients at hospital infectious-disease wards where community patients were referred after discharge (OUT group). We estimated the proportion of patients with high adherence and the hazard ratio (HR) of 20% or more increase in the CD4(+) cell count and of reaching an undetectable viral load. The proportion of patients with high adherence to treatment was highest in the DAART group. The probability of 20% or more increase in the CD4(+) cell count was significantly lower in the two control groups versus the DAART group (SAT group HR=0.32; OUT group HR=0.43). The HR of observing an undetectable HIV-RNA level versus DAART was significantly lower in the OUT group (HR: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-0.97) but did not reach statistical significance for the SAT group (HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.74-1.33). Our findings after a 24-month follow-up, suggest that DAART in HIV-infected patients of drug-rehabilitation communities improves adherence, immunologic, and virologic outcome toward free outpatients. Even if our retrospective 36-month data do not show a prolonged viral suppression in these patients, DAART may be considered a valuable therapeutic and educational strategy in this particular target group."

We examined the demographics, recent incarceration history, and drug and alcohol use history from the Vancouver Injection Drug User Study (VIDUS) questionnaire closest to the date of initiating antiretroviral therapy. We linked these data to the HIV/AIDS Drug Treatment Program. There were 234 VIDUS participants who accessed antiretroviral therapy through the Drug Treatment Program from August 1, 1996, to July 31, 2001. In terms of illicit drug use, 196 (84%) reported injecting heroin and cocaine at the time of initiating antiretroviral therapy. Multiple logistic regression revealed that in the 6 months prior to initiating antiretroviral therapy, alcohol use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.32; 95% CI 0.13-0.81) and incarceration (AOR 0.22; 95% CI 0.09-0.58) were independently associated with lower odds of HIV-1 RNA suppression. Factors positively associated with HIV-1 RNA suppression included: adherence (AOR 1.27; 95% CI 1.06-1.51); lower baseline HIV-1 RNA (AOR 1.30; 95% CI 1.01-1.66); highly active antiretroviral therapy (AOR 4.10; 95% CI 1.56-10.6); months on therapy (AOR 1.1; 95% CI 1.06-1.14). Among HIV-infected injection drug users who were on antiretroviral therapy, any alcohol use and incarceration in the 6 months prior to initiating antiretroviral therapy were negatively associated with achieving HIV-1 RNA suppression. In addition to addiction treatment for active heroin and cocaine use, the identification and treatment of alcohol problems should be supported in this setting. As well, increased outreach to HIV-infected drug users recently released from prison to ensure continuity of care needs to be further developed."

Students 18 years and older from eight college campuses in Houston, Texas, were invited to participate in the study. Of the 7,960 who completed a self-administered questionnaire and provided a blood sample, 5,282 U.S.- or Canadian-born participants were analyzed. Their median age was 21, 62% were female, 42% were white, 26% black, 22% Hispanic, and 10% Asian or other. Two percent reported injection drug use, 13.7% intranasal drug use, 21.2% body piercings, and 25.2% tattoos. The overall prevalence of HCV infection was 0.9% and of HBV infection was 5.2%. Higher HCV prevalence was independently associated with increasing age (odds ratio [OR] per year = 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08-1.14), history of injection drug use (OR = 18.24; 95% CI = 7.74-42.92), blood transfusion before 1991 (OR = 3.21; 95% CI = 1.02-10.12), and incarceration (OR = 3.48; 95% CI = 1.45-8.37). Among 5,066 students who denied injecting drugs, HCV prevalence was 0.8% in those who reported intranasal drug use and 0.6% each in those who reported tattoos and those who reported body piercing. Increased HBV prevalence was associated with high-risk sexual behaviors and black or Asian race. In conclusion, there was no increased risk for HCV or HBV infection in low-risk adults based solely on history of cosmetic procedures or snorting drugs. However, proper infection control practices for cosmetic procedures should be followed, illegal drug use discouraged, and hepatitis B vaccination provided to adolescents and sexually active adults."

Education about AIDS remains the most effective strategy to prevent its spread. To assess the level of knowledge and the associated attitudes about AIDS among Indians in Calcutta, 153 English-speaking adults were surveyed during April and May 1990. Sixty-five of 75 men (87%) and 77 of 78 women (99%) questioned had heard of AIDS, the majority within the past 2-3 years. Newspaper and television were the most frequently cited sources of information. Of respondents who had heard of the disease, 95% knew AIDS was transmitted by sexual intercourse; less than half, however, also knew that AIDS could not be acquired through kissing, insect bites or by using public toilets. In general, respondents had little specific knowledge regarding the symptoms of AIDS, and 29% were unaware that infected persons could be asymptomatic and appear healthy. Level of education was the only variable that independently correlated with knowledge of AIDS. More than one-third of respondents would not have dinner with or continue to work with an AIDS patient and 50% believed all AIDS patients should be quarantined. More effective and widespread public education is necessary to help slow the rapidly developing AIDS epidemic in India."

Alternative HIV care delivery models, which include substantial roles for advanced practitioners and/or coordination between specialty and primary care settings in managing HIV-infected patients, may address these needs. We aimed to systematically review the evidence on patient-level HIV-specific and primary care health outcomes for HIV-infected adults receiving outpatient care across HIV care delivery models. We identified randomized trials and observational studies from bibliographic and other databases through March 2016. Eligible studies met pre-specified eligibility criteria including on care delivery models and patient-level health outcomes. We considered all available evidence, including non-experimental studies, and evaluated studies for risk of bias. We identified 3605 studies, of which 13 met eligibility criteria. Of the 13 eligible studies, the majority evaluated specialty-based care (9 studies). Across all studies and care delivery models, eligible studies primarily reported mortality and antiretroviral use, with specialty-based care associated with mortality reductions at the clinician and practice levels and with increased antiretroviral initiation or use at the clinician level but not the practice level. Limited and heterogeneous outcomes were reported for other patient-level HIV-specific outcomes (e.g., viral suppression) as well as for primary care health outcomes across all care delivery models. No studies addressed chronic care outcomes related to aging. Limited evidence was available across geographic settings and key populations. As re-design of care delivery in the US continues to evolve, better understanding of patient-level HIV-related and primary care health outcomes, especially across different staffing models and among different patient populations and geographic locations, is urgently needed to improve HIV disease management."

The mean entry CD4 cell count was 184/mm3. Patients received 3-week cycles consisting of zidovudine plus acyclovir, dideoxyinosine, and dideoxycytidine for 1 week each. Overall, the regimen was well tolerated for up to 3 years. The principal toxicities were anemia, nausea, and vomiting; 1 patient developed retinal lesions. The mean CD4 cell count reached a peak of 64 cells/mm3 above baseline at week 8 (P = .005 compared to baseline) and remained above baseline for > 40 weeks. Patients also gained weight and had decreases in serum HIV p24 antigen. Eight patients developed opportunistic infections or tumors. Only 4 patients died during 3 years of follow-up.

A prospective, open-label, randomized (1:1), multicentre, proof-of-concept trial (VEMAN study, EUDRACT number 2008-006287-11) was conducted assigning HIV-infected naive patients to once-daily maraviroc plus lopinavir/ritonavir (MVC group) or to tenofovir/emtricitabine plus lopinavir/ritonavir (TDF/FTC group). Clinical and laboratory data were collected at baseline, and after 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks with the objective to evaluate the 48-week virological and immunological efficacy. HIV-1 DNA load and CD4(+) T-cell subsets were analysed on frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected at baseline, 4 and 48 weeks to explore the trend in HIV reservoirs. Fifty patients were randomized and included in the analysis. During follow up, HIV-1 RNA decreased similarly in both groups and, at week 48, all patients in the MVC group and 22/24 (96%) in the TDF/FTC group had < 50 copies/ml of HIV-1 RNA. CD4(+) trend during follow up was higher in maraviroc-treated patients (MVC group: 286 (183-343) versus TDF/FTC group: 199 (125-285); Mann-Whitney U-test: p 0.033). A significant 48-week increase of CCR5(+) CD4(+) T cells and CD4(+) effector memory cells was observed among maraviroc-treated patients (Wilcoxon signed rank test: p 0.016 and p 0.007, respectively). No significant variations were found in naive and central memory CD4(+) T cells. Among naive patients with an R5 virus, treatment with maraviroc and lopinavir/ritonavir was shown to provide a virological response compared to a triple therapy and a greater immunological benefit."

We retrospectively examined baseline and on-treatment factors associated with RVR (HCV RNA undetectable at week 4) and cEVR (HCV RNA undetectable at week 12, regardless of week 4 response). The analysis comprised 1550 HCV genotype-1 patients from five clinical trials, including three enriched with difficult-to-treat populations, randomized to peginterferon alfa-2a 180 microg/week plus ribavirin 1000-1200 mg/day. Overall, 15.6% achieved RVR and 54.0% achieved cEVR. Baseline factors predictive of RVR were serum HCV RNA <or= 400,000 IU/mL (OR: 7.34; P < 0.0001), alanine aminotransferase >3 x ULN (OR: 2.01; P < 0.0001), non-cirrhotic status (OR: 1.92; P = 0.0087), age <or= 40 years (OR: 1.56; P = 0.0085), white non-Latino ethnicity (OR: 1.41; P = 0.0666) and individual study (P < 0.0001). These factors plus body mass index <or= 27 kg/m(2) were predictive of cEVR. After adjusting for these factors, mean on-treatment ribavirin dose >13 mg/kg/day was predictive of RVR (OR: 1.69; P = 0.005) and cEVR (OR: 1.24; P = 0.09), whereas peginterferon alfa-2a dose reduction was not. Greater decreases in haematologic parameters were observed in patients who achieved cEVR compared with patients who did not. In conclusion, several baseline and on-treatment factors were associated with RVR and cEVR to peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin in difficult-to-treat HCV genotype-1 patients, providing important prognostic information on the antiviral response in a patient cohort that is reflective of the general chronic hepatitis C population."

Directly administered antiretroviral therapy (DAART) has garnered attention recently as a strategy to improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes in HIV-infected individuals. This review is intended to provide an update on the use of DAART and the challenges posed by this strategy, explore settings in which DAART may be used, discuss the role of antiretroviral regimens with improved pharmacokinetic features, and propose future directions for DAART strategies. DAART is modeled on directly observed therapy (DOT) for the treatment of tuberculosis. However, differences in curability, medication dosing frequency, duration of treatment, and the biologic dynamics of infection, pose unique challenges to DAART strategies. Numerous settings have been proposed for DAART, including community based outreach programs, prisons, long-term care facilities, substance abuse treatment sites, and resource-poor countries. Experience with DAART to date has been limited to pilot studies or retrospective comparisons. The prospect of simplified, once-daily antiretroviral therapy holds promise for DAART. However, improvements in antiretroviral therapy may also improve outcomes in patients taking therapy on a self-administered basis. Randomized controlled trials of DAART are needed before this strategy can be embraced in any setting. In future studies it will be important to compare DAART with self-administered therapy in terms of initial virologic and immunologic responses, durability of responses, the development of antiretroviral resistance, and cost effectiveness."

This study assesses the impact of specific treatment-related adverse events (AEs) on adherence to ART in the adult HIV patient population. A systematic review of studies involving adult HIV-infected patients aged ≥ 16 years that reported an odds ratio (OR) for factors affecting adherence to ART was conducted through a search of the EMBASE(®) and Medline(®) databases. Database searches were complemented with a search of titles in the bibliographies of review papers. Studies conducted in populations limited to a particular demographic characteristic or behavioural risk were excluded. To qualify for inclusion into a meta-analysis, treatment-related AEs had to be defined similarly across studies. Also, multiple ORs from the same study were included where study sub-groups were distinct. Random effects models were used to pool ORs. In total, 19 studies and 18 ART-related AEs were included in meta-analyses. Adherence to ART was significantly lower in patients with non-specific AEs than in patients who did not experience AEs [OR = 0.623; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.465-0.834]. Patients with specific AEs such as fatigue (OR = 0.631; 95% CI: 0.433-0.918), confusion (OR = 0.349; 95% CI: 0.184-0.661), taste disturbances (OR = 0.485; 95% CI: 0.303-0.775) and nausea (OR = 0.574; 95% CI: 0.427-0.772) were significantly less likely to adhere to ART compared to patients without these AEs. Knowledge of specific treatment-related AEs may allow for targeted management of these events and a careful consideration of well-tolerated treatment regimens to improve ART adherence and clinical outcomes."

Data from 3538 patients attending an HIV clinic in Kenya, Tanzania, or Namibia were captured through interview and medical record abstraction. Participants were categorized into three drinking categories: nondrinkers, nonharmful drinkers, and harmful/likely dependent drinkers. A proportional odds model was used to identify correlates associated with categories of alcohol use. Overall, 20% of participants reported alcohol use in the past 6 months; 15% were categorized as nonharmful drinkers and 5% as harmful/likely dependent drinkers. Participants who reported missing a dose of their HIV medications [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.67, 2.49]; inconsistent condom use (AOR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.79); exchanging sex for food, money, gifts, or a place to stay (AOR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.06, 2.32); and having a sexually transmitted infection symptom (AOR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.77) were more likely to be categorized in the higher risk drinking categories. This research highlights the need to integrate alcohol screening and counseling into the adherence and risk reduction counseling offered to HIV-positive patients as part of their routine care. Moreover, given the numerous intersections between alcohol and HIV, policies that focus on reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related risk behavior should be integrated into HIV prevention, care, and treatment strategies."

Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a common experience among HIV-positive adults and may interfere with treatment utilization. This study examined rates and correlates of treatment utilization among HIV-positive adults with CSA enrolled in a coping intervention trial in New York City. The baseline assessment included measures of treatment utilization, mental health, substance abuse, and other psychosocial factors. In 2002-2004, participants (50% female, 69% African-American, M = 42.3 +/- 6.8 years old) were recruited. Nearly all (99%) received HIV medical care. However, 20% had no outpatient visits and 24% sought emergency services in the past 4 months. Among 184 participants receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), 22% were less than 90% adherent in the past week. In a multivariable logistic regression model, no outpatient treatment was associated with African American race (AOR = 3.46 [1.42-8.40]), poor social support (AOR = 1.59 [1.03-2.45]), and abstinence from illicit drug use (AOR = 0.37 [0.16-0.85]). Emergency service utilization was associated with HIV symptoms (AOR = 2.30 [1.22-4.35]), binge drinking (AOR=2.92 (1.18-7.24)), and illicit drug use (AOR = 1.98 [1.02-3.85]). Poor medication adherence was associated with trauma symptoms (AOR = 2.64 [1.07-6.75]) and poor social support (AOR = 1.82 [1.09-2.97]). In sum, while participants had access to HIV medical care, a sizable minority did not adhere to recommended guidelines and thus may not be benefiting optimally from treatment. Interventions targeting HIV-positive adults with CSA histories may need to address trauma symptoms, substance abuse, and poor social support that interfere with medical treatment utilization and adherence."

Identifying factors that influence medication adherence among African Americans is a critical step toward reducing HIV/AIDS disease progression and mortality. In a sample of 181 African American (n=144) and Caucasian (n=37) HIV-positive drug-using individuals [age (M=42.31; SD=6.6) education (M=13.41; SD=2.1)], we examined the influence of baseline drug use, literacy, neurocognition, depression, treatment-specific social support, and patient satisfaction with health care provider on medication adherence averaged over the course of 6 months (study dates 2002-2006). Our findings suggest differential baseline predictors of medication adherence for African Americans and Caucasians, such that patient satisfaction with provider was the strongest predictor of follow-up medication adherence for African Americans whereas for Caucasians depressive symptoms and treatment-specific social support were predictive of medication adherence (after controlling for duration of drug use)."
6752,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"One third of HIV-infected individuals worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Two main reasons justify considering HCV therapy as a priority in HIV-coinfected patients. First, these patients have more rapid liver disease progression, and second, they have a higher risk of developing hepatotoxicity following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Unfortunately, HCV therapy is associated with lower response rates and higher rate of side effects in HIV-coinfected patients. However, recent evidence suggests that when HCV therapy is administered adequately (to optimal candidates; using full doses of ribavirin; at least for 12 months irrespective of the HCV genotype; and with satisfactory drug adherence), treatment responses may not differ much from those seen in HCV-monoinfected individuals. Treatment should be considered up front in antiretroviral-naive subjects with stable HIV infection. In patients already on antiretroviral therapy, HCV therapy should not be administered before replacing didanosine by another antiretroviral, given the increased risk of mitochondrial toxicities. If possible, zidovudine should be avoided as well, given the high risk of anemia. The histological information provided by either non-invasive procedures (FibroScan, Fibro-test, etc.) or liver biopsy is useful but should not be considered as mandatory before prescribing HCV therapy. In summary, liver disease associated to HCV is a growing problem among HIV-positive individuals. The relatively low efficacy of current anti-HCV medications and their low tolerability clearly indicated the need for new drugs with more potent and direct antiviral activity against HCV."

Coinfection with both viruses may lead to end-stage liver disease (ESLD), including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV infection is altered by HIV presence, although the effect of HCV on HIV infection is still controversial. For this reason, HCV screening is recommended in all HIV-infected persons. The final goal of HCV treatment is to eradicate the virus or, in other words, to eliminate the infection, and this objective is especially important in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, because they have more severe liver disease, achieve less frequently sustained virologic response on treatment, and have limited access to orthotopic liver transplantation with respect to HCV-monoinfected patients. Combination therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha (pegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV) has become the standard treatment for chronic HCV infection. However, when we compare coinfected with monoinfected patients, this regimen has decreased efficacy, and the rate of adverse effects is higher."

HCV coinfection is linked to increased hepatic fibrosis progression, leading to development of cirrhosis and liver failure earlier than in HCV monoinfected patients. Initiation of highly active antiretroviral treatment regimens may paradoxically increase HCV loads. Some data suggest that HCV coinfection may hasten progression of AIDS, but this remains controversial. Three major randomized clinical trials demonstrate improved efficacy of peginterferon with ribavirin for treatment of HCV in coinfected subjects compared to those with HCV alone. However, response rates are lower than those observed in patients with HCV monoinfection. Sustained virologic response rates of 27% to 40% are reported."

The program served 2116 youth who were 19.8 +/- 2.9 years old; 64% female; 45% youth of color; 16% gay/lesbian, bisexual, or undecided; and 10% homeless or runaway. At first contact with the program, 56% received outreach services; and 91% received a health intervention. Among those receiving a health intervention, 55% had HIV counseling and testing services, 49% medical care, 24% case management, and 9% mental health services. HIV-positive youth needed more contacts before a first medical visit than those who were HIV-negative or untested (p < 0.001). Different kinds of service sites reached different populations of at-risk youth. Logistic regression modeling showed that for young women, older age, lesbian-bisexual orientation, substance use, high-risk sexual behaviours, and receiving outreach services at first contact were independent predictors of initiation of services at outreach agencies; however, unprotected sex with males, and pregnancy were associated with a greater likelihood of care at hospitals or community health centers. For young men, older age, Asian/other ethnicity, and substance abuse were associated with care at outreach agencies; however, positive HIV status and unprotected sex with females were associated with care at hospitals or community health centers. Comprehensive networks of care offering a continuum of services and a variety of entry routes and types of care sites are needed to connect underserved youth to health care."

Genotyping of interleukin 28B (IL-28B) rs12979860 polymorphism is a useful tool for guiding therapeutic decisions in this disease. On the contrary, there is not enough information on the pathogenic role of this polymorphism in the natural history of the disease. The objective of this study is to describe the relationships between the CT/TT genotype of this polymorphism with viral loads and also with a number of biomarkers of liver function in coinfected patients naïve for treatment for HCV. Seventy-five HCV/HIV coinfected patients were retrospectively recruited in our Hospital from 2010 to 2011. Logistic regression analysis adjusting by [Age], [Sex], [HCV viral genotype], [HCV viral load], [HIV viral load], and [CD4 T cells levels] revealed the IL-28B rs12979860 (CT/TT) genotype as a protective factor against alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (>100 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (>75 IU/L), and AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) score for liver fibrosis (>1.5) [OR, (95% CI), p]: ALT [0.026 (0.001-0.576) 0.021]; AST [0.001 (0.000-0.297) 0.019]; APRI [0.031 (0.002-0.41) 0.008]. Stepwise regression analysis considering the same adjusting variables showed the same results.

We re-vaccinated 57 non-responders with the same schedule. The 39.2% overall response rate to vaccination included 36% after three and 40.7% after four doses, namely, a median anti-HBs level of 100 IU/mL (range, 10 to 1000 IU/mL). The 51% revaccination response rate achieved a median hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) level of 99 IU/mL (range, 11 to >1000 IU/mL). Upon univariate analysis, variables associated with a higher response were: better liver function (Child-Pugh class [A, 53.8% B, 33.3%, C, 30.1%; P = .002), Model for End-stage Liver-Disease (MELD) score (11.4 versus 13.6; P = .001]), absence of diabetes (43.6% versus 20.8%; P = .002), presence of isolated hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positivity (80% versus 37.7%; P = .007), and younger age (< 45 years, 52.2%; range, 45 to 55 years, 40.4%; > 55 years, 34.1%; P = .031). Upon multivariate logistic regression analysis, lower MELD score (odds ratio [OR]: 0.922; P = .046), absence of diabetes (OR:0.359; P = .008) and isolated anti-HBc positivity (OR:5.826; P = .034) were associated with a higher response. No differences were observed to be associated with gender, weight, body mass index, etiology or tobacco consumption. Among the same patient cohort (n = 79), the responses after the third and fourth doses were 36.7% and 51.9% respectively. In conclusion, the response rate to HBV vaccination in cirrhotic patients evaluated for OLT reached more than 35% among those who received at least 3 doses. It was higher among patients who showed isolated anti-HBc positivity, better liver function, younger age, and non-diabetic status. The fourth dose only increased the response rate by 24% over that obtained after the first three doses, whereas a revaccination achieved a 50% response rate, which probably accounts for revaccination after no response to 3 doses. Vaccination should be introduced against HBV in the early stages of the disease."

Despite the success of universal hepatitis B vaccination in many countries, more than 350 million individuals worldwide are chronically infected and 15- 40% of those will develop cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma if left untreated. Available therapies for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection are effective at decreasing viremia and improving measured clinical outcomes, however, no single therapy is optimal. As such, alternative drug therapies and the investigation of their role in the management of CHB are warranted. Significant improvements in the understanding of the HBV life cycle, viral genomics, and virus-host interactions continue to lead to the development of novel viral targets and immune modulators. Currently, two major classes of agents are utilized in CHB: the interferons and the nucleos(t)ide analogues. Each agent has individual advantages and drawbacks. The development of specific antiviral therapy has led to the emergence of HBV drug-resistant strains that has limited the long-term therapeutic potential of available agents. This necessitates the development of new agents that target both wild-type and drug-resistant strains. Further understanding of the basic mechanisms and clinical nuances of drug therapy is warranted. As most novel therapies are in the earliest stages of clinical development and testing, in the near future, treatment will continue to be long-term and likely involve the use of combination therapies to prevent viral resistance. In this review, we will highlight the HBV life cycle and genome, focusing in on current and potential novel antiviral drug targets as well as the benefits and clinical challenges with these therapies."

Two common genetic variants (rs3077 and rs9277535) of human leukocyte antigen DP (HLA-DP) have been reported to be associated with persistent HBV infection in populations of Japan and Thailand. To confirm whether the association can be replicated in Chinese populations, an independent case-control study were conducted, and two polymorphisms (rs3077 and rs9277535) were genotyped using the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay in 282 persistent chronic HBV carriers and 64 spontaneously HBV recovered carriers. To provide a more definitive conclusion, a meta-analysis combining and summarizing five studies was performed by random-effects model using the DerSimonian and Laird's method. By using logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates, including age, sex, and alcohol consumption, the results of our independent case-control study showed that the minor allele's homozygote (AA genotype) of rs3077 and rs9277535 was significantly associated with decreasing risk/protection of HBV persistent chronic infection (for rs3077: P=0.0017, OR=0.29, 95% CI=0.13-0.62; for rs9277535, P=0.0004, OR=0.26, 95% CI=0.12-0.54). The results of meta-analysis pooling all eligible studies also showed that rs3077-A and rs9277535-A alleles were associated with an increased clearance rate to HBV infection (rs3077: OR=0.57, 95% CI=0.44-0.75; rs9277535: OR=0.56, 95% CI=0.47-0.63). These results further confirmed the strong influence of HLA-DP gene variants on risk of spontaneous HBV clearance from persistent HBV infection.

TIs typically result in viral rebound and worsening immunosuppression, which in turn are risk factors for neurocognitive decline and dementia. We sought to determine the extent of neurocognitive risk with TIs and subsequent reintroduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) by using a comprehensive, sensitive neuropsychological assessment and by concurrently determining changes in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral load and CD4 counts. Prospective, serial, clinical evaluations including neuropsychological (NP) testing and measurement of plasma HIV RNA and CD4 count and mood state were performed on HIV-1-infected individuals (N=11) at three time points: (1) prior to a TI, while on HAART; (2) after TIs averaging 6 months; and (3) after reinitiating HAART therapy. During TI, plasma HIV RNA increased and CD4 counts declined significantly, but NP performance did not change. Following reinitiation of HAART, viral loads fell below pre-TI levels, and CD4 counts rose. Improved viral suppression and immune restoration with reinitiation of HAART resulted in significant improvement in neurocognitive performance. No changes on comprehensive questionnaires of mood state were observed in relation to TI.NP performance and mood state remained stable during TIs despite worsened viral loads and CD4 counts. Because ""practice effects"" are generally greatest between the first and second NP testing sessions, improvement at the third, post-TI time point was unlikely to be accounted for by practice. TIs of up to 6 months appear to be neurocognitively and psychiatrically safe for most patients."

In addition, no comparative clinical studies about the disease in HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected patients have been reported. During a 24-year period, 120 cases of visceral leishmaniasis were diagnosed at our institution and 80 (66%) were associated with HIV infection. The mean age at diagnosis was higher in HIV-infected that in non-HIV-infected patients (33.2 versus 23.2 yr; p = 0.002), but the male/female ratio was similar in both groups. The main risk factor for HIV infection was intravenous drug abuse (78.7%). The clinical presentation of leishmaniasis was similar in both groups, but HIV-infected patients had a lower frequency of splenomegaly than HIV-negative individuals (80.8% versus 97.4%; p = 0.02). HIV-infected patients had a greater frequency and degree of leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Most of them were profoundly immunosuppressed (mean CD4+ lymphocyte count, 90 cells/mm3) at the time of diagnosis of leishmaniasis, and 53.7% had AIDS. The sensitivity of serologic studies for Leishmania was significantly lower in HIV-infected than in non-HIV-infected patients (50% versus 80%; p < 0.001), but the diagnostic yield of bone marrow aspirate (67.1% versus 79.4%) and bone marrow culture (62.9% versus 66.6%) was similar in both groups. After initial treatment, the response rate was significantly lower in HIV-infected than in non-HIV-infected individuals (54.8% versus 89.7%; p = 0.001). The relapse rate was 46.2% and 7.5%, respectively (p < 0.001). Secondary prophylaxis with antimonial compounds or amphotericin B seems to be useful in preventing relapses in HIV-infected patients. The mortality rate was higher (53.7% versus 7.5%; p < 0.001) and the median survival time shorter (25 versus > 160 mo; p < 0.001) in AIDS patients than in HIV-negative individuals. Although leishmaniasis could contribute to death in a significant number of HIV-infected patients, it was the main cause of death in only a few of them. The CD4+ lymphocyte count and the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy and secondary prophylaxis for leishmaniasis were the most significant prognostic factors for survival in AIDS patients. Visceral leishmaniasis behaves as an opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals and should be considered as an AIDS-defining disease."

It is therefore important to ensure optimal dental care of this group of people, especially since more of them, with or without knowledge of their serologic status, are now utilizing dental services. The objective of this study was to assess Nigerian dental students' willingness to treat HIV-positive individuals. A descriptive cross-sectional survey of all seventy-six final-year dental students of the University of Benin, Nigeria, was conducted in December 2007 using a self-administered questionnaire that elicited information on the students' demography, self-rated knowledge on HIV/AIDS, attitude towards homosexuals, infection control practices, occupational risk perception, and willingness to provide care for HIV-positive individuals. The response rate was 76.3 percent. Over 77 percent of the respondents were in the twenty-five to thirty years age group. The male-female ratio was approximately 1.6:1. HIV-related knowledge was reported as high by only 31 percent of the respondents. Eighty-one percent showed great interest in HIV-related information, while about half (53.4 percent) exhibited significant worry about occupational contagion. Forty-eight (82.7 percent) desired more knowledge about safety precautions during treatment of HIV patients. Fifty respondents (86.2 percent) reported good infection control practices. About three-fourths (74.2 percent) rated the risk of HIV contagion from patients high, while only one-fourth (25.8 percent) reported having an unsympathetic attitude towards homosexuals. Almost all respondents (98.3 percent) agreed that oral care for HIV-positive individuals improves their quality of life, but only 58.8 percent expressed a willingness to treat HIV-positive patients and only 46.5 percent said they will render volunteer dental services in HIV centers. HIV prevalence will determine the location of practice of 41.4 percent of the respondents. The result suggests the need to have a comprehensive educational/motivational program for the next generation of dentists in Nigeria in order to ensure adequate care of HIV-positive individuals. The perceived deficiency revealed in this study can also serve as a vital guide for curriculum change on HIV-related issues."

The study population included 404 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men and 609 HIV-infected women who 1) had a CD4 cell count measurement available from their last pre-HAART study visit, 2) provided at least four post-HAART CD4 cell count measurements, and 3) reported HAART usage for at least 80% of the post-HAART visits. The CD4 cell count trajectory was analyzed by means of a Bayesian random change-point model. The results indicated that CD4 cell count trajectories for long-term frequent HAART users can be well modeled with change points at both the population and individual levels. At the population level, regardless of CD4 cell count before HAART initiation, the gains in CD4 cell count ended approximately 2 years after HAART initiation in both men and women. At the individual level, 35% of men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study versus 25% of women in the Women's Interagency HIV Study had a statistically significant change in CD4 cell count trajectory within 7 years after HAART initiation."
5631,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"CD8(+) T lymphocytes play a pivotal role in controlling human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 replication in vivo. We have performed four-color flow cytometric analysis of CD8(+) peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 21 HIV-1 seronegative and 103 seropositive individuals to explore the phenotypic heterogeneity of CD8beta-chain expression on CD8(+) T lymphocytes and to clarify how its expression on CD8(+) T lymphocytes may relate to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) clinical progression. We showed that the single monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 2ST8-5H7, directed against the CD8alpha beta-heterodimer, identifies CD8(+) T lymphocytes as effectively as the conventional combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD8alpha antibodies. However, we detected a significantly lower mean fluorescence (MF) of anti-CD8alpha beta staining on PBL from HIV-1 seropositive donors as compared with seronegative donors. In fact, CD8(+) T lymphocytes from HIV-1-infected individuals with the lowest CD4 counts showed the lowest levels of CD8alpha beta MF. To explore further this change in CD8alpha beta expression, we assessed the expression of 14 different cell surface molecules on CD8alpha beta+ T lymphocytes of PBL from 11 HIV-1 seronegative and 22 HIV-1 seropositive individuals. The MF of anti-CD8alpha beta staining was significantly reduced on CD8(+) T lymphocyte subsets that showed immunophenotypic evidence of activation. The subset of lymphocytes expressing low levels of CD8alpha beta expressed higher levels of activation, adhesion, and cytotoxic-associated molecules and was predominantly CD45RO+ and CD28(-). Finally, we monitored the expression of the CD8alpha beta-heterodimer on PBL of eight HIV-1-infected individuals over a 16-week period after the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), including zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), and indinavir (IDV), and found a significant increase in the expression of the CD8alpha beta-heterodimer. These results suggest that antibodies recognizing the CD8alpha beta-heterodimer are useful tools to specifically identify CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Moreover, the quantitative monitoring of CD8alpha beta expression allows the detection of discrete CD8(+) T lymphocyte subsets and may be useful for assessing the immune status of individuals infected with HIV-1."

End points were diagnosis of AIDS and a CD4 cell count of < 100 x 10(6) cells/L. HCV antibodies were detected in 214 persons (51.4%). The crude relative hazard (RH) of progression to AIDS was 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-1.76) for HCV-coinfected participants compared with those not coinfected. After adjustment for CD4 cell count, the RH was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.52-1.79). Similar RHs were found using a CD4 cell count of < 100 x 10(6) cells/L as the end point. The median CD4 cell loss was 4.83 x 10(6) cells/L per month among coinfected persons and 5.70 x 10(6) cells/L per month among the others. These results suggest that coinfection with HCV does not influence clinical and immunologic progression of HIV disease."

Available information about patients' characteristics and their clinical course has been obtained mainly from case reports and small retrospective studies. Our retrospective study is the largest in the literature providing detailed information about the clinical and laboratory characteristics of HIV-infected patients with different musculoskeletal infections. We identified 30 patients with various infections of the musculoskeletal system during a 5-year period among a cohort of 3,000-4,000 HIV-infected patients, and we describe them along with all cases of musculoskeletal infections in patients with HIV reported in the literature since 1985. Septic arthritis was the most commonly reported infection of the musculoskeletal system. It usually affects young men with a median CD4 count of 241. The exact contribution of a previous history of intravenous drug abuse in the pathogenesis of septic arthritis is unclear from the present and previous studies. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated agent (31.3%). Numerous atypical pathogens were also identified as causes of septic arthritis. Approximately 90% of patients recovered with appropriate antibiotic treatment. Osteomyelitis was a more serious infection which also affected young individuals but with lower CD4 counts (median, 41). Half the cases were due to atypical mycobacteria. The mortality rate in the previously reported cases and in our series was high (20%). Pyomyositis is an increasingly recognized infection of the striated muscles in HIV-infected patients. It affects almost exclusively males with advanced HIV infection (median CD4 count, 24). Most cases are due to Staphylococcus aureus (67%). Drainage of the involved muscle(s) accompanied by proper antibiotic treatment resulted in resolution of the infection in the majority of patients (90%). Although the incidence of musculoskeletal infections in patients with HIV from this and previous studies appears to be low (0.3%-3.5%), these infections add a significant morbidity and mortality in the affected individuals. Better understanding of their pathogenesis and clinical course would aid the proper diagnosis and management of these infections."

We sought to determine the individual and combined effects of MI and DU on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) receipt and HIV-RNA suppression among individuals engaged in HIV care. Using 2004 data from the HIV Research Network (HIVRN), we performed a cross-sectional study of HIV-infected patients followed at seven primary care sites. Outcomes of interest were HAART receipt and virological suppression, defined as an HIV-RNA <400 copies/ml. Independent variables of interest were: (1) MI/DU; (2) DU only; (3) MI only; and (4) Neither. We used chi-squared analysis for comparison of categorical variables, and logistic regression to adjust for age, race, sex, frequency of outpatient visits, years in clinical care, CD4 nadir, and study site. During 2004, 10,284 individuals in the HIVRN were either on HAART or HAART eligible defined as a CD4 cell count < or =350. Nearly half had neither MI nor DU (41%), 22% MI only, 15% DU only, and 22% both MI and DU. In multivariate analysis, co-occurring MI/DU was associated with the lowest odds of HAART receipt (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 0.63 (95% CI: (0.55-0.72]), followed by those with DU only (0.75(0.63-0.87)), compared to those with neither. Among those on HAART, concurrent MI/DU (0.66 (0.58-0.75)), DU only (0.77 (0.67-0.88)), were also associated with a decreased odds of HIV-RNA suppression compared to those with neither. MI only was not associated with a statistically significant decrease in HAART receipt (0.93(0.81-1.07)) or viral suppression (0.93 (0.82-1.05)) compared to those with neither. Post-estimation testing revealed a significant difference between those with MI/DU and DU only, and MI/DU and MI only. Co-occurring MI and DU is associated with lower HAART receipt and viral suppression compared to individuals with either MI or DU or neither. Integrating HIV, substance abuse, and mental healthcare may improve outcomes in this population."

A linear correlation was observed between the decrease in serum beta(2)-microglobulin concentration (an independent surrogate marker of HIV disease) and the increase in peripheral blood T-cells (CD4(+) and CD8(+)) counts. In vitro, HIV protease inhibitors indinavir and saquinavir (but not nucleoside analogues) enhanced the survival of patients' peripheral blood T cells at doses that are at least 30-fold lower than those required for achieving 90% viral inhibition in the same cultures. This enhanced T-cell survival (which is similar for CD4 and CD8 cells) was associated with a restoration of T-cell proliferative response to immune stimuli. However, neither TCR/CD3-ligation- nor Fas-ligation-triggered apoptosis was affected by either of the 2 protease inhibitors. A reduction in apoptosis observed after prolonged culture of patient T cells in the presence of the protease inhibitors could result from restored T-cell proliferation. These findings explain the discrepancies between virologic and immunologic responses that are increasingly reported in patients receiving HAART, and may provide insights into the pathogenesis of HIV infection."

The impact of HIV/AIDS-specific pharmacy services on patient adherence and HIV viral suppression is currently not well described. This study aimed to compare the impact of differing levels of HIV-pharmacy care on adherence and time to HIV viral suppression among participants on HAART enrolled in a population-based HIV/AIDS drug treatment programme in British Columbia. We performed a retrospective observational study of 788 treatment-naïve patients who started HAART between August 1997 and July 2000 and were followed until 31 March 2002. The degree of outpatient pharmacy care was defined according to pharmacy dispensing site for the participants' first prescription of HAART: highest at the AIDS-tertiary care hospital outpatient pharmacies, intermediate at HIV/AIDS drug treatment programme funded off-site pharmacies and lowest at family physician's offices. Cox-proportional hazard models examined the independent effect of pharmacy dispensing site on time to two consecutive HIV viral suppressions controlling for other prognostic factors including physicians' experience, age, gender, injection drug use, use of therapy containing NNRTI versus PI, adherence >90%, AIDS diagnosis at baseline, baseline CD4 cell count and HIV viral load. The median time on antiretrovirals was 28 months (IQR=14-38). There were 489 (62.1%) participants who obtained their medications from the AIDS-tertiary care outpatient pharmacies; 98 (12.4%) from off-site pharmacies and 201 (25.5%) from their physicians' offices. The proportion of patients exhibiting >90% adherence to treatment was observed to be higher among patients receiving their HAART at the AIDS-tertiary care pharmacies compared to off-site pharmacies and to physicians' offices (70.4, 59.2 and 55.7%, respectively; p=0.0001). After adjusting for other prognostic factors, subjects who were first dispensed medications from the AIDS-tertiary care pharmacy were 1.42 times (CI: 1.10-1.84) more likely to achieve HIV viral suppression than those getting their medications from off-site pharmacies and physicians' offices. Providing regular outpatient pharmacy care is independently associated with improved HIV viral load response through enhanced adherence to HAART. Standardization of pharmacy practices for dispensing HAART may improve outcomes for patients who receive their HIV medications from other non-tertiary care pharmacy sites."

The HAVCR1 gene region was identified as a candidate for hepatitis C virus (HCV) natural clearance in a genotyping study of selected immune response genes in both European-American and African-American populations. The aim of the present study was to explore the influence of HAVCR1 in the outcome of HCV infection in the Spanish population. Three cohorts, consisting of 354 subjects with persistent HCV infection (285 with persistent HCV monoinfection and 69 with natural clearance), 182 coinfected HIV/HCV patients, and 320 controls, were included. Samples were genotyped in several polymorphic positions, insertion/deletion variants in exon 4 and tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in order to define previously described HAVCR1 haplotypes (haplotypes A to D). No statistically significant differences were observed with spontaneous resolution of infection or with viral clearance after treatment. Nevertheless, different rates of infection by viral genotypes (G's) were observed among the HAVCR1 haplotypes. Individuals bearing haplotype C had the highest viral G1 infection rate when compared to individuals bearing other haplotypes (75.82% versus 57.72%, respectively; corrected P value [P(c)], 3.2 × 10(-4); odds ratio [OR], 2.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.51 to 3.47).

The present study examined the psychological and social factors related to HIV risk among 153 African-American inner-city women who completed measures of HIV risk history, sexual and substance use behaviors, perceived risk for HIV infection, self-efficacy to reduce risk (belief that one can effectively perform specific behaviors), and perceived social norms supporting risk reduction. Fifty-five percent of the women (n = 84) reported at least one factor that had placed them at known risk for HIV infection. Results of a stepwise regression analysis showed that HIV risk history was associated with self-perceived risk for HIV infection and self-efficacy to perform risk-reducing actions. Social norms for safer sex did not contribute significantly to the explained variance. Women at risk were more likely to have been forced or coerced into unwanted sex and were less likely to have been familiar with their most recent sex partner. These result suggest that HIV risk-reduction interventions targeting inner-city women should focus on skills training approaches to build self-efficacy and empower women to adopt risk-reducing practices."

The aim of this study was to investigate depression, health status, and substance use in relation to HIV-infected and uninfected individuals in South Africa. Using a cross-sectional case-control design, we compared depression, physical health, mental health, problem alcohol use, and tobacco use in a sample of HIV-infected (N = 143) and HIV-uninfected (N = 199) respondents who had known their HIV status for two months. We found that depression was higher, and physical health and mental health were lower in HIV-positive than HIV-negative individuals. Poor physical health also moderated the effect of HIV infection on depression; HIV-positive individuals were significantly more depressed than HIV-negative controls, but only when general physical health was also poor. We did not find an association between alcohol or tobacco use and HIV status. These results suggest the importance of incorporating the management of psychological health in the treatment of HIV."

Ninety-nine patients from an outpatient clinic, all undergoing antiretroviral therapy, participated. Questionnaires were answered twice at a 12-month interval. The 29-item Sense of Coherence (SOC) Scale was used for measuring the ability to cope with stressful life situations. Medication adherence was assessed with self-reported measurements. Clinical characteristics and background variables were collected from the medical records. Results from variables measured with the 12-month interval show a significant concordance with disease stage (p < or = 0.0001), and in HIV-RNA copies per milliliter (p < or = 0.0001) and an increase in CD4 cell count/mm3 (p = < 0.0001). Univariate analysis showed significant differences between nonadherent patients (n = 19) and adherent patients (n = 80) at the last measurement (i.e., the nonadherent group had lower CD4 cell count/mm3 [p = 0.004], higher HIV-1 RNA levels [p 50.029], and lower SOC [p = 0.04] than the adherent group). Finally, multiple regression analyses showed that at measurement 2 the SOC predicted nonadherence, the lower SOC the more missed doses (p < or = 0.01). Because SOC seems to play an important role in this group of patients managing their disease, a caring patient-provider relationship should be developed to minimize nonadherent behaviour. For this reason SOC scale might be of great clinical value to identify patients needing the most support for successful treatment."

ITX5061 is a scavenger receptor class B type I antagonist that blocks HCV entry and infection in vitro. We assessed the safety and efficacy of ITX5061 to limit HCV infection of the graft. The study included 23 HCV-infected patients undergoing liver transplantation. The first 13 ""control"" patients did not receive drug. The subsequent 10 patients received 150 mg of ITX5061 immediately before and after transplant and daily for 1 week thereafter. ITX5061 pharmacokinetics and plasma HCV RNA were quantified. Viral genetic diversity was measured by ultradeep pyrosequencing (UDPS). ITX5061 was well tolerated with measurable plasma concentrations during therapy. Although the median HCV RNA reduction was greater in ITX-treated patients at all time points in the first week after transplantation, there was no difference in the overall change in the area over the HCV RNA curve in the 7-day treatment period. However, in genotype (GT) 1-infected patients, treatment was associated with a sustained reduction in HCV RNA levels compared to the control group (area over the HCV RNA curve analysis, P = 0.004). UDPS revealed a complex and evolving pattern of HCV variants infecting the graft during the first week. ITX5061 significantly limited viral evolution where the median divergence between day 0 and day 7 was 3.5% in the control group compared to 0.1% in the treated group. In conclusion, ITX5061 reduces plasma HCV RNA after transplant notably in GT 1-infected patients and slows viral evolution. Following liver transplantation, the likely contribution of extrahepatic reservoirs of HCV necessitates combining entry inhibitors such as ITX5061 with inhibitors of replication in future studies."

We followed an open cohort of patients from a public teaching hospital AIDS outpatient clinic. Patients were categorized according to adherence as: regular (Reg), optimal, all doses all days, tolerating only irregular timing (+/- 2 hours) of intake; quasi-regular (qReg), those missing up to four doses or 1 full day during a month; irregular (Irreg), all other irregular regimens, and ignored (Ign), those without information. The results from a simple questionnaire were compared to CD4+ cell counts and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA plasma viremia. One hundred eighty-two HIV-1-infected patients (126 males, 69%; 56 females, 31%) were analyzed. Information on adherence was available for 168 (90%). Reg adherence was reported by 75 (41%) patients, qReg adherence by 35 (19%), and Irreg by 53 (29%) of patients. The main reasons for nonadherence were forgetfulness, intolerance, use of alcohol, and misunderstanding of prescription. A significant increase of CD4+ T-cell counts and absolute gain were only observed among Reg and qReg users (p < 0.001). The median viral RNA load log10 decreases were -1.68, -1.45, -0.9 log, respectively, for Reg, qReg, and Irreg patients (p = 0.043, Kruskal-Wallis). Development of and death from AIDS occurred almost exclusively among those with Ign or Irreg adherence. Previous use of antiretroviral therapy may have had an impact in treatment response. Individuals who were treatment-naive were more likely to be Reg users (41%). Although more refined methods to assess adherence should be implemented when available, the inability to do so should not prevent simple, albeit subjective measurements that also correlate with favorable outcome. Mechanisms to improve adherence should be considered an integral part of antiretroviral therapy."

Thus, we assessed factors, particularly history of a substance use disorder, associated with time to loss of measures of physical or mental independence among HIV-positive individuals. Data were obtained from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to estimate the time since HIV diagnosis to loss of independence, and to identify associated risk factors. HIV-positive participants who self-identified as physically (n = 698) or mentally (n = 616) independent on selected activities of daily living at baseline were eligible for analyses. A history of substance use disorder was associated with a higher hazard of loss of both physical and mental independence [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.71, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.07-2.78; adjusted HR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.11-2.52, respectively]. After adjusting for substance use disorder and other covariates, older age at diagnosis and female gender were associated with higher hazards of loss of both physical and mental independence, non-white participants had higher hazards of loss of physical independence, whereas participants with an abnormal neurocognitive diagnosis and fewer years of education had higher hazards of loss of mental independence. In summary, history of substance use disorder was associated with loss of measures of both physical and mental independence. The nature of this link and the means to prevent such loss of independence need further investigation."

We analyzed data collected from a sample of OHARNG enlisted between June 2008 and February 2009. Participants completed interviews assessing HIV risk activities defined by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and were screened for PTSD and MDD based on DSM-IV criteria according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Logistic regression was used to examine the independent and combined effects of PTSD and MDD on past-year HIV risk behavior. Of 2,259 participants, 142 (6.3%) reported at least 1 past-year HIV risk behavior. In adjusted models, relative to soldiers with neither disorder, screening positive for MDD only was associated with HIV risk behavior (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.33, 95% CI = [1.15, 4.71]), whereas PTSD was not significant (AOR = 1.60, 95% CI = [0.80, 3.20]). Participants with both PTSD and depression were most likely to report HIV risk behavior (AOR = 2.75, 95% CI = [1.06, 7.11]). Soldiers with PTSD and MDD may be at greater risk for HIV infection due to increased engagement in HIV risk behavior. Integrated interventions to address mental health problems and reduce HIV risk behavior are in need of development and evaluation."

HIV and HCV prevalence, predictors, co-infection rates, and viral subtypes were studied in 592 attendants at an anonymous HIV Counseling and Testing Center in central Brazil. Anti-HIV-1 and -HCV antibodies were screened by ELISA, and Western blots were used to confirm HIV infection. Among HIV-seropositive samples, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nested-PCR were used to subtype HIV-1 by the Heteroduplex Mobility Analysis (HMA) and HCV by the line probe assay (INNO-LiPA). HIV and HCV seroprevalence was 3.2% (95% CI 2.0-4.9) and 2.5% (95% CI 1.5-4.0), respectively. Intravenous drug use was the risk factor most strongly associated with both HIV and HCV infections, even in a population with few intravenous drug users (n = 6); incarceration was also associated with HCV. HIV/AIDS-positive sexual partner and homosexual/bisexual behaviors were associated independently with HIV-1. The prevalence of HCV infection among HIV-positive persons was 42% (95% CI 20-66), higher than in HIV-negative persons (1.2%; 95% CI 0.5-2.5). HIV-1 subtype B was identified in the env and gag regions of the genome. HCV subtype 3a predominated among co-infected persons and one HCV subtype 1a was detected. Overall, a similar prevalence of HIV and HCV infections and a higher prevalence of HCV among HIV-positive persons were observed. Integrated HIV and HCV screening at HIV testing sites may represent a unique opportunity to provide diagnosis and prevention strategies at a single visit."

We tested 8131 archived HIV-infected patient serum samples for P. marneffei-specific mannoprotein (Mp1p) antigen using a highly sensitive and specific ELISA that we previously established. The CD4 count of 2686 cases was determined by flow cytometry. Logistic regression was used to assess predictors of Mp1p antigenaemia. The overall prevalence of disseminated penicilliosis as detected by positive serum Mp1p antigen was 9.36% (761/8131), in good concordance with Platelia™ Aspergillus immunoassay. During 2004-11, the prevalence increased to a peak of 12.58% (158/1256) in 2010 and decreased in 2011. Penicilliosis was strongly associated with progression from HIV to AIDS (OR 4.66, 95% CI 3.94-5.51, p <0.001) and humidity (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, p 0.002).

For 2686 cases with known CD4 count, logistic regression showed that CD4 count of <200 cells/μL was a risk factor for penicilliosis (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.10-7.66, p 0.032), especially when it was <50 cells/μL (OR 24.26, 95% CI 10.63-55.36, p <0.001) during which 28.06% of patients developed disseminated penicilliosis. In conclusion, approximately 9.36% of the HIV-infected patients in our study developed disseminated penicilliosis. Rapid diagnosis may be achieved by performing serological surveillance for Mp1p antigenaemia as a routine procedure for all HIV-infected patients with CD4 count of <50 cells/μL."

The 435 patients (40.2%), who experienced at least one episode of confirmed pancreatic laboratory abnormality had a longer duration of seropositivity, exposure to protease inhibitors, a more frequent immunodeficiency, AIDS, chronic liver and/or biliary disease and hypertriglyceridaemia, while no relation was found with antiretroviral administration, and the duration of type of nucleoside analogues, when compared with the 646 controls. High and prolonged laboratory alterations eventually associated with signs of organ involvement occurred in 166 cases (38.2%), and were related to the administration of didanosine, stavudine, lamivudine, pentamidine, cotrimoxazole or antitubercular/antimycobacterial therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, illicit substance or alcohol abuse, opportunistic infections, chronic liver and/or biliary disease, a protease inhibitor-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and hypertriglyceridaemia (usually associated with HAART administration). No difference was noticed between the 46 patients with clinical and/or imaging evidence of pancreatic involvement and the 120 asymptomatic subjects. Although recurrences of enzyme alterations involved 69.6% of patients, only in 30.1% of cases did a change of the underlying antiretroviral or antimicrobial therapy become necessary. An acute, uncomplicated pancreatitis occurred in nine of the 46 symptomatic subjects (19.6%). A two to four week gabexate and/or octreotide administration (performed in 79 cases of 166, 47.6%), achieved a significant laboratory, clinical and imaging cure or improvement in 82.3% of cases, with a better success rate of combined (gabexate mesilate plus octreotide) vs. single (gabexate mesilate or ocreotide) therapy. Reduced disease recurrences and a better tolerability of antiretroviral regimens, were also noticed."

Lymphocytes from 215 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV)-infected women and 192 of their infants were analyzed by flow cytometry with an extended three-color panel of monoclonal antibodies. Women who did not transmit to their infants tended to have higher CD4+ T cells. Most notably, levels of total CD8+ T cells and CD8+ CD38+ cells made significant independent contributions to predicting the risk of mother-to-child transmission. Adjusting for HIV-1 RNA level at entry, a one percentage-point increase in these marker combinations was associated with a nine percent increase in the likelihood of maternal transmission. Total as well as naive CD4+ T cells were significantly higher in uninfected than infected infants. Total CD8+ cells, as well as CD8+ cells positive for HLA-DR+, CD45 RA+ HLA-DR+, and CD28+ HLA-DR+ were elevated in infected infants. Detailed immunophenotyping may be helpful in predicting which pregnant HIV-infected women are at increased risk of transmitting HIV to their infants. Increasing differences in lymphocyte subsets between infected and uninfected infants became apparent as early as six weeks of age. Detailed immunophenotyping may be useful in supporting the diagnosis of HIV infection in infants with perinatal HIV exposure."

AGAS assesses the ease and ability of participants to take antiretroviral therapy according to a health care provider's recommendations. Data were analyzed from completed baseline assessments of the two studies. The AGAS was internally consistent in both samples. Content, construct, and criterion validity were established using factor analysis and correlations of total AGAS scores with two measures of adherence: electronic drug monitoring and an Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group adherence scale. Viral load, CD4 cell counts, and depression scores were also examined. Reliability and validity of the AGAS were supported in both samples."

A population-based case-control study was conducted and 2,011 liver cancer cases and 7,933 healthy controls were enrolled in Jiangsu, China from 2003 to 2010. Epidemiological data were collected, and serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV antibody were measured. Unconditional logistic regression was used to examine association and potential interaction, while semi-Bayes (SB) method was employed to make estimates more conservative. The prevalence of serum HBsAg positivity was 43.2% among cases and 6.5% among controls. The adjusted odds ratios (OR) for ever smoking were 1.62 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33-1.96) among male and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.53-1.26) among female. Age at first cigarette, duration of smoking and pack-years of smoking were all significantly associated with liver cancer among men. Compared to HBsAg-negative never smokers, the adjusted ORs were 1.25 (95% CI: 1.03-1.52) for HBsAg-negative ever smokers, 7.66 (95% CI: 6.05-9.71) for HBsAg-positive never smokers, and 15.68 (95% CI: 12.06-20.39) for HBsAg-positive ever smokers. These different odds ratios indicated super-additive (RERI: 7.77, 95% CI: 3.81-11.73) and super-multiplicative interactions (ROR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.17-2.30) between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and tobacco smoking. Most associations and interactions detected remained statistically significant after SB adjustments. Tobacco smoking and HBV infection positively interact in the development of liver cancer."
4695,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"In China, HIV-1-infected patients typically receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) that includes lamivudine (3TC) as a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) (ART-3TC). Previous studies from certain developed countries have shown that, in ART-3TC, 3TC-resistant HBV progressively emerges at an annual rate of 15-20% in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV. This scenario in China warrants investigation because >10% of all HIV-infected patients in China are HBV carriers. We measured the occurrence of 3TC-resistant HBV during ART-3TC for HIV-HBV coinfection and also tested the effect of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) used as an additional RTI (ART-3TC/TDF) in a cohort study in China. We obtained 200 plasma samples collected from 50 Chinese patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV (positive for hepatitis B surface antigen) and examined them for the prevalence of 3TC-resistant HBV by directly sequencing PCR products that covered the HBV reverse-transcriptase gene. We divided the patients into ART-3TC and ART-3TC/TDF groups and compared the efficacy of treatment and incidence of drug-resistance mutation between the groups. HIV RNA and HBV DNA loads drastically decreased in both ART-3TC and ART-3TC/TDF groups. In the ART-3TC group, HBV breakthrough or insufficient suppression of HBV DNA loads was observed in 20% (10/50) of the patients after 96-week treatment, and 8 of these patients harbored 3TC-resistant mutants. By contrast, neither HBV breakthrough nor treatment failure was recorded in the ART-3TC/TDF group. All of the 3TC-resistant HBV mutants emerged from the cases in which HBV DNA loads were high at baseline. Our results clearly demonstrated that ART-3TC is associated with the emergence of 3TC-resistant HBV in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and that ART-3TC/TDF reduces HBV DNA loads to an undetectable level. These findings support the use of TDF-based treatment regimens for patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV. "

Nevertheless, HIV positive men are reluctant to attend support groups, and in most mixed gender support groups, women outnumber men. The study used a sample men accessing antiretroviral treatment (ART) from a HIV clinic in South Africa, to examine their perceptions of support groups and explore their reasons for nonparticipation in such groups. Five focus groups interviews were conducted with 50 HIV positive men. Their age ranged from 28-70 years, all had disclosed their HIV status to partners and family members and were receiving ART for more than a year. The main barriers for nonparticipation related to issues on support groups were; Unavailability of support groups in local communities which translated to, no access, the timing of meetings and lack of transport money. Fear of unintended disclosure of HIV status due to breach of confidentiality with resulting stigma and social rejection. On a personal level, participants felt that they had adequate support at home. Participants would consider participating if men only support groups are initiated, support groups are held on weekends, and they are provided with more information on support groups. Health care providers have a critical role to play in creating awareness of and education on the role of support groups for PLWHA. Support group planners should consider men only support groups which has been shown to have positive outcomes and facilitates member participation."

Personal interviews, using a structured questionnaire, were conducted with all HCPs (N=43) working with the ART program at 7 PHC clinics. Insufficient training was expressed as a major concern. Medication adherence was believed to be the most important aspect of care to discuss with HIV-infected patients. HCPs perceived that patients had few side effects.

This practice transformed HIV from a fatal disease to a more manageable chronic condition. However, relatively few studies focus on the experiences of survivors. This study provided a unique opportunity to interview patients who survived at least 10 years after being treated with ART at GHESKIO. The goal of the study was to elicit from patients their perspectives on what enabled them to survive with AIDS. Grounded Theory, a qualitative research method was used to guide data collection, coding, and analysis. Individual interviews were conducted, audio-taped, transcribed and analyzed in Creole, and translated into English. Data saturation was reached at 25 participants. Of which, 64% were women, the mean age was 49, range of 43-55 years, 24% were married, 44% had not completed elementary school, and 72% had no income, the remaining participants had incomes ranging from $1000 to $5000 annually. Qualitative analysis resulted in 681 codes, which were grouped into six categories: being spiritually grounded, having supportive interactions with providers, caring for children, setting personal goals, persevering and living life as usual, and maintaining strict medication adherence practices. The overarching theory was that having a reason to live despite one's circumstances and living life as usual enabled one to survive. Having a strong spiritual foundation coupled with supportive family and providers motivated participants to live and adhere to their ART. As the number of patients who are living longer with HIV in Haiti increases, results from this study will be important in helping tailor interventions that enhance their overall quality of life."

Although there are available clinical markers for genital tract inflammation, such as urinary leukocyte esterase, none have yet been examined in relation to HIV sexual risk behaviours. We sought to examine the association between urinary leukocyte esterase and sexual practices. Sexually active men living with HIV and receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART, N = 290) provided urine specimens and completed behavioural health assessments. HIV RNA tests and CD4 cell counts were abstracted from medical records. Urine specimens were analysed for leukocyte esterase using a standard point-of-care dipstick test. Thirty-one (10.6%) participants tested positive for leukocyte esterase. Logistic regression models did not indicate differences between men with elevated and un-elevated leukocyte activity on demographic, health, recent sexually transmitted infection symptoms and diagnoses or substance use. However, men with elevated leukocyte activity indicated significantly greater sexual behaviour in the previous three months, including more recent unprotected sexual intercourse. A simple over-the-counter urine test may serve as an indicator of sexual HIV infectiousness to inform further evaluation and treatment of genital tract inflammation, as well as condom use decisions during times of increased genital tract inflammation.

However, information regarding population-scale outcomes from a regional perspective is scarce. We aimed to describe the baseline characteristics and therapeutic outcomes of newly-treated individuals with HIV infection in Latin America. A Retrospective cohort study was undertaken. The primary explanatory variable was combination antiretroviral therapy based on either a protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). The main outcome was defined as the composite of all-cause mortality and the occurrence of an AIDS-defining clinical event or a serious non-AIDS-defining event during the first year of therapy. The secondary outcomes included the time to a change in treatment strategy. All analyses were performed according to the intention to treat principle. A total of 937 treatment-naive patients from four participating countries were included (228 patients with PI therapy and 709 with NNRTI-based treatment). At the time of treatment initiation, the patients had a mean age of 37 (SD: 10) years and a median CD4 + T-cell count of 133 cells/mm(3) (interquartile range: 47.5-216.0). Patients receiving PI-based regimens had a significantly lower CD4 + count, a higher AIDS prevalence at baseline and a shorter time from HIV diagnosis until the initiation of treatment. There was no difference in the hazard ratio for the primary outcome between groups. The only covariates associated with the latter were CD4 + cell count at baseline, study site and age. The estimated hazard ratio for the time to a change in treatment (NNRTI vs PI) was 0.61 (95% CI 0.47-0.80, p < 0.01). This study concluded that patients living with HIV in Latin America present with similar clinical outcomes regardless of the choice of initial therapy. Patients treated with PIs are more likely to require a treatment change during the first year of follow up."

HIV viral load (VL) and HIV drug-resistance (HIVDR) outcomes at month 12 were determined in a prospective cohort study of antiretroviral-naïve HIV patients initiating first-line therapy in Kigali. Treatment response was monitored clinically and by regular CD4 counts and targeted HIV viral load (VL) to confirm drug failure. VL measurements and HIVDR genotyping were performed retrospectively on baseline and month 12 samples. One hundred and fifty-eight participants who completed their month 12 follow-up visit had VL data available at month 12. Most of them (88%) were virologically suppressed (VL≤1000 copies/mL) but 18 had virological failure (11%), which is in the range of WHO-suggested targets for HIVDR prevention. If only CD4 criteria had been used to classify treatment response, 26% of the participants would have been misclassified as treatment failure. Pre-therapy HIVDR was documented in 4 of 109 participants (3.6%) with an HIVDR genotyping results at baseline. Eight of 12 participants (66.7%) with virological failure and HIVDR genotyping results at month 12 were found to harbor mutation(s), mostly NNRTI resistance mutations, whereas 4 patients had no HIVDR mutations. Almost half (44%) of the participants initiated ART at CD4 count ≤200 cell/µl and severe CD4 depletion at baseline (<50 cells/µl) was associated with virological treatment failure (p = 0.008). Although the findings may not be generalizable to all HIV patients in Rwanda, our data suggest that first-line ART regimen changes are currently not warranted. However, the accumulation of acquired HIVDR mutations in some participants underscores the need to reinforce HIVDR prevention strategies, such as increasing the availability and appropriate use of VL testing to monitor ART response, ensuring high quality adherence counseling, and promoting earlier identification of HIV patients and enrollment into HIV care and treatment programs."

Treatment failure, defined as virological failure (virus load, >500 copies/microL) or any clinical or biochemical adverse event with a grade of >or=3 (on the basis of the World Health Organization [WHO] or American Heart Association [AHA] scales), was the primary outcome measurement. Failure rates were more frequent in the group treated with protease inhibitors (P<.01), and there were no significant differences in the rate of treatment failure between the group treated with efavirenz and the group treated with abacavir. Tolerability was better in the groups treated with abacavir or with efavirenz versus those treated with protease inhibitors. Fewer patients who received efavirenz experienced viral rebound. Among all groups, the mean increase in the CD4 cell count was 131 cells/microL (P<.001), with no significant difference between groups.

Although most studies report beneficial effects in terms of behavior modification, a direct assessment of the effectiveness of NEPs in preventing HIV infection has been lacking. A cohort study was conducted to assess the association between risk behaviors and HIV seroprevalence and seroincidence among injection drug users in Montreal, Canada. The association between NEP use and HIV infection was examined in three risk assessment scenarios using intensive covariate adjustment for empirical confounders: a cross-sectional analysis of NEP use at entry as a determinant of seroprevalence, a cohort analysis of NEP use at entry as a predictor of subsequent seroconversion, and a nested case-control analysis of NEP participation during follow-up as a predictor of seroconversion. From September 1988 to January 1995, 1,599 subjects were enrolled with a baseline seroprevalence of 10.7%. The mean follow-up period was 21.7 months. The adjusted odds ratio for HIV seroprevalence in injection drug users reporting recent NEP use was 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.5-3.2). In the cohort study, there were 89 incident cases of HIV infection with a cumulative probability of HIV seroconversion of 33% for NEP users and 13% for nonusers (p < 0.0001). In the nested case-control study, consistent NEP use was associated with HIV seroconversion during follow-up (odds ratio = 10.5, 95% confidence interval 2.7-41.0). Risk elevations for HIV infection associated with NEP attendance were substantial and consistent in all three risk assessment scenarios in our cohort of injection drug users, despite extensive adjustment for confounders. In summary, in Montreal, NEP users appear to have higher seroconversion rates then NEP nonusers."

In 2004, several patients with HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) initiated antiretroviral treatment (ART) at the Central Hospital of Liangshan Prefecture. From 2005 to 2013, the number of patients receiving ART dramatically increased.We conducted a retrospective cohort study to analyze the long-term survival time and associated factors among patients with HIV/AIDS who received ART in Liangshan Prefecture for the first time. Data were collected from the Chinese AIDS Antiretroviral Therapy DATAFax Information System. A life table and the Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportion hazard regression were used to calculate the survival time and its associated factors, respectively.Among 8310 ART-naïve patients with HIV/AIDS who initiated ART, 436 patients died of AIDS-related diseases, and their median time of receiving ART was 15.0 ± 12.3 months, whereas 28.7% of them died within the first 6 months after treatment. The cumulative survival rates of those receiving ART in 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years were 97.1%, 93.4%, 90.6%, 88.8%, and 86.0%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that male patients on ART were at a higher risk of death from AIDS-related diseases (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-2.1) than female patients. Patients infected with HIV through injection drug use (IDU) were at a higher risk of death (AHR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.2) than those infected through heterosexual transmission. Patients with a baseline CD4 cell count <50/mm (AHR = 9.8, 95% CI: 6.0-15.9), 50-199/mm (AHR = 3.3, 95% CI: 2.3-4.6), and 200-349/mm (AHR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2-2.3) were at a higher risk of death than those with a CD4 cell count ≥350/mm.ART prolonged survival time of patients with HIV/AIDS and improved their survival probability. Patients with HIV/AIDS should be consistently followed up and the CD4 T-cell count regularly monitored, and timely and early antiretroviral therapy initiated in order to achieve a better survival rate.

However, its prognostic significance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients remains unknown. The spatial QRS-T angle was derived from the baseline resting 12-lead electrocardiogram of 4,453 HIV-infected patients aged 43.5 ± 9.3 years from the Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) trial. CVD events were identified during a median follow-up of 28.7 months. Quartiles of the spatial QRS-T angle was calculated for men and women separately, and values in the upper quartile were considered as a widened angle (values >74° for women and >93° for men). A multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to examine the association between a widened baseline spatial QRS-T angle and incident CVD events. During 11,965 person-years of follow-up, 152 CVD events occurred at a rate of 1.27 events/100 person-years. The rate of CVD events in those with a widened spatial QRS-T angle was almost double the rate in those with a normal spatial QRS-T angle (rate ratio 1.94, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 2.69; p <0.001). In a model adjusted for study treatment arm, demographics, CVD risk factors, HIV characteristics, inflammatory markers, and other ECG abnormalities, a widened spatial QRS-T angle was associated with a >50% increased risk of CVD events compared to a normal spatial QRS-T angle (hazard ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.17; p = 0.02). No interaction was seen by SMART trial arm (p value for interaction = 0.37) or gender (p value for interaction = 0.84). In conclusion, a widened spatial QRS-T angle was independently predictive of CVD events in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. This highlights the potential role of routine electrocardiography as a simple noninvasive CVD risk-screening tool in HIV-infected patients."

At baseline, HBV sequences were predominately wild-type. Under sequential HBV monotherapies including lamivudine, adefovir and entecavir, a high frequency of rtM204I mutation was detected initially as unique and then coexisting with rtM204V. Both mutations were statistically associated with rtA200V and rtV207I, respectively.

Moreover, the participation of other disease mechanisms, such as proinflammatory activity, in the so-called non-AIDS events is becoming increasingly important. To overcome these issues, therapeutic options have dramatically expanded, which has made the management of HIV-1-infected patients increasingly complex. The intense changes seen raise the question of what will be the future of HIV infection and its treatment. A projection into the future may help to reflect on current limitations, needs and research priorities, to optimize patient care. To debate on this topic a group of 38 experts has initiated The HIV 2020 Project, with the aim of reflecting on the future of HIV infection and identifying the needs that should be the attention of research in different areas.

We assessed whether time to first HCV RNA value below the lower limit of quantification in patients with and without cirrhosis was associated with achievement of SVR12. Data were analysed from GT1-infected patients enrolled in six phase 3 studies of 3D ± RBV. Patients who experienced non-virologic failure were excluded from analysis. HCV RNA was determined using the Roche COBAS TaqMan RT-PCR assay (lower limit of quantification, LLOQ =25 IU/mL). SVR12 was analysed by week of first HCV RNA suppression, defined as HCV RNA <LLOQ. The analysis included a total of 2027 patients. Cumulative proportions of subjects with initial HCV RNA suppression <LLOQ at weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6 were 31%, 81%, 99% and 100%, respectively. SVR12 was achieved by 98%, 97%, 98% and 92% of patients with initial suppression at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6, respectively (P=.42, trend test). Across six phase 3 trials of 3D ± RBV, most patients achieved viral suppression by week 2. Time to viral suppression was not associated with subsequent achievement of SVR12, suggesting that on-treatment virologic monitoring may not be necessary with this regimen."

For this paper, we explore the role of partner-relationship characteristics and health behaviors, in predicting HIV testing among Latina adult women who engaged in risky sexual behaviors (i.e., unprotected vaginal and/or anal sex). Data from a convenience sample of 168 Latina adult women who engaged in risky sexual behavior in the year prior to assessment were analyzed for this paper. Rates and predictors of HIV testing among this sample were assessed after a five-year follow-up. Descriptive and analytical estimates include incidence rates and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) from multilevel models. At five-year follow-up, 63.7% (n = 107) women reported having been tested for HIV, of whom 12.2% (n = 13) were women who never tested before. Main reasons for not having been tested at follow-up included: low risk perception (62.1%) and trusting their partner(s)/being in a monogamous relationship/knowing their partner's HIV status (17.2%). Predictors of HIV testing included: age (AOR: 0.96; 95% CI = 0.92-0.99), provider endorsement of HIV testing (AOR: 4.59; 95% CI = 1.77-11.95), poor quality of their romantic relationships (AOR: 1.12; 95% CI = 1.03-1.26), and knowing the HIV sero-status of sexual partner (AOR: 3.61; 95% CI = 1.46-8.95). This study characterizes a group of Latina women at high risk for HIV infection and their HIV testing behaviors. Our findings underscore the need of increasing access to quality health-care services and HIV behavioral interventions, and to strengthen the adherence to HIV/sexually transmitted disease testing recommendations and guidelines among local health-care providers serving the Latino community in South Florida."
15786,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection is common and affects more than one-third of all HIV infected persons worldwide. Prevalence among risk categories varies according to shared risk factors for transmission, mainly intravenous drug use (IDU) and hemophiliacs. Chronic HCV infection seems to accelerate the course of HIV disease, resulting in a worsened clinical and immunological progression. At the same time, several studies suggest that HIV disease modifies the natural history of HCV infection, leading to a faster course of progression from active hepatitis to cirrhosis, to end stage liver disease and death. HCV infection mimics opportunistic diseases because its natural history is significantly accelerated in HIV patients. Since highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has slowed the progression of HIV disease and decreased the rate of HIV associated mortality, the prognosis of HIV disease has been modified, and the need to treat HCV coinfection become a significant issue. Because of the poor response rate obtained by either interferon alone or interferon thrice weekly plus ribavirin, the combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin will probably become the standard of care, although the clinicians should be aware of the overlapping toxicity of nucleoside analogues and ribavirin. Many selected categories of patients pose particular challenges to physicians treating HCV infection: nonresponders to interferon, cirrhotic patients, and patients infected with both HCV and HBV. Liver transplantation in HIV patients is currently under evaluation, but should become the rescue therapy for HIV patients with end stage liver disease."
100,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common; worldwide, an estimated 10% of HIV-infected persons have chronic hepatitis B. Because the incidence of traditional acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related opportunistic infections has decreased with successful anti-HIV therapy, liver disease has emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. HIV infection negatively impacts all phases of the natural history of hepatitis B leading to increased rates of persistent infection, higher HBV DNA levels, lower rates of hepatitis B e antigen loss, increased cirrhosis and liver-related mortality, and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma at lower CD4+ T cell counts. The management of hepatitis B in HIV infection is complicated by the dual activity of several nucleoside analogs, the more rapid development of lamivudine-resistant HBV in patients who are HIV-positive, and the paucity of studies in this population. Until further research emerges on the optimal treatment for this population, data from HBV monoinfected persons will need to be extrapolated to the HIV-HBV coinfected population. Further research is also needed to determine the mechanism(s) for the increased liver disease progression and optimal treatment goals."

In fact, antiviral drugs are ineffective in these patients in the immune tolerance phase, when they have inadequate levels of host immunity. We postulated that combination therapy of an immune modulator and antiviral drugs may have potential to help these patients. Twenty-five patients with incidentally-detected asymptomatic chronic HBV were immunized with hepatitis B vaccine (10 microg of hepatitis B surface antigen) intramuscularly five times (at 0, 1, 2, 6, and 12 mo) to induce HBV-specific immunity. The patients were also treated with lamivudine (100 mg) daily for 12 mo. The combination therapy was safe for all patients with asymptomatic chronic HBV, and no increases in alanine aminotransferase or liver damage were detected in any patient. Although all of the patients were expressing HBV DNA in their serum before treatment, HBV DNA became undetectable in 16 of 25 patients, and was reduced in 9 of 25 patients at the end of the combination therapy. Combination therapy with the antiviral agent lamivudine and an immune modulator (hepatitis B vaccine) represents a potential therapeutic option for the control of HBV without liver damage in asymptomatic chronic HBV carriers."

This study examined the association of drug equipment sharing with psychosocial constructs of the AIDS Risk Reduction Model, specifically, knowledge and perceptions related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) among injection drug users (IDUs). Active IDUs were recruited between April 2004 and January 2005 from syringe exchange and methadone maintenance treatment programs in Montreal, Canada. A structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire elicited information on drug preparation and injection practices, self-reported hepatitis C testing and infection status, and AIDS Risk Reduction Model constructs. Separate logistic regression models were developed to examine variables in relation to: (1) the sharing of syringes, and (2) the sharing of drug preparation equipment (drug containers, filters, and water). Among the 321 participants, the mean age was 33 years, 70% were male, 80% were single, and 91% self-identified as Caucasian. In the multivariable analyses, psychosocial factors linked to syringe sharing were lower perceived benefits of safer injecting and greater difficulty to inject safely. As with syringe sharing, the sharing of drug preparation equipment was associated with lower perceived benefits of safer injecting but also with low self-efficacy to convince others to inject more safely. Interventions should aim to heighten awareness of the benefits of risk reduction and provide IDUs with the skills necessary to negotiate safer injecting with their peers."

Untreated chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is associated with progressive liver disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related mortality. A number of extrahepatic manifestations are also reported in CHC patients, further adding to the burden of the disease. CHC also impacts patients in terms of lower health-related quality of life, higher levels of fatigue and reduced productivity. Furthermore, the later stages of disease are costly for both healthcare systems and society. Pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN)+ribavirin (RBV), for many years the mainstay of treatment, leads to sustained virological response (SVR) in 40%-70% of patients. However, a substantial number of patients are ineligible for treatment, and many patients fail to achieve SVR with this regimen. Furthermore, PEG-IFN+RBV leads to impairment of patient-reported outcomes during treatment, and most patients suffer from adverse events, associated with poor adherence, treatment discontinuation and treatment failure. The approval of second-generation direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has revolutionized the treatment of CHC patients. All-oral, PEG-IFN and RBV-free regimens have higher efficacy rates, shorter treatment durations, fewer adverse events, higher adherence rates and improvement in PROs from as early as Week 4, compared to PEG-IFN+RBV regimens. The aim of this article is to review the evidence for HCV infection as a systemic disease, summarizing the impact of hepatitis C and its treatments on clinical, patient and economic outcomes, with a focus on data from Asia and Japan specifically."

We analyzed data from the 2006-2007 Pakistan Demographic Health Survey (PDHS) to describe the distribution of injections administered with newly opened syringes and assessed the association of knowledge about bloodborne pathogens with syringe reuse in Pakistan. In the PDHS, women aged 12-49 years were enrolled through a multistage stratified cluster-sampling strategy across Pakistan. Approximately 10,000 women were interviewed to collect information regarding receiving injections, the use of syringes taken out of new unopened packages for their last injections, and knowledge regarding the transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), HBV and HCV through the re-use of syringes and transfusion of unscreened blood. Of the 5126/10,023 women who provided information concerning their last injection, 4342 (86%) received this injection with a new syringe taken out of an unopened package. The proportion of injections received with a new syringe increased with the education level, wealth, HIV knowledge and knowledge about HCV/HBV transmission through the re-use of syringes. In the multivariable model, respondents in the 4th (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.1, 95%CI: 1.4-3.0) and 5th (AOR: 2.4, 95%CI: 1.6-3.5) wealth quintiles, with some education (AOR: 1.4, 95%CI: 1.1-1.9), those in the 4th quartile of the HIV knowledge score (AOR: 1.5, 95%CI: 1.1-2.0), and those with the knowledge that a new syringe protects against HCV/HBV and HIV (AOR: 2.3, 95%CI: 1.5-3.5) were more likely to receive injections with a newly opened syringe. The patients' knowledge regarding the transmission of bloodborne pathogens is an important factor in receiving injections with a new syringe. "

Some studies suggest that antiretroviral drug-resistant viruses might have decreased replication capacity and transmissibility. However, cases of perinatal transmission of multidrug-resistant HIV type-1 (HIV-1) have been described. Here, we report the case of one child with vertically-acquired multidrug-resistant HIV-1 and the outcome of a rescue therapy with a darunavir/ritonavir- and etravirine-containing antiretroviral regimen. During the 15 months of therapy, the child showed clinical improvement, including no side effects, persistent suppression of viral replication and a great increase in CD4+ T-cell count. Paediatric HIV specialists should be prepared to manage a small, but increasing, number of babies with a 'nightmare' multidrug-resistant virus with no available treatment options. The use of experimental agents might become a compelling issue in vertically HIV-infected children born in the era of highly active ART."
10097,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"The synthetic peptide T-20 (enfuvirtide) represents the first of a new class of antiretroviral compounds to demonstrate in vivo potency by targeting a step in viral entry. T-20 inhibits a conformational change in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) that is required for fusion between HIV-1 and target cell membranes. The initial phase I clinical trial of T-20 treatment for HIV-infected patients thus provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the emergence of resistant virus in vivo to this novel class of antiretroviral agents. All four patients who received an intermediate dose of T-20 (30 mg twice daily) had an initial decline in plasma viral load over the first 10 days but a rising trend by day 14, suggestive of selection for resistant virus. Plasma virus derived from patients enrolled in all dosage groups of the phase I T-20 trial was analyzed by population sequencing before and after treatment. While no mutations were found within a highly conserved 3-amino-acid sequence (GIV) known to be critical for fusion at baseline, after 14 days of therapy, virus from one patient in the 30-mg dose group (30-1) developed a mutation in this motif, specifically an aspartic acid (D) substitution for glycine (G) at position 36. Multiple env clones were derived from the plasma virus of all four patients in the 30-mg dosage group. Sequence analysis of 49 clones derived from the plasma of patient 30-1 on day 14 revealed that 25 clones contained the G36D mutation, while 8 contained the V38A mutation. Dual mutations involving G36D and other residues within the HR1 domain were also identified. In 5 of the 49 env clones, other mutations involving residues 32 (Q32R or Q32H) and 39 (Q39R) were found in combination with G36D. Cloned env sequences derived from the plasma virus of subject 30-3 also had single mutations in the GIV sequence (V38M and I37V) detectable following therapy with T-20. The plasma virus from subjects 30-2 and 30-4 did not contain changes within the GIV sequence. To analyze the biological resistance properties of these mutations, we developed a novel single-cycle HIV-1 entry assay using JC53BL cells which express beta-galactosidase and luciferase under control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. Full-length env clones were derived from the plasma virus of patients 30-1 and 30-3 and used to generate pseudotyped virus stocks. The mean 50% inhibition concentrations (IC(50)s) for mutants G36D and V38A (patient 30-1) were 2.3 microg/ml and 11.2 microg/ml, respectively, statistically significant increases of 9.1- and 45-fold, respectively, compared with those of wild-type Env. The IC(50) for the V38 M mutation (patient 30-3) was 7.6 microg/ml, an 8-fold increase compared with that of the wild type. The I37V mutation resulted in an IC(50) 3.2-fold greater than that of the wild type. Envs with double mutations (Q32R plus G36D and Q32H plus G36D) exhibited a level of resistance similar to that of G36D alone. These findings provide the first evidence for the rapid emergence of clinical resistance to a novel class of HIV-1 entry inhibitors and may be relevant to future treatment strategies involving these agents."

To explore barriers to IPT completion in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, we conducted individual semi-structured interviews among 30 HIV patients who had completed or defaulted IPT. Interview transcripts were analyzed according to the framework method of qualitative analysis. Facilitators of IPT completion included knowledge of TB and IPT, accepting one's HIV diagnosis, viewing IPT as similar to antiretroviral therapy, having social support in the community and the clinic, trust in the healthcare system, and desire for health preservation. Barriers included misunderstanding of IPT's preventive role in the absence of symptoms, inefficient health service delivery, ineffective communication with healthcare workers, financial burden of transport to clinic and lost wages, and competing priorities. HIV-related stigma was not identified as a significant barrier to IPT completion, and participants felt confident in their ability to manage stigma, for example by pretending their medications were for unrelated conditions. Completers were more comfortable communicating with health care workers than were defaulters. Efforts to facilitate successful IPT completion must include appropriate counseling and education for individual patients and addressing inefficiencies within the health care system in order to minimize patients' financial and logistical burden. These patient-level and structural changes are necessary for IPT to successfully reduce TB incidence in this resource-limited setting."

Screening for HAD in South Africa involves several challenges, including few culturally appropriate and validated screening tools, and a shortage of trained personnel to conduct screening. This study examined rates of positive HAD screens as determined by the cutoff score on the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) administered by nonspecialist community health workers (CHWs) in South Africa and examined associations between positive HAD screens and common risk factors for HAD. Sixty-five Xhosa-speaking HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with low CD4 counts and documented ART adherence problems were administered a battery of demographic, psychiatric and neurocognitive screening measures. Positive HAD screens were present in 80% of the sample. Presence of a current alcohol dependence disorder and CD4 counts of 200 or lower were significantly associated with positive HAD screens. HIV-positive South Africans on ART with low CD4 counts and ART adherence problems may be at a very high risk for HAD, highlighting the need for more routine screening and monitoring of neurocognitive functions among South Africa's millions of PLWH on ART. Future research is needed to: (1) validate IHDS performance against a gold standard neurocognitive battery for the detection of HAD among larger samples of Xhosa-speaking South Africans with ART adherence difficulties and (2) compare performance of CHW to expert health care personnel in administering the IHDS."
1153,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 are genetically distinct viruses that each can cause AIDS. Approximately 1 million people are infected with both HIV-1 and HIV-2. Additionally, these two viruses use the same receptor and coreceptors and can therefore infect the same target cell populations. To explore potential genetic interactions, we first examined whether RNAs from HIV-1 and HIV-2 can be copackaged into the same virion. We used modified near-full-length viruses that each contained a green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) with a different inactivating mutation. Thus, a functional gfp could be reconstituted via recombination, which was used to detect the copackaging of HIV-1 and HIV-2 RNAs. The GFP-positive (GFP(+)) phenotype was detected in approximately 0.2% of the infection events, which was 35-fold lower than the intrasubtype HIV-1 rates. We isolated and characterized 54 GFP(+) single-cell clones and determined that all of them contained proviruses with reconstituted gfp. We then mapped the general structures of the recombinant viruses and characterized the recombination junctions by DNA sequencing. We observed several different recombination patterns, including those that had crossovers only in gfp. The most common hybrid genomes had heterologous long terminal repeats. Although infrequent, crossovers in the viral sequences were also identified. Taken together, our study demonstrates that HIV-1 and HIV-2 can recombine, albeit at low frequencies. These observations indicate that multiple factors are likely to restrict the generation of viable hybrid HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses. However, considering the large coinfected human population and the high viral load in patients, these rare events could provide the basis for the generation of novel human immunodeficiency viruses."
7010,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is common among Latinos living with HIV in the United States (US)-Mexico border region. Health providers may vary in their approach to communicating acceptance or non acceptance of CAM use, which can undermine patient confidence in disclosing CAM use. Patient-provider communication about CAM is important because certain types of CAM can affect antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. We undertook the present binational study to understand US and Mexican provider beliefs, and perceptions surrounding CAM use among Latino patients, and to learn if and how CAM communication occurs. Between July and December 2010, we conducted in-depth, qualitative interviews in Tijuana and San Diego. Analysis procedures drew upon principles of Grounded Theory. The sample was comprised of 19 HIV-health care providers, including 7 women and 12 men. Emerging CAM-related themes were: Provider's perceptions, attitudes and knowledge about CAM; CAM types and modalities; and patient-provider CAM communication. Many clinicians were uncomfortable supporting CAM use with their patients. San Diego providers reported more frequent instances of CAM use among Latino patients than Tijuana providers. Providers from both cities reported that patients infrequently disclose CAM use and almost half do not routinely ask patients about CAM practices. Most of the providers acknowledged that they lack information about CAM, and are concerned about the drug interaction as well as the effects of CAM on adherence. Our findings have important implications for understanding provider communication surrounding CAM use in a highly transnational population and context. Because CAM use may undermine ART adherence and is highly prevalent among Latinos, provider communication about CAM is critical to improved health outcomes among HIV-positive Latinos. Considering the significant growth of US Latinos, especially in the US-Mexico border region, assessment of Mexican and US provider training and communication needs surrounding Latino patient CAM use is warranted.

11855,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"We assessed the performance of HIV-1 genotyping tests in rescue therapy. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (genotyped), included those switching to new antiretroviral drugs based on HIV-1 genotyping data, and group 2 (standard of care -SOC), comprised those in rescue therapy who had not used this test. This was an open and non-randomized study, with 74 patients, followed up for a mean period of 12 months, from February 2002 to May 2003. The groups differed in the duration of antiretroviral use, experience with diverse drug classes (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors) and viral load <2.6 log10 copies/mL at any time during treatment. In 23 patients (group 1), the switch in antiretroviral (ARV) regimen was based on genotyping data; this test was not used for 51 patients (group 2). Two CD4 + lymphocyte counts and viral load counts were made for each patient during the study. Data from the pharmacy where patients received antiretroviral agents, medical charts, and direct interviews with patients to assess compliance to treatment, were analyzed. In the genotyped group, the average drop in viral load was 2.8 log10, compared with a 1.5 log10 difference in group 2; the difference was significant in the first assessment performed six months after switching (p=0.001). Considering the patients with viral load < 2.6 log10 (400 copies/mL) after switching, the patients in group 1 had a better performance in the first assessment (73.9% versus 31.1% in groups 1 and 2, respectively); this difference was significant (p=0.001). In multivariate analysis, the variables associated with a greater drop in viral load in the first assessment were the patients whose switching was based on genotyping (group 1), those with a past history of viral load < 2.6 log10 and correct use of antiretroviral agents. In conclusion, the genotyping test and adherence were found to be independent factors for success in the management of patients who failed treatment."

HCV RNA was measured by the 2.0 bDNA assay and an 'in-house' polymerase chain reaction assay. Antibody reactivity patterns were examined using a recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA). Prior HCV infection was found in two (8%) of 25 antiHCV negative patients. HCV viraemia persisted in all 26 antiHCV+ patients who were coinfected with HIV. HCV RNA clearance was found in 12 (25%) of 49 antiHCV+, HIV- patients. Viral clearance was associated with younger current age (P < 0.01) and age at infection (P < 0.001), but not with duration of infection or with dose or frequency of clotting factor use. RIBA ratios reflecting an index of each patient's overall reactivity to four HCV epitopes were significantly lower in those with viral clearance (P < 0.0001). Over a period of 15 years, those with viral clearance demonstrated significant loss of reactivity to the NS3, NS4 and NS5 epitopes, while those with viral persistence demonstrated relatively stable reactivities to all epitopes. We conclude that spontaneous HCV RNA clearance in haemophiliacs is age-related and is unlikely to occur in those coinfected with HIV. The loss of antibody reactivity for some epitopes, especially c22 (core), may be a marker for the natural resolution of chronic HCV infection."
9124,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Since 1984 reports of renal involvement in AIDS patients have been presented in the literature. Different forms of renal disease were noted in the AIDS population including those related to systemic and local renal infections, tubulointerstitial disease, renal involvement by neoplasm and glomerular disease including collapsing glomerulopathy (CG). HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) has been demonstrated to be more severe in the black population. HIVAN is the most common cause of renal failure in HIV-1-seropositive patients. The term HIVAN is reserved for the typical histopathological form of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) characterized by the findings of coexistent glomerular and severe tubulointerstitial disease. In both humans and the murine model, glomerular lesions include FSGS, glomerular collapse and podocyte hyperplasia. The tubulointerstitial damage as well as the glomerular collapse can also be seen in non-HIV primary collapsing GN, raising the question of common mechanisms to HIV and other non-identified viral agents related to the development of the disease. Although controversial, increasing evidence supports a direct effect of the virus on renal cells either as a result of exposure to viral proteins or direct renal parenchyma infection. The use of a HIV-1 transgenic mouse model has demonstrated a direct etiologic link between HIV-1 expression in kidney and the development of HIVAN with unique viral-host interactions, which depend at the same time on stimulating features of the virus and the individual nature of the host response. The infection of renal cells by HIV-1 could be detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of gag RNA at a low level. Some studies using an HIV-1 transgenic mouse model have demonstrated that expression of HIV- 1 in the kidney is required for the development of HIVAN. The final common pathway in the development of HIV-associated nephropathy is likely to involve alterations in the patterns of gene expression of renal parenchyma cells by cytokines and growth factors, leading to interstitial fibrosis and enhanced glomerular matrix synthesis. The nature of the host response to viral infection is critical to the development of nephropathy.HLA-linked responses particular to a subset of blacks may explain some of the epidemiologic features of HIVAN. There may also be biological heterogeneity in the strains of HIV-1 that could account for a particular renotropic strain. HIV strains from different parts of the world may vary by as much as 15% at the level of nucleotide sequence. The infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in human glomerular cells has been evaluated by exposing homogeneous cultures of human glomerular capillary endothelial, mesangial and epithelial cells to HIV in vitro. The mechanism of access of HIV into glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells is unknown up to now; HIV is generally infectious for cells expressing the CD4 antigen in their cell membrane. Other modes of HIV entry into cells independent of the CD4 receptor are possible through mechanisms involving Fc-receptors or coinfection with other enveloped viruses such as HTLV-l. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of HIVAN has been aided by the development of a transgenic model. The curious fact that only 3 of 8 founded transgenic lines developed nephropathy emphasizes that the expression of viral gene products per se is not sufficient to produce nephropathy. Human renal epithelium does not express CD4 receptors and in vitro attempts to infect glomerular epithelial cells using laboratory strains of HIV-1 have proven fruitless. The striking morphologic and phenotypic similarities between HIVAN and collapsing idiopathic FSGS raise the question whether the altered podocyte gene expression in collapsing idiopathic FSGS may also be due to a viral infection. This hypothesis is further supported by de novo occurrence of collapsing idiopathic FSGS in immunosuppressed renal transplantation patients and by epidemiologic data. In conclusion, there are likely to be common mechanisms in the pathogenesis for collapsing idiopathic glomerulosclerosis and HIVAN. A primary injury of the podocyte leading to dysregulation of the cellular phenotype appears to mediate the glomerular tuft collapse in both conditions. Primary collapsing glomerulopathy recurs post-transplantation, raising the possibility of circulating factors implicated in the pathogenesis of visceral epithelial cell damage in steroid-resistant minimal change disease or recurrent FSGS. Recurrence of CG can occur hours after transplantation, suggesting that the plasma of CG patients contains one or more factors capable of inducing proteinuria due to the damage of the podocyte that results in the increase in glomerular permeability. In a rat model of CG developed by our group, the injection of serum from CG patients resulted in proteinuria, glomerular tuft retraction and podocyte damage at the ultrastructural level (visceral epithelial cell foot-process effacement). No ultrastructural or light microscopy abnormalities were seen in rats injected with serum from non-collapsing FSGS or healthy subjects. Based on the experience of our group, circulating factors play a dominant role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic CG."

A literature search revealed an additional 50 reported cases of HIV-related BCBL, as well as reports of several other disorders associated with HHV-8 DNA. Comprehensive analysis of the clinical and pathobiological features of all 58 known cases of HIV-related BCBL shows it to be a unique B-cell neoplasm with a strong propensity for body-cavity involvement without mass lesions and with little or no dissemination, poor prognosis, high grade usually immunoblastic morphology, late B-cell phenotype and genotype, no associated c-myc gene rearrangement, frequent presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome, and uniform association with HHV-8 DNA. Considering these features in the context of other disorders associated with HHV-8 DNA, HHV-8 appears to play a causal role in BCBL, possibly in concert with EBV, and may induce this lymphoma through dysregulation of cytokines, particularly interleukin-6, or infection of an unusual B-cell subset. The characteristics of HHV-8-associated BCBL suggest a possible role for antiherpes or anticytokine agents in the treatment of this lymphoma."

Our objective was to study the effect of HAART on both B cell repopulation and hypergammaglobulinemia in 72 naïve patients, including 35 HCV-coinfected individuals, during 156 weeks on HAART. The possible role of HCV coinfection on the recovery of the humoral immune system was also investigated. At baseline, HCV-coinfected patients had greater circulant IgG levels than HIV-only-infected patients, while B cell count and CD21(low) B cell subpopulation were similar in both groups. During HAART, HIV-only-infected patients reached normal B cell counts and circulant IgG levels, while HCV-coinfected individuals did not. CD21(low) B cell subpopulation significantly decreased in both groups of patients at week 48 after the initiation of HAART compared to baseline. Thus, B cells remained continuously stimulated in HCV-coinfected patients and this stimulation seemed to be through a CD21-independent pathway."

This study sought to evaluate the effect of these polymorphisms on anemia, hemoglobin reduction, HCV kinetics, and treatment outcomes. Sixty-three patients coinfected with HIV and HCV and 58 patients infected with HCV only were treated with pegIFN/RBV were genotyped using the ABI TaqMan allelic discrimination kit for the 2 ITPA SNP variants rs1127354 and rs7270101. A composite variable of ITPA deficiency using both SNPs was created as previously reported. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney test or Chi square/Fishers exact test for categorical data and mixed model analysis for multiple variables. Thirty-five patients (30%) were predicted to have reduced ITPA activity. ITPA deficiency was found to be protective against the development of hemoglobin reduction >3 g/dl over the course of treatment. The rates of hemoglobin reduction >3 g/dl decreased in correlation with the severity of ITPA deficiency. ITPA deficiency was associated with slower hemoglobin decline early in treatment (week 4, P = 0.020) and rapid virologic response (RVR) at week 4 (P = 0.017) in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV. ITPA polymorphisms are associated with hemoglobin decline and in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV it is also associated with early virologic outcomes. Determination of ITPA polymorphisms may allow prediction of RBV-induced anemia and earlier initiation of supportive care to ensure optimal therapeutic outcomes."

HIV / HCV patients with a mean CD4 count of 502 were treated for 24-48 weeks depending on genotype. Virological response was assessed at weeks 4 (RVR), 12 [early virological response (EVR)], 24, at end of treatment (EOTR) and 24 weeks post-completion of treatment (SVR). Primary end-point was defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment completion. Fifty-five per cent of co-infected patients were on highly active anti-retroviral therapy. A majority of patient group were male. 60% of HIV / HCV patients achieved SVR (35% genotype 1 / 4; 77% genotype 2 / 3). 24 HIV / HCV patients achieved undetectable HCV levels compared with baseline by week 4. The positive predictive value (PPV) of RVR at week 4 for subsequent SVR in HIV-HCV co-infected patients was 100%; the negative predictive value (NPV) was 57%. Significant variables associated with SVR were: (i) lower median pre-treatment HCV viral load, (ii) genotype 2 / 3 disease and (iii) achievement of RVR. Independent variables associated with RVR were low pre-treatment HCV viral load and genotype 2 / 3 disease. Achievement of RVR, a negative HCV-PCR, at week 4 of treatment is predictive of SVR in this cohort of patients. This may be used to guide optimal treatment duration in patient groups. More significantly, the data serve to highlight the subgroup of patients who, on achieving RVR, should be actively supported to complete HCV treatment with full dose therapy, especially patients co-infected with G2 / 3 disease for whom 6 months' full dose therapy may be sufficient to obtain a SVR."

The frequency and phenotype of circulating T(regs) (defined as CD3(+) CD4(+) CD25(high) or CD3(+) CD4(+) FOXP3(+)) and NK cells (CD3(-) CD16(+)/CD56(+)) were evaluated at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. The expression of CD25, CTLA-4, and granzymes A and B by CD4(+) FOXP3(+) cells, as well as the expression of KIR receptors (NKB1, CD158a, and NKAT2) on NK cells, was evaluated. Low doses of IL-2 resulted in the augmented frequency and absolute number of T(regs) in coinfected individuals. FOXP3 levels per cell as well as augmented CD25 and CTLA-4 expression by T(regs) suggested that IL-2 may lead to both expansion and activation of T(regs), although changes in the proportion of CD4(+) FOXP3(+) cells were not associated with changes in HCV viral load and CD4(+) cells between baseline and week 12. NK cell frequency also increased after IL-2 therapy. Interestingly, the pattern of expression of KIR receptors was changed by IL-2 treatment, since the frequency of NK cells expressing NKB1 augmented whereas the frequency of NK expressing CD158a and NKAT2 decreased."

However, the mortality of central nervous system (CNS) complications and opportunistic infections is still high in untreated HIV-infected individuals or in patients unaware of their HIV infection. We describe the outcome of HIV-infected patients followed at a single center for AIDS-related neurological syndromes in the 16 years following the introduction of HAART, and compare the findings with those in patients admitted up to 1996. We have conducted a retrospective study of patients with HIV infection or AIDS (based on WHO criteria and classified according to the 1993 CDC criteria) admitted during 20 years (January 1992 to March 2012) to the Infectious Diseases Unit of the University of Verona for the presence of focal or widespread CNS lesion on neuroimaging. Clinical history, CD4 cell count, HIV-RNA level, neurological examination, imaging, cerebrospinal fluid examination and eventual cerebral biopsy results were reviewed as well as the final neurological diagnosis and the treatment. The survival time from the clinical onset of the neurologic syndrome to death was calculated for each patient who died. A statistical analysis was performed comparing data collected up to and after 1996, i.e., before and after HAART introduction. Among 1043 patients with HIV infection or AIDS admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of the University of Verona between January 1992 and March 2012, 114 had a CNS lesion. The following diseases were observed: neurotoxoplasmosis (NT), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), the severe form of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, cryptococcal encephalitis (CE) and lesions of undetermined origin. The follow-up period was 4 weeks to 72 months both in the pre-HAART and HAART era. Cerebral lesions were detected in 53/243 patients (21.8%) in the pre-HAART era and in 61/801 patients (7.6%) in the HAART era (p < 0.001). Most patients who developed a neurological complication in the HAART period (40/59, 67.8%) were untreated or did not know to be HIV-infected; in particular, 27.9% of patients with a CNS lesion in the HAART era were unaware of their HIV infection vs 13.2% in the pre-HAART era (p < 0.05). Some patients were not virologically suppressed (14/59, 23.7%) or were immunological non-responders (undetectable viral load, with CD4 count <200 cells/μL; 4/59, 6.8%). Other statistically significant data were the mean age at the onset of neurological complications (32.6 ± 5.4 years in the pre-HAART, 40.3 ± 9.5 in the HAART group, p < 0.001) and the mean CD4 cell count at the onset of illness (median of 38 cells/µL (2-215) in the pre-HAART, 77 cells/µL (2-752) in the HAART group; p < 0.001). In the HAART era a reduction of PCNSL and NT was observed. Our results, while confirming a decrease in the incidence of opportunistic infections of the CNS in the HAART era, show that late presentation of patients with HIV infection remains an important issue in our catchment area."
15771,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"This report updates and combines into one document earlier versions of guidelines for preventing and treating opportunistic infections (OIs) among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children, last published in 2002 and 2004, respectively. These guidelines are intended for use by clinicians and other health-care workers providing medical care for HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children in the United States. The guidelines discuss opportunistic pathogens that occur in the United States and one that might be acquired during international travel (i.e., malaria). Topic areas covered for each OI include a brief description of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of the OI in children; prevention of exposure; prevention of disease by chemoprophylaxis and/or vaccination; discontinuation of primary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution; treatment of disease; monitoring for adverse effects during treatment; management of treatment failure; prevention of disease recurrence; and discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution. A separate document about preventing and treating of OIs among HIV-infected adults and postpubertal adolescents (Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents) was prepared by a working group of adult HIV and infectious disease specialists. The guidelines were developed by a panel of specialists in pediatric HIV infection and infectious diseases (the Pediatric Opportunistic Infections Working Group) from the U.S. government and academic institutions. For each OI, a pediatric specialist with content-matter expertise reviewed the literature for new information since the last guidelines were published; they then proposed revised recommendations at a meeting at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in June 2007. After these presentations and discussions, the guidelines underwent further revision, with review and approval by the Working Group, and final endorsement by NIH, CDC, the HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society (PIDS), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The recommendations are rated by a letter that indicates the strength of the recommendation and a Roman numeral that indicates the quality of the evidence supporting the recommendation so readers can ascertain how best to apply the recommendations in their practice environments. An important mode of acquisition of OIs, as well as HIV infection among children, is from their infected mother; HIV-infected women coinfected with opportunistic pathogens might be more likely than women without HIV infection to transmit these infections to their infants. In addition, HIV-infected women or HIV-infected family members coinfected with certain opportunistic pathogens might be more likely to transmit these infections horizontally to their children, resulting in increased likelihood of primary acquisition of such infections in the young child. Therefore, infections with opportunistic pathogens might affect not just HIV-infected infants but also HIV-exposed but uninfected infants who become infected by the pathogen because of transmission from HIV-infected mothers or family members with coinfections. These guidelines for treating OIs in children therefore consider treatment of infections among all children, both HIV-infected and uninfected, born to HIV-infected women. Additionally, HIV infection is increasingly seen among adolescents with perinatal infection now surviving into their teens and among youth with behaviorally acquired HIV infection. Although guidelines for postpubertal adolescents can be found in the adult OI guidelines, drug pharmacokinetics and response to treatment may differ for younger prepubertal or pubertal adolescents. Therefore, these guidelines also apply to treatment of HIV-infected youth who have not yet completed pubertal development. Major changes in the guidelines include 1) greater emphasis on the importance of antiretroviral therapy for preventing and treating OIs, especially those OIs for which no specific therapy exists; 2) information about the diagnosis and management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes; 3) information about managing antiretroviral therapy in children with OIs, including potential drug--drug interactions; 4) new guidance on diagnosing of HIV infection and presumptively excluding HIV infection in infants that affect the need for initiation of prophylaxis to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in neonates; 5) updated immunization recommendations for HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children, including hepatitis A, human papillomavirus, meningococcal, and rotavirus vaccines; 6) addition of sections on aspergillosis; bartonella; human herpes virus-6, -7, and -8; malaria; and progressive multifocal leukodystrophy (PML); and 7) new recommendations on discontinuation of OI prophylaxis after immune reconstitution in children. The report includes six tables pertinent to preventing and treating OIs in children and two figures describing immunization recommendations for children aged 0--6 years and 7--18 years. Because treatment of OIs is an evolving science, and availability of new agents or clinical data on existing agents might change therapeutic options and preferences, these recommendations will be periodically updated and will be available at http://AIDSInfo.nih.gov."

CD4 lymphocyte count, HIV-1 viral load, clinical status, were assessed every month during STI and after ART reintroduction. Genotype analysis by plasma virus sequencing was done before and after treatment interruption. The results of 14 patients who resumed ART for at least two months are presented. Median duration of STI was 7.5 months (range: 2-13 months). Median CD4 count was low (45/mm3) when treatment was stopped, and decreased during STI (-37/mm3 after six months). Several patients exhibited important CD4 diminutions. Viral load slightly increased (+0.83 log at M6). Few clinical events occurred: one: severe HIV-related prurigo and one CMV viremia. Reversion of resistance mutations was only seen in 2/13 (15: 4%) patients (who had previously a major CD4 deficiency, and a long treatment history), a partial reversion occurred in 5/13 (38.5%) subjects, and the mutations didn't change in the other cases (genotyping non interpretable in the last patient). ART reintroduction induced a good immune response:  CD4/mm3 after six months, with significant increases in 10/14 subjects. There was an initial viral response (median viral load: -2.34 log at M1), but a quick rebound most often occurred. However, viral load remained < 50 copies/mL in four patients. In conclusion, a rapid and important decline in CD4 cell count can occur when treatment is discontinued, in patients with virological failure of ART, but the clinical risk appears to be limited. Treatment re-initiation induces a good response, but virologically transient in most cases. Patients with a shift to wild-type virus seem to have a better response."

Differences in host genetics are believed to affect the outcome of HCV infection. We analysed an exonic, a promoter and an intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the interferon-λ3 coding interleukin (IL)-28B gene to study the relationship between IL28B SNPs and outcome of HCV infection. Among 206 HIV-1-infected Europeans with evidence of HCV infection, 47 (23%) individuals had cleared HCV and 159 (77%) had developed chronic infection. The exonic rs8103142 CT, the promoter rs12979860 CT and the intronic rs11881222 AG genotypes were associated with a decreased HCV clearance rate with adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of 0.3 (95% CI, 0.1-0.7), 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.8) and 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.8), respectively. The haplotype block TCG CTA was associated with a decreased HCV clearance rate (aOR 0.4, 95% CI, 0.2-0.8). Further, we found significant differences in HCV RNA levels among individuals chronically infected with HCV genotype 1 for rs8103142 and rs12979860 (P ≤ 0.05). Chronically infected individuals with HCV genotype 3 and with the favourable haplotype block CTA CTA had higher median HCV RNA levels than individuals with unfavourable haplotype blocks (P ≤ 0.05). Our findings suggest that IL28B may account for some differences in HCV outcome but that other factors including the viral genotype, host genetics and the host-virus interaction are likely to influence the outcome of HCV infection."
13089,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"The recent elucidation of the life cycle and dynamics of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and technological advances in development of the HIV RNA PCR assay for sensitive detection of viral load have revolutionized the diagnosis, management, and treatment of HIV infection. Beginning with initial infection, there is unremitting, high-level viral replication that persists throughout the course of HIV infection. The measure of the amount of virus present in plasma, HIV viral load, is the single most important predictor of HIV progression, the best indicator of immune system decline, and the best guide for initiating and monitoring antiviral treatment. Further, HIV viral load has become the new yardstick against which other markers, including CD4 number, age, chemokine receptor mutations, cytotoxic T-cell responses, and neutralizing antibody titers are assessed. For individuals with haemophilia, additional 'markers' may have significant impact on the outcome of HIV disease. Chronic factor concentrate treatment has led to transfusion-associated hepatitis, co-infection with hepatitis C (HCV), and chronic liver disease. The latter may become accelerated with HIV progression and may lead to hepatotoxicity with antiviral drug therapy. Chronic factor concentrate treatment has also been associated with immunosuppression, including both B- and T-cell immune defects. In HIV(+) haemophilic men, this immune deficit has led to lower CD4 counts with HIV progression and poorer CD4 response to antiviral drugs than in gay men. The underlying haemophilic bleeding tendency may result in significant haemorrhage with HIV-associated immune thrombocytopenia and with protease inhibitor antiretroviral therapy. Although AIDS is the leading cause of death in this group, the reduction in the size of the haemophilia population over the next two centuries is estimated to be small, and survival should improve as better antiviral therapeutics are identified."
1300,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"As human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients now live longer while receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), chronic kidney disease (CKD) has emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among urban HIV population. Risk factors associated with CKD in such HIV-infected population include aging, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, co-infection with hepatitis C virus, low CD4 cell count, and high HIV viral load. Clinical experience has shown that HIV-infected individuals often have one or more concurrent risk factors for CKD. The cumulative effect of multiple risk factors on the development of CKD should be noted in this population. Glomerular disease directly related to HIV infection, so-called HIV-associated nephropathy, remains an important cause of CKD among limited HIV population of African descent. The impact of exposure to nephrotoxic antiretroviral agents on the development of kidney disease is both an old and a new concern. In particular, the association of tenofovir with kidney disease has been an area of great interest. The findings regarding tenofovir's adverse effect on long-term kidney function vary among studies. Early identification and treatment of kidney disease is imperative for reducing the burden of patients requiring dialysis in HIV-infected populations. Periodic monitoring of urinary albumin excretion, tubular parameters such as low-molecular-weight proteinuria, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate may be useful for early diagnosis of patients at risk for incident CKD. This review focuses on recent developments in epidemiology, risk factors, identification, estimation, and management of CKD in HIV-infected population in the HAART era."

Deaths related to HCV now exceed deaths related to HIV in the United States, and co-infected patients bear a significant proportion of that mortality. This burden may be addressed by novel antiviral therapies that promise increased rates of cure or by enhanced access to liver transplantation, but these are costly interventions. Ultimately, the future burden of coinfection is addressed by greater understanding of who is at risk for development of each infection, thus guiding preventive efforts. Key recent reports regarding the US burden of morbidity and mortality due to HCV and groups at risk for coinfection are reviewed, with a focus on recently described HCV occurring among young injection drug users and men who have sex with men. Given the lack of available vaccine against HCV, enhanced detection and surveillance is a vital component of our public health strategy to combat HCV."

This study evaluated the level of exposure to different risk factors associated with HCV transmission and characterized the distribution of HCV genotypes in 356 HIV-1-positive patients in Wuhan, central China. HIV transmission routes were distributed as follows: heterosexual contact, male-to-male sexual contact, intravenous drug use, blood transfusion, and unknown route. HCV antibodies were detected by a third-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HCV-positive plasmas were subjected to RNA extraction, RT-PCR amplification, and sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis characterized HCV subtypes and the evolutionary origin of circulating HCV strains. Ninety-two of 356 (25.8%) patients infected with HIV were anti-HCV-positive. Among co-infected patients, the predominant risk for HCV transmission was intravenous drug use (87.3%). Six HCV subtypes (1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, 3b, and 6a) were detected. HCV genotype 6a was most prevalent, occurring in 39.3% of all patients, followed by genotypes 1b (24.7%), 3b (18.0%), and 3a (9.8%). The least frequent genotypes were 1a (4.9%) and 2a (3.3%). Intravenous drug use was strongly associated with genotype 6a, and infection by blood or blood product transfusion was strongly associated with genotype 1b. Genotype 2a was detected only among those infected by male-to-male sexual contact. The distribution of HCV subtypes suggests that the city plays a crucial role as a hub of HCV transmission in China. Exposure to multiple risk factors associated with HCV transmission was common among patients co-infected with HIV and HCV."

An earlier study focused on the incidence of acute hepatitis C and risk factors associated with HCV transmission. The present study, based on in-depth interviews, aimed to highlight the biography, the sexual practices and the experiences of gay men infected with HCV. Beyond an apparent uniformity, the group of interviewees illustrates a variety of situations, life stories and health pathways, depending on their age. These well-adjusted gay men were used to engaging in unprotected sexual practices, but before their diagnosis they largely ignored HCV-transmission risk, which was associated in their mind with a pejorative drug addict image. Once diagnosed with acute hepatitis C, they experienced a critical and emotional period during which they were open to discuss their sexual practices and reconsider risk-reduction procedures, without being willing to give up on their satisfying sex life. Health educators should consider labelling hepatitis C as an STI in order to disrupt its negative image and to help HIV-positive gay man raise their awareness of HCV-transmission risks and implement better risk-reduction strategies."

All patients had a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of less than 100 cells/microl at study entry. Efficacy in this single-arm open-label prospective study was analyzed on an as-treated basis. No patient received highly active antiretroviral treatment, including protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, while on study medication. PCP developed in four patients, one of whom had been noncompliant. No PCP episode occurred in the first year. Probabilities of freedom from PCP were 0.97 (95%CI, 0.92-1) after 24 months and 0.93 (95%CI, 0.84-1) after 36 months. Of 74 (69.8%) patients positive for anti-toxoplasma IgG antibodies, one noncompliant patient developed toxoplasmic encephalitis after 24 months. Allergic reactions were observed in 18 (17%) patients and resulted in permanent discontinuation in 7 (6.6%) patients. One (0.9%) patient who had continued prophylaxis despite progressive hypersensitivity reactions developed a serious adverse reaction (Stevens-Johnson syndrome). The median survival of study participants was 29 months, with relentless progression of AIDS accounting for most deaths. The prophylaxis regimen studied appeared safe and effective for primary prophylaxis of PCP and toxoplasmic encephalitis. Severe adverse events can likely be prevented by discontinuation of prophylaxis at the time allergic reactions are noted. Rechallenge frequently results in tolerance. Efficacy and safety compare favorably with previously studied regimens. This simple prophylactic regimen may provide a convenient alternative for patients failing or intolerant to approved regimens."

Seven were asymptomatic (classified CDC II, according to the criteria of the Atlanta Centers for Disease Control), and 6 had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (CDC IV). Ten healthy males volunteered as controls. Plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DHEA-S), cortisol, testosterone, ACTH, and beta-endorphin were determined by RIA in blood samples obtained every 4 h from 0830-0830 h the next morning. Data were analyzed both by two-way analysis of variance and the cosinor method. Circadian rhythms were statistically validated for each of the six hormones in each of the three groups of subjects. Compared with the control subjects, mesors (24-h adjusted means) were significantly higher for cortisol and lower for DHEA, DHEA-S, and ACTH (P less than 0.001 for all four hormones) in all HIV-infected patients. Plasma testosterone mesors were similar in controls and CDC II patients, but decreased significantly in the CDC IV patient group (P less than 0.05). Analysis of the circadian rhythms of plasma hormone levels clearly indicated an altered adrenal hormonal state in HIV-infected male patients, even during the asymptomatic period of the infection. For instance, plasma cortisol at 0430 h was more than twice as high in HIV-infected patients as it was in time-qualified controls. Although patients already had elevated plasma cortisol and lowered adrenal androgen levels at this stage, hypogonadism was not observed, as gauged by plasma testosterone concentrations. We speculate that the primary hormonal defect in HIV-infected patients is increased cortisol secretion resulting from circadian-varying stimulation of the adrenal cortex by a factor other than pituitary ACTH. This factor might be a stimulating substance secreted primarily by infected immune cells. Excess cortisol would lower adrenal androgen secretion by shifting adrenal steroid biosynthesis toward glucocorticoids and decreasing pituitary ACTH secretion via a negative feedback mechanism."

The present study analyzed data from a cohort of 207 HIV-1-infected and 126 HIV-1-uninfected children and adolescents with hemophilia who enrolled in the Hemophilia Growth and Development Study and were followed for 7 years. The mean HCV RNA level was higher in the participants in the HCV genotype 1 group than in the participants the HCV non-genotype 1 group, among both the HIV-1-infected (difference, +0.33 log(10) copies/mL; P=.038) and HIV-1-uninfected (difference, +0.59 log(10) copies/mL; P=.008) participants.

The prospective cohort Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV and AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy (SUN Study) monitors the clinical course of HIV-infected individuals treated with combination antiretroviral therapy in 4 US cities. Every 6 months, clinical assessments, medical record abstraction, audio computer-assisted self-interview, and neurocognitive measurements are completed and blood and urine specimens are banked centrally. At enrollment and periodically thereafter, additional techniques such as anal cytology, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, carotid ultrasonography, echocardiography, and abdominal and cardiac computed tomography are performed. From March 2004 through June 2006, 700 participants were enrolled; median age was 41 years, 76% were men, 58% were non-Hispanic white, 62% were men who have sex with men, 78% were taking combination antiretroviral therapy (of whom 86% had an HIV viral load of <400 copies/mL), and median CD4+ T-lymphocyte count was 459 cells/mm(3) (interquartile range: 324-660). The SUN Study provides a wealth of data that will inform and improve the clinical management of HIV-infected individuals in the modern era."

HIV-infected subjects > or =18 to <25 years old receiving (> or =28 days) 300/100 mg atazanavir-ritonavir plus 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) plus one or more other nucleoside analogs underwent intensive 24-h pharmacokinetic studies following a light meal. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained at 1, 4, and 24 h postdose for quantification of intracellular tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations. Twenty-two subjects were eligible for analyses. The geometric mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) atazanavir area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC(0-24)), maximum concentration of drug in serum (C(max)), concentration at 24 h postdose (C(24)), and total apparent oral clearance (CL/F) values were 35,971 ng x hr/ml (30,853 to 41,898), 3,504 ng/ml (2,978 to 4,105), 578 ng/ml (474 to 704), and 8.3 liter/hr (7.2 to 9.7), respectively. The geometric mean (95% CI) tenofovir AUC(0-24), C(max), C(24), and CL/F values were 2,762 ng.hr/ml (2,392 to 3,041), 254 ng/ml (221 to 292), 60 ng/ml (52 to 68), and 49.2 liter/hr (43.8 to 55.3), respectively. Body weight was significantly predictive of CL/F for all three drugs. For every 10-kg increase in weight, there was a 10%, 14.8%, and 6.8% increase in the atazanavir, ritonavir, and tenofovir CL/F, respectively (P < or = 0.01). Renal function was predictive of tenofovir CL/F. For every 10 ml/min increase in creatinine clearance, there was a 4.6% increase in tenofovir CL/F (P < 0.0001). The geometric mean (95% CI) TFV-DP concentrations at 1, 4, and 24 h postdose were 96.4 (71.5 to 130), 93.3 (68 to 130), and 92.7 (70 to 123) fmol/million cells. There was an association between renal function, tenofovir AUC, and tenofovir C(max) and intracellular TFV-DP concentrations, although none of these associations reached statistical significance. In these HIV-infected young adults treated with atazanavir-ritonavir plus TDF, the atazanavir AUC was similar to those of older adults treated with the combination. Based on data for healthy volunteers, a higher tenofovir AUC may have been expected, but was not seen in these subjects. This might be due to faster tenofovir CL/F because of higher creatinine clearance in this age group. Additional studies of the exposure-response relationships of this regimen in children, adolescents, and adults would advance our knowledge of its pharmacodynamic properties."

Alternatively, such patients may develop benign self-limiting headaches. Hence, defining the various types of headache in these patients is essential for proper management. This study describes the clinical characteristics of primary headaches occurring in a group of HIV-infected patients. Of 115 patients seen from 1990 to 1996, 44 (38%) had headaches. Primary headaches were present in 29 (66%) patients and secondary causes were identified in 15 (34%). Among those with primary headaches, migraine occurred in 22 (76%), tension-type headache in 4 (14%), and cluster headache in 3 (10%) patients. Half of those with migraine (n=ll), 1 patient with tension-type headache, and 1 patient with cluster headache developed chronic daily headaches which were severe and refractory to conventional headache or antiretroviral therapy. We conclude that primary headaches in patients with HIV infection are: (1) the commonest type of headache; (2) may present for the first time in individuals with severe immunosuppression; (3) usually bear no relationship to antiretroviral drug therapy; (4) polypharmacy, depression, anxiety, and insomnia are commonly associated comorbidities; (5) frequently do not respond to conventional management and carry a poor prognosis; and (6) do not require neuroradiological and/or cerebrospinal fluid evaluations."
9647,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"In developing countries, the variations in the clinical spectrum of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related oral lesions over time, and the possible effects of antiretroviral therapy, have not been described. In this study we evaluate the clinical spectrum of oral lesions in a series of HIV-infected patients when first examined at the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) clinic of a tertiary care institution in Mexico City, Mexico, and the changes observed over 12 years. All HIV-infected adult patients had an oral examination performed by specialists in oral pathology and medicine who used established clinical diagnostic criteria for oral lesions. Four periods were defined according to the evolving pattern of antiretroviral use: the first 2 were before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and the last 2 were during more established use of HAART. For the statistical analysis the chi-square test for contingency tables and the chi-square test for trend were utilized. For dimensional variables, except age, the Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney rank sum tests were used when applicable and trend was tested with the Spearman correlation coefficient. Age was tested through analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear regression analysis. Alpha value was set at p = 0.05 for each test. In the 12-year study, 1,000 HIV-infected patients were included (87.9% male). At the baseline examination, oral lesions strongly associated with HIV were present in 47.1% of HIV-infected patients. Oral candidosis (31.6%), hairy leukoplakia (22.6%), erythematous candidosis (21.0%), and pseudomembranous candidosis (15.8%) were the most frequent lesions. Oral Kaposi sarcoma (2.3%), HIV-associated periodontal disease (1.7%), and oral non-Hodgkin lymphoma (0.1%) were less frequent. HIV-related oral lesions decreased systematically-by half during the course of the 4 study periods (p < 0.001). Except for Kaposi sarcoma, all oral lesions strongly associated with HIV showed a trend to decrease significantly during the study period. No apparent variation in the occurrence of salivary gland disease or human papillomavirus-associated oral lesions was found. A significant trend to a lower prevalence was observed in the group of patients who were already taking antiretroviral therapy, non-HAART and HAART (p < 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively). Only a discrete reduction, barely significant, was noted among untreated patients (p = 0.060). By Period IV (1999-2001), those who received HAART showed the lowest prevalence of oral lesions strongly associated with HIV (p < 0.001). Patients with oral lesions strongly associated with HIV had significantly lower median CD4+ counts and higher viral loads than those without oral lesions strongly associated with HIV (p < 0.001 and p = 0.005, respectively). When CD4+ counts were correlated with prevalence of oral candidosis, a consistently negative association was found; this association prevailed even after the study group was partitioned according to period. In this selected cohort of 1,000 patients with HIV infection, the clinical spectrum of HIV-related oral lesions has changed over the 12-year study, with a decreased prevalence of most oral lesions. Our findings probably represent improvements in medical care of HIV-infected persons, earlier detection of HIV-infected patients at the AIDS clinic, the increasing use of prophylactic drugs to prevent secondary AIDS-related opportunistic infections, and, perhaps most important, the availability of potent antiretroviral therapy in recent years, since the introduction of HAART."

To evaluate gender equity in ART access among adults (defined for this report as persons aged ≥15 years), 765,087 adult ART patient medical records from 12 countries in five geographic regions* were analyzed to estimate the ratio of women to men among new ART enrollees for each calendar year during 2002-2013. This annual ratio was compared with estimates from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)(†) of the ratio of HIV-infected adult women to men in the general population. In all 10 African countries and Haiti, the most recent estimates of the ratio of adult women to men among new ART enrollees significantly exceeded the UNAIDS estimates for the female-to-male ratio among HIV-infected adults by 23%-83%. In six African countries and Haiti, the ratio of women to men among new adult ART enrollees increased more sharply over time than the estimated UNAIDS female-to-male ratio among adults with HIV in the general population. Increased ART coverage among men is needed to decrease their morbidity and mortality and to reduce HIV incidence among their sexual partners. Reaching more men with HIV testing and linkage-to-care services and adoption of test-and-treat ART eligibility guidelines (i.e., regular testing of adults, and offering treatment to all infected persons with ART, regardless of CD4 cell test results) could reduce gender inequity in ART coverage.

15241,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"The relation between a number of potential risk factors and change in body mass index per semester was examined in a community-based cohort of 1,809 homosexual and bisexual men seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The men were followed semiannually for up to 6.5 years between 1984 and 1990. A total of 9,735 person-semesters of observations were available for analysis. A Markov-type autoregressive model, adjusting for previous body mass index, was used to predict the change in body mass index over each person-semester. Overall, the cohort was gaining weight. An asymptomatic participant 1.8 m in height whose CD4+ cell count was > 750/microliters gained a mean of 0.5 kg each person-semester. In bivariate autoregressive models, diarrhea, fever, oral thrush, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and CD4+ lymphocyte counts of < 100 and 100-199 cells/microliters were all associated with a significant decrease in body mass index. A significant inverse association was also found between change in body mass index and lymphadenopathy and herpes zoster, but when the intercept coefficient was added, no overall decrease in body mass index was seen in these models. In a final multivariate model, diarrhea was less strongly associated with a change in body mass index (p = 0.057), although AIDS (p = 0.009), fever (p = 0.006), thrush (p = 0.002), and a CD4+ lymphocyte count of < 100 cells/microliters (p < 0.001) all remained independently associated with a decrease in body mass index. Lymphadenopathy and a CD4+ lymphocyte count of 100-199 cells/microliters were also significant covariates in the final model, but neither of the beta coefficients exceeded that of the intercept, indicating that they were not independently associated with a decrease in body mass index. These findings suggest that the importance of diarrhea as a cause of HIV-related weight loss may have been over-estimated in previous clinic-based studies. AIDS and nonspecific markers of progression (fever, thrush, and a CD4+ count of < 100 cells/microliters) were the best predictors of weight loss during a semester."

Complexities surrounding patients' decisions to use ZDV in accordance with the treatment arm protocol of this study must be communicated to women, especially the consequences for both themselves and their potential children. In March 1994, a public-private partnership was formed to develop and test the impact of patient education information on 076 and to explore cultural differences in decision-making surrounding ZDV use during pregnancy. Objectives were (1) to develop an efficacious patient informational booklet on the results of ACTG 076 and (2) to determine the differential attitudes and behavioral intentions of women toward taking AZT during pregnancy. A multi-disciplinary group of providers and researchers developed the patient education booklet and field-tested it in five New York City area sites. Subjects were a multiethnic group of women of childbearing age who were predominantly HIV-positive or at risk of HIV infection (n = 120). This 076 education resulted in a substantial increase in intention to use ZDV to reduce perinatal transmission despite full disclosure of the unknowns (P < .001). There were differences in knowledge acquired between racial/ethnic groups, which must be viewed cautiously since the study did not assess socioeconomic status adequately. Attitudes toward ZDV (P < .05), trust in health care providers (P < .03), and opinions on whether testing should be voluntary (P < .02) also varied by race/ethnicity.

Tobacco use is of primary concern, given its prevalence and the medical implications of smoking among these patients. Improving responsiveness to the needs, values, and preferences of patients (i.e., patient-centeredness) is a focus for increasing participation in systems of care. To assess the social, cultural, and educational barriers limiting use of smoking cessation services by HIV-positive individuals, two focus groups were conducted at a Louisiana HIV outpatient clinic. Questions addressed smoking history, knowledge of and access to cessation services, and knowledge of effects of smoking on disease progression and medication efficacy. Identified themes included a desire for increased and more specific information on the health effects of smoking as related to the patients' HIV status, difficulty in quitting, motivation, and the increased burden of medication. These results provide recommendations for designing, for HIV-infected smokers, patient-centered treatment of tobacco use, including providing relevant knowledge, access to cessation services, and more effective messages related to the impact of tobacco use on disease progression."

However, this breakthrough was mainly the effect of introduction of the aggressive antiviral treatment, which has led to the clinically significant increase in CD4+ cell count, resulting in fewer cases of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and improved management of opportunistic infections occurring in the course of the disease. The occurrence of a particular autoimmune disease depends on degree of immunosuppression of the HIV-positive patient. In 2002, four stages of autoimmunity were proposed in patients infected by HIV, based on the absolute CD4+ cell count, feature of AIDS as well as on the presence of autoimmune diseases. Spectrum of autoimmune diseases associated with HIV infection seems to be unexpectedly wide, involving several organs, such as lungs (sarcoidosis), thyroid gland (Graves' disease), liver (autoimmune hepatitis), connective tissue (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, polyarteritis nodosa and other types of vasculitis, antiphospholipid syndrome) or hematopoietic system (autoimmune cytopenias). This paper contains the state of art on possible coincidences between HIV infection and a differential types of autoimmune diseases, including the potential mechanisms of this phenomenon. As the clinical manifestations of autoimmunization often mimic those inscribed in the course of HIV infection, health care providers should be aware of this rare but potentially deadly association and actively seek for its symptoms in their patients."

Blood samples were drawn from adult inmates in all State prisons who agreed to participate in this cross-sectional study. Data on risk behaviors were collected by using self-administered questionnaires. The prevalence of HIV, syphilis, HBV, and HCV infection was 0.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.2-1.1], 0.7% (95% CI = 0.4-1.0), 0.4 (95% CI = 0.04-0.74), and 4.8 (95% CI = 3.6-5.9), respectively. Female inmates had a higher prevalence of HIV (1.5% vs. 0.6%, p = .05), whereas male inmates had a higher prevalence of HCV (1% vs. 5%, p = .008). Twenty percent (n = 443, 95% CI = 15-26) of the participants were tattooed during incarceration, and most of them were tattooed with recycled materials. Around 60% (57%, 95% CI = 49-65) used drugs before incarceration, and 9.2% (n = 205) used injected drugs. During incarceration, 30% (95% CI = 23-39) used drugs and 43 continued injecting (20% of users). Consistent condom use was low among men before incarcerations but decreased by half during incarceration. The highest consistent condom use before incarceration was among men who have sex with men (MSM) (17.7%, 95% CI = 14-22), but it decreased (9%, 95% CI = 3-14) during incarceration. The prevalence of HIV, HBV, HCV, and syphilis in these inmates is higher than that of the local adult population. Most inmates had sex in prison, but few used condoms consistently. Access to condoms is apparently harder for MSM. Interventions to increase condom use, reduce use of shared or recycled materials for tattooing and injecting drugs, and treatment for drug abuse are needed."

This qualitative study was designed to explore and identify factors associated with engagement and retention in public and private health care in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Qualitative data from key informants (n = 12) and focus groups (n = 4 groups) of patients and providers from private and public HIV treatment facilities were recorded and transcribed. Predetermined and arising themes related to adherence, engagement, and retention in care were coded and analyzed using qualitative data analysis software. Reasons identified for patients' lack of adherence or engagement in care differed between patients and providers, and patients attributed limitations to low self-efficacy, fear and concerns about HIV, and lack of provider involvement in treatment. In contrast, providers viewed themselves as decision-makers in patient care and patients as responsible for their own nonadherence due to lack of commitment to their own health or due to medication side effects. Patients reported health care system limitations and HIV concerns contributed to a lack of engagement, and providers identified limited HIV literacy and stigma as additional problems. Both agreed that chronic illness and substance addiction impacted adherence and retention, and agreed on the importance of trust, honesty, and communication in the patient-provider relationship. Results support the incorporation of system-, provider-, and patient-focused components into interventions to facilitate patient engagement, adherence, and retention in public and private settings in Argentina.

12675,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV are common coinfections that convey a shortened lifespan, mostly related to liver disease. Treatment against HCV in the coinfected patient is notoriously more complex and challenging. There are no optimal treatment algorithms for HIV/HCV coinfected patients as efficacy of approved anti-HCV therapies is low with relevant side effects. The use of direct-acting antivirals for anti-HCV therapy has the potential to improve therapeutic efficacy, but also increase side effects and drug-drug interactions. In spite of all of this, the most important and significant fact is that chronic hepatitis C is potentially curable, and the eradication of the HCV infection is a crucial outcome in this population. The establishment of a productive collaboration among the regulatory agencies, the medical community and the pharmaceutical industry could lead to faster access to more effective HCV therapies for the coinfected patient and eventually stop the progression of liver disease in these patients."

We explored whether polymorphisms in genes important for T cell expansion, survival, and apoptosis are associated with the magnitude of CD4 lymphocyte count recovery during antiretroviral therapy. We studied treatment-naive individuals who achieved sustained control of plasma viremia (<400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) for at least 48 weeks after initiation of antiretroviral therapy and compared genotypes among individuals who had an increase of either <200 or > or =200 CD4 cells/mm3 from baseline. A total of 137 single-nucleotide polymorphisms across 17 genes were characterized in 873 study participants. In multivariate analyses that controlled for clinical variables, polymorphisms in genes encoding tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), TNF- alpha , Bcl-2-interacting molecule (Bim), interleukin (IL)-15, and IL-15 receptor alpha chain (IL-15R alpha ) were associated with the magnitude of the increase in CD4 lymphocyte count, as were haplotypes in genes encoding interferon- alpha , IL-2, and IL-15R alpha (P < .05, for each). Multifactor dimensionality reduction identified a gene-gene interaction between IL-2/IL-15 receptor common beta chain and IL-2/IL-7/IL-15 receptor common gamma chain. Immune recovery during antiretroviral therapy is a complex phenotype that is influenced by multiple genetic variants. Future studies should validate these tentative associations and define underlying mechanisms."

There were no significant differences between treatment groups for measures of plasma human immunodeficiency virus RNA (P=.851). Subcutaneous IL-2 delivered at doses of 4.5 MIU and 7.5 MIU resulted in significant increases in CD4+ cell count (P=.006 and P<.001, respectively), compared with that seen in control patients.

The monitoring of T-cell responses is complicated by the scarcity of antigen-specific T cells and the relative inefficiency of virus-specific T cells to produce effector cytokines. CD154 is a marker of activation expressed on T cells induced through their T-cell receptor. We analysed CD4 T-cell responses in 72 patients with chronic or resolved HCV infection (23 treatment naïve, 49 treatment experienced, including 16 who had achieved a sustained response). In an additional prospective protocol, 20 of the chronically infected patients were analysed before and after 8-12 weeks of combination therapy with peg-interferon-α and ribavirin. T-cell responses were measured by detecting the expression of CD154 and Th1 cytokines after stimulation with recombinant HCV proteins and were correlated with pretreatment status and outcome of therapy. Broader T-cell responses were observed in treatment naïve than in experienced patients, while the outcome of a preceding therapy regimen did not influence T-cell responses. In the prospective cohort, an on-treatment increase in CD154+ cytokine- T-cell activity was associated with response to treatment, while a decrease was observed in nonresponders. Stronger antigen-independent activity of CD154+ cytokine+ T cells was observed in responders than in nonresponders. Our data indicate that CD154 as a marker of activation of CD4 T cells is a suitable tool for the analysis of T-cell responses in patients with HCV infection."

The diagnosis of MSS was based on conventional criteria. HIV carriage was screened by an ELISA test and confirmed with the Western Blot technique. The immune status was based on CD4 lymphocyte count by flow cytometry; patients were classified as non-immunodepressed (NID), mildly immunodepressed (MID), or severely immunodepressed (SID) based on their CD4 lymphocyte count, as the latter was respectively over 500, between 200 and 500 or less than 200 per ml. Infection was treated by surgical debridement followed by a long-course targeted antibiotic therapy. All SID patients and some MID patients with AIDS-related symptoms also had standard antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. Thirty-one of 294 patients seen with musculoskeletal sepsis during the study period and tested for HIV were found to be HIV carriers. Their mean age was 33 years; the male/female ratio was 1.58. The following clinical pictures were observed: chronic osteomyelitis (COM) in 32.3% of the cases, septic arthritis (SA) in 38.7%, soft tissue infection (STI) in 25.8%; the last case was a severe leg complication of Buruli Ulcer (BU). Among these 31 patients, 38.7% were classified as SID (5 COM, 4 SA, 2 STI and the BU patient), 25.8% as MID (2 COM, 4 SA, 2 STI) and 35.5% as NID (3 COM, 6 SA, 2 STI). The organisms involved were not specific. Fifteen patients were managed conventionally, while the other 16 had the usual treatment associated with ARV therapy. The immediate outcome of MSS was good in 29 patients, after a mean hospital stay of five weeks; in two cases of septic arthritis of the knee, a second debridement was needed, due to persistent drainage, and the sinuses all closed. Three months after discharge, one patient with COM of the humerus developed a low-flow fistula which was closed after a revision sequestrectomy. After one year, none of the patients complained of any symptom suggesting reactivation of their MSS. There is no evidence that HIV carriage is in itself a high risk factor for musculoskeletal sepsis; the incidence of HIV carriage was indeed virtually similar in the 294 patients with MSS and in the general population, i.e. around 10%. However, in order to improve the outcome following musculoskeletal infections in patients with HIV, their management should take into account their immune status, based on a CD4 lymphocyte count. NID patients should be treated as any other patients with MSS, while SID should have additional standard ARV treatment. For those who are MID, the indication for antiretroviral therapy should depend on the presence of one or more AIDS-related signs."
735,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Increasing rates of HIV infection in women worldwide, especially among those of childbearing age, reinforce the importance of understanding the management of HIV in pregnancy. Over the past decade, significant advances have been made in the prevention of vertical HIV transmission, including the use of single and combination antiretroviral therapy, elective caesarean section as the preferred mode of delivery and the elimination of breast feeding. Multiple clinical trials assessing antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy have been carried out worldwide. The first pivotal clinical trial, the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 076 study, was conducted in 1994 using a three-part zidovudine regimen. Despite the success of this regimen at decreasing rates of vertical transmission, it is not affordable in many developing countries. Consequently, many international clinical trials have concentrated on short-course antiretroviral regimens including zidovudine alone, zidovudine and lamivudine, and nevirapine alone. In the developed world, the management of nonpregnant HIV-infected individuals has also undergone significant advances and has implications for the management of HIV in pregnancy. A number of countries have participated in the development of guidelines for the management of HIV in pregnancy, which recommend that HIV-infected pregnant women should be offered combination antiretroviral therapy based on viral load and CD4+ cell count cut-offs used for individuals who are not pregnant, preferably with the inclusion of zidovudine. However, to maximise the benefits to their offspring, therapy is recommended at lower viral load thresholds than for nonpregnant adults. For antiretroviral-naive women, therapy is deferred until the second trimester because of the potential and uncertain risk of teratogenesis and the low risk of transmission during this period. Research has also found that maternal factors including viral load, immune status, chorioamnionitis, prematurely ruptured membranes and, to a lesser extent, intravenous drug use and smoking are associated with increased vertical transmission. These represent potentially modifiable risk factors that should be addressed before and throughout pregnancy. Despite the benefits of antiretroviral therapy to reduce HIV vertical transmission, its use can be complicated by known and unknown risks of toxicity to the mother, fetus or both as well as carrying the risk of developing drug-resistant virus. The latter can potentially compromise future treatment options for both the mother and child. Other important challenges include the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy when the mother does not meet criteria for them for her own health, and balancing the relative risks and benefits of elective caesarean section at various degrees of viral load suppression. Clinicians managing HIV in pregnancy need to keep up to date with all the literature to provide optimal care, including counselling to allow mothers to balance the risks and benefits while deciding on treatment for both themselves and their children."

However, ENF treatment is associated with injection site reactions and dosing fatigue. This multicenter, open-label, Phase IIIb, 48-week pilot study assessed safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of the PI darunavir (DRV), boosted with ritonavir (DRV/r), and the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) etravirine (ETR), when substituted for ENF/PI (±NNRTI)-based therapy. Ten virologically suppressed (HIV RNA less than 50 copies/ml) men who were intolerant to ENF were enrolled. Median (range) CD4+ count was 301 (187-663) cells/mm(3). Two patients discontinued the study; all remaining patients maintained a viral load of less than 50 copies/ml at Week 48. Viral load increased to greater than 50 copies/ml in two patients, but was eventually re-suppressed without the need for changes in treatment. Median (range) increase (last observation carried forward) in CD4+ count from baseline to Week 48 was 64 (-53-100) cells/mm(3). Two grade 3 adverse events (AEs), nausea and weight loss, and one serious AE, acute cholecystitis, were reported; each AE resolved without treatment interruption. Most common AEs related to study drug were fatigue, rash, headache, and diarrhea. Decreases in triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein, were observed. This study suggests that a DRV/r- and ETR-based regimen can be substituted for an ENF-based regimen while maintaining virologic suppression."

In treatment-naïve adults, once-daily emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF was noninferior to once-daily emtricitabine/efavirenz/tenofovir DF with regard to establishing virological suppression over 96 weeks of therapy in a randomized, open-label, phase IIIb study (STaR). These data confirmed the findings of a pooled subset analysis of two earlier 96-week, double-blind, phase III trials (ECHO and THRIVE) in which treatment-naïve adults received either rilpivirine or efavirenz in combination with emtricitabine/tenofovir DF. However, the virological benefit of emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF in this setting appeared limited in patients with low CD4+ cell counts or high viral loads at baseline. In 48-week phase IIIb (SPIRIT) and IIb (Study 111) trials in treatment-experienced patients already virologically suppressed with a single- or multiple-tablet antiretroviral regimen and without prior virological failure, switching to once-daily emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF maintained virological suppression and was noninferior to remaining on a more complex multiple-tablet regimen in this regard. Emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF is generally well tolerated and appears to have a more favourable tolerability profile than emtricitabine/efavirenz/tenofovir DF. Thus, emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF is a welcome addition to the other single-tablet regimens currently available for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, providing a convenient and effective option for some adults who are treatment-naïve, as well as those who are already virologically suppressed on their current treatment regimen and wish to switch because of intolerance or to simplify their regimen.

1003,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the combination of at least three different antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, has greatly improved the prognosis for HIV-1-infected patients. The efficacy of a combination of a protease inhibitor (PI) plus two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been well established over a period of up to 3 years. However, virological treatment failure has been reported in 40-60% of unselected patients within 1 year after initiation of a PI-containing regimen. This observation may, at least in part, be attributed to the poor pharmacokinetic characteristics of the PIs. Given as a single agent the PIs have several pharmacokinetic limitations; relatively short plasma-elimination half-lives and a modest and variable oral bioavailability, which is, for some of the PIs, influenced by food. To overcome these suboptimal pharmacokinetics, high doses (requiring large numbers of pills) must be ingested, often with food restrictions, which complicates patient adherence to the prescribed regimen. Positive drug-drug interactions increase the exposure to the PIs, allowing administration of lower doses at reduced dosing frequencies with less dietary restrictions. In addition to increasing the potency of an antiretroviral regimen, combinations of PIs may enhance patient adherence, both of which will contribute to a more durable suppression of viral replication. The favourable pharmacokinetics of PIs in combination are a result of interactions through cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzymes and, possibly, the multi-drug transporting P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Antiretroviral synergy between PIs and non-overlapping primary resistance patterns in the HIV-1 protease genome may further enhance the antiretroviral potency and durability of combinations of PIs. Many combinations contain ritonavir because this PI has the most pronounced inhibiting effects on CYP3A4. The combination of saquinavir and ritonavir, both in a dose of 400 mg twice-a-day, is the most studied double PI combination, with clinical experience extending over 3 years. Combination of a PI with a low dose of ritonavir (< or = 400 mg/day), only to boost its pharmacokinetic properties, seems an attractive option for patients who cannot tolerate higher doses of ritonavir. A recently introduced PI, lopinavir, has been co-formulated with low-dose ritonavir, which allows for a convenient three-capsules, twice-a-day dosing regimen. In an attempt to prolong suppression of viral replication combinations of PIs are becoming increasingly popular. However, further clinical studies are needed to identify the optimal combinations for treatment of antiretroviral naive and experienced HIV-1-infected patients. This review covers combinations of saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir and lopinavir with different doses of ritonavir, as well as the combinations of saquinavir and indinavir with nelfinavir."

The drug is administered in combination with low-dose ritonavir, to boost atazanavir pharmacokinetics (i.e. ritonavir-boosted atazanavir), and other antiretroviral agents. The efficacy of once-daily ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus background therapy (BT) in establishing virologic suppression in treatment-naive pediatric patients (aged 6 to <18 years) infected with HIV-1 was demonstrated in an ongoing, open-label, multicenter, phase I/II trial (PACTG 1020A). HIV-1 RNA levels of <50 or <400 copies/mL were achieved by the majority of patients (>70%) after 24 weeks' therapy, with these benefits maintained at week 48. Some treatment-experienced pediatric patients (aged 6 to <18 years) also achieved HIV-1 RNA levels of <50 or <400 copies/mL in the PACTG 1020A trial after 24 (≤45% of patients) and 48 (≤32%) weeks of treatment with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus BT, although the benefits of the regimen in this patient population appeared to be limited by as few as one or two protease inhibitor resistance mutations. Treatment-experienced pediatric patients (aged 10-19 years) infected with HIV-1 had mixed success in establishing/maintaining virologic suppression when they were switched from their current antiretroviral treatment regimen to once-daily ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus BT in a small, single-center, observational study. However, some patients may have received atazanavir at a suboptimal dosage or had suboptimal susceptibility to BT agents. In the PACTG 1020A trial, use of atazanavir (with or without ritonavir) in pediatric patients aged 6 to <18 years was associated with a similar safety profile to that reported in adults."

Half of 32 patients assigned to the two arms containing flucytosine were randomized to oral and half to intravenous flucytosine. Early fungicidal activity was determined from serial quantitative cultures of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and toxicity was assessed by clinical and laboratory monitoring. Flucytosine and fluorouracil concentrations in plasma and CSF were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. No significant bone marrow or hepatotoxicity was seen, there was no detectable difference in bone marrow toxicity between patients on intravenous and those on oral formulation, and no patients discontinued treatment. In patients receiving intravenous flucytosine, the median 24-h area under the concentration-time curve was significantly higher than in the oral group. Despite this difference, there was no difference in early fungicidal activity between patients on intravenous compared with patients on oral flucytosine. The results suggest that either formulation can be used safely at this dosage in a developing country setting, without drug concentration monitoring. The bioavailability of the oral formulation may be reduced in late-stage HIV-infected patients in Thailand. Concentrations of flucytosine with intravenous formulation at 100 mg/kg/day may be in excess of those required for maximal fungicidal activity."

Youths' risk level for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection during adolescence was categorized as high (engaging in prostitution, male homosexual or bisexual activity, or injectable drug use or having ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases), moderate (having six or more sex partners in a 1-year period or nonulcerative sexually transmitted diseases), or low (none of the above). Although a proportion at high or moderate risk during adolescence did move to lower risk levels by young adulthood, the overall risk level stayed fairly stable: 45% were at high or moderate risk levels during adolescence, and 35% were at those levels by young adulthood. Then change in the total number of risk behaviors engaged in by the youths was examined. Knowledge about AIDS or HIV infection and its prevention was not associated with any change in risk behavior, nor were the number of sources of information about the epidemic, acquaintance with those who are infected, estimates of personal risk, or exposure to HIV-test counseling. In fact, youths whose risk behaviors increased the most were more likely to know someone who had died of AIDS and to estimate their own risk as high. Most youths reported that they did not use condoms regularly, disliked them, and had little confidence in their protective ability. Changes in preventive strategies and further research on the causes of behavior change are needed."

In the same period there were 8459 laboratory reports of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody-positive tests. Since 1985 the median interval of 2 months between diagnosis and report of AIDS has not changed. Most patients with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) as an indicator disease when AIDS was diagnosed were homosexual/bisexual males; the proportion in this category has declined. The data support the hypothesis for a co-factor in the aetiology of KS in homosexual/bisexual males and that the effect of this co-factor has progressively weakened. Injecting drugs was a risk factor for 48 patients with AIDS (4%), half of whom were also homosexual/bisexual males, and for 1406 (17%) persons reported as HIV antibody-positive of whom 63 were also homosexual/bisexual males. HIV-infected persons injecting drugs were reported from all parts of the U.K., apart from Northern Ireland, but the cumulative rate per million population in Scotland for such persons was more than six times the rate elsewhere. In the collaborative laboratory study in England, 2.3% of over 3000 persons injecting drugs were HIV antibody-positive; among those who were asymptomatic the prevalence in London was 7.1% compared with 1.3% outside London. By 1987, the incidence rate of acute hepatitis B in persons injecting drugs in England had fallen to less than a third of that for 1985; in Scotland the figure for 1987 was only a quarter of that for 1985. Since the current rate of HIV transmission among persons in the U.K. injecting drugs is unknown, monitoring the prevalence of HIV in this risk group should be intensified."
8341,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"The HIV epidemic in Estonia affects the population of people who inject drugs (PWID) the most, but factors associated with adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among PWID have not been thoroughly examined in Estonia, with particularly limited data regarding beliefs and attitudes of PWID. The objective of this study was to explore the association between ART adherence and individual beliefs, perceived effectiveness of ART, and self-rated health in particular, in this specific population. The study used baseline survey data from a longitudinal intervention study of HIV prevention among PWID in Estonia, in which 107 HIV-infected participants reported current use of ART. Current adherence was measured through the use of a visual analog scale. Approximately half (49%) of the participants reported optimal (≥95%) adherence. The vast majority (81%) believed in the effectiveness of ART. Less than a quarter of the participants (22%) rated their health as good or very good, and a half (52%) reported average health. Individual beliefs and self-reported health were not associated with ART adherence in both bivariate and multivariable analyses. Participants with problem drinking reported significant suboptimal adherence to ART (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.19-0.97). Daily injection drug use was also associated with suboptimal adherence (AOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.91). Problem drinking has not been commonly reported as a factor of suboptimal ART adherence among PWID; further research would be useful to identify the pathways that might be involved."
3567,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Clinical trials have shown that the prophylactic use of zidovudine and aerosolized pentamidine (or other antibiotics used as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-free human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons delays the development of AIDS, but the effectiveness of such therapy in general use in the population still remains largely undocumented. To help answer this question, the authors estimate the effectiveness of this therapy in a population-based cohort of HIV-infected homosexual and bisexual men in San Francisco. The authors use a continuous-time Markov process to model the decline of CD4+ T-lymphocytes (T4-cells) measured in cells/microliter in HIV-infected persons. The model partitions the HIV (type 1) infection period into six progressive T4-cell count intervals (stages), followed by a seventh stage: AIDS diagnosis. The authors use maximum likelihood methods to fit the model to the observed transitions for 428 HIV-infected men during June 1984 to March 1991, from the San Francisco Men's Health Study. Since zidovudine was not widely used before 1988, the model has a component that controls for calendar time-related biases. The fitted model provides statistical estimates and confidence intervals for measuring therapy effectiveness. The authors estimate that prophylactic therapy reduces the progression rate from stage 4 (T4-cell count, 350-499) to stage 5 (T4-cell count, 200-349) by a factor of 0.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.22 to 0.55); from stage 5 to stage 6 (T4-cell count < 200) by a factor of 0.33 (95% CI 0.04-0.54); and from stage 6 to 7 (AIDS) by a factor of 0.62 (95% CI 0.47-0.73). In addition, therapy started by an HIV-infected person in stage 4 is estimated to reduce the risk of developing AIDS by a factor of 0.83 (95% CI 0.46-0.94) at 6 months and 0.68 (95% CI 0.35-0.89) at 24 months after entering stage 4. Therapy started by HIV-infected persons in more advanced stages is estimated to reduce the risk of developing AIDS by factors ranging from 0.70 (95% CI 0.39-0.90), early in stage 5, to 0.28 (95% CI 0.14-0.45), late in stage 6. Thus, the prophylactic use of zidovudine and pentamidine in routine medical care has a strong, consistent, and significant effect in slowing the clinical course of HIV infection in a population-based cohort."
18802,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Previous studies on patients who develop drug resistant HIV-1 variants have shown that continued use of failing regimens might provide clinical benefit. However, the effect of long-term exposure to drug resistant variants may lead to emergence of compensatory mutations that may jeopardize this effect. In this study, we assess associations among type and number of drug resistant mutations, viral load and disease progression in patients with long-term follow up. Patients with genotypic testing performed at the time of treatment failure were enrolled. Comparison of viral load and CD4 cell count between different resistance groups was performed using analysis of variance. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to assess the simultaneous effects of the presence of particular mutations and their accumulation on viral load. Data from 475 patients who were followed for a median of 43 months from October 1999 to July 2005 were studied. A ""V shape"" relationship was observed between the number of mutations and viral load. Specifically, in patients harboring up to five mutations, viral load was reduced by 0.8 log/copies when compared to wild-type variants. However, with more than six mutations viral load progressively increased. Certain reverse transcriptase mutations such as M184V/I, K70R, V108I, and protease mutations such as L33FIV, M84V, and M36I were associated with reduced viral load. Together, these findings suggest that long-term maintenance of a sub-optimal antiretroviral regimen may have deleterious consequences for the patient."

Cytoreductive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (CTX) reduces cells in LT, and we hypothesized that coadministration of antiretroviral therapy with CTX may diminish the cellular reservoir over time. Ten antiretroviral treatment-naive subjects were recruited, and they received stavudine, lamivudine and nelfinavir (antiretroviral therapy, ART) until 2 consecutive plasma HIV RNA levels measured < 50 copies/ml (step 1). Five subjects then received ART alone, whereas five subjects received ART plus three escalating doses of CTX (step 2). Viral DNA was measured in LT obtained by excisional lymph node biopsy and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), using quantitative polymerase chain reaction at three time points in both groups (before steps 1 and 2, and after CTX). Viral DNA declined in both groups after the initiation of ART alone in step 1. During step 2 both groups experienced a modest decline compared with step 1. However, no significant differences were observed in viral DNA in LT or PBMCs between the ART alone and the ART plus CTX groups. Suppression of plasma HIV RNA levels < 50 copies/ml was not maintained in the ART plus CTX group, perhaps because of inadequate medication adherence. The group receiving ART plus CTX had lower CD4(+) lymphocyte counts and absolute total lymphocytes compared with the ART alone group. We conclude that the addition of CTX to ART did not diminish the cellular reservoir in HIV-infected persons."

This article is about how HIV-positive Muslims and providers balance ART with religious tenets and obligations. I conducted 17 months of multi-site ethnographic research between 2007 and 2010, including participant-observation in an urban HIV clinic in Kano, Nigeria and a support group for people living with HIV, as well as in-depth interviews with 30 HIV-positive men and 30 key informants with caregiving, clinical, or policy roles related to HIV/AIDS. Patients migrated from Islamic prophetic medicine to ART when it became more widely available in the mid-2000s through the U.S. PEPFAR program. At the same time, a conceptual shift occurred away from considering HIV immediately curable through spiritual and herbal-based Islamic prophetic medicine toward considering HIV as a chronic infection that requires adherence to daily pill regimens. Hope for a complete cure and encouragement from some Islamic prophetic healers resulted in some patients forgoing ART. Patients and providers adapted biomedical treatment guidelines to minimize disruption to religious practices also considered essential to Muslims' wellbeing, irrespective of HIV status. Providers discouraged patients on second-line ART from fasting because such patients had fewer treatment options and, often, poorer health. However, patients' medication adherence was affected by the desire to fulfill fasting obligations and to avoid questions from family and friends unaware of their HIV-positive status. This study is one of few ethnographic accounts of HIV treatment in a Muslim-majority society and contributes to understanding the significance of religion for HIV treatment in northern Nigeria. It has implications for public health programming and clinical approaches to HIV treatment in medically pluralistic Muslim societies."

While prevalence studies on HIV/HCV coinfection have been performed in the U.S. and in some European countries, little is known about HCV genotype distribution in Latin America. The main objective was to evaluate the HCV prevalence and genotypes among HIV co-infected patients, and their relationship with HCV viral load, serum ALT level and T lymphocyte CD4+ cell count. These data pursue to increase the knowledge from South America about a pressing problem from HIV-infected patients. Retrospectively collected specimens from 593 HIV-positive individuals in Argentina were tested for anti-HCV These were analyzed for HCV-RNA qualitatively and quantitatively. The HCV genotype was determined by the RFLP method. One hundred and twenty-nine (21.7%) HIV-infected individuals were anti-HCV positive; 65.9% of them exhibited detectable HCV-RNA. Genotype 1 (43, la/c; 9, 1b; and 5, 1a/c+1b) was present in 57, while 1, 14 and 13 were infected with genotype 2, 3 or a mix, respectively. Co-infected individuals were more likely to be male, without significant differences in age and CD4+ cell counts than HIV-monoinfected individuals. HCV infection prevalence in patients co-infected with HIV highlights the impending public health impact of this problem. Considering the increasing rate of HCV genotypes with lower response rates to treatment among HIV co-infected patients, antiretroviral therapy success might be jeopardized by HCV coinfection."
13152,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) often suffer from weight loss manifested by a loss of body cell mass (BCM). The causes of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated wasting may include anorexia, malabsorption, and a variety of altered metabolic states. Malabsorption and diarrhea may result from gastrointestinal tract opportunistic infections or from direct effects of HIV on the gastrointestinal tract. Infection with HIV may produce metabolic derangements that alter nutrient utilization, resulting in loss of BCM. Nutritional assessment of the patient with AIDS should include an evaluation of BCM and physical and psychosocial functioning. Antiretroviral therapy and eradication of opportunistic infections do not always reverse wasting. Treatment should include nutritional counseling. Total parenteral nutrition is sometimes of benefit, particularly in patients with damaged gastrointestinal tracts. Dronabinol and megestrol acetate may promote weight gain; however, dronabinol may have adverse effects, and most of the gain with megestrol acetate is in fat rather than BCM. If gonadal dysfunction is present, testosterone replacement therapy should be included in the treatment plan. Some studies suggest that oral anabolic steroids may improve muscle strength and body composition. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, mammalian-derived human growth hormone (rhGH[m]) has produced sustained weight and BCM gains in AIDS patients. If a patient continues to lose BCM after the above factors have been addressed and corrected, a 12-week course of rhGH[m] is indicated. Halting the progression of HIV-associated wasting may improve survival, enhance physical and social functioning, and enrich quality of life."
16989,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Weight loss and wasting have long been established as strong predictors of mortality in HIV-infected patients. Today, despite the effectiveness of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), there is evidence that HIV-related wasting is still an important comorbidity in many patients. We conducted a study to determine if wasting is still associated with decreased survival in patients receiving HAART and which parameter (weight, fat-free mass [FFM], body cell mass [BCM], or fat mass [FM]) is most strongly associated with mortality. The study population consisted of 678 HIV-positive participants enrolled in the Nutrition for Healthy Living study. Weight, FFM, BCM, and FM were assessed for all participants at 6-month intervals. At each follow-up visit, percent losses of each parameter were calculated from values at baseline and the previous visit. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate and compare the relative risks of death for each parameter, adjusting for potential confounders such as HAART use, body mass index, and CD4 cell counts. In analyses examining the parameters separately and together in the same model, weight loss emerged as the strongest independent predictor of mortality. Weight loss of >or=10% from baseline or the previous visit was significantly associated with a four- to sixfold increase in mortality compared with maintenance or gaining of weight. Even one episode of weight loss of >or=3% from baseline or >or=5% from the previous visit was predictive of mortality. In summary, despite the apparent benefits of HAART use on HIV-related survival, weight loss remains an independent predictor of mortality. In addition, FFM or BCM estimated using bioelectrical impedance analysis does not add further prognostic value over weight loss."

Several studies have shown that patients can successfully be treated for HCV in the context of methadone maintenance programmes, but little evidence exists evaluating HCV treatment models for substance users where methadone maintenance is not indicated. This retrospective cohort study involved 129 persons participating in psycho-educational support groups and integrated, interprofessional, community-based health services focused on the treatment for HCV among marginalized populations with high rates of crack cocaine use and mental health comorbidities. We sought to identify the factors associated with antiviral treatment uptake. Group participation improved access to health care. While 19% had previously seen an HCV specialist prior to group initiation, 59% saw an HCV specialist during the group. Half of the participants were nonimmune to hepatitis A or B at baseline, and 80% of these patients received immunization through the programme. The programme treated 24 patients with pegylated interferon and ribavirin and achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR) rate of 91% for genotype 2 or 3 and 54% for genotype 1. Stable housing was independently associated with initiation of treatment, and there was a nonsignificant trend towards lower rates of treatment initiation among women. SVR rates for those who had used crack or injection drugs in the month prior to joining the programme did not differ significantly from those who had abstained."

We studied 129 antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive HIV-1 infected patients who received an antiretroviral regimen of lamivudine, efavirenz and Tenofovir GPO300 (n = 65) or Viread (n = 64). We examined plasma tenofovir concentrations (12 hours after dosing), serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Modification in Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study formula, fractional excretion of phosphate (FEphos), CD4 and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at 12 weeks, and CD4 and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at 24 weeks after initiating the drugs. At baseline, the mean ± SD subject body weight was 54 ± 10 kilograms and the mean ± SD subject age was 37 ± 8 years. At baseline, the median (IQR) CD4 count was 44 (18-120) cells/ mm3 and the median (IQR) HIV-1 RNA level was 5.8 log copies/ml. At baseline, the mean ± SD eGFR was 134.8 ± 43.6 ml/min/1.73 m2. The baseline values for the two groups were not significantly different from each other (p > 0.05). At 12 weeks, the mean ± SD plasma tenofovir concentration was 106.9 ± 41.5 ng/ml among the patients who received Tenofovir GPO300 and 100.7 ± 49.4 ng/ml among those who received Viread (p = 0.437). At week 12, there were no differences between those who rceived Tenofovir GPO300 and Vilead in mean serum creatinine (0.78 vs 0.81 mg/dl, p = 0.283), mean eGFR (117.9 vs 109.1 ml/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.089), decline in eGFR from baseline (-21.8 vs -20.6 ml/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.860) or mean FEphos (11.4 vs 11.2, p = 0.923). The median CD4 cell counts and number of patients with undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA at week 24 were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between those who took Tenofovir GPO300 and Viread. In summary, plasma tenofovir concentrations, changes in renal function, urinary phosphate excretion and treatment responses were comparable between HIV-infected patients who received Tenofovir GPO300 and Viread-containing non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase regimens."

Previous investigators estimated eligibility for hepatitis C therapy among the coinfected patients, but all had significant methodological limitations. Our study is the first to use a multi-year, statewide, population-based sample to estimate treatment eligibility, and the first to estimate eligibility in the setting of an interferon-free regimen. In a population-based sample of 161 patients infected with HIV and hepatitis C living in Oregon during 2007-2010, 21% were eligible for hepatitis C therapy. Despite the anticipation surrounding an interferon-sparing regimen, eligibility assuming an interferon-free regimen increased only to 26%, largely due to multiple simultaneous contraindications. Obesity was described for the first time as being associated with decreased eligibility (OR: 0.11). Active alcohol abuse was the most common contraindication (24%); uncontrolled mental health (22%), recent injection drug use (21%), poor antiretroviral adherence (22%), and infection (21%) were also common excluding conditions. When active drug or alcohol abuse was excluded as contraindications to therapy, the eligibility rate was 34%, a 62% increase. Assuming an interferon-free regimen and the exclusion of active drug or alcohol abuse as contraindications to therapy, the eligibility rate increased to 42%. Despite the availability of direct-acting anti-viral regimens, eligibility rates in HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection are modest. Many factors precluding hepatitis C therapy are reversible, and targeted interventions could result in increased eligibility. "

This study addresses these limitations through an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of HIV-free survival outcomes of nine randomized controlled trials to prevent early mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. The pooled sample consisted of 3,324 African children in resource-limited settings who survived to age 28 days and were at-risk of acquiring HIV through breast milk. Based on a proportional hazards mixed effects meta-analysis, the composite endpoint of HIV-1 infection and all-cause mortality was found to be significantly associated with maternal immune status (CD4(+) ≥350 cells/mm(3), HR 0.59 95% CI (0.39, 0.87)), infant preterm delivery (gestational age <37 weeks, 1.40 (1.03, 1.89)), infant oral candidiasis infection (1.87, (1.53, 2.29)), and occurrence of breast abnormality before breastfeeding cessation (2.56 (1.90, 3.46)). A significant interaction between mother's parity (any previous pregnancy) and CD4(+) count ≥350 (HR 0.63 (0.40, 0.99), P-value = 0.045) suggested that higher CD4(+) count offsets the risk associated with higher parity. Further research is needed to elucidate the moderating effect of immune status on the risk associated with high parity and adverse late postnatal outcomes for infants breastfed by HIV-infected mothers in the absence of antiretroviral treatment."

For HIV-HCV-coinfected individuals, the burden of disease is largely related to their HCV diseases, including a faster progression to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver-related deaths. In the present thesis we investigated factors associated with spontaneous resolution and progression of HIV-HCV coinfection. In study I, we identified the study cohort of 327 individuals with HIV-HCV coinfection and a rate of spontaneous HCV resolution of 23%. We showed that female sex, coinfection with hepatitis B virus and individuals exposed through injecting drug use (IDU) or homosexual contact (MSM) had an increased rate of spontaneous HCV resolution. We speculate that differences in resolution rate may be caused by immunological memory induced by repeatedly being exposed to low-dose inoculum of HCV. In study II, we found three single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) in the interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene associated with spontaneous HCV resolution in 208 Europeans of Caucasian origin with HIV-HCV coinfection. Further, we showed that the IL28B CC genotype favourable of HCV resolution was associated with a higher HCV viral load (VL) than non-CC genotypes. These results may indicate an influence of IL28B in viral control. In study III, we conducted a survival analysis in the 264 HIV-HCV-coinfected individuals with chronic infection. We showed in a time-updated Poisson regression that HCV VL, HCV genotype 3 and IL28B CC genotype were predictors of increased mortality. This may indicate a need for closer observation in HIV-HCV-coinfected individuals with HCV genotype 3 and maybe even initiation of antiviral therapy. "

The CCR5Delta32 mutation, which is associated with resistance to infection in homozygous individuals and delayed disease progression in heterozygous individuals, is rare in Africa, where the HIV-1 epidemic is growing rapidly. Several polymorphisms in the promoter region of CCR5 have been identified, the clinical and functional relevance of which remain poorly defined. We evaluated the effect of 4 CCR5 promoter mutations on systemic and mucosal HIV-1 replication, disease progression, and perinatal transmission in a cohort of 276 HIV-1-seropositive women in Nairobi, Kenya. Mutations at positions 59353, 59402, and 59029 were not associated with effects on mortality, virus load, genital shedding, or transmission in this cohort. However, women with the 59356 C/T genotype had a 3.1-fold increased risk of death during the 2-year follow-up period (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-9.5) and a significant increase in vaginal shedding of HIV-1-infected cells (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0-4.3), compared with women with the 59356 C/C genotype."

This case series presents 3 patients with clinically significant renal disease and positive test results for anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antigen. Characteristic histological findings that would suggest anti-GBM antibodies have a significant role in the pathological state of each patient's kidney disease were absent. In addition, each patient recovered without specific treatment for anti-GBM disease. This case series suggests that anti-GBM antibodies likely are related to the B-cell expansion previously described in patients with HIV infection. We propose that clinicians interpret results of anti-GBM antibody tests carefully for patients with HIV infection, considering biopsy before empiric therapy, particularly in a clinical presentation that is atypical for Goodpasture disease."

Serum samples were collected from this group and analysed, by ELISA, for antibodies against HIV as well as for serological markers for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). As we have previously described, we found a high prevalence of HBV (26.4%) and HCV (4.2%) markers as compared to the prevalence of these markers in samples of normal blood donors from Uberlândia's Hemocentro Regional, which are 4% and 0.4%, respectively. Of the 131 patients, four (3%) had antibodies against HIV, three (75%) of which were injecting drug users (IDU). In the HIV-negative group, only one patient was an IDU. The prevalence of HIV in our population, according to data from the city's Health Secretary, varies from 3.1% to 6.2%. We conclude that, at least for the moment, alcoholism per se, did not constitute an important risk factor for HIV infection. However, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is a rather recent disease as compared to hepatitis B and C and, as the transmission routes are similar for HIV and hepatitis viruses, an increase in the incidence of HIV infection in alcoholics may be just a question of time."

The response rate was 63.9%. Of the 3339 respondents 22.7% knew of an asymptomatic HIV positive patient within their practice, 5.4% knew of a symptomatic HIV positive patient and 6.4% knew of a patient with AIDS. The estimated annual rate for HIV-related consultations in general practice (including consultations with the 'worried well') was 6.5 per 1000 population. HIV-related consultations occurred more frequently in the four Thames health regions than elsewhere. A sample of 715 practitioners who reported consultations with HIV infected people or those with worries about infection in the previous month, were invited to keep a diary of HIV-related consultations for one week. The response rate to the diary was 64%. Nineteen per cent of the 273 consultations recorded in the diaries were initiated by homosexual men, 16.5% by injecting drug users, 10.3% by the sexual partners of people at risk of infection; 42.9% of consultations were not associated with recognized risk factors. The results indicate that general practitioners have substantial contact with patients with HIV infection, with AIDS and with worries about HIV infection or AIDS. This contact is likely to increase, alongside the anticipated spread of HIV infection, with consequent implications for general practice resources."

This study evaluated whether high-potency NAs (entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF]) reduce the risk of tumour recurrence more potently than low-potency NAs after curative treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. This study included 607 consecutive HBV-related HCC patients treated with surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation. The patients were categorized into three groups according to antiviral treatment: group A (no antiviral; n = 261), group B (low-potency NA; n = 90) and group C (high-potency NA; n = 256). The primary end-point was recurrence-free survival (RFS). During the duration of follow-up, the median RFS was 29.4, 25.1, and 88.2 months in groups A, B and C, respectively (P < .001, log-rank test). The multivariate Cox analysis indicated that group C had a significantly longer RFS than both group A (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.39, P < .001) and group B (adjusted HR = 0.47, P < .001). When baseline characteristics were balanced using inverse probability weighting, group C still had a significantly longer RFS than group A (adjusted HR = 0.46, P < .001) and group B (adjusted HR = 0.59, P = .007). Group C had significantly lower risk of viral breakthrough than group B (HR = 0.19, P < .001). Viral breakthrough was an independent risk factor for shorter RFS among groups B and C (adjusted HR = 2.03, P = .007, time-dependent Cox analysis). Antiviral agents with high genetic barrier to resistance (entecavir and TDF) reduced the risk of HCC recurrence compared with other antivirals and no antiviral treatment, especially in patients with high baseline viral load."

This patient population presents particular features and various complicating conditions requiring special treatment strategies. Interferon, the standard treatment for HBV infection, has been poorly tolerated by patients with chronic kidney disease, has presented relatively low efficacy, and has posed renal transplant recipients under the risk of acute rejection. The advent of effective nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) has offered the opportunity to minimize the consequences of HBV infection in HBV-positive patients with chronic kidney disease. Combination with immunosuppressive agents might be considered in cases of rapid renal function deterioration and/or severe proteinuria. Among the newer NAs, entecavir may be preferred, because of its high potency, high genetic barrier to resistance, and favorable renal safety profile. However, entecavir presented low efficacy in case of lamivudine or telbivudine resistance, and thus tenofovir may be a better option in that setting. All HBsAg-positive candidates should be treated with NAs before renal transplantation in order to maintain undetectable HBV DNA, reduce liver fibrosis, and prevent hepatic decompensation after renal transplantation. This review summarizes updated issues related to treatment of chronic HBV infection in all categories of population with chronic kidney disease (those exhibiting HBV-associated glomerular disease, those treated with hemodialysis, as well as renal transplant candidates, donors, and recipients).

However, inadequate information is available to aid women and health care professionals in weighing the potential risks of hormonal contraceptive use in individuals living with HIV-1 or at high risk of infection. Numerous epidemiological studies and challenge studies in a rhesus macaque model suggest that progesterone-based contraceptives increase the risk of HIV-1 infection in humans and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in macaques, accelerate disease progression, and increase viral shedding in the genital tract. However, because several other studies in humans have not observed any effect of exogenously administered progesterone on HIV-1 acquisition and disease progression, the issue continues to be a topic of intense research and ongoing discussion. In contrast to progesterone, systemic or intravaginal treatment with estrogen efficiently protects female rhesus macaques against the transmission of SIV, likely by enhancing the natural protective properties of the lower genital tract mucosal tissue. Although the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the effect of sex steroid hormones on HIV-1 and SIV acquisition and disease progression are not well understood, progesterone and estrogen are known to regulate a number of immune mechanisms that may exert an effect on retroviral infection. This review summarizes current knowledge of the effects of various types of sex steroid hormones on immune processes involved in the biology of HIV-1 infection."

World prevalence greater than 30% of coinfected cases is estimated, and it can reach 90% depending on the transmission route. With the aim of determining the frequency and profile of HIV/HCV coinfected patients, a descriptive analysis was carried out with patients with HIV/AIDS whose serology was positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV), cared for at the Fundação de Medicina Tropical do Amazonas from 2000 to 2007. In the present study, of the 2,653 AIDS cases notified in SINAN, 1,582 patients underwent serology test for hepatitis C, and a frequency of 4.42% (n = 70) of HIV/HCV coinfected patients was identified in the period studied. The most frequent infection route was sexual transmission (84.3%), 68.6% among heterosexual individuals. Most patients were males (72.9%), aged between 25 and 40 years (60.1%), of low income (50% earning up to one minimum wage), and low educational level (80% had completed only middle school). A high percentage of deaths were observed during the study (34.3%). The results indicate a low seroprevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection in this population, in which sexual transmission, characterized by sexual promiscuity among heterosexual individuals, is the major transmission route of the virus rather than the use of injection drugs, as shown in world statistics."

Serial imaging studies revealed progressive occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and both anterior cerebral arteries with development of collateral circulation. The workup for other etiologies of stroke was negative. This nonatherosclerotic occlusive disease is most likely secondary to vasculopathy caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of children who present with seizures, mental status change or focal neurological deficits. Treatment options are limited.

The critical incident technique was used to identify factors determining adherence. Through a series of brief, focused interviews, patients were asked to recall specific incidents that affected their adherence to HIV medications. Patients' responses were grouped into categories using Ethnograph software. Two nurse experts, with 94% agreement, determined the reliability of the category listings. A chi(2) analysis compared the proportion of patients reporting each factor across age, ethnicity, and intravenous drug use categories. The total sample of 52 participants included 46 male outpatients with HIV/AIDS receiving care through a Veteran's Administration Hospital in northern California and 6 health care providers. The interviews yielded a total of 294 incidents. Six major categories were identified, and a taxonomy of critical factors determining highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) adherence was developed. The categories included reminders and cues (30%), planning (18%), response to HIV/AIDS (17%), HIV medication characteristics (14%), interactions with others (12%), and patient characteristics (10%). The two largest categories representing patient-related factors accounted for nearly half of the incidents. Patients most influenced by positive support from others included non-Caucasians, those under the age of 50 years, and those with fewer years of education. The taxonomy of adherence behaviors provides important information for developing culturally relevant patient adherence education programs and an essential foundation for developing future studies."

Men accounted for an unexpected majority (88%), 36 (20%) were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected and for 45 (24%) mining was their primary occupation. A poor outcome (death, default, or persistent smear positivity after 7 months of treatment) was found in 37 (23%). HIV infection was the only significant predictor of poor outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-5.83, P = 0.034). Interventions to minimize need for retreatment or improve retreatment success may be regionally specific.

A longitudinal cohort study in eight HIV-1 infected individuals following a clinically indicated therapy change (seven for drug intolerance and one for virological failure) from protease inhibitor (PI) to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based antiretroviral regimens was performed. CD4 T-cell counts, viral loads, lymphoproliferative responses, cytokine production and latent proviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) were measured at baseline and at weeks 12 and 24 after therapy substitution. Following therapy-switch there was a 33% proportional increase in mitogen response (95% confidence interval (CI), 3-33%) and a 31% increase (95% CI, 15-48%) in viral and recall-antigen responses. Six patients developed proliferative responses to low concentration IL-2 stimulation. All patients demonstrated an increase in median HIV-1-specific responses, as three had detectable virus at baseline (two being viral rebound); this may reflect an autovaccination effect. Proviral DNA changes largely reflected plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA). In conclusion, NNRTI substitution for a PI may favour immune reconstitution with an improvement in HIV-1-specific responses, which may reflect differential effects on antigen processing and presentation, an autovaccination effect or alternatively a potential suppressive effect of the PI."

Non-adherence negatively impacts patient outcome and the larger economy. However, data on adherence among the Belgian HIV cohort are scarce. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to identify determinants of adherence among HIV patients treated in Belgium. The study was conducted at the Aids Reference Centre of Ghent University Hospital between 1 January and 31 December 2012. Sociodemographic data were collected, along with the Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ), the Center for Adherence Support Evaluation (CASE) Adherence Index, the EuroQol-6D, the Medical Outcomes Study-HIV (MOS-HIV), the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and three neurocognitive complaints screening questions. To date, 218 patients participated in the study, among whom 173 (79·4%) were male. Mean age was 46·0±10·6 years and 133 patients (63·9%) were homosexual. According to the SMAQ and the CASE, 78·5% and 93·5% of the patients were adherent to antiretroviral therapy. Logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking, neurocognitive complaints, and female sex were independent determinants of non-adherence. In conclusion, there is an elevated risk for non-adherence in smokers, people experiencing neurocognitive problems, and women in our sample. The latter could reflect differences between male and female HIV patients in Belgium. Adherence improving initiatives should be tailored to these three risk groups. "

We hypothesized that HIV infection, which induces immunodeficiency, will alter the sympatric relationship between M. tuberculosis and its human host. To test this hypothesis, we performed a nine-year nation-wide molecular-epidemiological study of HIV-infected and HIV-negative patients with tuberculosis (TB) between 2000 and 2008 in Switzerland. We analyzed 518 TB patients of whom 112 (21.6%) were HIV-infected and 233 (45.0%) were born in Europe. We found that among European-born TB patients, recent transmission was more likely to occur in sympatric compared to allopatric host-pathogen combinations (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 7.5, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.21-infinity, p = 0.03). HIV infection was significantly associated with TB caused by an allopatric (as opposed to sympatric) M. tuberculosis lineage (OR 7.0, 95% CI 2.5-19.1, p<0.0001). This association remained when adjusting for frequent travelling, contact with foreigners, age, sex, and country of birth (adjusted OR 5.6, 95% CI 1.5-20.8, p = 0.01). Moreover, it became stronger with greater immunosuppression as defined by CD4 T-cell depletion and was not the result of increased social mixing in HIV-infected patients. Our observation was replicated in a second independent panel of 440 M. tuberculosis strains collected during a population-based study in the Canton of Bern between 1991 and 2011. In summary, these findings support a model for TB in which the stable relationship between the human host and its locally adapted M. tuberculosis is disrupted by HIV infection."

Information on hospitalizations was obtained through data linkage with the BC Ministry of Health. Cox-proportional hazard models were used to assess variables associated with time to hospitalization. A total of 1,605 people were eligible and 672 (42%) were hospitalized for one or more days. The final multivariate model indicated that there was an increased risk of hospitalization among those with high baseline HIV RNA (HR for > 100,000 copies/mL: 1.26; 95%CI: 1.16-1.59) or low CD4 cell counts (HR [95% CI] compared to > or = 200 cells/mm3: 1.62 [1.28-2.06] and 1.29 [1.07-1.56] for < 50 and 50-199 cells/mm(3), respectively). Other factors, including adherence, previous hospitalization, gender and injection drug use remained predictive of hospitalization.

Group I was divided to two subgroups for evaluation of the maternal antibody sera (6 months-2 years and over 2 years). Serum IgG anti-HAV, anti-HBc, and anti-HEV were tested by commercial ELISA kits. The data were studied by multivariant analysis. In all subjects, seroprevalence of hepatitis A, B, and E were determined as 29, 15.9, and 2.1% respectively. The prevalence of hepatitis A increased with age (p < 0.05; Group 1 15.1% and Group 3 49.6%). Anti-HBc IgG level did not significantly change with age (Group 1 18.6% and Group 3 15.4%; p > 0.05). The seroprevalence of hepatitis E virus infection was higher in Group 1 (3.7%) than Group 3 (0.3%; p < 0.05). In Group 1 first subgroup, between 6 month and 2 year, antibody levels were 12.2, 17.3, and 4.8% respectively, for anti-HAV IgG, anti-HBc IgG and anti-HEV IgG. Hepatitis A and B infection is a community health problem, but hepatitis E infection is low in children in Istanbul, Turkey.

From August 2004 to March 2006, 26 children were enrolled and started on a first-line HAART regimen, which was continued for 18 months. The study included a directly observed therapy phase (months 1-3) and a medication self-administration phase (months 4-18). CD4 percentage (CD4%) and HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load (PVL) were measured at baseline and at months 6, 12, and 18. At baseline, the median age was 5.5 years (range: 13 months-12 years), the median CD4% was 4, and the median PVL was 7.5x10(5) copies/ml. At 18 months, 23 (88%) children were alive and participating in the study. Of these children, 20 (87%) had a PVL <400 copies/ml and 12 (52%) had PVL < 50 copies/ml. The median CD4% increased to 23, while the median change in height-for-weight z-score was 0.64. Genotypic resistance typing in 2 children with PVL > 400 copies/ml at 18 months demonstrated mutations associated with resistance to lamivudine (M184V) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (Y181C and G190A). The virologic and immunologic outcomes achieved in this study compare favorably with those reported by other pediatric HIV treatment programs worldwide.

The parents/caregivers of 30 children (mean age = 5.21, SD = 3.18) who were HIV-infected and who were on active ART were surveyed to assess current methods of adherence assessment and educational efforts within the institution. All participants (except one) were African American and reported low monthly family incomes (M = $869.45, SD = $832.63). Assessment instruments included measures of perceived vulnerability, caregiver-reported adherence and perceived barriers, and objective measures of adherence (clinical pill count; electronic measurement). The results failed to demonstrate a significant relationship between parental perceived vulnerability, perceived barriers and adherence to antiretroviral medications. Methods of assessing adherence provided significantly discrepant estimates of adherence. Results are discussed in terms of implications for patient care and for future research in this area.

4445,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a major risk of transfusion-transmitted infection due to the pre-seroconversion window period (WP), infection with immunovariant viruses, and with occult carriage of HBV infection (OBI). Reduction of HBV residual risk depends upon developing more sensitive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) tests, adopting anti-HBc screening when appropriate, and implementing HBV nucleic acid testing (NAT), either in minipools or more efficiently in individual samples. HBV NAT combines the ability to significantly reduce the window period and to detect occult HBV carriage substantiating decades of clinical observation that HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive blood could transmit HBV. Clinical observations suggest limited transmission rate of occult HBV compared to WP. Low transmission rate might be related to low viral load observed in OBIs or to the presence of mutants associated with occult carriage. OBIs carrying detectable anti-HBs ( approximately 50%) are essentially not infectious by transfusion. However, recent data suggest that the neutralizing capacity of low anti-HBs may be inefficient when overcome by exposure to high viral load. Anti-HBc blood units without detectable anti-HBs appear moderately infectious except in immunocompromised recipients. Immunodeficient elderly and patients receiving immunosuppressive treatments may be susceptible to infection with lower infectious dose even in the presence of anti-HBs. The immune status of blood recipients should be taken into consideration when investigating ""post-transfusion"" HBV infection. Pre-transfusion testing and post-transfusion long-term follow-up of recipients, and molecular analysis of the virus infecting both donor and recipient are critical to definitively incriminate transfusion in the transmission of HBV."

This trial randomized 107 patients coinfected with HIV and HCV to receive 48 weeks of interferon alfa-2b (IFN) 3 million units three times weekly plus either a full course of ribavirin (RBV) at 800 mg/day (group A; n = 53) or 16 weeks of placebo, followed by RBV (group B; n = 54). The primary endpoint of sustained viral response (SVR) rate (undetectable HCV RNA at posttreatment week 24) was not different between groups A (11.3%) and B (5.6%; P =.32). Within group A, the SVR rate was lower in genotype 1 (2.5%) than in genotypes 2 through 4 (41.7%; P =.002). Fifty-five patients discontinued therapy prematurely, mostly because of adverse events or patient decisions. At treatment week 12, the percentage of CD4+ cells rose in group A (+4.1%; P <.001), but not in group B (-0.3%). A significant proportion (22%) of patients who were HIV viremic at baseline had undetectable HIV RNA at week 12. By week 16, the hemoglobin level decreased more in group A (-2,52 g/dL) than in group B (-1.02 g/dL; P <.001). In group A, the hemoglobin decline was steeper in patients receiving zidovudine (azidothymidine [AZT], -3.64 g/dL vs. no AZT, -2.08 g/dL), and patients receiving zidovudine had more anemia-related RBV dose reductions (AZT, 60% vs. no AZT, 16%). In conclusion, HCV therapy with IFN plus RBV is relatively safe in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV, but frequent treatment discontinuations and anemia-related RBV dose reductions contribute to a poor SVR rate. Control of HIV infection improves rather than worsens during therapy."

It is important to evaluate the significance of these antibodies, as most hemodialysis patients are candidates for kidney transplantation and have normal transaminase activities despite biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis. We prospectively assayed HCV viremia with the nested polymerase chain reaction in 61 patients on maintenance hemodialysis who had anti-HCV antibodies detectable in second generation tests (ELISA2 or RIBA2). HCV RNA was repeatedly detected in the serum of 52 (85.2%) patients. Liver biopsy, which was performed in 17 cases, revealed chronic hepatitis in 16 cases (including 2 of cirrhosis) and steatosis in one. Hypertransaminasemia was observed in only 31.3% and 30.8% of patients with chronic hepatitis and HCV viremia, respectively. Anti-HCV antibodies are frequently associated with HCV viremia, resulting usually in chronic hepatitis, although hypertransaminasemia is uncommon. HCV viremia reflects both post-transfusional and community-acquired HCV infection. These findings suggest a need for liver biopsy and antiviral treatment before kidney transplantation. The isolation of anti-HCV positive subjects in the dialysis setting should be evaluated to reduce patient-to-patient transmission of HCV."

In the present paper, the HIV risk status of pregnant Hispanic adolescents presenting for prenatal care to an inner-city municipal outpatient clinic located in New York City was assessed. The assessment consisted of a confidential structured interview. Based on known adult risk factors, adolescents were identified as being at increased risk or low risk. One-third of the 87 teenagers were identified as being at increased risk for HIV infection. Nobody reported symptoms suggestive of AIDS, had had a transfusion, or reported use of intravenous drugs or crack cocaine. Sexual risk-taking behavior was the most common factor that increased HIV risk. Sixteen adolescents were at increased risk solely because of a sexually transmitted disease and seven others reported an STD with at least one other risk factor. Although 86% of the pregnant teenagers reported the risk-taking behavior of substance use by self or partner, only four were at increased risk based on this factor alone. However, many adolescents were unaware of their partners' past substance use and sexual history and, therefore, may have underestimated their own risk. Birthplace (United States vs. foreign born) and nationality (Puerto Rican vs. non-Puerto Rican Hispanic) were significantly associated with the adolescents' HIV risk assessment via an interaction effect. None of the adolescents had previously considered themselves to be at increased risk for HIV infection. The overwhelming majority who were at increased risk declined referral for further counseling or testing. It is recommended that pregnant Hispanic adolescents be assessed for HIV risk and receive risk reduction counseling as part of their general health care."

We conducted a cross-sectional study among HIV-infected adults prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy and receiving care from nine clinics. Depression was screened using Patient Health Questionnaire 9 and facilitators of HIV medication adherence were assessed using an 11-item scale which yielded a total positive attitude to disease score. Prevalence ratios of non-adherence between different categories of potential risk factors were calculated. We compared mean 'facilitators to adherence' scores between the adherent and non-adherent population. Multivariable Poisson regression with robust variance was used to identify independent risk factors. Among the 211 respondents, nearly 20% were non-adherent, approximately 8% had either moderately severe or severe depression and mean score for combined facilitators to medication adherence was 33.35 (±7.88) out of a possible 44 points. Factors significantly associated with non-adherence included older age, female sex worker, moderate-to-severe depression and the combined facilitators to medication adherence score. These data from a broad range of clinical settings in Hyderabad reveal that key groups to focus on for adherence intervention are female sex workers, older persons and those with depression."

However, the need for optimal adherence has been recognized. We implemented a pilot community-based program of directly observed therapy (DOT) with HAART among persons with substance use disorders and a history of failure of HAART. A near-peer outreach worker initially delivered and observed once-daily HAART doses on up to 7 days per week. Many participants tapered the frequency of visits. Participants were assessed by a brief questionnaire and determination of their CD4+ cell count and plasma HIV load. Twenty-five HIV-seropositive persons were enrolled and followed-up for a mean of 6.6 months (standard deviation, 3.9 months). We found that once-daily dosing of HAART by DOT is feasible in this population; in addition to observation of the majority of doses, most participants achieved virus suppression and felt favorably about the intervention. Tapering the intensity of visits with maximum flexibility was necessary to enhance the acceptability of the program to participants."

Understanding the HIV care and treatment engagement experiences of FSW has important implications for interventions to enhance care and treatment outcomes. We conducted a systematic review to examine the HIV care experiences and determinants of linkage and retention in care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, and ART adherence and viral suppression among FSW living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. The databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, SCOPUS, CINAHL, Global Health, Psycinfo, Sociological Abstracts, and Popline were searched for variations of search terms related to sex work and HIV care and treatment among sub-Saharan African populations. Ten peer-reviewed articles published between January 2000 and August 2015 met inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Despite expanded ART access, FSW in sub-Saharan Africa have sub-optimal HIV care and treatment engagement outcomes. Stigma, discrimination, poor nutrition, food insecurity, and substance use were commonly reported and associated with poor linkage to care, retention in care, and ART initiation. Included studies suggest that interventions with FSW should focus on multilevel barriers to engagement in HIV care and treatment and explore the involvement of social support from intimate male partners. Our results emphasise several critical points of intervention for FSW living with HIV, which are urgently needed to enhance linkage to HIV care, retention in care, and treatment initiation, particularly where the HIV prevalence among FSW is greatest."

The HIV-2 reverse transcriptase (RT) gene from 25 HIV-2-infected patients followed-up in Marseilles and the surrounding area was analyzed. The aims of this study were to characterize the polymorphism of HIV-2 RT in the absence of drug, to determine whether it naturally harbors codons associated with drug-resistance in HIV-1, and to identify mutations emerging under NRTI-selective pressure. Fourteen patients had never undergone antiretroviral therapy and 11 received NRTI. Seventy sequences were analyzed. In untreated patients, 12 spots of high natural polymorphism (at positions 10, 11, 20, 43, 104, 121, 135, 162, 176, 180, 200, and 227) were observed; 4 of them were specific of HIV-2 (10, 176, 180, 227). Moreover, results showed four positions that could be associated with natural resistance to NRTI (75I, 118I, 219E, and perhaps 215S), in addition to those described previously for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (181I, 188L, 190A). In HIV-2-infected patients receiving NRTI-containing therapies, specific genotypic patterns were observed with a high frequency of mutation Q151M (in 45% of patients) often associated with 70R, 115F, 214L, and/or 223R, which might compose an HIV-2 multi-NRTI resistance complex. Four newly or rarely described NRTI-selected mutations were observed: I5V, K35R, F214L, and K223R. As in HIV-1, substitution M184V was found in 3TC-treated patients. In conclusion, these findings highlight the need for specific guidelines for determining genotypic resistance and treatment of HIV-2."
2041,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"A variety of factors can contribute to the failure of combination antiretroviral therapy to durably suppress viral replication in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Patients who have a low CD4(+) T cell count or high plasma viral load before therapy is initiated are at high risk for subsequent virological failure. Previous therapy is also a strong determinant of subsequent virological response, presumably because of pre-existing viral resistance. Drug exposure, as determined by adherence, drug absorption, and drug metabolism, has a significant impact on future long-term virological responses. Although definitive proof is lacking, some tissues may have limited drug penetration, thus allowing for ongoing viral replication. Understanding why combination therapy fails for HIV-infected patients may allow clinicians to individualize treatment strategies. Unfortunately, almost any factor (drug, host, or viral) that leads to virological failure of an initial combination regimen is likely to persist-and perhaps become more challenging-once a salvage regimen is initiated."

We explored factors associated with sustained virologic suppression in an urban clinic population. The study population was drawn from patients who enrolled in Montefiore Medical Center's Infectious Diseases Clinic from 1999 to 2000. A computerized query of the hospital information system generated a list of potential case patients having every HIV- 1 viral load (VL) less than 50 copies per milliliter throughout 2002 (at least three VL measurements were required), and a list of potential controls who failed to demonstrate sustained virologic suppression during 2002. Demographic and clinical information were collected by chart review, and case and control patient characteristics were compared by both univariate and multivariate analyses. Sixty-four case patients were compared to 64 controls. There were no significant differences in age, gender, ethnicity, type of antiretroviral therapy, or frequency of clinic visits. During the year of the study, cases experienced a significantly greater rise in CD4(+) lymphocyte counts than controls (108 cells per microliter versus 27 cells per microliter). On univariate analysis, factors associated with sustained virologic suppression included risk behavior other than heterosexual contact or injection drug use, being a non-smoker, and hepatitis C seropositivity. On logistic regression analysis, factors independently associated with sustained virologic suppression were risk behavior other than heterosexual contact or injection drug use (IDU), and hepatitis C seropositivity. In this study sample, being a nonsmoker, having a risk behavior for HIV acquisition other than heterosexual contact or IDU, and being seropositive for hepatitis C were associated with sustained virologic suppression. Computerized query of the hospital information system proved to be a powerful tool for the identification of study patients in a real-world clinic environment."

One hundred sixty-six asymptomatic HIV+ subjects, 63 neurologically symptomatic HIV+ subjects, and six at-risk HIV-1-seronegative (HIV-) control subjects underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis on entry into this longitudinal study. Three (1.8%) of the asymptomatic HIV+ subjects had both a reactive CSF VDRL test and a reactive CSF fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (FTA-ABS) test. Two of these three subjects had a history of appropriately treated early syphilis, and all had a reactive serum rapid plasma reagin test. Of the 63 neurologically symptomatic HIV+ subjects, one patient with dementia had both a reactive CSF VDRL test and a fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test. Subjective improvement in cognitive skills followed high-dose, intravenous penicillin therapy. Another subject had a penicillin-responsive myelopathy accompanied by a reactive CSF fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test result, but a nonreactive CSF VDRL. Unsuspected neurosyphilis is relatively common in our population of asymptomatic HIV+ subjects and may be responsible for neurological disease in a significant minority of neurologically symptomatic HIV+ persons. Cerebrospinal fluid examination should be performed in all HIV+ persons with a history of syphilis or serological evidence of syphilis, regardless of prior treatment. Additionally, neurosyphilis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neurological disease in any HIV+ person."

We sought to identify social or clinical factors amenable to intervention that predict virological outcomes after 12 months of ART. We examined a retrospective cohort of consecutive adults initiating free nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens. Individuals remaining in care 12 months post-ART initiation were tested for HIV viral load and surveyed to identify barriers and facilitators to adherence, and to determine clinic travel times and associated costs. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression identified factors predicting HIV viral load >200 copies/mL after 12 months of ART. Of 230 adults initiating ART, 10% of patients died, 8% transferred out, 5% were lost to follow-up, and 174/230 (76%) completed 12 months of ART, the questionnaire, and viral load testing. HIV viral load was <200 copies/mL in 140/174 (80%) patients. In multivariate models, being busy with work or caring for others (OR 2.9, p < 0.01), having clinic transport times ≥ 3 hours (OR 3.0, p = 0.02), and alcohol use (OR 4.8, p = 0.03) predicted viral load >200 copies/mL after 12 months of ART. Clinical outcomes following ART are related to programmatic factors such as prolonged travel time and individual factors such as being busy with family or using alcohol. Simple interventions that alter these factors should be evaluated to improve clinical outcomes for populations receiving free ART in similar settings. "

We evaluated 1636 HIV+ and 683 HIV- women, with a hypertension prevalence of 40% and 38%, respectively; diabetes prevalence of 21% and 22%; and smoking prevalence of 37% and 48%. Hypertension treatment was higher among HIV+ than HIV- women (77% vs. 67%, p < 0.001) and increased over time with no difference in trend by HIV status. Hypertension control was greater among HIV+ women (56% vs. 43%, p < 0.001) and increased over time among HIV+ but not HIV- women. Diabetes treatment was similar among HIV+ and HIV- women (48% vs. 49%) and increased over time in both groups. Diabetes control was greater among HIV+ women (73% vs. 64%, p = 0.03) and did not change over time. The percent of recent smokers who reported no longer smoking was similar between HIV+ and HIV- women (10% vs. 9%), with no differences over time.

An assay of anti-HCV antibodies was performed using both first- and second-generation immunoenzymatic tests, and anti-HCV specificity was confirmed with a second-generation recombinant immunoblot assay. Of 548 hemodialysis patients, 90 (16.4%) were positive with first-generation, and 166 (30.3%) with second-generation tests. These rates were significantly higher than those for either hospital staff members (0.5% and 2.3%; p < 0.01) or healthy blood donors (0.98% and 1.30%; p < 0.001). Patients with a history of blood transfusion tended to have a higher positivity rate for anti-HCV than did the non-transfused group (35.4% vs. 25.7% with second generation tests; p < 0.05). Positivity for anti-HCV was related to the duration of hemodialysis. Only a few patients seroconverted during the 2-year, 5-month period between the previous and present studies. Although hemodialysis patients remain a high-risk group for HCV infection, the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies has decreased recently thanks to the use of erythropoietin for renal anemia, the universal screening of blood donors for anti-HCV antibodies, and improvements in infection control measures for this virus."

A greater degree of histocompatibility match between these donors and their HCV-negative recipients was associated with a greater predisposition to recipient HCV liver disease (ALT elevation) posttransplant. The HCV carrier state could be identified with significant amplification of autologous mixed lymphocyte reactivity (AMLR) in both long-term hemodialysis and long-term renal transplant patients, but the AMLR was absent in end-stage liver disease patients with HCV-associated cirrhosis and was insignificantly elevated in these patients with persistent infection in the first 2 years after a new liver was transplanted. There was also a moderate reduction in autologous reactivity as well as serum HCV titers among renal transplant patients who displayed biochemical evidence of chronic liver disease as opposed to those who did not. This appeared later in the course of the disease. HCV RNA could be detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of only a portion of HCV-infected renal transplant patients and these showed significantly higher autologous reactivity. In contrast, despite the fact that observations were earlier after de novo liver transplantation, HCV RNA (i.e., earlier in the course of a new or recurrent disease process) was found in PBMC of all liver transplant recipients tested. The AMLR of noninfected laboratory volunteers could be amplified by preincubating their stimulating cells (APCs) with enriched HCV possibly in immune complex (pHCV-IC). This amplification appeared only with specific combinations of HCV strains with HLA DR serotypes. In addition, HCV-primed T cells could be generated to the virus which displayed accelerated activation kinetics. Liver infiltrating lymphocytes extracted from HCV-positive end-stage diseased livers had significantly higher proliferative and cytotoxic reactivity to autologous (HCV-infected) hepatocytes than the extracted lymphocytes responding to autologous hepatocytes from HCV-negative livers. These findings offer evidence of dynamic autoimmune mechanisms in the spectrum of progression of HCV disease and may help to predict the effect of intervention at various intervals in this progression in organ transplant recipients."

However, chronic pain, depression, and substance use, all of which are prevalent in this population, can reduce the quality of patient-provider engagement. We hypothesized a model in which chronic pain, depression, and substance use would be associated with poorer patient-provider engagement, which would be positively associated with adherence, with the latter associated positively with viral suppression. We analyzed data from the BEACON study, which included surveys from 383 PLHIV who were primarily African American, on ART, and had histories of drug use. Due to six missing cases on the chronic pain variable, we used data from 377 respondents in a structural equation model. Chronic pain and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with poorer patient-provider engagement, while substance use was associated with better engagement. Patient-provider engagement in turn was associated with better ART adherence, which was associated with higher viral suppression. Results suggest the role of chronic pain in poor patient-physician engagement in this population, which has potential implications for quality of HIV patient care and health outcomes. Findings suggest the need for attention to patient-provider engagement in PLHIV."

During September 2008-February 2012, retrospective cohort studies to estimate attrition of enrollees (i.e., from death, stopping ART, or loss to follow-up) at 6-month intervals after ART initiation were completed among samples of adult men and women (defined as aged ≥15 years or aged ≥18 years) who initiated ART during 2004-2010 in six African countries: Côte d'Ivoire in western Africa; Swaziland, Mozambique, and Zambia in southern Africa; and Uganda and Tanzania in eastern Africa. Records for 13,175 ART enrollees were analyzed; sample sizes among the six countries ranged from 1,457 to 3,682. In each country, women comprised 61%-67% of ART enrollees. Median CD4 count range was 119-141 cells/µL for men and 137-161 cells/µL for women. Compared with women, a greater percentage of men initiated ART who had World Health Organization (WHO) HIV stage IV disease. In cohorts from western Africa and southern Africa, the risk for attrition was 15%-26% lower among women compared with men in multivariable analysis. However, in eastern Africa, differences between men and women in risk for attrition were not statistically significant. Research to identify country-specific causes for increased attrition and delayed initiation of care among men could identify strategies to improve ART program outcomes among men, which might contribute to prevention of new HIV infections in female partners.

A sample of 851 out-of-treatment IDUs was recruited in Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, between 2003 and 2005. Participants were tested for HIV and HCV antibodies. Demographic, drug use, and injection practice data were collected via interviews. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analysis. Participants had a mean age of 40 years and 74% are male, 63% are African American, 29% are non-Hispanic white, and 8% are of other race/ethnicity. Overall, 42% of participants had ever used an HDSS and 12% had shared one. HIV prevalence was 5% among IDUs who had never used an HDSS compared with 16% among IDUs who had shared one. The HIV model used a propensity score approach to adjust for differences between IDUs who had used an HDSS and those who had never used one. The HCV models included all potential confounders as covariates. A history of sharing HDSSs was associated with prevalent HIV (odds ratio=2.50; 95% confidence interval=1.01, 6.15). Use and sharing of HDSSs were also associated with increased odds of HCV infection. Prospective studies are needed to determine if sharing HDSSs is associated with increased HIV and HCV incidence among IDUs."

In this study we characterized plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen levels, markers of fibrinolysis and increased CVD risk, in HIV lipodystrophic patients compared to controls. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of treatment with metformin on PAI-1 and tPA antigen levels in patients with HIV-associated fat redistribution. Eighty-six patients (age 43 +/- 1 yr, BMI 26.1 +/- 0.5 kg/m(2)) with HIV and fat redistribution were compared to 258 age- and BMI-matched subjects from the Framingham Offspring study. In addition, 25 HIV-infected patients with fat redistribution and fasting insulin >15 microU/mL [104 pmol/L] or impaired glucose tolerance, but without diabetes mellitus were enrolled in a placebo-controlled treatment study of metformin 500 mg twice daily. PAI-1 and tPA antigen levels were significantly increased in patients with HIV related fat redistribution compared to Framingham control subjects (46.1 +/- 4 vs 18.9 +/- 0.9 microg/L PAI-1, 16.6 +/- 0.8 vs. 8.0 +/- 0.3 microg/L tPA, P = 0.0001). Among patients with HIV infection, a multivariate regression analysis including age, sex, waist-to-hip ratio, BMI, smoking status, protease inhibitor use and insulin area under the curve (AUC), found gender and insulin AUC were significant predictors of tPA antigen. Twelve weeks of metformin treatment resulted in decreased tPA antigen levels (-1.9 +/- 1.4 vs +1.4 +/- 1.0 microg/L in the placebo-treated group P = 0.02). Similarly, metformin resulted in improvement in PAI-1 levels (-8.7 +/- 2.3 vs +1.7 +/- 2.9 microg/L, P = 0.03). Change in insulin AUC correlated significantly with change in tPA antigen (r = 0.43, P = 0.03). PAI-1 and tPA antigen, markers of impaired fibrinolysis and increased CVD risk, are increased in association with hyperinsulinemia in patients with HIV and fat redistribution. Metformin reduces PAI-1 and tPA antigen concentrations in these patients and may ultimately improve associated CVD risk."

As they have overlapping distribution in tropical areas, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, any of their clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic interactions might have important effects on patient care and public health policy. The biological basis of these interactions is well established. HIV infection induces cellular depletion and early abnormalities of CD4+ T cells, decreases CD8+ T-cell counts and function (cellular immunity), causes deterioration of specific antigen responses (humoral immunity), and leads to alteration of innate immunity through impairment of cytolytic activity and cytokine production by natural killer cells. Therefore, HIV infection affects the immune response to malaria, particularly premunition in adolescents and adults, and pregnancy-specific immunity, leading to different patterns of disease in HIV-infected patients compared with HIV-uninfected patients. In this systematic review, we collate data on the effects of HIV on malaria and discuss their therapeutic consequences. HIV infection is associated with increased prevalence and severity of clinical malaria and impaired response to antimalarial treatment, depending on age, immunodepression, and previous immunity to malaria. HIV also affects pregnancy-specific immunity to malaria and response to intermittent preventive treatment. Co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) prophylaxis and antiretroviral treatment reduce occurrence of clinical malaria; however, these therapies interact with antimalarial drugs, and new therapeutic guidelines are needed for concomitant use."

Therefore, a representative sample of 1687 HIV-infected patients was studied; a 213-sample subcohort was selected by use of risk-based sampling from 2 large prospective US Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group clinical trials. HCV prevalence, HCV RNA level, and genotype were determined. The weighted overall estimate of HCV prevalence in the study cohort was 16.1% (95% weighted confidence interval, 14.3%-17.8%), with significant variability depending on risk factors and HIV RNA levels. Among patients defined as being ""at risk"", 72.7% were HCV positive, whereas, among low-risk patients, the positivity rate was 3.5%. Genotype 1 was found in 83.3% of infected patients. Median HCV RNA level was 6.08x106 IU/mL. High virus loads and genotype 1 prevalence may be important to interferon-based antiviral response rates among coinfected patients."

Serum samples were screened for HSV-2 antibodies using an indirect ELISA. Eighty-three patients were men (mean age: 38.8) and 67 were women (mean age: 35.4). The estimated prevalence of HSV-2 was 52% (95% CI: 44-60%) and it was higher among men (53%) than among women (50.7%). Overall, the age of first sexual intercourse and past history of genital herpes were associated with HSV-2 seropositivity. Analysis by gender disclosed significant association of number of lifetime sex partners only among men. Although HSV-2 antibodies were frequent in the study group, genital herpes was reported by 21.8% of the HSV-2 positive subjects, indicating low awareness of the HSV-2 infection. These results may have public health importance for Brazil as the high rate of HSV-2 infection may act as a cofactor of HIV transmission."

Data on age, sex, weight variation, smoking status, duration of HIV infection, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention disease stage, CD4 cell count, HIV RNA load, lipodystrophy, HIV-hepatitis C virus coinfection, and antiretroviral treatment (type of drugs and total cumulative dose) were collected. The prevalence study included 350 HIV-infected patients. Sixteen percent of patients had hypothyroidism: 2.6% had overt hypothyroidism, 6.6% had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 6.8% had a low free T4 level. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism was higher among HIV-infected men than among HIV-infected women. A case-control study was conducted that compared hypothyroid (n=56) and euthyroid (n=287) patients. In the multivariate analysis, receipt of stavudine and low CD4 cell count were associated with hypothyroidism. Therefore, screening may be indicated for patients, especially men, who have received stavudine or have decreased CD4 cell counts."

Our aim was to analyze early viral and immune dynamics after interruption of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and to determine whether thymic function-related markers play a role in preventing CD4 count decline caused by increased viral replication. This was a prospective study of an open cohort of 47 HIV-infected patients with a median 969 CD4 count and prolonged viral suppression. They were followed every 4 weeks though week 24. Thymic volume and TREC level were analyzed at baseline. Increased thymic volume was associated with higher plasma viral load and greater CD4 count decline early after interruption. Three virologic patterns were observed: rapid/high (RH), delayed/high (DH), and low/slow (LS) viral replication. RH correlated with higher thymic volume at baseline and with higher CD4 count decline at week 4. Patients with greater thymic volume was associated with an immune and virologic impairment only early after interruption, probably because of infection of the increased number of available target cells. As the long-term consequences of these observations are unknown, the safety of treatment interruption must be further studied."

We performed an observational cohort analysis of antiretroviral-experienced or -naive HIV-infected patients prescribed a new HAART regimen (3538 patients) and enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California from 1997 through 2002. Outcomes evaluated were HAART adherence and changes in HIV RNA level and CD4 T-cell counts over 12 and 24 months. The antiretroviral-naive group had a significantly greater odds of achieving >/=95% adherence to the HAART regimen over 12 months (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.88, p < 0.001) and over 24 months (OR = 1.66, p < 0.001). The odds of achieving HIV RNA levels below limits of quantification also was higher among patients who were antiretroviral naive; over 24 months OR = 6.88, p < 0.001. Adjusted change in CD4 T-cell count was also greater among naive patients over 24 months (+67 cells/muL, p < 0.001), compared to antiretroviral-experienced patients. Years of antiretroviral experience did not affect adherence or any outcome measure. Adjusting for HAART adherence did not significantly affect HIV RNA results but did lessen CD4 T-cell count differences between antiretroviral-naive and -experienced patients. Thus, antiretroviral naive patients have improved HAART adherence, HIV RNA control, and CD4 T-cell count increases compared to antiretroviral-experienced patients regardless of years of antiretroviral experience. These findings should help direct HAART adherence efforts in HIV care clinics."

However, people on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are experiencing new challenges such as metabolic and morphological body changes, which may affect self-perceived body image. The concept of body image is complex and encompasses an individual's perception of their existential self, physical self and social interpretation of their body by others. The Longitudinal Investigations into Supportive and Ancillary Health Services (LISA) cohort is a prospective study of HIV-positive persons on ART. An interviewer-administered survey collects socio-demographic and health information including body image, stigma, depression, food insecurity, and quality of life (QoL). In bivariate analyses, Chi-squared or Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare individuals reporting positive body image with those reporting negative body image. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine associations between negative body image and covariates. Of 451 LISA participants, 47% reported negative body image. The adjusted multivariate analysis showed participants who reported high stigma in the presence of depressive symptoms were more likely to have negative body image compared to people reporting low stigma and no depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.41, confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-4.68). The estimated probability of a person having positive body image without stigma or depression was 68%. When stigma alone was included, the probability dropped to 59%, and when depression was included alone the probability dropped to 34%. Depressive symptoms and high stigma combined resulted in a probability of reporting positive body image of 27%. Further efforts are needed to address body image among people living with HIV. In order to lessen the impacts of depression on body image, such issues must be addressed in health care settings. Community interventions are also needed to address stigma and negative body image to improve the lives of people living with HIV."

For 562 IDUs (265 anti-HIV negative, 297 anti-HIV positive), we analyzed liver function, anti-HIV antibody, anti-HCV antibody, HCV viral loads, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). HIV RNA viral loads and CD4 cell count for anti-HIV-seropositive IDUs and the HCV genotype for HCV RNA-seropositive IDUs were measured. The seroprevalence rates of anti-HIV, anti-HCV, and HBsAg were 52.8%, 91.3%, and 15.3%, respectively. All the anti-HIV-seropositive IDUs were positive for HIV RNA. Anti-HCV seropositivity was the most important factor associated with HIV infection (odds ratio [OR], 25.06; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 8.97-74.9), followed by male gender (OR, 6.12; 95% CI, 4.05-9.39) and HBsAg seropositivity (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.11-3.34). Among IDUs positive for anti-HCV, 80.7% had detectable HCV RNA. HCV viremia after HCV exposure was strongly related to HIV infection (OR, 6.262; 95% CI, 1.515-18.28), but negatively correlated to HBsAg seropositivity (OR, 0.161; 95% CI, 0.082-0.317). HCV genotype 6 was the most prevalent genotype among all IDUs (41.0%), followed by genotypes 1 (32.3%), 3 (12.8%), and 2 (5.6%). In conclusion, about half IDUs were infected with HIV and >90% with HCV infection. Male and seropositivity for HBsAg and anti-HCV were factors related to HIV infection among our IDUs. HIV was positively correlated, whereas hepatitis B co-infection was negatively correlated with HCV viremia among IDUs with HCV exposure. Different HCV molecular epidemiology was noted among IDUs."

The association between adherence and resistance to NNRTI-based regimens is poorly understood. Predictors of virologic failure and resistance according to a baseline evaluation of nonadherence risk factors were determined in a cohort of 71 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with early virologic response who received an NNRTI-based regimen. During the median follow-up of 29 months, 20 (28%) of 71 patients experienced virologic failure with an NNRTI-based regimen. Virologic failure was associated with repeated drug holidays (> or =48 h of unplanned drug cessation), depression, younger age, and low adherence to therapy during baseline evaluation. Moreover, repeated drug holidays was the only risk factor for developing a major mutation conferring cross-resistance to the NNRTI class (hazard ratio, 22.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.8-180.3; P<.0001). Patients' previous adherence to therapy and drugs genetic barriers, not only the number of pills or doses involved, should be taken into consideration in the decision to simplify highly active antiretroviral therapy."

Given the dearth of longitudinal research into ART adherence dynamics, we sought to identify factors associated with transitioning into and out of optimal adherence to ART in a longitudinal study of HIV-infected people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) in a setting of universal no-cost HIV/AIDS treatment. Using data from a prospective cohort of community-recruited HIV-positive illicit drug users confidentially linked to comprehensive HIV/AIDS treatment records, we estimated longitudinal factors associated with losing or gaining ≥95% adherence in the previous six months using two generalized linear mixed-effects models. Among 703 HIV-infected ART-exposed PWUD, becoming non-adherent was associated with periods of homelessness (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.52, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.56-4.07), active injection drug use (AOR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.01-1.56) and incarceration (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.10-2.17). Periods of sex work (AOR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.34-0.75) and injection drug use (AOR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.50-0.77) were barriers to becoming optimally adherent. Methadone maintenance therapy was associated with becoming optimally adherent (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.50-2.33) and was protective against becoming non-adherent (AOR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.41-0.65). In conclusion, we identified several behavioural, social and structural factors that shape adherence patterns among PWUD. Our findings highlight the need to consider these contextual factors in interventions that support the effective delivery of ART to this population. "

A murine model of lipodystrophy is associated with decreased levels of adiponectin, an adipocyte-secreted protein, the administration of which improves the metabolic syndrome in these mice. To investigate the association of adiponectin with metabolic changes in human lipodystrophy, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 112 HIV-infected patients treated with HAART. Mean adiponectin levels were higher in patients with no fat redistribution (FR) vs. FR (4.8 +/- 5.0 vs. 2.2 +/- 2.7 microg/ml, P < 0.01), but no significant differences in adiponectin levels were observed between FR subgroups. The difference in adiponectin levels between subjects with and without FR remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, leptin, HIV medication use, and CD4 count using logistic regression (odds ratio, 0.54, P = 0.008). Adiponectin was significantly correlated with triglycerides (r = -0.40), abdominal visceral fat (r = -0.35), extremity fat (r = 0.37), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (r = -0.28), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) use (r = -0.32), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (r = 0.41) using bivariate analysis (all P < 0.01). The association with HDL weakened but remained significant on multivariate analysis (standard beta = 0.29, P = 0.01). However, the association of adiponectin with HOMA-IR became nonsignificant after adjusting for NRTI use (standard beta = -0.15, P = 0.12), suggesting that changes in adiponectin levels may underlie the effect of NRTI use on insulin resistance. The associations of adiponectin with triglycerides and HOMA-IR were also slightly weakened after adjusting for visceral and extremity fat, indicating that adiponectin may, in part, mediate the effect of FR on triglycerides and insulin resistance. This study indicates that adiponectin is inversely correlated with abdominal visceral fat mass, serum triglycerides, and insulin resistance and is directly correlated with HDL and extremity fat in a sample of HIV-infected patients treated with HAART. The results also indicate that NRTI use may worsen insulin resistance by decreasing adiponectin levels. Thus, adiponectin replacement may be a potential treatment option to ameliorate the metabolic changes observed in this patient population."

Given the potential for coadministration in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, possible drug interactions with antiretroviral drugs must be carefully considered. Four phase 1, multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in healthy volunteers (n = 66). The 3D regimen of 150/100 mg daily paritaprevir/ritonavir, 25 mg daily ombitasvir, and 400 mg twice-daily dasabuvir was administered alone or in combination with 200 mg daily of emtricitabine and 300 mg daily of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF), 25 mg daily of rilpivirine, or 400 mg of raltegravir twice daily. A 2-DAA regimen of 150/100 mg daily paritaprevir/ritonavir and 400 mg of dasabuvir twice daily was also studied in combination with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF at 600/200/300 mg daily, respectively (Atripla; Bristol-Myers Squibb). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from plasma drug concentrations. No clinically significant drug interactions were observed (≤32% change in exposure) between the 3D regimen and that of emtricitabine plus tenofovir DF. Raltegravir exposure was increased up to 134% when the drug was coadministered with the 3D regimen. Although coadministration with rilpivirine was well tolerated in healthy volunteers, observed elevations in rilpivirine exposures may increase the potential for adverse drug reactions. Concomitant use of the 2-DAA regimen and efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF was discontinued owing to poor tolerability and adverse events. No dose adjustment is required during coadministration of raltegravir, tenofovir DF, or emtricitabine with the 3D regimen. Rilpivirine is not recommended and efavirenz is contraindicated for coadministration with the 3D regimen."

We performed chart review of all intensive care unit admissions for HIV-infected patients at San Francisco General Hospital from 1996 through 1999. There were an average of 88.5 admissions per year with 71% survival to hospital discharge. Univariate analysis demonstrated that prior highly active antiretroviral therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8, p = 0.04), a non-AIDS-associated admission diagnosis (OR = 3.7, p = 0.001), a lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (OR = 5.4, p = 0.001), and higher serum albumin (OR = 4.4, p = 0.001) predicted improved survival.

In multivariate logistic regression, all variables except prior use of highly active antiretroviral therapy and pneumothorax were significant independent predictors of outcome. At our institution, overall survival for HIV-infected intensive care unit patients has improved, especially among patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. These patients may have an improved survival because of effects of therapy on variables such as likelihood of non-AIDS-associated admission diagnoses and serum albumin levels."

Currently, only limited prevalence data for HHV-8 infection in HIV-infected children living in non-endemic areas are available. This multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted in four university hospitals in Germany specializing in pediatric HIV care. Stored serum specimens obtained from 207 vertically HIV-1-infected children and adolescents were tested for antibodies against lytic and latent HHV-8 antigens. Logistic regression was used to assess independent risk factors associated with HHV-8 seropositivity. The overall HHV-8 seroprevalence was 24.6 % (n = 51/207) without significant differences related to sex, age, or ethnicity. In univariate analysis, HHV-8 seropositivity was significantly associated with a child having being born outside Germany, maternal origin from sub-Saharan Africa, a history of breastfeeding, CDC immunologic category 3, and deferred initiation of antiretroviral therapy (>24 months of age). In multivariate analysis, a child's birth outside Germany was the only significant risk factor for HHV-8 seropositivity (odds ratio 3.98; 95 % confidence interval 1.27-12.42). HHV-8-associated malignancies were uncommon; only one patient had a history of KS. Serum specimen of vertically HIV-infected children and adolescents living in Germany showed a high HHV-8 seroprevalence. These findings suggest that primary HHV-8 infection-a risk factor for KS and other HHV-8-associated malignancies-occurs early in life. Thus, management of perinatally HIV-infected children should include testing for HHV-8 coinfection and should consider future risks of HHV-8-associated malignancies. "

To assess the correlation between adherence and virologic outcome, the PMAQ-V1.0 was administered to 194 antiretroviral-experienced adults with HIV infection enrolled in a 16-week evaluation of protease inhibitor-containing regimens featuring a lamivudine/zidovudine combination tablet. At baseline, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were less than 10,000 copies/mL and CD4(+)-cell counts were equal to or greater than 300 x 10(6)/L; patients had been receiving a conventional regimen of lamivudine + zidovudine (separately) plus a protease inhibitor for at least 10 weeks immediately prior to the study. Forty-eight percent of patients who reported missing at least one dose of a nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) during the study had detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA, compared with 26% of patients who reported no missed doses (P = .002). Patients who missed at least one dose of an NRTI or protease inhibitor were 2.5 times more likely to have quantifiable HIV-1 RNA than those who reported no missed doses. Patients who reported fewer barriers and more motivators to adherence had better virologic outcomes (P = .001). Several dimensions of the PMAQ-V1.0 did not function as well as hypothesized. In this study, self-reported adherence derived from the PMAQ-V1.0 predicted virologic outcomes, but further refinement of the dimensions appears warranted."

The purpose of this study was to: (1) describe adherence prevalence among patients receiving free ARV in south central China; (2) identify factors associated with adherence; (3) compare 3 self-report measures of adherence in this population. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at seven free treatment sites in Hunan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces. Adherence measures included direct questioning regarding the number of doses taken in the 7 days prior to interview, the Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA) Adherence Self-Report questionnaire, and a 7-day visual analogue scale. Subjects comprised all patients returning for monthly ARV follow-up at each site between April and July 2006. Among the 308 subjects, 244 (79%) lived in the countryside. One hundred seventy (55%) had been on ARV over 1 year. No regimen included a protease inhibitor. Two hundred forty-four (80%) reported taking more than 90% of prescribed doses in the previous 7 days. Sixty-four (20%) subjects reported missing at least 1 dose in that period. The three measures of self-reported adherence were highly correlated. On multivariate analysis, current heroin use (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1,6, p = 0.05) and nonuse of reminders such as cell phone alarms, wall charts, or TV programs (OR 6; 95% CI 3, 11; p = 0.001) were associated with 90% or less adherence. Adherence to ARV in Central China is similar to elsewhere in the world. The 20% of subjects who reported taking 90% or fewer doses are of concern in view of the potential for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance and lack of protease inhibitor back-up regimens.

Patients (N = 1039) were randomized as part of a larger, multisite clinical trial sponsored by the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network assessing liver function. HCV status was first assessed with an antibody screen; if positive, then current infection was determined with an antigen screen testing for detectable virus. Patients were classified as HCV negative, HCV positive but have cleared the virus, or as having chronic HCV. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine demographic and behavioral correlates of the three groups. Thirty-four percent of patients were classified with chronic infection and 14% had evidence of prior infection with apparent clearing of the virus. Chronic infection was associated with recent injection drug use and cocaine use. Chronic HCV infection was also associated with being older and Hispanic. Age, ethnicity, and current drug use increase the likelihood of being chronically infected with HCV. Strategies targeting high risk subgroups can aid in preventing further disease escalation."

Independent correlates of HIV testing included younger age, felony criminal history, stronger therapeutic alliance with one's primary clinician, and increased drug problems and psychological distress. Of those tested, nearly all (96.5%) reported receiving the test results; however, only half (50.5%) reported receiving any posttest counseling. Independent correlates of posttest counseling included higher educational level, felony criminal history, and receipt of community-based case management services.

At follow-up, 21% of men and 44% of women reported unprotected sex (p = 0.005), and female gender (OR = 4.42, 95% CI = 1.79-10.94) and hazardous drinking (compared with not meeting criteria for hazardous drinking, OR = 3.64, 95% CI = 1.34-9.86) were associated with unprotected sex, adjusting for race and homelessness. In this population with a high prevalence of HIV, we demonstrated persistent engagement in sexual risk behavior during the postrelease period. Enhanced efforts to promote sexual health and reduced risk behavior among both male and female current and former prison inmates are needed, including improved access to preventive care and HIV and STI screening, testing, and treatment."

Overall, the prevalence of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in these men was 38.0%. The factor most strongly associated with prevalent HIV infection according to a multiple logistic regression model was rectal trauma, a composite variable which included receptive anal fisting, enemas before sex, reporting of blood around the rectum, and the observation of scarring, fissures or fistulas on rectal examination. Receptive anal intercourse also was strongly associated with HIV infection in the model. The multivariate relative odds for HIV antibody positivity was 7.72 for the highest level of rectal trauma and 3.04 for receptive anal intercourse. Symptoms reported to occur in some persons who subsequently develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were frequent among HIV seropositive men (12.9%) but were reported in 8.4% of seronegative men as well. Generalized lymphadenopathy was observed significantly more often in seropositive men (48.8%) compared with seronegative men (11.4%). The prevalence of HIV antibodies was inversely related to the number of T-helper cells and directly related (to a lesser extent) to the number of T-suppressor cells. The results suggest that disruption of the rectal mucosa provides access by HIV to the blood stream and to specific immunologic cells. Since symptoms and generalized lymphadenopathy were often reported among seronegative men, they probably also occur among some seropositive men not currently progressing to AIDS."

In recent years, apart from the traditional transmission route of intravenous drug abuse, outbreaks of sexually transmitted acute HCV infections, mainly among HIV-positive men who have sex with men, have contributed to the overall disease burden. - Because the natural course of HCV infection is substantially accelerated in HIV-co-infection, end-stage liver disease has become the most frequent cause of non-AIDS related death in this population. Therefore every HIV/HCV co-infected patient should be evaluated for possible anti-HCV therapy with the goal of reaching a sustained virological response and thus cure of hepatitis C infection. The standard of care for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in HIV-infected remains a pegylated interferon in combination with weight-adapted ribavirin. - HAART should not be withheld from HCV co-infected patients due to concerns of drug related hepatotoxicity and in patients with reduced CD4-cell counts HAART should be started first. Under pegylated interferon and ribavirin combination therapy drug to drug interactions and cumulated toxicity between nucleoside analogues and anti-HCV therapy may be observed and concomitant didanosine use is contraindicated and zidovudine and stavudine should be avoided if possible. - The development of new drugs for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C represents a promising perspective also for HIV positive patients. However, these substances will probably reach clinical routine for HIV patients later than HCV monoinfected patients. Therefore at present waiting for new drugs is not an alternative to a modern pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy."

This study aims to measure the rate of TB, TB mortality, and associated risk factors following commencement of HAART in a cohort of patients attending HIV care in Ethiopia. Patient information was gathered from the hospital register and analysed. TB incidence peaked within six months of HAART initiation, and dropped from 3.3/100 person-years in the first year to 0.4/100 person-years in the fifth year. At baseline, risk factors associated with TB included WHO clinical stage 3 HIV infection (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 2.53; 95% CI 1.70-3.70), WHO clinical stage 4 HIV infection (AHR, 3.86; 95% CI 2.54-5.86), and patients who were bed ridden >50% a day (AHR, 1.52; 95% CI 1.13-2.05). The rate of mortality was 6.9% (incidence 2.8 per 100 person-years) and 57% of deaths occurred in the first six months of HAART initiation. Multivariate Cox model indicated WHO clinical stage 4 HIV infection, CD4+ cell count <50 cells/μl, bed ridden >50% a day, and TB after HAART initiation as baseline independent predictors of mortality. Additional evidence shows that regular CD4+monitoring of patients before HAART initiation as well as earlier HAART initiation decreases death, and regular clinical staging decreases TB incidence."

We analysed the variables associated with immunologic recovery, which is commonly regarded as the increase of CD4 to 350 cell/μL after a year of ART. We collected data from 3,485 patients attending a university-based HIV clinic from June 2005 to July 2014 in Shanghai, China. Logistic regression test was performed to analyse the risk factors for suboptimal CD4+ recovery following yearlong ART. The CD4+ T-cell of 723 participants (41.5% of the 1744 subjects) showed more than 350 cell/μL after one year of ART. Compared with baseline CD4 > 350 cell/μL, patients with baseline CD4 ≤ 200 cell/μL or 200 < CD4 ≤ 350 cell/μL were 42.6, 4.5 times more likely to be incomplete CD4 recovery, respectively. The risk of suboptimal immunologic recovery among patients with regimen including AZT or d4T were 2.1, 2.4 times higher compared with TDF, respectively. In our study, between optimal CD4 recovery group and suboptimal recovery group, there were no significant differences in age, gender, marital status, transmission routes, WHO stage, and CD4 recovery rates. As for the dynamic CD4 change, we found the CD4 recovery rates were 49.9% and 61.8% in the second and third year of ART, respectively. Patients who had a low level of CD4+ T-cell count (< 200 cell/μL) during the initiation of ART exhibited more difficulties recovering to a normal level. Furthermore, the regimen, including AZT or d4T, was not beneficial to CD4 recovery. So, more efforts should be made to guarantee the early diagnosis and timely treatment for HIV/AIDS patients, and simultaneously optimize antiretroviral therapy. "

The burden of tobacco smoking amongst people living with this infection is poorly understood in the African population. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence and determinants of tobacco smoking among HIV patients in North Eastern Nigeria. We enrolled 312 adult HIV sero-positive patients attending the Federal Medical Centre Yola, Nigeria. A modified World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended questionnaire was used to obtain information from consented subjects. The prevalence of current cigarette smoking among HIV patients was 22.1%. The male to female ratio of smokers was 2:1. Peer pressure (25.8%) and pleasure (25.8%) were reported as the most common reasons for smoking tobacco. Multivariate analysis shows that male gender, age ranged 40-49 years, alcohol drinking and CD4 T lymphocyte count <200 cells/mm3 were positively associated with tobacco smoking. The prevalence of tobacco smoking among HIV patients in North Eastern Nigeria was high. Therefore, smoking should be discouraged in people living with HIV to reduce their morbidity and mortality."
8505,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a dynamic state of interactions among HBV, the hepatocytes and the immune system of the patient. Perinatally or early childhood-acquired chronic HBV infection has a long 'immune tolerant phase', when patients are young, and HBeAg seropositive with a high viral load but with no significant liver disease. Persistent or episodic liver injuries during the 'immune clearance phase' may lead to decompensation, fibrosis progression or cirrhosis development in some patients, but may eventually lead to HBV-DNA seroclearance with HBeAg seroconversion and entry into the 'inactive phase' with remission. Hepatitis may relapse, because of reactivation of HBV with precore or basal core promptor mutations, and develop 'HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis', in some patients. In contrast, HBsAg seroclearance may occur in those with sustained remission. During the course, HBV replication is the key driver of disease progression including development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Among the currently available anti-HBV drugs, the most extensive and longest experience has been gained with conventional interferon (IFN)-alpha and lamivudine. A finite course of IFN therapy has long-term benefit in achieving a cumulative response, increasing HBsAg seroclearance and reducing cirrhosis and/or HCC. Maintained virological response to lamivudine therapy has a similar long-term benefit in reducing disease progression. Pegylated IFN and newer nucleos(t)ide analogues may have even better long-term outcomes because of better therapeutic efficacy and/or a low risk of drug resistances. The treatment outcomes are still far from satisfactory. The development of safe and affordable anti-HBV agents/strategies is needed to further improve outcomes."

However, more subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy experienced confirmed virologic rebound >50 copies/ml compared to a standard three-drug HAART regimen. In this study, we sought to determine the factors associated with maintenance of virologic suppression in subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy. Antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected volunteers were randomized 2:1 to initiate a lopinavir/ritonavir-based combination regimen followed by simplification to lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy or an efavirenz-based triple combination therapy and followed for 96 weeks. Potential predictors of time to loss of virologic response included baseline demographics, baseline HIV-1 RNA levels, baseline CD4(+) T cell counts, adherence as determined by 4-day subject recall, duration of HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml prior to simplification, and lopinavir concentrations. By the Cox proportional hazards model, higher reported adherence levels and higher baseline CD4(+) T cell counts were associated with a greater likelihood of maintaining virologic suppression while receiving lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy. Lopinavir concentrations, including trough concentrations, were not significantly associated with virologic outcomes. This analysis suggests that adherence and higher baseline CD4(+) T cell counts may help to predict who will sustain virologic suppression with lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy. The data also suggest that measuring lopinavir concentrations is not useful in predicting virologic response in these patients."

Health care workers have an elevated risk of acquiring HBV or HCV when performing exposure-prone procedures and transmitting these viruses to patients. The extent of viremia varies considerably in different carriers and the risk of transmission is different for the various procedures. According to reports from the last 15 years, highly viremic HBV carriers with HBeAg transmit the virus on average to 4% of their patients when performing operations with high risk of injuries. HBeAg-negative surgeons with a viremia between 10(6) and 10(7) HBV DNA molecules/ml transmit to 1.5% of the patients. The absence of reports on proven transmission caused by viremia <10(5) molecules/ml suggests a residual risk below 1:100,000 that a surgeon with lower virus load transmits to one patient within 15 years. Eight cases were reported where HCV-infected surgeons transmitted the virus to 0.15% of their patients (17/11,119) and had (as far as tested) around 10(6) HCV RNA molecules/ml or more. Current recommendations of the relevant professional associations and institutions require vaccination of medical staff against HBV with control of immunity, regular examinations of staff for HCV, and in cases of missing immunity for HBV. Infected staff with viremia must either abstain from exposure-prone procedures or have a decision from an expert committee on the acceptability of such procedures in view of the individual infection status."

This questionary survey was undertaken to determine the frequency and epidemiological characteristics of incidents involving biological exposures to blood and body fluids among health care workers (HCWs), at a University Hospital, in Izmir, Turkey. The survey was conducted using a questionnaire including questions related to demographics and epidemiological information. A total of 350 HCWs [162 physicians (academicians, seniors and juniors), 71 nurses, 55 interns of medical faculty, 45 cleaning staff, 12 nurse's aides, five technical/ managerial staff] were included to the survey. Of them, 203 (58%) have reported at least one exposure, 108 (%53.2) of them were physicians (p < 0.000) and 53 (26.1%) were nurses. The highest injury rate was reported by the nurse group (74.6%) followed by physicians (66.7%), cleaning staffs (57.8%) and interns (23.6%). Most of the occupational injuries (62.5%) have eventuated in the last one year. Types of exposure included percutaneous injury (97%) which was commonly caused by needle recapping (36%), suturing (25.6%) and handling of garbage bags (10.3%). Of the exposed HCWs, 138 (68%) have reported to use a protective equipment during the exposure and only 51.7% sought for medical assistance from the related department. Among 350 HCWs, 291 (83.1%) had been previously vaccinated against HBV, while two (0.6%) HCWs were chronically infected with HBV, unrelated with exposures. No transmission was reported following 16 incidents, in which the index patient was HBV, HCV or HIV carrier. In conclusion, percutanenous injuries are still common among HCWs. The results support the importance of the use of universal precautions and safety-enhanced devices, introducing effective training and efficient vaccination programs against HBV, in the clinical settings."

Factor analysis and the Rasch measurement model were used to determine a new subscale structure for the FAHI. The content of these subscales, including physical well-being (ten items, alpha = 0.91), function and global well-being (13 items, alpha = 0.86), emotional well-being/living with HIV (10 items, alpha = 0.82), social well-being (eight items, alpha = 0.73), and cognitive functioning (three items; alpha = 0.75), reflect both general illness- and HIV/AIDS-specific QoL concerns: a total QoL score can also be calculated for the FAHI (44 items, alpha = 0.91). Psychometric evaluation revealed good internal consistency reliability for the FAHI and its subscales. In addition, construct validity, known groups validity and sensitivity to change were demonstrated by significant associations between the FAHI and additional indicators of functional status, psychological symptoms, stress and illness severity. In summary, the FAHI is a psychometrically sound instrument that captures multiple important dimensions of HIV/AIDS-related QoL. It is brief, easy to administer and score, has been translated into nine languages other than English and is appropriate for use in clinical trials and clinical practice."

Local data on reported AIDS cases by risk factors, age, and sex are combined with local indices of the intravenous drug use population to estimate numbers of intravenous drug users. The Bronx is estimated to have 40,400 intravenous drug users (range, 28,080-52,800), 78% of whom fall into the age group 25-44 years. On the basis of local serosurveys, 45-55% are considered to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive. With Bronx population census data as the denominator, minimum rates of HIV seroprevalence are calculated for all Bronx males and females aged 25-44 years, a group comprising 76% of the AIDS cases in the Bronx through February 1, 1987. These data produce a population seroprevalence range for those aged 25-44 years of 5.4-12.5% for all Bronx males and 1.4-3.3% for females. For the South Bronx, with 66% of all intravenous drug users and 38% of the population, these age-specific HIV prevalence estimates are 9.4-21.6% for males and 2.4-5.5% for females."

It is a major risk factor for HCV/HIV coinfection, which significantly impacts on each disorder's progression. It appears that treatment response in IDUs with HCV or HIV is similar to non-IDUs with these viruses and that medication adherence and treatment outcomes are optimized when linked with substance abuse treatment.

In 2007, 40.6% of those living with HIV had been infected through heterosexual transmission and 38.1% through injection-drug use. Guangdong Province in southeastern China is the country's most populous province, with an estimated 75.6 million permanent residents and 16.5 million migrants; the province has undergone rapid economic development. Since 1986, a case-based surveillance system (CBSS) in China has collected data on persons infected with HIV, including demographic characteristics and transmission categories. To assess recent trends in HIV infection in the province, the Guangdong Center for Disease Control, with technical assistance from CDC, analyzed CBSS data for the period 1997--2007. The results of that analysis indicated that the number of HIV cases increased from 102 in 1997 to 4,593 in 2007, although this increase resulted, in part, from expanded testing and surveillance. Among males classified by HIV transmission category, 82.1% of newly diagnosed infections were attributed to injection-drug use. Among females classified by HIV transmission category, 53.7% engaged in high-risk heterosexual conduct.

It is estimated that 42 million people worldwide have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS, and that almost 12 million people have died from AIDS-related diseases through 1997. Among these 12 million are 3 million children. Two thirds of the more than 30 million people with HIV or AIDS reside in sub-Saharan Africa. In the United States, 641,086 patients have been diagnosed with AIDS through 1997, and at least 385,000 have died. However, for the first time, new highly active antiretroviral therapies that include multiple drugs that attack the virus at several sites have slowed the progression from HIV to AIDS and from AIDS to death for those infected with HIV. The cumulative effect of these changes has been a reduction in both AIDS incident cases and AIDS deaths. Recent epidemiologic trends indicate that the proportion of AIDS incident cases and new HIV infections are increasing among women, African-Americans, and Hispanics, and the infections are more likely to be acquired through heterosexual transmission. The clinical management of HIV infection and AIDS has become increasingly complex in recent years. In addition to complete medical and social histories and physical examinations, hematologic, biochemical, serologic, and immunologic laboratory tests are required to predict the likelihood that patients will develop opportunistic infections and other complications related to HIV infection. Among the most important laboratory tests are measurements of HIV in plasma (viral load) in conjunction with peripheral blood CD4+ helper T lymphocyte counts. These tests are potent predictors of disease progression and their results have become markers for clinical response to therapy. The development of highly active antiretroviral therapy has had a profound impact on the epidemiology of AIDS and on the lives of individual patients. Through combinations of antiretroviral drugs, especially protease inhibitors, viral suppression can be achieved. However, adherence to these complex medical regimens and drug interactions have been problems for many patients. In addition, numerous questions remain unanswered, most importantly those regarding the timing of the initiation of treatment, the durability of viral suppression and clinical response, and the optimal ""salvage"" regimens for patients failing therapy either clinically or virologically."

In the strategic scale-up of HIV care and treatment programs, persons with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) are a priority population for receiving ART. TB is the leading cause of death among persons living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa and remains a potential risk to the estimated 35 million persons living with HIV globally. Of the 9 million new cases of TB disease globally in 2013, an estimated 1.1 million (13%) were among persons living with HIV; of the 1.5 million deaths attributed to TB in 2013, a total of 360,000 (24%) were among persons living with HIV. ART reduces the incidence of HIV-associated TB disease, and early initiation of ART after the start of TB treatment reduces progression of HIV infection and death among HIV-positive TB patients. To assess the progress in scaling up ART provision among HIV-positive TB patients in 19 countries in sub-Saharan Africa with high TB and HIV burdens, TB and HIV data collected by the World Health Organization (WHO) were reviewed. The results found that the percentage of HIV-positive TB patients receiving ART increased from 37% in 2010 to 69% in 2013. However, many TB cases among persons who are HIV-positive go unreported, and only 38% of the estimated number of HIV-positive new TB patients received ART in 2013.

The relative risk of TB among HIV-infected persons, compared with that among HIV-uninfected persons, ranges from 20- and 37-fold, depending on the state of the HIV epidemic. In 2008, 1.4 million patients with TB were tested globally for HIV, and 81 countries tested more than half of their patients with TB for HIV. Only 4% of all persons infected with HIV were screened for TB in the same year. Decentralization of HIV treatment services and strengthening of its integration with TB services are essential.

Both treatment and host immunity impose selection pressures on the highly mutable HIV-1 genome resulting in antiretroviral resistance and immune escape. Researchers have shown that antiretroviral resistance mutations can shape cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immunity by altering the epitope repertoire of HIV infected cells. Here it was discovered that an important antiretroviral resistance mutation, L90M in HIV protease, occurs at lower frequencies in hosts that harbor the B*15, B*48 or A*32 human leukocyte antigen subtypes. A likely reason is the elucidation of novel epitopes by L90M. NetMHCPan predictions reveal increased affinity of the peptide spanning the HIV protease region, PR 89-97 and PR 90-99 to HLA-B*15/B*48 and HLA-A*32 respectively due to the L90M substitution. The higher affinity could increase the chance of the epitope being presented and recognized by Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and perhaps provide additional immunological pressures in the presence of antiretroviral attenuating mutations. This evidence supports the notion that knowledge of HLA allotypes in HIV infected individuals could augment antiretroviral treatment by the elucidation of epitopes due to antiretroviral resistance mutations in HIV protease.

Genotype data were generated for the protease and reverse transcriptase genes of HIV-1 proviral DNA from 91 infected infants. Eleven infants (12.1%) had provirus with mutations associated with drug resistance, with all three classes of antiretroviral drugs represented. Two infants (2.2%) had mutations associated with resistance to two classes of antiretrovirals. Perinatal antiretroviral drug exposure was examined; it was not found to be significantly associated with the presence of resistance mutations. However, for those infants who had perinatal antiretroviral exposure and genotypic evidence of drug resistance to HIV, the mutations that were detected correlated with at least one antiretroviral from the perinatal period. The prevalence of genotypic drug resistance among this infant cohort is comparable with that found among recently infected adults. These results suggest that resistance testing should be strongly considered for perinatally infected infants, at the earliest possible time point, to avoid use of antiretroviral drugs to which the infant has preexisting resistance."

In HCV monoinfected patients, several interferon alfa-sparing, all-oral regimens demonstrated cure rates of greater than 90% with 12 weeks of treatment, including for hard-to-treat patients. Cure rates of 75% were attained in HIV/HCV coinfected patients with the addition of the investigational HCV protease inhibitor (PI) simeprevir to peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Drug-drug interaction data to inform safe coadminstration of antiretroviral therapy with DAA-based HCV treatment were presented. There was continued emphasis on pathogenesis, management, and prevention of the long-term complications of HIV disease and its therapies, including cardiovascular disease, renal disease, alterations in bone metabolism, and vitamin D deficiency, along with a growing focus on biomarkers to predict development of end-organ disease. Understanding the elevated risk for non-AIDS-defining malignancies in the HIV-infected population and optimal management was a focal point of this year's data. Finally, the conference provided important information on tuberculosis coinfection and cryptococcal meningitis."

A cross-sectional examination of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who attended a public HIV outpatient clinic and died between 1996 and 2001 was conducted (n = 669). All clinical and demographic data were collected from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Adult Spectrum of Disease database. The prevalence of first-time acquisition of AIDS-defining conditions 12 months before death were evaluated. The prevalence of renal disease, hepatic disease and substance use were also evaluated. The majority of the patients were 35 years old or older, male, African American and HAART-experienced. The six AIDS-defining conditions with the highest percentages of first-time acquisition in the last 12 months of life were HIV dementia (91.8%), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (91.7%), wasting (90.9%), Mycobacterium avium complex infection (MAC) (80.0%), lymphoma (78.6%), and cytomegalovirus infection (CMV) (78.1%). Forty-four percent of the patients were diagnosed with at least one of these six conditions 12 months before death. More than one third of the patients had renal or hepatic failure, injecting drug use (IDU) as the HIV risk factor, and history of substance use. AIDS-defining conditions continue to have an impact on mortality, especially the neurologic conditions and wasting. However, other conditions, such as renal and hepatic disease, are becoming important causes of mortality because the HIV-infected population now includes more drug users, and HIV-infected patients are surviving for longer periods. These results should help clinicians better time the discussion of end-stage options and improve the patient's quality of life."
15448,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The ability of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to persist in a latent stage in memory T cells in the presence of antiretroviral therapy poses a major obstacle to the development of an HIV-1 therapy with curative intent. As latently infected cells are phenotypically not distinguishable from uninfected cells, therapeutic reactivation of the latent infection, followed by the death of the host cell induced by viral cytopathicity, is considered the only means to eliminate this viral reservoir. To identify compounds with the potential to reactivate latent HIV-1, we have developed a series of latently HIV-1-infected reporter cell lines that allow for high throughput drug screening (HTS) in a 384-well plate-based format. The latent reporter cell lines use enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) as a direct and quantitative marker of HIV-1 expression. To aid identification of specific compounds, the cells are engineered to constitutively express a second, red fluorescent protein that has no spectral overlap with eGFP, which allows for the simultaneous quantification of cell viability (inversely correlated to compound toxicity). Thus, these reporters enable prioritization of compounds most likely to have a favorable therapeutic window. The high dynamic signal range and the excellent reproducibility of the primary screening assay result in a Z' -factor of 0.89, which characterizes the HTS system as very robust. The assay has been implemented for automated drug screening, and we here discuss the advantages and limitations of the HTS system based on the data obtained for 1,600 compounds during a limited proof-of-concept drug screen."

In this study, we developed a novel HIV-1 genotypic assay based on deep sequencing (DeepGen HIV) to simultaneously assess HIV-1 susceptibilities to all drugs targeting the three viral enzymes and to predict HIV-1 coreceptor tropism. Patient-derived gag-p2/NCp7/p1/p6/pol-PR/RT/IN- and env-C2V3 PCR products were sequenced using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine. Reads spanning the 3' end of the Gag, protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN), and V3 regions were extracted, truncated, translated, and assembled for genotype and HIV-1 coreceptor tropism determination. DeepGen HIV consistently detected both minority drug-resistant viruses and non-R5 HIV-1 variants from clinical specimens with viral loads of ≥1,000 copies/ml and from B and non-B subtypes. Additional mutations associated with resistance to PR, RT, and IN inhibitors, previously undetected by standard (Sanger) population sequencing, were reliably identified at frequencies as low as 1%. DeepGen HIV results correlated with phenotypic (original Trofile, 92%; enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay [ESTA], 80%; TROCAI, 81%; and VeriTrop, 80%) and genotypic (population sequencing/Geno2Pheno with a 10% false-positive rate [FPR], 84%) HIV-1 tropism test results. DeepGen HIV (83%) and Trofile (85%) showed similar concordances with the clinical response following an 8-day course of maraviroc monotherapy (MCT). In summary, this novel all-inclusive HIV-1 genotypic and coreceptor tropism assay, based on deep sequencing of the PR, RT, IN, and V3 regions, permits simultaneous multiplex detection of low-level drug-resistant and/or non-R5 viruses in up to 96 clinical samples. This comprehensive test, the first of its class, will be instrumental in the development of new antiretroviral drugs and, more importantly, will aid in the treatment and management of HIV-infected individuals.

Opiates are well known to modulate immune responses by preventing the development of cell-mediated immune responses. Their effect on the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection however remains controversial. Using the simian immunodeficiency virus/macaque model of HIV pathogenesis, we sought to explore the impact of morphine on disease progression and pathogenesis. Sixteen rhesus macaques were divided into two groups; four were administered saline and 12 others morphine routinely. Both groups of animals were then inoculated with SIVmacR71/17E and followed longitudinally for disease pathogenesis. The morphine group (M+V) exhibited a trend towards higher mortality rates and retardation in weight gain compared to the virus-alone group. Interestingly, a subset of M+V animals succumbed to disease within weeks post-infection. These rapid progressors also exhibited a higher incidence of other end-organ pathologies. Despite the higher numbers of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the M+V group, CD4/CD8 ratios between the groups remained unchanged. Plasma and CSF viral load in the M+V group was at least a log higher than the control group. Similarly, there was a trend toward increased virus build-up in the brains of M+V animals compared with controls. A novel finding of this study was the increased influx of infected monocyte/macrophages in the brains of M+V animals."

Fifteen patients who had received at least 1 year of therapy with two or three drug combinations of zidovudine, didanosine, and nevirapine had suitable samples of lymph node tissue obtained by ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy. HIV RNA was extracted from homogenized tissue samples and quantitated using a modified branched DNA assay. Results were correlated with antiretroviral treatment effect on the basis of plasma virus load measurements over the preceding 12-18 months. A statistically significant negative correlation was observed between magnitude of treatment effect on plasma viremia and lymph node virus load. These data suggest that combinations of antiretroviral drugs that produce sustained suppression of plasma HIV RNA may also be able to reduce the virus burden in lymphoid tissues."

Infection occurred in 5 out of 76 infants (6.6%) born to 69 viraemic mothers and in none of 29 born to 26 non-viraemic mothers. Only one child was HCV RNA positive one month after birth, while the remaining children became positive at the 3rd to 4th month. HCV genotypes of the babies matched those of their mothers. No difference was found between women who transmitted the virus and those who did not with regard to age, history of drug abuse, HIV infection, ALT abnormal values, HCV genotype, type of delivery, and breast-feeding. Four out of 5 infected infants were born to mothers with IgM anti-HCV (P = 0.04). The mean viral titre in transmitting women (10(7.2)) was higher than in non-transmitting (10(6.5)), and the proportion of mothers with viral load > or = 10(7) was statistically higher in transmitting than non-transmitting women (P = 0.03). These data show that HCV perinatal infection is a rare event and suggest that IgM positivity and high viral load (> or = 10(7)) in the mother are independent variables correlated with HCV transmission (O.R. = 14.5; 95% CI: 1.3-160.7 and O.R. = 16.3; 95% CI: 1.5-179.9, respectively)."

The CNS HIV Anti-Retroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) cohort is a six-center US-based prospective cohort with bi-annual follow-up of 674 participants. We fit linear mixed models (N = 233) and discrete-time survival models (N = 154; 832 observations) to evaluate trajectories of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) II scores and the incidence of new-onset moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms (BDI ≥ 17) among participants on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), who were free of depression at study entry and received a minimum of three CSF examinations over 2496 person-months follow-up. Detectable CSF HIV RNA (threshold ≥50 copies/ml) at any visit was associated with a 4.7-fold increase in new-onset depression at subsequent visits adjusted for plasma HIV RNA and treatment adherence; hazard ratio (HR) = 4.76, (95 % CI 1.58-14.3); P = 0.006.

6210,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a form of skin cancer, most commonly found in individuals suffering from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. However, before the worldwide infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the rare occurrence of KS was confined to two distinct groups of individuals. In the Western world, the classical form of KS was often found in older men (60-70 years of age) from the Mediterranean area. Another form called endemic KS, was found in Equatorial Africa. Currently, the most common cases of KS are found in individuals suffering from AIDS. This is called AIDS-associated KS. Between 30 and 40% of male, homosexual AIDS patients suffer from AIDS-associated KS. KS is also occasionally diagnosed in transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs (to keep their body from rejecting the foreign organ). As opposed to cases of classic and endemic KS, the KS in AIDS patients progresses very quickly, often with a fatal outcome. Human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) has been implicated as the cause of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), but the exact connection of the virus to the neoplasm is not known. The virus has been detected within the sarcoma skin lesions, but has additionally been seen in peripheral blood cells, semen samples, prostate tissue, and other types of soft tissue tumors. In this study, we evaluated HHV-8 within the skin lesion of KS as well as in semen specimens obtained from HIV-1 infected and uninfected specimens from HIV-1-seronegative individuals. Twenty-eight tissue samples representing AIDS-associated, endemic KS, and six non-KS patients were collected for observation from different centers throughout the world. The tissues were examined utilizing in situ polymerase chain reaction (ISPCR) and hybridization to identify and localize the herpesvirus within the KS lesions. With the use of the sensitive ISPCR technique, HHV-8 DNA was detected in the spindle cells within the nodular skin lesions, as well as in the microvascular endothelial cells which line small vessels within the lesions in all forms of KS. In addition, we analysed semen specimens from HIV-1 infected and uninfected men, our analyses revealed that HHV-8 was present in the significant proportions of the HIV-1-infected-individuals' sperm, as well as in the mononuclear cells of the semen specimens. HHV-8 DNA was demonstrated, by ISPCR, in KS lesions as well as in seminal mononuclear cells and sperm of significantly high proportion of HIV-1-infected men. What role the presence of HHV-8 in the sperm cells plays in the sexual transmission of this herpesvirus will require further study. However, the reports which demonstrate that KS lesions can develop in infants of only a few weeks of age, increases the possibility that this agent may be vertically transmitted. It can be suggested that HHV-8 is relatively ubiquitous and its frequency increases with the increasing immunosuppression."
19003,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Great strides have been made in the therapy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Currently approved drugs include zidovudine and didanosine. A third drug, dideoxycytidine (zalcitibine), has recently been filed for approval with the Food and Drug Administration. All these drugs work through inhibition of the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Zidovudine is the only drug that has shown clinical efficacy against HIV. Treatment of patients with advanced HIV disease (i.e., acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS] or symptomatic infection with < 200 CD4+ lymphocytes per mm3), results in a prolongation and improved quality of life. Zidovudine is the only antiretroviral agent approved for the treatment of asymptomatic patients. Early intervention with zidovudine has been shown to delay progression to AIDS when patients' CD4+ lymphocyte counts decline to less than 500/mm3, irrespective of clinical signs or symptoms of HIV infection. Didanosine is currently indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced HIV disease who are intolerant to or failing zidovudine therapy. The major toxicity of zidovudine is bone marrow suppression with anemia and granulocytopenia (which occurs in from 1% to 45% of patients, depending on the clinical stage of disease and the dose of the drug). Didanosine and zalcitibine have both been associated with a severe peripheral neuropathy, which is generally reversible on cessation of the drug. In addition, didanosine has been implicated as a cause of pancreatitis that has been fatal in a small percentage of cases. The toxicities of didanosine and zalcitibine range from 1% to 10%, depending on dose, duration of therapy, and the presence of underlying HIV-related peripheral neuropathy or a previous history of pancreatitis. The clinical hallmark of HIV infection is the development of opportunistic infections and malignancies, which are a consequence of the profound immunodeficiency. The risk of an opportunistic infection increases significantly as the T-helper lymphocyte count declines to less than 20%, or 200 to 250/mm3. The spectrum of opportunistic infections ranges from viruses to protozoa. Patients with advanced HIV disease are also at increased risk of infection with nonopportunistic, community-acquired pathogens. Primary and secondary prophylaxis against the most common AIDS-defining opportunistic infection, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, is now recommended. Studies are currently underway to determine the efficacy of prophylaxis against other opportunistic pathogens. Treatment of opportunistic infections associated with AIDS has improved significantly over the past 5 years as new drugs and combination regimens of antimicrobials have been developed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Recent survival statistics show that patients infected with HIV treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can expect a significant prolongation of life by interfering with the natural progression of HIV to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Therefore, HIV-positive patients experiencing complications of liver failure are at greater immediate risk of dying from their end-stage liver disease (ESLD) rather than their HIV. Many transplant centers still consider HIV infection as a contraindication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). At our two institutions, we believe that patients with HIV suffering from ESLD should be considered for OLT. This study evaluates the survival of patients undergoing OLT with HIV under HAART therapy. OLT was performed in 16 patients with HIV suffering from ESLD as a result of chronic HCV, chronic HBV, or fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). Collected data include patient demographics, patient and graft survival, pre-OLT assessments, and postoperative complications (including opportunistic infections). Ten patients at Pittsburgh and 6 patients at Miami received OLT. Of the 16 patients who received OLT, 14 remain alive to date. Thirteen of 16 patients are more than 12 months post-OLT, whereas the last patient is currently 6 months post-OLT. Five patients at Miami and 9 of 10 patients at Pittsburgh received HAART therapy before OLT, although 2 of the Pittsburgh patients had their HAART therapy discontinued before OLT because of significant liver dysfunction. The pre-OLT viral loads were undetectable in 13 of 16 patients. The cluster determinant (CD)4 count was less than 200 in 6 patients and greater than 100 in 2 patients before OLT. In all patients, CD4 counts increased above 200 in the post-OLT period. Tacrolimus toxicity associated with the pharmacologic inhibition of cytochrome p450 metabolism caused by protease inhibitors occurred in 6 patients after OLT. Six patients (38%) experienced acute cellular rejection immediately after OLT. Our experience suggests that OLT is effective in selected HIV-positive patients suffering from ESLD. Patient and graft survival was similar to non-HIV-positive patients suffering from the same indications for OLT. Acute cellular rejection was no less frequent that seen in non-HIV-positive patients. Given the complex pharmacologic interactions between the protease inhibitors and tacrolimus, careful monitoring, and attention is required to prevent toxicity or underdosing."

A prospective, descriptive-comparative study was conducted to compare incidence and severity of ADRs secondary to ART in older (≥ 50 years) versus younger (<50 years) HIV-infected patients. No differences were found in the presence or severity of subjective or objective ADRs between groups. The burden of intolerance appeared to be high for certain ADRs in both age groups. Regardless of age, subjects with certain concomitant illnesses had higher rates of potential ADRs. Providers need to be aware of patient characteristics that lead to increased rates of ART intolerance; for patients with an increased comorbidity burden, providers need to be attentive to the potential impact on ART tolerability."

We estimated the prevalence of and assessed associations with inadequate glycemic control, defined as hemoglobin A(1c) ≥ 7.5% for ≥ 50% of quarters over the year, and determined rates of meeting ADA clinical goals. Ninety-two percent of patients received antiretroviral therapy. The prevalence of inadequate glycemic control was 33% (95% confidence interval [CI] 25%-42%). Compared to patients with adequate control, those with inadequate control had fewer years since HIV diagnosis (12.7 versus 15.1, p = 0.01), increased use of insulin (60% versus 20%, p < 0.001) or any diabetic medication (98% versus 85%, p = 0.02), and higher triglyceride levels (238 versus 168 mg/dL, p = 0.008). Rates of achieving ADA goals were 42% for blood pressure, 66% for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), 33% for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 31% for triglycerides. Thirty-six percent of patients who did not meet the LDL-C goal received statin therapy. Forty-seven percent of patients were screened for retinopathy and 19% of patients without preexisting renal disease were screened for nephropathy. In conclusion, the prevalence of inadequate glycemic control in HIV-infected patients with diabetes is similar to published data from the general population.

Immunizations took place at week 0, 4, 12 and the boosting dose is planned at week 36. The 10 children in the vaccine group have received the first 3 priming doses of the HIVIS vaccine. Safety data showed good tolerance to the vaccination schedule. Mild cutaneous self-limeted reactions consisted of local irritation, usually itching or erythema +/- swelling at the injection site, were reported. No severe systemic adverse events have been observed. No vaccinated children had a decrease of CD4 T-cell counts from baseline. None experienced virological failure.

The vaccine was well tolerated and HIV RNA levels remained undetectable following three immunizations. CD4 counts in vaccine recipients were significantly higher compared to the control individuals after 12 months. HIV-specific responses were associated with higher gain in CD4 counts following LFn-p24C immunizations. Volunteers were subsequently asked to undergo a 30-day period of observed treatment interruption. 8/24 (30%) individuals showed no evidence of viral rebound during treatment interruption. All demonstrated prompt suppression of viral load following resumption of ART.

Very high levels of adherence to HAART are a prerequisite for a successful virological and immunological response. Low adherence increases the risk of treatment failure and disease progression. It is also likely to lead to further transmission of resistant viruses, and to have a negative impact on the cost effectiveness of HAART. Low adherence is difficult to predict, and this has two key implications for service provision. Firstly, HAART should not be withheld on the basis of assumptions about adherence. Secondly, support with adherence should be provided to all patients prescribed HAART. Our understanding of barriers to and enablers of high adherence, and the evidence base regarding effective interventions, is limited. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials available from the general literature suggests multiple interventions are required to maintain high adherence to chronic therapy. This document recommends a series of measures for adoption within HIV clinical care settings, based on evaluation of existing data. High adherence is a process, not a single event, and therefore adherence support must be integrated into clinical follow up. Every prescribing unit should have a written policy on provision of adherence support, and ensure that staff are appropriately trained to make delivery of such services possible."

Multiple studies now suggest that the incidence rates of HIV-associated neurological disease and central nervous system (CNS) opportunistic infections also are decreasing. Since the introduction of HAART in 1996, the incidence of HIV dementia has decreased by approximately 50%. The mean CD4 cell count for new cases of HIV dementia is increasing, but it remains as a complication of moderate-advanced immunosuppression. The incidence of HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy has decreased, although the incidence of antiretroviral drug-induced toxic neuropathy has increased. However, as patients with AIDS live longer as a result of HAART, the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in HIV-seropositive patients may be increasing. The incidence rates of CNS opportunistic infections (cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) and primary CNS lymphoma have decreased since the introduction of HAART.

Because endogenous reverse transcription is implicated in augmenting the sexual transmission of HIV-1, potential microbicides should have the inherent ability to optimally inhibit both wild-type and drug-resistant mutant strains of HIV-1. N-[2-(2,5-dimethoxyphenylethyl)]-N'-[2-(5-bromopyridyl)]-thiourea (PHI-236) is a rationally designed non-nucleoside inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (NNRTI) that was deduced from changes in binding pocket size, shape and residue character that result from clinically observed NNRTI resistance mutations. PHI-236 displayed high-binding affinity (Ludi K(i) = 0.07 microM) for HIV-1 RT and robust anti-HIV activity against the wild type (IC50 = <0.001 microM) as well as primary clinical isolates (IC50 = 0.009-0.04 microM) carrying multiple RT gene mutations associated with NRTI and NNRTI resistance. PHI-236 displayed high-selectivity index against human vaginal and cervical epithelial cells and did not affect human sperm functions. In the humanized severe combined immunodeficient mouse model for HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), pretreatment of HIV-1 (BaL)-infected human monocytes and semen with PHI-236 prevented the systemic infection via the vaginal route. PHI-236 has particular clinical utility as a non-spermicidal microbicide as well as a prophylactic antiviral agent to inactivate cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 in semen before assisted reproductive technology procedures."

Of 778 HIV-1-infected individuals enrolled in the study from September 2001 to December 2003, and followed up until June 2004, 757 were tested for anti-HCV antibodies. Of these, 159 (21.0%) showed positive results for anti-HCV. Males, individuals in the 25 to 34 year age range, and individuals of lower economic levels were more likely to be seropositive for both viruses [prevalence rate (PR), 2.04; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.43-2.92; p<0.001]. The anti-HCV reactivity was also associated with blood routes of transmission (PR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.28-3.77; p<0.001), intravenous drug use (PR, 5.79; 95% CI, 4.74-7.07; p<0.001), self-reported previous sexually transmitted diseases (PR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.18-2.04; p=0.002), VDRL positivity (PR, 2.87; 95% CI, 2.40-3.43; p<0.001), and anti-HTLV I/II reactivity (PR, 5.09; 95% CI, 4.16-6.23; p<0.001). In the follow-up period, the HCV/HIV-1-co-infected patients showed a trend toward lower CD4+ T-cell counts, higher HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load and faster disease progression than patients infected only with HIV-1, but significant differences were not observed. Although there were proportionately more deaths in the HCV/HIV-1-co-infected group, the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was a string predictor of increased CD4+ T-cell counts and decreased HIV-1 RNA plasma levels, suggesting that HAART is more important to the immunological and virological outcomes in HIV-1 infection than is HCV co-infection status."

Our objective was to examine to what extent this association holds among HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infected people. We used data from a prospective cohort study of HIV-HCV co-infected people in Canada. FI was measured using the ten-item adult scale of Health Canada's Household Food Security Survey Module and was classified into three categories: food secure, moderate FI, and severe FI. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) and was classified into absence or presence of depressive symptoms. FI, depressive symptoms, and other covariates were updated every 6 months. The association between FI and depressive symptoms was assessed using a stabilized inverse probability weighted marginal structural model. The study sample included 725 HIV-HCV co-infected people with 1973 person-visits over 3 years of follow up. At baseline, 23% of participants experienced moderate food insecurity, 34% experienced severe food insecurity and 52% had depressive symptoms. People experiencing moderate FI had 1.63 times (95% CI 1.44-1.86) the risk of having depressive symptoms and people experiencing severe FI had 2.01 times (95% CI 1.79-2.25) the risk of having depressive symptoms compared to people who were food secure. FI is a risk factor for developing depressive symptoms among HIV-HCV co-infected people. Food supplementation, psychosocial support and counseling may improve patient health outcomes."

To examine this hypothesis, we investigated helminth infection in a cohort of HIV-1-seropositive adults in Entebbe, Uganda, during November 1999 to January 2000. Individuals with helminths were treated. At enroLlment, after 5 weeks and after 4 months, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts and viral load were measured. Cytokine responses (interferon [IFN]-gamma, interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4 and IL-5) to Schistosoma mansoni adult worm antigen (SWA), Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture filtrate proteins (CFPs) and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) were measured in a whole blood assay. At baseline, CD4+ T cell counts and CD4+: CD8+ ratios were higher in individuals with helminths than in those without (median CD4+ T cell counts 467/microL and 268/microL, respectively, P = 0.005). Viral load was lower among those with helminths but this was not statistically significant. During follow-up, CD4+ T cell counts and cytokine responses to PHA fell among individuals without helminths. Among those treated for helminths, CD4+ counts remained stable. Viral loads showed a transient increase at 5 weeks, which was more marked among those treated for helminths, but the levels at 4 months were similar to baseline in both groups. Among those with schistosomiasis, IFN-gamma and IL-2 responses to CFP, and IL-2 and IL-4 responses to PHA declined but there was a sustained increase in cytokine responses to SWA following treatment. These data do not support the hypothesis that helminth infection exacerbates HIV infection. The possibility that chronic helminth infection may suppress HIV replication and that effects on HIV replication may vary during helminth infection and treatment should be considered."

Psychiatric disorders were assessed in a sample of HIV-positive (HIV+) and HIV-negative (HIV-) intravenous drug users every 6 months for 3 years. Results indicated that HIV status and baseline MDD independently predicted persistent or recurrent episodes of MDD after gender, drug use, ethnicity, income, and the presence other psychiatric disorders were controlled statistically. Among HIV+ intravenous drug users with baseline MDD, 90% experienced at least one subsequent episode of MDD and 47% experienced at least three subsequent episodes of MDD. However, less than 40% of intravenous drug users with current MDD received treatment for emotional problems. These findings indicate that intravenous drug users with HIV infection and a history of MDD are at considerable risk for future episodes of MDD or recurrent MDD, and that increased provision of treatment for intravenous drug users with MDD may be necessary."

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been linked to increased risk of lymphoma among immunocompetent individuals. We therefore investigated the association between HCV infection and PTLD in a retrospective cohort study of all individuals in the United States who received their first solid organ transplant from 1994 to 2005 (N = 210 763) using Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data. During follow-up, 1630 patients with PTLD were diagnosed. HCV prevalence at transplantation was 11.3%. HCV infection did not increase PTLD risk in the total cohort (Cox regression model, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.05), even after adjustment for type of organ transplanted, indication for transplantation, degree of HLA mismatch, donor type, or use of immunosuppression medications. Additional analyses also revealed no association by PTLD subtype (defined by site, pathology, cell type, and tumor Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] status). HCV infection did increase PTLD risk among the 2.8% of patients (N = 5959) who were not reported to have received immunosuppression maintenance medications prior to hospital discharge (HR = 3.09; 95% CI, 1.14-8.42; P interaction = .007). Our findings suggest that HCV is not a major risk factor for PTLD, which is consistent with the model in which an intact immune system is necessary for development of HCV-related lymphoproliferation."

However, investigation of the lipodystrophy syndrome has generally been limited to men; and a comprehensive evaluation of insulin, lipids, and regional body composition has not been performed in the expanding population of HIV-infected women. In this study, we assessed fasting insulin, lipid levels, virologic parameters, and regional body composition, using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, in a cohort of 75 HIV-infected women (age, 25-46 yr), in comparison with 30 healthy weight-matched premenopausal control subjects. HIV-infected women demonstrated significant truncal adiposity (38.5 +/- 0.9 vs. 34.9 +/- 1.3%, P < 0.05) hyperinsulinemia (15.9 +/- 1.5 vs. 7.5 +/- 0.6 microU/mL, P < 0.001) and an increased insulin-to-glucose ratio (0.2 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.1 +/- 0.03, P < 0.001), compared with control subjects. Insulin and the insulin-to-glucose ratio were increased, even among HIV-infected patients with low body weight (<90% of ideal body weight) (insulin, 13.3 +/- 2.8 microU/mL, P < 0.01 vs. control; insulin/glucose, 0.2 +/- 0.04, P < 0.01 vs. control). Insulin and the insulin-to-glucose ratio were most significantly elevated among patients with increased truncal adiposity (insulin, 28.2 +/- 3.2 microU/mL, P < 0.001 vs. control; insulin/ glucose, 0.32 +/- 0.04, P < 0.001 vs. control). In contrast, no differences in insulin were seen in relation to protease inhibitor (PI) use. Similarly, HIV-infected women also demonstrated significant hypertriglyceridemia (144 +/- 15 vs. 66 +/- 23 mg/dL, P < 0.01 vs. controls), which was present even among low-weight patients (148 +/- 32 mg/dL, P < 0.001 vs. control) but was not related to truncal adiposity or PI usage. These data demonstrate significant hyperinsulinemia and truncal adiposity in HIV-infected women. Our data suggest that these metabolic abnormalities occur at baseline in HIV-infected women, independent of PI use. However, these data do not rule out a direct effect of PI therapy on fat metabolism or indirect effects of PI therapy to further worsen glucose and lipid homeostasis in association with weight gain and disease recovery."

Services also are offered to women in family planning and prenatal/obstetric clinics to increase HIV prevention efforts among women and decrease the risk for perinatal HIV transmission. To increase use of HIV counseling, testing, and referral services by those at risk for HIV infection, in 1995, the National Association of People with AIDS designated June 27 each year as National HIV Testing Day.

Low levels of serum zinc concentrations may increase risk of depression in general population. However, research on the role of zinc in depression among HIV- infected person is limited. We assessed the association between serum zinc concentrations and depression in HIV-infected persons. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 311 HIV-positive people (177 men and 134 women) aged 18-60 years residing in Kathmandu, Nepal. The atomic absorption method was used to measure serum zinc concentrations and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-Ia method was used to measure depression, with cut off score 20 or higher consistent with clinically significant depression. Relationships were assessed using multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. Serum zinc concentrations were significantly inversely associated with depression in all participants and in men but not in women. Participants with the highest tertile of serum zinc concentrations had a significantly decreased risk of depression in men but not in women. Serum zinc concentrations were inversely associated with depressive symptoms scores in HIV-infected men. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm the role of zinc in depression among persons infected with HIV."

A total of 6,913 HIV+ patients > or = 13 years of age were enrolled in the ASD database between 1990 and 1998. After an average follow-up of 42 months, cryptosporidiosis had been diagnosed in 239 patients (3.5%). The risk of developing cryptosporidiosis was higher among patients with CD4+ cell counts < 100 x 10(6)/L, among those who ever developed an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-opportunistic illness, and among patients < 35 years old compared with their counterparts. A slight increase in cryptosporidiosis cases occurred in the spring compared with other seasons, but the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The prevalence of cryptosporidiosis increased from 2.9% (n = 7) in 1989 to 20% in 1994 (n = 48) before decreasing to 5.3% in 1998 (n = 14). Since a fair number of cryptosporidiosis cases are still being reported in the New Orleans area after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, further studies are needed to provide insight into the existence of potential environmental sources of Cryptosporidium."

We used generalized linear models with Poisson error structure to model excess mortality rates.In 10,340 patients, 368 deaths occurred. Excess mortality was 0.82 deaths per 100 person-years for all-cause mortality, 0.11 for liver, 0.08 for non-AIDS-defining malignancies (NADMs), 0.08 for non-AIDS infections, and 0.02 for cardiovascular-related causes. Lower CD4 count and higher HIV viral load, lower education, being male, and over 50 years were predictors of overall excess mortality. Short-term (first year follow-up) overall excess hazard ratio (eHR) for subjects with AIDS at entry was 3.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.66, 5.19) and 1.37 (95% CI 0.87, 2.15) for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected; medium/long-term eHR for AIDS at entry was 0.90 (95% CI 0.58, 1.39) and 3.83 (95% CI 2.37, 6.19) for HCV coinfection. Liver excess mortality was associated with low CD4 counts and HCV coinfection. Patients aged ≥50 years and HCV-coinfected showed higher NADM excess mortality, and HCV-coinfected patients showed increased non-AIDS infections excess mortality.Overall, liver, NADM, non-AIDS infections, and cardiovascular excesses of mortality associated with being HIV-positive were found, and HCV coinfection and immunodeficiency played significant roles. Differential short and medium/long-term effects of AIDS at entry and HCV coinfection were found for overall excess mortality. "

Of them 63 were CCR5 Delta32 heterozygotes and 233 CCR5 wild-type. The incidence rate of a first episode of herpes zoster was 4.2% and 5.3% per person-year, respectively. A higher occurrence of herpes zoster was strongly related to a lower CD4 + cell count. After adjustment for age, presence of CCR2b 64I heterozygosity, HIV RNA load, time since seroconversion, and CD4 + cell count, the rate ratio for herpes zoster of CCR5 Delta32 was 0.9 (95%CI 0.5-1.6). In conclusion, in HIV-1-infected homosexual men, a CCR5 Delta32 heterozygous genotype has no protective effect on the incidence of herpes zoster."

We analyzed data of three ART programs: Khayelitsha township and Tygerberg Hospital programs in Cape Town and Themba Lethu program in Johannesburg. We included patients aged >16 years. ART was defined as a regimen of at least three drugs. We estimated incidence rates of KS for patients on ART and not on ART. We calculated Cox models adjusted for age, sex and time-updated CD4 cell counts and HIV-1 RNA. A total of 18,254 patients (median age 34.5 years, 64% female, median CD4 cell count at enrolment 105 cells/μL) were included. During 37,488 person-years follow-up 162 patients developed KS. The incidence was 1,682/100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 1,406-2,011) among patients not receiving ART and 138/100,000 person-years (95% CI 102-187) among patients on ART. The adjusted hazard ratio comparing time on ART with time not on ART was 0.19 (95% CI 0.13-0.28). Low CD4 cell counts (time-updated) and male sex were also associated with KS. Estimated survival of KS patients at one year was 72.2% (95% CI 64.9-80.2) and higher in men than in women. The incidence of KS is substantially lower on ART than not on ART. Timely initiation of ART is essential to prevent KS and KS-associated morbidity and mortality in South Africa and other regions in Africa with a high burden of HIV. "

Results were analyzed both in terms of total population and of HCV genotype. The study of the total population suggests that this therapy did not determine a significant alteration of HCV viremia and levels of ALT, while a significant decrease in HIV viremia (-1.7log10 at one year from the start of HAART) and increase in CD4+ counts was observed (P < 0.005).

In this study, the recovery of CD4+ T cells following HAART among antiretroviral-naïve patients seropositive for HIV with and without HCV coinfection was investigated. Two hundred one HIV-infected patients without previous exposure to antiretroviral drugs were included in the study. HCV coinfection was detected in 123 (61%) patients. The time to recover 200 CD4+ cells/ microl was longer in the HCV-positive group ( P<0.001). In a Cox model, HCV infection and lack of persistent HIV viremia (defined as <200 copies/ml) were associated with the time to recover 200 CD4+ cells/ microl. The mean increase in CD4+ cell counts was lower in the HCV-positive group during the first year of therapy.

This study explores the association of differentiation profiles of HIV-specific and total memory CD8(+) T cells with viral set point. A cohort of 47 HIV-1-infected individuals, with differing viral set points at 12 mo, were recruited during acute infection. We identified that the magnitude of IFN-gamma(+) T cell responses at 6 mo postinfection did not associate with viral set point at 12 mo. A subset of 16 individuals was further studied to characterize CD8(+) T cells for expression patterns of markers for memory differentiation, survival (CD127), senescence (CD57), and negative regulation (programmed death-1). We show that viral control and the predicted tempo of HIV disease progression in the first year of infection was associated with a synchronous differentiation of HIV-specific and total CD8(+) memory subpopulations. At 6-9 mo postinfection, those with low viral set points had a significantly higher proportion of early differentiated HIV-specific and total memory CD8(+) cells of a central memory (CD45RO(+)CD27(+)CCR7(+)) and intermediate memory (CD45RO(-)CD27(+)CCR7(-)) phenotype. Those with high viral set points possessed significantly larger frequencies of effector memory (CD45RO(+)CD27(-)CCR7(-)) cells. The proportions of memory subsets significantly correlated with CD38(+)CD8(+) T cells. Thus, it is likely that a high Ag burden resulting in generalized immune activation may drive differentiation of HIV-specific and total memory CD8(+) T cells."

In this study, HLA class I types from residents of China with acute HIV-1 infection, diagnosed between 2006 and 2011, were identified and the association between expression of individual HLA alleles and the level of the set point viral load was analyzed. A lower level of set point viral load was found to be associated with the Bw4 homozygote on HLA-B alleles. B*44 and B*57 alleles have also been found to be associated with lower set point viral load. The set point viral load of B*44-positive individuals homozygous for Bw4 was significantly lower than that of B*44-negative individuals homozygous for Bw4 (P = 0.030). The CD4 count declined to <350 in fewer B*44-positive individuals than B*44-negative individuals (X(2) = 7.295, P = 0.026). B*44-positive individuals had a lower magnitude of p24 pool-specific T cell responses than B*44-negative individuals homozygous for Bw4, though this was not statistically significant. The p24 pool-specific T cell responses were also inversely correlated with lower viral load (rs = -0.88, P = 0.033). Six peptides within p24 were recognized to induce the specific-T cell response in B*44-positive individuals, and the peptide breadth of response was same as that in B*44-negative individuals homozygous for Bw4, but the median magnitude of specific-T cell responses to the recognized peptides in B*44-positive individuals was lower than that in B*44-negative individuals homozygous for Bw4 (P = 0.049). These findings imply that weak p24-specific CD8(+) T cell responses might play an important role in the control of HIV viremia in B*44 allele-positive individuals. Such studies might contribute to the development of future therapeutic strategies that take into account the genetic background of the patients. "

Five of the 9 (55.5%) HBsAg-negative recipients in group 1 became positive after receiving HBsAg-positive marrow. Serum HBV DNA was positive in all 5 donors of these patients, but in none of the donors of recipients who remained HBsAg negative (P =.008). Group 1 patients developing HBV-related hepatitis posttransplant were more likely to have a donor carrying a precore A(1896 )and/or core promoter T(1762)/A(1764) HBV variant (62. 5% versus 0%, P =.007). This study has demonstrated that a high incidence of HBV-related hepatitis was associated with the use of HBsAg-positive marrow for transplant, and a high viral load in the donor appeared to predispose recipients to the development of HBV-related hepatitis posttransplant. Further clinical trials will be necessary to determine the optimal management approach to this problem, including the use of the antiviral agents in the donors and the recipients.

We hypothesized that the increased expression of select type 1 IFN and TRIM isoforms is associated with a significantly lower likelihood of HIV-1 acquisition and viral control during primary HIV-1 infection. We measured IFN-α, IFN-β, myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA), human TRIM5α (huTRIM5α), and TRIM22 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of high-risk, HIV-1-uninfected participants and HIV-1-positive study participants. Samples were available for 32 uninfected subjects and 28 infected persons, all within 1 year of infection. HIV-1-positive participants had higher levels of IFN-β (P = 0.0005), MxA (P = 0.007), and TRIM22 (P = 0.01) and lower levels of huTRIM5α (P < 0.001) than did HIV-1-negative participants. TRIM22 but not huTRIM5α correlated positively with type 1 IFN (IFN-α, IFN-β, and MxA) (all P < 0.0001). In a multivariate model, increased MxA expression showed a significant positive association with viral load (P = 0.0418). Furthermore, TRIM22 but not huTRIM5α, IFN-α, IFN-β, or MxA showed a negative correlation with plasma viral load (P = 0.0307) and a positive correlation with CD4(+) T-cell counts (P = 0.0281). In vitro studies revealed that HIV infection induced TRIM22 expression in PBMCs obtained from HIV-negative donors. Stable TRIM22 knockdown resulted in increased HIV-1 particle release and replication in Jurkat reporter cells. Collectively, these data suggest concordance between type 1 IFN and TRIM22 but not huTRIM5α expression in PBMCs and that TRIM22 likely acts as an antiviral effector in vivo."

Activated platelets (PLTs) play an important role in both thrombosis and inflammation, and HIV has been shown to induce PLT activation by both direct and indirect mechanisms. P-selectin (CD62P) is a well-described marker of PLT activation, and PLT glycoprotein (GP) IV (CD36) has been identified as a marker of PLT aggregation. Data on PLT function in the context of HIV infection remain inconclusive. Laboratory techniques, such as flow cytometry, enable the assessment of PLTs in their physiological state and environment, with minimal artifactual in vitro activation and aggregation. In this study, we describe a novel flow cytometry PLT assay, which enabled the measurement of PLT function in HIV infection. Forty-one antiretroviral-naïve HIV-positive individuals and 41 HIV-negative controls were recruited from a clinic in the Western Cape. Platelet function was evaluated by assessing the response of platelets to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at two concentrations (0.04 mM, 0.2 mM). The percentage expression and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD62P and CD36 was used to evaluate platelet function. These were then correlated with platelet (PLT) count; CD4 count; % CD38/8; viral load and D-dimers. The % CD62P levels were higher in HIV-positive patients (HIV % CD62P 11.33[5.96-29.36] vs. control 2.48[1.56-6.04]; p < 0.0001). In addition, the HIV group showed higher CD62P MFI levels (HIV CD62P MFI 3.25 ± 7.23 vs. control 2.35 ± 1.31, p = 0.0292). Baseline levels of %CD36 expression were significantly higher in HIV-positive patients (%CD36 12.41[6.31-21.83] vs. control 6.04[1.34-13.15]; p = 0.0091). However, the baseline CD36MFI showed no significant difference between the two groups (HIV CD36 MFI 3.09 ± 0.64 vs. control 2.44 ± 0.11, p = 0.4591). The HIV group showed higher levels of % CD36 expression post stimulation with 0.04 mM ADP 43.32 ± 27.41 vs. control 27.47 ± 12.95; p < 0.0214) and no significant difference at 0.2 mM ADP (HIV % CD36 39.06 ± 17.91 vs. control 44.61 ± 18.76; p = 0.3277). Furthermore, the HIV group showed a single phase response to ADP as compared to the control group, which showed a normal biphasic response. We concluded that PLT flow cytometry is valuable in the assessment of levels of PLT activation, and further, that the addition of an endogenous agonist, such as ADP, enabled the measurement of PLT function in HIV infection. We were able to show that, although PLTs are significantly activated in HIV compared to uninfected controls, they retain their functional capacity."

This study analysed virus variability in four cases of maternal primary infection occurring during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding. Estimated time of seroconversion was at 4 months of pregnancy for one woman (early seroconversion) and during the last months of pregnancy and/or breastfeeding for the remaining three (late seroconversion). The C2V3 envelope region was analysed in samples of mother-child pairs by molecular cloning and sequencing. Comparisons of nucleotide and amino acid sequences as well as phylogenetic analysis were performed. The results showed low variability in the virus population of both mother and child. Maximum-likelihood analysis showed that, in the early pregnancy seroconversion case, a minor viral variant with further evolution in the child was transmitted, which could indicate a selection event in MTCT or a stochastic event, whereas in the late seroconversion cases, the mother's and child's sequences were intermingled, which is compatible with the transmission of multiple viral variants from the mother's major population. These results could be explained by the less pronounced selective pressure exerted by the immune system in the early stages of the mother's infection, which could play a role in MTCT of HIV-1."

Here we identified an underlying mechanism. Significantly elevated plasma levels of anti-CD4 immunoglobulin G (IgG) were found in HIV-positive immunologic nonresponders (ie, HIV-positive individuals with CD4+ T-cell counts of ≤350 cells/μL), compared with levels in HIV-positive immunologic responders (ie, HIV-positive individuals with CD4+ T-cell counts of ≥500 cells/μL) and healthy controls. Higher plasma level of anti-CD4 IgG correlated with blunted CD4+ T-cell recovery. Furthermore, purified anti-CD4 IgG from HIV-positive immunologic nonresponders induced natural killer (NK) cell-dependent CD4+ T-cell cytolysis and apoptosis through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. We also found that anti-CD4 IgG-mediated ADCC exerts greater apoptosis of naive CD4+ T cells relative to memory CD4+ T cells. Consistently, increased frequencies of CD107a+ NK cells and profound decreases of naive CD4+ T cells were observed in immunologic nonresponders as compared to responders and healthy controls ex vivo. These data indicate that autoreactive anti-CD4 IgG may play an important role in blunted CD4+ T-cell reconstitution despite effective ART."

Using data from a prospective cohort of HIV-infected adults with alcohol problems, we assessed the effects of HCV on pain that interfered with daily living and painful symptoms (muscle/joint pain, headache and peripheral neuropathy). Exploratory analyses assessed whether depressive symptoms and inflammatory cytokines mediated the relationship between HCV and pain. HCV-infected participants (n = 200) had higher odds of pain that interfered with daily living over time (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.43; 95% CI: 1.02-2.01; p = 0.04) compared to those not infected with HCV. HIV/HCV co-infected participants had higher odds of muscle or joint pain (AOR 1.45; 95% CI: 1.06-1.97; p = 0.02) and headache (AOR 1.57; 95% CI: 1.18-2.07; p<0.01). The association between HCV and peripheral neuropathy did not reach statistical significance (AOR 1.33; 95% CI: 0.96-1.85; p = 0.09). Depressive symptoms and inflammatory cytokines did not appear to mediate the relationship between HCV and pain. Adults with HIV who are also co-infected with HCV are more likely to experience pain that interfered with daily living, muscle or joint pain, and headaches compared to those not co-infected. Research is needed to explore the association between HCV infection and pain, and to determine whether HCV treatment is an effective intervention."

It is known to have an aggressive course in significantly immunosuppressed patients, and cirrhosis C has become one of the main causes of mortality in HIV-HCV coinfected patients since the improvement of antiretroviral therapy. The reasons for this severe fibrotic evolution are unclear. This prospective study compared chronic HCV lesions, liver immunocompetent cells, fibrosis and liver HCV loads in 2 cohorts of naive patients referred for HCV treatment: 33 HIV-HCV coinfected patients with CD4 >250/microL and 33 HCV-infected patients matched for the main risk factors of fibrosis. Fibrosis, particularly perisinusoidal fibrosis, was more marked in the coinfected patients. This occurred in the absence of a significant difference in disease activity. The number of CD3+ cells in the liver was higher in the HIV-HCV patients than in the HCV patients. Conversely, the number of liver CD4+ cells was lower in HIV-HCV patients than in HCV patients. The numbers of CD8+ and CD68+ cells were similar in the 2 groups. Finally, liver HCV load, assessed by immunostaining and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, was similar in the 2 groups. We conclude that in the population of HIV-HCV coinfected patients with low-level immunosuppression referred for HCV treatment, fibrosis is worse than in HCV patients and the proportion of CD4+ lymphocytes among CD3+ cells is markedly decreased in the liver, whereas intrahepatic viral load is similar. Our data confirm the need to treat such patients against HCV, and suggest that HIV infection could favor fibrosis via the modulation of the intrahepatic immune response."

Our objective was to test whether this, and other polymorphisms previously related to fatty liver disease in HIV infection linked to SAMM50 or LPPR4 genes, influence liver fibrosis progression in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals. Three hundred and thirty two HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who consecutively attended four Spanish university hospitals from November 2011 to July 2013 were included. A liver stiffness cut-off of 14.6 kPa, as determined by transient elastography, was used to diagnose cirrhosis. Liver stiffness progression was studied in 171 individuals who had two available LS determinations without anti-HCV treatment between them. Moreover, 28 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who underwent liver transplant, as well as 19 non-cirrhotic coinfected individuals used as controls, were included in an additional study. Only rs738409 was associated with cirrhosis: 45 (29.6%) of 152 G allele carriers versus 36 (20.0%) of 180 CC carriers showed cirrhosis (multivariate p = 0.018; adjusted odds ratio = 1.98; 95% confidence interval = 1.12-3.50). Also, 21 (30.4%) of 69 G allele carriers versus 16 (15.7%) of 102 CC patients showed significant liver stiffness progression (adjusted p-value = 0.015; adjusted odds ratio = 2.89; 95% confidence interval = 1.23-6.83). Finally, the proportion of rs738409 G allele carriers was significantly higher in transplanted individuals than in controls (p = 0.044, odds ratio = 3.43; 95% confidence interval = 1.01-11.70).

These responses are governed by the host's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type, and HLA-restricted viral escape mutants are a critical aspect of this host-virus interaction. We examined the driving forces of HCV evolution by characterizing the in vivo selective pressure(s) exerted on single amino acid residues within nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) by the HLA types present in two host populations. Associations between polymorphisms within NS3 and HLA class I alleles were assessed in 118 individuals from Western Australia and Switzerland with chronic hepatitis C infection, of whom 82 (69%) were coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus. The levels and locations of amino acid polymorphisms exhibited within NS3 were remarkably similar between the two cohorts and revealed regions under functional constraint and selective pressures. We identified specific HCV mutations within and flanking published epitopes with the correct HLA restriction and predicted escaped amino acid. Additional HLA-restricted mutations were identified that mark putative epitopes targeted by cell-mediated immune responses. This analysis of host-virus interaction reveals evidence of HCV adaptation to HLA class I-restricted immune pressure and identifies in vivo targets of cellular immune responses at the population level."
11552,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"It has been reported in the literature that biological membranes arising from HIV-induced cell fusion, as well as syncytium formation between infected and non-infected cells and those involved in transduction, viral DNA nuclear import and virion budding from the host cell, are all made of proteins, a phospholipid (P) bilayer and cholesterol (C). However, the P/C molar ratio is higher in the retroviral envelope than in the plasma membrane where they originate, and higher than in the nuclear envelope. Mechanisms are described which elucidate this puzzling fact, as well as cholesterol-dependent leakage and pore formation during cell fusion. Fatty acylation of viral and host cell proteins is required to direct them to membranes. Detergent-insoluble microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, termed either DIGs (detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched complexes), DRMs (detergent resistant membranes), TIFFs (Triton-insoluble floating fractions) or GEMs (glycolipid-enriched membranes), function as platforms for attachment of proteins in the process of signal transduction. HIV-SUgp120 (HIV-surface glycoprotein), T-cell receptor (TCR)-CD4+ and co-receptors promote aggregation of these lipid ""rafts"" which concentrate the Src family tyrosine kinases SFKs (PTK, Lyn, Fyn, Lck), GPI (glycosyl phosphatidylinositol)-anchored proteins, and phosphatidylinositol kinases PI(3)K and PI(4)K, inducing cell signalling. HIV-SUgp120 transduces the activation signal and provokes the formation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites, i.e. the prostaglandin PGE2 suppressor of immune function and inhibitor of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) proliferation, while PGB2 activates SFKs and increases mRNA expression, as well as NFkappaB (nuclear transcription factor) translocation to nucleus. HIV nuclear import, DNA integration, chromatin template capacity may be mediated by the lipid environment. The lipid-enriched microdomains from which HIV-1 buds, may explain the high level of cholesterol and sphingolipids in the viral envelope, since host cell rafts become a viral coat. HIV-1 infection induces alteration of cellular lipids: (1) shift in phospholipid synthesis to neutral lipids associated with the viral load, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) peroxidation, and n-3 deficiency with deregulation of cytokines and PPAR-gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma), and (2) alloimmune phospholipid antibody production in which antibodies to cardiolipin and to phosphatidylserine are most prevalent, due to the destruction of mitochondrial membranes and progression of lymphocyte apoptosis. The current highly active anti-retroviral therapy, including both viral reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs, nucleoside and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors) and protease inhibitors (PIs), induces side-effects in the long term. Lipodystrophy (LD), consists of peripheral lipoatrophy associated with central fat accumulation (called ""crixbelly"" and ""buffalo hump""), insulin resistance, elevation of very low density lipoproteins, decrease in high density lipoproteins and inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. LD syndrome appears to be induced by PIs that inhibit GLUT4, glucose transporter isoform, and by NRTIs which provoke mitochondrial failure. New therapeutic strategies assessed: (1) inhibition of the viral integrase and/or HIV entry into cells through natural products or their derivatives, (2) inhibition of HIV-1 entry into macrophages pretreated with Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide, (3) vaccination with multi-lipopeptides, i.e. sequences of HIV-1 peptides with CD4+ T-cell and B-cell epitopes, modified by adding a lipid tail to one end, which produce HIV-specific CTL and multispecific immune responses in most of the vaccinated subjects and (4) stimulation of antiviral drug activity with lipid-prodrugs targeting viral RT, polymerase, integrase, or aspartyl-protease."

We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in HIV-infected women in South Africa. Asymptomatic HIV-positive women aged 18-25 years (N=120) were stratified by CD4⁺ T-cell count and randomised (1:1) to receive HPV-16/18 vaccine (Cervarix®; GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines) or placebo (Al[OH]3) at 0, 1 and 6 months (double-blind). HIV-negative women (N=30) received HPV-16/18 vaccine (open label). Anti-HPV-16/18 antibody and CD4⁺ T-cell responses, CD4⁺ T-cell count, HIV viral load, HIV clinical stage and safety were evaluated for 12 months. The safety and reactogenicity profile of the HPV-16/18 vaccine was comparable in HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. Irrespective of baseline HPV status, all HIV-positive and HIV-negative women who received the HPV-16/18 vaccine were seropositive for both HPV-16 and HPV-18 after the second vaccine dose (month 2) and remained seropositive for both antigens at month 12. Anti-HPV-16/18 antibody titres at month 12 remained substantially above levels associated with natural infection. The HPV-16/18 vaccine induced sustained anti-HPV-16/18 CD4⁺ T-cell responses in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. No impact of baseline CD4⁺ T-cell count or HIV viral load was observed on the magnitude of the immune response in HIV-positive women. In HIV-positive women, CD4⁺ T-cell count, HIV viral load and HIV clinical stage were unaffected by HPV-16/18 vaccine administration. In conclusion, the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine appears immunogenic and well-tolerated in women with HIV infection. Study ID: 107863/NCT00586339."

During the first year of HAART, 16 cases experienced an AIDS-defining event and 6 experienced an evolution of T CD4(+) cell count <100/mm(3). Forty-four controls who did not progress during the same follow-up period were matched for age, baseline CD4(+), and HIV-RNA. In the control group, plasma levels of TNF-alpha and its soluble receptor p75 decreased significantly from baseline to month 4: from 11.0 to 8.7 pg/ml (p < 0.001) and from 27.3 to 22.8 pg/ml (p < 0.003), respectively. Furthermore the decrease of TNF-alpha soluble receptor p75 was larger in nonprogressors than in progressors (p = 0.003). Measurement of TNF-alpha soluble receptor p75 may be of interest as an additional marker of early antiretroviral effect."

We evaluated a cohort of 180 patients naïve for antiretroviral therapy before the beginning of treatment and after a virological response in order to define the indicators correlated with HIV DNA load decrease until undetectability. The following variables were evaluated as continuous variables: age, CD4 cell count and log(10) HIV DNA level at baseline and follow-up, and baseline log(10) HIV RNA level. Primary HIV infection at the start of therapy, an HIV RNA level at follow-up of <2.5 copies/ml, origin, gender, and transmission risk were evaluated as binary variables. The decline of HIV DNA values during effective therapy was directly related to baseline HIV DNA and HIV RNA values, to an increase in the number of CD4 cells, and to the achievement of an HIV RNA load of <2.5 copies/ml. An undetectable cellular HIV DNA load was achieved by 21.6% of patients at the follow-up time point and correlated significantly with lower baseline cellular HIV DNA values and with being in the primary stage of infection when therapy started. In conclusion, early treatment facilitated the achievement of undetectable levels of plasma viremia and cellular HIV DNA and a better recovery of CD4 lymphocytes. HIV DNA levels before and during highly active antiretroviral therapy may be used as a new tool for monitoring treatment efficacy."

Fifteen patients undergoing highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) treatment, with undetectable viral load, but low CD4+ cell count (<300/microl), have been treated with 3.6 M IU Proleukine administered twice daily by subcutaneous injection over 5 days. C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, C3, C9, C1-inh and alpha-2HS glycoprotein levels were measured immediately before IL-2 administration, as well as on day 5 and 2-3 weeks thereafter. After IL-2 administration, both mean D-dimer and CRP levels increased significantly (P<0.001), but returned (P<0.001) to baseline within the subsequent 2-3 weeks. Alpha-2HS glycoprotein decreased immediately after IL-2 administration. No significant differences were detected in the levels of C3, C9 and C1-inh. A significant, positive correlation (r=0.5178, P=0.0008) was ascertained between the changes of CRP level, measured immediately before as well as 5 days after IL-2 administration, and changes in CD4 T cell counts measured 2-3 weeks before and after treatment, respectively. IL-2 administration induces rapid elevation of two major APPs (CRP, D-dimer). The positive correlation observed between the changes of CRP levels and CD4+ cell counts after IL-2 administration may indicate that the abrupt, but transitory overproduction of CRP might contribute to the CD4+ cell count-increasing effect of the drug and/ or may be associated with serious side effects."

HIV-2 infection is considered a ""natural"" model of attenuated HIV disease given its much slower rate of CD4 decline than HIV-1 and limited impact on the survival of the majority of infected adults. We compared untreated HIV-1- and HIV-2-infected patients and found that the HIV-2 cohort demonstrated a delayed increase in IL-7 levels during the progressive depletion of circulating CD4 T cells as well as a dissociation between the acquisition of markers of T cell effector differentiation and the loss of IL-7Ralpha expression. This comparison of two persistent infections associated with progressive CD4 depletion and immune activation demonstrates that a better prognosis is not necessarily associated with higher levels of IL-7. Moreover, the delayed increase in IL-7 coupled with sustained expression of IL-7Ralpha suggests a maximization of available resources in HIV-2. The observation that increased IL-7 levels early in HIV-1 infection were unable to reduce the rate of CD4 loss and the impaired expression of the IL-7Ralpha irrespective of the state of cell differentiation raises concerns regarding the use of IL-7 therapy in HIV-1 infection."

Of 161 subjects, 7% could not correctly identify all their prescribed medications; 11% could identify them but reported never taking at least one medication. The majority (83%) reported taking all of their medications at least some of the time, but only 50% of these subjects reported full adherence. Therefore, only 41% of the sample reported full adherence. A strong association was found between adherence and reduced viral load. A CD4 level of > or = 500 cells/mm3 was also associated with adherence. Higher levels of depression were significantly associated with decreased adherence, and a trend was found for an association between number of medications prescribed and adherence. Strict adherence to HAART is critical for sustained suppression of viral replication allowing for immune recovery and reducing the risk of the selection of antiviral resistance. Adherence appears to be a serious problem among HIV-positive adolescents. Better education, intervention to relieve depression, and efforts to improve ease of medication use are essential."

However, other types of cancer, such as Hodgkin's disease (HD), anal cancer, lung cancer and testicular germ cell tumors appear to be more common among HIV-infected subjects compared to the general population. While not classified as AIDS-defining, these malignancies have been referred to as AIDS-associated malignancies. The mechanisms by which depressed immunity could increase the risk for cancer are unclear, except for in KS and most subtypes of NHL, where it is strictly associated with a low CD4 count. Although it remains unclear whether HIV-1 acts directly as an oncogenic agent, it may contribute to the development of malignancies through several mechanisms (e.g., infection by oncogenic viruses, impaired immune surveillance, imbalance between cellular proliferation and differentiation). Studies of the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the incidence and progression of HIV/AIDS-associated cancers provided contrasting data. While a significant decrease in the incidence of KS has been observed, HAART has not had a significant impact on NHL incidence, particularly systemic NHL, or on ICC, HD, anal cancers and other non-AIDS-defining cancers. Regardless of whether these cancers are directly related to HIV-induced immunodeficiency, treating cancer in HIV-infected patients remains a challenge because of drug interactions, compounded side effects, and the potential effect of chemotherapy on CD4 count and HIV-1 viral load. A better knowledge of viral mechanisms of immune evasion and manipulation will provide the basis for a better management and treatment of the malignancies associated with chronic viral infections."

Our aim was to review the occurrence and clinical course of colorectal (CR) malignancies in HIV infected/AIDS patients from a single institution. A retrospective review of HIV/AIDS patients with colorectal malignant tumors was undertaken. We included adult patients, with ELISA and Western blot test positive for HIV, and primary malignant tumors located in the colon or rectum. Malignant neoplasms of the anus were excluded for the purposes of this study. Twelve patients (9 males and 3 females), mean age 41 years, were identified with the following neoplasm: 6 adenocarcinomas (ACA), 5 non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), and 1 small-cell carcinoma. Intravenous drug abuse was the main risk factor for HIV. No patient had identified risk factors for colorectal neoplasm. Five out of six patients with ACA had metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. One patient with stage II ACA developed early liver metastases after colonic resection. Seven out of 12 patients underwent surgery. Six (85.7%) of these sustained postoperative complications, primarily wound infection. The overall survival in our series was dismal, averaging 20 months. For NHL average survival was 29 months, and 12 months for CR-ACA. This is the largest series of cases of colorectal cancer in the HIV/AIDS patient population published in the English language and the largest number of colorectal ACA reported in this unique population. Early in our experience, tumors frequently found in immunoincompetent patients were detected (NHL). More recently, we have only treated patients with colorectal ACA; none of them had no risk factors for colorectal cancer (family history, IBD, FAP, HNPCC). These patients developed tumors at earlier ages and were diagnosed at an advanced stage. Therefore, these tumors may be associated with the grade of immunosuppression induced during the course of the HIV infection and with a tumorigenic effect of the HIV on the colonic epithelium. Consequently, a high index of suspicion when evaluating chronic abdominal complaints in such patients is warranted. The use of the new antiretroviral therapy regimens should be further evaluated to know its impact in the survival."

The immune responses were evaluated in patients who had participated in randomized trials of therapeutic vaccination. Immunization in conjunction with antiretroviral therapy was effective in inducing HIV-specific T-cell responses. Therapeutic immunizations with recombinant gp160 had a modest effect on CD4-cell counts, the treatment alone lead to a transient clinical benefit in the form of an improved survival after two years of immunization. Immunizations with HIV DNA during HAART treatment permitted persistence or development of innate (NK), CD4+ and/or CD8+ immune responses. HIV specific T-helper cell responses induced by immunization with gp160 were maintained at high levels up to 7 years after the last injection. Cells with HIV-specific interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production were retained or increased in long-term HAART treated patients. The impact of a single structured therapy interruption (STI) was analyzed in a small group of patients showing no obvious increase or decrease in the HIV-specific immune response during or after STI. The possibility to induce very long-term strong and persistent immune responses in HIV-infected individuals raises hopes that vaccination preceding therapy interruption might prolong the symptom-free period without HAART."

They are frequently the first clinical manifestation of HIV infection. The incidence and severity of bacterial lower respiratory tract infections increase with the degree of immunosuppression. At the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) stage, the responsible bacteria and clinical presentation may be atypical. Bacterial pneumonia may be fatal, particularly in AIDS patients, and its occurrence is predictive of a reduced survival time. Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended in patients with a CD4 T-lymphocyte count of > 200 cells mm(-3) and cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) in patients with a CD4 T-lymphocyte count of < 200 cells x mm(-3). Unfortunately, such prophylaxis remains insufficiently prescribed and its protective effect is limited. Highly active antiretroviral treatment has dramatically reduced the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and opportunistic bacteria. In contrast, successful highly active antiretroviral therapy slightly decreased the risk of bacterial pneumonia due to usual bacteria, even in patients on successful highly active antiretroviral therapy."

In the first open label pilot study, the reverse transcriptase inhibitor lamivudine had little demonstrable biochemical or histological effect after 1 year. Whereas, lamivudine in combination with zidovudine was associated with a significant reduction in alkaline phosphatase as well as improvement in necroinflammatory score, cholangitis and ductopenia over a 12 mo period. A double blind, multi-center randomized controlled trial using lamivudine with zidovudine for 6 mo confirmed a significant reduction in alkaline phosphatase, ALT and AST in patients on antiviral therapy. However, none of the patients achieved the stringent endpoint criteria for normalization of alkaline phosphatase. Furthermore, some patients developed biochemical rebound consistent with drug resistance. A major fault of these studies has been the inability to measure the viral load in peripheral blood and therefore, provide a direct correlation between improvement of hepatic biochemistry and reduction in viral load. Nevertheless, viral mutants to lamivudine with zidovudine were later characterized in the NOD.c3c4 mouse model of PBC that has been used to test other antiretroviral regimens to betaretrovirus. The combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the HIV protease inhibitor, lopinavir were found to abrogate cholangitis in the NOD.c3c4 mouse model and the same regimen normalized the liver tests in a PBC patient with HIV and human betaretrovirus infection. This combination antiretroviral therapy has now been used in a double blind randomized controlled crossover study for patients with PBC followed by an open label extension study. Only a third of the PBC patients were able to tolerate the lopinavir but those maintained on tenofovir, emtricitabine and lopinavir experienced sustained and clinically meaningful reduction in hepatic biochemistry. While we await the histological and virological evaluation, it is clear that better tolerated regimens of antiretroviral treatment will be required in future clinical trials."

In vitro, the rtN236T adefovir dipivoxil (ADV)-associated resistance mutation confers low-level cross-resistance to tenofovir: 3- to 13-fold changes in EC(50) from wild type. This study evaluated the clinical response of rtN236T mutant viruses by comparing their early viral load decay kinetics to wild-type viruses in chronic HBV monoinfected patients harbouring rtN236T prior to initiating TDF or emtricitabine (FTC)/TDF therapy. Baseline samples (n = 105) from adefovir refractory patients were tested for the presence of rtN236T using a highly sensitive allele-specific PCR assay with an rtN236T detection cut-off of 0.5%. The rtN236T mutation was detected at baseline in 14.3% (14/98) of analysable patient samples (0.5-93.2%, rtN236T percentage range). The median change in total HBV DNA at week 24 was comparable for patients with rtN236T detected at baseline (-3.7 log(10) copies/mL, n = 14) as compared to patients with wild-type HBV (-3.2 log(10) copies/mL, n = 90). In patients with rtN236T, wild-type and rtN236T mutant virus showed similar rates of HBV DNA decline with no statistically significant difference observed at week 4. Moreover, the proportion of rtN236T remained unchanged in patients in either arm of the study during treatment. In conclusion, the rtN236T mutant virus showed similar HBV DNA decline kinetics to wild-type virus in adefovir refractory patients who switched to TDF or FTC/TDF. Despite low levels of cross-resistance in vitro, TDF similarly suppresses wild-type and rtN236T mutant viruses in vivo."

Of the 2361 individuals studied 1889 were representative of the general population and 472 were from groups at high risk for viral infections: 279 drug users and 193 patients on chronic haemodialysis. All sera were tested for hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb), human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIVAb) and for hepatitis B virus (HBV) serology. Two solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to study the seroepidemiology of HEV IgG, the first (using recombinant antigens) for confirmation of initially reactive samples. The prevalence of circulating hepatitis E virus antibody (HEVAb) was 2.6% in the open population, 5.4% among drug users and 9.3% among patients on chronic haemodialysis. In the open population a positive relationship between age and prevalence of HEVAb was observed. A relationship between presence of HEVAb and serological evidence of previous HBV or HCV infections was also observed in this study. It was concluded that HEV infections are present in north-east Italy and are more frequent among subjects at risk for blood-borne viral infections. The positive correlation, observed in the open population, between age and prevalence of HEVAb suggests the presence of a cohort effect."

Methamphetamine abuse in HIV-1 patients poses a potential risk for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, because methamphetamine and HIV-1 proteins such as transactivator of transcription can synergistically damage the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of methamphetamine and HIV-1 Tat protein on the blood-brain barrier function and to determine whether ginsenoside Rb1 (GsRb1) plays a role in protecting the BBB. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups. The experimental groups received methamphetamine and HIV-1 Tat protein or both and the control group received saline or GsRb1 pretreatment. Oxidative stress-related factors, tight junction (TJ) proteins, blood-brain barrier permeability, and morphological changes were recorded in each group. The results showed that the group treated with Methamphetamine[Formula: see text]Tat showed a significant change at the ultrastructural level and in the levels of oxidative stress-related factors, TJ proteins, and BBB permeability, suggesting that the BBB function was severely damaged by HIV-1 Tat and methamphetamine synergistically. However, malondialdehyde levels and BBB permeability were lower and the oxidative stress-related factors superoxide dismutase and glutathione were higher in the GsRb1-treated group than in the Methamphetamine[Formula: see text]Tat-treated group, indicating that GsRb1 can protect the BBB against the toxic effects of HIV-1 Tat and methamphetamine. These results show that GsRb1 may offer a potential therapeutic option for patients with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders or other neurodegenerative diseases."

The HIV-1 A102-resistant to AZT was serially passaged for 4 months in the presence of increasing concentrations of PMPA up to maximum of 40 microM on the fresh MT-2 cells. After 25 passages, HIV-1 developed decreased sensitivity to PMPA after long-term in vitro exposure. Selected HIV-1 mutants were characterized by decreased susceptibility to PMPA (4-fold). This decrease could be related to PMPA resistant caused by an amino acid change associated with a V148M substitution. From these results, additional studies will be needed to determine whether a similar mutation in HIV RT develops in patients receiving PMPA or its orally bioavailable prodrug, tenofovir dipivoxil fumarate."

The clinical diagnosis of pancreatitis is based on anamnesis, physical examination, radiological, sonographic, endoscopic, and laboratory findings. Nowadays, there is a test for the determination of fecal elastase-1, by enzymatic reaction (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA), which specifically determines human elastase-1, promoting the pancreatic function evaluation. Parameters such as linearity, calibration curve, sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, recovery, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve are used to evaluate the test. The aim of this study was the validation of the immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA) and the use of its results in patients with HIV, alcoholics, and under antiretroviral therapy. The study involved 157 patients, 95 of them were HIV-infected, and 62 were completely healthy. The elastase-1 ELISA kit from Bioserv was used, and we noted that the obtained results were linear, sensitive, precise, and accurate. Moreover, our results suggest that this test can be a laboratory evaluation to determine the relationship of pancreatitis with alcohol use, but not its association with antiretroviral use in HIV patients (P=0.424).

As of May 1999, a total of 65 NBSIs (4.7%) occurred in 1379 admissions, for an incidence of 2.45 NBSIs per 1000 patient-days. Twenty-nine NBSIs were catheter-related bloodstream infections, with a rate of 9.6 central venous catheter-associated infections per 1000 device-days. Multivariate analysis indicated that variables independently associated with NBSIs included active injection drug use, a Karnofsky Performance Status score of <40, presence of a central venous catheter, and length of hospital stay. Mortality rates were 24.6% and 7.2% among patients with and without NBSIs, respectively (P<.00001).

Etiologies of liver disease include viral hepatitis coinfections, drug-related hepatotoxicity, fatty liver disease, and direct and indirect effects from HIV infection, including increased bacterial translocation, immune activation, and presence of soluble proteins, that modulate the hepatic cytokine environment. New treatments for hepatitis C virus (HCV) using direct-acting agents appear viable, though issues related to intrinsic toxicities and drug-drug interactions remain. Recent research suggests that acute HCV infection, unrecognized hepatitis D infection, and hepatitis E may all represent emergent areas of concern. Antiretroviral agents, including those used in recent years, may represent risk factors for hepatic injury and portal hypertension. Key issues in the future include systematic implementation of liver disease management and new treatment in HIV-infected populations with concomitant injection drug use, alcohol use, and low socioeconomic status."

Thus, viral load (VL) is the reference method to evaluate therapy effectiveness. However, even in the presence of efficient HAART viral eradication was yet not achieved. In this study, we analyzed the presence of total HIV DNA (T-HIV DNA), non-integrated DNA with 2LTR (2LTR-HIV DNA) and HIV RNA in a group of 55 HIV-positive subjects from Rosario City, with different clinical stages, with and without HAART. All markers were evaluated by PCR assays optimized in our laboratory that included colorimetric detection in microplate. HIV RNA clinical sensitivity was compared with a reference test, bDNA, resulting in 74% and 64% respectively, with an 85% of agreement. Thus, our HIV RNA assay could be used to monitor patients under HAART and at risk of infection. The 2LTR-HIV DNA was 54% positive although it was absent in patients with high VL. This marker was considered a labile product therefore its presence was associated with recent infection. However, current evidences question its stability. Thus, its clinical significance should be reconsidered. The absence of 2LTR-HIV DNA in patients with detectable VL may relate to the heterogeneity of the sequence used for its detection. T-HIV DNA was present in 100% of the samples and could be a relevant remission marker when therapies that effectively eradicate the infection became available."

We calculated the LPV inhibitory quotient (IQ), and when the IQ was <15, saquinavir (SQV) 750 mg/m(2) p.o. q12h was added to the regimen. We studied 26 HIV-infected patients. The median age was 15 years (range, 7 to 17), with 11.5 prior antiretroviral medications, 197 CD4 cells/ml, viral load of 75,577 copies/ml, and a 133-fold change in LPV resistance. By treatment week 2, 14 patients had a viral-load decrease of >0.75 log(10), with a median maximal decrease in viral load of -1.57 log(10) copies/ml at week 8. At week 2, 19 subjects showed a median LPV area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 157.2 (range, 62.8 to 305.5) microg x h/ml and median LPV trough concentration (C(trough)) of 10.8 (range, 4.1 to 25.3) microg/ml.

At week 24, 18 of 26 (69%) subjects remained in the study. Between weeks 24 and 48, one subject withdrew for nonadherence and nine withdrew for persistently high virus load. In antiretroviral-experienced children and adolescents with HIV, high doses of LPV/r with or without SQV offer safe options for salvage therapy, but the modest virologic response and the challenge of adherence to a regimen with a high pill burden may limit the usefulness of this approach."

Multiple logistic regression analysis of data from NIDUs showed that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection status was the only independent predictor of HCV seroprevalence. Among IDUs, the number of years of drug use and HBV and human immunodeficiency virus infection status were independent predictors of HCV seropositivity. We found an HCV infection prevalence of 20% among NIDUs. This rate was much lower than that for IDUs, who are 11 times more likely to have antibodies against HCV. The prevalence of HCV infection was much higher than that of HBV infection among the IDUs. In contrast, the prevalence of HBV infection was slightly higher than that of HCV infection among unvaccinated NIDUs. The prevalence of HCV infection among long-term IDUs approached true population saturation; among long-term NIDUs, however, it appeared to plateau at approximately 40%.

Once thought of as a death sentence, HIV infection has become a chronically manageable disease. However, it is estimated that a staggering 0.8% of the world's population is infected with HIV, with more than 1 million deaths reported in 2015 alone. Despite the development of effective anti-retroviral drugs, a permanent cure has only been documented in one patient to date. In 2007, an HIV-positive patient received a bone marrow transplant to treat his leukemia from an individual who was homozygous for a mutation in the CCR5 gene. This mutation, known as CCR5Δ32, prevents HIV replication by inhibiting the early stage of viral entry into cells, resulting in resistance to infection from the majority of HIV isolates. More than 10 years after his last dose of anti-retroviral therapy, the transplant recipient remains free of replication-competent virus. Multiple groups are now attempting to replicate this success through the use of other CCR5-negative donor cell sources. Additionally, developments in the use of lentiviral vectors and targeted nucleases have opened the doors of precision medicine and enabled new treatment methodologies to combat HIV infection through targeted ablation or down-regulation of CCR5 expression. Here, we review historical cases of CCR5-edited cell-based therapies, current clinical trials and future benefits and challenges associated with this technology."

However, whether CD4-independent viruses may also exist in HIV-1-infected patients has remained unclear. We have recently reported the isolation of viruses from an AIDS patient that were able to infect CD8(+) cells independent of CD4, using CD8 as a receptor. Using a similar approach, here we examined viruses from 12 randomly selected patients (obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Program, National Institutes of Health) for the presence of CD4-independent HIV-1. CD4-independent variants were isolated from infected CD8(+) cells from the viral quasispecies of 7 of 12 patients. The CD4-independent isolates were able to infect primary CD8(+) cells as well as a CD4(-) CD8(+) T-cell line. Soluble CD4 and blocking anti-CD4 or -CD8 antibody had no effect on infection of CD8(+) cells. Remarkably, two of the seven CD4-independent isolates, but not their parental bulk viruses, induced syncytia and caused acute death of infected CD8(+) cells. Some of the CD4-independent variants were also able to infect U87 cells that were negative for CD4, CD8, and common HIV coreceptors, suggesting a novel entry mechanism for these isolates. The CD4-independent isolates were derived from adults and children infected with subtypes A, B, and D. Although no common motif for CD4 independence was found, novel sequence changes were observed in critical areas of the envelopes of the CD4-independent viruses. These results demonstrate that HIV-1-infected patients can frequently harbor viruses that are able to mediate CD4-independent infection of CD8(+) cells. In addition, this study also provides evidence of primary HIV-1 variants that are syncytium inducing and acutely cytopathic for CD8(+) lymphocytes."

The 3-year patient and graft survival rates were 60% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 47%-71%] and 53% (95% CI = 40%-64%) for the HCV/HIV patients and 79% (95% CI = 72%-84%) and 74% (95% CI = 66%-79%) for the HCV-infected recipients (P < 0.001 for both), and HIV infection was the only factor significantly associated with reduced patient and graft survival. Among the HCV/HIV patients, older donor age [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.3 per decade], combined kidney-liver transplantation (HR = 3.8), an anti-HCV-positive donor (HR = 2.5), and a body mass index < 21 kg/m(2) (HR = 3.2) were independent predictors of graft loss. For the patients without the last 3 factors, the patient and graft survival rates were similar to those for US LT recipients. The 3-year incidence of treated acute rejection was 1.6-fold higher for the HCV/HIV patients versus the HCV patients (39% versus 24%, log rank P = 0.02), but the cumulative rates of severe HCV disease at 3 years were not significantly different (29% versus 23%, P = 0.21). In conclusion, patient and graft survival rates are lower for HCV/HIV-coinfected LT patients versus HCV-monoinfected LT patients. Importantly, the rates of treated acute rejection (but not the rates of HCV disease severity) are significantly higher for HCV/HIV-coinfected recipients versus HCV-infected recipients. Our results indicate that HCV per se is not a contraindication to LT in HIV patients, but recipient and donor selection and the management of acute rejection strongly influence outcomes."

This study tested whether HIV-associated cognitive impairment (CI) and low health literacy reduced adherence to routine HIV medical and phlebotomy visits and if social support and patient-provider relationship conferred a protective effect. Participants were 210 HIV-infected patients enrolled in outpatient care and followed for 28-weeks. Results showed that those attending >75 % of phlebotomy visits were more likely to be virally suppressed. Health literacy was unassociated with adherence to medical or phlebotomy visits. CI was not directly related to medical or phlebotomy visit adherence; however those with CI and greater use of social support were less likely to miss medical visits. Utilizing social support may be an effective means of managing visit adherence, especially among patients with CI."

This study examined the relationship of perceived emotional or informational social support from family and friends, quality of physician-patient communications and relationships, and medication adherence in a sample of low-income, Spanish-speaking, HIV-positive Latino men and women receiving treatment in community-based clinics (n = 85). Results of the study indicated that, whereas emotional or informational support was significantly associated with level of dose adherence (OR, 1.04, 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; p = .03), quality of physician-patient communications or relationships was significantly associated with adherence to medication schedule,t(6, 71) = 4.45,p < .001.

This study is a theory-based examination of racial differences in patient-perceived barriers and reported ARV adherence. Participants (N=149) completed the Patient Medication Adherence Questionnaire (PMAQ), measuring adherence and perceived barriers to adherence. Adherence was defined as a self-report of 100% adherence in the past four weeks. Odds ratios were calculated to determine the relation of reported barriers to adherence for race and gender groups, and for the sample overall. For every ten-point increase in barrier score, there was an 86% increased risk of being non-adherent (OR=1.86; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.91). Adherence was not different between racial and gender groups, nor was total barrier score. However, individual barriers were differentially endorsed across groups. Rather than relying on demographic predictors, which may be only an indirect marker of adherence, evaluations of adherence should examine the psychological and social barriers to positive adherence outcomes in individual patients. Our findings support the use of theory-based behavioural interventions that address perceived barriers to adherence and other health promotion activities."

All patients received ART at or after receiving anti-TB treatment. Clinical manifestations, treatment regimens and outcomes were analyzed. Of 101 patients, 62 (61.4%) completed TB treatment. Of these, 53.2% were treated with a 6-month standard TB regimen, while the rest were treated with prolonged TB regimens. The median interval between anti-TB treatment and ART was 68 days (range: 0-381). Among the clinically cured patients 66.1% received rifampin concomitantly with nevirapine, and 32.3% received rifampin concomitantly with efavirenz. The treatment success rate was 75.6%, with a mortality rate of 6.1%. The risk factors for death were resistant TB (p = 0.03) and poor compliance (p < 0.05). Seven point nine percent had multi-drug resistant TB. Possible or probable immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was seen in 15 cases (14.9%). No life-threatening IRIS was reported, and it did not affect disease outcome (p = 0.5). A shorter time between anti-TB treatment and ART onset was associated with the occurrence of IRIS (31 days vs 90 days; p < 0.05). Regarding adverse drug effects, 44.6% had side effects due either to anti-TB drugs or ART. Sixty-six point one percent of them occurred within the first 2 months of TB treatment, and 43 (76.8%) had to stop or change either anti-TB treatment or ART.

A total of 1981 consecutive hospital admissions in 1581 different HIV-infected patients were analyzed. Nearly half of them (45%) were on ARV therapy. Overall, ARV-related toxicities were the main or secondary reason for hospital admission in 141 patients (7%). Liver toxicity was the most frequent complication (n = 42; 30%), of which one-third were associated with NVP use and 80% occurred in subjects with underlying chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Other main ARV-related toxicities were bone marrow toxicity due to zidovudine (17%), pancreatitis (13%), and indinavirassociated nephrolithiasis (6%). Eight patients presented with symptomatic hyperlactatemia, two of them with lactic acidosis.

These emergencies could be related to opportunistic infections that are seen at presentation or that occur as the immune system gets weaker, or may bedue to HIV itself per se. The emergencies could also result from use of antiretroviral drugs like lactic acidosis, pancreatitis, bone marrow suppression and may include the immune reconstitution syndromes. The emergencies due to the opportunistic conditions and HIV per se had been dealt with in detail in the part 1, and this part describes various emergencies that could be encountered due to the administration of the anti retroviral treatment.

However, the development of clinical symptoms secondary to previously silent opportunistic pathogens shortly after beginning HAART has been reported as a distinct clinical syndrome and seems to be associated with inflammatory phenomena surrounding a rapid restoration of the immune system in previously immunosuppressed patients. Herein, we report nine (3.6%) episodes of opportunistic infections (OI) in 247 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients undergoing HAART in a reference HIV/AIDS institution located in Madrid, Spain. In all instances, OI clustered within the first 3 months after beginning HAART. Episodes of cerebral toxoplasmosis (three cases), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (two cases), and herpes zoster (two cases) occurred in persons without a previous AIDS-defining illness, in addition a relapse of cytomegalovirus retinitis and a rebound in Kaposi's sarcoma were seen, respectively, in another two patients. Four of the nine subjects had a CD4 count above 200 cells/mm3 before HAART began. Of these, one developed Pneumocystis pneumonia and one other cerebral toxoplasmosis.

This study aimed to assess the outcome of a prospective Spanish nationwide cohort of HIV-infected patients undergoing LT for HCC (2002-2014). These patients were matched (age, gender, year of LT, center, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus infection) with non-HIV-infected controls (1:3 ratio). Patients with incidental HCC were excluded. Seventy-four HIV-infected patients and 222 non-HIV-infected patients were included. All patients had cirrhosis, mostly due to HCV infection (92%). HIV-infected patients were younger (47 versus 51 years) and had undetectable HCV RNA at LT (19% versus 9%) more frequently than non-HIV-infected patients. No significant differences were detected between HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected recipients in the radiological characteristics of HCC at enlisting or in the histopathological findings for HCC in the explanted liver. Survival at 1, 3, and 5 years for HIV-infected versus non-HIV-infected patients was 88% versus 90%, 78% versus 78%, and 67% versus 73% (P = 0.779), respectively.

HIV infection raises plasma HCV RNA levels and diminishes the response to exogenous alpha interferon (IFN). The degree to which antiretroviral therapy (ART) control of infection overcomes these HIV effects is unknown. Participants with HIV-HCV coinfection were enrolled in a trial to measure HCV viral kinetics after IFN administration (ΔHCVIFN ) twice: initially before (pre-ART) and then after (post-ART) HIV RNA suppression. Liver tissue was obtained 2-4 hours before each IFN injection to measure interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Following ART, the ΔHCVIFN at 72 hours (ΔHCVIFN,72 ) increased in 15/19 (78.9%) participants by a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 0.11 log10 IU/mL (0.00-0.40; P < 0.05). Increases in ΔHCVIFN,72 post-ART were associated with decreased hepatic expression of several ISGs (r = -0.68; P = 0.001); a 2-fold reduction in a four-gene ISG signature predicted an increase in ΔHCVIFN,72 of 0.78 log10 IU/mL (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36,1.20). Pre- and post-ART ΔHCVIFN,72 were closely associated (r = 0.87; P < 0.001).

Data from 1,938 young sexually active women who lived in five U.S. cities where the risk for human immunodeficiency virus is high were analyzed by using logistic, ordinal, and multiple linear regression analysis. For the pros scale of condom use, 27% of the women had low scores, and 33% had moderate scores. For the cons scale, 27% had moderate scores, and 5% had high scores. Of the total, 47% had a negative score on the decisional balance measure. Older age, living with a spouse or partner, or binge drinking was associated with lower pros scores and with a negative score on the decisional balance measure. Income from public assistance was associated with higher pros scores. Income from a spouse or partner or a history of sexually transmitted disease was associated with lower pros scores. Multiple sex partners or being at risk for HIV infection (based on perceptions of the main partner's behaviors) was associated with higher cons scores. Income from a job was associated with a positive score on the decisional balance measure. Our analysis identified the characteristics of women who have low pros scores, high cons scores, and negative decisional balance scores. The regression results can inform our work in HIV prevention on whether to focus on the pros, the cons, or both to obtain positive decisional balance scores and increase condom use in situations that warrant protective behaviors."
17976,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The choice of initial antiretroviral regimen for treating people infected with HIV is crucial to successful long-term control of virus replication. Potent antiretroviral therapy substantially suppresses viral replication as measured by plasma HIV RNA levels to below limits of detection: the current standard of care is usually a combination of at least three drugs and frequently includes a protease inhibitor, or alternatively a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nnRTI). Patients who have low CD4+ cell counts (< or = 200 CD4+ cells/mm3) or high plasma HIV RNA levels (> or = 100,000 copies/ml) may not attain maximal suppression of HIV replication when treated with current regimens and may require more aggressive therapy. In contrast, patients with relatively normal CD4+ cell counts and low to non-measurable levels of plasma HIV RNA over prolonged periods (i.e., slow or non-progressors) may not require immediate antiretroviral therapy. These individuals should reconsider treatment when either the CD4+ cell count declines or the HIV RNA level increases. Early and potent antiretroviral therapy should provide more durable virological and clinical benefits for many patients, especially if they receive sufficient counselling and support to aid adherence to the treatment regimen. The optimum time to initiate antiretroviral therapy is not well established, but to maximise the recovery of the immune system and the virological and clinical benefits, initiation of therapy is generally recommended for individuals who have symptoms or those with plasma HIV RNA levels > 5000-10,000 copies/ml, or CD4+ cell counts < 500 cells/mm3. The current choice of initial antiretroviral regimens includes two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nRTI) with a potent, well-tolerated HIV-1 protease inhibitor or nnRTI. Recent short-term activity data (24-week comparative clinical trial data) indicate that regimens combining three nRTI, including abacavir, could also be considered. Other emerging combination regimens for consideration include two HIV-1 protease inhibitors with one or two nRTI, or a combination of drugs from all current categories (e.g., nRTI with a nnRTI and HIV-1 protease inhibitor). The goal of antiretroviral therapy is to maximise suppression of HIV replication and thereby prevent or delay viral resistance, restore immunological function and improve clinical outcome. Since evolution of the virus towards resistance can occur with plasma HIV RNA levels between 50 and 500 copies/ml, current standards for best suppression of HIV replication have shifted to declines in plasma HIV RNA to < 50 copies/ml. In addition, non-adherence to any regimen is associated with the greatest risk for virological failure. Therefore, both the decision to initiate therapy and the choice of initial therapy should be carefully weighted and balanced with the long-term implications of antiretroviral therapy."

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) have been considered to be highly specific for systemic small vessel vasculitides with renal involvement. The prevalence, nature, a clinical significance of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in serum samples of patients with HCV were therefore investigated. A prospective study of 67 consecutive patients with chronic HCV with no evidence of previous hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or any other autoimmune disorder. Twenty-seven patients with HBV and 35 healthy volunteers matched for age and sex served as control groups. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in the serum samples were measured by indirect immunofluorescence assay. The group of patients with HCV and ANCA in their serum showed significantly higher total IgG levels, a higher incidence of antinuclear antibodies, and viraemia (HCV RNA) than the ANCA negative patients. None of the patients with HCV and ANCA showed any clinical manifestations related to those autoantibodies. This study clearly shows a high prevalence of ANCA in the serum of patients with HCV. The role of these autoantibodies on the course of HCV infection and their clinical significance has not been determined yet. In conclusion, ANCA are not only markers of small vessel vasculitides, but can also be (false?) positive in patients with HCV infection. A hepatitis C associated vasculitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Determination of target antigens for ANCA is indispensable. Interpretation and therapeutic decisions concerning ANCA associated HCV should only be performed within the clinical context."

The cumulative incidence of non-adherence was 36.9%. Three pure vulnerability profiles (lower, medium and higher) were identified based on the Grade of Membership method (GoM). Pure type patients of the ""higher vulnerability"" profile had, when compared to the overall sample, an increased probability of being younger, not understanding the need of ART, having a personal reason to be HIV-tested, not disclosing their HIV status, having more than one (non-regular) sexual partner, reporting use of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs, and having sex among men. Non-adherence to ART was statistically associated (p < 0.001) with this profile. Also, the heterogeneity of the sample was found to be high, since over 40% were mixed type. The implications are that health staff should be trained to develop strategies for incorporating risk-reduction interventions, bearing in mind the three dimensions of vulnerability and the diversity of those patients initiating antiretroviral therapy."

However, presence of resistance mutations did not affect the increase in plasma HIV-1 RNA during a 5-week drug washout, nor was there any effect on first-phase virus decay rates after initiation of therapy or on the probability of having plasma HIV-1 RNA levels <100 copies/mL at week 48. Polymorphisms at protease codons 10, 36, and 71 were associated with significantly faster second-phase decay rates. Suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA despite presence of zidovudine resistance mutations implies that the presence of these mutations does not preclude a durable response to treatment with a potent 3-drug regimen."

Plasma viral load is a key determinant of disease progression and infectiousness in HIV infection. Although HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C) is the predominant virus in the AIDS epidemic worldwide, the relationship between HIV-1C-specific T-cell immune responses and plasma viral load has not been elucidated. In the present study we address (i) the association between the level of plasma viral load and virus-specific immune responses to different HIV-1C proteins and their subregions and (ii) the specifics of correlation between plasma viral load and T-cell responses within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I HLA supertypes. Virus-specific immune responses in the natural course of HIV-1C infection were analyzed in the gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-enzyme-linked immunospot assay by using synthetic overlapping peptides corresponding to the HIV-1C consensus sequence. For Gag p24, a correlation was seen between better T-cell responses and lower plasma viral load. For Nef, an opposite trend was observed where a higher T-cell response was more likely to be associated with a higher viral load. At the level of the HLA supertypes, a lower viral load was associated with higher T-cell responses to Gag p24 within the HLA A2, A24, B27, and B58 supertypes, in contrast to the absence of such a correlation within the HLA B44 supertype. The present study demonstrated differential correlations (or trends to correlation) in various HIV-1C proteins, suggesting (i) an important role of the HIV-1C Gag p24-specific immune responses in control of viremia and (ii) more rapid viral escape from immune responses to Nef with no restraint of plasma viral load. Correlations between the level of IFN-gamma-secreting T cells and viral load within the MHC class I HLA supertypes should be considered in HIV vaccine design and efficacy trials."

As low bone mineral quality (BMQ) in patients can be considered a marker of possible degeneration in osteopenia and osteoporosis in adulthood, we evaluated bone features in a pediatric population. Forty-four patients (23 females, 21 males; aged 3-17 years) were compared with a control population (1227 healthy children: 568 females, 641 males; aged 3-18 years). Seven patients were CDC stage C, 18 B, and 18 A. All patients were vertically infected; four were naive to any antiretroviral treatment, seven were taking two NRTIs, and 32 were on HAART. BMQ was assessed by a quantitative ultrasound (QUS) technique. It measures the amplitude-dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS, m/sec) and the bone transmission time (BTT, microsec). QUS values were significantly lower in cases than in controls, even after adjustment for age and body size (AD-SoS: 1924.7 +/- 64.9 and BTT: 0.97 +/- 0.3 in controls; AD-SoS: 1879.7 +/- 57.2 and BTT: 0.80 +/- 0.32 in cases; p < or = 0.001). The associations of AD-SoS and BTT with gender, type of therapy, and CDC stages were not significant. AD-SoS and BTT were significantly associated with age (r = 0.59, p < 0.0001), skeletal age SDS (r = 0.46, p = 0.002), height (r = 0.66, p < 0.0001), and therapy duration (r = 0.31, p = 0.04).

GBS occurred during the dry season for 65.7p.cent of the patients. Prior infections were found in 84.4p.cent. The motor deficit was paraplegia or tetraplegia. Clinically, paraplegia was associated with transient urinary sphincteric involvement in 24 HIV-infected patients and 3 HIV negative patients. Facial nerve paralysis was found in 3 patients. Among the 32 patients with GBS, 27 were tested positive for HIV. Two patients were infected by HIV1 and HIV2. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed albumin-cell dissociation and elevated albumin level in 75p.cent of the samples. Autonomic neuropathies were seen in 9 HIV-infected patients. The CD4 counts were above 200/mm3 in 10 among 18 HIV-infected patients. The clinical presentations were more severe in HIV-positive patients with a longer duration of symptoms. HIV-infected patients walked unaided within 51.1 days of peak paralysis. No fatal event occurred. This study indicates clearly that GBS in young adults is strongly associated with HIV infection and should be considered as an indicator of HIV infection in Black Africans.

Analyses were restricted to 341 patients who completed the first 28 days of therapy without dose modification. HCV RNA levels decreased in virtually all patients, but the amount of the change varied markedly. The overall 28-day decrease in HCV RNA levels was at least as predictive of a sustained virological response as the first- or second-phase viral kinetics responses. Factors associated with a smaller decrease in the HCV RNA level between baseline and day 28 included African American race, higher initial HCV RNA level, more severe hepatic fibrosis, and higher body weight. African American patients with similar 28-day decreases in viral levels as white patients were still less likely to achieve a sustained virological response. These results suggest that racial differences in the response to antiviral therapy are due to greater unresponsiveness to intracellular actions of interferon in African American individuals and that standard doses of peginterferon and ribavirin may be suboptimal for patients with higher body weights.

8037,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been the subject of intense research and clinical investigations due to its worldwide prevalence and major role in chronic liver disease. Like most RNA viruses, HCV circulates in vivo as a complex population of different but closely related viral variants, commonly referred to as a quasispecies. Recent studies suggest that ribavirin might exert an antiviral effect against HCV through both mutagenic effect and an impairment of RNA replication. The introduction of alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) plus ribavirin combination therapy was an important breakthrough in the treatment of chronic HCV infection. However, the rate of sustained virological response is still unsatisfactory, particularly in patients infected with HCV genotype 1. Viral persistence, a hallmark of HCV, may result from a dynamic control of the host response by the virus. In children with chronic HCV infection, the viral population is initially highly homogeneous, but diversifies during prolonged infection which seems to be a common event during chronic hepatitis C in childhood. Coinfection of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) patients by HCV can complicate the treatment of these patients with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HIV coinfection is associated with a decrease of HCV quasispecies variability, which appears to be reversed by effective HAART."

Activation indices are higher during coinfection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV. The effect of immune activation on interferon α (IFN-α) therapy response is unknown. We evaluated soluble CD14 (sCD14) and natural killer (NK)-cell subsets at baseline, and during pegIFN-α2a/ribavirin therapy in HCV-HIV coinfection. The sCD14 level increased during therapy. Baseline sCD14 positively correlated with baseline HCV level and CD16(+)56(-) NK-cell frequency, and both sCD14 and CD16(+)56(-) NK cells correlated negatively with magnitude of HCV decline. IL28B genotype was associated with therapy response but not sCD14 or CD16(+)56(-) NK frequency. Markers of innate immune activation predict poor host response to IFN-α-based HCV therapy during HCV-HIV coinfection."

The interaction of HCV with the highly liver-enriched miRNA, miR-122 represents one such unique example of viruses having evolved mechanism(s) to usurp the host miRNA machinery to support viral life cycle. Furthermore, HCV infection can also trigger changes in the cellular miRNA profile, which may ultimately contribute to the outcome of viral infection. Accumulating knowledge on HCV-host miRNA interactions has ultimately influenced the design of therapeutic interventions against chronic HCV infection. The importance of microRNA modulation in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) replication has been reported, albeit only in the context of HIV-1 mono-infection. The development of HCV infection is dramatically influenced during co-infection with HIV-1. Here, we review the current knowledge on miRNAs in HCV mono-infection. In addition, we discuss the potential role of some miRNAs, identified from the analyses of public data, in HCV/HIV-1 co-infection."
2609,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The natural history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has a highly variable course. Many patients develop chronic infection, with its consequent risk of cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. A key question is whether patients at high risk of disease progression can be distinguished from those with relatively benign disease course. The disease progression is influenced by other factors such as duration of infection, age at infection, sex, co-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), Epstein Bar virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), the level of HCV viraemia and its type. Other endemic infections in the community as bilharziasis may have a role in progression of the condition to serious complications. These factors are correlated with newly proposed grades and stages of the disease. The studied (109) cases were divided into 6 groups according to the concomitant infection with HCV. The result proved that groups 1, 3 & 5 had a higher level of viraemia than other groups, and to be the high-risk groups as 56.4% and 34.6% were in G2S2 and G3S3, respectively. All cases of liver cell dysplasia and hepatocellular carcinoma in this study were seen in these groups. The conclusion showed that these factors play an important role in the progression of HCV infection. Death of the patients of this progressive condition occurs in younger age and is more due to liver failure than to HCC."
8217,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third-leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Although hepatitis B still remains the most common risk factor worldwide, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the driving force for the increased incidence of HCC especially in Western countries and Japan. In hepatitis B virus (HBV)-endemic areas, after successful vaccination programs against HBV, chronic HCV infection is now emerging as an important cause of chronic liver diseases. Unlike patients with chronic hepatitis B, those with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) develop HCC in the presence of established cirrhosis in most cases. However, a significant minority of CHC develops HCC in the absence of cirrhosis. Although HCV is a RNA virus with little potential for integrating its genetic material into host genome, various HCV proteins, including core, envelope, and nonstructural proteins, have oncogenic properties by inducing oxidative stress, disturbing cellular regulatory pathways associated with proliferation and apoptosis, and suppressing host immune responses. Overall, a combination of virus-specific, host genetic, environmental, and immune-related factors are likely to determine progression to HCC. Strategies aimed at eliminating the virus may provide opportunities for effective prevention of the development of HCC. Pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy appears to be effective at reducing the risk of HCC in patients who achieve sustained virologic responses. In summary, with the emerging importance of CHC, mechanisms of HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinogenesis should be clarified to provide insight into advanced therapeutic and preventive approaches, which eventually decrease the incidence and mortality of HCC."

Data on sociodemographic variables, clinical and psychological symptoms, treatment compliance, physician/patient relationship, and psychosocial characteristics were obtained by means of semistructured interviews. Every subject also compiled two self-report questionnaires: Coping Orientations to Problem Experiences (COPE) and Medical Outcomes Study-HIV (MOS-HIV) in order to evaluate the use of coping strategies and quality of life. We found a high rate of adherence to HIV therapies (almost 90% of patients had taken at least 80% of medication in the previous 7 days). No significant differences were found between adherence and nonadherence groups as measured by self-report. Few significant differences were found when data laboratory were used. When a Bonferroni corrected p level of <0.001 was used, only a comparison on Mental Disengagement subscale of COPE was statistically significant."

In-depth interviews were conducted with 28 HIV-positive patients. Results showed that most patients were extremely satisfied with their current primary care physicians. When patients were dissatisfied with their care, it was often because there was a mismatch between the patient's expectations of care and the physician's consultation style. Results also showed that good quality physician-patient relationships tended to promote adherence while lesser quality relationships impeded it. Findings suggest that strengthening and promoting the bonds between physicians and HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients should be an absolute priority, at both the interpersonal level of physician-patient interactions but also at the organizational level."

However, drugs don't work in patients who don't take them and in the management of HIV infection it is now well established that optimum adherence to HAART is critical to successful outcome of patients receiving therapy. At least 95% adherence to HAART is optimum and studies have shown that 50%. Important factors that influence adherence to HAART such as regimen related complexities, patient/family related issues and factors related to healthcare delivery system makes adherence to HAART challenging. Although numerous interventions to improve adherence have been investigated in developed as well as developing countries, majority of work in this area is focused on adherence in adults and data in children is limited. Therefore, in order to facilitate adherence and improve outcome of HAART in pediatric population, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of the factors influencing adherence and interventions that can improve adherence in children."

Data from 946 African American and 535 Caucasian patients receiving HIV care at the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research HIV clinic between January 1, 1999, and August 1, 2012, were used to estimate the association between African American race and HIV virological suppression (i.e., undetectable HIV-1 RNA) when racial disparities in clinic attendance were lessened. Clinic attendance was measured as the proportion of scheduled clinic appointments attended (i.e., visit adherence) or the proportion of six 4-month intervals with at least 1 attended scheduled clinic appointment (i.e., visit constancy). In analyses accounting for patient characteristics, the risk ratio for achieving suppression when comparing African Americans with Caucasians was 0.91 (95% confidence interval: 0.85, 0.98). Lessening disparities in adherence or constancy lowered disparities in virological suppression by up to 44.4% and 11.1%, respectively. Interventions that lessen disparities in adherence may be more effective in eliminating disparities in suppression than interventions that lessen disparities in constancy. Given that gaps in care were limited to be no more than 2 years for both attendance measures, the impact of lessening disparities in adherence may be overstated."

Given the current model of HIV neuropathogenesis, which involves monocyte trafficking into the central nervous system, immune factors linked with macrophage maturation and survival may be associated with cognitive decline (measured by neuropsychological z-score [NPZ-8] or Memorial Sloan-Kettering [MSK] score) and alterations in a marker of neuronal integrity, N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Fifty-four chronically infected HIV+ subjects underwent neuropsychological assessment, magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, and quantification of M-CSF in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at baseline. Thirty-nine of those subjects underwent further examination at 3 and 10 months after initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens. Within 3 months of therapy use, CSF M-CSF and viral RNA levels were reduced, whereas NAA concentrations in many brain regions were increased. Neither baseline levels nor the change in M-CSF levels had the ability to predict changes in NAA levels observed after 10 months of combination ART use. At study entry those with the lowest M-CSF levels in the CSF had the least cognitive impairment (NPZ-8). Those who had higher baseline CSF M-CSF levels and exhibited larger decreases in M-CSF after therapy, tended to have greater cognitive improvement after 10 months. Increased prevalence of M-CSF in the setting of HIV infection could contribute to neuronal injury and may be predictive of cognitive impairment."

In individual subjects, the sequences in CSF samples differed significantly from those in plasma. In contrast, the viral sequences in CSF at the baseline did not differ from the sequences in CSF during treatment. Similarly, viral sequences in plasma did not vary over this interval.

Previous studies have shown correlations between increased CSF QUIN levels and the presence of the AIDS dementia complex (ADC), a neurodegenerative condition complicating late-stage human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection in some patients. CSF QUIN is putatively one of the important molecular mediators of the brain injury in this clinical setting and, more generally, serves as a marker of local macrophage activation. This study was undertaken to examine the relationship of CSF QUIN concentrations to local HIV infection and to define the effects of antiretroviral drug treatment on CSF QUIN using two complementary approaches. The first was an exploratory cross-sectional analysis of a clinically heterogeneous sample of 62 HIV-infected subjects, examining correlations of CSF QUIN levels with CSF and plasma HIV RNA levels and other salient parameters of infection. The second involved longitudinal observations of a subset of 20 of these subjects who initiated new antiretroviral therapy regimens. In addition to descriptive analysis, we used kinetic modelling of QUIN decay in relation to that of HIV RNA to assess further the relationship between CSF QUIN and infection in the dynamic setting of treatment. The cross-sectional studies showed strong correlations of CSF QUIN with both CSF HIV RNA and blood QUIN levels, as well as with elevations in CSF white blood cells, CSF total protein and CSF:blood albumin ratio. In this group of subjects with a low incidence of active, untreated ADC, CSF QUIN did not correlate with ADC stage or measures of quantitative neurological performance. Antiviral treatment reduced the CSF QUIN levels in all the longitudinally followed, treated subjects. Kinetic modelling of CSF QUIN decay indicated that CSF QUIN levels were driven primarily by CSF HIV infection with a lesser contribution from blood QUIN levels. In three subjects with new-onset, untreated ADC, CSF QUIN decay paralleled both CSF HIV decrement and improvement in neurological performance. These studies show that CSF QUIN concentrations relate primarily to active CSF HIV infection and to a lesser extent to plasma QUIN. CSF QUIN serves as a marker of local infection with a wide dynamic range. The time course of therapy-induced changes links CSF QUIN to local infection and supports the action of antiviral therapy in ameliorating immunopathological brain injury and ADC."

Recently, genome-wide association studies have identified human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DP polymorphisms (rs3077 and rs9277535) as a new chronic HBV infection susceptibility locus. Since then, the relationship between HLA-DP polymorphisms and various outcomes of HBV infection has been reported. However, the results have been inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship between HLA-DP polymorphisms and various outcomes of HBV infection, a meta-analysis of 62,050 subjects from 29 case-control studies was performed. We found that rs3077 and rs9277535 in HLA-DP significantly decreased HBV infection risks and increased HBV clearance possibility in a dose-dependent manner. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, study design and sample size, significant associations were found for these polymorphisms in almost all comparisons. Meanwhile, haplotype analyses of the two polymorphisms revealed a significant association between the combination of these alleles and HBV infection outcomes. However, no significant results were observed in HCC development. Our results further confirm that genetic variants in the HLA-DP locus are strongly associated with reduced HBV infection and increased the likelihood of spontaneous viral clearance. "

Addition of 0.01-10 ng of IL-4 or IL-13 per milliliters significantly blocked HIV-1 replication in infected cells, judging from levels of reverse transcriptase and p24 antigen in the supernatants of infected cells. Both IL-4 and IL-13 were almost as efficient as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in preventing HIV-1 replication, when given in equivalent amounts. Moreover, neither IL-13 nor IL-4 interfered with the IFN-gamma-mediated enhancement of anti-HIV-1 activity in alveolar macrophages. Both IL-4 and IL-13 interfered with enhanced replication of HIV-1 in macrophages pulsed with the growth factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Interleukin 13 also prevented HIV-1 release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a cocultivation experiment with feeder cells from a seronegative subject. These data suggest that Th2-derived lymphokines have significant anti-HIV-1 activity in cells of the macrophage lineage, although they may enhance the susceptibility of HIV-1-infected subjects to some opportunistic pathogens."
10908,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The reviews on HIV-1/AIDS [1-8] highlighted the mechanism by which HIV-1 virions utilize dendritic cells (DCs) for transport from the genitals, the portal of virus infection, to the draining lymph nodes where DCs carry HIV-1 virions and present viral antigens by HLA class I and II to CD4(+) T cells. Interaction of the T cells with viral antigens presented by HLA class II molecules polarizes them to become Th2 cells, the targets of HIV-1 infection and producers of HIV-1 progeny virions. The T cells which interact with viral antigen presented by HLA class I polarize to become Th1 cells, which stimulate the CD8(+) T cell precursors to develop into antiviral cytotoxic T cells. In addition, HIV-1 virions shed gp120 glycoprotein molecules which bind to IgE immunoglobulin molecules bound to FCepsilonRI+ innate system cells (basophils, mast cells and monocytes) and induce them to release large amounts of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13), thereby creating an allergy-like condition. The present review attempts to define the role of chemokine receptors like CCR5 and CXCR4, and especially fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 in the trafficking of lymphocytes in healthy individuals and HIV-1/AIDS patients. The role of chemokine receptors as co-receptors for HIV-1 virion gp120 glycoprotein has been defined, but the role of fractalkine and fractalkine receptor has been clarified only recently [9-19]. In healthy individuals fractalkine is expressed by blood vessel endothelial cells and the CX3CR1 receptors are expressed on leukocytes that migrate in the peripheral blood in the direction of increased fractalkine concentration. In HIV-1/AIDS patients the virus-infected CD4(+) Th2 cells migrate to organs that harbor the adaptive immune system cells in the thymus, genitals, gastrointestinal tract, and to the brain. A most significant finding which revealed the importance of the human CX3CR1 gene expression to the progression of the infection to the stage of AIDS was recently reported by Faure and collaborators [20, 21] who showed that the delayed or rapid progression to AIDS was affected in HIV-1-infected individuals who had inherited a fractalkine receptor gene with the polymorphisms V249I or T280M, respectively, located in the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains of CX3CR1 protein. The T280M mutation in the CX3CR1 gene caused a rapid progression to AIDS, while in patients with the V249I mutation progression to AIDS was much slower. These studies led to the idea that it might be possible to slow or prevent HIV-1/AIDS progression in HIV-1 patients by treating them with fractalkine antagonists that will bind to and inhibit the activity of the fractalkine receptor. It is hypothesized that treatment of HIV-1/AIDS patients with a combination of fractalkine antagonists, IL-4 antagonist IL-4delta2 and the adjuvant CpG ODN induced release of type I IFN from PDF, and may inhibit HIV-1 infection, especially in HAART-treated patients infected with drug-resistant HIV-1 mutants due to prevention of the availability of immune cells needed for the viral evasion of the immune response. The hypothesis implies that the advantage of the suggested mode of treatment of HIV-1-infected people is prevention of cellular processes that are used by the viral protein to cause immunodeficiency, and prevention of HIV-1 replication without induction of resistant mutants."

Sinusitis episodes were commonly associated with nonspecific, chronic symptoms (67.4%, persistent nasal discharge; 54.7%, nocturnal or persistent cough), whereas symptoms more specific to acute sinusitis were less frequent (17.9%, headache or facial pain; 9.5%, periorbital swelling; 25.3%, temperature of > or = 102 degrees F; 9%, total white blood cell count of > or = 15,000/mm3).

Social and structural factors such as HIV-related stigma, gender discrimination, and racial discrimination converge to increase vulnerability to HIV infection among ACB women by reducing access to HIV prevention services. Stigma and discrimination also present barriers to treatment, care, and support and may contribute to mental health problems. We administered a cross-sectional survey to HIV-positive ACB women (n=173) across Ontario in order to examine the relationships between HIV-related stigma, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, and depression. One-third of participants reported moderate/severe depression scores using the Beck Depression Inventory Fast-Screen guidelines. Hierarchical block regression, moderation, and mediation analyses were conducted to measure associations between independent (HIV-related stigma, gender discrimination, racial discrimination), moderator/mediator (social support, resilient coping), and dependent (depression) variables. Findings included: (1) HIV-related stigma was associated with increased depression; (2) resilient coping was associated with reduced depression but did not moderate the influence of HIV-related stigma on depression; and (3) the effects of HIV-related stigma on depression were partially mediated through resilient coping. HIV-related stigma, gender discrimination, and racial discrimination were significantly correlated with one another and with depression, highlighting the salience of examining multiple intersecting forms of stigma. Generalizability of findings may be limited due to nonrandom sampling. Findings emphasize the importance of multi-component interventions, including building resilient coping skills, mental health promotion and assessment, and stigma reduction programs."

Laboratory tests, including complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests, helper/inducer T lymphocyte numbers (CD4), serum dibucaine numbers, and serum pseudocholinesterase concentrations were examined. Control and study subjects both exhibited normal dibucaine numbers, but the pseudocholinesterase concentrations were significantly lower in the group that was not receiving AZT relative to the AZT treatment group. However, only two patients, neither of whom were receiving AZT, demonstrated low or borderline low pseudocholinesterase concentrations according to laboratory criteria. It is possible that pseudocholinesterase synthesis is significantly inhibited by the HIV disease process and that treatment with AZT partly reverses the inhibition. Associated variables contributing to low pseudocholinesterase concentrations in the HIV-positive patient are explored."

OCI has been detected among different patients groups worldwide, it has been found not only in chronic hepatitis patients of unknown origin, but also among several groups at risk for HCV infection (hemodialysis patients or family members of patients with occult HCV). This occult infection has been reported also in healthy populations without evidence of liver disease. Prevalence of occult Hepatitis C virus has not been investigated in Georgian population, where a rate of HCV infection is highest (6.7%) among Eastern European Countries. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of occult HCV infection among HIV infected individuals in Georgia. As a pilot study, we have selected three groups of HIV infected patients for analyses: Group 1- HIV infected patients without evidence of liver disease (n=98), group 2- HIV infected patients with cryptogenic liver disease (n=34) and group 3- HIV/HBV co infected patients (n=29). HCV RNA was tested in PBMCs samples by real-time polymerase chain reaction. HCV genotyping was performed by Line-probe assay based on reverse-hybridization technology. Liver fibrosis was evaluated by transient elastography (FibroScan®). HCV-RNA was detected in PBMCs specimens among 2 (2%) subjects from group 1, 4 (12%) subjects from group 2, and 9 (31%) subjects from group 3. HCV genotypes were determined for 14 of 15 OCI subjects resulting following genotype distribution: 6 (46%) - 1b, 3 (23%) - 2a/2c and 5 (38%) - 3a. One samples failed to be genotyped due to extremely low HCV viral load. Our data revealed the occurrence of occult HCV infection in HIV infected patients. No single HCV genotype was predominant in the present study. Liver fibrosis was found more frequently and the fibrosis score was significantly higher in OCI patients versus negative ones, suggesting that undiagnosed OCI might impact on the liver damage. The study demonstrated that testing only for HCV antibody fails to identify the true prevalence of HCV co-infection among HIV infected patients. We propose that in the absence of liver biopsy specimens, analysis of PBMC sample for HCV-RNA would be informative for detection of occult HCV. "

It was shown previously that greater pretransplantation HCV titers are associated with relatively poor patient and graft survival. The tolerability and efficacy of antiviral therapy in patients with decompensated liver disease are not known. We conducted a pilot study to determine the likely tolerability and efficacy of pretransplantation antiviral therapy with interferon alfa-2b, with or without ribavirin. HCV RNA-positive patients at or near the top of their respective waiting lists were randomly assigned to one of three treatment regimens until the time of liver transplantation: (1) group A, interferon alfa-2b, 1 x 10(6) U/d; (2) group B, interferon alfa-2b, 3 x 10(6) U three times weekly; or (3) group C, interferon alfa-2b, 1 x 10(6) U/d, plus ribavirin, 400 mg twice daily. Less than half the patients screened met entry criteria, with thrombocytopenia and leukopenia the most common reasons for exclusion. Fifteen patients were administered antiviral therapy; three patients in group A and six patients each in groups B and C. Loss of detectable HCV RNA was seen in 33% of patients, whereas 55% had a decrease in viral titers on therapy. Twenty-three adverse events occurred, including 20 serious adverse events. Thrombocytopenia was the most common adverse event. Two infectious complications occurred; one of these had a fatal outcome. We conclude that although pretransplantation antiviral therapy may reduce HCV titers in a minority of patients who meet treatment initiation criteria, adverse events associated with therapy are frequent and often severe in patients with Child's class B and C cirrhosis."

Until recently, the clinical impact of chronic hepatitis C was largely overshadowed by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in this risk group. With recent advances in treating HIV infection, there is greater emphasis on the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic hepatitis C in the hemophilic population. A recent study from the United Kingdom demonstrated that mortality from chronic liver disease in hemophilic patients was 16.7 times greater than in the general population, and death resulting from liver cancer, 5.6 times greater. Before the advent of protease inhibitors, which can alter the natural history of HIV infection, co-infection with HIV appeared to accelerate the course of chronic hepatitis C. Levels of HCV RNA were dramatically increased after HIV seroconversion, and liver failure was found in 9% of patients, exclusively among those co-infected with HIV. HCV genotypes generally reflect the predominant genotype of the donor population, but multiple genotypes may be present. Liver biopsy may be performed safely via the percutaneous or transjugular route in hemophilic patients with chronic hepatitis C, although there is an increased cost because of the expense of factor replacement. Response to interferon in this population has been similar to that expected in the general population. Large trials are underway to evaluate the role of combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin for the treatment of patients with hemophilia and hepatitis C."

The Egyptian group included 110 patients of whom 55 were HCV positive and the other 55 HCV negative (control group). The Saudi group included 146 HCV positive patients and 122 HCV negative individuals (control group). The results for the Egyptian population revealed increased frequencies of some HLA phenotypes and decreased frequencies of others but without any statistically significant difference. In contrast, in the Saudi population, the HLA-A19 phenotype was significantly increased in HCV positive patients when compared with the control group while significantly decreased frequencies were found for HLA-B8, HLA-DRI and HLA DR3. Our data suggest that there was no significant association between HLA phenotypes and susceptibility to HCV infection among the Egyptian population while the overall data of the Saudi population seem to indicate that the expression of particular HLA alleles could be associated with susceptibility or resistance to the HCV infection. Further studies on larger numbers of patients are needed to support the role of the HLA system in HCV infection. A total of 108 HCV positive patients underwent renal transplantation at the Jeddah Kidney Center and the results were compared with 100 age and sex-matched controls. Graft survival at 36 months was 82% and 86% for HCV positive and control subjects respectively while patient survival was respectively 90% and 91%. Our data suggest that the outcome, at least in the Short-time, of renal transplantation in HCV positive patients is very good."
15783,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Limited information is available on the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the general population in China. A community-based epidemiological study was conducted in three counties in eastern China. A total of 149 175 individuals were investigated in 60 communities in three counties in Jiangsu province, eastern China, of whom 1175 subjects [0·79%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·74-0·83] were HCV antibody positive. The prevalence was low in children (0·09%, 95% CI 0·04-0·17), but increased progressively from adolescents (0·20%, 95% CI 0·15-0·28) to adults aged ⩾21 years (95% CI 0·15-1·64). Women had a higher prevalence of HCV infection than men in most age groups. In a multilevel regression analysis, age, sex, education, occupation, blood transfusion [odds ratio (OR) 2·91, 95% CI 1·09-5·37], invasive testing (OR 1·28, 95% CI 1·14-1·61), and dental therapy (OR 2·27, 95% CI 1·41-3·42) were associated with HCV infection. In conclusion, although the prevalence of HCV in this population was lower than reported from national levels, the total reservoir of infection is significant and warrants public health measures, such as health education to limit the magnitude of the problem.

We evaluated the prevalence and risk factors for HCV among military conscripts, including a sample of 5,246 men (1:30 sample), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 positive men (N = 500) between 2005 and 2008. The HCV prevalence was 2.2% in the sampled group and 8.4% in HIV-1 sero-positives. Among the sampled group, HIV-1 infection, injection drug use (IDU) history, and unsafe injections were associated with HCV infection; adjusted prevalence rate ratios [RRs; 95% confidence intervals (CIs)] were 3.7 (1.04-12.77), 1.9 (1.04-3.54), and 1.8 (1.02-3.11), respectively. Among HIV-1 sero-positives, an IDU history and residence in southern Thailand were associated with HCV prevalence; adjusted RRs (95% CIs) were 3.5 (1.71-7.24) and 2.6 (1.18-5.61), respectively. Public health measures to prevent HCV in Thailand should focus on reducing injection drug use and other exposures to unsafe injections among young Thai men."

In this study, 113 chronic hepatitis B patients in the immune active HBeAg-positive phase were followed up for 76 weeks. Based on the outcome of liver function, HBeAg, hepatitis B viral e antibody (anti-HBe) and HBV DNA at week 76, 18 patients were classified as spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion group (group A) and 95 patients were classified as non-spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion group (group B). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only week 28 HBV DNA levels were used for the logistic regression equation, and the odds ratio was 0.505 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.366-0.697). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for HBV DNA and HBeAg levels at week 28 were 0.824 (P < 0.001, 95% CI: 0.720-0.927) and 0.832 (P < 0.001, 95% CI: 0.744-0.921), respectively. Based on the maximization of Youden's index, the optimal cutoff values of HBV DNA and HBeAg levels at week 28 were 3.84 log10 IU/ml and 1.53 log10 PEI-U/ml, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of HBV DNA levels at week 28 were 50.0%, 97.9%, 81.8%, and 91.2%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of HBeAg levels at week 28 were 94.4%, 60.0%, 30.9%, and 98.3%, respectively. In conclusion, the dynamic monitoring of HBV DNA and HBeAg levels predicted accurately determines spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion over the duration of 1 year."
15541,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The prevalence of hepatitis B infection in population in Poland is low and averages 1-1.5%. However, it means that about 380,000 Poles constantly or temporarily replicate HBV. Chronic HBV infection is associated with increased risk of serious liver diseases and it is estimated that 25-40% of patients with chronic hepatitis B will die prematurely of cirrhosis or primary liver cancer. Up to the present, interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), with low response rate between 25-55% and some limitations of therapy, has been the only available treatment for chronic hepatitis B. A favorable outcome of IFN-alpha therapy is associated with some prognostic factors, not accepted by all investigators, such as low level of HBV-DNA in serum. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of therapy with IFN-alpha 2b (Intron A), administered s.c. 5 MU x 3/week for 16 weeks, in 65 patients with chronic hepatitis B, divided into groups according to the baseline HBV-DNA level. Except for serum HBV-DNA level, there were no demographical and biochemical differences between all the treated groups. The patients were followed-up for 12 months. Sustained response (SR) to the therapy (defined as ALAT normalization, loss of detectable HBV-DNA, seroconversion HBeAg to anti-HBeAg and improvement in liver histology) was observed in 16 (57.14%) of patients in the group with HBVDNA level < 1000 pg/ml, in 6 (37.5%) with HBV-DNA level of 1001-3000 pg/ml, in 4 (28.57%) with HBV-DNA level of 3001-5000 pg/ml and only in 2 (28.57%) of patients in group with HBVDNA level > 5000 pg/ml. We conclude that IFN-alpha is particularly useful in therapy of patients with chronic hepatitis B with low levels of HBV-DNA. The baseline HBVDNA level < 1000 pg/ml in serum is the predictor of good response to IFN-alpha therapy."

The study objective was to examine correlates of HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Jamaica. We conducted a cross-sectional tablet-based survey with MSM in Jamaica using chain referral sampling. We assessed socio-demographic, individual, social, and structural factors associated with HIV infection. A logit-link model, fit using backwards-stepwise regression, was used to estimate a final multivariable model. Among 498 participants (median age: 24, interquartile range: 22-28), 67 (13.5%) were HIV-positive. In the multivariable model, HIV infection was associated with increased odds of socio-demographic (older age, odds ratio [OR]: 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.10]; residing in Kingston versus Ocho Rios [OR: 6.99, 95% CI 2.54-19.26]), individual (poor/fair versus excellent/good self-rated health [OR: 4.55, 95% CI: 1.81-11.42], sexually transmitted infection [STI] history [OR: 3.67, 95% CI: 1.61-8.38]), and structural (enacted sexual stigma [OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01-1.15], having a health care provider [OR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.06-4.66]) factors. This is among the first studies to demonstrate associations between sexual stigma and HIV infection in Jamaica. Findings underscore the need to integrate STI testing in the HIV care continuum and to address stigma and regional differences among MSM in Jamaica."

Information was collected from the medical records of the infected men and by direct interviews with the women. In a logistic regression analysis, the woman's awareness of her partner's seropositivity (odds ratio [OR], 0.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0 to 1.1), use of condoms (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 1), and oral contraceptive use (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.0) were negatively associated with transmission of the HIV infection. An increased risk was found in women having sexual intercourse more than twice a week (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 4.9) and in women who had been sexually exposed to HIV for between 2 and 5 years (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.8 to 6.7). The transmission rate was higher in couples who engaged in anal sex (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3 to 6.3); in women reporting vaginitis (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.4 to 10.2) or genital warts (OR, 33.3; 95% CI, 4.5 to 244.1); and in those using intrauterine devices (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to 7.1). The risk for women was also associated with a CD4+ cell count lower than 400/mm3 in their partners.

The goal of the analysis presented was to examine the relationship of CD4+ T cell counts and HIV-1 plasma viral loads in adolescents. The CD4+ T cell counts of 84 HIV+ subjects who were 13 to 19 years of age were measured at the clinical sites, using ACTG standardized techniques. HIV-1 viral loads in frozen plasma were determined by the NASBA/NucliSens assay at a central laboratory. Past and current treatment with antiretroviral drugs was determined by medical record abstraction and interview data. The slope of the line generated by regressing log10 HIV-1 RNA (copies/ml) versus CD4+ T cell counts of REACH subjects who are antiretroviral drug naive was negative and significantly different than zero. A negative association has also been reported for antiretroviral drug-naive, adult males in the Pittsburgh Men's Study, a component of MACS (Pitt-MACS) (Mellors J, et al.: Science 1996;272:1167). These data show that in adolescents, as in adults, HIV-1 RNA concentrations are correlated with corresponding absolute CD4+ T cell count. The slopes of the lines generated with data from each cohort were different (p = 0.003). In addition to age, there are sex and racial differences in the makeup of the two cohorts. Any or all of these differences may affect the slopes of the lines."

This study included 83,041 HIV-infected adults from 14 clinical cohorts in the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD) who had ≥1 HIV primary care encounters during 2000-2010, contributing 468,816 person-years of follow-up. Encounter-based retention (REB) was defined as ≥2 encounters in a calendar year, ≥90 days apart. Laboratory-based retention (RLB) was defined similarly, using the dates of CD4-positive cell counts or HIV-1 RNA measurements. Percentage of agreement and the κ statistic were used to characterize agreement between RLB and REB. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations and stabilized inverse-probability-of-selection weights was used to elucidate temporal trends and the discriminatory power of RLB as a predictor of REB, accounting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, primary HIV risk factor, and cohort site as potential confounders. Both REB and RLB increased from 2000 to 2010 (from 67% to 78% and from 65% to 77%, respectively), though REB was higher than RLB throughout (P < 0.01). RLB agreed well with REB (80%-86% agreement; κ = 0.55-0.62, P < 0.01) and had a strong, imperfect ability to discriminate between persons retained and not retained in care by REB (C statistic: C = 0.81, P < 0.05).

We systematically searched four electronic databases for all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative cohort studies in LMICs comparing community versus health facility-based interventions. Relative risks (RRs) for pre-defined adherence, treatment engagement (linkage and retention in care), and relevant clinical outcomes were pooled using random effect models. Eleven cohort studies and eleven RCTs (N = 97,657) were included. Meta-analysis of the included RCTs comparing community- versus health facility-based interventions found comparable outcomes in terms of ART adherence (RR = 1.02, 95 % CI 0.99 to 1.04), virologic suppression (RR = 1.00, 95 % CI 0.98 to 1.03), and all-cause mortality (RR = 0.93, 95 % CI 0.73 to 1.18). The result of pooled analysis from the RCTs (RR = 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.06) and cohort studies (RR = 1.09, 95 % CI 1.03 to 1.15) found that participants assigned to community-based interventions had statistically significantly higher rates of treatment engagement. Two studies found community-based ART delivery model either cost-saving or cost-effective. Community- versus facility-based models of ART delivery resulted in at least comparable outcomes for clinically stable HIV-infected patients on treatment in LMICs and are likely to be cost-effective."

Discordant responders maintained CD4+ cell levels >200/mm(3) with stable or increasing trend, despite sustained VLs of 500-5000 copies/mL, for >2 years. Treatment-success patients had CD4+ cell counts >200/mm(3) with stable or increasing trend and VLs <50 copies/mL, for >2 years. Treatment-failure patients initially responded to HAART, followed by decreasing CD4+ cell counts and increasing VLs. Interferon-gamma production to gag and noncytolytic CD8+ cell suppressive activity were greater in discordant responders. Cellular activation was greatest in patients with treatment failure. All discordant responders had non-syncytium-inducing (CCR5-tropic) viruses. Viruses from discordant responders and from patients with treatment failure had extensive resistance mutations; discordant responders had significantly lower viral replication capacities. These findings suggest that discordant responses may be related to enhanced HIV-directed immune responses, diminished cellular activation, decreased viral replication capacity, and preservation of non-syncytium-inducing virus strains."

Methods. Serum samples from a cohort of 92 mother-infant pairs and a cross-sectional cohort of 100 children (median age, 4 years) were tested. In the cohort of mother-infant pairs, 14 infants were HIV-infected, 72 were not and the HIV status was unknown for 6. In the cohort of children 70 were HIV-infected and 30 were vertically exposed but uninfected. Serologic responses to two HHV-8 antigens, latency-associated nuclear antigen and the structural antigen encoded by open reading frame 65 were detected by immunofluorescent antibody test and enzyme-linked immunoassay. Results were confirmed by Western blot. Results. All HHV-8-seropositive mothers were African (17 of 92, 18.5%). Six of their infants were HHV-8-seronegative and 11 had at least 1 HHV-8-seropositive sample. One of the 11 infants tested only at birth had a lower antibody titer than the mother; the remaining 10 infants had decreasing titers up to 7 months of age and 6 became seronegative. No infants born to HHV-8-seronegative mothers had antibodies to the virus. The seroprevalence to HHV-8 was 6% in the cohort of children. All had African mothers and their median age was greater than that of the cohort (8.4 vs. 4.0 years). Five were coinfected with HIV. Conclusions. HHV-8 was not vertically transmitted by any of the HIV-coinfected mothers. Acquisition of antibody to HHV-8 occurred in older children, implying a horizontal route of transmission."

The purposes of this study were to estimate the frequency and intensity of HIV-related signs and symptoms in patients with HIV infection and to explore relationships between HIV-related symptoms and the HAART regimen. Data on a total of 172 HIV-positive patients enrolled in an HIV case management program were analyzed for this study. Participants experienced an average of 9.73+/-7.27 symptoms, with fatigue, dry mouth and weakness the most frequently reported. Average mean symptom intensity among participants was 13.24+/-11.48. Insomnia, depression and disorientation were the most severe symptoms. No differences were recorded between HIV-related symptoms and disease progression. Fatigue intensity showed significant differences between NRTI (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), +NNRTI (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) and NRTI+PI (protease inhibitors) based regimens (p=.03). In addition, cluster symptoms of confusion/distress among participants without HAART had a significantly higher mean intensity than those with HAART (t=2.0, df=1, p=.04).

A total of 1218 Caucasian rheumatologic patients, admitted consecutively as outpatients between 2001 and 2012 and taking biologic therapies, underwent evaluation of anti-HCV and HBV markers as well as liver amino transferases every 3 months. Starting from January 2009, HBV DNA monitoring was performed in patients with a prHBV infection who had started immunosuppressive biologic therapy both before and after 2009. Patients were considered to have elevated aminotransferase levels if values were >1× upper normal limit at least once during follow-up. We found 179 patients with a prHBV infection (14 treated with rituximab, 146 with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and 19 with other biologic therapies) and 959 patients without a prHBV infection or other liver disease (controls). The mean age in the former group was significantly higher than the controls. Patients with a prHBV infection never showed detectable HBV DNA serum levels or antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen/hepatitis B surface antigen seroreversion.

16186,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Tuberculosis (TB) has recently surpassed HIV as the primary infectious disease killer worldwide, but the two diseases continue to display lethal synergy. The burden of TB is disproportionately borne by people living with HIV, particularly where HIV and poverty coexist. The impact of these diseases on one another is bidirectional, with HIV increasing risk of TB infection and disease progression and TB slowing CD4 recovery and increasing progression to AIDS and death among the HIV infected. Both antiretroviral therapy (ART) and latent TB infection (LTBI) treatment mitigate the impact of coinfection, and ART is now recommended for HIV-infected patients independent of CD4 count. LTBI screening should be performed for all HIV-positive people at the time of diagnosis, when their CD4 count rises above 200, and yearly if there is repeated exposure. Tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) may perform better with serial testing than interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs). Any patient with HIV and a TST induration of ≥5 mm should be evaluated for active TB disease and treated for LTBI if active disease is ruled out. Because HIV impairs multiple aspects of immune function, progressive HIV is associated with lower rates of cavitary pulmonary TB and higher rates of disseminated and extrapulmonary disease, so a high index of suspicion is important, and sputum should be obtained for evaluation even if chest radiographs are negative. TB diagnosis is similar in patients with and without TB, relying on smear, culture, and nucleic acid amplification tests, which are the initial tests of choice. TSTs and IGRAs should not be used in the evaluation of active TB disease since these tests are often negative with active disease. Though not always performed in resource-limited settings, drug susceptibility testing should be performed on all TB isolates from HIV-positive patients. Urine lipoarabinomannan testing may also be helpful in HIV-positive patients with disseminated disease. Treatment of TB in HIV-infected patients is similar to that of TB in HIV-negative patients except that daily therapy is required for all coinfected patients, vitamin B6 supplementation should be given to all coinfected patients receiving isoniazid to reduce peripheral neuropathy, and specific attention needs to be paid to drug-drug interactions between rifamycins and many classes of antiretrovirals. In patients requiring ART that contains ritonavir or cobicistat, this can be managed by the use of rifabutin at 150 mg daily in place of rifampin. For newly diagnosed coinfected patients, mortality is lower if treatment is provided in parallel, rather than serially, with treatment initiation within 2 weeks preferred for those with CD4 counts of <50 and within 8 to 12 weeks for those with higher CD4 counts. When TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome occurs, patients can often be treated symptomatically with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but a minority will benefit from steroids. Generally, patients who do not have space-occupying lesions such as occurs in TB meningitis do not require cessation of therapy."

The impact of baseline V3 characteristics on treatment response was evaluated in a randomised, double blind, prospective cohort study with patients initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy with lopinavir or efavirenz plus azithothymidine/3TC (1:1) over 48 weeks. Similar virological and immunological responses were observed for both treatment regimens. The 43 individuals had a mean baseline CD4 T cell count of 119 cells/mm(3) [standard deviation (SD) = 99] and a mean viral load of 5.09 log(10) copies/mL (SD = 0.49). The GWGR motif was not associated with a CD4 T cell response, but predicted R5 tropism by the geno2pheno([clinical20%]) algorithm correlated with higher CD4 T cell levels at all monitoring points (p < 0.05). Moreover, higher false-positive rates (FPR) values from this analysis revealed a strong correlation with CD4 T cell recovery (p < 0.0001). Transmitted drug resistance mutations, documented in 3/41 (7.3%) cases, were unrelated to the assigned antiretroviral regimen and had no impact on patient outcomes. In conclusion, naÏve HIV-1 R5 infected patients exhibited higher CD4 T cell counts at baseline; this difference was sustained throughout therapy.

The appearance of viral RNA is particularly prominent in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), suggesting an efficient route of virus transfer across the blood-CSF barrier. This raises the concern whether this route can establish a stable viral reservoir and also be a source of virus capable of reseeding peripheral systems. To examine this possibility, 200 mul of cell-free NCSU1 FIV or FIV-infected choroid plexus macrophages (ChP-Mac) was directly injected into the right lateral ventricle of the brain. Negative controls were sham inoculated with uninfected ChP-Mac or virus-free culture supernatant and positive controls were infected systemically by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) inoculation with cell-free FIV resulted in high levels of plasma FIV RNA detected as early as 1 to 2 weeks post inoculation in all cats. In each case, the plasma viremia preceded the detection of CSF viral RNA. Compared to i.p. cats, i.c.v. cats had 32-fold higher CSF viral loads, 8-fold higher ratios of CSF to plasma viral load, and a 23-fold greater content of FIV proviral DNA in the brain. No FIV RNA was detected in plasma or CSF from the cats inoculated with FIV-infected ChP-Mac but an acute inflammatory response and a slight suppression of the CD4+:CD8+ ratio were observed. These results indicate that free FIV circulating in the CSF promotes infection of the CNS and provides a highly efficient pathway for the transfer of infectious virus to the periphery."

Antiretroviral-experienced patients with detectable viraemia starting a raltegravir (RAL)-based regimen between March 2007 and June 2009 were consecutively enrolled and followed for ≥4 years. Data were censored at Week 206 for homogeneity. Of 333 patients, 258 (77.5%) were still on RAL-based therapy at Week 206, and 241 had undetectable HIV-1 RNA (73% in intention-to-treat analysis). Of the 75 subjects who discontinued RAL therapy, 36 were lost to follow-up, 15 changed their regimen due to virological failure, 2 simplified their regimen stopping RAL, 9 stopped all antiretrovirals and 13 died. Overall, 100 subjects (30.0%) had at least one detectable viraemia, but only 32 (9.6%) had true viral failure. Seventeen patients continued their failing regimen. 'Blips' were experienced by 53 patients (15.9%), whilst 15 (4.5%) had confirmed viral rebound due to adherence issues and were re-suppressed upon treatment re-introduction. In a multivariate analysis of predictors of interruption or failure, each baseline HIV-1 RNA log10 increase was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio for failure of 1.6; having more than 13 previous treatment courses also emerged as a predictor. Overall, adverse events were rare (n=64), with 13 deaths. Tumours were mainly early events, often fatal (7/15), mainly non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (8), followed by hepatocarcinoma (2). RAL proved effective and well tolerated in this cohort, and few patients experienced viral failure after 4 years. "

An important element of palliative care is symptom management. However, little is known about the range of symptoms and the distress associated with them among rural South Africans living with HIV/AIDS. A cross-sectional study was conducted to describe the spectrum of symptoms experienced by 64 HIV-positive patients who received palliative care from a rural home-based palliative care program. Data were determined using a questionnaire adapted from an HIV symptom list and HIV symptom profile. The physical symptoms of most immediate importance identified by the respondents were localized pain, skin problems, cough, vaginal discharge/infection, and fatigue. The psychological symptoms of the most immediate and overall importance were feelings of anger, loneliness, decreased support from family and friends, and a decreased sense of satisfaction. This study provides insight into the spectrum of HIV-associated symptoms in a rural South African HIV-positive population. Through improved symptom assessment and management, nurses can improve palliative care services to those suffering from the distressful symptoms associated with HIV infection."

We extend the model to focus on the effects of condom use as a single strategy approach in HIV prevention in the absence of any other intervention strategies. Initially, we model the use of male condoms, followed by incorporating the use of both the female and male condoms. The model includes two primary factors in condom use to control HIV which are condom efficacy and compliance. Reproductive numbers for these models are computed and compared to assess the effectiveness of male and female condom use in a community. We also extend the basic model to consider the effects of antiretroviral therapy as a single strategy. The results from the study show that condoms can reduce the number of secondary infectives and thus can slow the development of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Further, we note from the study that treatment of AIDS patients may enlarge the epidemic when the treatment drugs are not 100% effective and when treated AIDS patients indulge in risky sexual behaviour. Thus, the treatment with amelioration of AIDS patients should be accompanied with intense public health educational programs, which are capable of changing the attitude of treated AIDS patients towards safe sex. It is also shown from the study that the use of condoms in settings with the treatment may help in reducing the number of secondary infections thus slowing the epidemic."

Coadministration with low-dose ritonavir significantly improves the pharmacokinetic properties and hence the activity of lopinavir against HIV-1 protease. Coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir was developed for ease of administration and to ensure both drugs are taken together, as part of combination therapy with other antiretroviral agents. Coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimens provide adequate and durable suppression of viral load and sustained improvements in CD4+ cell counts, as demonstrated in randomised trials in antiretroviral therapy-naive and -experienced adults and children. To date, development of primary resistance to lopinavir/ritonavir has not been observed in 470 antiretroviral therapy-naive patients treated for >48 weeks. The lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimen was more effective than nelfinavir in antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV-1-infected patients in a phase III trial. The coformulation is also effective as 'salvage' therapy, as shown by low cross-resistance rates in patients who failed to respond to treatment with other PIs in phase II trials. Coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir was well tolerated in both antiretroviral therapy-naive and -experienced HIV-1-infected adults and children with low rates of study drug-related treatment discontinuations. The most common adverse event in adults associated with lopinavir/ritonavir was diarrhoea, followed by other gastrointestinal disturbances, asthenia, headache and skin rash. The incidence of moderate-to-severe adverse events in children was low, skin rash being the most common. Changes in body fat composition occurred with equal frequency in lopinavir/ritonavir- and nelfinavir-treated naive patients, through week 60 in a phase III study. Although laboratory abnormalities occurred with similar frequency in both treatment groups, triglycerides grade 3/4 elevations were significantly more frequent with lopinavir/ritonavir. Total cholesterol and triglycerides grade 3/4 elevations appear to occur more frequently in PI-experienced than in PI-naive lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients. A number of clinically important drug interactions have been reported with lopinavir/ritonavir necessitating dosage adjustments of lopinavir/ritonavir and/or the interacting drugs, and several other drugs are contraindicated in patients receiving the coformulation."

A multicenter, open-label, single-arm observational study was conducted in a diverse cohort of HIV-infected patients (goals: ≥25% women; ≥50% blacks in the United States), enrolling treatment-experienced patients failing or intolerant to current antiretroviral therapy (ART) and treatment-naive patients (limited to ≤20%). All patients received raltegravir 400 mg b.i.d. in a combination antiretroviral regimen for up to 48 weeks. A total of 206 patients received study treatment at 34 sites in the United States, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and South Africa: 97 (47%) were female and 153 (74%) were black [116 (56%) in the United States]. Of these, 185 patients were treatment experienced: 97 (47%) were failing and 88 (43%) were intolerant to current therapy; 21 patients (10%) were treatment naive. Among treatment-intolerant patients, 55 (63%) had HIV-1 RNA<50 copies/ml at baseline. Overall, 15% of patients discontinued: 13% of men, 18% of women, 14% of blacks, and 17% of nonblacks. At week 48, HIV RNA was <50 copies/ml in 60/94 (64%) patients failing prior therapy, 61/80 (76%) patients intolerant to prior therapy, and 16/21 (76%) treatment-naive patients. Response rates were similar for men vs. women and black vs. nonblack patients. Drug-related clinical adverse events were reported by 8% of men, 18% of women, 14% of blacks, and 9% of nonblacks.

The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels and response to IFN therapy. HBV DNA levels in residual stored sera from patients who participated in the above trial were quantified by a branched DNA (bDNA) assay. Nominal logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of response to IFN treatment as a function of pretreatment ALT and/or HBV DNA levels. We found a significant (P < 0.01) correlation between the HBV DNA levels at midtreatment and response to IFN therapy. Response was achieved in 53% of patients who had undetectable HBV DNA levels at midtreatment but in only 17% of those who remained HBV DNA positive (P < 0.01). In contrast, the probabilities of response for patients with baseline HBV DNA levels over the range 10 to 10000 million equivalents (MEq) ml-1 were almost identical. We also found a significant correlation between the pretreatment ALT levels and response to IFN therapy. The probabilities of response for patients with pretreatment ALT levels of 500 and 100 IU l-1 were higher than for patients with normal ALT levels by two and onefold, respectively. Our findings may help to improve the cost-effectiveness of IFN therapy for chronic hepatitis B by guiding the selection of patients for therapy and in optimizing the duration of treatment for the individual patient."

Fifty-six HIV+ patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) (group I = 24 controls; II = 23 HIV/HCV-coinfected; III = 9 cirrhotic HIV/HCV-coinfected) were included. Total (n = 56) and unbound (n = 36) LPV pharmacokinetic parameters were determined at steady-state using validated high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters (plasma concentration just before drug administration, peak concentrations in plasma, times to maximum plasma concentration, areas under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 hours, and CL/F/kg) of both total and unbound LPV were calculated by standard noncompartmental methods and differences among groups evaluated (Kruskal-Wallis test).LPV apparent oral clearance normalized to body weight (median, interquartile range) was 55 (40-68), 59 (44-69), and 71 (53-78) mL/h/kg for groups I, II, and III, respectively (II vs. I, P = 0.52; III vs. I, P = 0.16). The areas under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 hours were 110.4 (80.9-135.2), 103.4 (85.5-131.3), and 92.8 (87.4-116.3) microg h/mL for groups I, II, and III, respectively (II vs. I, P = 0.68; III vs. I, P = 0.71).

The apparent oral clearance of unbound LPV (CLu/F/kg) in cirrhotic patients did not change significantly, supporting the concept that the clearance of unbound LPV in liver disease is not affected after being inhibited by low-dose ritonavir co-administration.LPV total and unbound pharmacokinetics were not affected by hepatic impairment, suggesting that no adjustment of LPV/r dose is required for HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with and without cirrhosis and moderate impairment of liver function."

Ubiquitin (Ub), a highly conserved small regulatory protein, commonly serves as a signal for target proteins that are recognized and degraded in proteasomes. The rapid degradation of Ub‑mediated antigens results in efficient stimulation of cell‑mediated immune responses. Thus, the Ub‑HBV core antigen (HBcAg)‑cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP) fusion protein was designed for specific delivery of a foreign modified antigen to the cytoplasm of antigen‑presenting cells. HBV transgenic mice were used to determine whether Ub‑HBcAg‑CTP would restore HBV‑specific immune responses and anti‑viral immunity in these animals. The results demonstrated that synthesized Ub‑HBcAg‑CTP not only significantly increased the levels of interleukin‑2 and interferon (IFN)‑γ compared with those in the HBcAg‑CTP, IFN‑α, Ub‑HBcAg, HBcAg and phosphate‑buffered saline groups, but additionally induced the highest IFN‑γ+ CD8+ T‑cell numbers and HBV‑specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, indicating a strong immune response. In addition, enhancement of specific CTL activity provoked by the fusion protein reduced hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV DNA serum levels and diminished the expression of HBsAg and HBcAg in liver tissue of HBV transgenic mice, suggesting that there was a therapeutic effect. In conclusion, the present study provided evidence that Ub‑HBcAg‑CTP activated the Th1‑dependent immunity, triggered functional T cell responses and subsequently inhibited viral replication in HBV transgenic mice. These observations suggested that the fusion protein may represent an innovative and promising candidate for active immunotherapy during chronic and persistent HBV."

T lymphocytes and their cytokines are believed to have a pivotal role in the defense against HCV and in allograft rejection. An immunosuppressive drug regimen may cause a cytokine imbalance toward a T helper (TH) cell type 2 profile that is associated with the persistence of infection and acceptance of the graft. The aim of this study is to assess whether cytokine imbalances toward a TH1- or TH2-type response may have a role in recurrent HCV infection and rejection after OLT. Twenty-one intrahepatic T-cell lines of 15 patients with recurrent HCV infection after OLT (group A) and 15 lines of 11 patients with rejection (group B) were studied. Both patient groups had received liver allografts because of HCV-associated end-stage liver disease. Patients with HCV-induced liver disease who did not undergo OLT served as controls: 17 patients with chronic hepatitis C (CH-C) and 8 patients with cirrhosis. At the time of liver biopsy, 14 blood-derived T-cell lines of 12 patients with recurrent HCV infection, 7 of 10 patients with rejection, and 18 of 18 control patients were also investigated. Regardless of the underlying disease (recurrent HCV infection, rejection, HCV-induced hepatitis, and cirrhosis), all liver tissue-derived T-cell lines produced interferon-gamma; some additionally produced interleukin-4 (IL-4), but none produced IL-10, indicating that the TH0/1 cytokine profile dominates. T-cell lines showing a TH1 cytokine profile derived from intrahepatic T cells could be established significantly more often in recurrent HCV infection and rejection than in controls with CH-C (Fisher's exact test, P <.05). The cytokine profile of intrahepatic T cells did not differ from that obtained in peripheral blood. TH0/1 cytokine profile dominates the intrahepatic and blood-derived immune response in recurrent HCV infection and rejection after OLT regardless of the mode of immunosuppression. The lymphokine profile of immunocompromised patients with recurrent HCV infection or rejection does not differ principally from that of patients with HCV-induced hepatitis and cirrhosis, but seems to show a TH1 profile significantly more often."

18869,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, with approximately 170-200 million people infected. The HCV virus is transmitted by blood and blood products and such transmission occurs primarily through drug use by injection, sex with an infected partner and occupational exposure. The severity of the disease varies widely from mild chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nowadays, the reference treatment is combination therapy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin, which is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor and immunomodulator. Efficacy of treatment in our clinical trials is 87% in patients infected by HCV genotypes 2 or 3, whereas in patients infected by HCV genotype 1 response to treatment is 66%. The current combination treatment has significant side-effects and sometimes is poorly tolerated. HCV genotypes 2 or 3 can be treated with a lower dose of ribavirin and a shorter course of therapy, 24 weeks vs 48 weeks for patients with genotype 1. There is a growing consensus that acute control of HCV infection is associated with a vigorous intrahepatic antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response, enhanced Th1 and natural killer activity. Pretreatment genotype and response to therapy measured at weeks 12 and 24 of treatment have been identified as key determinants in decisions about continuing treatment. Elevated serum ferritin levels and hepatic iron deposition as well as hepatic steatosis and high ALT levels with chronic hepatitis C are risk factors for HCC development. Heterozygosityfor the C282Y mutation in HFE contributes to iron accumulation and fibrosis progression in chronic hepatitis C. Ribavirin could cause dose-dependent reversible haemolytic anaemia, which can be managed with dose reductions or with administration of epoetin alpha at 40,000 IU once weekly without sacrificing the optimal dosing of ribavarin. Among patients who received ribavirin alone, serum ALT levels and necroinflammatory features of liver histology were improved, whereas symptoms, HCV RNA levels and hepatic fibrosis scores were not changed significantly from baseline. For HCV-HIV co-infected patients, treatment is given when blood CD4 counts are above 350/ml and before antiretroviral (ART) treatment is needed."

It has been postulated as early as 1991 that potent community-wide treatment of HIV infection could paradoxically lead to an increased spread of the HIV epidemic if treatment is not associated with a reduced infectivity of HIV. In the past few years, several groups have demonstrated a good correlation of the quantity of HIV present in semen with factors that are known to increase the likelihood of sexual transmission of HIV. A similar correlation has recently been demonstrated for the presence of HIV in female genital secretions. During the past year, a number of studies have demonstrated a marked effect of antiretroviral treatment on the shedding of HIV in the male and female genital tract, indicating a potential role of antiretroviral treatment for the prevention of HIV infection. Although potent antiretroviral therapy is beneficial on a public health basis, patients with no detectable virus in their blood or semen under treatment should not be considered non-infectious and patients should keep up with safer sex practices."

Understanding previous HIV testing patterns among persons recently diagnosed with HIV infection can help in the design of HIV testing strategies that reduce the time between onset of HIV infection and its diagnosis. To assess previous HIV testing patterns among adults and adolescents newly diagnosed with HIV infection, CDC analyzed data for the period 2006-2009 from 18 jurisdictions participating in HIV incidence surveillance through CDC's National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS).† This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that among adults and adolescents for whom testing history information (THI) was available, 41% were diagnosed with HIV infection at their first HIV test, and 59% had a negative test at some point before HIV diagnosis. Groups with the highest percentage of persons testing HIV-negative ≤12 months before HIV diagnosis included those aged 13-29 years (33%), males with HIV transmission attributed to male-to-male sexual contact (29%), and whites (28%). These results demonstrate that many persons diagnosed with HIV infection have never been tested previously. Persons who are unaware of their HIV infection might not change their behavior to reduce the risk for transmission and will not be linked to care, resulting in worse health outcomes. Enhanced efforts are needed to increase annual HIV testing for populations at high risk for HIV infection to increase early detection."

HTLV-1 transmission occurs by transmission of infected cells via breast-feeding by infected mothers, sexual intercourse, and contaminated blood products. The route of exposure and early virus replication events are believed to be key determinants of virus-associated spread, antiviral immune responses, and ultimately disease outcomes. The lack of knowledge of early events of HTLV-1 spread following blood-borne transmission of the virus in vivo hinders a more complete understanding of the immunopathogenesis of HTLV-1 infections. Herein, we have used an established animal model of HTLV-1 infection to study early spatial and temporal events of the viral infection. Twelve-week-old rabbits were injected intravenously with cell-associated HTLV-1 (ACH-transformed R49). Blood and tissues were collected at defined intervals throughout the study to test the early spread of the infection. Antibody and hematologic responses were monitored throughout the infection. HTLV-1 intracellular Tax and soluble p19 matrix were tested from ex vivo cultured lymphocytes. Proviral copy numbers were measured by real-time PCR from blood and tissue mononuclear leukocytes. Our data indicate that intravenous infection with cell-associated HTLV-1 targets lymphocytes located in both primary lymphoid and gut-associated lymphoid compartments. A transient lymphocytosis that correlated with peak virus detection parameters was observed by 1 week postinfection before returning to baseline levels. Our data support emerging evidence that HTLV-1 promotes lymphocyte proliferation preceding early viral spread in lymphoid compartments to establish and maintain persistent infection."

By nested PCR amplification of the C2V3 env gene region, HIV-1 has been found to infect the placenta in five cases (33%). Phylogenetic analysis of the cloned sequences showed that all recovered maternal variants were of the B subtype. Further investigation into the ancestral relationships at the nucleotide level revealed that the trophoblast sequences evolved into a quasispecies population clearly distant from that observed in the mother. As expected, the populations transmitted to the trophoblast were also found to be more homogeneous than those in the mothers when characterized on the basis of pairwise nucleotide sequence distances. With regard to the predicted biological properties, the primary amino acid structure of the V3 loop domain was consistent, with a macrophage-tropic, non-syncytium-inducing phenotype in all patients. We also attempted to determine if any of a number of selected maternal or viral factors was associated with trophoblast infection. However, none of the followed parameters, including maternal age, disease stage, antiretroviral therapy, CCR5delta32 deletion status of the infant, and viral genotype, could be associated with viral transmission. Moreover, in one pair with proven trophoblast infection, HIV was also detected in the cord blood. Taken together, our data suggest that the productive trophoblast infection by HIV-1 in vivo is a relatively frequent event that may bear direct implications for a further transplacental propagation of the virus."

Anti-HCV seropositive women were further tested with western blot and polymerase chain reaction for HCV-RNA. Thirty-five (0.94%) of the 3712 pregnant women were found anti-HCV positive. 20% of them had present or previous injection drug abuse, hereof one patient had an associated seropositivity for HIV. Parenteral transmission through blood transfusion was likely in 11%. However, no parenteral exposure was recognized in 57% of the anti-HCV positive patients. The presence of serum HCV-RNA was detected in 16 (57%) of the 28 patients tested. In 17% (6/35) of the anti-HCV positive pregnancies elevated liver enzymes were noted, which did not show any significant change during the course of pregnancy. In conclusion, the prevalence of hepatitis C in pregnancy is relatively high with nearly 1%-comparable to chronic hepatitis B infection. Selected pregnancy screening based on perceived high-risk groups alone fail to detect about 60% of HCV antibody-positive women. Pregnancy did not influence the course of hepatitis C."

Therapy for HBV infection in HIV-coinfected patients requires several factors to be taken into consideration, such as whether the antiviral activity of a particular agent is specific for HBV (that is, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine and pegylated interferon) or for both viruses (that is, lamivudine, emtricitabine and tenofovir), whether the chosen drug has the potential for inducing drug resistance and cross-resistance, and whether use of the agent is associated with hepatotoxicity. For coinfected patients who do not require therapy for their HIV infection, clinicians should avoid prescribing monotherapy with agents that have activity against HIV (that is, tenofovir, entecavir, emtricitabine or lamivudine) so as not to compromise future HIV care. This review discusses the current status of treatment of hepatitis B in the setting of HIV infection. It describes emerging therapeutic strategies and addresses challenges in the treatment of coinfection."

This Clinical Practice Guideline presents updated recommendations for the optimal management of HBV infection. Chronic HBV infection can be classified into five phases: (I) HBeAg-positive chronic infection, (II) HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis, (III) HBeAg-negative chronic infection, (IV) HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis and (V) HBsAg-negative phase. All patients with chronic HBV infection are at increased risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), depending on host and viral factors. The main goal of therapy is to improve survival and quality of life by preventing disease progression, and consequently HCC development. The induction of long-term suppression of HBV replication represents the main endpoint of current treatment strategies, while HBsAg loss is an optimal endpoint. The typical indication for treatment requires HBV DNA >2,000IU/ml, elevated ALT and/or at least moderate histological lesions, while all cirrhotic patients with detectable HBV DNA should be treated. Additional indications include the prevention of mother to child transmission in pregnant women with high viremia and prevention of HBV reactivation in patients requiring immunosuppression or chemotherapy. The long-term administration of a potent nucleos(t)ide analogue with high barrier to resistance, i.e., entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide, represents the treatment of choice. Pegylated interferon-alfa treatment can also be considered in mild to moderate chronic hepatitis B patients. Combination therapies are not generally recommended. All patients should be monitored for risk of disease progression and HCC. Treated patients should be monitored for therapy response and adherence. HCC remains the major concern for treated chronic hepatitis B patients. Several subgroups of patients with HBV infection require specific focus. Future treatment strategies to achieve 'cure' of disease and new biomarkers are discussed."

A treatment algorithm for the management of this disease, published previously by a panel of U.S. hepatologists, has been revised on the basis of new developments in the understanding of the disorder, the availability of more sensitive molecular diagnostic tests, and the licensure of new therapies. In addition, a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of new treatments has led to the development of strategies for reducing the rate of resistance associated with oral agents and optimizing treatment outcomes. This updated algorithm was based primarily on available evidence by using a systematic review of the literature. Where data were lacking, the panel relied on clinical experience and consensus expert opinion. The primary aim of antiviral therapy is durable suppression of serum HBV DNA to low or undetectable levels. Assays can now detect serum HBV DNA at levels as low as 10 IU/mL and should be used to establish a baseline level, monitor response to antiviral therapy, and survey for the development of drug resistance. Interferon alfa-2b, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, peginterferon alfa-2a, telbivudine, and tenofovir are approved as initial therapy for chronic hepatitis B and have certain advantages and disadvantages. Although all of these agents can be used in selected patients, the preferred first-line treatment choices are entecavir, peginterferon alfa-2a, and tenofovir.

The current study investigated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and/or emtricitabine [(-)-FTC] alone and in combination therapy for HBV infection utilizing the HepAD38 system (human hepatoblastoma cells transfected with HBV). Cellular pharmacology studies demonstrated increased levels of (-)-FTC triphosphate with coincubation of increasing concentrations of TDF, while (-)-FTC had no effect on intracellular tenofovir (TFV) diphosphate levels. Quantification of extracellular HBV by real-time PCR from hepatocytes demonstrated the anti-HBV activity with TDF, (-)-FTC, and their combination. Combination of (-)-FTC with TDF or TFV (ratio, 1:1) had a weighted average combination index of 0.7 for both combination sets, indicating synergistic antiviral effects. No cytotoxic effects were observed with any regimens. Using an in vivo murine model which develops robust HBV viremia in nude mice subcutaneously injected with HepAD38 cells, TDF (33 to 300 mg/kg of body weight/day) suppressed virus replication for up to 10 days posttreatment. At 300 mg/kg/day, (-)-FTC strongly suppressed virus titers to up to 14 days posttreatment. Combination therapy (33 mg/kg/day each drug) sustained suppression of virus titer/ml serum (<1 log(10) unit from pretreatment levels) at 14 days posttreatment, while single-drug treatments yielded virus titers 1.5 to 2 log units above the initial virus titers. There was no difference in mean alanine aminotransferase values or mean wet tumor weights for any of the groups, suggesting a lack of drug toxicity.

Early initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART) and the duration of ART have been associated with immune reconstitution. Here, we evaluated whether restoration of CD8+ T cell function in HIV-1-infected individuals was dependent on early initiation of ART. HIV-specific CD107a, IFNγ, IL-2, TNFα and MIP-1β expression by CD8+ T cells and the frequency of CD8+ T cells expressing PD-1, 2B4 and CD160 were measured by flow cytometry. The frequency of CD8+ T cells expressing the inhibitory markers PD-1, 2B4 and CD160 was lower in ART-treated individuals compared with ART-naïve individuals and similar to the frequency in HIV-uninfected controls. The expression of the three markers was similarly independent of when therapy was initiated. Individuals treated before seroconversion displayed an HIV-specific CD8+ T cell response that included all five functional markers; this was not observed in individuals treated after seroconversion or in ART-naïve individuals. In summary, ART appears to restore the total CD8+ T cell population to a less exhausted phenotype, independent of the time point of initiation. However, to preserve multifunctional, HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells, ART might have to be initiated before seroconversion. "

Though effective antiretroviral treatments have dramatically reduced death rates in the United States and Canada, HIV-infected people face a lifetime of vigilant polypharmacy to control HIV and associated complications. Malnutrition, various forms of tissue wasting, fat accumulation, increased lipid levels, and risk of additional chronic disease have become central issues in health care plans.

During the period specified, a total of 4,858 HIV-infected patients receiving HAART and 2,787 HIV-infected individuals not receiving HAART were studied. The frequency of fever of unknown origin was 0.6% in patients receiving HAART and 3% in non-HAART patients (P=0.001). Human immunodeficiency virus infection was the only cause of fever found more frequently in the non-HAART patient group (P=0.07).

MAIT cells appear to undergo exhaustion in chronic viral infections. However, their role in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mono-infection and HIV/tuberculosis (TB) co-infection have seldom been elaborately investigated.

Our data revealed that the frequency of MAIT cells was severely depleted in HIV mono- and HIV/TB co-infections. Further, PD-1 expression on MAIT cells was significantly increased in HIV mono- and HIV-TB co-infected patients. The frequency of MAIT cells did not show any significant increase despite the initiation of ART and/or ATT. Majority of the MAIT cells in HCs showed a significant increase in CCR6 expression as compared to HIV/TB co-infections. No marked difference was seen with expressions of chemokine co-receptor CCR5 and CD103 among the study groups. Decrease of CCR6 expression appears to explain why HIV-infected patients display weakened mucosal immune responses."

We quantified the frequency of monocyte subsets (CD14, CD16), markers of monocyte activation (CD38, HLA-DR), and endothelial adhesion (CCR2, CX3CR1, CD11b) by flow cytometry. Plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide, sCD163, sCD14, sCX3CL1, and sCCL2, were measured by ELISA. Genotyping of TLR4 and CD14 SNPs was also performed. The TT genotype for CD14/-260SNP but not the CC/CT genotype was associated with elevated plasma sCD14, and increased frequency of CD11b+CD14+ monocytes in HIV-infected individuals. The TT genotype was associated with lower cIMT in HIV-infected patients (n = 47) but not in HIV-uninfected controls (n = 37). The AG genotype for TLR4/+896 was associated with increased CX3CR1 expression on total monocytes among HIV-infected individuals and increased sCCL2 and fibrinogen levels in HIV-uninfected controls. SNPs in CD14/-260 and TLR4/+896 were significantly associated with different markers of systemic and monocyte activation and cIMT that differed between HIV-infected participants on ART and HIV-uninfected controls.

Although NO synthesis and iNOS expression in macrophages affect several aspects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type-1 pathogenesis, their role in HIV disease remains largely unknown. In humans, the expression of iNOS is influenced by a functional CCTTT-repeat polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene. We investigated the association of this polymorphism with HIV pathogenesis in naive HIV-infected patients before the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. The allele frequencies of the iNOS CCTTT-repeat polymorphism were assessed by PCR in 857 patients from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, including rapid progressors and long-term nonprogressors, and in 240 healthy volunteers. In HIV-infected patients, the initial viral load and the decline in total CD4 cells was calculated to estimate disease progression. Allele frequencies of the iNOS CCTTT-repeat polymorphism were similar between the HIV-infected and noninfected blood donors. In treatment-naive HIV-positive patients, there was no association of the iNOS polymorphism with viral load or with the course of CD4 cells. Regulation of iNOS expression by the functional CCTTT-polymorphism does not modify HIV pathogenesis."

The cross-sectional study included 331 HIV patients, diagnosed from 1983 to 2003. Oral swabs were performed, and Candida species were determined using ID 32C. Isolates were tested for antifungal susceptibility. Clinical and laboratory data were collected to identify the association with Candida colonization. In total, 161 Candida isolates were detected among 147 of the 331 patients (44%), independently of the time when HIV infection was diagnosed. Candida albicans strains represented 137 (85%) of the isolates, and were susceptible to all of the tested antifungal drugs. Among the non-C. albicans strains, six isolates were dose-dependently susceptible to fluconazole, nine to itraconazole, and seven to ketoconazole. The isolation of Candida was significantly higher in patients with virological failure (83/147; p 0.0002) and CD4(+) T-lymphocyte counts <200 cells/mm(3) (30/83; p 0.0003). Recovery of Candida in the oral cavity was independent of protease inhibitor (PI) usage (p 0.60). Colonized patients typically underwent salvage therapy (p 0.003), and had more episodes of opportunistic fungal infections (p 0.046) and malignancies (p 0.004).Oral Candida colonization in patients under ARV therapy was associated with the immunosupressed status of HIV-infected patients, i.e. low number of CD4(+) T-cells per cubic millimetre, failure of ARV therapy (salvage therapy), and higher number of opportunistic infections and malignancies. Despite the fact that PIs have in vitro antifungal activity, the use of this class of antiretroviral agent did not influence the presence of Candida in the oral cavity of AIDS patients."

No difference was found for total plasma or low-density cholesterol levels, nor for the prevalence of diabetes. Similar trends were observed among female subjects. The predicted risk of coronary heart disease was greater among HIV-1-infected men (relative risk [RR], 1.20) and women (RR, 1.59; P<10(-6) for both), compared with the HIV-1-uninfected cohort. The estimated attributable risks due to smoking were 65% and 29% for HIV-1-infected men and women, respectively. Because most HIV-1-infected people will ultimately need antiretroviral therapy, risk factors for cardiovascular disease should be determined at the initiation of treatment, and interventions should be considered for all patients who have them."

Although it was speculated that postinfection NAb induction could have only a limited suppressive effect on primary HIV replication, a recent study has shown that a single passive NAb immunization of rhesus macaques 1 week after SIV challenge can result in reduction of viral loads at the set point, indicating a possible contribution of postinfection NAb responses to virus control. However, the mechanism accounting for this NAb-triggered SIV control has remained unclear. Here, we report rapid induction of virus-specific polyfunctional T-cell responses after the passive NAb immunization postinfection. Analysis of SIV Gag-specific responses of gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-2, macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, and CD107a revealed that the polyfunctionality of Gag-specific CD4(+) T cells, as defined by the multiplicity of these responses, was markedly elevated in the acute phase in NAb-immunized animals. In the chronic phase, despite the absence of detectable NAbs, virus control was maintained, accompanied by polyfunctional Gag-specific T-cell responses. These results implicate virus-specific polyfunctional CD4(+) T-cell responses in this NAb-triggered virus control, suggesting possible synergism between NAbs and T cells for control of HIV/SIV replication."

Although methadone maintenance has been the OAT gold standard, methadone is available for the treatment of opioid dependence only in strictly regulated narcotic treatment programs.

Eleven of these patients had been treated with zidovudine before the start of the study. The median CD4 cell count at the start of lamivudine monotherapy was 200 x 10(6) cells/l. After a median interval of 69 weeks (range 23-102 weeks), the median CD4 cell count had dropped to 110 x 10(6) cells/l. Initial improvements in all laboratory markers for antiretroviral efficacy were observed after the addition of zidovudine. The median CD4 cell count remained 18% above baseline after 48 weeks of treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine, however plasma HTV-1 RNA load and CD4 cell counts returned towards baseline during prolonged treatment in most patients. The combination was well tolerated, although anaemia was observed in nine patients. Repeated measures analysis of variance suggested a superior effect of lamivudine monotherapy in patients who had previously used zidovudine. In conclusion, zidovudine was found to be effective in patients who have been treated with lamivudine.

Viral Tat protein is not only neurotoxic but has also been shown to disrupt the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Although the role of brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes in Tat-mediated impairment has been well documented, pericytes, which are important constituents of the BBB and play a key role in maintaining the integrity of the barrier, remain poorly studied in the context of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). In the present study, we demonstrated that exposure of human brain microvascular pericytes and C3H/10T1/2 cells to HIV-1 Tat101 resulted in increased expression of platelet-derived growth factor subunit B homodimer (PDGF-BB) and increased migration of the treated cells. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that this effect of Tat was mediated via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-κB pathways. Secreted PDGF-BB resulted in autocrine activation of the PDGF-BB/PDGF β receptor signaling pathway, culminating ultimately into increased pericyte migration. Ex vivo relevance of these findings was further corroborated in isolated microvessels of HIV Tg26 mice that demonstrated significantly increased expression of PDGF-BB in isolated brain microvessels with a concomitant loss of pericytes. Intriguingly, loss of pericyte coverage was also detected in sections of frontal cortex from humans with HIV-encephalitis compared with the uninfected controls. These findings thus implicate a novel role of PDGF-BB in the migration of pericytes, resulting in loss of pericyte coverage from the endothelium with a subsequent breach of the BBB. "

In the current study, experimental infection conditions to analyse the role of Vpr, independently of MA, during infection of PHA/IL-2-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were designed. It was shown that the absence of Vpr results in a subtle effect on virus production in long-term infection. PCR analysis of the steps of virus retrotranscription during a single cycle of replication in stimulated PBMC revealed that the absence of Vpr alone correlates with an impairment in the nuclear localization of viral DNA. Our data indicate that Vpr is involved in the virus life-cycle during infection of dividing PBMC, presumably as it is during infection of MDMs."

The cytokines and host factors that determine the host cell restriction against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are not well understood. We screened 36 cytokines and chemokines to determine which were able to reduce the susceptibility of HepaRG cells to HBV infection. Here, we found that pretreatment with IL-1β and TNFα remarkably reduced the host cell susceptibility to HBV infection. This effect was mediated by activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. A cytidine deaminase, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), was up-regulated by both IL-1β and TNFα in a variety of hepatocyte cell lines and primary human hepatocytes. Another deaminase APOBEC3G was not induced by these proinflammatory cytokines. Knockdown of AID expression impaired the anti-HBV effect of IL-1β, and overexpression of AID antagonized HBV infection, suggesting that AID was one of the responsible factors for the anti-HBV activity of IL-1/TNFα. Although AID induced hypermutation of HBV DNA, this activity was dispensable for the anti-HBV activity. The antiviral effect of IL-1/TNFα was also observed on different HBV genotypes but not on hepatitis C virus. These results demonstrate that proinflammatory cytokines IL-1/TNFα trigger a novel antiviral mechanism involving AID to regulate host cell permissiveness to HBV infection. "

There is a complex, combined effect of HIV infection plus antiretroviral treatment on the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms, and, for some trials, the majority of gastrointestinal adverse events may not be related to antiretroviral treatment. Antiretroviral treatment can lead to improvements in gastrointestinal symptoms for patients with advanced immunosuppression. This was observed in the TORO trials of enfuvirtide and the DUET trials of etravirine, which were conducted in highly treatment experienced patients with low baseline CD4 counts. While antiretroviral treatment can improve immune function, leading to fewer gastrointestinal symptoms, this could be counter-balanced by adverse gastrointestinal toxicity profiles from certain antiretrovirals. Ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors show a range of gastrointestinal side effects; there are differences in tolerability within this class of antiretrovirals, influenced both by the dose of ritonavir used and the choice of boosted protease inhibitor. Overall, lopinavir/ritonavir and fosamprenavir/ritonavir tend to show the highest rates of drug-related grade 2-4 diarrhea, compared with atazanavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, or saquinavir/ritonavir. Of the nucleoside analogs, zidovudine leads to a well-characterized problem of nausea. Issues relating to gastrointestinal complications are often subjective, reliant upon patient reporting and perception, along with clinician interaction and intervention. In trial publications, many different systems are used to present gastrointestinal adverse events. Most are based on the US Division of AIDS Grading Scale, ranging from grade 1 (mild) to grade 4 (life-threatening). Clinical trials most commonly report grade 2-4 gastrointestinal adverse events, which are at least possibly related to study medication. In future, it is important for clinical trials to report gastrointestinal adverse events in a consistent way. The percentage of patients with drug-related grade 2-4 events should be reported. In addition, the percentage with any grade 2-4 gastrointestinal adverse event should be included, since there could be subjectivity in the assessment of drug relatedness in open-label clinical trials. The percentage of patients who use medications to lessen the symptoms of diarrhea and other gastrointestinal adverse events should also be reported."

In 3 patients the therapy concluded, after 19, 61 and 62 weeks, respectively. One patient after 4 weeks of treatment reported increasingly troublesome small joints pain and swelling, which forced leuHuIFN alpha (ldou) discontinuation after 19 weeks. In no patient transaminases normalization was seen during treatment; biochemical and clinical remission after the drug discontinuation was observed in only one patient, in whom the treatment was interrupted due to articular adverse symptoms.

All laboratory confirmed STI-episodes were recorded since the date of first consultation at our clinic, until the date of HCV-diagnosis of the cases. The HCV incidence varied between 0.24 (2001) and 1.36 (2011) new cases per hundred person-years, with a peak of 2.93 new cases per hundred person-years in 2009. The number of STI-episodes per person-year follow-up was significantly higher for the cases as compared to the controls for syphilis, non-LGV and LGV Chlamydia infections (p < 0.005). When considering the incidence of STIs that occurred 1 year prior to HCV conversion, all laboratory confirmed STIs remained more frequent among cases, but only the difference in syphilis incidence was statistically significant (p < 0.01). Recurrent STIs among HIV positive MSM should be considered as a behavioural and biological risk factor for acquiring HCV and should lead to intensified screening for HCV and counselling of the patient.

The objective of the study was to compare a second course of IFN-alpha therapy (9 million units [MU] of IFN-alpha-2a, Roferon-A, thrice weekly for 6 months) versus no therapy in terms of loss of HBV DNA and HBeAg. At the end of the study, a sustained clearance of HBV DNA and HBeAg was observed in 9 of the 27 (33.3%) patients who had received retreatment with IFN-alpha compared with 3/30 (10%) patients who spontaneously cleared these markers in the untreated control group (chi2 = 4.66, P =.031; odds ratio: 4.5, 95%; confidence interval: 1.1-18.9). None of the responders lost HBsAg. Patients retreated with IFN-alpha were more likely to have biochemical remission in association with HBV clearance (5/27, 18.5%) compared with untreated patients (1/30, 3. 3%; Fisher's exact test P =.09 ). Histological improvement in the liver necroinflammatory activity was observed among sustained responders to IFN-alpha retreatment, consisting of regression of the portal and periportal inflammation and of the piecemeal necrosis; there was no change in the degree of liver fibrosis. Side effects were similar to those previously reported during IFN-alpha treatment; these were mild and reversible on IFN-alpha discontinuation. None of the baseline features were associated with response by Cox's regression analysis. In summary, viremic patients with chronic HBeAg-positive hepatitis may experience disease remission following retreatment with IFN-alpha. Thus, retreatment with IFN-alpha may be considered a therapeutic option."

This was an open-label, randomized, controlled, ""real-life"" trial. HBeAg-positive CHB patients with serum HBV DNA ≥5.0 lg IU/mL and a < 1 lg IU/mL decline of HBsAg level from baseline who underwent at least 24 weeks of Peg-IFNα-2a therapy were included. Enrolled patients were randomized to receive either telbivudine (600 mg/d, n = 95) or entecavir (0.5 mg/d, n = 95) for 208 consecutive weeks. Six patients were lost to follow-up (4 patients in the telbivudine group and 2 in the entecavir group). Treatment was combined with adefovir when week 24 HBV DNA levels declined to <2 lg IU/mL versus baseline, when viral breakthrough occurred during treatment,or when HBV DNA remained detectable at 52 weeks (HBV DNA ≥500 IU/mL). Responses and safety were assessed after 208 weeks of treatment. There were no significant differences among the baseline characteristics, including age, gender, and ALT, HBV DNA, HBsAg or HBeAg levels. After 208 weeks of treatment, there was no significant difference in the rates of undetectable HBV DNA (HBV DNA<500 IU/mL) between the telbivudine group and the entecavir group (84/91,92.31% vs 88/93,94.62%, respectively, P = .525). More patients in the telbivudine group than the entecavir group achieved HBeAg clearance (74.73% vs 46.24%, respectively, P < .001) and HBeAg seroconversion (64.84% vs 38.71%, respectively, P < .001). Univariate analysis (Enter, a = 0.05) of both groups showed that telbivudine, male gender and baseline HBeAg levels were significantly correlated with HBeAg seroconversion after 208 weeks of sequential therapy. Cox regression analysis (Enter, a = 0.05) of the telbivudine group showed that the HBeAg seroconversion rate at 208 weeks was significantly correlated with gender (male) (P = .006, HR=4.406), baseline HBeAg level (P = .005, HR=0.433) and 24 w-HBeAg level reduction of more than 0.5 lg IU/ml from baseline (P = .027, HR=0.487). All patients tolerated sequential telbivudine treatment; only slightly elevated creatine kinase levels were observed. Stratification analysis found that patients with baseline HBeAg levels less than 3 lg COI who switched to telbivudine may have had significantly improved HBeAg seroconversion rates. In conclusion, telbivudine promotes HBeAg seroconversion that merits investigation in HBeAg-positive CHB patients with suboptimal responses to 24 weeks of Peg-IFNα-2a therapy. We would suggest that patients with baseline HBeAg levels under 3 lg COI switch to telbivudine to achieve higher HBeAg seroconversion rates and use the early reductions in HBeAg levels (24 weeks) to guide treatment."

Findings defining the direct relationship between the quality of drug abuse treatment and the patients' program completion, the perception of the staff by the patient, feelings of self-empowerment and mitigation of patient and organizational readiness, the superiority of integrated care, and the primary reasons for delays in HIV-infected substance-using patients seeking care are included. More needs to be done to increase the participation of substance abuse programs in teaching about and implementing HIV prevention and developing means to modulate or eliminate barriers to the integration of HIV and substance abuse care."
17896,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Adherence continues to be a major barrier to successful treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV-infected individuals. HIV-infected adolescents and young adults face a lifetime of treatment with HAART. Often, individuals who struggle with adherence to HAART face multiple barriers that would therefore impact on the success of any single modality intervention. Thus, we conducted a cross-sectional, observational study to determine the prevalence of personal barriers to adherence and to identify associations between these barriers in HIV-infected subjects, 12 to 24. We studied the following personal barriers to adherence: mental health barriers, high/low self-efficacy and outcome expectancy, and the presence of specific structural barriers. There were 396 subjects infected after age 9 recruited from sites from the Adolescent Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions or the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group. Of the 396 subjects, 148 (37.4%) self-identified as nonadherent. No significant differences were found between adherent and nonadherent subjects for the presence of mental health disorders. Adherence was significantly associated with all but one structural barrier. Both self-efficacy and outcome expectancy were higher among adherent versus nonadherent subjects (p < 0.0001). Grouping subjects according to low self-efficacy and outcome expectancy for adherence, adherence differed according to the presence or absence of mental health disorders and structural barriers (p < 0.0001). Our data suggest that adolescents have significant rates of non-adherence and face multiple personal barriers. Adherence interventions must address multiple barriers to have the maximum chance for positive effects."

We compared different adherence monitoring tools in predicting virologic failure as part of a clinical trial. HIV-infected Thai and Cambodian children aged 1-12 years (N=207) were randomized to immediate-ART or deferred-ART until CD4% <15%. Virologic failure (VF) was defined as HIV-RNA >1000 copies/mL after ≥6 months of ART. Adherence monitoring tools were: (1) announced pill count, (2) PACTG adherence questionnaire (form completed by caregivers), and (3) child self-report (self-reporting from children or caregivers to direct questioning by investigators during the clinic visit) of any missed doses in the last 3 days and in the period since the last visit. The Kappa statistic was used to describe agreement between each tool. The median age at ART initiation was 7 years with median CD4% 17% and HIV-RNA 5.0 log(10)copies/mL and 92% received zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine. Over 144 weeks, 13% had VF. Mean adherence by announced pill count before VF in VF children was 92% compared to 98% in children without VF (p=0.03). Kappa statistics indicated slight to fair agreement between tools. In multivariate analysis adjusting for gender, treatment arm ethnicity and caregiver education, significant predictors of VF were poor adherence by announced pill count (OR 4.56; 95%CI 1.78-11.69), reporting any barrier to adherence in the PACTG adherence questionnaire (OR 7.08; 95%CI 2.42-20.73), and reporting a missed dose in the 24 weeks since the last HIV-RNA assessment (OR 8.64; 95%CI 1.96-38.04). In conclusion, we recommend the child self-report of any missed doses since last visit for use in HIV research and in routine care settings, because it is easy and quick to administer and a strong association with development of VF."

This paper describes the challenges, methods, and baseline sample of the Housing and Health Study, a longitudinal, multi-site, randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of providing immediate rental housing assistance to PLWHA who were homeless or at severe risk of homelessness. Primary outcomes included HIV disease progression, medical care access and utilization, treatment adherence, mental and physical health, and risks of transmitting HIV. Across three study sites, 630 participants completed baseline sessions and were randomized to receive either immediate rental housing assistance (treatment group) or assistance finding housing according to local standard practice (comparison group). Baseline sessions included a questionnaire, a two-session HIV risk-reduction counseling intervention, and blood sample collection to measure CD4 counts and viral load levels. Three follow-up visits occurred at 6, 12, and 18 months after baseline. Participants were mostly male, Black, unmarried, low-income, and nearly half were between 40 and 49 years old. At 18 months, 84% of the baseline sample was retained. The retention rates demonstrate the feasibility of conducting scientifically rigorous housing research, and the baseline results provide important information regarding characteristics of this understudied population that can inform future HIV prevention and treatment efforts."

In addition, the prevalence of HBV and HIV co-infection is estimated to be significantly higher among APIs in the US than in other racial/ethnic groups. High rates of HIV and hepatitis B or C (HBV and/or HCV) co-infection, in concert with language and cultural barriers, create significant challenges to effective coordination of treatment. The purpose of this study is to identify barriers to care and treatment in APIs with HIV with and without hepatitis co-infection. Specifically, we analyze results from semi-structured interviews with health care providers (N=23) and Asian Americans who are HIV and hepatitis (HBV and/or HCV) co-infected (N =17) in order to clarify how stigma in particular may impede/limit access to coordinated health care provision. Providers and clients recognize the need for integrated, culturally and linguistically appropriate access to care while simultaneously acknowledging that stigma is a severe barrier to access to care. This article sheds light on the complexities of the stigma experienced by HIV and hepatitis co-infected Asian Americans and suggests a need for further research and renewed efforts by caregivers to reduce stigma in these communities."

The US prison population is reported to have elevated rates of HIV, hepatitis and most psychiatric disorders. This study examined the association of six major psychiatric disorders with HIV mono-infection, HIV/HCV co-infection and HIV/HBV co-infection in one of the nation's largest prison populations. The study population consisted of 370,511 Texas Department of Criminal Justice inmates who were incarcerated for any duration between January 1, 2003 and July 1, 2006. Information on medical conditions and sociodemographic factors was obtained from an institution-wide electronic medical information system. Offenders diagnosed with HIV mono-infection, HIV/HCV, HIV/HBV and all HIV combined exhibited elevated rates of major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, non-schizophrenic psychotic disorder and any psychiatric disorder. In comparison to offenders with HIV mono-infection, those with HIV/HCV co-infection had an elevated prevalence of any psychiatric disorder. This cross-sectional study's finding of positive associations between psychiatric disease and both HIV infection and hepatitis co-infection among Texas prison inmates holds both clinical and public health relevance. It will be important for future investigations to examine the extent to which psychiatric disorders serve as a barrier to medical care, communication with clinicians and adherence to prescribed medical regimens among both HIV-mono-infected and HIV/hepatitis-co-infected inmates."

This study examined the potential benefits of a brief future visualisation exercise during the encoding stage of a naturalistic PM task in 60 young adults (aged 19-24 years) with HIV disease. Participants were administered a brief clinical neuropsychological assessment, which included a standardised performance-based measure of time- and event-based PM. All participants were also given a naturalistic PM task in which they were asked to complete a mock medication management task when the examiner showed them the Grooved Pegboard Test during their neuropsychological evaluation. Participants were randomised into: (1) a visualisation condition in which they spent 30 sec imagining successfully completing the naturalistic PM task; or (2) a control condition in which they repeated the task instructions. Logistic regression analyses revealed significant interactions between clinical neurocognitive functions and visualisation. HIV positive (HIV+) participants with intact retrospective learning and/or low time-based PM demonstrated observable gains from the visualisation technique, while HIV+ participants with impaired learning and/or intact time-based PM did not evidence gains. Findings indicate that individual differences in neurocognitive ability moderate the response to visualisation in HIV+ young adults. The extent to which such cognitive supports improve health-related PM outcomes (e.g., medication adherence) remains to be determined."

Participants included 56 HIV seropositive individuals, 24 of whom met Frascati criteria for HAND, and 24 seronegative subjects who were comparable on age, education, ethnicity, and oral word reading. Each participant was administered a brief battery of well-validated measures of health literacy, including the Expanded Numeracy Scale (ENS), Newest Vital Sign (NVS), Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), and Brief Health Literacy Screen (BHLS). Results revealed significant omnibus differences on the ENS and NVS, which were driven by poorer performance in the HAND group. There were no significant differences on the REALM or the BHLS by HAND status. Among individuals with HAND, lower scores on the NVS were associated with greater severity of neurocognitive dysfunction (e.g., working memory and verbal fluency) and self-reported dependence in activities of daily living. These preliminary findings suggest that HAND hinders both fundamental (i.e., basic knowledge, such as numeracy) and critical (i.e., comprehension and application of healthcare information) health literacy capacities, and therefore may be an important factor in the prevalence of health illiteracy. Health literacy-focused intervention may play an important role in the treatment and health trajectories among persons living with HIV infection."

We present an analysis of neurological and neurocognitive function in antiretroviral naïve individuals in multinational resource-limited settings. This prospective multinational cohort study, a substudy of a large international randomized antiretroviral treatment trial, was conducted in seven low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and Asia. Subjects were HIV-infected and met regional criteria to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Standardized neurological examination and a brief motor-based neuropsychological examination were administered. A total of 860 subjects were studied. Overall 249 (29%) had one or more abnormalities on neurological examinations, but there was a low prevalence of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) and minor neurocognitive disorder (MND). Twenty percent of subjects had evidence of peripheral neuropathy. There were significant differences across countries (p < 0.001) in neuropsychological test performance. In this first multinational study of neurological function in antiretroviral naïve individuals in resource-limited settings, there was a substantial prevalence of peripheral neuropathy and low prevalence of dementia and other CNS diseases. There was significant variation in neurocognitive test performance and neurological examination findings across countries. These may reflect cultural differences, differences in HIV-related and unrelated diseases, and variations in test administration across sites. Longitudinal follow-up after antiretroviral treatment initiation may help to define more broadly the role of HIV in these differences as well as the impact of treatment on performance."

The spontaneous disappearance rates of HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA during a median follow-up of 125 months (range 1 to 320) were 3, 30.6, and 3%, respectively, figures lower than in the general population. A high rate of persistent viral replication (50%) and reactivation (30%) was noted. Noteworthy was the high frequency of histologic deterioration (85.3%), accompanied by cirrhosis in 28% and by hepatocellular carcinoma in 23% of the patients with cirrhosis. Co-infection by hepatitis C and B viruses was significantly associated with histologic worsening. Liver disease was the leading cause of death (36.6%), especially in patients with cirrhosis. Despite persistent viral replication, histopathologic deterioration, and liver-related overmortality, there were paradoxically no significant differences in the survival of these 151 HBsAg-positive compared with 1247 HBsAg-negative kidney recipients--however, allograft actuarial survival was better in the former than in the latter group (P=0.0006). Chronic hepatitis B infection is not a contraindication to renal transplantation in the absence of cirrhosis. The presence of cirrhosis should lead either to dialysis continuation or to a combined liver/kidney transplantation, in the absence of viral replication."

HIV-infected patients were more likely to be frail or prefrail than controls, and this association remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders (odds ratio, 3.79). After additional adjustment for neurocognitive impairment and depressive and insomnia symptoms, this association remained significant but attenuated (odds ratio, 2.16). In the HIV-infected group, these 3 variables were independently associated with prefrailty/frailty. These findings suggest that neurocognitive impairment and depressive and/or insomnia symptoms may account for a higher prevalence of prefrailty/frailty in HIV-infected patients but require further longitudinal investigation."

As a result, little is known about how clinical and sociodemographic factors are associated with survival, independent of AIDS diagnosis stage. By estimating survival following seroconversion while adjusting for baseline CD4 lymphocyte count, the present study generated survival determinants which were unconfounded by time-related changes in AIDS diagnosis. This study's findings indicate that the following factors were associated with significant decreases in HIV-related survival: older age; self-report of no known HIV transmission risk factors; and presence of cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium avium complex, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Furthermore, survival decreased in a monotonic fashion with decreases in baseline CD4 count and with increases in calendar period. While this study's findings are consistent with previous investigators' reports of AIDS survival determinants, it will be important for future investigators to refine and update estimates of HIV-related survival determinants as clinical care for HIV-infected patients continues to improve."

This article reviews studies relevant to the EU simeprevir label. In proof-of-concept studies, simeprevir had potent antiviral activity against all HCV genotypes, except genotype 3. In trials in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection, week-12 sustained virological response (SVR12) rates in treatment-naïve patients and prior relapsers were significantly higher with simeprevir plus peginterferon-α/ribavirin (PR) [79-89 %] than with placebo plus PR (36-62 %). In prior partial/null responders, the SVR12 rate with simeprevir plus PR (54 %) was noninferior to that with telaprevir plus PR (55 %). Simeprevir plus PR was also efficacious in patients with HCV genotype 1/HIV-1 co-infection. In prior null responders without severe liver fibrosis (cohort 1) and treatment-naïve patients with severe liver fibrosis (cohort 2) treated with simeprevir plus sofosbuvir, the SVR12 rate for the two cohorts combined was 92 %. In patients with chronic HCV genotype 4 infection, the SVR12 rates with simeprevir plus PR were 83, 87 and 40 % in treatment-naïve patients, prior relapsers and prior null responders, respectively. Grade 3-4 adverse event, serious adverse event and treatment withdrawal rates with simeprevir plus PR were similar to those with placebo plus PR. Skin rashes with simeprevir were mostly mild or moderate; serious photosensitivity reactions occur, but are rare. Simeprevir is efficacious and generally well tolerated in patients with chronic HCV genotypes 1 and 4 infection. Studies of simeprevir in interferon-free regimens and in other subpopulations with HCV infections will be of interest."

This is a retrospective study, conducted on medical data of hospitalized cases of patients with HIV infection in the ITDU at the teaching hospital of Treichville (Abidjan) from 2006 to 2007. During the two years, 447 patients were included in the study. Their average age was 39 years [18 years-86 years] and sex ratio was 0.69. Of the 447 patients, 35% were unemployed and 67% were new patients who had never undergone antiretroviral therapy (ART). The duration of drug exposure was less than 6 months in 59% of treated patients. The average time to initiate ART was seven weeks. Among naive patients 41.9% were lost to follow up, 35.9% were waiting for treatment and 22.1% waiting for baseline biological test to initiate ART. At the initiation of ART, 79.6% of patients had a CD4 count less than 200/mm(3). The reasons of hospitalization defining AIDS were dominated by tuberculosis (34.2%), cerebral toxoplasmosis (17.9%) and neuromeningeal cryptococcosis (8%). The main reasons of hospitalization in classifying non-AIDS were pyelonephritis (6.5%), bacterial pneumonia (5.4%) and undetermined infectious encephalitis (4.9%). Hospital mortality was 24.4%. The leading causes of death were tuberculosis (22.9%), cerebral toxoplasmosis (20.2%), undetermined infectious encephalitis (18.3%) and cryptococcal meningitis (13.7%). The profile of PLHIV in hospital is characterized by profound immunosuppression due to late diagnosis and high mortality associated with severe opportunistic infections and late initiation of ART."

The recurrence of HCV after OLT was determined by reverse transcriptase-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the sera and livers of 41 patients with OLT, 32 of whom underwent transplants for HCV or HBV-related disease. Results were compared with liver function tests, liver histology (including HBV immunohistochemistry), and antibody status. HCV PCR was more frequently positive in OLT patients with a history of HCV only (59%) than in those with a history of both HCV and HBV (41%) or no history of viral infection (2%). Recurrent HCV (60% overall) was associated with mild elevation of liver function tests and mild to moderate hepatitis. In patients who underwent transplants for both HCV and HBV disease, hepatitis on biopsy was more frequently associated with recurrent HBV than with recurrent HCV. We conclude that graft reinfection with HCV, which is frequent in OLT patients with or without HBV recurrence, is usually associated with only mild to moderate hepatitic changes compatible with graft survival."

For this reason, it has become essential to monitor survival and causes of death. We constructed a survival curve based on 597 adult patients notified as AIDS cases between 1997 and 2004, at the Hospital das Clínicas, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil. Among those patients, 150 (25%) progressed to death by December, 2005. Of these, 119 were studied in detail. The data were collected from notification files of the State Health Department and the State Mortality Information System, and were complemented by analysis of medical records. These 597 patients had a survival rate of 88%, 86% and 82% after one, two and five years, respectively, and a 75% likelihood of surviving to 1,984 days (66 months). Most of the deaths occurred during the first months after the diagnosis (median, 129 days). Patients who died were predominantly young men who had sexual exposure and came from Recife (the state capital) or its metropolitan region. When the patients were first seen, a large proportion had already presented severe signs of immunodeficiency. Comparing the patients within this group, the characteristics that were associated with lower survival were: male sex, hemoglobin < 10 mg/dL, lymphocytes < 1,000/mm(3), use of fewer therapeutic drugs and antiretroviral regimens and non-introduction of protease inhibitors. Most of them died from AIDS-related diseases, particularly undefined respiratory infections."

Our objectives were to examine HCV testing practices to determine which patient characteristics are associated with HCV testing and positivity, and to estimate the prevalence of HCV infection in a high-risk urban population. The study subjects were all patients included in the baseline phase of the Hepatitis C Assessment and Testing Project (HepCAT), a serial cross-sectional study of HCV screening strategies. We examined all patients with a clinic visit to Montefiore Medical Center from 1/1/08 to 2/29/08. Demographic information, laboratory data and ICD-9 diagnostic codes from 3/1/97-2/29/08 were extracted from the electronic medical record. Risk factors for HCV were defined based on birth date, ICD-9 codes and laboratory data. The prevalence of HCV infection was estimated assuming that untested subjects would test positive at the same rate as tested subjects, based on risk-factors. Of 9579 subjects examined, 3803 (39.7%) had been tested for HCV and 438 (11.5%) were positive. The overall prevalence of HCV infection was estimated to be 7.7%. Risk factors associated with being tested and anti-HCV positivity included: born in the high-prevalence birth-cohort (1945-64), substance abuse, HIV infection, alcohol abuse, diagnosis of cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease, and alanine transaminase elevation. In a high-risk urban population, a significant proportion of patients were tested for HCV and the prevalence of HCV infection was high. Physicians appear to use a risk-based screening strategy to identify HCV infection."
13579,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"High rates of coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) and the hepatitis B virus (HBV) are commonly found in at risk populations due to their shared parenteral route of transmission. Although the increasingly widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has prolonged survival for those with HIV, it has also increased the potential for morbidity and mortality from other diseases and opportunistic infections. Liver-related illness is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in those infected with HIV and HBV is responsible for a vast proportion of this, especially in regions of high HBV prevalence. HIV/HBV coinfected patients may exhibit atypical serological markers of HBV infection, hindering appropriate diagnosis. They may experience faster progression to cirrhosis, decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma than HBV-monoinfected patients. Rates of response to vaccine against HBV are abrogated in those with HIV, facilitating the spread of the virus. Treatment of HBV must be monitored for resistance, although newer agents appear to have less risk of resistance development. Moreover, treatment of HIV with antivirals must be monitored closely for liver toxicity. Because liver damage with HBV occurs via the immune response to the virus, liver damage is possible with HAART-mediated immune reconstitution. Although liver transplant is not commonly undertaken in HIV-positive patients, centers undertaking transplantation report improved survival and low rates of HBV recurrence."

Children who acquired HIV infection via transfusion had inapparent infection from 4 months to 5.7 years (median, 3.6 years). Actuarial survival following infection was not significantly different from maternally and transfusion-acquired infection; however, survival from infection was longer for children infected by transfusion beyond 2 years of age (mean, 7.5 years) than for children infected perinatally (mean, 5.6 years). The case-fatality ratio was 32%, with 25% of subjects succumbing within 1 year of developing an HIV-associated illness. Opportunistic infection was the most common acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining illness and the cause of death in 22 of the 35 children who died. Pneumocystis carinii and fungal pneumonias had the worst prognosis. Cryptosporidiosis and other opportunistic infections had a better prognosis. Because of difficulties in case finding, diagnosis of infection and variable survival of HIV-infected children, arge longitudinal studies and pooling of data among centers will be necessary to have an accurate understanding of the prognosis of individual clinical syndromes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In this study, our aim was to assess the degree of neurocognitive impairment in a group of randomly selected HIV-infected patients and investigate potential risk factors, including LPS plasma levels. Furthermore, we evaluated the relevance of LPS as a potential marker for screening patients with mild neurocognitive impairment. LPS plasma levels were compared among patients with HAND and those with no HAND. As LPS has also been shown to be elevated in hepatitis C co-infection, the analysis was stratified according to the presence or not of hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection. Differences between groups were evaluated using chi-square tests and Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric tests. Stepwise logistic regression was performed to identify independent risk factors for HAND in the subgroups of HCV-positive and negative patients. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Analyses were conducted using SPSS® software. From December 2007 to July 2009, 179 patients were tested (mean age 44, 73 % male, 87 % on treatment, 30 % HCV co-infected, median CD4 504/ml and 67 % with viral load below 40 copies/ml). HAND was identified in 40/179 patients (22 %), the majority displaying asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment or mild neurocognitive disorder. Univariate analysis showed that age, illicit drug use, hepatitis C co-infection, prior AIDS-defining events, CD4/CD8 ratio and LPS plasma levels were significantly associated with HAND. The median LPS level was 98.2 pg/ml in the non-HAND group versus 116.1 pg/ml in the HAND group (p < 0.014). No differences were found in LPS values between subgroups of impairment. There was a clear association between LPS levels and HAND in the HCV-positive group (p = 0.036), while there was none in the HCV-negative group (p = 0.502). No difference in degree of hepatic fibrosis was found between the HAND and non-HAND groups. In conclusion, LPS levels were associated with HAND in the HCV-positive group, while, in the HCV-negative group, age and pro-viral DNA were the only variables independently associated with HAND. There was no difference in degree of liver disease as predicted by score of fibrosis between HAND and non-HAND groups. The role of HCV co-infection and higher LPS levels in the pathogenesis of HAND in patients with viral suppression on treatment requires further investigation."

We were able to match 1295 HIV-1 infected patients who attended St Mary's Hospital between 1985 and 1991 with 1273 seronegative controls on gender, sexual orientation, injecting drug use and age at time of test. The cases were 3 times more likely to have a history of ever having had another STD than the controls: multivariate conditional logistic regression showed that, after controlling for sexual behaviour, for known sexual contact with an HIV infected individual or AIDS patient or with a resident from a high HIV prevalence area, area of residence and for year of test, a history of gonorrhoea, syphilis, hepatitis B, genital herpes or genital warts were all significantly associated with HIV-1 seropositive status. These findings reinforce the need for HIV containment strategies to be promoted in conjunction with containment programmes for others STDs."

Syphilis and other bacterial infections which may be encountered among IVDA were also investigated. It was found that all serum samples (of both groups) were negative for anti-HIV. Regarding HBV markers, the prevalence of HBc antibodies was significantly higher among IVDA (62%) than the control group (27.5%). Also HBsAg was detected in 16% of IVDA while it was 75% among the control group. Prevalence of anti-HCV was significantly higher among IVDA (63%) than the control group (27.5%). The prevalence of co-infection with HBV and HCV was significantly higher in IVDA (40%) than the control group (15%). Sharing of needles and duration of drug use were positively associated with the presence of both HBV markers and anti-HCV. CMV seroprevalence was high in both groups. Antibodies to Syphilis were found in sera of 3 IVDA and one control using MHA-TP test. Although HIV infection has not yet been sufficiently introduced among IVDA in Alexandria but potentials for its spread among addicts are high as supported by observation that other infections with similar mode of transmission are common among addicts."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate TCC-associated infection rates in patients with HIV infection (HIV+). Data were collected in 40 HIV + patients and 41 controls (C), and in 118 TCC (HIV+, 58; C, 60) for 28,146 catheter days (HIV+, 16,227; C, 11,919). There were no significant differences in the TCC bacteremia rates (HIV+, 2.23 versus C, 2.53 per 1000 TCC days, P: = NS) or in the TCC exit site infection rates (HIV+, 2.20 versus C, 2.24 per 1000 TCC days, P: = NS) between the groups. The number of TCC removed due to infection was also similar, (HIV+ versus C: 17 versus 15%, P: = NS). In the HIV+ group, the association of hepatitis B surface antigenemia with TCC exit site infection was dependent on the history of injection drug use. Black race was a significant risk factor for higher TCC exit site infection rates, whereas prophylactic antibiotic use and high CD4 count were significantly associated with lower TCC exit site infection rates. None of the factors significantly predicted bacteremia rate in either group (HIV+ or C). In comparison to controls, HIV+ patients had a fivefold increased risk of having a Gramnegative organism (P: = 0.02) and a sevenfold increased risk of a fungal isolate (P: = 0.08), although the latter finding was not statistically significant. HIV infection is not a significant risk factor for TCC-associated infection but is associated with a higher prevalence of Gram-negative and fungal species."

We explored the relation of socio-financial, physical and mental health factors (ASI) to risk behaviour (Qr23) for contracting blood-borne infections among IDUs (Addiction Severity Index and Questionnaire for risk behaviour). 42 HIV negative IDUs were studied prospectively. The median age was 42.5 (range 18-61) y, 28 of 42 (67%) were males and median duration of injecting was 19.0 (range 0-43) y. HCV and HBV antibodies were found in 37 (88%) and 31 (71%) participants, respectively. Poly drug use was reported by 23 (55%) participants; amphetamine by 10 (24%) and heroin by 9 (21%). From the ASI data we were unable to find any statistically significant factor that was associated with needle sharing (n = 26/42, 61%) or sharing drug mixture/filter (n = 25/42, 59%). 19 (73%) of 26 participants who shared needles also shared drug mixture/filter. Of these 26 IDUs, 7 shared needles with partners, 11 with acquaintances, 3 with strangers and 5 with all categories. In conclusion, the study group showed differentiated risk behaviours for blood-borne infections with regard to various persons and to whom they were exposed. This suggests that IDUs may benefit from individualized counselling regarding risks for infections with HIV, HCV and HBV."
1634,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Presented here are the results of a cohort study conducted on 3,483 consecutive HIV/AIDS patients between January 1993 and December 2000 to determine trends in AIDS incidence and presentation. The incidence of AIDS was calculated in the general population and examined further according to gender, age (< or = or >49 years), and heterosexual behaviour as a risk factor for HIV. Multivariate analysis was used to identify variables associated with AIDS presenters (defined as patients diagnosed with AIDS within 1 month of the first HIV-positive test). The numbers of patients with AIDS classified as (i) AIDS presenters, (ii) known HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral treatment, and (iii) known HIV-positive patients not receiving antiretroviral treatment were calculated. The overall incidence of AIDS decreased over time, mainly due to the lower number of patients on antiretroviral treatment developing AIDS. Factors associated with a higher risk of being an AIDS presenter were male gender and year of HIV diagnosis. Among patients with AIDS, the proportion of AIDS presenters increased from 13.8% prior to 1997 (when protease inhibitors were introduced in Italy) to 32.5% after 1997. Variables predictive of being an AIDS presenter were male gender, age at diagnosis, and AIDS diagnosis in the years 1997-2000. Heterosexuals had a higher risk of being AIDS presenters and a lower risk of being HIV-positive and not receiving antiretroviral treatment than intravenous drug users. In Italy, AIDS occurs mainly in subjects unaware of their HIV status (especially males, the elderly, and those infected heterosexually) or in patients refusing antiretroviral therapy (mainly intravenous drug users who do not refer to specialised centres)."

So a group of IDUs from two northeastern states (Mizoram and Nagaland) of India were studied to find the prevalence of HIV, co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and associated risk behaviors. Out of the 400 IDUs enrolled, 398 consented for HIV, HCV, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) test. Of them, 10.8% were HIV-1 antibody positive, 47.8% had HCV antibody, and 3.8% had detectable HBsAg. Among the HIV infected subjects, 79.1% were co-infected with HCV and 6.9% had triple infection. Heroin users showed a higher association with HIV (OR = 7.3, 95% CI: 2.5-21.5, p=0.0003) and HCV infection (OR = 7.6, 95% CI: 3.5-16.6, p<0.0001) than Spasmo-proxyvon (dextropropoxyphene, a synthetic opiod analgesic). In summary, apart from the known risk variables among IDUs, type of injecting drugs also influences the HIV/HCV transmission pattern among the IDUs."

No such change was observed for HIV-negative patients. The decrease in mortality is likely due to the more widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)."
13997,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"To understand the prevalence and evolution of drug resistant HIV strains in Henan China after the implementation of free antiretroviral therapy for AIDS patients. 45 drug naïve AIDS patients, 118 AIDS patients who received three months antiretroviral therapy and 124 AIDS patients who received six months antiretroviral treatment were recruited in the southern part of Henan province. Information on general condition, antiretroviral medicines, adherence and clinical syndromes were collected by face to face interview. Meanwhile, 14 ml EDTA anticoagulant blood was drawn. CD4/CD8 T cell count, viral load and genotypic drug resistance were tested. The rates of clinical improvement were 55.1% and 50.8% respectively three months and six months after antiretroviral therapy. The mean CD4 cell count after antiretroviral therapy was significantly higher than in drug naïve patients. The prevalence rate of drug resistant HIV strains were 13.9%, 45.4% and 62.7% in drug naïve patients, three month treatment patients and six month treatment patients, respectively. The number of resistance mutation codons and the frequency of mutations increased significantly with continued antiretroviral therapy. The mutation sites were primarily at the 103, 106 and 215 codons in the three-month treatment group and they increased to 15 codon mutations in the six-month treatment group. From this result, the evolution of drug resistant strains was inferred to begin with the high level NNRTI resistant strain, and then develop low level resistant strains to NRTIs. The HIV strains with high level resistance to NVP and low level resistance to AZT and DDI were highly prevalent because of the AZT+DDI+NVP combination therapy. These HIV strains were also cross resistant to DLV, EFV, DDC and D4T. Poor adherence to therapy was believed to be the main reason for the emergence and prevalence of drug resistant HIV strains. The prevalence of drug resistant HIV strains was increased with the continuation of antiretroviral therapy in the southern part of Henan province. Measures, that could promote high level adherence, provide new drugs and change ART regimens in failing patients, should be implemented as soon as possible."
14699,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Public health field services for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have not adequately evolved to address the expanding scale of the STI problem, its concentration among men who have sex with men, the emergence of new communication technologies and the availability of antiretroviral therapy as a cornerstone of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention. Field services need to modernize. Modernization should seek to expand field services objectives beyond sex partner STI testing and treatment to include: HIV testing of persons with bacterial STI and their partners, including efforts to promote frequent HIV/STI testing; increased condom access; linkage and relinkage to HIV care and promotion of viral suppression; preexposure prophylaxis promotion; linkage to long-acting contraception; and referral for health insurance. Field services programs cannot advance these new objectives while simultaneously doing all of the work they have traditionally done. Modernization will require a willingness to reconsider some longstanding aspects of field services work, including the centrality of face-to-face interviews and field investigations. Health departments seeking to modernize will need to carefully assess their ongoing activities and reorganize to align the use of field services resources with program priorities. In some instances, this may require reorganization to allow the staff greater specialization and closer integration with surveillance activities. Adapting programs will require new staff training, improvements in data management systems, and a greater investment in monitoring and evaluation. Although modernization is likely to evolve over many years, the time to start is now."
7833,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Before widespread antiretroviral therapy (ART), an estimated 17% of people delayed HIV care. We report national estimates of the prevalence and factors associated with delayed care entry in the contemporary ART era. We used Medical Monitoring Project data collected from June 2009 through May 2011 for 1425 persons diagnosed with HIV from May 2004 to April 2009 who initiated care within 12 months. We defined delayed care as entry >three months from diagnosis. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) were calculated to identify risk factors associated with delayed care. In this nationally representative sample of HIV-infected adults receiving medical care, 7.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.3-8.8) delayed care after diagnosis. Black race was associated with a lower likelihood of delay than white race (aPR 0.38). Men who have sex with women versus women who have sex with men (aPR 1.86) and persons required to take an HIV test versus recommended by a provider (aPR 2.52) were more likely to delay. Among those who delayed 48% reported a personal factor as the primary reason. Among persons initially diagnosed with HIV (non-AIDS), those who delayed care were twice as likely (aPR 2.08) to develop AIDS as of May 2011. Compared to the pre-ART era, there was a nearly 60% reduction in delayed care entry. Although relatively few HIV patients delayed care entry, certain groups may have an increased risk. Focus on linkage to care among persons who are required to take an HIV test may further reduce delayed care entry. "

The aim of this study was to evaluate overall antiviral efficacy and to compare the efficacy of combination therapy with adefovir (ADV) plus nucleoside analogues (lamivudine [LAM], telbivudine [LdT], or ETV) in patients infected with LAM- and ETV-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants. Virologic, biochemical, and serologic responses during combination therapy with ADV plus nucleoside analogues were assessed. Propensity score analysis was used to select a matched group of patients for the comparison of rescue therapy regimens. A total of 67 consecutive patients were analyzed. Complete virologic suppression was achieved in 27 patients. The overall cumulative incidence of complete virologic suppression at month 24 was 47.4%: 44.3% in the LAM or LdT plus ADV group and 51.4% in the group given ETV and ADV. There was no significant difference between these two groups (P = 0.234). The cumulative incidences of complete virologic suppression were still comparable between the two groups selected and matched using the propensity score model (P = 0.419). Virologic breakthrough was observed in 9 patients, and rtA181V substitution was newly detected in one patient. Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) negativity and lower baseline HBV DNA level were associated with complete virologic suppression in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, lower baseline HBV DNA level remained an independent predictor. In conclusion, combination therapy with ADV plus nucleoside analogues fails to show sufficient antiviral efficacy in CHB patients with resistance to both LAM and ETV. Further study is warranted to evaluate the efficacy of a more potent tenofovir-based regimen in such patients. "

Each patient who came for services at the sites in a 2-3 week sampling period was asked to complete a brief, self-administered questionnaire. We compared migrant with non-migrant patients to disclose characteristics predictive of migration and help plan for continuity of HIV care, future funding, and HIV prevention. Overall, 25% (range by site, 20%-38%) of the 1,286 patients in the study migrated to the counties from a non-contiguous Florida county, another state, or another country. In a multivariate model comparing interstate migrants with non-migrants, white and Hispanic race/ethnicity, age 9-29 years at first HIV diagnosis compared with older age, increasing education, highest current income and exposure category (men having sex with men and injection drug users) were independently associated with migration (all p < 0.05). In a similar model for international migrants, the independently associated variables included Hispanic ethnicity, education, and younger age at first HIV diagnosis. Although migrating can bring benefits to a patient such as improved access to health care or a new employment opportunity, it is stressful because it can result in changes in a person's social network, employment, and health care providers. Thus, moving could create unique patient needs concerning medication adherence, risk-taking, and other psychosocial needs. Given the high percentage of migrants in these urban Florida county clinics, these needs should be further examined and addressed."

Many studies have been undertaken on factors affecting adherence to ART; however, there is little information about Laos. Hence, this qualitative study examines barriers to and facilitators of adherence specific to this context. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were undertaken with 43 people living with HIV (PLHIV) currently on ART across 2 hospitals in Laos: Setthathirath hospital in the capital Vientiane and Savannakhet Province hospital. Interviews were based on semistructured question guides and were undertaken in Lao, translated into English and audio-recorded for later analysis. Major barriers to adherence reported by participants included transport costs, distance to the hospital, and stigma and discrimination. Key facilitators discussed were the perceived benefits of medication, social support, and the acceptance of HIV status. "

This paper evaluates the use of AZT and other antiretroviral agents, as well as access to, and utilization of, medical and social services among intravenous drug users (IDUs) in Miami, Florida. An ongoing prospective study of street-recruited IDUs in Miami-Dade County identified 20 HIV-infected IDUs who had HIV disease (CDC classification IV), and took antiretroviral and other medications after intervention. Participants included 13 active and 7 inactive IDUs. Longitudinal data and in-depth interviews made possible detailed studies of participants during periods when they were taking antiretroviral medications. Those IDUs who are HIV-positive have also received intensive medical and social services. Participants in the study reported nausea, malaise, insomnia, and dysphoria upon initiating AZT therapy. Eleven readily attributed these symptoms to use of antiretroviral medications, primarily AZT. Nevertheless, 9 reported an overall positive impression of the drug's effects; seven despite initial negative reactions to the medication. These results, plus measurement of medication in the blood, indicate that the IDUs studied not only took the antiviral(s), but often were willing to do so in spite of this medication making them feel bad."

There has been relatively little attention paid to people aging with HIV. This study reports on a group of Australian PLWHA aged 50 years and over. They are compared to younger PLWHA on a range of social dimensions. Older PLWHA were significantly less likely to rate their health and well-being as good or excellent. A significantly larger percentage of older PLWHA reported additional health conditions (47.2% versus 35.5%), of which the most common was cardiovascular disease (12.2% of older PLWHA). There was no significant difference in the percentage of older PLWHA who reported a mental health condition. Younger PLWHA were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with hepatitis C (15.3% versus 8.1% for older PLWHA). Older PLWHA were markedly less likely to be in contact with services, both those that were HIV related and those that were not. The financial circumstances of older PLWHA were significantly worse than for younger PLWHA, and personal support through a regular sexual relationship was also significantly less. The clinical and community needs of this group of PLWHA are likely to be of increasing concern. The challenges associated with this group will be the consequence both of the effects of long-term therapy, with potentially toxic side effects, and the natural aging process."

Little is known about Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) outcomes in patients living with AIDS. We conducted a cohort study to investigate long-term survival among CHM-treated AIDS patients. Patients were poor farmers who contracted HIV-1 infection when selling blood in the 1990s. Symptoms of AIDS included recurring respiratory tract infections with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, swollen lymph nodes and weight loss. 385 patients with AIDS were included and 165 of them used a 16-herb formula for 14 days to 9 months. The eight-year survival rate was 87% for the CHM users and 34% for the non-users (increased survival probability for CHM user, 9.6; 95% CI = 6.0-15.4; p < 0.0001). Survival probability further increased 14.6-fold (95% CI = 8.2-26.1), when excluding the users who received CHM for less than three months. Zero deaths were found in patients who used CHM for six to nine months. All the survivors regained their body weight and none of them experienced a relapse of AIDS or any severe adverse events. After the CHM treatment for an average of 3.6 months, the plasma HIV load was 74.7% lower (paired t-test, p = 0.151) and the number of blood CD4+ lymphocytes increased from 253 to 314 (paired t-test, p = 0.021).

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in humans, has been considered one of the most important host factors with respect to outcomes. To date, conventional genotyping studies have shown that HLA class II loci are mainly associated with spontaneous clearance of HBV and HCV. However, the specific HLA locus associated with the outcomes of hepatitis virus infection remains unclear. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a comprehensive approach for human genotyping demonstrated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the outcomes of hepatitis virus infection. Examination of large numbers of cohorts revealed that several SNPs in both HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 loci are associated with persistent HBV infection in Asian populations. To date, however, few studies have focused on HLA-DP because polymorphisms of HLA-DP haplotype do not vary greatly as compared with other loci of HLA. There are not enough studies to reveal the function of HLA-DP. GWAS additionally detected candidate SNPs within HLA loci associated with chronic HBV or HCV hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The results of one cohort were not always consistent with those of other cohorts. To solve several controversial issues, it is necessary to validate reported SNPs on HLA loci in global populations and to elucidate the HLA-allele-regulated molecular response to hepatitis virus infection.

Twenty-two (n = 22) patients with CD4 lymphocyte counts over 200 cells microL(-1) were treated with 180 microg of PEG-IFN alpha-2a subcutaneously once in a week for 48 weeks. HCV load (HCV RNA), HIV load (HIV RNA) and CD4 lymphocyte counts were measured at baseline and 4, 12, 24, 48 and 72 weeks after initiation of anti-HCV therapy. Efficacy and safety were analysed according to baseline CD4 status (> or =350 cells microL(-1)). Significant HCV-RNA decreases (>1 log(10) copies mL(-1)) were observed through week 72 after PEG-INF alpha-2a monotherapy across both CD4 strata. CD4 status was not associated with treatment outcomes as evaluated using rapid viral response rate (P = 0.655), early viral response rate (P = 0.387), end-of-treatment viral response rate (P = 1.000) or sustained viral response rate (SVR, P = 0.674). A sustained virological response was achieved in nine patients (41%), five with genotype 2a (83%) and four with genotype 1b (25%, P = 0.023). SVR was HCV genotype dependent. Eleven patients required a dose reduction in PEG-IFN alpha-2a. PEG-IFN alpha-2a monotherapy could be considered as a safe and effective option for the treatment of HCV infection in HIV patients with haemophilia, particularly in resource-limited settings. While higher CD4 lymphocyte counts resulted in greater HCV-RNA reduction, HCV genotype was a predictor for sustained virological response."

A Heckman 2-stage approach (generalized estimating equations probit model) was used to compare visits with moderate or poor adherence and visits with high adherence. Between months 12 and 60, at least 1 self-reported adherence measure was available for 970 of the 1110 patients with at least 12 months of follow-up (3889 visits with adherence assessments). Adherence was rated as high at 2466 visits, moderate at 1125, and poor at 298. After adjustment for ""missingness,"" moderate and poor adherence were independently associated with age (younger), perceived treatment side effects, dosing frequency different from twice daily, and a protease inhibitor-based regimen. They were also associated with depression and lack of support from the main partner. High adherence was most likely among patients born outside the European Union. A comparison restricted to poor-adherence and high-adherence visits yielded a similar pattern of predictors. Adjusting for missing outcome data changed the predictor set. Reasons for nonadherence are multifactorial. Psychosocial interventions and the selection of the best-tolerated regimens are needed to improve long-term adherence of HIV-infected patients to their lifelong treatment."

The annual prevalence of HCV genotypes/subtypes and their influence on HCV clearance with antiviral treatment were examined in a dynamic cohort of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients followed up in Madrid since 2000. Patients entered the cohort at first visit and left the cohort when HCV clearance was achieved with HCV therapy or when follow-up was interrupted for any reason, including death. A total of 672 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients constituted the cohort. The mean follow-up time was 5.5 years, corresponding to 4108 patient-years. Mean age at entry was 37 years, and 73% were men and 86% were intravenous drug users. Overall distribution of HCV genotypes was as follows: 57.1% HCV-1 (1a: 29.2%, 1b: 20.4%, unknown: 7.6%), 1.3% HCV-2, 25.4% HCV-3 and 15.9% HCV-4. A total of 274 (40.8%) patients were treated with peginterferon-ribavirin, of whom 116 (42.3%) achieved HCV clearance following 1-3 courses of therapy. The proportion of HCV-1/4 rose from 71.7% in 2000 to 76.8% in 2008, whereas the proportion of HCV-2/3 fell from 28.1% in 2000 to 23.2% in 2008. The yearly prevalence increased for HCV-1 (R(2) : 0.92, b: 0.59, P < 0.001) and HCV-4 (R(2) : 0.77, b: 0.33, P < 0.005) and conversely diminished for HCV-3 (R(2) : 0.94, b: -0.82, P < 0.001). In summary, the prevalence of HCV-1 and HCV-4 has increased over the last decade in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, whereas conversely it has declined for HCV-3, in association with the wider use of HCV therapy (41%) in this population."

This population-based cohort study aimed to investigate whether antiviral therapy for HCV infection was associated with improved clinical outcomes related to diabetes. From the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 2,267,270 Taiwanese residents diagnosed with diabetes mellitus were screened for eligibility. HCV infection was defined by a specific diagnosis code and measurement of serum antibody. After excluding patients with serious comorbidity, we enrolled a total of 1,411 eligible patients who received pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (treated cohort), and matched them 1:1 with 1,411 untreated controls by propensity scores (untreated cohort). We also matched the treated cohort 1:4 with 5,644 diabetic patients without HCV infection (uninfected cohort). Participants were followed up for the occurrence of endstage renal disease (ESRD), ischemic stroke, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) after receiving antiviral treatment or the corresponding calendar date. From 2003 to 2011, the 8-year cumulative incidences of ESRD in the treated, untreated, and uninfected cohorts were 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-2.0%), 9.3% (95% CI, 5.9-12.7%), and 3.3% (95% CI, 2.3-4.3%), respectively (P < 0.001); those of stroke were 3.1% (95% CI, 1.1-5.0%), 5.3% (95% CI, 3.0-7.5%), and 6.1% (95% CI, 4.8-7.4%), respectively (P = 0.01); and those for ACS were 4.1% (95% CI, 2.1-6.1%), 6.6% (95% CI, 3.7-9.5%), and 7.4% (95% CI, 5.9-9.0%), respectively (P = 0.05).

A survey was administered to 72 patients in three different stages of HIV/AIDS (CDC clinical categories A, B, C). Multivariate analyses revealed that there were no significant differences in patients' perceptions of the severity of HIV/AIDS or perceptions of the benefits and barriers for the treatment across three disease stages. However, the most severely ill patients (in stage C) perceived a higher risk of complications if they did not take their medicine as prescribed compared to asymptomatic patients (stage A) (p = 0.01). Also, patients in stages B and C were more adherent to their medications compared to patients in stage A (p = 0.007). Finally, perceived susceptibility-inaction was positively related to medication adherence (p = 0.005) and difficulty in following doctors' instructions was negatively related to patients' medication adherence (p = 0.009). In conclusion, patients' illness experiences are associated with their beliefs about the chances of developing complications if they do not adhere to their medications. Patients who have experienced more complications perceive a stronger relationship between medication non-adherence and AIDS-related complications, and are also more adherent to their medication regimen when compared to patients with no prior complications."

The simplicity of once daily dosing, few metabolic side effects and efficacy against hepatitis B virus make TDF suitable for use in a large scale program. Unlike thymidine analoge nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs); tenofovir does not induce multi-NRTI resistance mutations, so more NRTI options are available for future second-line-regimens. Fixed-dose combinations of TDF with other ARVs as a single tablet regimen are now widely available for adults and adolescents, but none are available for young children. Current information on TDF including the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability in children and adolescents was reviewed. A dosing regimen according to body-weight-band has been established for pediatric use. Safety concerns of TDF mainly relate to its effects on renal function and bone mineral density. Regular monitoring of renal function in high-risk patients, including those on other nephrotoxic drugs, may be warranted to detect adverse renal effects. Long-term-data on renal and bone outcomes among HIV-infected children is needed. Lessons learned from clinical studies will help clinicians balance the risks and benefits of TDF and design appropriate antiretroviral regimens for children in different circumstances."

Clinical data concerning consecutive HIV patients treated for DLBCL located in head and neck region with CHT and RT were retrospectively reviewed. Systemic treatment consisted of combination CHT agents given with concomitant HAART and regimen was left to oncologists' discretion. Involved field RT was delivered at a total dose of 30-36 Gy (2 Gy per fraction). Survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was evaluated using National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Overall, 13 patients were included. There were no missing data. Eight patients had advanced disease (stage III-IV = 8; 61.5%). The most common primary tumor location was oral cavity (n = 7) with large mass at presentation. All patients completed the programmed treatment. Severe acute toxicity was observed in one patient, only. Overall, three patients had died and no treatment-related deaths occurred. After a median follow-up of 152 months, the 20-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 65.9 and 41.5%, respectively. Globally, there were no RT-related late complications. This data analysis suggested that CHT followed by RT can be safety proposed in the management of patients with HIV-related HN-DLBCL in the HAART era.

The clinical relevance of this phenomenon in HIV-1 patients starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is unknown. We followed 93 therapy naive HIV-1-infected adults who were anti-HBc positive, HBsAg and HBeAg negative, during first year of HAART. At baseline, HBV-DNA was quantified, and HBV genotype was determined in the HBV-DNA-positive patients by sequencing a part of the HBV genome. Four of 93 patients (4%) were HBV DNA positive at baseline. All four patients tested negative for HBV-DNA after 1 year. They all received lamivudine as part of their HAART. They had no clinically significant liver enzyme elevations (LEE) during the first year of HAART. Two of the patients had a genotype A, one genotype E, and in the fourth patient sequencing was not possible. In one patient we found significant mutations in the a determinant region of HBsAg, at positions 142 and 144. In our population of therapy-naive HIV-1-infected adults who were anti-HBc positive, we found occult HBV infection in 4% of the patients. We did not find an increased risk for LEE in our population of patients after the start of HAART. Our results illustrate that occult HBV infection is more a diagnostic than a clinical problem. It may be caused by very low levels of HBV replication, concurrent presence of HBsAg and anti-HBs, or mutations in the HBsAg a determinant."

Overall, cimetidine-treated patients had a decline in CD4+ cell counts that was no different from the decline for placebo-treated persons, neither during the first 8 weeks of the trial (mean drop, 7.1% [standard error, 12.1-1.8] vs. 6.7% [standard error, 11.6-1.5]) nor during the subsequent 8 weeks of open-label administration of cimetidine. No differences were evident between the treatment groups in terms of the percentage reactive to p24 antigen at baseline, and p24 antigen concentrations did not change from baseline to the end of week 8.

Three groups of macaques were inoculated with 50 50% median infective doses of pathogenic SHIV 89.P, which expresses env of dual-tropic HIV type 1 (HIV-1) 89.6 primary isolate.

At the same time, a dramatic decrease (greater than 77%) of bone marrow CD34(+) long-term culture-initiating cells was noted in all animals were found. No statistically significant differences between placebo- and HAART-treated monkeys were found.

One such function, antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP), is thought to be involved in controlling other viral infections, but its role in HIV infection is unknown. We measured the ability of HIV-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to mediate the internalization of HIV-1 virions and HIV-1-decorated cells by phagocytes. To measure ADP of virions, we primarily used a green-fluorescent protein-expressing molecular clone of HIV-1JRFL, an R5, clinical isolate, in combination with polyclonal HIVIG or mAbs known to capture and/or neutralize HIV-1. THP-1 and U937 cells, as well as freshly isolated primary monocytes from healthy individuals, were used as phagocytic effector cells, and uptake of virions was measured by cytometry. We surprisingly found minimal or no ADP of virions with any of the antibodies. However, after coating virions with gp41 or with gp41-derived peptides, gp41- (but not gp120-) specific mAbs efficiently mediated phagocytosis. We estimated that a minimum of a few hundred gp41 molecules were needed for successful phagocytosis, which is similar to the number of envelope spikes on viruses that are readily phagocytosed (e.g. influenza virus). Furthermore, by employing fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, a well-established technique to measure particle sizes and aggregation phenomena, we found a clear association between virus aggregation and ADP. In contrast to virions themselves, virion-decorated cells were targets for ADP or trogocytosis in the presence of HIV-specific antibodies. Our findings indicate that ADP of virions may not play a role in preventing HIV infection, likely due to the paucity of trimers and the consequent inability of virion-bound antibody to cross-link FcyRs on phagocytes. However, ADP or trogocytosis could play a role in clearing HIV-infected cells and cells on the verge of infection."

However, reactivation of remaining latently infected memory CD4+ T cells is a source of continued virus production, forcing patients to remain on HAART despite clinically undetectable viral loads. Unfortunately, the latent reservoir decays slowly, with a half-life of up to 44 months, making it the major known obstacle to the eradication of HIV-1 infection. However, the mechanism underlying the long half-life of the latent reservoir is unknown.

Although most of the cardiac manifestations associated with HIV-infection exhibit a slow progression, rapid courses may lead to fatal complications. Early screening of HIV-infected patients will identify the potentially fatal complications of HIV disease and permit efficient treatment. The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) significantly reduced the mortality and morbidity of HIV-infected patients. However, the impact that HAART will have on the incidence and prevalence of cardiac complications in HIV-infected patients is still unknown.

Combination therapy, comprising at least three classes of drugs, has become the standard of care for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or HIV-infected individuals. The drug cocktail can comprise all three classes of HIV inhibitors, including nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI). Due to their competitive mode of inhibition and requirement for metabolic activation, almost all NRTI drugs lack the virological potency of NNRTI or PI drugs. However, data from clinical trials indicate that sustained viral suppression could not be achieved with NRTI, NNRTI or PIs alone. Therefore, the NRTIs will remain essential components of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for the foreseeable future, because they enhance the virological potency of the regimen, they do not bind excessively to protein and most regimens are small pills/tablets given once a day. It has become apparent in recent years that the prolonged use of certain NRTIs exhibits adverse events as a class, limiting the length of time for which they can be safely used. Of major clinical concern is their association with the potentially fatal lactic acidaemia and hepatic steatosis. These class events, as well as individual drug effects, such as peripheral neuropathy, are linked to delayed mitochondrial destruction. In addition to toxicity, the development of resistance-conferring mutations against exposure to nucleoside analogs currently in use influences long-term therapeutic benefits. Of critical importance for the evaluation of new NRTIs are recent studies showing that the efficiency of discrimination or excision by pyrophosphorolysis in the presence of nucleotides of a given NRTI is a key determinant in the emergence of one or the other resistance pathway."

Despite the fact that the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) led to significant improve quality of life and decrease morbidity including mortality-associated to HIV/AIDS, adverse drug effects lead to interruptions in both HIV and TB therapy. In addition, an important problem when HAART is initiated in patients with TB is the possibility of developing immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). A six-month regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutal for two months followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for four months is a standard regimen for the treatment of known or presumed drug-susceptible TB disease. The following strategy may minimize the risk of IRIS. Patients with CD4 cell counts < 100 cells/mm3, efavirenz-based HAART regimen is recommended and should be initiated as soon as the patients can tolerate TB treatment. Patients with CD4 cell counts 100-350 cells/mm3, HAART should be started at two months after TB treatment initiation. HAART should be deferred with closed follow-up of CD4 cell counts if patients have CD4 cell counts > 350 cells/mm3."

Influences of DNA load and DNA reverse-transcriptase (RT) mutations on virological responses were assessed at month 6 after initiation of therapy. Baseline heterogeneity was observed: peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) genotyping showed 31% RT mutations with 1-5 NRTI-related mutations, 78% protease mutations had 1-5 PI-related mutations; and HIV-1-DNA levels were 1.8-3.5 log(10) copies/10(6) PBMC. Outcomes for 49 patients on a regimen of 2 NRTIs plus ABC were as follows: 22 successes, 10 blips (""blip"" defined as intermittent plasma HIV-1 RNA levels between 50 and 100 copies/mL and a return to an undetectable level), and 17 failures, whereas, for patients continuing on a regimen of 2 NRTIs plus 1 PI, there were 19 successes and 1 blip.

HBV postexposure prophylaxis includes starting hepatitis B vaccine series in any susceptible unvaccinated operating room personnel who sustain an exposure to blood or body fluid during surgery. Postexposure prophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is an important consideration after determining the hepatitis B antigen status of the patient. Ideally, all operating room personnel should be vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine before they pursue their career in surgery. Immune globulin and antiviral agents (e.g., interferon with or without ribavirin) should not be used for postexposure prophylaxis of operating room personnel exposed to patients with HCV; rather, follow-up HCV testing should be initiated to determine if infection develops. Postexposure prophylaxis for HIV involves a basic four-week regimen of two drugs (zidovudine and lamivudine; lamivudine and stavudine; or didanosine and stavudine) for most exposures. An expanded regimen that includes a third drug must be considered for HIV exposures that pose an increased risk for transmission. When developing a postexposure prophylaxis regimen, it is helpful to contact the National Clinicians' Postexposure Prophylaxis Hotline (1-888-448-4911)."

Conversely, missed visits after diagnosis are associated with increased mortality in the public care setting. We analyzed mortality among newly diagnosed HIV patients ≥18 years old in a large private care setting between 01/01/1997 and 12/31/2009, comparing patients who missed visits in their first year following diagnosis (index period) with those who did not. Patients who died during the index period were excluded. Hazard ratios (HR) for association of missed visits and mortality were obtained by Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for patient demographics, CD4+ counts, and AIDS-defining conditions (CDC, 1993) at diagnosis. We also evaluated risk factors of missed visits by multivariable logistic regression. 2811 patients were included, of whom 65% had ≥1 missed visit, and 226 patients died during follow-up. Patients with ≥1 missed visit had a 71% increased mortality risk (HR=1.71, p=0.001) with 12% increased rate per missed visit (HR=1.12, p<0.001). Factors associated with missed visits were younger age (OR=1.69 compared to 60+ years), Black and Latino race/ethnicity (OR=1.54, 1.48 respectively, compared to Caucasians), injection drug use (OR=2.50 compared to men who have sex with men), and lower CD4+ (OR=1.43 for CD4+ 100-199 cells/μL, OR=1.39 for 50-99 cells/μL, and OR=1.63 for CD4+ <50 cells/μL, compared with CD4+ >500 cells/μL). In an insured patient population, missed visits in the first year of HIV care are common and associated with increased mortality. Early retention in HIV care is critical to improving outcomes."

We sought to identify a pooled response rate and sources of interstudy variability. A literature search was conducted to identify randomized or prospective studies evaluating response rates to peg-IFN + RIB in coinfected patients. A Bayesian hierarchical model was used to estimate overall response rate. Between-study variance was calculated and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Meta-regression was employed to identify sources of between-study variability. The literature search yielded seven studies of 146, which matched keywords and inclusion criteria. The combined patient total was 784. Individual intention-to-treat response rates ranged from 27.3% to 44.2%. The pooled Bayesian estimate of percent response was 33.3%. Significant interstudy heterogeneity was detected. Meta-regression yielded no significant effects of covariates on response rate. Subanalyses by CD4+, HCV viral load and genotype yielded sustained virological response (SVR) odds ratios of 0.73 for low CD4+, 0.41 for high viral load and 0.30 for genotype 1/4. The pooled response rate is not attributable to any one study. Response is poor compared with HCV-monoinfected patients. Interstudy variability is not satisfactorily explained by factors influencing individual response, but may be due to differences between studies unavailable for inclusion in this analysis. However, both genotype 1/4 and high HCV viral load at baseline were significantly associated with a reduction in odds of SVR in pooled subanalysis. Improved treatments are needed in coinfected patients, especially with genotype 1/4 and high viral load."

Extensive biological analysis revealed that some of these individuals do well, at least in part, because they possess weakened or attenuated viruses. Also, previously, to determine the genotype associated with the attenuated phenotype in vivo, we characterized nef, vif, vpr, vpu, env, and LTR in our cohort of LTS. In this study, we analyzed gag and pol genes derived from eight individuals in our cohort. For each subject multiple full-length gag and pol clones were obtained for analysis. In most cases, the sequences derived from the LTS had an intact open reading frame. At the protein level, there were no discernible differences between the sequences derived from LTS and those derived from patients with AIDS. Thus, no common defect in gag and pol was found in our cohort. One individual (subject SF), however, had only Gag-defective proviral sequences (10 of 10) in his peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, longitudinal studies of the samples collected from SF over a 2-year period showed that all p17 gag clones sequenced (24 of 24) were defective due to G-to-A hypermutations. This viral defect in Gag may provide the molecular basis for this individual's extremely low viral load and long-term asymptomatic state. These results, together with previous findings in our LTS cohort, reinforce the notion that it is unlikely that a single common viral genetic determinant accounts for the lack of disease progression in all cases. Multiple host and viral factors undoubtedly contribute to the well-being of LTS of HIV-1 infection."

The role of human papilloma viruses (HPV 16 and 18), hepatitis B virus (HBV), Epstein-Barr herpes virus (EBV), and retroviruses (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus [HTLV]) in the development of common carcinomas and lymphomas represents a major cancer threat, particularly among individuals residing in developing countries, which account for 80% of the world's population. Even though these viruses are not the sole etiological agents of these cancers (as would be the case for infectious diseases), different approaches can be implemented to significantly decrease the incidence of virus-associated malignancies. The first approach is vaccination, which is available for HBV and possibly soon for EBV. The long delay between primary viral infection and development of associated tumors as well as the cost involved with administering vaccinations detracts from the feasibility of such an approach within developing countries. The second approach is to increase efforts to detect pre-cancerous lesions or early tumors using immunovirological means. This would allow early diagnosis and better treatment. The third strategy is linked to the existence of disease susceptibility genes, and suggests that counseling be provided for individuals carrying these genes to encourage them to modify their lifestyles and other conditions associated with increased cancer risks (predictive oncology). Specific recommendations include: a) increase international studies that explore the causes of the large variations in prevalence of common cancers throughout the world; b) conduct interdisciplinary studies involving laboratory investigation and social sciences, which may suggest hypotheses that may then be tested experimentally; and c) promote more preventive and health enhancement strategies in addition to curative and replacement therapies."

We previously showed that umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSC) can be differentiated towards hepatocyte-like cells in vitro. In this study we infected undifferentiated (UD-) and differentiated (D-) UCMSCs with HBV and studied the infection kinetics, comparing them to primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). UD-UCMSCs, although permissive to viral binding, had a very limited uptake capacity, whereas D-UCMSCs showed binding and uptake capabilities similar to PHHs. Likewise, asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) was up-regulated in UCMSCs upon differentiation. In D-UCMSCs, a dose-dependent inhibition of HBV binding and uptake was observed when ASGPR was saturated with known specific ligands. Subsequent viral replication was shown in D-UCMSCs but not in UD-UCMSCs. Susceptibility of UCMSCs to viral replication correlated with the degree of differentiation. Replication efficiency was low compared to PHHs, but was confirmed by (1) a dose-dependent inhibition by specific antiviral treatment using tenofovir; (2) the increase of viral RNAs along time; (3) de novo synthesis of viral proteins; and (4) secretion of infectious viral progeny."

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been identified as a major causative agent of post-transfusion hepatitis. The host immune response to HCV infection is composed of both non- specific immune response, including interferon (IFN) production and natural killer (NK) cell activity and a virus-specific immune response, including humoral and cellular components. Susceptibility to infection has been related to immunological disturbances. Several studies have provided experimental evidence of disorders of both cellular and humoral immunity. Humoral Immunity is dependent mainly on immunoglobulins and little data are available about serum immunoglobulin values in chronic hepatitis C. The present study aimed to evaluate humoral immune response by measuring the concentration of serum immunoglobulin isotypes (IgG, IgM, IgA) and IgG-subclasses level (IgG1-4) in chronic hepatitis C patients and healthy controls. This study included 50 patients with chronic hepatitis C. All of them had positive serum anti-HCV antibodies, positive serum HCV-RNA by PCR, and histologically-proven chronic hepatitis. The results were compared with 25 healthy controls. Total IgG, IgA and IgM were assayed by nephelometry. IgG subclasses were assayed using human IgG subclasses enzyme immunoassay. Serum protein electrophoresis was performed in agarose gel. The results showed that no significant difference in serum immunoglobulin levels were found among patients with chronic hepatitis C of minimal liver damage( Knodell index < or =3) and patients with mild liver disease (Knodell index > 3). A significant increase in total serum IgG, IgG1 and IgG2 levels were found in patients with chronic hepatitis than in healthy controls but no difference was found in IgG3 and IgG4 in both patients and controls. Mean serum IgM was increased in patients with HCV infection compared with healthy controls. No significant difference was found in IgA level in both the patients and healthy controls. Our data revealed an increase of humoral immune response in chronic hepatitis C infection. This is evidenced by an elevation in serum immunoglobulin isotypes; IgG and its subclasses IgG1 and IgG2 and IgM. These findings may provide some new insights into the antibody response to HCV."

We identified patients with active HCV infection, confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a known HCV genotype, from the VA HCV Clinical Case Registry between 2000 and 2009. We examined the effect of HCV genotype on the risk of cirrhosis and HCC in a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for patients' age, period of service (World War I/II, Vietnam era, post-Vietnam era), race, gender, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, alcohol use, diabetes, body mass index, and antiviral treatment receipt.

To identify factors associated with delayed presentation to medical care after testing HIV-positive or with late HIV testing, we studied 968 patients at their first HIV care visit, enrolled in a multicenter study in Italy from 1997-2000. Patients completed a questionnaire on HIV-testing history, sexual behavior, and drug use behavior. Delayed presenters were patients with >6 months between their first HIV-positive test and presentation for HIV care; late testers were patients with CD4 count < 200 /mm or clinically defined AIDS at their first HIV-positive test. Among the study patients, 255 (26.3%) were delayed presenters, and 280 (28.9%) were late testers. In multinomial logistic regression analysis, injection drug use significantly increased (odds ratio [OR]= 5.04) the probability of delayed presentation but reduced (OR = 0.55) the chance of late testing. A previous HIV-negative test was associated with a reduced risk of both delayed presentation (OR = 0.39) and late testing (OR = 0.36). Unemployment was positively associated with delayed presentation and increasing age with late testing, whereas HIV counseling at the time of first positive HIV test strongly (OR = 0.42) reduced the odds of delayed presentation. Interventions aimed at promoting timely access to care of HIV-infected persons should consider differentiated programs for delayed presentation and late testing."

High adherence was maintained among SMR users (change = -0.11 %) but declined among non-users (change = -2.05 %; p = 0.003). Among SMR users, there was a steady improvement in adherence as monthly frequency of SMR use increased (p = 0.009).

The study disclosed that 26 of 132 patients with AIDS (20%) had cytomegalovirus retinitis. However, subset analysis according to CD4+ count disclosed that in patients with CD4+ counts of 50 cells/mm3 or less, 26 of 87 (30%) had cytomegalovirus retinitis, whereas in patients with CD4+ counts of 50 cells/mm3 or more, none of 45 was noted to have cytomegalovirus retinitis. Similarly, 46 of 132 patients (35%) were noted to have HIV-related noninfectious retinal vasculopathy, with a trend toward increasing prevalence associated with declining CD4+ count. In patients with CD4+ counts of 50 cells/mm3 or less, 39 of 87 (45%) had HIV-related noninfectious retinal vasculopathy, whereas seven of 45 patients (16%) with CD4+ counts of 50 cells/mm3 or more were noted to have these changes. We confirmed the clinical impression that cytomegalovirus retinitis and HIV-related noninfectious retinal vasculopathy are late manifestations of AIDS, demonstrated an increased risk for patients with low CD4+ counts, and suggested a basis for coherent chemoprophylaxis and screening strategies for cytomegalovirus retinitis."

However, a large proportion of patients are still being diagnosed in late stages. Our objective was to evaluate the temporal trend in the CD4+ cell count at diagnosis during a 13 year period and the factors associated with late HIV diagnosis in asymptomatic individuals tested in the Centre for Prevention, Counselling and Diagnosis of our hospital. It was a retrospective study including all asymptomatic patients with new diagnosis of HIV infection. Very late presenters (VLP) were defined as those with CD4+ counts < 200 and late presenters (LP) with CD4+ < 350 cell/mm3. We also evaluated the proportion of patients diagnosed with CD4+ cell counts below 500 cell/mm3. Between January 2002 and December 2014, 20 263 patients were tested for HIV, 1104 with a positive result of whom 995 asymptomatic individuals were included. Overall, median CD4+ count was 372 cells/mm3 and HIV-RNA 31 145 copies/ml. There was no evidence that the CD4+ count at diagnosis progressively increased over time, nor that the proportion of VLP and LP decreased. In a multivariate model older age, heterosexual transmission and intravenous drug use remained as independent factors associated with LP. In conclusion, late diagnosis of HIV infection remains prevalent among asymptomatic patients, highlighting the need to continue implementing strategies towards early diagnosis."

Twenty-four subjects with advanced HIV-1 infection (CD4(+) T-cell count, <100/microl) and stable viral loads were studied using blood plasma samples collected over a study period of approximately 9 months, during which time most of the subjects were treated with reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The V3-HTA patterns from the first and last time points were evaluated initially to determine the amounts of change in V3 sequence populations, which were primarily changes in abundance in preexisting sequence populations. Three of the 24 subjects had major changes (greater than 50% total change in the relative abundance of the sequence populations), 11 subjects had intermediate changes (10 to 50% total change), and 10 subjects had minimal changes (less than 10% total change). The average total amount of change was between two- and threefold greater in subjects with X4-like variants, although there was no correlation between average viral load and the presence of X4-like variants. V3-HTA patterns in monthly samples from 11 of the subjects were also compared. In two subjects, the amount of change exceeded 40% in a 1-month period. Overall, the pace of change in V3 populations varied between subjects and was not constant within a subject over time. Sequence analysis of the V3 variants showed that R5-like variants (not containing any X4-associated substitutions) continued to be maintained in three subjects in the presence of X4-like variants, indicating that X4 variants do not always outgrow R5 variants. The coreceptor usage of the V3 sequences from two subjects was determined using a cell fusion assay. One subject had an X4 variant that was maintained at a low level for at least 9 months, during which time the predominant variants were R5X4 (dualtropic), while in the second subject the reverse situation was observed. One of the dualtropic variants had a novel sequence motif in V3, suggesting another evolutionary pathway to altered tropism. These studies begin to probe the complexities and pace of V3 evolution in vivo, revealing dynamic patterns of change among multiple V3 sequence variants in a subset of subjects."

It is approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced adult patients who have evidence of viral replication and are harbouring HIV-1 strains resistant to other antiretroviral (ARV) agents. In the US, etravirine must be used in combination with other ARV agents; in the EU, it must be used in combination with other ARV agents that include a boosted HIV-1 protease inhibitor. Etravirine shows good activity in vitro against most wild-type strains of HIV-1, as well as against several strains resistant to available NNRTIs. Furthermore, etravirine appears to present a higher barrier than first-generation NNRTIs against the development of drug resistance. Whereas the presence of a single mutation is sufficient to affect the virological response to efavirenz or nevirapine, the resistance profile of etravirine is more complex and a prediction of virological response may be calculated using a weighted genotypic score. Importantly, the most prevalent NNRTI-associated mutation, K103N, alone does not affect the etravirine response. In two identically designed randomized clinical trials, the addition of etravirine to an optimized background therapy (OBT) regimen improved virological responses to a greater extent than placebo plus OBT following 24 weeks' treatment in highly treatment-experienced adult patients with HIV-1 infection who had evidence of viral replication (HIV-1 RNA levels of >5000 copies/mL at baseline). Furthermore, pre-planned pooled analyses of the trials at 48 and 96 weeks showed that etravirine plus OBT provided durable virological suppression. Consistently higher virological response rates were observed for recipients of etravirine plus OBT than placebo plus OBT in a pre-specified subgroup analysis of baseline viral loads, CD4+ cell counts, HIV-1 subtype or the composition of background ARV therapy. Greater improvements from baseline in immunological outcomes were also observed for recipients of etravirine plus OBT compared with those receiving placebo plus OBT over the 96-week treatment period of the trials. When used as part of an OBT regimen in trials of up to 96 weeks duration, etravirine was well tolerated with an overall tolerabilty profile similar to that of placebo. The only treatment-emergent adverse event that occurred with a higher frequency for recipients of etravirine compared with placebo plus OBT was rash. In highly treatment-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection and evidence of viral replication, the addition of etravirine to an OBT regimen provides an effective and well tolerated treatment that leads to improvements in both virological and immunological outcomes."

This cytopathic effect was preceded by the expression of HIV antigen, defined with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for the core protein (p24) of HIV. SKT-1B is highly susceptible to HIV as compared with MT-2 and H9 cells. HIV is known to be transmitted via blood products, and thus we examined whether or not currently used procedures for manufacturing blood products are safe by using SKT-1B. Lyophilized HIV was heated at 65 degrees for time periods in the range of 10 min to 48 hr, and the infectivity was examined. The results showed that heating at 65 degrees for less than 2 hr was not sufficient to inactivate HIV, but the virus heated for 48 hr had no effect on SKT-1B. In addition, HIV completely lost its infectivity on sulfonation, which is commonly used to avoid anaphylactic shock on intravenous infusion of human immunoglobulins. These findings indicate that blood products manufactured by currently used procedures are probably safe with respect to HIV infection."

We have examined the role of Fc gamma R in mediating antibody-dependent clearance of HIV-1 by human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages by using bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) to independently target the virus to Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII, or Fc gamma RIII. Virus production was markedly reduced in monocytes cultured with strain HIV-1IIIB opsonized with BsAbs that target the virus to either Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RII compared to monocytes cultured with virus in the absence of BsAbs or in the presence of BsAbs that target the virus to non-Fc gamma R surface antigens (CD33 and HLA-A,B,C). These results were confirmed using the monotropic isolate HIV-1JRFL. Interaction of HIV-1JRFL with Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RII on human monocytes and Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII, or Fc gamma RIII on monocyte-derived macrophages resulted in markedly reduced levels of virus production in these cultures. Moreover, HIV-1 infection of monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages was completely blocked by anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies, indicating that interaction with CD4 is required for infectivity even under conditions of antibody-mediated binding of HIV-1 to Fc gamma R. Thus, we propose that highly opsonized HIV-1 initiates high-affinity multivalent interactions with Fc gamma R that trigger endocytosis and intracellular degradation of the antibody-virus complex. At lower levels of antibody opsonization, there are two few interactions with Fc gamma R to initiate endocytosis and intracellular degradation of the antibody-virus complex, but there are enough interactions to stabilize the virus at the cell surface, allowing antibody-dependent enhancement of HIV-1 infection through high-affinity CD4 interactions. However, our results suggest that interaction of highly opsonized HIV-1 with Fc gamma Rs through BsAbs may reduce viral infectivity through Fc gamma R-mediated cytotoxic mechanisms and, therefore, that BsAbs offer promise as therapeutic reagents in HIV-1 infections."

As part of a study evaluating responses to a recombinant gp160 vaccine, we have used quantitative three-color flow cytometry (QFCM) to further investigate the relationships among several measures of lymphocyte activation/immunological status. Parameters evaluated included 1) absolute circulating counts for the major lymphocyte phenotypes (T, B, NK) and selected activated/regulatory subsets believed to have clinical value in the monitoring of patients with HIV infection; 2) level of CD38 expression (antibody-binding capacity [ABC]) on the lymphocyte subsets defined by CD8, CD38, and HLA-DR; and 3) serum levels of soluble CD8. CD8+DR+CD38+ counts were found to be markedly increased (approximately 10-fold) in HIV+ individuals, whereas CD4+CD45RA+ counts were markedly decreased (approximately 5-fold). We confirmed previous reports that CD38 expression on CD8 T cells (here reported as CD38 ABC) are increased in asymptomatic HIV+ individuals as compared with healthy controls, and further found that CD38 ABC was elevated approximately 2-fold on CD8+DR+ cells as compared with CD8+DR- cells in healthy controls, and almost 2-fold further elevated on CD8+DR+ cells in HIV+ individuals compared with CD8+DR+ cells in healthy controls. In agreement with previous studies, we found increased serum CD8 levels (sCD8) and increased CD8+DR+ counts in asymptomatic HIV+ individuals. However, when sCD8 was expressed relative to CD8+DR+ cell counts (RsCD8), this index was found to be significantly decreased in HIV+ individuals. Although CD38 ABC on CD8+DR+ cells showed no correlation with sCD8, it was significantly correlated with RsCD8 in both HIV+ and HIV- individuals. Absolute lymphocyte counts were strongly correlated with both CD38 ABC and RsCD8 in HIV+ individuals. However, CD4 counts were correlated with CD38 ABC (but not RsCD8) in HIV+ patients and with RsCD8 (but not CD38 ABC) in HIV-controls. Our results suggest that QFCM is significant in understanding the role of CD8+DR+CD38+ cells in processes such as lymphocyte homeostasis and HIV-induced CD4-cell depletion."

A total of 249 patients (12.6%) had a GFR between 60 and 89 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 3.1% had a GFR between 30 and 59, 0.3% had a GFR between 15 and 29, and 0.4% had a GFR <15. Decreased GFR was found in only 74 patients (3.8%). In the multivariate regression model, the factors that were independently associated with a GFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were as follows: age ≥ 50 years (PR = 3.4; 95% CI: 1.7-6.8), diabetes (PR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2-3.4), hypertension (PR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.3-3.2), current CD4+ cell count <350 cells/mm3 (PR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3-3.3), past exposure to tenofovir (PR = 4.7; 95% CI: 2.3-9.4) and past exposure to indinavir (PR =1.7; 95% CI: 1.0-2.8). As in high-income countries, CKD was the predominant form of kidney involvement among HIV-infected individuals in our setting. The risk factors associated with decreased glomerular filtration were broad and included virus-related factors as well as degenerative and nephrotoxic factors. Despite the potential for nephrotoxicity associated with some antiretroviral drugs, in the short-term, advanced chronic renal disease remains very rare."

This report summarizes the investigation of four outbreaks of HBV and HCV infections that occurred in outpatient health-care settings. The investigation of each outbreak suggested that unsafe injection practices, primarily reuse of syringes and needles or contamination of multiple-dose medication vials, led to patient-to-patient transmission. To prevent transmission of bloodborne pathogens, all health-care workers should adhere to recommended standard precautions and fundamental infection-control principles, including safe injection practices and appropriate aseptic techniques."

The study subjects consisted of 181 children with the past or ongoing hepatitis B virus infection who were investigated during the nationwide serosurvey conducted in 2004. The prevalence of antibody to HDV was 6.1%, with the proportion of 13.6% among hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive subjects, all of whom had HDV RNA. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that injections (> 11 times) (odds ratio [OR] = 8.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28-54.07) and blood sampling (> 3 times) (OR = 5.34, 95% CI = 1.12-25.53) in health care settings, hospitalization (> 3 times) (OR = 6.20, 95% CI = 1.18-32.71), and cohabitating with patients with chronic hepatitis (OR = 4.57, 95% CI = 1.26-16.55) predicted the seropositivity for antibody to HDV. These results suggest that parenteral exposures in health care settings and household transmission are the main routes of HDV transmission among Mongolian children."

Because HBV and HCV are transmitted efficiently percutaneously, possible transmission in health-care settings is of particular concern. Public health investigations of cases of HBV and HCV infection suspected to be associated with health-care delivery play an essential role in identifying unsafe practices and controlling health-care-associated viral hepatitis transmission. However, these investigations are resource intensive, and frequently overwhelm health department resources. Over many years, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) developed a systematic approach to guide investigation and public health response to case reports of acute HBV or HCV infection in patients whose infection was potentially associated with health-care delivery. In this approach, the least resource-intensive investigation components are conducted for each case, and decisions to expand the investigation to more resource-intensive components are guided by the likelihood that a single case report represents a cluster of health-care-associated infections (HAIs). This report describes the DOHMH approach in the context of two single case reports. Components of this approach might be useful to other health departments that are developing their own approaches to this type of investigation."

Virus detection was monitored by assaying culture supernatants for the presence of Mg++-dependent reverse transcriptase (R.T.) activity. A number of these virus-positive sups were passaged repeatedly in cultures of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated and Interleukin-2 (IL-2) treated fresh lymphocytes from healthy blood donors. Occasionally, multiple samples were obtained at varying time intervals from the same patient and consistently yielded detectable retroviral activity. Several isolates were characterized as closely related if not identical to HIV, HTLV-IIIB strain, since cells from either patients' own lymphocyte cultures or subcultures infected with passaged virus were stained in an indirect immunofluorescent assay with both patients sera and monoclonal antibody against p24 antigen of the HTLV-IIIB strain. Representative isolates, grown on fresh lymphocytes of healthy donors and metabolically labelled with 35S-cysteine, were also analyzed in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) against patients' sera to define their antigenic pattern, which was widely superimposable to that obtained with HTLV-IIIB-infected H9 cells.

Forty-three HIV-seropositive (HIV+) subjects with known time for seroconversion were included in this cross-sectional study. They were divided into the following groups for comparison: persons with and without AIDS, persons who had seroconverted > 72 and < 72 months before entering the study, persons with or without previous severe primary infection, persons who had developed AIDS > 72 and <72 months before entering the study. Furthermore, the HIV+ group was compared with an HIV-seronegative (HIV-) age- and sex-matched group. There was no difference in the proportion of total naive relative to total memory cells between HIV+ and HIV- subjects, showing an equal loss of naive and memory CD4+ cells in this study. Moreover, there was no difference in the proportion of total naive relative to memory CD8+ cells, showing an equal increase in both subgroups of CD8+ cells in HIV+ subjects. However, HIV+ subjects who had experienced severe primary symptoms resembled the AIDS group regarding shift in the CD8 phenotype from naive to memory and by down-regulation of amounts of CD45RA protein. Furthermore, the results showed that during infection with HIV the amounts of both CD45RA and CD45RO markers on CD4+ cells and CD45RA on CD8+ cells were down-regulated, although with different kinetics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Proviral sequences were detected at a high copy number in lymphoid tissue of both presymptomatic patients and patients with AIDS, whereas significant infection of nonlymphoid tissue such as that from brains, spinal cords, and lungs were confined to those with AIDS. V3 loop sequences from both groups showed highly restricted sequence variability and a low overall positive charge of the encoded amino acid sequence compared with those of standard laboratory isolates of HIV type 1 (HIV-1). The low charge and the restriction in sequence variability were comparable to those observed with isolates showing a non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) and macrophage-tropic phenotype in vitro. All patients were either exclusively infected (six of seven cases) or predominantly infected (one case) with variants with a predicted NSI/macrophage-tropic phenotype, irrespective of the degree of disease progression. p24 antigen was detected by immunocytochemical staining of paraffin-fixed sections in the germinal centers within lymphoid tissue, although little or no antigen was found in areas of lymph node or spleen containing T lymphocytes from either presymptomatic patients or patients with AIDS. The predominant p24 antigen-expressing cells in the lungs and brains of the patients with AIDS were macrophages and microglia (in brains), frequently forming multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) even though the V3 loop sequences of these variants resembled those of NSI isolates in vitro. These studies indicate that lack of syncytium-forming ability in established T-cell lines does not necessarily predict syncytium-forming ability in primary target cells in vivo. Furthermore, variants of HIV with V3 sequences characteristic of NSI/macrophage-tropic isolates form the predominant population in a range of lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues in vivo, even in patients with AIDS."

HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment is a significant burden to persons living with HIV infection, caregivers, and the health care system. Neurocognitive changes associated with HIV are typically subcortical, consisting of the triad of cognitive, behavior, and motor dysfunction. HIV-associated dementia and HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment are clinical diagnostic syndromes with neuropsychological performance testing, neuroimaging, and cerebral spinal fluid studies providing additional information.

To characterize Brazilian strains of HIV-1, we studied 24 viruses isolated from blood samples of HIV-1-positive patients from different regions of the country. To examine the cell tropism and the virus ability to form syncytia, primary macrophages and the CD4+ T cell line MT-2 were infected with these viruses. We found that 22 isolates replicated well in macrophages (macrophage-tropic isolates), 2 infected only MT-2 cells (T cell line tropic variants), while 6 of them grew in both cells. We found 8 syncytium-inducing (SI) and 16 non-SI (NSI) isolates. Continuous cultures of 18 isolates were established in the CCR5+/CXCR4+ cell line PM-1, and SI/NSI features of these viruses were confirmed by cell fusion assay with uninfected CD4+ T cell lines (PM-1, MT-2, H9, and SUP-T1). The coreceptor usage of 18 isolates was investigated by infecting U87 cells transfected with CD4 and chemokine receptors, and we found that 11 isolates infected only CCR5+ cells, 3 only CXCR4+ cells, whereas 4 used both coreceptors. We also observed that X4 isolates were more sensitive to neutralization by dextran sulfate than R5 or R5X4 viruses. Our findings show that the Brazilian isolates are phenotypically similar to those prevalent in other regions, which could mean that therapeutic strategies based on HIV-1 phenotypic properties would be efficient in Brazil, as in other countries."

Sixty serum samples collected from drug users in 1980 and 1983, before the founding of the Center (1985), were tested as well. Some demographic and behavioral risk factors were studied in a subgroup of intravenous drug users enrolled in 1985, 1987, and 1990 for their possible association with HIV-1. These factors were also studied in relation to hepatitis B virus infection, since both viruses share the same modes of spread. These drug users had a higher prevalence of markers for hepatitis B virus than of HIV-1 antibodies, and the prevalence rates in sera collected declined over time for both infections. The presence of both antibodies to HIV-1 and markers for hepatitis B virus was independently associated with the age of the drug user, the duration of drug use, and the year of serum collection. Antibodies to HIV-1 were observed more frequently in females than in males. No relation was found between education or employment status and the presence of HIV-1 antibodies or hepatitis B virus markers. Although new HIV-1 infections still occur, the decline in seroprevalence observed at the end of the 1980s might be related to modifications in social behavior among newer drug users, partial exhaustion of the susceptible population, and increasing risk awareness in more experienced users."

However, no study to date has examined whether monoclonal antibodies, small molecules, or other nonchemokine agents possess broad-spectrum activity against the major genetic subtypes of HIV-1. PRO 140 (PA14) is an anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibody that potently inhibits HIV-1 entry at concentrations that do not affect CCR5's chemokine receptor activity. In this study, PRO 140 was tested against a panel of primary HIV-1 isolates selected for their genotypic and geographic diversity. In quantitative assays of viral infectivity, PRO 140 was compared with RANTES, a natural CCR5 ligand that can inhibit HIV-1 entry by receptor downregulation as well as receptor blockade. Despite their divergent mechanisms of action and binding epitopes on CCR5, low nanomolar concentrations of both PRO 140 and RANTES inhibited infection of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by all CCR5-using (R5) viruses tested. This is consistent with there being a highly restricted pattern of CCR5 usage by R5 viruses. In addition, a panel of 25 subtype C South African R5 viruses were broadly inhibited by PRO 140, RANTES, and TAK-779, although approximately 30-fold-higher concentrations of the last compound were required. Interestingly, significant inhibition of a dualtropic subtype C virus was also observed. Whereas PRO 140 potently inhibited HIV-1 replication in both PBMC and primary macrophages, RANTES exhibited limited antiviral activity in macrophage cultures. Thus CCR5-targeting agents such as PRO 140 can demonstrate potent and genetic-subtype-independent anti-HIV-1 activity."

However, the population dynamics of transmitted resistance remains unclear, although previous models have assumed that such transmission reflects direct infection from treated individuals. We investigated whether population-based phylogenetic analyses would uncover lineages of resistant viruses circulating in untreated individuals. Through the phylogenetic analysis of 14,061 HIV type 1 (HIV-1) pol gene sequences generated in the United Kingdom from both treatment-naïve and -experienced individuals, we identified five treatment-independent viral clusters containing mutations conferring cross-resistance to antiretroviral drugs prescribed today in the United Kingdom. These viral lineages represent sustainable reservoirs of resistance among new HIV infections, independent of treatment. Dated phylogenies reconstructed through Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo inference indicated that these reservoirs originated between 1997 and 2003 and have persisted in the HIV-infected population for up to 8 years. Since our cohort does not represent all infected individuals within the United Kingdom, our results are likely to underestimate the number and size of the resistant reservoirs circulating among drug-naïve patients. The existence of sustained reservoirs of resistance in the absence of treatment has the capacity to threaten the long-term efficacy of antiretroviral therapy and suggests there is a limit to the decline of transmitted drug resistance. Given the current decrease in resistance transmitted from treated individuals, a greater proportion of resistance is likely to come from drug-naïve lineages. These findings provide new insights for the planning and management of treatment programs in resource-rich and developing countries."

HBV reactivation is most commonly reported in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy, especially rituximab-containing therapy for hematological malignancies and those receiving stem cell transplantation. All patients with hematological malignancies receiving anticancer therapy should be screened for active or resolved HBV infection by blood tests for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Patients found to be positive for HBsAg should be given prophylactic antiviral therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. For patients with resolved HBV infection, no standard strategy has yet been established to prevent HBV reactivation. There are usually two options. One is pre-emptive therapy guided by serial HBV DNA monitoring, whereby antiviral therapy is given as soon as HBV DNA becomes detectable. However, there is little evidence regarding the optimal interval and period of monitoring. An alternative approach is prophylactic antiviral therapy, especially for patients receiving high-risk therapy such as rituximab, newer generation of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, obinutuzumab or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This strategy may effectively prevent HBV reactivation and avoid the inconvenience of repeated HBV DNA monitoring. Entecavir or tenofovir are preferred over lamivudine as prophylactic therapy. Although there is no well-defined guideline on the optimal duration of prophylactic therapy, there is growing evidence to recommend continuing prophylactic antiviral therapy for at least 12 mo after cessation of chemotherapy, and even longer for those who receive rituximab or who had high serum HBV DNA levels before the start of immunosuppressive therapy. Many novel agents have recently become available for the treatment of hematological malignancies, and these agents may be associated with HBV reactivation. Although there is currently limited evidence to guide the optimal preventive measures, we recommend antiviral prophylaxis in HBsAg-positive patients receiving novel treatments, especially the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, which are B-cell receptor signaling modulators and reduce proliferation of malignant B-cells. Further studies are needed to clarify the risk of HBV reactivation with these agents and the best prophylactic strategy in the era of targeted therapy for hematological malignancies. "

Higher levels of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication were observed in these new hu-PBL-scid mice than in conventional hu-PBL-C.B-17-scid mice. In one particular strain, hu-PBL-NOD-scid mice, high levels of HIV-1 viremia (more than 10(6) 50% infectious doses per ml) were detected after infection with HIV-1. The plasma viral load was about 100 to 1,000 times higher than that observed in other hu-PBL-scid mice infected with HIV-1. Although high-level viremia did not correlate with the total amount of HIV-1 RNA in cells from infected mice, high levels of free virions were detected only in hu-PBL-NOD-scid mice. HIV-1 viremia induced systemic HIV-1 infection involving the liver, lungs, and brain. PCR in situ hybridization confirmed that HIV-1-infected cells invaded the brain tissue of the hu-PBL-NOD-scid mice. Our results suggest that the genetic background, including innate immunity, is critical in the development of primary HIV-1 viremia and subsequent central nervous system invasion with HIV-1. The hu-PBL-NOD-scid mouse represents a useful model for the study of the pathogenesis of HIV-1 in vivo, especially brain involvement, and therapy of primary HIV-1 viremia."

HCV antibody prevalence among non-injection users of drugs such as heroin and cocaine is between 5 and 30%, although there are scant data on specific transmission risk behavior. The control of HIV/HCV co-infection must address HCV prevention. Epidemiological studies have suggested that HCV prevalence in IDU is subject to various influences, some of which may be modifiable by interventions. However, studies have not shown consistent effects of various prevention strategies on HCV transmission, including studies of HCV screening and education, drug treatment or needle exchange. Although some large cross-sectional studies in regions where needle exchange is available to a large number of drug injectors have reported declining HCV prevalence, the scale of services needed is a matter of considerable debate and has not been systematically quantified.

HIV-infected and HIV-negative women at risk for HIV enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) during October 1994 to November 1995 and again between October 2001 and November 2002 were studied. Clinical and demographic factors associated with HCV seroprevalence were assessed in multivariate logistic regression models controlling for history of blood transfusion and IDU. Among 3636 women with HCV results, 31.5% were HCV antibody positive (HCV+) including 13.5% with no reported history of IDU or blood transfusions. Multivariate logistic regression analyses stratified on IDU showed that among women with no history of IDU, sex with an IDU male was independently associated with HCV positivity (odds ratio [OR] = 2.8, 95% confidence [CI] = 2.1, 3.8, p < 0.0001) after controlling for blood transfusion, age, HIV infection, unemployment, birth in the United States, history of hepatitis B infection, and current smoking status.

However, the benefits of HIV protease inhibitors are compromised by numerous undesirable side effects. These include peripheral fat wasting and excessive central fat deposition (lipodystrophy), overt hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. The mechanism associated with protease inhibitor-induced metabolic abnormalities is multifactorial. One major effect of the protease inhibitor is its suppression of the breakdown of the nuclear form of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (nSREBP) in the liver and adipose tissues. Hepatic accumulation of nSREBP results in increased fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, whereas nSREBP accumulation in adipose tissue causes lipodystrophy, reduces leptin expression, and promotes insulin resistance. The HIV protease inhibitors also suppress proteasome-mediated breakdown of nascent apolipoprotein (apo) B, thus resulting in the overproduction and secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Finally, protease inhibitor also suppresses the inhibition of the glucose transporter GLUT-4 activity in adipose and muscle. This latter effect also contributes directly to insulin resistance and diabetes. These adverse effects need to be alleviated for long-term use of protease inhibitor therapy in treatment of HIV infection."

Raltegravir (RAL) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, that is now increasingly, used for treating HIV infections because it has few adverse effects. This retrospective analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of combined ABC/3TC and RAL in both treatment-naïve and -experienced Japanese patients with HIV infections. In all 11 treatment-naïve patients (100%), virological suppression to undetectable level was achieved. Liver transaminases, renal function, and serum lipid profiles showed no exacerbations up to 48 weeks of treatment. In 12 patients who were switched from previous regimens to ABC/3TC and RAL, HIV viral load was undetectable in 11 patients (91.6%), but remained detectable in 1 patient with poor adherence. Major reasons for switching regimens to ABC/3TC and RAL were hyperlipidemia and nausea. After switching, these adverse effects improved, and no new adverse effects were observed. Despite the small number of participants in this study, the results support the combination of ABC/3TC and RAL as a possible treatment choice in Japanese individuals with HIV-infection. "

HIV-1 infection of cord blood and adult MDM was accomplished after incubating 10-15-d-old cultures for 4 h with a monocyte-tropic strain of HIV-1 (Bal). After 1 wk in culture cell supernatants were tested for reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. MDM were exposed to 5, 10 and 20 mM concentrations of both GSH and NAC before infection, during infection, and after infection was established. GSH and NAC suppressed the replication of HIV-1 in both primary cord blood and adult donor MDM in a concentration dependent fashion. These suppressive effects were more pronounced in cord-derived cells than in adult-derived cells. In cells treated with GSH or NAC before infection, there was no significant rise in RT activity as compared with controls. Similarly, when cells were treated with GSH and NAC and simultaneously infected, there was also no significant rise in RT activity after 1 wk in culture. In cells treated after infection was established, RT values were suppressed 80-90% that of untreated controls. This effect persisted for 1-2 wk after exposure to GSH and NAC. Untreated controls demonstrated syncytium formation and lost characteristics of spreading and elongation 2 wk after HIV-1 infection, whereas most of the treated cells remained free of syncytium and retained cytoplasmic spreading, adherence, and elongation. These data are consistent with other studies of thiol suppression of HIV-1 replication and demonstrate a similar observation for primary cultured cord MDM. These results may offer new approaches toward cellular protection after infection with HIV-1."

In this study we adapted an en face preparation technique of endothelium for use in immunohistochemistry and investigated the aortic endothelium of pre-AIDS and AIDS patients (n = 32) in comparison with an HIV-negative group (n = 17). The control group showed a regular pattern of evenly distributed aortic endothelial cells, whereas the endothelial cell pattern in the HIV-1-infected patients was clearly disturbed. Simultaneously, the degree of leukocyte adherence on the aortic endothelium increased significantly. These changes were accompanied by an up-regulation of the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin (ELAM-1). The endothelium turnover increased, and one-half of the HIV-1-infected patients exhibited HLA-DR (major histocompatibility complex class II) antigen in the aortic endothelium. Our results provide evidence for a profound and repeated injury with regeneration and activation of the endothelium in HIV-1 infection. Injury as well as activation of the endothelium impairs its normal regulatory properties. This could have consequences for the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier; it might influence the immunologically important interaction of the endothelium with T cells; and it might trigger Kaposi's sarcoma."
2735,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can occur in a number of situations unique to, or more common among, children and adolescents. Guidelines for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for occupational and nonoccupational (eg, sexual, needle-sharing) exposures to HIV have been published by the US Public Health Service, but they do not directly address nonoccupational HIV exposures unique to children (such as accidental exposure to human milk from a woman infected with HIV or a puncture wound from a discarded needle on a playground), and they do not provide antiretroviral drug information relevant to PEP in children. This clinical report reviews issues of potential exposure of children and adolescents to HIV and gives recommendations for PEP in those situations. The risk of HIV transmission from nonoccupational, nonperinatal exposure is generally low. Transmission risk is modified by factors related to the source and extent of exposure. Determination of the HIV infection status of the exposure source may not be possible, and data on transmission risk by exposure type may not exist. Except in the setting of perinatal transmission, no studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of postexposure use of antiretroviral drugs for the prevention of HIV transmission in nonoccupational settings. Antiretroviral therapy used for PEP is associated with significant toxicity. The decision to initiate prophylaxis needs to be made in consultation with the patient, the family, and a clinician with experience in treatment of persons with HIV infection. If instituted, therapy should be started as soon as possible after an exposure-no later than 72 hours-and continued for 28 days. Many clinicians would use 3 drugs for PEP regimens, although 2 drugs may be considered in certain circumstances. Instruction for avoiding secondary transmission should be given. Careful follow-up is needed for psychologic support, encouragement of medication adherence, toxicity monitoring, and serial HIV antibody testing."
3756,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"During human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, patients develop various levels of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses. In some cases, patient sera can potently neutralize diverse strains of HIV-1, but the antibody specificities that mediate this broad neutralization are not known, and their elucidation remains a formidable challenge. Due to variable and nonneutralizing determinants on the exterior envelope glycoprotein (Env), nonnative Env protein released from cells, and the glycan shielding that assembles in the context of the quaternary structure of the functional spike, HIV-1 Env elicits a myriad of binding antibodies. However, few of these antibodies can neutralize circulating viruses. We present a systematic analysis of the NAb specificities of a panel of HIV-1-positive sera, using methodologies that identify both conformational and continuous neutralization determinants on the HIV-1 Env protein. Characterization of sera included selective adsorption with native gp120 and specific point mutant variants, chimeric virus analysis, and peptide inhibition of viral neutralization. The gp120 protein was the major neutralizing determinant for most sera, although not all neutralization activity against all viruses could be identified. In some broadly neutralizing sera, the gp120-directed neutralization mapped to the CD4 binding region of gp120. In addition, we found evidence that regions of the gp120 coreceptor binding site may also be a target of neutralizing activity. Sera displaying limited neutralization breadth were mapped to the immunogenic V3 region of gp120. In a subset of sera, we also identified NAbs directed against the conserved, membrane-proximal external region of gp41. These data allow a more detailed understanding of the humoral responses to the HIV-1 Env protein and provide insights regarding the most relevant targets for HIV-1 vaccine design."

Study participants were voluntary individuals 18 years of age or older recruited from AIDS Center VCT unit in Tbilisi, Georgia. Eligibility criteria of participants were: HIV positive result confirmed by western blot; age; and voluntary participation. Total 175 patients undergo interview with specially designed questionnaires. Most of the participants were male (71.4%), age range of HIV positives varied from 20 to 77 years old. Prevalence of HCV among HIV positive patients is high. Almost half (48.57%) HIV positive patients are co-infected with HCV. Men were more likely than women co-infected with HCV (60.80% and 18% accordingly). Major risk factor of male co-infection was related to drug use, needle and injection equipment sharing. Prevalence of HCV among injecting drug users was (73.40%). Drug users had 3.25 times more risk (PR 3.25; 95%CI; CL--1.89-5.26; p<0.01) to be infected with HCV compare non IDUs. Prevalence of being infected with HBV (Anti-HBc) among HIV positives was 43.42% (76/175) and the prevalence of Chronic HBV (HBsAg positive) was 6.86% (12/175). Prevalence rate of HBsAg among IDUs was 8.51% and among non IDU participants 5.26%. Triple infection (HIV, Hepatitis C and chronic form of Hepatitis B--HBsAg) was among 9 patients (5.14%). Infections were associated with injection drug use (88.88%) and mostly were related to share of needles/syringes and other injecting medical equipment. Transmission of HBV and HCV by sexual contact was not observed among those 9 participants. High risk behavior among HIV positive participants mostly related to drug use and unprotected sex with non regular partners. Other risk factors for Hepatitis transmission were associated with invasive medical manipulations, blood transfusion, surgery, abortions and etc. None of cases of HIV, or Hepatitis (B, C) transmission through medical manipulations can be documentary proved based on those research data."

We examined trends in the incidence of HCC among a population-based cohort of people infected with HBV or HCV. HBV and HCV cases notified to the New South Wales Health Department between 1992 and 2007 were linked to the Central Cancer Registry, Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and National HIV/AIDS Registries. Crude HCC incidence rates were estimated using person-time methodology. Age-standardized incidence rates were calculated using the 2001 Australian population. Trends in incidence were examined using join point regression models. Between 1992 and 2007, 1201 people had a linked HCC record: 556 of those with HBV; 592 with HCV; 45 with HBV/HCV co-infection; and 8 with HIV co-infection. The overall age-standardized HCC incidence rates declined non-significantly from 148.0 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 63.7, 287.4) per 100,000 population in 1995 to 101.2 (95% CI 67.3, 144.6) in 2007 among the HBV monoinfected group and significantly from 151.8 (95% CI 62.4, 299.8) per 100,000 population to 75.3 (95% CI 50.8, 105.5) among the HCV monoinfected group. However, incidence rates in the HCV monoinfected group progressively increased from the period 1992-1997 to 2004-2007 when adjusted for age, sex, and birth cohort, and the total number of cases per annum continued to increase. Despite declines in the age-adjusted incidence rates of HCC over time, the absolute number of cases increased likely due to the ageing cohort and an increasing prevalence of both hepatitis B and C in Australia."

A tuberculin test (2 TU PPD RT23) was used, and the presence of mycobacteria was checked through direct microscopy and culturing blood, urine, feces, and gastric aspirate. When clinically indicated, samples of cerebrospinal fluid, bone marrow, and sputum were also examined and cultivated. The absence of reactivity to tuberculin was significantly more frequent in the patients than in the controls (91.3%, compared to 57.4%; chi 2 = 33, P = 0). The prevalence of tuberculosis was 6.5%, in comparison with 0.04% among a group of HIV-negative ISS members (exact binomial 95% confidence interval: 0.0313% to 0.1154%). Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), present in 43 patients, were significantly more frequent than Mycobacterium tuberculosis (27.7%, versus 6.5%; chi 2 = 24.78, P = 0.000,001), but they caused illness only in some cases. The most common species were those of the M. avium-intracellulare complex. M. avium-intracellulare and M. fortuitum had a total prevalence of 7.1% and were the most-prevalent NTM that caused disease in these patients (4.5%); they were also responsible for three cases of disseminated infection. Clinical disease caused by M. tuberculosis or NTM and complete tuberculin anergy were associated with stage-IV HIV infection and with CD4 lymphocyte counts < or = 400/microL. However, the lack of immunocellular response, shown by limited tuberculin reactivity, was found beginning with the asymptomatic HIV carrier stage. The progressive deterioration of the immune system of HIV-positive patients is the determining factor in the high morbidity and mortality with mycobacteria infections and requires prompt chemoprophylaxis or treatment."

In a randomized, prospective study evaluating the effectiveness of epoetin alfa in maintaining RBV dose, alleviating anemia, and improving HRQL in anemic (Hb < or = 12 g/dL) HCV-infected patients receiving combination therapy, patients receiving epoetin alfa had significant improvements in HRQL compared with placebo. In this study, 185 patients were randomized to 40,000 units of epoetin alfa subcutaneously weekly or placebo for an 8-week double-blind phase (DBP), followed by an 8-week open-label phase during which all patients received epoetin alfa. To further assess the impact of epoetin alfa on HRQL, post hoc analyses were conducted in the same patient population to compare the HRQL of these patients at randomization with norms of other populations, and to determine the critical relationship between hemoglobin (Hb) levels and HRQL. Mean HRQL scores of anemic HCV-infected patients receiving combination therapy at randomization were significantly lower than those of both the general population and patients who had other chronic conditions. Patients receiving epoetin alfa who had the greatest Hb increases from randomization to the end of the DBP also had the largest improvements in HRQL. Hb improvement was an independent predictor of HRQL improvement in these patients. In conclusion, epoetin alfa provided clinically significant HRQL improvement in HCV-infected patients receiving IFN/RBV therapy."

The study involved 30 HIV/HCV co-infected patients naive to anti- HCV therapy. One patient in each arm (6.7%) discontinued anti-HCV therapy because of adverse events. There were no significant between-group differences in terms of the proportion of patients experiencing AEs (p=0.999) or the number of grade 3-4 AEs (p=0.146). No HIV failure was observed. The safety profile of LPV/r monotherapy was similar to that of LPV/r-based HAART, thus encouraging HAART simplification in patients receiving anti-HCV treatment."

Although HIV/AIDS remained the leading underlying cause of death among HIV/AIDS patients during the study period (552/752 = 73.4%), an increased proportion of deaths was due to non-HIV/AIDS causes (other infectious diseases, cancers, liver diseases, etc.) after the introduction of HAART in 1997. Deaths from suicide increased threefold, from three (1.5% of total) in 1994-1996 to 14 (4.8%) in 2000-2002. Most AIDS-related conditions associated with death (cryptococcosis, cachexia/wasting, dementia/encephalopathy, etc.) decreased in frequency from 1998-2000 to 2001-2002. Nonetheless, some AIDS-related conditions associated with death remained stable or increased in frequency, such as candidiasis, tuberculosis, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In conclusion, as the duration of survival increased, the likelihood of suicide also increased. More effort is required to address the mental health of HIV/AIDS patients as a part of therapy."

The frequencies of T215S/Y/F, M41L, D67N, L210W K70R, K219Q mutations, detectable in plasma samples, conferring resistance to zidovudine were 61.2, 56.2, 36.2, 31.5, 27.5 and 17.5%, respectively. Mutations (M184V or M184I) conferring resistance to lamivudine were detected in an extremely high percentage of patients (61%). Among mutations correlated to high (K103N, V106A, Y181C/I, Y188C/H/L, G190A/C/E/Q/S/T) or moderate (V108I, V118I) levels of nevirapine resistance, the predominant amino acid change was a substitution at 103 codon, present in 24 of 80 samples tested. Finally Q151M, the marker mutation able to confer resistance to all nucleoside analogues, was detected in seven patients with a viral load of between 1 x 10(4) and 9 x 10(4) HIV-1 RNA copies/ml. The relationship between the genotype and the viral load showed that the incidence of some specific mutations [M41L, T215Y (correlated to zidovudine resistance) and K103N (correlated to all NNRTIs drugs)] significantly (P=0.001) increased with higher viral load. Our results, albeit limited to a small cohort, showed a high frequency of mutations correlated to drugs in use, suggesting a need for therapeutic change in the near future and demonstrating that the development of genotyping tests helps to guide the therapeutic management of HIV-1 infected people. Our data highlight the dangers of selecting antiretroviral therapy without previous antiretroviral drug testing. Although the cost of these assays is a concern, prescribing inefficacious drugs could create serious problems for HIV-1 patients."

The aims of the present study were to determine the frequency of resistance-associated mutations in these patients, and to assess the contribution of drug resistance to treatment outcome. Among 29 patients on HAART for > or =6 months, virological, failure was observed in 27 (93%). Genotypic analysis indicated that in five of these 27 patients, there were no mutations that confer resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs). The genotypes of 17 other patients carried one or two RTI mutations, mainly the lamivudine-associated resistance mutation M184V. Three or more RTI mutations were found in only five (14.7%) patients with virological failure, including three patients on the nonnucleoside RTI efavirenz. Major PI mutations were infrequent, and were detected in seven (26%) of 27 patients failing HAART, mainly as single mutation at codons 82 or 90. In contrast, accessory mutations in the protease gene were present in all patients. However, there were significant differences in the prevalence of accessory mutations at codons 36 and 77 among clade B and non-B viruses. When genotypic data of this study were used to change therapy of seven patients whose isolates had multiple resistance mutations, adequate viral suppression was observed in five. Our results indicate that the high rate of treatment failure among patients in Oman is mainly due to factors other than resistance to antiretroviral drugs. These factors, which may include nonadherence to therapy and treatment interruptions, need to be investigated."

In some patients, treatment is not effective and suppression of viral replication is not achieved. Other patients experience toxicity and have to stop treatment or change to a less effective treatment. Several studies have demonstrated a relationship between plasma concentrations of the protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and viral suppression and toxicity. Therapeutic drug monitoring uses drug concentrations to individualize and optimise therapy by dosage adjustments and many clinicians have advocated for the use of therapeutic drug monitoring in HIV antiretroviral therapy. Evidence from a number of randomized clinical trials supports the use of therapeutic drug monitoring, but the studies have limitations and might not apply to all the antiretroviral drugs. However, the consensus is that certain patients are very likely to benefit from therapeutic drug monitoring. Additionally, the combination of therapeutic drug monitoring and genotypic or phenotypic resistance testing might further improve antiretroviral therapy."

Amphetamine users were younger, mostly white, and had less-severe drug dependence. Heroin users had significantly higher levels of needle risk, as indicated by frequency of injection, number of persons sharing equipment, and place of injection. Methamphetamine users tended to buy syringes in lots of 10 or more from pharmacies and to use a syringe less than 5 times before discarding it. Heroin users tended to buy 1 needle at a time from an illicit source and to use it more than 20 times. Of methamphetamine users, 71% had more than one sex partner, compared to 39% of heroin users. Partners of methamphetamine users were more likely to be drug injectors than were partners of heroin users. Fewer methamphetamine users reported a behavior change in response to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, and fewer had been contacted by AIDS Education/Outreach. We suggest that efforts to promote risk reduction among methamphetamine users be stepped up because this population has been underserved and because less-sweeping behavior changes are needed to reduce needle-related risks to acceptable levels."

Twenty-two children received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and 21 received double therapy with reverse transcriptase inhibitors. At baseline, no difference in reverse transcriptase or protease inhibitors resistant mutants was present among the groups. After 12 weeks, the two groups were similar regarding proportion of children with reverse transcriptase resistant mutants. Sixteen (73%) HAART-treated children, but no child receiving double therapy had HIV-1 with primary resistance mutations to protease inhibitors. Secondary protease mutations were found in all HAART-treated and in 17/21 (81%) children receiving double therapy. The mutation numbers in reverse transcriptase or protease genes were significantly higher after HAART than after double therapy. Nevertheless, 12 (55%) of HAART-treated children (but no child receiving double therapy) showed immunological recovery. The frequency and number of mutations were similar in HAART-treated children with or without immunological recovery both at baseline and after 12 weeks. The findings suggest, immunological recovery notwithstanding, virological failure is independent of drug-resistant mutations and consequent possible changes in viral fitness."

The main objectives of this study were to define the most common ENTM in HIV children and to observe the difference, when compared to non-infected children. The HIV detection was also correlated with the appearance of the first ENTM. The observational, case-control research involved the study of 40 children over a period of 1 year. It was found that HIV children have a higher occurrence of ENTM, herpes simplex virus gingivostomatitis, cervical lymphadenopathy and parotid hypertrophy. On the other hand, the proportion of children who developed rhinosinusitis, acute otitis media (AOM) and oral candidiasis (OC) were not statistically different among the groups. However, 90% of the HIV children presented at least one ENTM, as opposed to 45% of the immunocompetent children. Differences in the occurrence of the ENTM were noticed, some more suggestive of the HIV infection. Furthermore, the majority of the infected children had their first ENTM diagnosed before the infection of HIV was established."

Unfortunately, there is little information available on the characteristics and emergency clinical problems of HIV-infected patients to guide physicians in patient care and strategies for resource use. Preliminary data from an on-going investigation revealed that there were 254 emergency visits (1.8% of total) by 164 patients with known HIV infection during the four-month period of March to June 1988. Only 171 visits (62%) were likely related to patients' underlying HIV infection. Nine percent of IV drug users (IVDUs) carried a diagnosis of AIDS before presentation compared with 68% of patients who were homosexual or bisexual. Fifty-five patients (21.7%) presented with their first known complication of HIV. Among the 140 risks from patients previously considered asymptomatic, those with homosexual or bisexual risk were 3.6-fold more likely to present with a first-time complication of HIV than were IVDUs. HIV-infected patients were twice as likely to have inadequate insurance compared with a sample of ED seronegative controls. Of the 130 risks by IVDUs, 85% were without adequate insurance coverage compared with 56% of the 91 patient risks from homosexual or bisexuals (P less than .05). Generally, patient presentations did not imply an obvious diagnosis; vague constitutional complaints were the most common (42%). Preliminary interpretation of the data is that IVDUs use emergency services as a routine source of care. Because IVDUs probably represent those with more recent infection and HIV infection continues to spread unabated in this risk group, we can expect increasing numbers of patients to present to EDs with symptomatic HIV infection in the future.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Nearly 60% of infected persons fail their first highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen, partially because of nonadherence, requiring a switch to a second regimen to prevent drug resistance. Among HIV-infected youth, a group with rising infection rates, treatment switch is often delayed; virologic and immunologic consequences of this delay are unknown. We conducted a retrospective, longitudinal study of drug resistance outcomes of initial HAART in U.S. youth enrolled between 1999-2001 in a multicenter, observational study and experiencing delayed switch in their first nonsuppressive treatment regimen for up to 3 years. HIV-1 genotyping was performed on plasma samples collected longitudinally, and changes in drug resistance mutations, CD4+ T cell numbers and viral replication capacity were assessed. Forty-four percent (n = 18) of youth in the parent study experiencing virologic nonsuppression were maintained on their initial HAART regimen for a median of 144 weeks. Drug resistance was detected in 61% (11/18) of subjects during the study. Subjects on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) regimens developed more (8/10) drug resistance mutations than those on protease-inhibitor (PI) regimens (2/7) (p = 0.058). Subjects developing NNRTI-resistance (NNRTI-R), showed a trend toward lower CD4+ T cell gains (median: -6 cells/mm(3) per year) than those without detectable NNRTI-R (median: +149 cells/mm(3) per year) (p = 0.16). HIV-1-infected youth maintained on initial nonsuppressive NNRTI-based HAART regimens are more likely to develop drug-resistant viremia than with PI-based HAART. This finding may have implications for initial treatment regimens and transmission risk in HIV-infected youth, a group with rising infection rates."

The protease gene was sequenced from plasma-derived virus from 116 protease inhibitor-naïve patients. The virological response to a triple-drug regimen containing indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir was evaluated every 3 months for as long as 2 years (n = 40). A total of 36 different amino acid substitutions compared to the reference sequence (HIV-1 HXB2) were detected. No substitutions at the active site similar to the primary resistance mutations were found. The most frequent substitutions (prevalence, >10%) at baseline were located at codons 15, 13, 12, 62, 36, 64, 41, 35, 3, 93, 77, 63, and 37 (in ascending order of frequency). The mean number of polymorphisms was 4.2. A relatively poorer response to therapy was associated with a high number of baseline polymorphisms and, to a lesser extent, with the presence of I93L at baseline in comparison with the wild-type virus. A71V/T was slightly associated with a poorer response to first-line ritonavir-based therapy. In summary, within clade B viruses, protease gene natural polymorphisms are common. There is evidence suggesting that treatment response is associated with this genetic background, but most of the specific contributors could not be firmly identified. I93L, occurring in about 30% of untreated patients, may play a role, as A71V/T possibly does in ritonavir-treated patients."

Because the surface gene of HBV overlaps completely the polymerase gene, the incidence and profile of surface and polymerase gene mutations were investigated prospectively in chronic HBV patients who were on lamivudine therapy. Twenty-six patients with chronic liver disease confirmed histologically were included in this study. Extracted HBV DNA from sera samples were subjected to PCR amplification for the mutation prone regions of the surface and polymerase genes of the HBV genome. The emergence of mutant forms and biochemical derangements were studied carefully during the course of the therapy. In six of 26 (23%) patients, mutations emerged on lamivudine therapy. YM552I/VDD resistant mutants were observed in one (6%) and five (29%) patients at Month 12 and 18, respectively, out of 17 patients, who had completed more than 9 months of therapy. The mean time of emergence of resistance was 16.4 +/- 6.8 months. In three of the five patients, emergence of YM552I/VDD mutation was accompanied with a rise in HBV DNA levels. In two patients, mutations were noticed at the end of the viral breakthrough; when the DNA level went down to undetectable levels (<0.5 pg/mL). In two patients, normal ALT levels were found at the time of emergence of the YMDD mutation. YM552I/VDD mutations were observed in 43% of HBeAg positive and 20% of anti-HBe positive patients (P = ns). Although the 'a'-determinant region was found to be unaffected; in one patient, a novel pattern due to emergence of YIDD mutant was observed; the corresponding aa in the S-ORF turned to a stop codon. In summary, the frequency of emergence of YM552I/VDD mutations was 29% at Month 18 in the Indian patients. The presence of normal ALT and low levels of HBV DNA do not exclude the existence of resistant mutants. Novel mutations in the S-ORF, which lead to premature surface gene termination might affect the production of HBsAg and need further study."

In this open-labelled, uncontrolled trial, 19 patients with AHC, including 12 intravenous drug users (IVDUs), were treated early in the course of the infection with peg-IFN-alpha2b for 12 weeks. Diagnosis was made according to standardized criteria. The HCV RNA decay was analysed during the first 4 weeks of treatment by quantitative branched-DNA and by qualitative RT-PCR. Of the patients, 11 (58%) had genotype 1. Sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved in 14 out of 19 patients (74%) and the mean time to achieve a negative RT-PCR for HCV RNA was 2.5 weeks. The SVR was associated by univariate analysis with peg-IFN dosage < or = 1.33 microg/kg/week (P = 0.026) and HCV RNA level at onset of therapy (P = 0.017). Using a logistic regression model, only peg-IFN dosage > or = 1.33 microg/kg/weekly was significantly associated with SVR (P = 0.0379, OR: 14.7; 95% CI: 1.16-185.2). The SVR was 100% and 83.3%, respectively, in genotype 1 and non-1 infected patients treated with a dosage equal to or higher than 1.33 microg/kg, compared with 40% and 50%, respectively, in those who received a lower dosage.

Recommendations for HBV postexposure management include initiation of the hepatitis B vaccine series to any susceptible, unvaccinated person who sustains an occupational blood or body fluid exposure. Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and/or hepatitis B vaccine series should be considered for occupational exposures after evaluation of the hepatitis B surface antigen status of the source and the vaccination and vaccine-response status of the exposed person. Guidance is provided to clinicians and exposed HCP for selecting the appropriate HBV PEP. Immune globulin and antiviral agents (e.g., interferon with or without ribavirin) are not recommended for PEP of hepatitis C. For HCV postexposure management, the HCV status of the source and the exposed person should be determined, and for HCP exposed to an HCV positive source, follow-up HCV testing should be performed to determine if infection develops. Recommendations for HIV PEP include a basic 4-week regimen of two drugs (zidovudine [ZDV] and lamivudine [3TC]; 3TC and stavudine [d4T]; or didanosine [ddI] and d4T) for most HIV exposures and an expanded regimen that includes the addition of a third drug for HIV exposures that pose an increased risk for transmission. When the source person's virus is known or suspected to be resistant to one or more of the drugs considered for the PEP regimen, the selection of drugs to which the source person's virus is unlikely to be resistant is recommended. In addition, this report outlines several special circumstances (e.g., delayed exposure report, unknown source person, pregnancy in the exposed person, resistance of the source virus to antiretroviral agents, or toxicity of the PEP regimen) when consultation with local experts and/or the National Clinicians' Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline ([PEPline] 1-888-448-4911) is advised. Occupational exposures should be considered urgent medical concerns to ensure timely postexposure management and administration of HBIG, hepatitis B vaccine, and/or HIV PEP."

Rates of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, alcohol use, and rates of antiretroviral uptake were similar by gender. Males reported a higher history of injection drug use (80.3% vs. 48.7%; p<0.01) and tuberculosis infection (18.8% vs. 1.6%; p<0.01). Females were more likely to have had a child (63.3% vs. 31.5%; p<0.01) and be currently raising that child within their residence (49.3% vs. 15.3%; p<0.01).

The number of needlestick accidents increased significantly from 64 in 1986 to 166 in 1996 whereas the number of other exposures decreased from 59 to 44 in these years. The increase was mainly seen in nonhospital based (para)medics. A possible explanation of this increase is greater awareness of the potential infection risk with HIV, hepatitis B or C virus leading to a tendency to report more readily. This assumption is in contradiction with results of studies in hospital-based personnel where a decrease is observed as a result of educational programmes. Other explanations are a higher frequency of use of sharp instruments and (or) an increase in the workload. Out of a total of 1886 needlestick accidents in 1986-1996 one woman became HIV positive; she was deliberately infected by her ex-partner who injected her with blood of an AIDS patient, and one person contracted an hepatitis C virus infection: a policeman wounded by a needle used by a drug addict."

HIV-1 and HCV can be transmitted from person to person by contact with bodily fluids. Both can also be transmitted from mother to child during the course of pregnancy and childbirth. There are currently no vaccines available to immunize against HIV-1 and HCV infection or to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), and accessible treatments have significant yet limited efficacy. However, important progresses have been made since the discovery of HCV and HIV-1 : (a) sensitive screening and detection methods have been perfected ; (b) risk factors for acquisition, replicative cycles, pathogenesis, and mechanisms of transmission have been better characterized ; (c) specific treatments, immunotherapy, and antiretroviral prophylaxis regimen were developed ; (d) immune correlates of protection are better understood ; and (e) vaccine design was undertaken. In addition, co-infection with HCV and HIV-1, which is common among high-risk groups including injection drug users, significantly increases the incidence of MTCT of both viruses. The mechanisms by which this facilitation occurs are still under investigation and may involve direct replicative facilitation, enhancement of placental transfer, and/or interference with host immune responses. Taken together, these developments could lead to the implementation of global scale strategies to prevent MTCT of HCV and HIV-1."

We have compared the sexual practices, recreational drug abuse, history of sexually-transmissible diseases, and antecedent immunological findings of the men who seroconverted with those of 588 subjects who persistently remained seronegative in the same time-period. The cumulative incidence rate of HIV infection over the three years of observation was 8.5%. The cumulative incidence rate ranged from less than 1% for the six months before August 1, 1984, to a peak of 5% in the six months before August 1, 1985. Of those subjects for whom we had data for the period of seroconversion, all but two of the subjects who seroconverted admitted to a recognized high-risk sexual practice in the six months before the first visit at which they were found to be seropositive. Univariate analysis found that men who seroconverted were significantly more likely to have had a greater number of recent sexual partners (relative risk per partner, 1.02; P less than 0.001), to have engaged in receptive anal intercourse (incidence rate ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-7.6; P = 0.01) and to have used nitrite inhalant (incidence rate ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.9; P = 0.02) and amphetamine (incidence rate ratio, 4.8; 95% CI, 2.2-10.5; P less than 0.001) drugs.

Our objective was to describe the epidemiology of P. jirovecii colonization among HIV-positive patients in a cross-sectional, hospital-based study of patients admitted with suspected pneumonia in Kampala, Uganda. P. jirovecii was detectable in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 7 (6%) of 124 consecutive patients with non-Pneumocystis pneumonia. Colonization was not associated with patient demographic or clinical information. This prevalence is substantially lower than in published studies in the developed world and suggests that there is a limited reservoir of organisms for clinical infections in this Ugandan population.

In the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study and the Women's Interagency HIV Study, 918 HIV-1-infected men and women who were not using antiretroviral therapy were followed for a median of 5.8 years between 1996 and 2005. Follow-up yielded 3,629 person-years of observation, during which 286 (31%) of the participants initiated HAART. A marginal structural left-censored linear model for semiannual repeated assessments of viral load showed a 1.9 log(10) decrease in viral load after HAART initiation as compared with nonuse (95% confidence interval: 1.7, 2.2), which remained stable over the course of follow-up but was stronger among men (interaction p < 0.001). This association was attenuated by 10% when the authors ignored the left-censoring of viral load measurements (which comprised 20% of measurements (1,420/7,258)) and attenuated by 57% when the authors adjusted for time-varying covariates in a standard fashion rather than using the marginal structural model. In conclusion, the clinically important protective effect of HAART on dampening viral load appears to be rapid, present at CD4 cell counts greater than 350 cells/mm(3), and sustained beyond 6 years."

To determine whether the complexity of the infecting virus population influences clinical outcome, we examined viral diversity in the HIV-1 envelope sequences present at primary infection in 156 women from Kenya for whom we had follow-up data on viral RNA levels and CD4 T-cell counts. Eighty-nine women had multiple viral genotypes, while 67 women had a single genotype at primary infection. Women who acquired multiple viral genotypes had a significantly higher viral load (median, 4.84 versus 4.64 log(10) copies/ml, P = 0.04) and a significantly lower CD4(+)-T-cell count (median, 416 versus 617 cells/mm(3), P = 0.01) 4 to 24 months after infection compared to women who were infected with a single viral genotype.

In contrast, infected macaques with a low viral load set point (LVL) usually live asymptomatically throughout the observation period, and are therefore referred to as asymptomatic LVL (Asym LVL) macaques. Interestingly, some LVL macaques exhibit diarrhoea and wasting similar to the symptoms of HVL macaques and are termed symptomatic LVL (Sym LVL) macaques. This study tested the hypothesis that Sym LVL macaques have the same degree of intestinal abnormalities as HVL macaques. The proviral DNA loads in lymphoid tissue and the intestines of Sym LVL and Asym LVL macaques were comparable and all infected monkeys showed villous atrophy. Notably, the CD4(+) cell frequencies of lymphoid tissues and intestines in Sym LVL macaques were remarkably lower than those in Asym LVL and uninfected macaques. Furthermore, Sym LVL and HVL macaques exhibited an increased number of activated macrophages. In conclusion, intestinal disorders including CD4(+) cell reduction and abnormal immune activation can be observed in SHIV-KS661-infected macaques independent of virus replication levels."

A selected group of acutely infected subjects was studied to verify both total and 2-long terminal repeat (2-LTR) DNA proviral load during the acute phase of infection and thereafter. Patients were divided in two sex- and age-matched groups: 19 naive individuals who did not receive antiretroviral therapy during the observation period and 20 subjects treated according to current guidelines. Total and 2-LTR HIV-1 DNA proviral load, in addition to RNA viral load and CD4 cell count, were determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at baseline, 6 and 12 months after the first sampling. Total and 2-LTR HIV-1 DNA proviral load exhibited no significant variation at any time in the naive patients (total HIV-1 DNA ranging from 896 + or - 731 to 715 + or - 673 copies/10(5) PBMC and 2-LTR HIV-1 DNA ranging from 94 + or - 105 to 65 + or - 44 copies/10(5) PBMC), whereas a significant reduction in both total HIV-1 DNA (ranging from 997 + or - 676 to 262 + or - 174 copies/10(5) PBMC) and 2-LTR HIV-1 DNA proviral load (ranging from 116 + or - 55 to 26 + or - 35 copies/10(5) PBMC) was detected in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) patients, together with a CD4(+) T cell count increase and RNA load decrease.

However, to date, it remains unknown if a transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV-1 leads to neurological disorders during acute phase of infection. Since it is impossible to answer this question in humans, we studied NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice (NSG) reconstituted with human PBMC (NSG-HuPBL), followed by the peritoneal challenge with the chronic HIV-1JR-FL and the T/F HIV-1BJZS7, respectively. By measuring viral load, P24 antigenemia and P24(+) cells in peripheral blood and various tissue compartments, we found that systemic infections were rapidly established in NSG-HuPBL mice by both HIV-1 strains. Although comparable peripheral viral loads were detected during acute infection, the T/F virus appeared to cause less CD4(+) T cell loss and less numbers of infected cells in different organs and tissue compartments. Both viruses, however, invaded brains with P24(+)/CD3(+) T cells detected primarily in meninges, cerebral cortex and perivascular areas. Critically, brain infections with HIV-1JR-FL but not with HIV-1BJZS7 resulted in damaged neurons together with activated microgliosis and astrocytosis as determined by significantly increased numbers of Iba1(+) microglial cells and GFAP(+) astrocytes, respectively. The increased Iba1(+) microglia was correlated positively with levels of P24 antigenemia and negatively with numbers of NeuN(+) neurons in brains of infected animals. Our findings, therefore, indicate the establishment of two useful NSG-HuPBL models, which may facilitate future investigation of mechanisms underlying HIV-1-induced microgliosis and astrocytosis."

After inoculation with cell-free virus, the persistence of infection was determined for 1 month by monitoring the presence of viral DNA in the cells by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Furthermore, the infectious virus in the culture supernatant was assayed with CEM-SS cells, and attempts to rescue the virus by cocultivation with CEM-SS cells were made. Appraised on the basis of the relative amount of viral DNA and the frequency of positive cocultivation. JEG-3 was the most permissive and BeWo was the least permissive cell line. However, when the cells were transfected with two biologically active molecular clones of HIV-1, the BRU and NDK isolates, all three cell lines turned out to support the production of mature virus progeny to the same extent. The abundance of viral DNA sequences in the infected cells varied with the isolate, showing an overall decline from RF to NDK. The amount of viral DNA in the cells and its expression decreased during the period of observation; this decrease was mirrored in an erosion of the virus recovery rate at cocultivation from 71% recovery on day 8 to failure of isolation on day 32. None of the cell lines expressed detectable amounts of cell surface CD4 molecules when assayed by flow microfluorometry and direct radioimmunoassay. Northern (RNA) blot hybridization analysis of both the total RNA and the mRNA did not reveal any CD4-specific message: nonetheless, by using the PCR, sequences specifically related to the CD4 gene were uncovered. The data demonstrate that the trophoblast-derived cell lines are susceptible to infection with HIV and that they support transient viral replication in the initial phases of infection.

The use of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) leads to multi-lineage human hematopoiesis accompanied by production of a variety of human immune cell types. Population of murine primary and secondary lymphoid organs with human cells occurs, and long-term engraftment has been achieved. Engrafted cells are capable of producing human innate and adaptive immune responses, making these models the most physiologically relevant humanized animal models to date. New models have been successfully infected by a variety of strains of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1), accompanied by virus replication in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs, including the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, the male and female reproductive tracts, and the brain. Multiple forms of virus-induced pathogenesis are present, and human T cell and antibody responses to HIV-1 are detected. These humanized mice are susceptible to a high rate of rectal and vaginal transmission of HIV-1 across an intact epithelium, indicating the potential to study vaccines and microbicides. Antiviral drugs, siRNAs, and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy strategies have all been shown to be effective at reducing viral load and preventing or reversing helper T cell loss in humanized mice, indicating that they will serve as an important preclinical model to study new therapeutic modalities. HIV-1 has also been shown to evolve in response to selective pressures in humanized mice, thus showing that the model will be useful to study and/or predict viral evolution in response to drug or immune pressures. The purpose of this review is to summarize the findings reported to date on all new humanized mouse models (those transplanted with human HSCs) in regards to HIV-1 sexual transmission, pathogenesis, anti-HIV-1 immune responses, viral evolution, pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, and gene therapeutic strategies."
17904,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"In contrast to pathogenic human immunodeficiency virus and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections, chronic SIVagm infections in African green monkeys (AGMs) are characterized by persistently low peripheral and tissue viral loads that correlate with the lack of disease observed in these animals. We report here data on the dynamics of acute SIVagm infection in AGMs that exhibit remarkable similarities with viral replication patterns observed in peripheral blood during the first 2 weeks of pathogenic SIVmac infections. Plasma viremia was evident at day 3 postinfection (p.i.) in AGMs, and rapid viral replication led by days 7 to 10 to peak viremias characterized by high levels of antigenemia (1.2 to 5 ng of p27/ml of plasma), peripheral DNA viral load (10(4) to 10(5) DNA copies/10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC]), and plasma RNA viral load (2 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(8) RNA copies/ml). The lymph node (LN) RNA and DNA viral load patterns were similar to those in blood, with peaks observed between day 7 and day 14. These values in LNs (ranging from 3 x 10(5) to 3 x 10(6) RNA copies/10(6) LN cell [LNC] and 10(3) to 10(4) DNA copies/10(6) LNC) were at no time point higher than those observed in the blood. Both in LNs and in blood, rapid and significant decreases were observed in all infected animals after this peak of viral replication. Within 3 to 4 weeks p. i., antigenemia was no longer detectable and peripheral viral loads decreased to values similar to those characteristic of the chronic phase of infection (10(2) to 10(3) DNA copies/10(6) PBMC and 2 x 10(3) to 2 x 10(5) RNA copies/ml of plasma). In LNs, viral loads declined to 5 x 10(1) to 10(3) DNA copies and 10(4) to 3 x 10(5) RNA copies per 10(6) LNC at day 28 p.i. and continued to decrease until day 84 p.i. (<10 to 3 x 10(4) RNA copies/10(6) LNC). Despite extensive viremia during primary infection, neither follicular hyperplasia nor CD8(+) cell infiltration into LN germinal centers was detected. Altogether, these results indicate that the nonpathogenic outcome of SIVagm infection in its natural host is associated with a rapidly induced control of viral replication in response to SIVagm infection, rather than with a poorly replicating virus or a constitutive host genetic resistance to virus replication."
13436,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Monocytes are precursors of tissue macrophages, which are major targets of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Although few blood monocytes are infected, their resulting activation could play a key role in the pathogenesis of HIV disease by modulating their transendothelial migration and inducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS participate in chronic inflammation, HIV replication, and the apoptosis of immune system cells seen in HIV-infected subjects. Published data on monocyte activation are controversial, possibly because most studies have involved monocytes isolated from their blood environment by various procedures that may alter cell responses. We therefore used flow cytometry to study, in whole blood, the activation and redox status of monocytes from HIV-infected patients at different stages of the disease. We studied the expression of adhesion molecules, actin polymerization, and cellular levels of H2O2, Bcl-2, and thioredoxin. Basal H2O2 production correlated with viral load and was further enhanced by bacterial N-formyl peptides and endotoxin. The enhanced H2O2 production by monocytes from asymptomatic untreated patients with CD4(+) cell counts above 500/microliter was associated with a decrease in the levels of Bcl-2 and thioredoxin. In contrast, in patients with AIDS, Bcl-2 levels returned to normal and thioredoxin levels were higher than in healthy controls. Restoration of these antioxidant and antiapoptotic molecules might explain, at least in part, why monocyte numbers remain relatively stable throughout the disease. Alterations of adhesion molecule expression and increased actin polymerization could play a role in transendothelial migration of these activated monocytes."

Although there have been studies that have examined the role of sociodemographic variables in people with HIV, there have only been a few on the assessment of QOL and its association with depression among people with HIV in South India. The objectives of this study were to diagnose major depressive disorder (MDD) and examine the association of depression with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among people with HIV in coastal South India. Structured questionnaires detailing sociodemographic and HIV related variables were filled out by 103 patients with HIV attending a tertiary care center. Interviews were carried out by a psychiatrist to diagnose ICD-10 MDD and a clinical psychologist to rate the severity of depression using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Subjective HRQOL was assessed using HIV/AIDS targeted quality of life questionnaire in these patients. Fifty patients were diagnosed with MDD. Among them, 23 (46%) were mildly depressed, 19 (38%) were moderately depressed, 7 (14%) were severely depressed, and 1 (2%) was very severely depressed. Mean QOL scores for all dimensions except sexual function were significantly and inversely correlated (p<0.05) with HAMD implying that patients with greater severity of depressive symptoms had poorer HRQOL. Individuals with ICD-10 diagnosis of MDD presented significantly lower scores of QOL compared to individuals without MDD. The implication is that early diagnosis and referral of depressed patients needs to be incorporated into intervention programs to improve patient outcomes and QOL. More research is needed to investigate the impact of antidepressant therapy on QOL using this study as a comparison group in a similar population."

However, few studies have investigated the effects of host genetics on the occurrence of opportunistic infections among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. In the present study, the frequency of the interleukin (IL)-7Rα+1237 A/G single nucleotide polymorphisms was determined in relation to opportunistic infection occurrence among HIV and AIDS patients in the Vhembe District. Demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic status data were collected from patients using a structured questionnaire. Genomic DNA was extracted from mouthwash samples using the QIAmp Blood Mini Kit. Genotyping of the IL-7Rα+1237 gene was conducted using a sequence-specific polymerase chain reaction method. We found that the IL-7Rα+1237 genotype distribution in our study population differed from those in European populations with a predominance of the A/G genotype. Individuals carrying the A/G genotype primarily suffered from chest pain (χ(2) = 5.016, P = 0.025), while individuals carrying the G/G genotype were protected from chest pain but had a higher prevalence of sexually transmitted disease (23 vs 16.9%); however, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.435). Individuals carrying the A/A genotype were more susceptible to diarrhea (32 vs 13.6%) (P = 0.034). Our data will support gene therapy and may be used to modify the course of diseases among HIV patients as well as the general population. Further studies using larger populations are needed to confirm these hypotheses."

However, little is known about the pharmacokinetics and drug interactions between TVR and antiretrovirals in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with advanced liver fibrosis. Here we report the pharmacokinetics of TVR and antiretrovirals in a cohort of HIV/HCV genotype 1-coinfected patients with advanced liver fibrosis treated with TVR-based triple anti-HCV therapy. No significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir, amprenavir or tenofovir at baseline and at Day 15 of TVR, whereas the AUC0-4h of darunavir was 36% lower in the presence of TVR (AUC0-4h 15007ngh/mL and 9563ngh/mL at baseline and at Day 15 of TVR administration, respectively). Noteworthy, the AUC0-4h, Cmin and Cmax of raltegravir were reduced by 61%, 50% and 64%, respectively. However, none of the patient's plasma levels of tenofovir, atazanavir, amprenavir or raltegravir declined below their minimum effective concentrations even in association with TVR, and no HIV treatment failure occurred. A non-significant trend for lower TVR exposure was seen in patients concomitantly given amprenavir versus those given atazanavir (AUC0-4h, 9840ngh/mL and 13345ngh/mL, respectively). In conclusion, this study highlighted the feasibility of maintaining the current antiretroviral regimen in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, even when significant interactions with TVR are predictable, whenever a change of HIV PIs is not deemed appropriate.

2054,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Bone disorders such as osteopenia and osteoporosis have been recently reported in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but their etiology remains still unknown. The prevalence estimates vary widely among the different studies and can be affected by concomitant factors such as the overlapping of other possible conditions inducing bone loss as lypodystrophy, advanced HIV-disease, advanced age, low body weight or concomitant use of other drugs. All the reports at the moment available in the literature showed a higher than expected prevalence of reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV-infected subjects both naïve and receiving potent antiretroviral therapy compared to healthy controls. This controversial can suggest a double role played by both antiretroviral drugs and HIV itself due to immune activation and/or cytokines disregulation. An improved understanding of the pathogenesis of bone disorders can result in better preventative and therapeutic measures. However, the clinical relevance and the risk of fractures remains undefined in HIV-population. The clinical management of osteopenia and osteoporosis in HIV-infected subjects is still being evaluated. Addressing potential underlying bone disease risk factors (e.g., smoking and alcohol intake, use of corticosteroids, advanced age, low body weight), evaluating calcium and vitamin D intake, and performing dual x-ray absorptiometry in HIV-infected individuals who have risk factors for bone disease can be important strategies to prevent osteopenia and osteoporosis in this population. The administration of bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate), with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, may be a reasonable and effective option to treat osteoporosis in these subjects."

For those infected, social support is associated with improved medication adherence. Disclosure of infection status is likely a prerequisite for social support. However, little research describes patterns of HIV disclosure by infected persons. We retrospectively evaluated factors associated with disclosure among patients initiating HIV care at a university-based clinic from 2007 to 2012. Of 490 persons initiating care, 13 % had not disclosed their HIV infection to anyone. Black race significantly predicted non-disclosure and persons living with a significant other or friends were more likely to have disclosed their HIV infection versus those living alone. CD4 + T lymphocyte count <200 was associated with nondisclosure and disclosure only to family members. Future research is needed to better understand factors associated with disclosure of HIV infection status, because this could enhance receipt of social support and contribute to improved HIV health outcomes."

Data on 509 HIV-HCV co-infected patients, followed up at six French University Hospitals, were collected using a questionnaire. Student's t-test, Pearson's chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Fisher-Freeman-Halton's exact tests were used. The mean age of the patients was 38.3 years, and the male to female sex ratio 2.08; 88% of patients were born in Metropolitan France, and 20% were dependent on health benefits; 74% were intravenous drug users and 14% blood or blood product recipients. Forty-seven percent were in CDC classification stage A, 18% had a CD4+ count of <200, and 79% were undergoing current antiretroviral treatment. HCV RNA was positive in 84% (50% type 1, 13% untypable). Forty-four percent had normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, 24% alcohol consumption >15 g/day, and 51% had undergone liver biopsy (10% of which had cirrhosis). Histological grade was not related to ALT level or CD4+ count. Overall, 40% of patients had been treated for HCV infection. HCV treatment was significantly associated with performance of liver biopsy, histological grade, ALT level, CD4+ count, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) classification, but not with age or alcohol consumption. Rate of early response to treatment was fifty percent among patients treated with bitherapy. Eighty-nine percent of all patients with previous or current anti-HCV treatment had undergone liver biopsy. In conclusion, despite the difficulties in managing hepatitis C in HIV-infected patients, almost one-half of all patients in this study had received anti-HCV treatment."

Of the 59 patients currently in the NVS cohort, 45.8% have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, thereby presenting a unique opportunity to study immune activation and the interaction between HCV and HIV. NVS with chronic HCV infection had elevated levels of immune activation (CD38-positive HLA-DR-positive CD8 cells) compared to NVS without chronic HCV (P = 0.004). The increased levels of immune activation were not associated with sex, HLA B57 status, or injection drug use use. NVS patients with chronic HCV had lower mean CD4 cell counts, CD4 percentage, and CD4/CD8 ratios than NVS without chronic HCV infection (P = 0.038, P = 0.008, and P = 0.048, respectively). The difference in CD4 cell count appeared to occur early in HIV infection with no difference observed in CD4 slopes between groups. Among all NVS, there was a direct correlation between mean CD4 cell count, mean CD4 percentage, and mean CD4/CD8 ratio with percentage of CD38 HLA-DR CD8 cells (P = 0.0018; P = 0.0069; and P = 0.0014, respectively). This study suggests a relationship between HCV infection, immune activation, and CD4 cell counts in the NVS, with chronic HCV infection associated with lower CD4 cell counts and higher levels of immune activation. Further studies are needed to determine if successful HCV treatment lowers immune activation levels and/or increases CD4 cell counts in these patients."
15279,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Worldwide, the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) cause, respectively, 600,000 and 350,000 deaths each year. Viral hepatitis is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer, which in turn ranks as the third cause of cancer death worldwide. Within the WHO European region, approximately 14 million people are chronically infected with HBV, and nine million people are chronically infected with HCV. Lack of reliable epidemiological data on HBV and HCV is one of the biggest hurdles to advancing policy. Risk groups such as migrants and injecting drug users (IDU) tend to be under-represented in existing prevalence studies; thus, targeted surveillance is urgently needed to correctly estimate the burden of HBV and HCV. The most effective means of prevention against HBV is vaccination, and most European Union (EU) countries have universal vaccination programmes. For both HBV and HCV, screening of individuals who present a high risk of contracting the virus is critical given the asymptomatic, and thereby silent, nature of disease. Screening of migrants and IDUs has been shown to be effective and potentially cost-effective. There have been significant advances in the treatment of HCV and HBV in recent years, but health care professionals remain poorly aware of treatment options. Greater professional training is needed on the management of hepatitis including the treatment of liver cancer to encourage adherence to guidelines and offer patients the best possible outcomes. Viral hepatitis knows no borders. EU Member States, guided by the EU, need to work in a concerted manner to implement lasting, effective policies and programmes and make tackling viral hepatitis a public health priority."

Twenty-one non-adherent HIV-positive men obtaining primary care clinical services at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center were recruited by health care providers. Intervention participants were primarily African-Americans with histories of intravenous drug use. During a period of five months, participants were provided with monthly medication counselling and a weekly medication pill organizer. Participants were compared with 21 non-adherent matched controls receiving standard pharmacy care including review of medications. Intervention and control subjects were compared on several variables: medication refill timeliness, appointment attendance, hospitalizations and opportunistic infections. Medical information was obtained from hospital and pharmacy records at baseline and post-intervention. Pre- to post-intervention rates of adherence to medication refills and clinic appointments increased significantly among intervention participants. Relative to matched controls, intervention participants also significantly increased drop-in visits and showed fewer hospitalizations. Intervention participants also showed significant decreases in the number of opportunistic infections. Results suggest that exposure to medication counselling and behavioural interventions increase adherence, with associated reductions in negative clinical outcomes."

Participants completed an interview about their sexual and injecting risk behaviours and were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBV), hepatitis C antibody (HCV), HIV and syphilis, as well as genital chlamydia and gonorrhoea infections. Three-quarters of IDUs (74%) reported injecting drugs in the past one month although most did not share needles (92%) and the majority obtained sterile needles from pharmacists (87%). Estimated HBV, HCV, HIV, syphilis, gonorrhoea and chlamydia prevalences were 7.8%, 7.7%, 0.9%, 1.9%, 0.0%, and 3.7%, respectively. The burden of HIV is presently low among IDUs in Lagos. Changes in accessibility to sterile needles at pharmacists would likely have a deleterious effect on IDUs' health. HBV vaccination and HCV prevention programmes for IDUs are urgently needed."

Overall prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was 60% (58% in men, 66% in women; P=.026). Age at start of and duration of injection drug use were associated with HIV infection (P<.001). The rate of HIV infection in persons with short duration of drug use (<24 months) was higher among women (45%) than among men (21%) (P=.002). The prevalence of HIV infection among IDUs <21 years old at first use of injection drugs and among patients reporting <48 months of injection drug use was significantly lower in those who started injection drug use after 1992 (19% vs. 53% of IDUs; odds ratio, 4.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.80-10.85). Awareness of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, preventive measures, and substance abuse treatment have contributed to the stabilization of the HIV epidemic. The higher prevalence of HIV infection among women IDUs and among young IDUs who recently began injecting drugs emphasizes the need to target HIV-transmission risk reduction interventions early."

Altogether 150 IDUs were interviewed (121 structured interviews between 1999 and 2000 and 29 ethnographic interviews between 2003 and 2004). The majority of them injected heroin (52% and 79%) and many injected amphetamines (51% and 35%). One person tested positive for HIV. Two thirds (68%) shared injecting equipment (syringes, cookers and filters). Some participants said they shared syringes because they were not carrying them for fear of police harassment and that they reused filters as a backup drug supply. In multivariate analysis, sharing of injecting equipment was associated with higher perceived susceptibility to HIV/AIDS, lower self-efficacy for sterile equipment use, higher motivation to comply with peer pressure to use dirty injecting equipment and with having a criminal record. The high levels of injecting risk-behaviors found in this study are a cause for serious concern. Interventions for HIV-prevention need to address not only sharing syringes but also sharing and reusing of other injecting equipment and drug filters."

A cross-sectional study including 314 male drug users from eight detoxification centres was performed. Out of 314 subjects studied, 48 (15.2%) were intravenous drug users. Participants were interviewed and had blood samples taken and tested for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies. Positive samples were tested for the presence of HCV RNA. Genotyping was performed on HCV RNA-positive samples. The overall prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies was 6.4% (n = 20). Out of 20 anti-HCV antibody-positive subjects, 16 (80%) were also HCV RNA-positive. Genotype 1 predominated (75%), followed by 3a (25%). Subtype 1a was more common than 1b. HCV infection was more prevalent among intravenous drug users (33%) than non-injecting users (1.5%).

Patients were systematically included over a period of two weeks. Each patient was asked to indicate the name of a family member that could be interviewed by the research team. A total of 188 PLHIV (122 women) ranging in age from 19 to 55 years were questioned. Interviews were conducted in 66 families. Most PLHIV had received some formal education ranging from primary school to university. Over one third (36.4%) had known that they were seropositive for at least one year. Almost three-fourths (73.4%) were aware that HIV was transmissible to other people. The most frequently mentioned transmission hazards were handling contaminated articles (51.5%), unprotected sexual intercourse (46.4%), contact with blood (34.8%), and sharing personal toilet articles (11.6%). The most commonly mentioned preventive measures were abstinence from sex (27.1%), use condoms (28.7%), and protection from pointed or cutting objects (19.1%). According to responding family members, the most common protective measures against HIV transmission were observing hygiene measures (36.5%), discarding any fluids from the ill person in the toilet (26.5%), wearing gloves (25%), and protecting against handling contaminated objects (5.8%). These data suggest that programs aimed at educating PLHIV and their families on the risk of HIV transmission and preventive measure has had a positive impact on the quality of life."

Active surveillance for listeriosis was performed in LAC during most of the period from 1985 through 1992. Thirty-four (10%) of 351 nonperinatal cases of listeriosis reported in LAC from 1985 through 1992 were in HIV-infected persons, 25 of whom met the 1987 AIDS case definition. The incidence of listeriosis was 95.8 and 8.8 cases per 100,000 person-years among persons with AIDS and all HIV-infected persons, respectively, but only 1.0 case per 100,000 person-years in the total population.

LM serogroup 1/2b may have been more common among HIV-infected persons in LAC than among other persons with listeriosis because of differences in diet or sexual practices, or to chance alone. Persons with HIV-infection, especially those with AIDS, should be educated in avoiding foods at high risk of listerial contamination, such as soft cheeses, foods sold from delicatessen counters, and undercooked chicken."

It is unknown whether EBV replication also occurs in the Hodgkin's disease (HD) tissue of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Therefore, we studied paraffin-embedded lymph nodes from 13 cases of HIV-associated HD to determine the latent or replicative state of EBV infection. All patients were seropositive HIV-infected men; additional clinical information was available for 12 patients. The risk factor(s) for HIV infection were homosexuality (n = 7), intravenous drug abuse (n = 2), homosexuality and intravenous drug abuse (n = 1), sexual promiscuity (n = 1), or hemophilia (n = 1). Advanced clinical stage and B symptoms were common at the time of initial diagnosis of HD. The histological subtype of Hodgkin's disease was universally mixed cellularity, except for a single case classified as nodular sclerosis. Seven cases exhibited foci of relative lymphoid depletion. Five cases contained foci of necrosis. Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells and RS cell variants were positive for CD30/BerH2 and negative for CD45/LCA, CD45RO/UCHL1, and CD20/L26 in all cases. Tumor cells were positive for CD15/LeuM1 in seven cases. In all 13 cases, RS cells and RS cell variants were infected by latent EBV as shown by in situ hybridization to EBV-encoded ribonucleic acid (EBER1). In 12 of 13 cases neoplastic cells coexpressed EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). EBV replication was examined by two different methods: immunohistochemistry to identify EBV-encoded BZLF1 protein and in situ hybridization to detect EBV BHLF1 transcripts. No positivity in RS or RS cell variants was detected with either assay of EBV replication (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0% to 23%). The findings confirm that EBV is detected more frequently in HIV-associated HD when compared with immunocompetent patients with HD. The findings also suggest that EBV is tightly latent within RS and RS cell variants of HIV-associated HD. It appears that factors other than host immune status are important in maintaining EBV latency in HIV-associated HD."

A retrospective chart review of patients with HIV and AIDS undergoing esophagectomy at a rural referral hospital was done for the period of 2009-2014. Patient postoperative complications, outcomes, and follow-up data were charted. All procedures were done by a single lead surgeon. Nine patients met the study criteria, 7 of whom had esophageal cancer, and 2 with strictures. Four patients had received nutritional self-expanding metal stent preoperatively. The mean stent duration was 61 days. Three patients had been on antiretroviral therapy before surgery. Preoperative CD4 counts were available in 7 patients. Eight patients underwent a 3-field esophagectomy and 1 was unresectable. Seven of these patients had successful outcomes, with varying follow-up times. One patient died post procedure while in the hospital. Complications included stricture and anastomotic leak. Although HIV-positive patients face increased risk during surgical procedures, this status should not be a firm contraindication to surgery. Quality nutritional status, antiretroviral use, and overall CD4 count levels remain important parameters in considering surgical treatment for these patients. With careful patient evaluation and planning, esophagectomy in an HIV and AIDS setting is feasible with successful outcomes."

Liver disease associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) seems to be accelerated in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). On the other hand, the effect of HCV on HIV progression was controversial before the introduction of HAART. However, the last study to report changes in mortality due to liver failure was published in 1997, and the impact of HCV carriage on the survival of HIV-infected patients receiving HAART needs to be clarified. In this investigation, 492 patients who were prescribed antiretroviral drugs between April 1989 and September 2000 were included in the study cohort. The median duration of follow-up of the cohort was 1,392 days. HCV infection was present in 323 (68%). Mortality attributable to AIDS decreased from 4.5 to 1.8 per 100 persons per year. Mortality due to liver failure increased from 0.3 to 0.5 per 100 persons per year ( P<0.01). The survival of patients with and without HCV infection was similar ( P=0.8). Although liver failure is an increasing cause of death among HIV-infected patients receiving HAART, HCV infection has still no impact on the survival of HIV-infected patients."

However, little is known about health care professionals' willingness to discuss adherence with patients, nor what barriers, if any, may impede their adherence communication. The aims of the study were to examine physicians' beliefs regarding: (1) the efficacy of adherence communication, (2) the barriers which impede such communication, and (3) their roles and responsibilities regarding adherence communication. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 physicians who specialize in providing care to HIV-positive patients. Results showed that most physicians believed that communicating with patients about adherence issues was important, even though doing so may not have an immediate impact on patients' behaviors. Physicians believed that adherence communication was a good use of their time and fell within their role as a primary care professional. However, time constraints were cited as a barrier to performing adherence communication, indicating that physicians may do less communicating about adherence than may be optimal if they are burdened with other tasks. Results highlight the need to develop innovative strategies, such as the use of multi-disciplinary adherence teams, to ensure that each HIV-positive patient receives the optimal amount of information about and support for adherence."

We examined explanations, over a four-year period in a centralized HIV clinical cohort under universal health care, for newly diagnosed patients, while being fully engaged and retained in HIV care, delaying ART initiation for >180 days following their HIV diagnosis. All patients followed at the Southern Alberta Clinic, Calgary, Canada between 1 January 2010 and 1 January 2014 were included and followed until they moved, were lost to follow-up, died or until 1 January 2015. Of 269 patients, 56 (21.8%) deferred ART >180 days; 26 (9.7%) remained ART naïve until the end of the study. Patients delaying or deferring ART were younger, Canadian-born, and with higher CD4 counts (p < .01). ""No clinical urgency"" especially for patients with higher CD4 counts, was most often listed for deferring ART, however when ART was offered ""patient not ready"", ""unstable substance use"", ""difficulties adjusting"" or ""wanting to wait"" were often cited regardless of CD4 levels. At times ART, when offered, was adamantly declined by the patient. The physician's assessment of a patient's ability to adhere to lifelong ART was an issue in some cases. While structural or financial issues may impact ART initiation, our results suggest that, even in an environment of free and easy access to ART, many challenges still exist at the implementation stage. Intense efforts in both patient and physician education will be required if the benefits of early ART as recommended by the WHO in their recent guidelines, are to be achieved at the individual and population level."

The purpose of this study was, therefore, to identify, evaluate, and summarize what research has been conducted to examine patient perceptions of their health-information needs among adults living with HIV in LAC. Using an integrative review methodology, a literature search of six databases was conducted in April and May 2015. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed articles published in English or Spanish that assessed the information needs of HIV-positive patients living in LAC. The quality of included articles was assessed and relevant characteristics of each article were extracted, compared, and presented. Searches returned 1885 citations, 11 of which met inclusion criteria. Studies included were conducted in 8 of 33 countries, used multiple research designs, demonstrated varying needs between populations, and found numerous unmet information needs. Information about HIV in general, methods of infection transmission, antiretroviral medications, other sexually transmitted diseases, and effective coping mechanisms were the most commonly mentioned needs. Healthcare providers were the largest and most reliable source of health information for many participants and it was emphasized that in order for health education to be effective, programs should include both individual and group components. Patients indicated that they may have difficulty processing and using information through an incorrect understanding of medications, not changing risk behaviors, and by stating that information can be overwhelming or poorly communicated. Further research on information needs is warranted so that healthcare providers and organizations may provide the information patients need to appropriately manage their health."

4675,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus disease has presented the medical professional with many challenges over the past 10 years. In the decade ahead, one aspect of working in the field that is certainly becoming an increasingly formidable issue will be dealing with AIDS-related burnout among health care professionals. The risks of AIDS-related burnout are multiple. If providers cannot find effective strategies for coping, it is possible that some of the most sensitive and compassionate workers in the field may leave to seek less stressful career opportunities. Those who focus on the negative impact that HIV disease has had on society will react with increased finger pointing to the risk of burning out as another negative consequence of working with HIV infection. Individual burnout will ultimately impact on the organization requiring interventions at that level as well. Setting up mechanisms for both individuals and organizational systems to combat AIDS-related burnout will, in the short run, add to increased costs of care in a disease already noted for its high treatment expense. However, intervening to prevent AIDS-related burnout will ultimately be cost effective by minimizing its negative effects on individuals and institutions. Learning how to cope with AIDS-related burnout may benefit the medical professional caring for patients with HIV disease as well as the profession as a whole. Facilitation of communication among individuals will certainly be fostered. Already we have seen a reorganization of delivery of health care that encourages the emphasis on integration of the patient into a true partnership with their provider. Becoming aware of the problem of AIDS-related burnout and attempting to prevent it can only serve to foster greater humanism in service professionals. A report of the National Academy of Science Committee for the oversight of AIDS activities recommended in 1988 that ""research funding be made available to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of programs to alleviate stress in health care workers who care for AIDS patients."" Such funding is long overdue and should be made available immediately. As we enter the second decade of facing the complex challenges of the HIV epidemic, the stress could potentially become overwhelming. Dysfunctional health care providers need not become part of the problem. Now is the time to find solutions."

Controls (167) consisted of identically followed patients who had not been exposed to an HBs Ag-positive health worker. No exposed or control patient acquired clinical hepatitis or HBs Ag. Isolated elevations in serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase occurred equally in both groups and did not correlate with serologic evidence for hepatitis B infection. One exposed patient demonstrated antibody seroconversion (anti-HBs), as did two of the controls. These data do not demonstrate hepatitis B transmission from HBs Ag-positive health workers to their patients. Restriction of such carriers is not warranted at present."

We evaluated 41 patients with HBV-related PAN to determine the circumstances leading to infection, the clinical features of vasculitis, the prognostic factors, and the response to therapy. Most patients were first treated briefly with corticosteroids, and all were included in 2 nonrandomized prospective therapeutic trials of an antiviral agent (35 patients with vidarabine, 6 patients with interferon-alpha 2b) and plasma exchanges. The mean duration of follow-up was 69.6 +/- 44.8 months. At the end of the study, 21 (51.2%) patients had seroconverted to anti-HBeAb and 10 (24.4%) also had seroconverted to anti-HBsAb. In all, 23 (56%) patients no longer expressed serologic evidence of HBV replication. All 33 (80.5%) patients still alive at the end of follow-up recovered from PAN. Nineteen also recovered from HBV infection and were considered to be cured; 13 patients had persistent HBV infection and were considered to be in clinical recovery; and 1 patient was in remission, maintained with steroid therapy. Eight patients died during the study period; 3 deaths were directly attributable to PAN. HBV-related PAN is an acute disease, occurring shortly after infection and sharing the characteristics of classic PAN. It is not an antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA)-mediated vasculitis. The outcome was good for patients treated with short-term steroid therapy, antiviral agents, and plasma exchanges. We propose this protocol as the first treatment for HBV-related PAN, because it surpasses the conventional treatment with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, which facilitates viral replication and the development of chronic HBV infection."

The overall risk among patients with current or prior HBV infection in the context of DAA treatment is unknown. The aim of this evaluation was to identify and characterize HBV reactivation among veterans treated with oral DAA therapy. This retrospective evaluation included 62,290 hepatitis C virus-infected veterans completing oral DAA treatment. Baseline HBV infection status for each veteran was identified from HBV laboratory data performed prior to DAA initiation. To assess for HBV reactivation and hepatitis we identified all hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HBV DNA, and alanine aminotransferase results obtained while on DAA treatment or 7 days after. HBV reactivation was defined as a >1000 IU/mL increase in HBV DNA or HBsAg detection in a person who was previously negative. Prior to DAA treatment 85.5% (53,784/62,920) had HBsAg testing and 0.70% (377/53,784) were positive; 84.6% (53,237/62,920) had a hepatitis B surface antibody test, of which 42.2% (22,479/53,237) were positive. In all, 9 of 62,290 patients treated with DAAs had evidence of HBV reactivation occurring while on DAA treatment. Eight occurred in patients known to be HBsAg-positive, and 1 occurred in a patient known to be isolated hepatitis B core antibody-positive. Seventeen other patients had small increases in HBV DNA levels that did not qualify as HBV reactivation.

Three levels of evidence were defined according to the data source: randomized studies (level A), cohort or case-control studies (level B), and expert opinion (level C). The decision to recommend, consider or not to recommend antiretroviral treatment (ART) was established by consensus in each situation. The current treatment of choice for HIV infection is the combination of three drugs. Combined ART is recommended in patients with symptomatic HIV infection, and guidelines on this treatment in patients with an opportunistic type C infection are included. In asymptomatic patients, initiation of ART is recommended on the basis of CD4 lymphocyte counts, plasma viral load and patient co-morbidities, as follows: a) therapy should be started in patients with CD4 counts <350 cells/μL; b) Therapy should be recommended when CD4 counts are between 350 and 500 cells/μL, except when CD4 are stabilized, there is low plasma viral load, or the patient not willing; c) Therapy could be deferred when CD4 counts are above 500 cells/ μL, but should be considered in cases of cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis C, hepatitis B fulfilling treatment criteria, high cardiovascular risk, HIV nephropathy, viral load > 100,000 copies/ mL, proportion of CD4 cells < 14%, in people aged >55 years, and in cases of discordant serological sexual couples in order to reduce transmission. cART should include 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitor nucleoside analogues (AN) and a non-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NN) or 2 AN and a ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor (PI/ r), but other combinations are possible. The panel has consensually selected and prioritized some drug combinations, some of them co-formulated. The objective of cART is to achieve an undetectable viral load. Adherence to therapy plays an essential role in maintaining antiviral response. Therapeutic options are limited after cART failures, but undetectable viral load maybe possible with resistance genotypic studies. Adverse events are a decreasing problem of cART, where the benefits exceed the possible harm. cART in acute HIV infection, in women, pregnancy and prevention of mother to child transmission, and pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis are commented on. Management of hepatitis B or C co-infection is also commented on."

Herein we describe a rare case of PBL that spontaneously regressed. An 80-year-old man was referred to our hospital owing to an exophytic gingival tumor in the right maxillary second molar region. He had no significant past medical history, and a screening test for HIV was negative. Imaging showed that the tumor measured 26 × 23 × 16 mm and was confined in the alveolar bone. The tumor was histologically comprised of highly proliferative immunoblastic cells positive for CD138 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded RNA. Monoclonal IgH chain gene rearrangement was detected via polymerase chain reaction. After biopsy and diagnosis of PBL, the tumor began to decrease in size and had apparently disappeared at the time of surgery. There was no histological evidence of a residual lesion in the surgical specimen. In conclusion, a minority of immunosenescence-associated PBLs in the elderly should be recognized as a unique clinicopathological entity distinct from common aggressive PBL. "
9731,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"This review summarizes the data on the anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity associated with saliva and the possible routes of oral transmission of HIV. Saliva can be passed from an HIV-infected individual to an uninfected person via sexual or non-sexual activities. The relative risk of HIV transmission through saliva is a subject of continuing concern for dental practitioners. HIV-infected individuals frequently have oral lesions that can cause bleeding and release of the virus into the oral cavity. In addition, viral p24 and HIV-1 RNA were detected in tonsils and adenoids even in asymptomatic seropositive individuals. Nevertheless, the potential HIV-infectivity of saliva is low, although both infectious HIV-1 and HIV DNA have been detected in saliva. This observation has led to the suggestion that saliva may contain factors that inhibit HIV-1 infectivity. At least two anti-HIV activities have been partially characterized: (i) physical entrapment of HIV by high-molecular-weight molecules (e.g., mucins), and (ii) inhibition of viral infection by soluble proteins. Several studies have indicated that, of the salivary proteins evaluated, recombinant secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (rSLPI) could inhibit HIV-1 infection in macrophages at physiological concentrations. The anti-HIV activity of the serine protease inhibitor rSLPI is most likely due to its interaction with a cell-surface molecule(s) other than the primary HIV-1 receptor, CD4, and may involve (i) inhibition of cell-surface serine protease(s), and/or (ii) interaction with other human-specific co-factors essential for viral entry."

HIV-1 nucleic acid and beta-chemokines were found in all patient blood samples and in more than half of the cervical samples regardless of CCR5 or CCR2B genotype. High beta-chemokine concentrations were in general associated with high virus loads in blood and cervix. In the blood, the proviral DNA load was significantly correlated with the MIP-1alpha concentration, whereas the DNA load in cervix was significantly associated with the MIP-1beta concentration. The cervical viral RNA load was significantly associated with levels of all three chemokines.

The HRQOL and SS of a participant were assessed by using Quality of Life Index (QL-Index) and Social Relationship Scale (SRS), respectively. The QL-Index, SRS quality (SRS-Q), and SRS extent of network (SRS-EN) scores were rated at baseline (week 0), week 12, and week 24. The significant differences of QL-Index, SRS-Q, and SRS-EN scores obtained at three points of time were initially analyzed by using a repeated measure multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). For those significantly different scores, a paired t test was applied to determine the significant difference of a pair of scores. Sixty-nine healthy individuals who had never had HIV tests participated in this study. Of these, 37 were HIV-seropositive. The HRQOL and SS of 37, 30, and 27 HIV-seropositive participants were evaluated at week 0, at week 12, and week 24, respectively. No significant difference was found among QL-Index scores and among SRS-Q scores obtained at those three points of time. However, SRS-EN scores obtained at week 24 were significantly higher than those obtained at week 0 and at week 12. In conclusion, an HIV-seropositive result by itself does not have much impact on a healthy HIV patient's HRQOL and SS. In contrast, his or her SS seems to be widened over time."

Subjects were randomized to receive either HIV type 1 (HIV-1) immunogen (Remune; inactivated HIV-1 from which gp120 is depleted in incomplete Freund's adjuvant or adjuvant control at 0, 12, 24, and 36 weeks at five different clinical sites in Thailand. Neither group received antiviral drug therapy. The a priori primary endpoint for the trial was changes in CD4-cell counts with secondary parameters of percent changes in CD8-cell counts (percent CD4, CD8, and CD4/CD8) and body weight. Subsets of subjects were also examined for changes in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, Western blot immunoreactivity, and HIV-1 delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test reactivity. There was a significant difference in changes in CD4-cell counts that favored the HIV-1 immunogen-treated group compared to those for the adjuvant-treated control group (P<0.05). On average, for HIV-1 immunogen-treated subjects CD4-cell counts increased by 84 cells by week 40, whereas the increase for the control group was 38 cells by week 40. This increase in CD4-cell count was associated with increased HIV-specific immunogenicity, as shown by Western blotting and enhanced HIV-1 DTH skin reactivity. No significant differences in adverse events were observed between the groups. The results of this trial suggest that HIV-1 immunogen is safe and significantly increases CD4-cell counts and HIV-specific immunity compared to those achieved with the adjuvant control in asymptomatic HIV-1-infected subjects not taking antiviral drugs."

Ten human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals were included and IL-2 was administered subcutaneously with 3 x 106 IU three times a week for 24 weeks. Mean TRF length was decreased on average by 267 bp at week 4 (P = 0.03) and 286 bp at week 8 (P = 0.09). Individual TRF changes at weeks 12, 16, 20 and 24 were highly variable. However, in the 12 weeks following therapy, TRF lengths generally increased reaching baseline levels by the end of the study. At baseline, mean TRF lengths were positively correlated to the ratio of naïve and memory phenotype within both CD4+ and CD8+ cells. This study shows that IL-2 treatment induces transient shortened mean TRF lengths in PBMC from HIV-infected individuals, indicating that IL-2 enhances the lymphocyte count by peripheral proliferation or recruitment of memory T cells into the blood."

We present a clinical case with a probable cause and effect association between these two entities. A 71-year-old woman developed an erythematous exanthem with pruritic and scaly lesions located at the torso and upper limbs associated with heliotrope and Gottron's papules. At the same time, she notice a significant loss of muscular strength. Skin and muscular biopsies made the diagnosis of dermatomyositis and the patient started with prednisolone (60 mg/day) with poor symptoms control. Paraneoplastic syndrome, HIV, hepatitis B virus and syphilis infections were excluded. HCV serology was positive, with a viral load of 58 159 IU/mL (genotype 1a). Therefore, the patient underwent a 12-week treatment with grazoprevir 100 mg and elbasvir 50 mg achieving a sustained virological response with regression of skin lesions and complete recovery of muscular strength (photodocumented before/after treatment).

When a surgeon is discovered to have HIV infection, a decision must be made about notification of patients, but only limited data are available to guide decision-making. Such notifications generally are decided upon on a case-by-case basis, taking into account such factors as the nature of the procedures performed, the infection-control knowledge and practices of the infected surgeon, the presumed likelihood of transmission, and available resources. This report describes the case of a cardiothoracic surgeon in Israel specializing in open-heart procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting and valve surgery) who was found to be HIV positive in January 2007 during evaluation for fever of recent onset. The duration of infection was unknown. A lookback investigation of patients operated on by the infected surgeon during the preceding 10 years was conducted under the auspices of the Israel Ministry of Health to determine whether any surgeon-to-patient HIV transmission had occurred. Of 1,669 patients identified, 545 (33%) underwent serologic testing for HIV antibody. All results were negative. A Ministry-appointed panel of experts delineated conditions under which the surgeon could resume work. The results of this investigation add to previously published data indicating a low risk for provider-to-patient HIV transmission."

Ten patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or related disorders, five of whom could not tolerate conventional doses of AZT, were administered rGM-CSF subcutaneously for 12 days. They then were administered an alternating regimen using AZT for 1 week, followed by 5 days of subcutaneous rGM-CSF and 2 days without any medication. During the initial 12 days of GM-CSF administration, there was an increase in the mean white blood cell (WBC) value. In addition, rGM-CSF stimulated circulating monocytes as evidenced by an increase in superoxide anion production and expression of surface HLA-DR antigen. However, at the same time rGM-CSF increased the serum HIV p24 antigen in each of the six evaluable patients from 189 x/divided by 2.02 pg/mL (geometric mean x/divided by SEM) at entry to 375 x/divided by 2.11 pg/mL (P less than .05). During the subsequent period of alternating AZT and rGM-CSF treatment, serum HIV p24 antigen fell below the day 14 value in most patients, particularly after the weeks of AZT administration. The mean T4 cell value increased in patients who had not previously received AZT, but generally did not change in those who had prior AZT exposure. Hematologic toxicity appeared to be somewhat reduced compared with continuous full-dose AZT therapy, and two patients with previous AZT hematologic toxicity tolerated this alternating regimen for 25 weeks. Additional regimens simultaneously combining these two agents are worth exploring."

All subjects gave a blood sample and completed a questionnaire on demographic and risk behaviour data. The prevalence of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV were 2.2% and 1.3% respectively. The prevalence of anti-HCV increased with age, rising gradually after age 30 years, in contrast to a stable prevalence of HBsAg in all age groups 10+ years. Age-adjusted risk factors for HCV infection were previous hospitalization, surgical operations, previous blood transfusions and intravenous drug use; for HBV infection only family exposure or contact with HBV case were identified."

Patients were divided in two groups, one composed of 33 individuals who needed AZT therapy and the other of those who did not need that medication (18 patients). Between 3 and 18 months several parameters were assessed on 3 different occasions, according to standard techniques: red blood cells and platelet numeration, CD4 and CD8 cell counts, HIV antigen (p24 Ag), beta 2-microglobulin, high density serum lipoproteins (HDL), and anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA). In the patients treated with AZT the first bioserologic evaluation was performed before starting this therapy. Finally it was observed that p24 AG and ACA were present in 21% of the patients, all of them in advanced stages of HIV infection and under AZT therapy.

The virus burden in the peripheral blood was estimated from the level of: plasma HIV p24 antigenemia; plasma viremia; p24 antigen in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) lysates as indicators of productive infection; and frequency of latently infected cells. Negligible HIV levels were observed in the plasma and PBMC lysates of the majority of samples except for late-stage patients with certain opportunistic infections and/or lack of zidovudine (AZT) therapy. Some individuals on AZT therapy and at late-stage of disease may show antigenemia without plasma viremia or alternatively, plasma viremia may be observed without plasma antigenemia. PBMC lysate data indicated that the frequency of productively infected cells was less than one in 20,000 PBMCs for the majority of samples irrespective of status on AZT therapy or disease stage. HIV was detected in greater than 95% of the cocultures and within 14 days for most of the samples, again regardless of the stage of disease or status on AZT therapy. The frequency of latently infected cells in this cohort ranged from 125 to 3125 per million PBMCs and was calculated to be as high as 2.5% of the helpter T-cell (CD4+ cell) population in the peripheral blood. The average latently infected cell frequency was 2-3-fold higher in early stage patients not on AZT than in late-stage patients on AZT therapy."

To explain the predominance of non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) over syncytium-inducing (SI) strains during the initial viremia of HIV, we investigated the ability of blood monocyte (Mo)-derived DC to transmit HIV-1 to CD4(+) cells of the monocytoid lineage. First, we demonstrate that in our system, DC are able to transmit NSI strains, but not SI strains, of HIV-1 to fresh blood Mo and to Mo-derived macrophages (MDM). To establish a productive infection, a 10-fold-lower amount of virus was necessary for DC-mediated transmission of HIV-1 to Mo than in case of cell-free infection. Second, immature CD83(-) DC (imDC) transmit virus to Mo and MDM with higher efficacy compared to mature CD83(+) DC (maDC); this finding is in contrast to data previously obtained with CD4(+) T cells. Third, maturation from imDC to maDC efficiently silenced expression of beta2-integrins CD11b, CD11c, and CD18 by maDC. Moreover, monoclonal antibody against CD18 inhibited transmission of HIV-1 from imDC to Mo. We propose that the adhesion molecules of the CD11/CD18 family, involved in cell-cell interactions of DC with the microenvironment, may play a major role in imDC-mediated HIV-1 infection of Mo and MDM."

The safety of lamivudine use in pregnant women infected with hepatitis B virus has not yet been proven. In this case, the patient became pregnant during the treatment with lamivudine and when hepatitis B virus replication markers were present in the serum (hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis Be antigen, hepatitis B virus DNA).

This article reviews the authors' experience with 101 patients with AIDS (73) or ARC (28) treated with AZT at a public hospital clinic in Los Angeles County. The patients were seen at least monthly for five to 87 weeks (means = 27.6) by nurse practitioners and physicians. Initiation of AZT therapy required a CDC-defined diagnosis of AIDS or an absolute CD4 lymphocyte cell count of 200/mm3 or less. The demographic distribution of the patient population was as follows: Caucasian, 59; Hispanic, 22; and black, 20. The mean age of the population was 37.4 years, and the predominant risk factor was homosexual contact (76 percent). Forty-one patients required modification of their AZT doses secondary to anemia, neutropenia, a combination of anemia and neutropenia, or for personal reasons. Thirty-four of the 41 patients (83 percent) never returned to full dose after reductions. The majority of these patients (81 percent) had AIDS and/or CD4 lymphocyte counts less than 150/mm3. Hematologic toxicity was common; 27 percent required blood transfusions. Of the 101 patients followed from five to 87 weeks, 87 percent were surviving after a mean of 45 weeks of AZT therapy. The article underscores the effectiveness of AZT in prolonging the lives of AIDS and ARC patients."

MTCT of HIV-1 varies widely and is dependent on obstetric practices, mode of delivery, breastfeeding, and the level of the viral load in the mother. Antiretroviral therapy (ARV) in pregnancy is prescribed for two main reasons: (i) women who need ARV medication for their own health; (ii) women who do not need treatment, or do not have access to treatment are offered prophylaxis to prevent MTCT, using one of a number of ARV regimens known to be effective.

At the end of 2008, approximately 20% of the persons living with HIV had an undiagnosed infection. Of those living with HIV at the end of 2008, nearly two thirds were racial/ethnic minorities and half were men who have sex with men (MSM). In 2007, HIV ranked fifth as a leading cause of death among persons aged 35-44 years in the United States but third among blacks or African Americans in this age group. In 40 states with longstanding confidential name-based HIV surveillance systems, 33% of the estimated 41,768 adults and adolescents diagnosed with HIV infection in 2008 developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) within 1 year and, of these, 44% received their initial diagnosis in an acute care setting, suggesting that they received HIV testing late in the course of the infection. HIV-infected persons who are unaware of their infection or who receive a late diagnosis cannot benefit fully from timely initiation of therapy and are more likely to experience HIV-related morbidity and premature mortality. In addition, persons unaware of their infection are more likely to transmit HIV to others because of a higher prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviors and higher levels of viral RNA that continue to replicate without appropriate antiretroviral treatment."

We used 262 electronic monitors to measure adherence with all antiretrovirals in 85 HIV-infected current and former drug users, and found that active cocaine use, female gender, not receiving Social Security benefits, not being married, screening positive for depression, and the tendency to use alcohol or drugs to cope with stress were all significantly associated with poor adherence. The strongest predictor of poor adherence and, in turn, failure to maintain viral suppression, was active cocaine use. Overall adherence among active cocaine users was 27%, compared to 68% among subjects who reported no cocaine use during the 6-month study period. Consequently, 13% of active cocaine users maintained viral suppression, compared to 46% of nonusers. Interventions to improve adherence should focus on reducing cocaine use, developing adaptive coping skills, and identifying and treating depression."

Key informants were selected purposively from organizations active in HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome) work throughout PNG. Interviews were taped, transcribed and analyzed thematically. Predicted barriers likely to impede the delivery of ART by the health services included shortages of skilled and experienced personnel; lack of sustainable funding; weak services at the rural periphery; lack of capacity for the management of chronic illness; inadequacies of basic services for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs); the difficulty of finding the most appropriate method and venue of delivery for ART; and the complexities of establishing social criteria for deciding who to treat. Barriers likely to impede the acceptance of treatment by the community included the cost of treatment to the patient; the low socioeconomic status of PLWHAs; the effects of stigma, particularly in the case of women; and sociocultural factors affecting public perceptions of ART. The study concluded that, given the range of potential barriers, scaling up ART in PNG and other developing countries will be a complex process, requiring careful decisions to be made over how best to utilize available resources."

A standard data collection form was used to identify patients observed in 7 days in November 2004. Three hundred and eighty patients with the following characteristics were included: male gender 71%; mean age 41.5 years; HIV diagnosed 12 years ago; routes of transmission via injection drug use (78%); undetectable HIV viral load (235/373, 63%) or <10 000 copies/mL (86/373, 23%). HCV RNA was positive in 325 of 369 (88%) patients; HCV genotype was 1 or 4 in 65% and liver biopsy had been carried out in 56%. There were several explanations for the nontreatment of HCV in 205 of the 380 (54%) patients, with 2.4 reasons per patient: anti-HCV treatment was deemed questionable (n = 109) because of minor hepatic lesions, alcohol consumption, or active drug use; no liver biopsy had been performed (n = 68); treatment was contraindicated (n = 62), mainly for psychiatric reasons; there was physician conviction of poor patient compliance (n = 62) and patient refusal (n = 33). Patients having received anti-HCV treatment (n = 91) compared with those who had never received any (n = 205) were more commonly of European origin, had better control of their HIV infection, were followed by a hepatologist more often, had a liver biopsy more often and had more commonly a high HCV viral load (P < 0.001). In 'real life' in France in 2004, more than half of the HIV-HCV coinfected patients have never received anti-HCV treatment. The main reasons are a treatment that may be deemed questionable (minimal hepatic lesions, alcohol, active drug use), a lack of available liver biopsy, a psychiatric contraindication and physician conviction of poor patient compliance."

Yet the potential interaction between the two factors on adherence has not been examined. For this study we collected longitudinal data on HIV medication adherence among PLWH in Atlanta, GA, to assess a possible synergistic effect between the two factors on HIV medication adherence. People informed about the study came to the research site and completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview and instructions for pill counting. Over the next 5 weeks participants received three unscheduled follow-up phone assessments conducted 2 weeks apart to collect pill counts of their HIV medication. The prevalence of food insecurity was 60 % (488) and that of drug use was 33 % (274) in the sample of 809 participants. Among 770 participants who completed follow-up phone assessments, both food insecurity and drug use were associated with HIV medication adherence after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics. The negative association between drug use and adherence persisted after further adjusting for health-related characteristics. Moreover, drug use appeared to moderate the effect of food insufficiency on adherence, with drug users who were food insufficient being the least likely to achieve 85 % adherence. Results from the current study demonstrate a synergism between food insecurity and drug use that may impede adherence among PLWH. The findings imply that the disruptive effects of food insecurity and drug use on adherence are likely to be intensified with the presence of each other, and encourage interventions to address the problem of HIV medication adherence from a multi-faceted perspective that takes into account detrimental combination of problem factors."

The major challenge was the need to integrate resistance testing, pharmacokinetic data, medication adherence, toxicity data, clinical assessments, randomization assignment, and protocol-specified clinical management in a way that could be utilized in real time by the protocol team, communicated promptly to the clinical sites, and transmitted accurately to the study database. In addition, the protocol team had to address the relative lack of commercially available TDM laboratories in the United States that were experienced in antiretroviral drug assays and a lack of familiarity with the principles of pharmacokinetic monitoring at participating clinical sites.

The introduction of buprenorphine maintenance therapy into HIV care settings provides an opportunity for providers to integrate treatment for opiate dependence into their practices. Buprenorphine maintenance therapy has been associated with reductions in opiate use, increased social stability, improved adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and lowered rates of injection drug use. We describe the following 4 models for the integration of buprenorphine maintenance therapy into HIV care: (1) a primary care model, in which the highly active antiretroviral therapy-administering clinician also prescribes buprenorphine; (2) a model that relies on an on-site specialist in addiction medicine or psychiatry to prescribe the buprenorphine; (3) a hybrid model, in which an on-site specialist provides the induction (with or without stabilization phases) and the HIV care provider provides the maintenance phase; and (4) a drug treatment model that provides buprenorphine maintenance therapy services with HIV services in the substance abuse clinic setting. The key barriers against effective integration of buprenorphine maintenance therapy and primary HIV services are discussed, and we suggest several mechanisms to overcome such obstacles."

Opiate agonist therapy has been shown to diminish and often eliminate opiate use. This behavior change has resulted in the reduced transmission of many infections, including HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and an enhanced quality of life. For the past 35 years, the provision of opioid agonist therapy has been limited to opioid treatment programmes. Opioid treatment programmes treat approximately 200,000 of the estimated million opiate-addicted individuals in the United States. With the need to increase the number of treatment opportunities available for opioid-dependent patients, Congress passed the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000, which allows for the treatment of opioid dependence using buprenorphine by a properly licensed physician, including HIV primary care physicians. The integration of buprenorphine treatment for opioid addiction into HIV primary care thus provides a new treatment paradigm to address substance abuse in patients with HIV and HCV infections."

Therefore, we reviewed the literature to explore how FI may impact ART adherence, retention in medical care, and adherence to health care recommendations among PLHIV. We found data to support FI as a critical barrier to adherence to ART and to other health care recommendations among HIV-infected adults, HIV-infected pregnant women and their HIV-exposed infants, and child and adolescent populations of PLHIV. Associations between FI and ART non-adherence were seen in qualitative and quantitative studies. We identified a number of mechanisms to explain how food insecurity and ART non-adherence may be causally linked, including the exacerbation of hunger or ART side effects in the absence of adequate food and competing resource demands. Interventions that address FI may improve adherence to care and treatment recommendations for PLHIV. "

These two infection interact on each other, worsening the prognosis and increasing mortality. The diagnosis of tuberculosis is sometimes difficult to establish since the clinical presentation may be incomplete, but must always be evoked and sought whenever there is the slightest doubt. These patients should be given conventional anti-tuberculosis treatment using three or four anti-tuberculosis drugs for a duration of 9 months. Overall outcome is favorable. Drug interactions between antiretroviral drugs and anti-tuberculosis drugs is a real problem, limiting the use of certain agents. The restored immunization achieved with HAART protocols involve ""paradoxical"" reactions which complicate patient adherence to therapy.

It has been considered that persistent innate and acquired immune activation contributes to the pathogenesis of these non-AIDS related diseases. Immune activation has been related with several conditions, remarkably with the bacterial translocation related with the intestinal barrier damage by the HIV or by hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver cirrhosis. Consequently, increased morbidity and mortality must be expected in HIV-HCV coinfected patients. Disrupted gut barrier lead to an increased passage of microbial products and to an activation of the mucosal immune system and secretion of inflammatory mediators, which in turn might increase barrier dysfunction. In the present review, the intestinal barrier structure, measures of intestinal barrier dysfunction and the modifications of them in HIV monoinfection and in HIV-HCV coinfection will be considered. Both pathogenesis and the consequences for the progression of liver disease secondary to gut microbial fragment leakage and immune activation will be assessed. "

Clinical and virologic assessment was performed every 4 weeks during the treatment and at posttreatment weeks 4 and 12. All patients achieved a sustained virologic response at posttreatment week 12. 80% of patients reported at least one adverse event: fatigue and anemia of mild intensity were the most common; a single episode of moderate liver decompensation was observed. The paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir/dasabuvir antiviral regimen is effective and well tolerated in genotype 1 or 4 hepatitis C virus-infected patients on hemodialysis therapy with compensated cirrhosis and/or failure of previous treatments."

A athologist unaware of the patients' condition graded liver fibrosis and necroinflammation (Ishak) and steatosis (Kleiner). Patients were tested for PNPLA3 variants and genotyped for the PNPLA3 rs738409 C to G variant underlying the I148M substitution. All were hepatitis B surface antigen negative and stated no alcohol abuse. The mean age was 40.6 (37.6-44.1) years, 72.6% were males, 42% had HCV genotype 3, 38.9% HCV genotype 1 and 79.2% were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. The 79 patients with the PNPLA3 p.148I/M or M/M variants more frequently showed severe steatosis (score 3-4) than the 89 with PNPLA3 p.148I/I (43% vs. 24.7%, p 0.001), whereas no difference was observed in the degree of necroinflammation or fibrosis. Compared with 112 patients with lower scores, 56 with severe steatosis showed higher body mass index (p 0.03), higher rate of HCV genotype 3 (55.6% vs. 35.2%, p 0.01), PNPLA3 p.148I/M or M/M (60.7% vs. 39.3%, p 0.01) and lower CD4(+) cells/mm(3) (514.00 (390.5-673.0) vs. 500.00 (399.0-627.0); p 0.002). At multivariate analysis, body mass index (p 0.01), HCV genotype 3 (p 0.006), CD4(+) cell count (p 0.005) and PNPLA3 p.148I/M or M/M variants (p 0.01) were found to be independent predictors of severe liver steatosis. The PNPLA3 p.148 I/M or M/M variants and CD4(+) cell count were the only independent predictors of severe steatosis in patients with HCV non-3 genotypes. This is the first study to show that among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients the PNPLA3 p.148I/M or M/M variant have substantially less impact on steatosis for those with HCV genotype 3 than non-genotype 3.

In another experiment, the effects of niridazole on the immune competence and the tumor incidence in chickens congenitally infected with RAV-1 were studied. Lymphocyte stimulation by phytohemagglutinin, the phytohemagglutinin skin test, the response to immunization with sheep erythrocytes and Brucella abortus, and histological evaluation of lymphoid organs were used to determine the immune competence in normal and infected chickens. Results indicated that both B- and T-cell immune functions during the early and late stages of RAV-1 infection were comparable to those of normal uninfected chickens. Administration of niridazole to congenitally infected chickens at 5 weeks of age for 7 or 21 days had no effect on the T-cell-mediated immunity; however, administration of the drug for 21 days eliminated lymphoma development. Unlike infection with other oncogenic viruses such as those causing Marek's disease and reticuloendotheliosis, infection with RAV-1 caused no detectable immunodepression during the early and late stages of infection."

The objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare the concentrations of vitamin A and beta-carotene, micronutrients related to immunity and oxidative stress, in 182 adults with HIV/AIDS, under different highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their HAART regimen: combination of nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-NRTIs; combination of NRTIs, protease inhibitors, and ritonavir; combination of NRTIs and other classes. Multiple linear regression analysis determined the effect of the treatment regimen, time of use, and compliance with the regimen, on vitamin A and beta-carotene concentrations, controlling for the following variables: gender, age, educational level, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, time of infection with HIV, presence of comorbidities, CD4(+) T lymphocyte count, total cholesterol and fractions, and triglyceride levels. There was no significant difference in vitamin A or beta-carotene concentrations in patients under the different HAART regimens. However, approximately 4% of the patients had deficient/low concentrations of vitamin A (<0.70 μmol/L), and 98% showed concentrations of beta-carotene <1.0 μmol/L. In conclusion, HIV/AIDS patients in this region will not benefit from vitamin A supplementation, independently of the HAART regimen utilized, but beta-carotene may be of importance, considering its antioxidant effect.

We aimed to verify if blood IFN concentration, a putative biomarker of interferon preactivation, might depend on carriage of a given IL28B genotype and/or advanced hepatic fibrosis. The study population included 187 hepatitis C patients (75 of whom were HIV coinfected), who were genotyped for the rs12979860 polymorphism and staged non-invasively by transient elastography. Blood IFN, measured by an enzyme immunoassay, was detectable in 68/187 patients (36%). Seventy-three patients (39%) were C/C homozygotes, 25 (13%) were T/T homozygotes, and 89 (48%) were heterozygotes. The fibrosis stage was F0-F1 in 70 patients (37%), F2-F3 in 54 patients (29%), and F4 in 63 patients (34%). IFN levels were higher among patients with HIV coinfection (p=0.044) and patients with better renal function (p=0.041), without association with the IL28B genotype or the hepatitis C stage. From the multivariate analysis, the only independent predictor of higher level of IFN was the age of patients (p=0.019), whereas independent predictors of a fibrosis stage ≥ F2 were age (p=0.007), belonging to the HIV/HCV group (p=0.048) and current alcohol consumption (p=0.008). In conclusion, a sizable proportion of HCV carriers have detectable IFN levels that do not indicate a greater severity of disease or display any relationships to specific rs12979860 variants."

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the HIV-infected population demonstrates increased sensitivity to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. Minimal erythema dose values to UVB (MED-B) of 57 consecutive HIV-infected patients were compared to those of a control group of 57 consecutive patients with skin diseases, who were otherwise healthy and had no risk factors for HIV infection. MED-B determinations were performed in all individuals prior to the initiation of phototherapy for treatment of skin disease. None of the patients had a history of photosensitivity. Furthermore, the mean levels of the highest UVB doses received by each group during the treatment courses were compared. The mean age of the HIV-infected cohort was 43 years (range 26-61 years). The mean MED-B for this group was 82.8 +/- 3.8 (SEM) mJ/cm2. The mean age of the control group was 45 years (range 24-77 years), and their mean MED-B was 81.0 +/- 3.8 (SEM) mJ/cm2. After 12 weeks of treatment, one HIV-infected patient developed photosensitivity associated with a decreased MED-B value. The mean level of the highest UVB doses received by the HIV-infected group [427.5 +/- 67.2 (SEM) mJ/cm2] was lower than that received by the control group [640.8 +/- 65.9 (SEM) mJ/cm2], since HIV-infected patients received fewer treatments (mean: 34.7 treatments per patient) than the patients in the control group (mean: 65.6 treatments per patient). These data indicate that the HIV-infected patient population, without history of photosensitivity, does not show increased sensitivity to UVB light as determined by MED-B values."

HBsAg-positive patients with NHL were identified from the lymphoma database of the Asan Medical Center from January 1995 to August 2002, and their medical records were reviewed. We found that 31 patients were received cytotoxic chemotherapy among 41 NHL patients with HBsAg-positive during same period. We divided them into 2 groups of HBsAg patients with NHL as follows: Group A who received cytotoxic chemotherapy with lamivudine 100 mg daily; Group B without any prophylactic antiviral therapy. There were no significant differences between Group A and B in several clinical variables. Seventeen patients (85%) in group B and one patient (9%) in Group A had hepatitis due to reactivation of HBV (p<0.001), with one hepatic failure related death in Group B and none in group A. The mean dose intensity of adriamycin actually delivered was 13.3 mg/m2/week (80% Relative Dose intensity (RDI)) in Group A and 9.1 mg/m2/week (55% RDI) in Groups B (p<0.001). Our data suggest that the frequency of chemotherapy-related HBV reactivation may be significantly decreased by lamivudine prophylaxis with maintenance of the dosage of adriamycin."

In the present retrospective study, 66 patients with HCV infection and positivity for RF were observed between March 2001 and January 2004; they had received combined therapy with Peg-IFN alpha-2b 1.5 mcg/kg/weekly and ribavirin 800-1200 mg/daily (on the basis of body weight). Before treatment, all of them had presented hypertransaminasemia for at least 6 months and high viral load. No patient suffered from other hypersensitivity disorders. The follow-up period lasted for a mean period of 26+/-7 months, after which only 34 (51.5%) revealed normal transaminases activity with negativity of HCV-RNA (long-term responders, LTR), while the remaining 32 (48.5%) were classified as non responders (NR). In both groups significant variations of RF values were observed. Moreover, RF remained positive in 6 (17.6%) of the LTR group and in 17 (53.1%) of the NR group patients. These data suggest a possible inhibiting action of the combined therapy on the exaggerated immune response. This effect appears partially unrelated to the antiviral action of the therapy."

However, information regarding the complement-bound HBV circulating immune complexes (CIC) in HBV-infected patients is currently not available. In the present study, we have combined immuno-capture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and developed a quick method of high specificity for the detection of complement-bound HBV CIC. We found that the frequency of HBV-factor B was associated with clinical types of hepatitis B (HB) but not with that of HBV-C1q. Moreover, increased frequency at P < 0.05 were found for HBV/C1q-CIC in the group with normal total bilirubin (TBIL) and for HBV/factor B-CIC in the group with positive hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). These findings suggest that the immuno-capture PCR (iPCR) for the detection of HBV-bound CIC is a valuable method for analysis of the composition of the immune complexes and for the understanding of host immune response and immune pathogenesis in HBV-infected individuals. In summary, iPCR is a valuable method for analysis of the composition of the immune complexes, which may provide new and valuable insights into HBV pathogenesis."

Identification was based on a prolonged APTT (> 40 seconds) that normalized with increased phospholipid concentrations and/or a prolonged Russell viper venom clotting time patient-control ratio of 1.20 or greater. In 68 cases (group 1), patient plasma prolonged the APTT of normal plasma in a 1:1 mixing study. However, in 32 cases (group 2), no such prolongation was observed. There was a significant difference between presenting APTTs in patients from group 1 (mean +/- SD, 58.29 +/- 13.30 seconds) compared with that in group 2 (mean +/- SD, 47.93 +/- 5.09 seconds). Furthermore, 66% of group 1 patients had elevated anticardiolipin antibody titers compared with only 41% in group 2. Of the 32 patients in group 2, 16 (50%) were positive for human immunodeficiency virus. We concluded that the investigation of a lupus anticoagulant should not be abandoned because patient plasma does not prolong the APTT of normal plasma in a mixing study, especially in a human immunodeficiency virus-positive population."

All these patients were seropositive for HIV. Two of the groups (nonprogressors) were clinically stable for approximately 2 years and were characterized either as asymptomatic or with PGL. The third group (progressors) developed AIDS 2-38 months after blood specimens were taken. The fourth group had AIDS. A fifth group of anti-HIV-seronegative heterosexual males completed the study. The geometric mean IgA serum concentration was more markedly elevated over normal control sera than any of the other study groups and was the only Ig isotype that was significantly higher in the progressor than in the nonprogressor group. The geometric IgG1 serum concentration was significantly higher in asymptomatic nonprogressors, PGL-nonprogressors, progressors, and AIDS patient groups than that in HIV-seronegative normals. In contrast, the geometric mean IgG2 serum concentration is depressed in all the anti-HIV-seropositive patients (but not significantly with the AIDS group). Multivariate analysis showed the Ig-isotype assays to have much less predictive power for progression to AIDS than the T-helper cell assays."

Phylogenetic analysis of this pol region highlights a cluster of these four HIV-1 group O sequences with seven other group O isolates (5% intracluster nucleotide sequence diversity) similar to clusters classified as subtypes in HIV-1 group M (an average of 4.9% intrasubtype sequence diversity). Based on these analyses, this group O cluster has been designated subtype A-O. A longitudinal study of a heterosexual couple infected with group O (ESP1 and ESP2) allowed a detailed analysis of RT sequences (amino acids 28 to 219). Directed evolution and a slightly higher mutation frequency was observed in the RT sequences of patient ESP2, treated with antiretroviral drugs, than that from the untreated patient ESP1. Antiretroviral treatment also selected for specific substitutions, M184V and T215Y in the RT coding region, conferring resistance to 3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine and zidovudine, respectively. A Gly98 to Glu RT substitution identified in the treated patient suggests a possible reversion of a nonnucleoside RT inhibitor-resistant phenotype. Using RT clones from this longitudinal study, both heteroduplex tracking assay and cloning-sequencing techniques were employed for an extensive genetic analysis of pol gene quasispecies. Amino acid substitutions (i.e., Phe-77 to Leu, Lys-101 to Glu, and Val-106 to Iso) associated with antiretroviral resistance were identified in RT clones from HIV-1 group O-infected patients not subjected to drug therapy or treated with unrelated drugs. Finally, phylogenetic relationships between RT clones of the treated ESP2 patient and those of the untreated ESP1 patient show how drug pressure can direct evolution of viral pol gene quasispecies independently of direct drug-resistant substitutions."

The aim of this study was to evaluate if HIV-infected patients with onychomycosis who begin cART improve and/or cure without antifungal treatment. We included HIV-infected patients with onychomycosis who had not started cART and nor received antifungal therapy during 6 months prior to the study. We evaluated affected the nails with the Onychomycosis Severity Index (OSI); nail scrapings were collected and direct microscopy with potassium hydroxide (KOH) as well as mycological culture were performed. We repeated these procedures at 3 and 6 months to assess changes. CD4 T cell counts and HIV viral load were obtained. A total of 16 patients were included, with male gender predominance (68.7%); distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO) was the most common form (31.3%). Trichophyton rubrum was the most frequently isolated microorganism. OSI decreased 21.5% at 3 months and 40% at 6 months after initiation of antiretrovirals (P = 0.05). We found a non-significant tendency towards improvement with higher CD4(+) T cell counts and with viral loads <100 000 copies ml(-1). This could be due to the increase in CD4(+) T cells, decreased percentage of Treg (CD4(+)CD25(+)) among CD4(+) Tcells and/or a decreased viral load; further studies are necessary to prove these hypothesis."

Stavudine (CAS 3056-17-5) is a synthetic thymidine nucleoside analogue, active against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Lamivudine and stavudine in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) agents are indicated for the treatment of HIV infection. As there are no suitable pediatric ARVs, adult fixed-dose ARVs are commonly used in children. This practice poses concerns about dose inaccuracy, which may lead to resistance or toxicity. A new fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet for oral suspension, containing lamivudine 40 mg and stavudine 10 mg has been developed. An open-label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single-dose, crossover bioequivalence study was conducted following administration of a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and stavudine tablet for oral suspension (test formulation) and innovator products (reference formulations) in healthy, adult, male human subjects under fasting condition. Multiple blood samples were collected up to 36 h post dose. Plasma concentrations of lamivudine and stavudine were assayed using validated high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry analytical method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non-compartmental analysis and bioequivalence was assessed using a mixed effect ANOVA model. The ratio of the least-square means (FDC to individual products) and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity) and C(max) for lamivudine and stavudine were all within 80.00-125.00%, suggesting a similar rate and extent of ARVs exposure in the bloodstream. The FDC and individual products were equally safe and well tolerated. The current FDC of lamivudine and stavudine is expected to provide a similar efficacy/safety profile as co-administration of the individual products, a better adherence to treatment, and considerable cost savings in the treatment of HIV in children."

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2,987 participants in Guangxi province, China, between 2012 and 2013. We employed both explanatory and predictive modeling strategy by using multivariate linear regression models. In the explanatory models, we assessed the association between routes of infection and three types of stigma (perceived, internalized, and enacted). From identified routes of infection that significantly contributed to higher stigma, we employed predictive modeling to explore predictors for the specific type of stigma. Multiple-imputation was employed for sensitivity analyses. Of the total sample, 63% were male and the average age was 42.9 years (ranged between 18 and 88). Multivariate regression models revealed that contraction from commercial sex increased the perceived (β = 0.46, 95%CI = 0.02, 0.90) and internalized stigma (β = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.09, 1.10), while injecting drug use increased the perceived (β = 0.65, 95%CI = 0.07, 1.22) and enacted stigma (β = 0.09, 95%CI = 0.02, 0.16) after controlling for confounders. Among PLWHA who were infected via commercial sex partners, social support was negatively associated with perceived (β = -0.47, 95%CI = -0.79, -0.14) and internalized stigma (β = -0.80, 95%CI = -1.24, -0.35). Among PLWHA who were infected via injecting drugs, no adherence to antiretroviral treatment (β = 0.41, 95%CI = 0.01, 0.82) was positively associated with perceived stigma, and disclosure of serostatus to others was negatively associated with enacted stigma (β = -0.20, 95%CI = -0.34, -0.05). Knowledge of the association between routes of infection and stigma can guide health professionals and policy makers to develop tailored intervention strategies to mitigate the effects of stigma and enhance HIV care utilization among PLWHA in China.

One thousand and eight individuals over 18 years of age bearing HIV/aids and being attended in the reference public health network of the state of Mato Grosso participated in this research. HIV-positive subjects were interviewed and blood samples were taken to be tested for anti-HCV antibodies by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The anti-HCV antibodies were investigated in all the individuals by immunoenzymatic assay. The reactive samples in duplicate were submitted to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect HCV-RNA. The positive tests were submitted for genotyping by the LIA method. One hundred and ten (10.9%; CI 95%: 9.1-13.0) HIV-positive individuals presented anti-HCV by EIA. The PCR was positive in 60 (6.0%; CI 95%: 4.6-7.6) individuals. The 1a genotype was the most frequent, followed by the 3a and 1b. The genotype 2 was found in only one individual. There were more male and intravenous drug users among HIV-HCV coinfected individuals when compared to only HIV-infected individuals. Multivariate analysis revealed an association between the HIV-HCV coinfection, regarding either EIA or PCR results, and the use of intravenous drugs, the presence of tattoos, and having received blood transfusions before 1994. There was no association of the coinfection with the variables related to sexual transmission. The relatively low prevalence of HCV infection in the HIV-positive population in that region may be a consequence of a small number of intravenous drug users in the sample, despite a strong association between HCV infection and use of intravenous drugs."

To investigate whether HSV-2 infection directly facilitates mucosal HIV-1 acquisition, we used our transgenic hCD4/R5/cT1 mouse model which circumvents major entry and transcription blocks preventing murine HIV-1 infection by targeting transgenic expression of human CD4, CCR5, and cyclin T1 genes to CD4(+) T cells and myeloid-committed cells. Productive infection of mucosal leukocytes, predominantly CD4(+) T cells, was detected in all hCD4/R5/cT1 mice intravaginally challenged with an HIV-1 infectious molecular clone, HIV-Du151.2env-NLuc, which expresses an env gene (C.Du151.2) cloned from an acute heterosexually infected woman and a NanoLuc luciferase reporter gene. Lower genital tract HIV-1 infection after HIV-Du151.2env-NLuc intravaginal challenge was increased ~4-fold in hCD4/R5/cT1 mice coinfected with HSV-2. Furthermore, HIV-1 dissemination to draining lymph nodes was detected only in HSV-2-coinfected mice. HSV-2 infection stimulated local infiltration and activation of CD4(+) T cells and dendritic cells, likely contributing to the enhanced HIV-1 infection and dissemination in HSV-2-coinfected mice. We then used this model to demonstrate that a novel gel containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), the more potent prodrug of tenofovir (TFV), but not the TFV microbicide gel utilized in the recent CAPRISA 004, VOICE (Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic), and FACTS 001 clinical trials, was effective as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to completely prevent vaginal HIV-1 infection in almost half of HSV-2-coinfected mice. These results also support utilization of hCD4/R5/cT1 mice as a highly reproducible immunocompetent preclinical model to evaluate HIV-1 acquisition across the female genital tract."

In this study, we conducted a large population case-control study with 1,507 HBV-related HCC cases and 1,560 HBV persistent carriers. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ZNRD1-AS1 (rs3757328, rs6940552 and rs9261204) were genotyped using a TaqMan allelic discrimination assay, and the HBV genotypes were identified by multiplex PCR. We found consistently significant associations between the ZNRD1-AS1 rs6940552 and rs9261204 SNPs with an increased risk of HCC (additive genetic model: adjusted OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.03-1.32 for rs6940552; adjusted OR =1.20, 95% CI = 1.06-1.35 for rs9261204) and found a borderline association between rs3757328 and HCC risk. Besides, we observed a dose-dependent relationship between increasing numbers of variant alleles of the SNPs and HCC risk (P for trend <0.001). Moreover, we observed a stronger combined effect of the three SNPs on HCC risk among the subjects infected with non-B genotype HBV (adjusted OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.05-1.50) compared with HBV B-related genotypes (adjusted OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.69-1.15; P= 0.029 for heterogeneity test).

LV mass/height(2.7) was similar between the HIV-infected and the HIV-uninfected groups (41.4 +/- 11.1 vs. 39.9 +/- 10.3 g/h(2.7); p = 0.37). The prevalence of LVH was similar between the two groups (LVH by LV mass/height(2.7) criteria 15.0% vs. 13.0%, p = 0.29). Relative wall thickness (RWT), defined as the ratio of LV wall thickness to cavity diameter, was also similar between the HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected groups (0.36 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.37 +/- 0.06, p = 0.16). On multiple linear regression analysis adjusting for age, W/H ratio, triceps skinfold thickness, systolic/diastolic BP, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia; HIV status (b = 2.08, p = 0.02, CI 0.27-3.88); weight (b per kg = 0.15, p < 0.01, CI 0.08-0.22); and smoking duration (b per one-year increase = 0.08, p = 0.03, CI 0.01-0.16) were independent correlates of LV mass/height(2.7) (Model R(2) = 0.20, p < 0.001). Weight (aOR = 1.04, CI 1.01-1.06) and smoking duration (aOR = 1.03, CI 1.01-1.06) were independent correlates of LVH. Being HIV negative, increased age, increased triceps skinfold thickness, and higher W/H ratio were independent correlates of higher RWT. Among HIV-infected women, higher LV mass was not associated with a history of AIDS-defining illness, nadir CD4(+) count <200 cells/microl, or with the duration of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Women taking NRTIs had higher LV mass. Higher RWT was associated with current CD4(+) count. In conclusion, HIV infection is associated with greater LV mass but not with a higher prevalence of LVH. Among HIV-infected women, RWT, but not LV mass, is associated with the degree of immunosuppression."

Socio-cultural factors are central to the way an individual constructs hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, perceives it as serious health problem, and moves on to appropriate health behavior (Lee et al., J Canc Educ 25:337-342, 2010; Kim, J Health Care Poor Underserved 5:170-182, 2004; Lee et al., Asian Nurs Res 1:1-11, 2007; Wu et al, Asian Pac J Cancer Prev 8(1):127-234, 2007; Yang et al., J Korean Academy Nurs 40:662-675, 2010). The purpose of this study was to seek ""real world"" data about factors that influence the recognition and management of HBV infection in Korean Americans' socio-cultural contexts. The descriptive qualitative study used an interview informed by ethnography to collect data and was guided by the Network-Episode Model. (Pescosolido, Adv Med Sociol 2:161-184, 1991; Pescosolido, AJS 97:1096-1138, 1992; Pescosolido, Res Sociol Health Care 13A:171-197, 1996). The sample comprised 12 HBV patients and nine key informants. Six factors that influenced the management of HBV infection emerged from the interviews: recognition of disease within a social context, unrecognized disease in a hidden health system, the socio-cultural meaning of disease, lay construction of the cause of disease, misunderstandings and cultural learning styles, and personal and environmental barriers to health care. Each theme was associated with Korean American (KA) social contexts, participants' experiences, and the beliefs they held about the disease. The findings explored that the family network is ""genetic code"" for social networking among KAs and the network of patients was not geographically bound. Health management behaviors are mediated by an array of types and levels of social and personal networks, and this raises questions about current health education, management of HBV, and prevention of liver cancer."

IDUs were enrolled in 23 semiannual cross-sections from three community sites. For identification of recent infections, less sensitive enzyme immunoassay testing was performed on stored specimens that had previously tested positive for HIV antibodies. Annualized incidence rates were calculated and logistic regression models were fitted for assessment of risk factors for recent HIV infection. Among 8,065 susceptible IDUs, 34 had recent infections, for an incidence rate of 1.2% (95% confidence interval: 0.7, 2.0) per person-year. This rate declined from 2.7% in 1987/1988 to approximately 1% per person-year between 1989 and 1998. Two IDU subpopulations were at highest risk for infection: persons under age 30 years (2.8% per person-year) and men who had sex with men (3.0% per person-year). Participants who reported prior HIV test-result counseling were less likely than others to become infected (adjusted odds ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.21, 0.87). Sensitive/less sensitive enzyme immunoassay testing is an effective tool for assessing HIV incidence. HIV incidence among street-recruited IDUs in San Francisco appears to have remained stable and moderate since the late 1980s."

To study the occurrence, associations, and effect on survival of thrombocytopenia in HIV-infected persons, we used surveillance data from a longitudinal survey of the medical records of 30,214 HIV-infected patients who received medical care from January 1990 through August 1996 in more than 100 medical clinics in 10 U.S. cities. Thrombocytopenia was defined as a physician diagnosis of thrombocytopenia or a platelet count of < 50,000 platelets/ microliter. Analysis of associations of thrombocytopenia was conducted using logistic regression. In HIV+ patients, the 1-year incidence [corrected] of thrombocytopenia was 8.7% in persons with one or more AIDS-defining opportunistic illnesses (clinical AIDS), 3.1% in patients with a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3 but not clinical AIDS (immunologic AIDS), and 1.7% in persons without clinical or immunologic AIDS. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was associated with clinical AIDS (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.2; 99% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-3.0), immunologic AIDS (AOR 1.5, CI 1.0-2.1), history of injecting drug use (AOR 1.4, CI 1.0-1.9), anemia (AOR 5.0, CI 3.8-6.7), lymphoma (AOR 3.7, CI 1.3-10.6), and black race (AOR 0.7, CI 0.5-0.9). After controlling for anemia, clinical AIDS, CD4 count, neutropenia, antiretroviral therapy, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis, thrombocytopenia was significantly associated with decreased survival (risk ratio 1.7; 95% CI, 1.6-1.8). Thrombocytopenia in HIV-infected persons is an important clinical condition associated with shorter survival."

However, differences between new and longer-term injecting drug users (IDUs) have not received as much attention. This study examined injecting initiation experience, risk and risk reduction practices, and self-reported HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing practices and infection among new (injecting < or =4 years) and longer-term IDUs. Data from 3 cross-sectional surveys in 1992, 1994, and 1997 of syringe exchange program (SEP) users in Oslo, Norway, were used. Approximately one fifth of IDUs were new injectors. New IDUs were increasingly indistinguishable from longer-term IDUs in terms of socio-demographics, risk practices, and HIV and HCV testing. The prevalence of HIV infection remained low (5%); in contrast, approximately two thirds of all SEP users reported being HCV-infected. Known HCV infection status had no impact on syringe sharing; most HCV-infected SEP users reported sharing syringes, regardless of the duration of injecting. The only variable associated with HCV infection was injecting < or =4 years (adjusted odds ratio = 0.2; 95% confidence interval = 0.1-0.4). Increased similarity in age between new and longer-term IDUs may have contributed to the rapid spread of HCV infection by facilitating mixing patterns between HCV-infected and -susceptible IDUs."

A swab was obtained from each patient by brushing candidal lesions. Candida albicans was isolated in 41 patients (64%), Candida glabrata in ten (16%), Candida krusei in five (8%), Candida kefyr in two (3%), Candida tropicalis in two (3%), and Candida lipolytica and Candida guilliermondii in one case, respectively. Two patients suffered a double infection i.e. C. albicans+C. krusei and C. albicans+C. glabrata, respectively. Candida species were tested in vitro for their susceptibility to ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and amphotericin B. MICs of the four antifungal drugs were obtained for each yeast using a microdilution broth method developed in our laboratory. Twenty four (37%) of the isolated strains were resistant both to itraconazole and fluconazole, five (8%) to fluconazole alone, and two (3%) to ketoconazole alone, while none of the isolated strains was resistant to amphotericin B. Patients with oral candidosis caused by a strain resistant to one or more azole drug were compared to control patients with azole-susceptible oral candidosis. On univariate analysis, more than five episodes of oral candidosis in the last year (P = 0.01), previous use of azole therapy (P = 0.001), C2-3 category of HIV infection (P = 0.01) and low number of circulating CD4+ T-cells (P = 0.03) were significantly associated with an increased risk for the development of azole resistance. However, previous use of azole therapy was the only factor selected by a stepwise logistic regression analysis which was independently associated with the isolation of azole resistant strains (P = 0.003). Our findings indicate that, in view of the potential risk for the emergence and selection of azole resistant strains of Candida in patients with AIDS, it is important to carefully choose the antifungal drug for the therapy of mild fungal infections after evaluation of the in-vitro susceptibility of the isolated strains."
13062,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"A problem arising in studies on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection relate to one-sided tests with ordered alternatives as opposed to the more classical two-sided tests. Patients not having a resistance mutation may have a better virologic response to treatment than patients with a single mutation. In turn, those with a single mutation may have a better response to treatment than those patients having two mutations, and so on. In the presence of a continuous outcome, Jonckheere's test for ordered alternatives is well adapted to this situation. Such an analysis does not provide any measure of prediction or explained variation which can complement these results. A measure of strength of effect would be helpful in quantifying the degree of association between the genotypic score (number of mutations) and some continuous virological response. We suggest a simple measure of 'goodness of split' for Jonckheere's test for trend. Interestingly, the measure can be related to the non-parametric measure of association known as gamma. The variance formula for the measure studied here can be seen to differ from the known variance estimate of the gamma measure, and simulations show it to be more accurate. Expectation and variance under H(0) of the measure are provided and a large simulation study is presented. Methods are applied to a recent clinical data set involving HIV-1 infected patients where the number of resistance mutations are investigated as potential predictors of the amount of HIV-1 RNA reduction at week 4."

The optimal plasma specimen collection and storage conditions for the use of such virologic markers for clinical trials were also determined. The variabilities in the measurement of infectious HIVLAI titer associated with intra- and interdonor peripheral blood mononuclear cells were 1.2 and 0.86 log10 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/ml (95% confidence interval range), respectively. Plasma HIV-1 titers did not change significantly after storing whole blood for 6 h either at 4 degrees C or ambient temperature or plasma for a median of 267 days (range, 259 to 482) at -70 degrees C. The detection of genomic HIV-1 RNA encapsulated in viral particles was very consistent, reproducible, and unaffected by either heparin or acid citrate or by multiple freeze-thawing. The HIV-1 RNA titers also appeared to generally correlate with the biologic titer obtained by the microculture assay. The consistency in infectious HIV-1 titer was evaluated by using 27 unfrozen plasma specimens collected from five subjects over 1 to 9 days. The median change in HIV-1 titer relative to baseline was -0.5 log10 TCID50/ml (interquartile range, -1.03 to 0.175 log10). In contrast, no significant change in HIV-1 RNA for the same frozen plasma specimens was noted. As such, immunocapture-cDNA-polymerase chain reaction may be a useful measure of plasma viremia for studying the natural history of HIV disease and assessing response to therapy."

Between November 1985 and October 1993, 978 HIV-1 seroconversions were seen among 1,061,768 soldiers, contributing over 3.6 million person-years of follow-up [seroconversion rate (95% confidence interval) = 0.27/1,000 person-years (0.25-0.29)]. A significant decreasing trend in HIV-1 seroconversion rates was seen over the analysis period. The rate of new infections declined significantly from the first interval, 1985-1987, (0.43/1,000 person-years) to the second interval, 1987-1988, (0.28/1,000 person-years), but stabilized at approximately 0.22/1,000 person-years after 1988, representing new infections in approximately 100-150 soldiers annually. The risk of seroconversion among active duty soldiers was significantly associated with racial/ethnic group, age, gender, and marital status. Surveillance of HIV-1 seroconversion rates in the U.S. Army continues to offer a unique opportunity to assess temporal trends in the evolving HIV-1 infection epidemic. Monitoring the rate of new HIV-1 infections allows for identification of subgroups in need of intervention, refocusing of intervention strategies, and evaluation of their effectiveness."
3724,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Additional progression markers for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are warranted. In this study we related antigen-specific responses in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells to CD38, reflecting chronic immune activation, and to CD4(+) T cell loss rates. Clones transiently expressing CD107a (CD8(+)) or CD154 (CD4(+)) in response to Gag, Env and Nef overlapping peptide pools were identified, along with their expression of the inhibitory programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 31 patients off antiretroviral treatment (ART). HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses dominated over CD4(+) T cell responses, and among CD8(+) responses, Gag and Nef responses were higher than Env-responses (P < 0.01). PD-1 on CD8(+) HIV-specific subsets was higher than CMV-specific CD8(+) cells (P < 0.01), whereas PD-1 on HIV-specific CD4(+) cells was similar to PD-1 on CMV-specific CD4(+) cells. Gag and Env CD8(+) responses correlated oppositely to the CD4 loss rate. Env/Gag CD8(+) response ratios, independently of PD-1 levels, correlated more strongly to CD4 change rates (r = -0.50 to -0.77, P < 0.01) than the total number of Gag-specific CD8(+) cells (r = 0.44-0.85, P < or = 0.02). The Env/Gag ratio performed better than CD38 and HIV-RNA in logistic regression analysis predicting CD4 change rate as a measure of progression. In conclusion, HIV-specific CD8(+)CD107a(+) Env/Gag response ratio was a stronger predictor for progression than CD38 and HIV-RNA. The Env/Gag ratio may reflect the balance between possibly beneficial (Gag) and detrimental (Env) CD8(+) T cell responses and should be explored further as a progression marker."

The level of sTNF alpha RII and HIV RNA was measured in serum and the CD4 lymphocyte count of 25 HIV-infected patients was determined. sTNF alpha RII ranged between 3.019 and 12.57 ng/mL (mean +/- SD, 6.705 +/- 2.5). HIV-1 RNA varied from 960 to 281,160 copies/mL (71,988 +/- 75,684). CD4 cell number was between 4 and 540/microL (181.3 +/- 152.2). Univariate analysis revealed a moderate inverse correlation of sTNF alpha RII with CD4 cell number (r = -.41, P < .05) and a strong positive correlation between sTNF alpha RII and log RNA copy number (r = .62, P < .001). On multivariate analysis, sTNF alpha RII strongly correlated with RNA copy number (P < .01) but not CD4 lymphocyte count. sTNF alpha RII measurements appear to be predictive of clinical outcomes because they are a surrogate indicator of the patients' immunologic response to a virus load."

We found that plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4+ lymphocyte counts did not change following this short course of beta-carotene supplementation. Patients with lower serum concentrations of beta-carotene before supplementation were no more likely to have an increase in their CD4+ lymphocyte count or plasma HIV RNA copy number than were those with higher concentrations. No correlation was found between pre- or postsupplementation beta-carotene or vitamin A concentrations and pre- or postsupplementation CD4+ lymphocyte counts or plasma HIV RNA titers.

To determine the proportion of exposed infants who are infected, we conducted a hospital-based prospective study in HIV-1-infected women whose infants were delivered at a single metropolitan hospital in Miami, Fla. A population of uninfected women and their infants was also enrolled and followed longitudinally for 2 years to assess laboratory and clinical measurements. The median follow-up is now 18 months for 82 infants born to HIV-1-infected mothers. The proportion of infected infants in this group is 0.30 (25/82). None of the infants born to 110 HIV-1-seronegative mothers were seropositive. Infected infants were easily distinguished from noninfected infants by virus isolation. No single immunologic or hematologic measure was predictive of infection for all infants at risk for HIV-1 infection who were 6 months of age or younger. As a group, however, infected infants could be distinguished from uninfected index infants by a number of immunologic measures by 6 months of age; the absolute number of CD4+ lymphocytes and the CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio were the variables most predictive of infection. As in retrospective studies, clinical disease developed in 80% of infected infants within the first 24 months of life.

The RNase I footprinting studies reveal that the primary binding site for the drug is in stem-loop 1, which contains the dimer initiation site of HIV-1. Loading this site with neomycin causes a structural change in the RNA, allowing nucleotides in the neighboring stem-loop 2 to participate in the drug site. Drug binding to secondary sites induces structural changes in other stem-loops of the RNA. Footprinting plots, showing cutting at a site as a function of drug concentration, were analyzed using a two-state model to obtain relative site-specific binding constants. Circular dichroism measurements show that neomycin binding to psi-RNA changes the intensity of the strong negative CD band at 208 nm, confirming that neomycin induces structural changes. Melting studies of the RNA showed melting transitions in the absence of drug at 28.2, 37.2, 47.4, 55.5 and 60.8 degrees C. Only the first two were affected by drug binding, the reason for this being explained by our analysis."

factors associated with nurses’ attitudes towards accepting co-workers with HIV,
HBV, or HCV. The study design was descriptive and cross-sectional. Four hundred
Vietnamese nurses participated in this study using stratified random sampling at
two public hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam. A self-administrated questionnaire was
used to obtain data. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression was
performed to analyze data. Nine percent of nurses had experienced a needle-stick
or sharps injury (NSI) from a patient infected with HIV, and 15.8% of respondents
reported having a previous NSI from a patient infected with HBV or HCV. Some
nurses reported that they could not accept contact between patients and nurses
infected with HIV (25.2%) and HBV or HCV (12.7%). Older age and a belief that
colleagues should disclose their infection status were associated with positive
attitudes towards HIV-, HBV-, or HCV-positive colleagues. Fear of transmission
was associated with negative attitudes towards HIV-positive co-workers. Infected
employees disclosure of their status may help their colleagues to be more accepting
by providing appropriate workplace adjustments for infected employees.
HIV is generally a more stigmatized infection, and therefore attitudes towards
HIV-positive co-workers might be affected by fear of transmission. Providing
education to recognize infectious risk may be effective in improving nurses’ attitudes
in Vietnam, as elsewhere."

A sample of 93 HIV survivors scoring high, i.e., ⩾74 on the 26-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-26), were compared to 79 low AL (TAS-26⩽54) survivors on measures of neurocognitive, psychological, neuroendocrine and immune function. Neurocognitive function was evinced by a standardized test of psychomotor speed, cognitive flexibility and task switching ability, HIV Dementia and general cognitive status. Patients were also screened for levels of depression, anxiety and psychological stress. A 24-h urinary norepinephrine (NE) and cortisol (CORT) collection was taken; blood was drawn for T lymphocyte subset counts (CD4+CD3+) and HIV-1 viral load. Alexithymic patients exhibited higher levels of executive dysfunction, psychological distress, norepinephrine-to-cortisol (NE/CORT) ratio and viral load. Linear regression models accounting for sociodemographic and disease-related variables revealed two AL subscales, difficulties identifying and describing feelings, predicted and explained a significant proportion of variance in the outcome measures. Specifically, poorer executive task-switching/cognitive flexibility was associated with greater difficulty describing feelings; dysregulated autonomic response (high NE/CORT ratio) and depressive symptoms were predicted by difficulty identifying feelings; higher levels of anxiety and psychological stress were both predicted by greater difficulty describing and identifying feelings. Overall, the psychoneuroimmunological profile of alexithymia in HIV positive persons at mid-stage of infection suggests a greater vulnerability for disease progression. "

Two cases of patients infected with HIV with isolated anti-HBc antibodies who had experienced an HBV reactivation are described. In the two cases HBV reactivation occurred after withdrawal of anti-retroviral treatment with anti-HBV activity from the patients' highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), in accordance with HIV genotypic resistance profiles. Consequently, plasma samples from 383 patients infected with HIV were tested to assess the prevalence of occult HBV infection in the Infectious Diseases Department Unit of Nancy Hospital by investigating serological patterns and HBV replication. Forty-five percent (172/383) of patients had had previous contact with HBV. Isolated anti-HBc antibodies were observed in 48 patients (48/383, 12%) and, among these, 2 were HBV-DNA positive. Since 75% (288/383) of the patients were treated with HAART, including at least one drug active against HBV, occult HBV infection was perhaps unrecognized. In cases of HIV infection, all patients should be screened for HBV infection and the knowledge of HBV status as well as the monitoring of HBV viral load are essential in preventing HBV reactivation. Consideration should be given to the continuation of drugs with anti-HBV activity in co-infected patients receiving HAART, as cessation of therapy is associated with a risk of HBV reactivation. At least, close monitoring of the HBV viral load is warranted in such situations."

HBV infection is endemic in Taiwan and most HBV carriers acquire the virus early in life. The impact of HBV factors on the natural course of patients with chronic HBV infection has been investigated in three cohort studies. The first Risk Evaluation of Viral Load Elevation and Associated Liver Disease/Cancer-Hepatitis B Virus (REVEAL-HBV) cohort study revealed that HBV viral load is a strong predictive factor for the risk of cirrhosis and HCC and baseline serum HBV DNA levels >2000 IU/ml may increase the risk of cirrhosis and HCC in adult HBV carriers. In the second Study of E Antigen seRoClearance of Hepatitis B (SEARCH-B), HBsAg level <100 IU/ml at 1-year post HBeAg seroconversion was shown to be a predictor of HBsAg seroclearance over time. Recently, the third Elucidation of Risk Factors for Disease Control or Advancement in Taiwanese Hepatitis B Carriers (ERADICATE-B) cohort study also suggested that HBsAg levels were a complementary predictive risk factor to HBV DNA levels for predicting HBV-related adverse events in patients with low viral load (HBV DNA level <2000 IU/ml). An HBsAg level >1000 IU/ml in HBeAg-negative patients with low viral load, is associated with higher risks of HCC, cirrhosis, and HBeAg-negative hepatitis. Based on results of the REVEAL-HBV cohort study, a risk calculator to predict HCC in non-cirrhotic patients was developed and validated by independent international cohorts (REACH-B). In the recent update of the REVEAL-HBV study, HBsAg level was incorporated into the HCC risk prediction model with excellent accuracy. In conclusion, evidence from these HBV clinical cohorts confirms the progression and integration of viral biomarkers for the prediction of the prognosis of Asian chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. If the predictive power of the HCC risk calculator could be validated in non-Asian populations, it could be used in clinical practice to individualize the management of HBV carriers with different levels of HCC risk."

The present analysis focused on the second phase of the Perfil-es study, where sociodemographic and clinical data were retrospectively collected from patients starting NNRTI- or PI/r-based regimens in order to identify factors that could influence the choice of initial ART. Patients' characteristics were compared by both bivariate and multivariate analyses. A total of 642 patients were evaluated. The main transmission group was men who have sex with men (MSM) (48%), and 24% of patients were coinfected with hepatitis B or C. Patients with cardiovascular risk accounted for 56%, and 15% had a neuropsychiatric history. Anxiolytics (29%), antidepressants (18%) and methadone (18%) were the most frequent concomitant medications. The use of PI/r-based regimens was more frequent in older patients, childbearing potential women patients coinfected with hepatitis B or C, and those with cardiovascular risk and a neuropsychiatric history. The presence of a neuropsychiatric disorder (OR: 1.912; CI 95%: 1.146-3.191; p < .05) and the use of concomitant medication (OR: 1.736; CI 95%: 1.204-2.502; p < .01) were identified as independent factors associated with the selection of PI/r-based regimens. MSM sexual conduct was the only independent factor related to the selection of NNRTI-based ART (OR: 0.699; CI 95%: 0.504-0.970; p < .05). Neither the physicians' characteristics nor the geographical area where HIV patients were attended influenced the choice of ART. In conclusion, patients' comorbidity, pregnancy potential and lifestyle seem to influence the choice of ART. Neuropsychiatric comorbidity and concomitant medication, mainly related to this condition, appear to be associated with the use of PI/r-based initial ART while MSM seem more likely to receive NNRTI-based regimens in Spain."

The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors for HTLV-1/2 infection in HIV-infected patients attending the AIDS Reference Center serving Londrina (and surrounding region), Paraná, Brazil. Data concerning sociodemographic conditions and risk factors were collected from 784 HIV-infected patients, using a questionnaire. Blood samples were obtained from 758 of the patients and subjected to serologic screening tests for the determination of HTLV-1/2, as well as hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and syphilis. Most patients were white (mean age, 35.9 years); 55.9% were males and 44.1% were females. The most frequent sexually transmitted disease was gonorrhea (28.5%), followed by syphilis (14.3%) and condyloma (12.2%). The major risk factors associated with the acquisition of retroviruses were sexual contact (84.8%) and intravenous drug use (IDU, 11.9%). The overall infection seroprevalence was 6.4% for HTLV-1/2, 37.2% for HBV, 21.0% for HCV, and 24.4% for syphilis. HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infections were confirmed in 0.8 and 4.9% of patients, respectively. HIV/HTLV-1/2 coinfection was more frequent in IDUs (59.2% of cases) and was strongly associated with HCV (22.60 [95% CI, 10.35-49.35]). A weak association with HBV (2.09 [95% CI, 1.13-3.90]) and no association with syphilis were observed. The results showed that human retroviruses are circulating in southern Brazil, mainly among white people of both genders of low socioeconomic conditions and educational level. Although the sexual route was considered to be the major risk factor for HIV infection, HTLV-1/2 infection was strongly associated with IDU."

Therefore, we analysed specific mutations in HBV-infected Vietnamese patients and assessed their potential relationship with their clinical outcome. A total of 153 HBV-infected Vietnamese patients with well-characterised clinical profiles were enrolled. None of the study participants had a history of alcohol or drug use and none received any antiviral or immunosuppressive therapy before or during the course of this study. The HBx- and core promoter regions were analysed by sequencing. The majority of isolates corresponded to genotype A. The presence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) was associated with significantly higher viral loads in the chronic HBV-infection group (P = 0.026). Double mutations in the core promoter (1762/1764) were more frequent in those with cancer than in noncancer patients (P < 0.01). Mutations at nucleotide (nt) 1766/1773 were found at low prevalence but with no obvious association to clinical presentation. Cytosine at nt 1858 was predominant but the stop codon mutation in the precore region was not detected. In the study, 4/48 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients revealed truncated HBx, whilst the serine to alanine mutation (codon 31) of HBx was more prevalent in cancer patients than in asymptomatic HBV carriers (P < 0.01). Thus, the low frequency of mutations indicates the relation of the absence of antiviral pressure in this population. The exclusively found prevalence of certain mutations detected in those with HBV-related carcinoma nevertheless indicates a degree of association with disease progression."

This situation has been frequently described in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of occult hepatitis B in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients and its clinical relevance in liver histology and viral response after interferon therapy for HCV. A total of 238 HIV-HCV-infected patients,negative for HBsAg, were included. Serum samples were analyzed for the presence of HBV DNA and HBcAb.HBV DNA quantification was determined with the Cobas TaqMan HBV Test (detection limit 6 IU/ml). Data from liver biopsy and laboratory tests were also analyzed. HBcAb resulted in 142 (60%) patients, being the independent associated factors: male gender, previous history of intravenous drug use, age, CD4 count,and HAV antibody presence. Among 90 HBcAb patients that we could analyze, HBV DNA was positive in 15 (16.7% of occult hepatitis B infection in this group, and 6.3% in the whole HIV-HCV cohort studied). No baseline factors, liver histology, or HCV therapy response were related to the presence of HBV DNA. We found that occult hepatitis B is a frequent condition present in at least 6.3% of our HCV-HIV patients and in more than 16% of those with HBcAb. Despite the high prevalence, this phenomenon does not seem to affect the clinical evolution of chronic hepatitis C or modify the viral response to interferon-based HCV therapies"
7740,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"One-third of all HIV-infected individuals in the United States are estimated to be coinfected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Treatment of chronic hepatitis C in patients coinfected with HIV is a complex problem associated with toxicities and drug interactions between HIV antiretrovirals and interferon and ribavirin. In recent HCV treatment studies, we observed a previously unreported development of hypophosphatemia in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients treated with interferon/ribavirin (IFN/RBV). To further investigate this observation, we retrospectively reviewed 61 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients on antiretrovirals (ARVs) during treatment with IFN/RBV as well as 154 HIV-infected patients treated with ARVs alone. We found that HIV/HCV-coinfected patients on IFN/RBV therapy were more likely to develop frequent (57% vs. 13%, IFN/RBV-treated patients vs. no IFN/RBV; χ(2)=0.001) and higher-grade hypophosphatemia (67.0% Grade 2, 33.3% Grade 3 vs. 94.7% Grade 2, 5.3% Grade 3, IFN/RBV-treated patients vs. no IFN/RBV; χ(2)<0.001) than untreated patients. In addition, we found that the new onset of hypophosphatemia after IFN/RBV treatment initiation was followed by a diminished frequency of this toxicity upon cessation of IFN/RBV, supporting the idea that a drug-drug interaction may increase the risk of this toxicity. To understand the risks of developing this toxicity, we evaluated the association between individual ARV use and hypophosphatemia incidence. Our data suggest that concomitant tenofovir (TDF) use may be a risk factor for the development of hypophosphatemia in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients treated with IFN/RBV. Although the etiology of this abnormality is likely multifactorial, clinicians should be aware of hypophosphatemia as a potential marker of renal toxicity in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients being treated with IFN/RBV regimens."

The impact of inflammatory cytokines on liver fibrosis is not well understood. We studied the association between interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and liver fibrosis in HIV-infected patients with current or past alcohol problems (CAGE ≥2 or physician investigator diagnosis). Liver fibrosis was estimated with FIB-4 (FIB-4 <1.45 defined the absence of liver fibrosis and FIB-4 >3.25 defined advanced fibrosis). Logistic regression was used to assess the association between cytokines and fibrosis, adjusting for age, sex, CD4, HIV RNA, current antiretroviral therapy, body mass index, and HCV. Secondary analyses explored whether the association between HCV and liver fibrosis was mediated by these cytokines. Participants (n=308) were all HIV-infected; 73% were male with a mean age of 42 years; half had detectable HCV-RNA, 60.7% had an absence of liver fibrosis, and 10.1% had advanced fibrosis. In models that adjusted for each cytokine separately, higher levels of IL-6 were significantly associated with an absence of fibrosis [adjusted OR (95% CI): 0.43 (0.19, 0.98), p=0.05] and were borderline significant for advanced fibrosis [adjusted OR (95% CI): 8.16 (0.96, 69.54), p=0.055]. In the final model, only higher levels of IL-6 remained significantly associated with advanced liver fibrosis [adjusted OR (95% CI): 11.78 (1.17, 118.19), p=0.036]. Adjustment for inflammatory cytokines attenuated the adjusted OR for the association between HCV and fibrosis in the case of IL-6 [for the absence of fibrosis from 0.32 (0.17, 0.57) p<0.01 to 0.47 (0.23, 0.96) p=0.04; and for advanced fibrosis from 7.22 (2.01, 25.96) p<0.01 to 6.62 (1.20, 36.62) p=0.03], suggesting IL-6 may be a partial mediator of the association between HCV and liver fibrosis. IL-6 was strongly and significantly associated with liver fibrosis in a cohort of HIV-infected patients with alcohol problems. IL-6 may be a useful predictive marker for liver fibrosis for HIV-infected patients."

A prospective, observational cohort study was carried out. Hospitalized AIDS patients were evaluated for age; gender; coinfection with hepatitis; diabetes mellitus; hypertension; time since HIV seroconversion; CD4 count; HIV viral load; proteinuria; serum levels of creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium and magnesium; antiretroviral use; nephrotoxic drug use; sepsis; intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and the need for dialysis. Each of these characteristics was correlated with the development of acute kidney injury, with recovery of renal function and with survival. Fifty-four patients developed acute kidney injury: 72% were males, 59% had been HIV-infected for >5 years, 72% had CD4 counts <200 cells/mm(3), 87% developed electrolyte disturbances, 33% recovered renal function, and 56% survived. ICU admission, dialysis, sepsis and hypomagnesemia were all significantly associated with nonrecovery of renal function and with mortality. Nonrecovery of renal function was significantly associated with hypomagnesemia, as was mortality in the multivariate analysis. The risks for nonrecovery of renal function and for death were 6.94 and 6.92 times greater, respectively, for patients with hypomagnesemia. In hospitalized AIDS patients, hypomagnesemia is a risk factor for nonrecovery of renal function and for in-hospital mortality. To determine whether hypomagnesemia is a determinant or simply a marker of critical illness, further studies involving magnesium supplementation in AIDS patients are warranted."

The questionnaires consisted of 68 items including infection control practices, knowledge, and attitudes towards AIDS/HIV. The response rate was 51.1 percent (N = 289). The average age of dentists in the sample was 43.7 +/- 9.5 (S.D.) (range: 28 to 85). Data was evaluated statistically by Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney's U test and Chi-square test, and significant differences were observed. Gloves, masks, and other protective garments were generally worn, but most dentists did not always use them during the full course of treatment limiting usage to surgical treatment, and when treating patients in ""high-risk groups"". Other infection control procedures, such as instrument sterilization, did not comply with the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Two dentists responded that they had treated AIDS patients and three dentists treated possible AIDS/HIV patients in their dental offices. Despite 71.3% expressing a belief that they have a moral responsibility as a dentist to treat AIDS/HIV patients only 15.6% were willing to treat AIDS/HIV patients. Over 40% of the respondents were not certain as to whether they had treated AIDS/HIV patients or not, and over 60% believed AIDS/HIV patients would come to their dental offices in the near future. Therefore, to practice dentistry on AIDS/HIV patients safely, dentists must provide effective infection control in their dental offices on the assumption that all patients are AIDS/HIV positive, and additional information about AIDS/HIV and adequate training on procedures in the care of AIDS/HIV patients are needed."

Recent studies have reported that IR is associated with liver fibrosis progression in these patients. However, there is no information available on this issue in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients. For these reasons, we investigate the relationship between IR and liver fibrosis in patients with HIV and HCV infections. This was a cross-sectional study where patients from an Infectious Diseases Unit with HIV/HCV coinfection who underwent a liver biopsy, with available frozen sera samples at the time of biopsy and a known or estimated date of infection were included. IR was determined by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) method. The relationship between histological findings and several variables, including HOMA-IR values, was examined. Seventy-nine patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Age at HCV infection >21 years was the only variable independently associated with advanced liver fibrosis (stages F3 and F4) [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-11.3]. The variables associated with a fibrosis progression rate above the median were age at HCV infection >21 years (AOR 6.41; 95% CI 2.16-27.96) and previous exposure to nevirapine (AOR 8.9; 95% CI 2.01-39.36). There was no association between HOMA-IR values and the presence of advanced fibrosis or a faster fibrosis progression. Thus IR is not associated with liver damage or fibrosis progression in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals."

Alexithymia (AL) is a trait deficit in the ability to identify and describe feelings, emotions and bodily sensations. A structural equation model was used to test whether high levels of AL indirectly relate to greater non-adherent behavior and HIV disease severity via psychosocial dysfunction. Blood draws for HIV-1 viral load and CD4 T-lymphocyte, along with psychosocial surveys were collected from 439 HIV positive adults aged 18-73 years. The structural model supports significant paths from: (1) AL to non-active patient involvement, psychological distress, and lower social support, (2) psychological distress and non-active involvement to non-adherent behavior, and (3) non-adherence to greater HIV disease severity (CFI = .97, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .05). A second model confirmed the intermediary effect of greater patient assertiveness on the path from AL to social support and non-active patient involvement (CFI = .94, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .05). Altogether, AL is indirectly linked with HIV disease management through it's association with poor psychosocial function, however greater patient assertiveness buffers the negative impact of AL on relationship quality with healthcare providers and members of one's social support network."

A total of 139 patients with chronic hepatitis C who received therapy for 48 weeks were enrolled. The secondary structure of the 120 residues of the amino-terminal HCV-1b non-structural region 3 (NS3) deduced from the amino acid sequence was classified into two major groups: A and B. The association between HCV NS3 protein polymorphism and virological response was analyzed in patients infected with group A (n = 28) and B (n = 40) isolates who had good adherence to both pegylated interferon and ribavirin administration (>95% of the scheduled dosage) for 48 weeks. A sustained virological response (SVR) representing successful HCV eradication occurred in 33 (49%) in the 68 patients. Of the 28 patients infected with the group A isolate, 18 (64%) were SVR, whereas of the 40 patients infected with the group B isolate only 15 (38%) were SVR. The proportion of virological responses differed significantly between the two groups (P < 0.05). These results suggest that polymorphism in the secondary structure of the HCV-1b NS3 amino-terminal region influences the virological response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy, and that virus grouping based on this polymorphism can contribute to prediction of the outcome of this therapy."

The goal of this study was to examine whether an IL28B polymorphism (rs8099917) is associated with natural clearance of HCV and with disease parameters of HCV infection in an HCV hyperendemic area of Japan. The patients were 502 anti-HCV antibody-positive residents who participated in liver disease screening program from 2002 to 2004. Patients who underwent interferon-based therapy or had hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. Of these patients, 149 were negative for HCV RNA (prior infection) and 353 were positive for HCV RNA or HCV core antigen (HCV carriers). In multivariate analysis, the IL28B TT genotype was a predictor for prior HCV infection. In addition, nine of the patients with prior HCV infection were positive for anti-HCV antibody with positive for HCV core antigen or HCV RNA before 2001, and these nine patients all had the IL28B TT genotype. Furthermore, the IL28B TT genotype was associated independently with higher HCV core antigen levels in HCV carriers. In contrast, the IL28B genotype did not affect the biochemical markers, such as alanine aminotransferase, hepatic fibrosis markers, and α-fetoprotein, and the degree of hepatic fibrosis assessed by transient elastography in HCV carriers. We concluded that IL28B polymorphism (TT genotype) is associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV and conversely with high viral loads in HCV carriers. In contrast, the IL28B genotype does not affect disease progression such as hepatic fibrosis."

It was found that the prevalence of HCV infection increased in parallel with the severity of liver damage. The positive rates of anti-HCV were as follows: healthy subjects, 2.9% (8/275); asymptomatic carriers, 2.6% (5/193); chronic hepatitis, 5.2% (3/58); liver cirrhosis, 11.4% (8/70); hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 12.1% (12/99). To elucidate the interaction of these two viruses in hepatocellular carcinoma, 128 HCC patients and 384 age-matched and sex-matched subjects were further analyzed. Eighty-seven of 128 HCC patients (68.0%) were only positive for HBsAg, 13 patients (10.1%) were only anti-HCV positive, and 12 (9.4%) were positive for both markers. The presence of HBsAg and anti-HCV was associated strongly with HCC. Moreover, the risk of HCC was significantly higher when both HBsAg and anti-HCV were present simultaneously. These results suggested that concurrent HCV infection might accelerate the progression of chronic HBV infection and may contribute to the pathogenesis of HCC in patients with chronic HBV infection."

The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of blood transmitted diseases among IDU in the Brod-Posavina County due to shared use of needle/syringe in outpatients and those treated in a therapeutic community, and to compare the results obtained. First, we analyzed data separately for hepatitis B and C, and then we selected patients with coinfection. The prevalence of HBsAg positive patients in both groups was significantly lower than the prevalence among drug addicts in Croatia (1.16% and 3.28% vs. 13.2%). Significant correlation was found in outpatients with anti-HBs+anti-HBc antibody (p < 0.05) between those who shared needles/syringes and those who did not. Significant correlation was also found among patients treated at therapeutic community (p < 0.01). Comparing the patients treated as outpatients and in therapeutic community, significant correlation was only found between vaccinated patients. HCV positive outpatients had lower and drug addicts in therapeutic communities significantly higher prevalence as compared with the prevalence of HCV among addicts in Croatia (41.86% and 60.66% vs. 44.6%). A significant correlation between those who shared needles/syringes and those who did not was found in both outpatients and patients treated in therapeutic community (P < 0.01). Comparison of HCV positive patients treated as outpatients and those in therapeutic community also yielded significant correlation (p < 0.05). The prevalence of HBV/HCV coinfection was similar in both groups of patients. Significant correlation (P < 0.05) was only found in the group of patients with anti HBC/anti HCV antibodies. There was no HIV-positive patient in any group. We also found a low prevalence of HBsAg/anti-HCV in both groups of patients (1.16% and 2.46%). Upon establishing a network of centers for the treatment of addicts, constant work on prevention and education, systematic testing and vaccination, and implementation of harm reduction programs, we noticed a trend of reducing the number of people with HBV and HCV in the younger population of addicts."

Patients were assessed for virological analysis at day 0 and weeks 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72. Correlation of HCV RNA and HCV CA at the initiation of treatment was excellent (r = 0.92). HCV RNA and CA kinetics were similar during follow-up of HCV treatment from day 0 to week 72 whatever the group of response and genotype. The positive and negative predictive values of response to the treatment at week 4 were 59 and 94%, respectively, for HCV RNA load reduction of >2 log and 54 and 94%, respectively, for HCV CA below the threshold value (4.18 log(10) pg/ml . 10(4)). Trak-C, a new assay able to quantify CA in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, correlates well with quantitative HCV RNA assays and is cheaper and easier to perform than molecular technology.

In this study, the prevalence of HGV-RNA and antibodies to E2 envelope antigen (anti-E2) which is a marker of past infection, have been investigated in the samples of patients with HCV and HBV infections, and the prevalence rates were compared with the control group. The study group consisted of 50 patients with HBV and 50 patients with HCV infections, who did not have any risk for parenteral transmission, and 60 healthy control subjects. Serum samples were tested for the presence of HGV-RNA by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for anti-E2 by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As a result, HGV-RNA and anti-HGV-E2 positivity rates in HBV and HCV infected patients were found as; 4% and 6%, 4% and 4%, respectively. Although the prevalence of HGV-RNA in patients with HBV and HCV infections were higher than the control group (1.66%), there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05). The prevalence of anti-E2 antibodies in patients with HBV and HCV infections did not revealed any difference in comparison to the control group (6.66%) (p>0.05). In conclusion, GBV-C/HGV infection prevalence was found low in patients with HBV and HCV infections, supporting that although parenteral route is the most effective way, other routes such as sexual contact and intra-familial contact may also play role in HGV transmission."

The risk factors associated with non-adherence were: if the patient was not concerned about ART, odds ratio (OR) = 3.47 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13-10.68); if they do not carry an extra dose of ART, OR = 6.63 (95% CI = 1.73-25.47); if a health-care worker taught them how to take ART, OR = 0.27 (95% CI = 0.08-0.93). Adherence among adolescents was higher than expected. Factors associated with lack of adherence were: interviewees being unaware of ARTs and lack of commitment to the treatment. Interventions involving these factors must be evaluated."

A cohort of HIV-infected adults in urban Peru was followed for a two-year period after ART initiation. ART adherence was measured using a 30-day self-report tool and classified as suboptimal if <95% adherence was reported. We conducted a repeated measures cohort analysis to examine whether food insufficiency was more common during months of suboptimal adherence relative to months with optimal adherence. 1,264 adherence interviews were conducted for 134 individuals. Participants who reported food insufficiency in the month prior to interview were more likely to experience suboptimal adherence than those who did not (odds ratio [O.R.]:2.4; 95% confidence interval [C.I.]:1.4, 4.1), even after adjusting for baseline social support score (O.R. per 5 point increase:0.91; C.I.:[0.85, 0.98]) and good baseline adherence self-efficacy (O.R.:0.25; C.I.:[0.09, 0.69]).

Combination therapy with 3 or more antiretroviral medications is currently widely recommended for treatment of children and adolescents with HIV infection. While potent regimens can initially reduce virus load to below assay quantitation limits in the majority of persons with HIV infection, 30% to 80% of children will have regimen failure and return of detectable plasma virus within 1 year. Adherence to therapy is critical to regimen success. Optimal treatment requires careful use of potent combinations of drugs, with attention to adherence, palatability, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics.

We calculate and compare HCV reinfection rates among HIV-positive MSM after spontaneous clearance and successful medical treatment of infection.
6312,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is associated with adrenal disorders, which must not be underestimated. Adrenal morphologic changes are primarily related to opportunistic infections, mostly by cytomegalovirus and mycobacteria, and malignant tumours such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. The most frequent biological alteration reported to date is the increases in cortisol concentrations which results from a decrease in cortisol metabolism and hyperactivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis commonly referred to as pseudo-Cushing's syndrome. These modifications can be a consequence of antiretroviral therapy and do not require any investigation or specific treatment. Conversely, adrenal insufficiency, either iatrogenic or secondary to glandular infiltration by neoplasms or infections, needs long-term substitution with hydrocortisone, but at present occurs more rarely and usually at late stages of disease progression. The impact of HIV infection on the other adrenocortical functions has been less reported in the literature although several studies show low levels of adrenal androgens, especially dehydroepiandrostenedione (DHEA). Impairment in mineralocorticoid function appears occasional and remains a subject of debate. "

These lesions are often associated with concentric intimal obliteration of pulmonary vessels. We report that the lungs of three patients with scleroderma-associated pulmonary hypertension showed a predominance of obliterative-concentric lesions, with relatively few plexiform or combined lesions. In contrast, plexiform lesions predominated in the lungs obtained from three patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated pulmonary hypertension; pure obliterative-concentric lesions were infrequent. Both plexiform and concentric obliterative lesions stained strongly positive for the endothelial cell marker factor VIII-related antigen. Muscle-specific actin immunostaining highlighted the smooth muscle cells of the tunica media of plexiform vessels, but not the luminal layers of the concentric-obliterative lesions. Proliferating cells, as determined by immunostaining with the MIB-1 antibody, were only detected in the plexiform vascular lesions. We postulate that concentric-obliterative lesions and plexiform lesions are temporally and etiologically related. A scaffolding of proliferating endothelial cells could be the common denominator of both lesions. Our hypothesis that there exists a chronological continuum, proceeding from early, proliferative plexiform lesions to late, nonproliferative concentric-obliterative lesions in primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension, may lead to better targeted treatment strategies and disease classification."

To understand the unknown region of drug sensitivity and treatment resistance, HBV quasispecies of whole genome during early period of NUC treatment was examined using ultra‑deep sequencing. Eleven patients with chronic HBV infection who received NUC treatment were enrolled in the current study. Viral DNA was extracted from serum samples before and early period of NUC treatment. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was subsequently performed on the DNA products. The viral quasispecies of the entire genome was analyzed by ultra‑deep sequencing. The regions and positions corresponding to the changes in the quasispecies were investigated before and early period of NUC treatment. The secondary structure changes were predicted by mutations/substitutions detected using Lasergene Protean v14.1 software. The frequency of quasispecies variants increased significantly in the polymerase domain from before to early period of NUC treatment (3.08±1.28 vs. 3.51±1.47%, P<0.008), particularly the reverse transcription (RT) domain (3.76±1.25 vs. 4.52±1.37%, P<0.012). In addition, increased variation detected from HBsAg domain showed statistically significant during NUC treatment (6.81±3.26 vs. 7.81±3.26%, P<0.040). The amino acid (aa) mutations/substitutions were detected and compared from before to early period of treatment. Interestingly, most of them were located in the RT region (RT1 motif: aa21‑aa51) and small S region in the early duration of NUC treatment. Furthermore, several mutation patterns, such as cI97L and cP130T showed alterations in the secondary structure and predicted antigenicity of HBV protein. Although the HBV whole genome can be affected by NUC treatment, RT 1 motif region and small S region are more sensitive to the early period of NUC treatment. This study suggested the initial changes of HBV quasispecies might affect the long‑term drug sensitivity and resistance to NUC treatment."

The study population comprised 28,522 black Southern African gold miners. Patients with sputum culture-positive new or recurrent pulmonary TB diagnosed in 1995 were prospectively enrolled in the cohort. Directly observed therapy (DOT) was practiced and outcomes were assessed at 6 mo after treatment was begun. There were 376 cases of TB (incidence 1,318 per 100,000), of which 190 (50%) were HIV positive and 82 (22%) had recurrent TB. There was no association between HIV status and history of previous TB or drug resistance. Neither the treatment interruption rate (2%) nor the rate at which patients transferred out of the treatment program (1.6%) were associated with HIV status. Excluding deaths, cure rates were similar for HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients (89% versus 88%), but significantly lower in those with recurrent than in those with new TB (77% versus 92%). Mortality was 0.5% in HIV-negative patients versus 13.7% in HIV-positive patients, and in the latter group was associated with CD4(+) lymphocyte depletion. Autopsy examination showed that in HIV-positive patients, early mortality was due to TB whereas late deaths were most commonly due to cryptococcal pneumonia. The study showed that a well-run TB control program can result in acceptable cure rates even in a population with a very high incidence of TB and HIV infection. Particular vigilance is needed for concurrent infections, which may contribute significantly to mortality during treatment of TB in HIV-positive patients."

A variety of host proteins interact with HCV proteins. The definitive role of cytoskeletal (CS) proteins in HCV infection remains to be determined. In this study, our aim was to determine the expression profile of differentially regulated and expressed selected CS proteins and their association with HCV proteins in infected hepatocytes as possible therapeutic targets. Using proteomics, qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence techniques, we revealed that filamin A (fila) and vimentin (vim) were prominently increased proteins in HCV-expressing human hepatoma cells compared with parental cells and in liver biopsies from patients with CHC vs controls. HCV nonstructural (NS) 3 and NS5A proteins were associated with fila, while core protein partially with fila and vim. Immunoprecipitation showed interactions among fila and NS3 and NS5A proteins. Cells treated with interferon-α showed a dose- and time-dependent decrease in CS and HCV proteins. NS proteins clustered at the perinuclear region following cytochalasin b treatment, whereas disperse cytoplasmic and perinuclear distribution was observed in the no-treatment group. This study demonstrates and signifies that changes occur in the expression of CS proteins in HCV-infected hepatocytes and, for the first time, shows the up-regulation and interaction of fila with HCV proteins. Association between CS and HCV proteins may have implications in future design of CS protein-targeted therapy for the treatment for HCV infection."

Animals that controlled plasma viremia following transient postinoculation treatment showed substantial resistance to subsequent intravenous rechallenge with homologous (SIVsmE660) and highly heterologous (SIVmac239) SIV isolates, up to more than 1 year later, despite the absence of measurable neutralizing antibody. In some instances, resistance to rechallenge was observed despite the absence of detectable SIV-specific binding antibody and in the face of SIV lymphoproliferative responses that were low or undetectable at the time of challenge. In vivo monoclonal antibody depletion experiments demonstrated a critical role for CD8(+) lymphocytes in the control of viral replication; plasma viremia rose by as much as five log units after depletion of CD8(+) cells and returned to predepletion levels (as low as <100 copy Eq/ml) as circulating CD8(+) cells were restored. The extent of host control of replication of highly pathogenic SIV strains and the level of resistance to heterologous rechallenge achieved following transient postinoculation treatment compared favorably to the results seen after SIVsmE660 and SIVmac239 challenge with many vaccine strategies. This impressive control of viral replication was observed despite comparatively modest measured immune responses, less than those often achieved with vaccination regimens. The results help establish the underlying feasibility of efforts to develop vaccines for the prevention of AIDS, although the exact nature of the protective host responses involved remains to be elucidated."

The objective of this article is to give an insight into the main NIs occurring in HIV-infected patients. Literature pertaining to NIs in HIV-infected patients was reviewed. According to the leading studies in the literature, the incidence of NI ranges from 7.9 to 15 per 100 admissions. Bloodstream infections are the most frequent infections, mainly due to intravascular catheters, followed by urinary and respiratory tract infections. Colonization seems to have an important role in the development of NIs among this immunocompromised population.

We administered a comprehensive Western neuropsychological (NP) test battery to 203 HIV+ and 198 HIV- former plasma donors in the rural area of Anhui province. They found that 26% of the HIV- samples, and 46% of the HIV+ samples, were infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), which can also have central nervous system (CNS) effects. To classify NP impairment, we developed demographically corrected test norms based upon individuals free of both infections (N=141). Using a global summary score, NP impairment was found in 34.2% of the HIV-monoinfected group and 39.7% of the coinfected group, as compared to 12.7% of the uninfected controls (P<.001). HIV+ participants with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were more likely to be impaired (43%) than non-AIDS individuals (29%; P<.05). Lastly, when all infection groups were combined, participants with NP impairment reported more cognitive complaints (P<.01) and increased dependence in everyday functioning (P=.01). In sum, NP impairment in this large rural Chinese sample was associated with both HIV and HCV infections, and the impairment's prevalence, severity, and pattern were similar to those reported by Western studies. Clinical significance of NP impairment in this population is suggested by the participants' reports of reduced everyday functioning. These findings indicate that HAND is likely to be an important feature of HIV infection in developing countries, underscoring the need for international efforts to develop CNS-relevant treatments."

The objective of this analysis was to compare the rate of suicidality among patients initiating efavirenz-containing versus efavirenz-free antiretroviral (ARV) regimens.This retrospective cohort study used US administrative claims data for commercially and Medicaid-insured individuals for the years 2006 to 2013. ARV-naive patients aged ≥12 years initiating an efavirenz-containing or efavirenz-free ARV regimen with ≥6 months of continuous insurance enrollment prior to ARV initiation were selected. The primary outcome was suicidality, defined as the occurrence of any medical claim with a diagnosis code for suicidal ideation or an inpatient or emergency department medical claim for suicide attempt. Unadjusted incidence rates were calculated and propensity score-adjusted hazard ratios were estimated to account for differences in patient characteristics.There were 19,983 patients (efavirenz-containing, n = 11,187; efavirenz-free, n = 8796) in the commercial database and 5154 patients (efavirenz-containing, n = 2224; efavirenz-free, n = 2930) in the Medicaid database. Unadjusted incidence rates (95% confidence interval [CI]) of suicidality per 1000 person-years were: commercial, efavirenz-containing (3.3 [2.4-4.4]), efavirenz-free (4.0 [2.7-5.8]); Medicaid, efavirenz-containing (25.7 [18.8-34.4]), efavirenz-free (40.6 [31.9-50.9]). In propensity score-adjusted analyses, efavirenz use was not associated with suicidality: adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) of suicidality compared with efavirenz-free regimen, commercial, 1.029 (0.636-1.665); Medicaid, 0.902 (0.617-1.319).This analysis found no conclusive evidence of an increased risk of suicidality among patients initiating an efavirenz-containing ARV regimen.

Little is known about the factors associated with patients' willingness to accept providers' recommended ART changes. This multicenter prospective observational study examined factors associated with willingness to accept ART changes recommended by their providers among HIV-infected adults from six urban outpatient HIV clinics. Patients were surveyed using the Patient Attitudes about Altering Antiretroviral Therapy Survey questionnaire (PAAARTS). Factors associated with willingness to accept ART changes were assessed using a multivariate generalized estimating equation (GEE) model to account for correlated responses. The Classification and Regression Trees (CART) analysis was also performed to determine subgroups of patients with higher acceptance of change. 216 of 289 patients (75%) definitely accepted recommended changes. Odds for acceptance were 3.2, 2.3, and 2.8 times higher for patients with higher attitudes and beliefs about ART (p < 0.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.59, 6.52), patients who rated their provider's care as excellent (p < 0.05; 95% CI = 1.07, 4.78), and non-Hispanic patients (p < 0.05; 95% CI 1.03, 7.57), respectively. CART analysis showed similar results and identified that when patients had less positive attitude about ART, acceptance rates were higher for non-Hispanic patients with higher assessments of their patient-provider communication. While most patients accepted providers' recommendation for ART changes, this willingness was influenced by both patients' attitudes and beliefs about ART and their assessment of either the effectiveness of patient-provider communication or their rating of providers' care. ART acceptance rates among Hispanic patients were lower."

The serum TNF-alpha concentrations in patients with chronic severe HBV infection were compared to those of 30 healthy controls by radioimmunoassay. The frequencies of the TNF1/2 genotype and the TNF2 allele were greater in patients with chronic severe HBV infection than in healthy controls (25% vs. 11.1%, p 0.015; 12.5% vs. 5.6%, p 0.036, respectively) and patients with chronic mild HBV infection and asymptomatic carriers (25% vs. 8.8%, p 0.011; 12.5% vs. 4.2%, p 0.015, respectively). Heterozygotes carrying the TNF2 allele had higher levels of serum TNF-alpha than homozygotes for the wild-type allele among all patients with chronic severe HBV infection (p <0.01). The genotype distribution and allele frequency of TNF-beta were similar for patients with chronic severe HBV infection and healthy controls, but the frequency of the TNF-beta*2/2 genotype in patients with chronic mild HBV infection and asymptomatic controls was lower than for healthy controls (9.9% vs. 22.4%, p 0.043) or patients with chronic severe HBV infection (9.9% vs. 26.8%, p 0.043), although this was not significant after correction for multiple testing.

We evaluated the kinetics of viral suppression, CD4+ T-cell restoration, gene expression, and HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in longitudinal gastrointestinal biopsy and peripheral blood samples from patients initiating HAART during primary HIV infection (PHI) or chronic HIV infection (CHI) using flow cytometry, real-time PCR, and DNA microarray analysis. Viral suppression was more effective in GALT of PHI patients than CHI patients during HAART. Mucosal CD4+ T-cell restoration was delayed compared to peripheral blood and independent of the time of HAART initiation. Immunophenotypic analysis showed that repopulating mucosal CD4+ T cells were predominantly of a memory phenotype and expressed CD11 alpha, alpha(E)beta 7, CCR5, and CXCR4. Incomplete suppression of viral replication in GALT during HAART correlated with increased HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. DNA microarray analysis revealed that genes involved in inflammation and cell activation were up regulated in patients who did not replenish mucosal CD4+ T cells efficiently, while expression of genes involved in growth and repair was increased in patients with efficient mucosal CD4+ T-cell restoration. Our findings suggest that the discordance in CD4+ T-cell restoration between GALT and peripheral blood during therapy can be attributed to the incomplete viral suppression and increased immune activation and inflammation that may prevent restoration of CD4+ T cells and the gut microenvironment."

In this study we aimed to examine the regulation of NGAL in HIV infection. The regulation of NGAL in HIV infection was examined by different experimental approaches, including studies in peripheral blood and mononuclear cells (MNC) from bone marrow aspirates before and during highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). We found that: before initiating HAART, HIV-infected patients (n = 37) had significantly decreased serum NGAL levels compared with healthy controls (n = 26); (ii) during HAART, there was a gradual and significant increase in NGAL concentrations reaching levels comparable to those in healthy controls after 12 months; (iii) this increase was seen primarily in virological responders to HAART (HIV RNA level <200 copies/ml after 24 months); (iv) phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated NGAL release in MNC cells from bone marrow aspirates was decreased in untreated HIV-infected patients compared with healthy controls, but increased after 26 weeks on HAART; and (v) there was a significant positive correlation between neutrophil counts and NGAL levels at all time-points during HAART. We have shown decreased NGAL levels in HIV-infected patients, potentially reflecting decreased number and function of neutrophils as well as impaired bone marrow myelopoiesis. These abnormalities were reversed by successful HAART. Our findings underscore further the involvement of neutrophils and innate immunity in HIV-related immunodeficiency."

The results were correlated with serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Our main findings were as follows. MBL levels and the capacity of complement activation by the MBL pathway were increased in HIV-infected patients with advanced clinical disease as shown in both cross-sectional analysis and longitudinal testing. There was no ""normalization"" of these parameters during HAART. In fact, MBL levels increased during therapy, and this increase was associated with a good virologic response. Although both MBL and CRP are regarded as acute-phase proteins, no correlation was seen between these proteins. Thus, the notably diverse patterns of MBL responses among patients with different clinical courses and treatments suggest that MBL and complement activation by the MBL pathway could be involved in the pathophysiology of HIV infection. It is not inconceivable that the net effects of MBL responses may vary in different clinical settings."

Viral clearance depends on the development of a successful cellular immune response against the virus. Interestingly, such a response is altered in chronically infected patients, leading to chronic hepatitis that can result in liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Among the mechanisms that have been described as being responsible for the immune suppression caused by the virus, Treg-cells (regulatory T-cells) are emerging as an essential component. In the present work we aim to study the effect of HCV-core protein in the development of T-cells with regulatory-like function. Using a third-generation lentiviral system to express HCV-core in CD4+ Jurkat T-cells, we describe that HCV-core-expressing Jurkat cells show an up-regulation of FOXP3 (forkhead box P3) and CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4). Moreover, we show that HCV-core-transduced Jurkat cells are able to suppress CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 stimulation."

Worldwide, ~750 million people are actively infected (viraemic) and an estimated 0.75-1.5 billion people have evidence of prior HPgV infection. No causal association between HPgV and disease has been identified; however, several studies described a beneficial relationship between persistent HPgV infection and survival in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The beneficial effect appeared to be related to a reduction in host immune activation. HPgV replicates well in vivo (mean plasma viral loads typically >1×107 genome copies ml-1); however, the virus grows poorly in vitro and systems to study this virus are limited. Consequently, mechanisms of viral persistence and host immune modulation remain poorly characterized, and the primary permissive cell type(s) has not yet been identified. HPgV RNA is found in liver, spleen, bone marrow and PBMCs, including T- and B-lymphocytes, NK-cells, and monocytes, although the mechanism of cell-to-cell transmission is unclear. HPgV RNA is also present in serum microvesicles with properties of exosomes. These microvesicles are able to transmit viral RNA to PBMCs in vitro, resulting in productive infection. This review summarizes existing data on HPgV cellular tropism and the effect of HPgV on immune activation in various PBMCs, and discusses how this may influence viral persistence. We conclude that an increased understanding of HPgV replication and immune modulation may provide insights into persistent RNA viral infection of humans. "

In this study, 92 samples from the Jewish population of Uzbekistan were investigated for the prevalence of GBV-C/HGV. GBV-C/HGV RNA was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using specific primers derived from the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR). Sequences were analyzed by a molecular evolutionary method. Of 92 samples, GBV-C/HGV RNA was detected in ten (10.9%), HCV RNA was present in two (2.2%), and HBsAg in eight (8.7%). HTLV-I and HIV infection was not detected. Single GBV-C/HGV infection was detected in eight (80%), and co-infection with HBV or HCV was detected in only two of the GBV-C/HGV infections. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were elevated in three (3.3%), but none with single GBV-C/HGV infection had an elevated ALT level. Nine people (90%) with GBV-C/HGV infection were distributed under the mean age of the population (P < 0.05). Molecular evolutionary analysis showed all GBV-C/HGV strains in this study were related to the HGV derived from the US. These results indicate that (1) GBV-C/HGV infection is highly prevalent among the Jewish population in Uzbekistan; (2) single GBV-C/HGV infections without persistent hepatitis are common; and (3) GBV-C/HGV infection is present among the younger generation."

The average participant reported becoming HIV infected through heterosexual transmission, was between 31 and 40 years old, had over ninth class standard education, was married, and generally had access to medical care; however, we obtained some qualitative data from various other risk categories. Trained ethnographers at the study site conducted in-depth interviews in the local language. These interviews were analyzed for content and ethnographic data. Almost all of the participants discussed the cost of ART as a barrier, with many reporting extended drug holidays, turning to family and/or friends, or taking drastic measures (i.e., selling family jewels, property) for financial assistance. Other barriers centered on privacy and stigma issues, such as disclosure of HIV inhibiting pill-taking and social support. Frequently discussed facilitators of adherence included perceived benefits of ART and proper adherence, perceptions about the consequences of nonadherence, and social support, if available. These data highlight the importance of reducing the cost of antiretroviral medications, involving family members in HIV care, and addressing privacy issues and stigma in counseling interventions in this setting."

The study used a cross-sectional correlational design. Adherence behaviour was assessed with the use of self-reports. Other scales assessed knowledge with HIV medication, coping, health locus of control, anxiety, depression and fatigue. A blood sample was also obtained to assess CD4+ counts and viral load. Sociodemographic characteristics and medical information were obtained from the medical records. A high adherence rate was found in this sample of 136 predominantly Chinese patients. There were only 13.7% of the patients being classified as non-adherent. Predictors of adherence included high self-efficacy in terms of being certain that the medication schedule will be followed all or most of the time as directed, low tension-anxiety scores, and low intensity of nausea and vomiting (R2=0.304). An expanded regression model revealed additional factors influencing adherence, including coping variables, pain and numbness in the hands and feet, age, disease stage, internal locus of control, fatigue, family support and taking medication twice daily. This model explained 49% of the variance in adherence. The results suggest that adherence is a multidimensional concept. Every effort should be made to assess in individuals those variables found to affect adherence and alter them whenever possible. Continuous support of patients and individualized medication programmes that will help patients adjust their treatment to their lifestyle are recommended."

It is well known that mother-to-child transmission of HIV can occur during pregnancy, delivery and postnatally through breastfeeding. The risk of transmission is related to maternal health, obstetric factors and infant prematurity. The management of pregnant women infected with HIV in Poland involves: recognizing HIV infection early by promoting HIV testing of all pregnant women; minimizing the risk of vertical transmission of HIV by using maternal antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and labour, followed by six weeks of neonatal zidovudine therapy and performing elective caesarean section. Adequate care requires also specialized laboratory monitoring and appropriate psychological and social support. Some modifications of standards in routine care of pregnant HIV seropositive women are necessary. For HIV infected women more attention to pre-conception counselling should also be paid."

What may be less well known are those health disparities related to common blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Several studies have shown that African-American and Hispanic injection drug users (IDU) have higher prevalence rates of these blood-borne pathogens, in addition to higher prevalence rates of HIV infection and AIDS cases. These blood-borne pathogens may contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality among African-American and Hispanic IDU, and perhaps also that of their sexual partners. This article reviews some of what is currently known about the epidemiology of HIV, AIDS, HBV, and HCV among African-American and Hispanic individuals, in general, and IDU in particular. In order to reduce or eliminate these health disparities a comprehensive approach is required that includes case finding, pre and post-test counseling, clinical treatment and management, and community-based behavioral or structural interventions."

In the present study, 158 women - all of whom met criteria indicative of HIV risk - were recruited in innercity primary healthcare clinics and administered measurements that assessed variables in three domains believed pertinent to HIV sexual risk behavior: (1) substance use in the past 3 months, (2) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-specific cognitive and attitudinal factors, including AIDS risk knowledge, condom attitudes, perceived risk for AIDS, behavior change intentions, and perceived self-efficacy, and (3) life context variables, including self-esteem, fatalism, personal optimism toward the future, and current life satisfaction. When women were categorized into highest and lower groups based on their recent risk behavior, AIDS-specific cognitive and attitudinal factors, as expected, differentiated the groups. However, women at highest risk for HIV also most often used a variety of substances and scored lower in self-esteem, held views more characterized by personal fatalism and low optimism concerning the future, and had greater life dissatisfaction than women at lower risk. HIV prevention programs for disadvantaged women require attention not only to AIDS-specific knowledge, attitudes, and skills development but also to broader issues of life context that, if unaddressed, may limit women's ability and motivation to reduce risk for HIV/AIDS."

CD4+ cell count, HIV-2 virus load, and clinical status were found to correlate well, providing evidence that HIV-2 virus load is useful in managing treatment of patients with HIV-2 who are receiving therapy. However, HAART regimens with predicted efficacy for treatment of HIV type 1 infection are not as efficacious for treatment of HIV-2. Controlled clinical trials of HIV-2-infected patients receiving various HAART regimens are needed to provide therapeutic guidance to the medical community."

The most common cause of chronic renal failure in HIV-1-seropositive patients is HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). HIVAN occurs almost exclusively in black patients and the majority of published cases are of patients who present with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This disease is currently the third leading cause of end-stage renal disease in blacks aged 20-64. Because HIV-1-seropositive patients may develop a wide variety of acute and chronic renal diseases, definitive diagnosis requires renal biopsy. Emerging data suggest a direct role of HIV-1 infection of kidney cells in the pathogenesis of HIVAN. There have been no well-controlled clinical trials in the treatment of HIVAN. The therapeutic agents with the most promise are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and antiretroviral medications. Long-term renal prognosis may be changing in the setting of improved aggressive antiretroviral therapy. Patient survival is determined primarily by the stage of HIV-1 infection. In this article, we present the case history of a patient who developed HIVAN. We then review the current literature concerning the epidemiology, differential diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of HIVAN."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of previous or current HEV infection in renal transplant patients. One hundred ninety-two kidney transplant patients were studied and classified in three groups: G1-infected with hepatitis B and/or C virus; G2-patients with elevated ALT; G3-patients with normal ALT and no hepatotropic virus infection. Demographic, epidemiologic and clinical characteristics were compared between the groups. Patients with HEV infection (previous or current) were also compared to those who tested negative for HEV. HEV infection was detected using serologic (anti-HEV IgG) and molecular (HEV RNA) methods. Anti-HEV IgG was positive in 28 (15%) while HEV RNA was positive in 20 (10%). When both markers were considered, 44 (23%) patients showed evidence of previous or current HEV infection. However, both markers were concomitantly positive in only four cases (2%). In the comparative analysis, patients infected with HBV and/or HCV showed lower frequency of anti-HEV IgG (P = 0.009). There was no difference regarding demographic, epidemiologic and laboratory variable between viremic and non-viremic patients. In conclusion, past and current infection with HEV was a frequent finding among renal transplant recipients. Actively infected patients (HEV RNA positive) did not present distinct demographic and epidemiological characteristics or laboratory alterations suggestive of underlying liver damage. Therefore, infection with HEV can only be detected in immunosuppressed patients by systematic investigation of HEV RNA."

We included 72 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected patients with plasma HIV RNA loads of <500 copies/mL for at least 3 months who then discontinued therapy for at least 12 weeks. The median CD4(+) T decay while off HAART was 16 cells/mm(3)/month (interquartile range, -6 to -34 cells/month). The mean follow-up after therapy ended was 45 weeks. The slope of the CD4(+) T cell decay was inversely correlated with the increase of CD4(+) T cells while receiving HAART, baseline virus load, CD4(+) T cell count at the time therapy was discontinued, age, and duration HIV RNA levels were undetectable. In a multiple regression analysis model, the increase of CD4(+) T cells while receiving therapy and age were independently associated with the rate of CD4(+) T cell loss."

To quantify the effectiveness of tailoring IFN dosage according to HCV viral load under treatment, we enrolled 41 patients (M/F 32/9) chronically coinfected by HCV and HIV with chronic liver disease. All were former i.v. drug addicts, with a mean age of 32+/-4 years, and had clinical and histological evidence of chronic hepatitis (10% with cirrhosis). The CDC stage was A1 in five, A2 in 14, A3 in eight, B2 in eight, B3 in three and C3 in three. Twenty four patients were on triple therapy with protease inhibitors, 11 were on two-drug anti-HIV regimens and three were untreated. IFN (alphan1 interferon) was started at 3 MU tiw and increased at 6 MU tiw at 4 weeks if serum HCV-RNA had not dropped by at least 50%. IFN was stopped at 24 weeks in non-responders. Eleven patients received a dose increase (total IFN dose at 24 weeks 396 MU), while 16 did not increase the initial dose (total IFN dose at 24 weeks 216 MU). Fourteen subjects stopped within the first weeks due to relapse of drug abuse (ten) or subjective intolerance (four). ALT and HCV-RNA levels were markedly decreased at week 4, and this reduction lasted up to 24 weeks. However only one patient had a complete biochemical and virological end-of-treatment response, which was maintained over a 24 weeks post-therapy follow-up. All other patients relapsed to baseline ALT and HCV-RNA values after stopping IFN. HIV viral load was slightly reduced under IFN therapy, while CD4 counts were unaffected. We conclude that raising the dose of IFN dose not eradicate HCV in most HIV-infected patients, even when HIV is well controlled by treatment. HCV viraemia and necroinflammation are temporarily suppressed by IFN, but the relevance of these surrogate endpoints to progression of liver disease and to survival cannot be assessed."

In response to HIV-1 the adaptive immune response is triggered, and antibody (Ab) production is elicited to block HIV-1 entry. We recently determined that dendritic cells (DCs) can efficiently capture Ab-neutralized HIV-1, restore infectivity, and transmit infectious virus to target cells. Here, we tested the effect of Abs on trans transmission of CCR5 or CXCR4 HIV-1 variants. We observed that transmission of HIV-1 by immature as well as mature DCs was significantly higher for CXCR4- than CCR5-tropic viral strains. Additionally, neutralizing Abs directed against either the gp41 or gp120 region of the envelope such as 2F5, 4E10, and V3-directed Abs inhibited transmission of CCR5-tropic HIV-1, whereas Ab-treated CXCR4-tropic virus demonstrated unaltered or increased transmission. To further study the effects of coreceptor usage we tested molecularly cloned HIV-1 variants with modifications in the envelope that were based on longitudinal gp120 V1 and V3 variable loop sequences from a patient progressing to AIDS. We observed that DCs preferentially facilitated infection of CD4(+) T lymphocytes of viral strains with an envelope phenotype found late in disease. Taken together, our results illustrate that DCs transmit CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 much more efficiently than CCR5 strains; we hypothesize that this discrimination could contribute to the in vivo coreceptor switch after seroconversion and could be responsible for the increase in viral load."

The findings demonstrate that rural adolescents have higher levels of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) knowledge, especially about risk-reduction strategies. However, rural adolescents also report higher rates of HIV-related sexual risk behaviors. Rural adolescents may not perceive the personal salience of practicing HIV risk-reduction behaviors thus increasing their risk for exposure to sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV infection. School-based HIV prevention programs developed for rural communities will need to enhance the personal salience of HIV for adolescents' and discourage their discounting of personal risk attributable to a lower prevalence of AIDS in the community. Physicians must become more actively involved in HIV prevention efforts by routinely assessing adolescent patient's sexual behavior and utilizing their clinical interaction to provide HIV education and promote the adoption of HIV risk-reduction behaviors."

Today, more and more heterosexual males, women, adolescents, and children have been infected with this lethal virus. This report addresses some of the psychiatric complications associated with HIV infection and discusses the diagnostic and clinical management challenges that clinicians must face as they deal with the increasing population of HIV-infected patients.

Studies in developing countries suggest an increasing incidence of HIV-associated cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS), especially in urban settings. Predictions indicate that the greatest increase in the prevalence of diabetes will occur in Africa over the next 2 decades due to lifestyle changes. This, coupled with increased access to HAART, may exponentially increase the prevalence of CMS in developing countries, where HIV infection is prevalent. Appropriate evaluation and intervention programs need to be implemented in the developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa, to curtail HIV-related CMS. This should include routine cardiovascular risk assessments, management of HIV infection with more ""metabolically friendly"" HAART, and encouragement of lifestyle modifications, particularly smoking cessation, weight management, regular exercise, and adherence to a healthy diet."

The advent and introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has made a significant impact on the course of infection. However, as patients are living longer, many HIV-associated illnesses are becoming prevalent among the infected population, especially those associated with chronic inflammation. Consistently, HIV-associated neuroinflammation is believed to be a major catalyst in the development of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), which are estimated to persist in approximately 50% of infected individuals regardless of cART. This dramatically underscores the need to develop effective adjunctive therapies capable of controlling this aspect of the disease, which are currently lacking.We previously demonstrated that the inflammatory mediator soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) is elevated in both the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of cognitively impaired infected individuals compared to their non-impaired infected counterparts. Our group, and others have recently demonstrated that there is an increasing role for this inflammatory mediator in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neuroinflammation, thereby identifying this molecule as a potential therapeutic target for the management of HAND. Platelets are the major source of circulating sCD40L, and these small cells are increasingly implicated in a multitude of inflammatory disorders, including those common during HIV infection. Thus, antiplatelet therapies that minimize the release of platelet-derived inflammatory mediators such as sCD40L are an innovative, non-traditional approach for the treatment of HIV-associated neuroinflammation, with the potential to benefit other HIV-associated illnesses.

Neuromuscular complications were found in 10 patients: 9 distal symmetric polyneuropathy, and 1 possible chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. In 3 patients with focal brain lesions, 2 were presumptively diagnosed as having primary CNS lymphoma, and 1 as having progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in the posterior fossa, based on history, clinical findings, serology, radiological appearances, and response to empirical therapy.

In spontaneous hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconverters, lower serum HBsAg and HBV DNA levels have been shown to be associated with HBsAg loss over time. However, little is known about their impacts on HBsAg loss in HBeAg-negative patients with limited viral replication. A total of 688 HBeAg-negative patients with baseline serum HBV DNA levels <2000 IU/mL were enrolled in Taiwan. The relationships of HBsAg and HBV DNA levels with subsequent HBsAg loss were investigated. In a mean follow-up of 11.6 years, the average annual rate of HBsAg loss was 1.6%. Baseline HBsAg and HBV DNA levels were inversely associated with subsequent HBsAg loss. When compared to patients who had HBsAg levels >1000 IU/mL, the rates of HBsAg loss were significantly higher in patients with HBsAg levels of 100-999, 10-99, and <10 IU/mL, with hazard ratios of 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-4.0), 2.8 (95% CI, 1.6-5.0), and 13.2 (95% CI, 8.1-21.5), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that HBsAg level, but not HBV DNA, remained as an independent factor. The adjusted hazard ratio of HBsAg loss was 13.2 (95% CI, 7.8-22.1) for HBsAg level <10 versus ≥ 1000 IU/mL.

Serum was analysed for HBsAg, antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), anti-HCV, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The seroprevalence was: 4.0% (39/985) for HBsAg, 17.2% (170/985) for anti-HBs, and 3.9% (38/985) for anti-HCV. The risk factors for hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection had little in common. Low socioeconomic status was a strong risk factor for HBsAg (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 18.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.35-139.50). In addition, the Chinese group has 2.97 higher risk of having HBV infection compared with the Malayan ethnic group (adjusted OR 2.97; 95% CI 1.22-7.83). There was moderate positive trend between family size and risk of HBsAg positivity (P = 0.130).

Besides the genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C19, hepatitis viruses (HV, including HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HEV, especially HBV and/or HCV) also account for the interpatient variability of the clinical course in PLC. This research covered the above two factors and divided the patients with PLC into two groups (one group with HBV infection and another without any HV infection) to find out whether the genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C19 have different effects in the progressing of PLC in different groups of patients. Eight hundred sixty-four cancer-free Han people (controls, named group 1), 207 Han PLC patients with HBV infection (group 2), and 55 Han PLC patients without any HV infection (group 3) were involved in this study. A wild-type allele (CYP2C19*1) and two mutated alleles (CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3) were identified. The frequencies of the mutant alleles and genotypes were then compared with each other. The frequencies of the homozygous and heterozygous variant genotypes (*2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3) in group 3 (25.5 %) were significantly higher than those in other groups (11.9 % in group 1 and 13.5 % in group 2, P = 0.014, 95 % confidence interval (CI)). The differences were statistically significant between group 1 and group 3 (P = 0.004, 95 % CI), but they were not statistically significant between group 1 and group 2 (P = 0.527, 95 % CI). Thus, we conclude that people which were not infected with HV but with the homozygous or heterozygous variant genotypes (*2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3) of CYP2C19 may have higher possibilities of getting PLC than people with other allelic genotypes (*1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3) (odds ratio (OR) = 2.523, 95 % CI = 1.329 ~ 4.788).

The rate of OE varied by occupation with 2.7% of firefighters, 3.2% of sheriff officers, 6.6% of corrections officers, and 7.4% of police officers reporting > or = 1 OE (P < 0.001). The HBV infection prevalence was 8.6%, and after adjustment for age and race, it was comparable to the overall US prevalence and did not vary by occupation. By multivariate analysis, HBV infection was not associated with any OEs, but it was associated with older age, being nonwhite, and a previous history of a sexually transmitted disease. This study demonstrated that although OEs are not uncommon among PSWs, HBV infection was more likely to be associated with nonoccupational risk factors. Administration of hepatitis B vaccine to PSWs early in their careers will prevent HBV infection associated with occupational and non-OEs."

Here we show that heterosexually acquired subtype A HIV-1 envelopes have signature sequences that include shorter V1-V2 loop sequences and fewer predicted N-linked glycosylation sites relative to the overall population of circulating variants. In contrast, recently transmitted subtype B variants did not, and this was true for cases where the major risk factor was homosexual contact, as well as for cases where it was heterosexual contact. This suggests that selection during HIV-1 transmission may vary depending on the infecting subtype. There was evidence from 23 subtype A-infected women for whom there was longitudinal data that those who were infected with viruses with fewer potential N-linked glycosylation sites in V1-V2 had lower viral set point levels. Thus, our study also suggests that the extent of glycosylation in the infecting virus could impact disease progression."

A total of 884 HIV-1 B subtype pol gene sequences from 306 drug-naïve (40 recently and 266 chronically infected) and 578 drug-treated HIV-1 infected patients were collected through routine drug-resistance testing between 2000 and 2008 in a single center (Division of Infectious Disease, Bergamo, Northern Italy). Bayesian phylogenetic tree was reconstructed and transmission clusters were recognized using a posterior probability as statistical support of each cluster. Differences among clustered and non-clustered drug-resistance mutations were assessed by Fisher's exact test. In our cohort we identified five clusters including ≥6 sequences with the root posterior probability of 100%. Dated phylogenies reconstructed through Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo model was possible for only two main clade (≥10 sequences) originated between 1990 and 2002. Among the 306 drug-naïve individuals, 12% carried a viral strain with at least 1 major mutation associated with transmitted drug resistance and 36% of these strains were involved in significant clusters. We report for the first time that many (34%) of HIV-1 subtype B transmission clusters identified in Italy were only composed by drug-naïve individuals and that the 14% of transmitted drug resistance was linked to transmission clusters composed only of newly diagnosed individuals. The phylogenetic analysis was performed on a large cohort of drug-naïve recently/chronically infected individuals where drug-experienced patients represent almost all infected individuals in a restricted geographical area. Our findings highlight the role of newly diagnosed individuals, not yet exposed to antiretroviral drugs, in the transmission of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains, providing new insights for the planning and management of treatment programs in developing countries."
3649,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"In sub-Saharan Africa, where the effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have been most devastating, there are multiple subtypes of this virus. The distribution of different subtypes within African populations is generally not linked to particular risk behaviors. Thus, Africa is an ideal setting in which to examine the diversity and mixing of viruses from different subtypes on a population basis. In this setting, it is also possible to address whether infection with a particular subtype is associated with differences in disease stage. To address these questions, we analyzed the HIV-1 subtype, plasma viral loads, and CD4 lymphocyte levels in 320 women from Nairobi, Kenya. Subtype was determined by a combination of heteroduplex mobility assays and sequence analyses of envelope genes, using geographically diverse subtype reference sequences as well as envelope sequences of known subtype from Kenya. The distribution of subtypes in this population was as follows: subtype A, 225 (70.3%); subtype D, 65 (20.5%); subtype C, 22 (6.9%); and subtype G, 1 (0.3%). Intersubtype recombinant envelope genes were detected in 2.2% of the sequences analyzed. Given that the sequences analyzed represented only a small fraction of the proviral genome, this suggests that intersubtype recombinant viral genomes may be very common in Kenya and in other parts of Africa where there are multiple subtypes. The plasma viral RNA levels were highest in women infected with subtype C virus, and women infected with subtype C virus had significantly lower CD4 lymphocyte levels than women infected with the other subtypes. Together, these data suggest that women in Kenya who are infected with subtype C viruses are at more advanced stages of immunosuppression than women infected with subtype A or D. There are at least two models to explain the data from this cross-sectional study; one is that infection with subtype C is associated with a more rapid disease progression, and the second is that subtype C represents an older epidemic in Kenya. Discriminating between these possibilities in a longitudinal study will be important for increasing our understanding of the role of specific subtypes in the transmission and pathogenesis of HIV-1."

This report provides healthcare providers with information for discussion with HIV-1-infected pregnant women to enable such women to make an informed decision regarding the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and use of elective cesarean delivery to reduce perinatal HIV-1 transmission. Various circumstances that commonly occur in clinical practice are presented, and the factors influencing treatment considerations are highlighted in this report. The Perinatal HIV Guidelines Working Group recognizes that strategies to prevent perinatal transmission and concepts related to management of HIV disease in pregnant women are rapidly evolving and will continually review new data and provide regular updates to the guidelines. The most recent information is available from the HIV/AIDS Treatment Information Service (available at http.//www.hivatis.org). In February 1994, the results of Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) Protocol 076 documented that ZDV chemoprophylaxis could reduce perinatal HIV-1 transmission by nearly 70%. Epidemiologic data have since confirmed the efficacy of ZDV for reduction of perinatal transmission and have extended this efficacy to children of women with advanced disease, low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts, and prior ZDV therapy. Additionally, substantial advances have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection and in the treatment and monitoring of persons with HIV-1 disease. These advances have resulted in changes in standard antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1-infected adults. More aggressive combination drug regimens that maximally suppress viral replication are now recommended. Although considerations associated with pregnancy may affect decisions regarding timing and choice of therapy pregnancy is not a reason to defer standard therapy. Use of antiretroviral drugs in pregnancy requires unique considerations, including the possible need to alter dosage as a result of physiologic changes associated with pregnancy the potential for adverse short- or long-term effects on the fetus and newborn, and the effectiveness of the drugs in reducing the risk for perinatal transmission. Data to address many of these considerations are not yet available. Therefore, offering antiretroviral therapy to HIV-1-infected women during pregnancy, whether primarily for HIV-1 infection, for reduction of perinatal transmission, or for both purposes, should be accompanied by a discussion of the known and unknown short- and long-term benefits and risks of such therapy to infected women and their infants. Standard antiretroviral therapy should be discussed with and offered to HIV-1-infected pregnant women. Additionally, to prevent perinatal transmission, ZDV chemoprophylaxis should be incorporated into the antiretroviral regimen."

Over a 6-month period, consecutive blood donors were screened for HBsAg, HBeAg, ALT and risk factors for HBV transmission. One hundred seventy-five adults (158 males, 17 females) were screened. Thirty-seven (21.3%) were HBsAg positive, 4 (2.3%) were HBeAg Positive and 17 (9.7%) had a raised ALT level, which ranged between 42-126 IU/L. All the HBeAg-positive subjects had raised ALT levels. The main risk factors among others, were scarification and indiscriminate injections. Twenty of the 37 HBsAg-positive subjects (54%) had no identifiable risk factor. The present study revealed that, HBeAg positivity among HBsAg positive blood donors was infrequent and whenever present was associated with active liver disease indicated by raised ALT value."
17535,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Abstract The purpose of this study was to determine if there was a connection between adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and use of risk reduction behaviors (RRB) in HIV-infected women who were prescribed antiretroviral therapy. The sample consisted of 193 predominately African American women with an average age of 44 who had been on ARV for approximately 9 years and had low annual incomes. All women were participating in a behavioral clinical trial focused on these dual outcomes. Using a risk index developed for this study, we examined the relationship of a composite of risk behaviors to electronically measured and self-reported adherence over the approximately 13-month study period. Women were categorized based on levels of adherence and risky behaviors, and we sought to determine if these classifications were associated with clinical outcomes of HIV viral load and CD4 counts. High levels of adherence were correlated with low risk behaviors (abstinence, consistent use of condoms, etc.). Those classified as high adherence and low-risk behavior (HALR) as well as those classified as high adherence and high-risk behavior (HAHR) had lower mean viral loads and higher CD4 counts than those in the other categories. Women in the low adherence and high-risk category (LAHR) had detectable viral loads and the lowest CD4 counts and are at higher risk for transmitting HIV to partners and unborn children. Our findings underscore the importance of addressing adherence to both ART and RRB in HIV clinical settings to improve clinical outcomes and reduce HIV transmission."

Despite a generally good response to effective antituberculous therapy, the prognosis remains poor. The objective of this analysis was to determine the independent predictors of survival in HIV-infected Ugandan adults with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. A total of 191 HIV-infected Ugandan adults with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were enrolled into a clinical trial of chemotherapy for tuberculosis. The subjects received either rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide for two months, followed by rifampin and isoniazid for six months (n = 101) or streptomycin, thiacetazone, and isoniazid for two months followed by thiacetazone and isoniazid for eight months (n = 90). After standard measurements were made at baseline, the group was followed at regular intervals for a mean of 16 months to determine survival. During the course of follow-up, 82 (43%) of the patients died, six within the first month of therapy. The one-year survival proportion was 68% with an estimated median survival of 26 months and did not differ according to treatment regimen. The hazard for death was biphasic, high early in the course of therapy, and then again after about one year. After controlling for the treatment regimen, four independent predictors of survival were found: anergy to purified protein derivative, atypical chest roentgenogram, previous HIV-related condition, and lymphopenia. In this cohort of Ugandan adults, four simple and inexpensive predictors of survival were found. These factors suggest that the degree of immunosuppression was a major determinant of survival."

We evaluated their implementation at four hospital-based HIV clinics in New York City in patients who initially met the CD4+ criterion for prophylaxis between January, 1995 and April, 1997. Medical records were reviewed at 6-month intervals to determine drugs prescribed. We identified 149 patients for the PCP sample, 130 for MAC, and 138 for toxoplasmosis. In the three samples, 91% were black and Hispanic, 75% to 81% were male, and 43% to 47% had a history of injection drug use (IDU); median age was between 39 and 40 years. PCP prophylaxis was prescribed during 93% of intervals and did not vary significantly by clinic or patient characteristics. Over the study period, MAC prophylaxis increased from 22% to 62%, and prescriptions for macrolides increased from 38% to 87% of all prescriptions. In the logistic regression analysis, prescription for MAC prophylaxis at any time during the study period was less likely in blacks compared with whites (odds ratio [OR] = .08; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .01, .52) and patients attending the clinic with the lowest rate of MAC prophylaxis (clinic D) compared with the clinic with the highest rate (clinic B; OR = .04; 95% CI = .01, .26). Toxoplasmosis prophylaxis was prescribed in 73% of intervals and did not differ significantly by antibody status (p = .42). Prescribing patterns were uniform across gender, HIV risk behavior, and age for PCP and MAC prophylaxis but differed by clinic and race for MAC prophylaxis. Trends in prophylaxis for opportunistic illnesses must continue to be monitored in light of the success of antiretroviral therapy in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV/AIDS."

Recent studies have shown that VCM exposure is associated with hepatocellular cancer. In Taiwanese studies, the majority of VCM-exposed workers with liver cancer had history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. To determine the role of HBV on the development of liver cancer in the VCM-exposed workers, we conducted a case-control study from a previously established polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cohort consisting of 4096 male workers from six PVC polymerization plants. A total of 18 patients with liver cancer, and 68 control subjects matched for age and specific plant of employment were selected. Detailed history of the participants that included alcohol consumption status, cigarette use, occupation, and family history of chronic liver disease were obtained using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. When the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative subjects without history of tank-cleaning were used as the reference, the HBsAg-negative subjects with history of tank-cleaning demonstrated a 4.0-fold greater risk of liver cancer (95% confidence interval: 95% CI = 0.2-69.1). The HBsAg carriers without history of tank-cleaning revealed a 25.7-fold greater risk of liver cancer (95% CI = 2.9-229.4). Whereas the HBsAg carriers with history of tank-cleaning revealed the greatest risk (matched odds ratio (ORm) 396.0, 95% CI = 22.6 -infinity) of developing liver cancer among subjects with different VCM-exposure status and HBsAg status categories. Further analysis showed the interaction term was significant (P < .01). Therefore, our results suggest an interaction between occupational VCM exposure and HBV infection for the development of liver cancer."

Recombinants between different HIV-1 group M subtypes are designated as CRF. The extension 'cpx', for complex, is given if the CRF consists of contributions from three or more different subtypes but the composition of the subtype is not given. The objective of this study was to present, for the first time an HIV-1 positive married couple infected with CRF06_cpx subtype in Izmir, Turkey. A 39-year-old male patient who admitted to hospital with the complaints of oral candidiasis and zona, was found to be anti-HIV positive. CD4+ T lymphocyte count was 21 cells/mm3 and plasma HIV-1 RNA level was 56.380 copies/ml. He reported unprotected heterosexual contact with multiple partners including African women during his stay in Saudi Arabia between 1996 and 2002. After his diagnosis, his 37-year-old wife was screened for HIV infection and she was also found anti-HIV positive, with CD4+ T cell count of 122 cells/mm3. However, her results of basal plasma HIV-1 RNA could not be obtained because of an internal control error. HIV-1 strains were analysed for subtyping, recombination and drug resistance mutations with pol gene region sequencing. HIV-1 sequences were subtyped as CRF06_cpx after phylogenetic analysis using neighbor-joining method. According to the recombination analysis, HIV-1 pol gene regions consisted of group M subtype G, A, D, and B in the male patient and G K, A, F, and D in the female patient. While L10I + L33F mutation associated with protease inhibitor (PI) resistance was detected in both of the patients, K219N mutation associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance was detected only in the male patient. In conclusion, HIV-1 molecular epidemiology studies are important tools for tracking transmission patterns and the spread of CRF. Global monitoring of CRF subtypes is also important to supply data for HIV vaccine development studies. On the other hand, the detection of HIV-1 primary resistance mutations in antiretroviral naive patients suggested that the resistance testing should be an integral part of the management of HIV infection."

We included 12 HIV- controls and 32 ART-naïve HIV patients who were randomized to efavirenz, maraviroc or maraviroc+raltegravir, each with fixed-dose tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine. Rectal and duodenal biopsies were obtained at baseline and at 9 months of ART. We performed a comprehensive assay of T-cell subsets by flow cytometry, T-cell density in intestinal biopsies, plasma and tissue concentrations of antiretroviral drugs by high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy, and plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), soluble CD14 (sCD14) and zonulin-1 each measured by ELISA. Total cell-associated HIV DNA was measured in PBMC and rectal and duodenal mononuclear cells. Twenty-six HIV-infected patients completed the follow-up. In the duodenum, the quadruple regimen resulted in greater CD8+ T-cell density decline, greater normalization of mucosal CCR5+CD4+ T-cells and increase of the naïve/memory CD8+ T-cell ratio, and a greater decline of sCD14 levels and duodenal HIV DNA levels (P = 0.004 and P = 0.067, respectively), with no changes in HIV RNA in plasma or tissue. Maraviroc showed the highest drug distribution to the gut tissue, and duodenal concentrations correlated well with other T-cell markers in duodenum, i.e., the CD4/CD8 ratio, %CD4+ and %CD8+ HLA-DR+CD38+ T-cells. Maraviroc use elicited greater activation of the mucosal naïve CD8+ T-cell subset, ameliorated the distribution of the CD8+ T-cell maturational subsets and induced higher improvement of zonulin-1 levels. These data suggest that combined CCR5 and integrase inhibitor based combination therapy in ART treatment naïve patients might more effectively reconstitute duodenal immunity, decrease inflammatory markers and impact on HIV persistence by cell-dependent mechanisms, and show unique effects of MVC in duodenal immunity driven by higher drug tissue penetration and possibly by class-dependent effects.

The current study assessed the associations between semen quality or serum hormone and concentration of the three heavy metal toxicants (lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and zinc (Zn)) in seminal, urine, and serum, and 50 HIV-infected men were recruited in the present study. Concentrations of Pb, Cd, and Zn were measured in three fluids by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Semen analyses were performed according to World Health Organization criteria. Serum samples were analyzed for follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone. HIV RNA viral load was determined by HIV virus loads kit. Spearman's rank correlations were used for correlation analyses. The results showed that the concentrations of Pb, Cd, and Zn were significantly correlated with semen quality and serum hormone. HIV-1 virus loads were significantly associated with increased seminal Pb. However, HIV-1 virus loads were not statistically associated with semen quality and serum hormone. Our findings suggested that environmental heavy metals had potential effects on reproductive parameters in HIV-infected men in China."
14927,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The domains of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein that are required for envelope function have been partially characterized. Little is known, however, about the nature of the interactions between these domains. To identify regions of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein that are involved in interactions necessary for proper envelope function, we constructed a series of 14 envelope recombinants between the env genes of two HIV-1 isolates. The envelope chimeras were examined for their ability to induce syncytia, to be proteolytically processed, and to function during a spreading viral infection. Our results demonstrate that the exchange between the two isolates of the first and second hypervariable regions (V1/V2) of gp120 results in defects in envelope glycoprotein processing, syncytium formation, and infectivity. Long-term passage of cultures infected with virus bearing a V1/V2 chimeric envelope glycoprotein leads to the emergence of a revertant virus with replication characteristics comparable to those of the wild type. Analysis of the revertant indicated that an Ile-->Met change in the C4 region of gp120 (between hypervariable regions V4 and V5) is responsible for the revertant phenotype. This single amino acid change restores infectivity without significantly affecting gp160 processing, CD4 binding, or the levels of virion-associated gp120. While the Ile-->Met change in C4 greatly enhances the fusogenic potential of the V1/V2 chimeric envelope glycoprotein, it has a detrimental effect on syncytium formation when analyzed in the context of the wild-type envelope. These results suggest that an interaction required for proper envelope glycoprotein function occurs between the V1/V2 and C4 regions of gp120."

To investigate the impact of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the immune profile of and microbial translocation in HIV-infected children, 60 HIV vertically infected children (31 without ART: HIV(+) and 29 with ART: ART(+)) and 20 HIV-uninfected children (HIV(-)) aged 2-12 years were recruited in Vietnam, and their blood samples were immunologically and bacteriologically analyzed. Among the HIV(+) children, the total CD4⁺-cell and their subset (type 1 helper T-cell (Th1)/Th2/Th17) counts were inversely correlated with age (all p < 0.05), whereas regulatory T-cell (Treg) counts and CD4/CD8 ratios had become lower, and the CD38⁺HLA (human leukocyte antigen)-DR⁺CD8⁺- (activated CD8⁺) cell percentage and plasma soluble CD14 (sCD14, a monocyte activation marker) levels had become higher than those of HIV(-) children by the age of 2 years; the CD4/CD8 ratio was inversely correlated with the plasma HIV RNA load and CD8⁺-cell activation status. Among the ART(+) children, the total CD4⁺-cell and Th2/Th17/Treg-subset counts and the CD4/CD8 ratio gradually increased, with estimated ART periods of normalization being 4.8-8.3 years, whereas Th1 counts and the CD8⁺-cell activation status normalized within 1 year of ART initiation. sCD14 levels remained high even after ART initiation. The detection frequency of bacterial 16S/23S ribosomal DNA/RNA in blood did not differ between HIV-infected and -uninfected children. Thus, in children, HIV infection caused a rapid decrease in Treg counts and the early activation of CD8⁺ cells and monocytes, and ART induced rapid Th1 recovery and early CD8⁺-cell activation normalization but had little effect on monocyte activation. The CD4/CD8 ratio could therefore be an additional marker for ART monitoring. "
14257,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The nucleocapsid (NC) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 consists of a large number of NC protein molecules, probably wrapping the dimeric RNA genome within the virion inner core. NC protein is a gag-encoded product that contains two zinc fingers flanked by basic residues. In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 virions, NCp15 is ultimately processed into NCp7 and p6 proteins. During virion assembly the retroviral NC protein is necessary for core formation and genomic RNA encapsidation, which are essential for virus infectivity. In vitro NCp15 activates viral RNA dimerization, a process most probably linked in vivo to genomic RNA packaging, and replication primer tRNA(Lys,3) annealing to the initiation site of reverse transcription. To characterize the domains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 NC protein necessary for its various functions, the 72-amino acid NCp7 and several derived peptides were synthesized in a pure form. We show here that synthetic NCp7 with or without the two zinc fingers has the RNA annealing activities of NCp15. Further deletions of the N-terminal 12 and C-terminal 8 amino acids, leading to a 27-residue peptide lacking the finger domains, have little or no effect on NC protein activity in vitro. However deletion of short sequences containing basic residues flanking the first finger leads to a complete loss of NC protein activity. It is proposed that the basic residues and the zinc fingers cooperate to select and package the genomic RNA in vivo. Inhibition of the viral RNA binding and annealing activities associated with the basic residues flanking the first zinc finger of NC protein could therefore be used as a model for the design of antiviral agents."
2014,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Respiratory viruses, particularly influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses, are ubiquitous pathogens among humans, especially among young children. However, relatively little is known about the impact of these common infections on individuals with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A review of the literature identifies three key areas that need further exploration. First, moderate-to-severe and even fatal lower respiratory viral illnesses in HIV-infected individuals have been reported. In general, the clinical presentation of these respiratory viral infections in persons with HIV infection is similar to their presentation in individuals without HIV infection. The major exception is the occurrence of fulminant, and often fatal, disseminated adenovirus infection in adults and children with HIV disease. Despite these reports, no information is available regarding the frequency of moderate-to-severe respiratory viral illnesses in individuals with HIV infection. Epidemiologic studies of respiratory viral illnesses in cohorts of HIV-infected adults and children are needed. Second, prolonged shedding of respiratory viruses for weeks and even months has been documented in HIV-infected adults and children. The frequency of prolonged shedding in this population has not been well defined, but data from a small newborn cohort study suggest that, at least for RSV, prolonged shedding is common. Prolonged respiratory viral shedding has implications for infection control in medical facilities where HIV-infected individuals are treated and in nursing homes, child care centers, and group foster homes that provide care for HIV-infected individuals. Therapies to help eliminate these chronic viral infections should be explored. Finally, indirect evidence suggests that respiratory viral infection may result in changes in HIV replication and, theoretically, HIV disease progression. Increased HIV-1 replication has been demonstrated in vitro in T lymphoma cells exposed to genetic material from adenovirus. Increased HIV replication in peripheral blood from adults following inactivated influenza vaccination has been reported. The impact of natural respiratory viral infection (and perhaps vaccination against these pathogens) on HIV replication and disease progression will be an important area of study."

The report also presents estimates and projections of the prevalence of persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who have CD4+ T-lymphocyte (T-cell) counts < 200/microL and who have not been diagnosed with a condition listed in the 1987 AIDS surveillance definition. These estimates and projections are used to predict the effect of expanding the AIDS surveillance definition to include all HIV-infected persons with a CD4+ T-cell count < 200/microL. Approximately 58,000 persons were diagnosed with AIDS in the United States during 1991. During the period 1992-1994, the number of persons newly diagnosed with AIDS is expected to increase by at most a few percent annually, with approximately 60,000-70,000 persons diagnosed per year. Although AIDS diagnoses among homosexual and bisexual men and among injecting drug users are projected to reach a plateau during this period, the number of AIDS diagnoses among persons whose HIV infection is attributed to heterosexual transmission of HIV is likely to continue to increase through 1994. The number of living persons who have been diagnosed with AIDS is expected to increase from approximately 90,000 in January 1992 to approximately 120,000 in January 1995. There is, however, considerable uncertainty in these projections. For example, the plausible range for the number of persons initially diagnosed with AIDS in 1994 is 43,000-93,000. CDC estimates that, as of January 1992, 115,000-170,000 U.S. residents had severe immunosuppression (a CD4+ T-cell count < 200 cells/microL without a diagnosis of AIDS in an HIV-infected person). Only about 50,000 of these persons were receiving medical care for HIV-related conditions and were known to have a CD4+ T-cell count < 200 cells/microL. The number of persons with severe immunosuppression is expected to increase to 130,000-205,000 by January 1995, with the actual number more likely to be in the lower half of this range than the upper half. The expanded AIDS surveillance definition, which includes severe immunosuppression, is predicted to result in an increase of approximately 75% in the number of persons reported during 1993, but an increase of < 20% in 1994 compared with the number of persons who would have been reported had the definition not been changed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

HIV-infected subjects with a history of weight loss (n = 17, mean weight loss 14.9 +/- 3.2 kg), asymptomatic HIV-seropositive subjects with normal CD4 T-cell counts (n = 7) and healthy HIV seronegative controls (n = 11) were studied. Hepatic lipogenesis was determined by infusion of [2-13C]-acetate, using the recently described xenobiotic probe technique with mass isotopomer analysis. Hepatic acetyl-coenzyme A enrichment was measured by high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry of secreted sulfamethoxazole-acetate, with measurement of incorporation into very low density lipoprotein-fatty acids by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Circulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interferon alpha (IFN alpha), insulin, and triglycerides were measured concurrently, and 7-day weighed food records were performed. De novo hepatic lipogenesis was increased 3- to 4-fold in HIV-infected subjects with weight loss compared to normal controls (P < 0.05 for palmitate and stearate in both overnight-fasted and fed states), and was also significantly increased in asymptomatic HIV seropositive subjects. Circulating TNF and IL-1 were not measurable in any subject (detection limit 2 pg/ml for IL-1 and 20 pg/ml for TNF). Serum IFN alpha was measurable in 11 out of 17 subjects with wasting and correlated significantly with de novo lipogenesis in overnight-fasted but not fed states. Serum IFN alpha was unmeasurable in asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects despite elevated lipogenic rates. Serum triglyceride concentrations were elevated in subjects with weight loss (2.09 +/- 0.28 mmol/L) and asymptomatic HIV-positives (1.34 +/- 0.34 mmol/L) in comparison to controls (0.67 +/- 0.08 mmol/L), and correlated with lipogenesis. Food intake correlated inversely with lipogenesis in the overnight-fasted state. We conclude that HIV infection is characterized by abnormal fat anabolism. This applies to subjects with reduced lean body mass and to asymptomatic HIV-positive subjects with normal T-cell counts. The former observation may have implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of the wasting syndrome. The latter observation is consistent with activation of the immune response and a state of viral nonlatency in early HIV disease."

Proliferative responses were assessed against rgp160, rp24, and a panel of recall antigens and mitogens. Despite good reactivity to recall antigens, at baseline approximately 33% had proliferative responses to gp160, and approximately 42% showed p24 gag responses. There was no statistical difference between vaccine and placebo groups for antigens or mitogens. After 1 year, approximately 73% of the subjects in the vaccine arm had new or boosted responses to gp160, versus approximately 18% in the placebo arm. Statistical significance was maintained throughout the study. Recurrent vaccination with recombinant gp160 was proven to be persistently immunogenic, increasing significantly the ability of HIV-1-infected persons to mount new proliferative responses to the vaccine."

We used a quantitative homoduplex tracking assay to compare the overall genetic composition of HIV-1 quasispecies in each transmission pair and to track the transmitted viruses during the acute and asymptomatic stages of HIV-1 infection. In the chronically infected transmitters, HIV-1 variants in genital secretions differed from those in blood and variants in cells differed from those in cell-free plasma, indicating remarkable sequence heterogeneity in these subjects as well as compartmentalization of the virus in different bodily sites. Conversely, two of five seroconvertors had only a few related variants and three of five harbored only one viral population, indicating that in these subjects the transmitted viruses were typically homogeneous. Transmitted viruses were evident in the donor's seminal plasma (one of five cases) and even more so in their seminal cells (three of five cases), suggesting that both cell-associated and cell-free viruses can be transmitted. In every pair studied, the transmitted variant(s) represents only a minor population in the semen of the corresponding transmitter, thereby providing evidence that HIV-1 selection indeed occurs during sexual transmission."

However, little is known about TDR among men who have sex with men (MSM) patients in China. In addition, TDR prevalence among patients with acute HIV infection (AHI) or early HIV infection (EHI) was believed higher than that of patients with chronic HIV infection (CHI), but as AHI is typically either unidentified or crudely defined in large populations, very few direct comparisons have been made. We did a retrospective analysis of TDR in 536 antiretroviral-naive MSM patients from our immunodeficiency clinics at You'an Hospital, Capital Medical University (CMU), in Beijing, China, 2008-2011. The cohort included 266 patients with AHI/EHI and 270 patients with CHI. We analyzed the subtype, estimated the TDR prevalence, and characterized the model of TDR and the predicted drug sensitivity. Additionally, we made a comparison of TDR between the patients with AHI/EHI and patients with CHI. Our results indicated that among the 536 patients, HIV-1 subtype CRF01_AE accounted for 52.1%, subtype B accounted for 24.8%, CRF07_BC/ CRF08_BC accounted for 21.6% (116/536), and 1.3% were denoted as unique recombinant forms (URFs). A total of 7.8% patients had one or more transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance mutations, representing 6.2% for PI-related mutations, 0.9% for NRTI-related mutations, and 1.7% for NNRTI-related mutations. Although patients with AHI/EHI had a higher TDR prevalence as compared to that of patients with CHI, the difference was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference in TDR model and predicted drug susceptibility between the two groups of patients either. This study provides important strategic information for public health planning by healthcare officials in China and warrants a comprehensive study with larger patient cohorts from various healthcare centers within China."

However, the long term effects of single-agent therapy administered only during the acute stage of infection (interrupted treatment) remain largely uncharacterized. In this study we provide longitudinal data using the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) model for HIV infection. Infected cats were treated with a prophylactic single-agent therapy, Fozivudine tidoxil (FZD), for six weeks, starting one day before infection. The initial acute infection study, reported elsewhere, demonstrated a decrease in plasma- and cell-associated viremia at two weeks post-infection (PI) in FZD-treated cats as compared to placebo-treated cats. We hypothesized that this early alteration in plasma- and cell-associated viremia would alter the virus set point and ultimately affect the outcome of chronic infection. Here we provide data at one, two and three years PI for plasma- and/or cell-associated viremia, total lymphocyte counts and CD4:CD8 ratios. There was no difference in viremia or cell counts between treated and nontreated groups at all time points tested. Contrary to our hypothesis, these results suggest that treatment with a single agent anti-retroviral drug during acute lentivirus infection does not significantly alter viral load and immune function during the chronic, asymptomatic stage of infection."

All consecutive women attending a single, tertiary care clinical site were offered free screening for sexually transmitted infections and genital disorders every 6-12 months. Candidal vaginal colonization was defined as a positive culture for Candida spp. in an asymptomatic woman. From January 1998 to July 2002 we analysed 214 women. The baseline prevalence of candidal vaginal colonization was 16.8%. In the logistic regression analysis, the time since HIV infection > or =36 months (odds ratio [OR] = 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.016-0.53, P = 0.002) and a plasma viral load > or =10,000 copies/mL (OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.03-14.9, P = 0.045) were independently associated with candidal colonization. Among 130 women who were followed for a mean period of 24 months, the incidence of vaginal colonization was 10.7/100 women-years. In the Cox regression analysis, a CD4(+) T-lymphocytes count <100 cells/microL during the follow-up was associated with an increased risk of candidal vaginal colonization (OR = 4.45, C.I. = 1.20-16.81, P = 0.03). Risk of candidal vaginal colonization episodes in HIV-infected women significantly increase when CD4(+) T-lymphocytes are less than 100."

The prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection is particularly high among persons who have used injection drugs; however, more recently, sexual transmission of HCV has been recognized among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM). Over the past decade, the effectiveness of HIV treatment improved substantially, leading to a substantial reduction in HIV/AIDS-related deaths; in this context, liver disease due to HCV infection has emerged as major concern for co-infected patients. Over the same period, treatment of HCV remained stagnant, with pegylated interferon alfa (PegIFN) plus ribavirin (RBV; PegIFN/RBV) entrenched as the standard treatment for HCV infection for co-infected patients, who have the greatest risk for liver disease. However, the effectiveness of HCV treatment in this population has been disappointing because of low rates of treatment initiation and success. In 2011, novel HCV NS3/4A PIs (PIs), telaprevir and boceprevir, were approved for use in combination with PegIFN/RBV for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection; at the time of approval, important questions regarding the efficacy, safety, and potential for drug interactions with telaprevir and boceprevir had not been answered. More recently, data from drug-interaction studies and 2 small, phase II clinical trials indicate that these HCV treatment regimens may lead to higher rates of HCV eradication in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, with manageable toxicity and pharmacologic interactions with antiretroviral drugs. As such, these HCV PI-based regimens have emerged as the standard for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection in carefully selected HIV-infected patients."

These are bloodborne pathogens transmitted through similar routes; for example, via injection drug use (IDU), sexual contact, or from mother to child during pregnancy or birth. In some settings, the prevalence of coinfection with HBV and/or HCV is high. In the context of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), liver disease has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected persons. Further, coinfection with viral hepatitis may complicate the delivery of ART by increasing the risk of drug-related hepatoxicity and impacting the selection of specific agents (e.g., those dually active against HIV and HBV). Expert guidelines developed in the United States and Europe recommend screening of all HIV-infected persons for infection with HCV and HBV and appropriate management of those found to be chronically infected. Treatment strategies for HBV infection include the use of nucleos(t)ide analogues with or without anti-HIV activity and/or peginterferon alfa (PegIFN) whereas HCV treatment is limited to the combination of PegIFN and ribavirin (RBV). Current approaches to management of HIV-infected persons coinfected with HBV or HCV are discussed in this review."

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) has emerged as a threat to the survival of individuals harboring both HCV and HIV, due to high prevalence and aggressive disease course. The HCV/HIV coinfection epidemic has been driven by people who inject drugs (PWID), although incident HCV is rising among HIV-infected men who have sex with men in the absence of drug injection. Coinfected individuals warrant aggressive treatment of both viruses; although early ART initiation is recommended to reduce the rate of liver disease progression, the most effective way to decrease HCV-related morbidity and mortality in coinfection is to achieve HCV viral eradication. Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents will soon revolutionize HCV treatment. Clinical data are needed regarding the efficacy of DAAs in coinfected PWID. Drug-drug interaction studies between ART, DAAs, and opiate substitution therapy must be expedited. Coinfected PWID should have equitable and universal access to HIV/AIDS, HCV, and addiction prevention, care, and treatment. Essential basic steps include improving screening for both infections and engaging coinfected PWID in HIV and HCV care early after diagnoses. Developing strategies to expand access to HCV therapy for coinfected PWID is imperative to stem the HCV epidemic and limit the morbidity and mortality of those at greatest risk for HCV disease progression. The ultimate goal must be the elimination of HCV from all coinfected PWID. "

Most of the HTLV-infected people live in geographic areas where the virus is endemic, as it happens in Brazil. The aim of this study was to identify HTLV prevalence and risk factors in HIV-positive patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 580 HIV-positive patients (mean age of 40.6 years and 45.0% men) from a specialized HIV/AIDS diagnosis and treatment center in Southern Brazil. Sociodemographic data, HIV risk factors, and HTLV-1/2 antibodies were collected. HTLV proviral DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors for HTLV infection. HTLV antibodies were detected in 29 (5.0%) and HTLV provirus in 17 (2.9%) patients. HTLV-1 was identified in 11 (64.7%) patients and HTLV-2 in 6 (35.3%) patients. No significant differences were observed between mono and coinfected patients in clinical characteristics regarding HIV/AIDS (time since HIV diagnosis, HIV viral load, lymphocytes CD4(+) count, and use of highly active antiretroviral therapy). Blood transfusion history was significantly associated with HIV/HTLV coinfection (p=0.039). Alcohol abuse was more prevalent in HTLV-positive (47.1%) than in HIV mono-infected patients (20.4%; p=0.008). Tattooing was the only risk factor independently associated with HIV/HTLV coinfection (p=0.035). This information contributes to an understanding of the epidemiology of HIV/HTLV coinfection in Brazil."
13107,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"In successful antiviral therapy of hepatitis B, drug combinations, particularly combinations without cross-resistance, can delay or prevent the emergence of drug-resistant mutants. Because drug-resistant mutants are archived and may limit future therapeutic options, prevention is important for long-term therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, combining drugs may achieve synergistic or additive antiviral effects compared with single drug therapy. Undesirable aspects of combination therapy include higher treatment costs and possibly lower adherence rates (due to pill number or complexity of regimen). Potentially harmful effects of combination therapy include higher rates of side effects, reduced efficacy due to drug competition, and the risk of multidrug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) if combination therapy is insufficient to prevent resistance. Combination therapy has been shown to reduce the rate of drug resistance in chronic hepatitis B, but only when drugs with a low barrier to resistance are used (lamivudine, adefovir). Combination therapies may achieve greater degrees of HBV DNA suppression, but this has not been associated with higher rates of seroconversion (hepatitis B e antigen or hepatitis B surface antigen) compared to single drug therapy. The benefit of combination therapy has yet to be demonstrated with agents that are associated with a high barrier to resistance (tenofovir, entecavir). The use of combination therapy is recommended in specific patient groups: those with decompensated cirrhosis, those coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus and HBV who are on antiretroviral therapy, those who have undergone liver transplantation, and those with drug-resistant HBV infection. There is insufficient evidence to recommend combination therapy as first-line therapy for all patients with chronic hepatitis B."

In this study we evaluated the relation of immunological parameters, virus load, clinical stage, and wasting to several parameters of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system in 76 patients with HIV infection, of whom 37 had developed acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). A subgroup of 26 untreated patients was followed during longitudinal testing, while the effects of antiretroviral therapy were evaluated in 34 patients (nucleoside analogs in 9, nucleoside analogs in combination with protease inhibitors in 25). Twenty healthy sex- and age-matched controls were analyzed for comparison. IGF-II was decreased (P = 0.03) and IGF-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) and IGFBP-3 protease activity were increased (P < 0.001) in AIDS patients compared with other HIV-infected individuals and controls. Plasma levels of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 protease activity correlated positively to virus load (P < 0.001) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P < 0.025) and negatively to CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell counts (P < 0.001). AIDS patients with wasting (n = 13) had lower IGF-II levels (P = 0.001) and higher IGFBP-2 levels (P = 0.001) than other AIDS patients. Although no significant change in any of the IGF-parameters was observed in patients during antiretroviral therapy, patients with elevated IGFBP-3 protease activity before therapy (5 of 34) all had a decrease during treatment. During longitudinal testing in patients followed without antiretroviral therapy, disease progression was associated with increases in IGFBP-3 protease activity and IGFBP-2 levels. Our results reveal several alterations in the IGF system during HIV infection with decreased IGF-II levels, increased concentration of IGFBP-2, and an increased IGFBP-3 protease activity in advanced disease."

However, prolonged treatment is associated with drug-induced toxicity, emergence of drug-resistant viral strains, and financial constraints. Structured therapeutic interruptions (STIs) have been proposed as a strategy that could boost HIV-specific immunity, through controlled exposure to autologous virus over limited time periods, and subsequently control viral replication in the absence of ART. Here, we analyzed the impact of repeated STIs on virological and immunological parameters in a large prospective STI study. We show that: (i) the plateau virus load (VL) reached after STIs correlated with pretreatment VL, the amount of viral recrudescence during the treatment interruptions, and the off-treatment viral rebound rate; (ii) the magnitude and the breadth of the HIV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte response, despite marked interpatient variability, increased overall with STI. However, the quantity and quality of the post-STI response was comparable to the response observed before any therapy; (iii) individuals with strong and broad HIV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses at baseline retained these characteristics during and after STI; (iv) the increase in HIV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte frequencies induced by STI was not correlated with decreased viral set point after STI; and (v) HIV-specific CD4(+) T lymphocyte responses increased with STI, but were subsequently maintained only in patients with low pretreatment and plateau VLs. Overall, these data indicate that STI-induced quantitative boosting of HIV-specific cellular immunity was not associated with substantial change in viral replication and that STI was largely restoring pretherapy CD8(+) T cell responses in patients with established infection."

A total of 593 and 601 proteins were identified in the pooled saliva samples from 5 HIV-1 subjects and 5 controls, respectively. Forty-one proteins were found to be differentially expressed. Bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed salivary proteins showed an increase of antimicrobial proteins and decrease of protease inhibitors upon HIV-1 infection. To validate some of these differentially expressed proteins, a high-throughput quantitation method was established to determine concentrations of 10 salivary proteins in 40 individual saliva samples from 20 seropositive patients before HAART and 20 seronegative subjects. This method was based on limited protein separation within the zone of the stacking gel of the 1D SDS PAGE and using isotope-coded synthetic peptides as internal standards. The results demonstrated that a combination of protein profiling and targeted quantitation is an efficient method to identify and validate differentially expressed salivary proteins. Expression levels of members of the calcium-binding S100 protein family and deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 protein (DMBT1) were up-regulated while that of Mucin 5B was down-regulated in HIV-1 seropositive saliva samples, which may provide new perspectives for monitoring HIV-infection and understanding the mechanism of HIV-1 infectivity."

As community stakeholders with basic healthcare training, community health workers (CHWs) are uniquely positioned to provide healthcare and insight into potential strategies to improve HIV treatment outcomes. The study goal was to qualitatively explore the self-perceived role of the CHW, unmet CHW needs, and strategies to improve HIV care in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Focus groups were conducted in May-August 2014, with 21 CHWs working in Msinga subdistrict. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated from Zulu into English. A hybrid deductive and inductive analytical method borrowed from grounded theory was applied to identify emergent themes. CHWs felt they substantially contributed to HIV care provision but were inadequately supported by the healthcare system. CHWs' recommendations included: (1) sufficiently equipping CHWs to provide education, counseling, social support, routine antiretroviral medication, and basic emergency care, (2) modifying clinical practice to provide less stigmatizing, more patient-centered care, (3) collaborating with traditional healers and church leaders to reduce competition with ART and provide more holistic care, and (4) offsetting socioeconomic barriers to HIV care. In conclusion, CHWs can serve as resources when designing and implementing interventions to improve HIV care. As HIV/AIDS policy and practice evolves in South Africa, it will be important to recognize and formally expand CHWs' roles supporting the healthcare system."

Two in-depth interviews were held with 38 PLWH (20 women, 18 men) selected from three government and nongovernment antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery sites in Wakiso District, and the narratives analyzed. ART providers played an important role in shaping participants' HIV self-management processes. Health workers helped PLWH realize that they could control their condition, provided useful concepts and language for emotional coping, and gave advice about practical self-management tasks, although this could not always be put into practice. ART providers in this setting were spaces for the development of a collective identity and a particular form of therapeutic citizenship that encouraged self-management, including adherence to ART. Positive framing institutions are important for many PLWH in resource-limited settings and the success of ART programs. "

In-depth interviews were conducted with PLHIV who were offered treatment but declined (n=37), ART staff (n=5), faith healers (n=5), herbal medicine providers (n=5), and home-based care providers (n=5). One focus group discussion with lay HIV counselors and observations in the community and at an ART clinic were conducted. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated, coded using Atlas ti, and analyzed using latent content analysis. Lack of self-efficacy, negative perceptions of medication, desire for normalcy, and fear of treatment-induced physical body changes, all modulated by feeling healthy, undermined treatment initiation. Social relationships generated and perpetuated these health and treatment beliefs. Long waiting times at ART clinics, concerns about long-term availability of treatment, and taking strong medication amidst livelihood insecurity also dissuaded PLHIV from initiating treatment. PLHIV opted for herbal remedies and faith healing as alternatives to ART, with the former being regarded as effective as ART, while the latter contributed to restoring normalcy through the promise of being healed. Barriers to treatment initiation were not mutually exclusive. Some coalesced to undermine treatment initiation. Ensuring patients initiate ART requires interventions at different levels, addressing, in particular, people's health and treatment beliefs, changing perceptions about effectiveness of herbal remedies and faith healing, improving ART delivery to attenuate social and economic costs and allaying concerns about future non-availability of treatment."

The Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) is a complex sample survey of HIV-infected adults receiving medical care in the United States. We used weighted interview and medical record data collected 06/2009 to 05/2012 to estimate the prevalence of ART use and viral suppression among gender-stratified racial/ethnic groups. We used χ² tests to identify significant differences in outcomes between white men versus other groups, and logistic regression models to identify the most parsimonious set of factors that could account for each observed difference. We found no significant disparity in ART use between white and Hispanic men, and no disparities between white men and white and Hispanic women after adjustment for disease stage, age, and poverty. Disparities in ART use between white men and black persons persisted after adjusting for other factors, but the observed differences were relatively small. Differences in ART use and adherence, demographic characteristics, and social determinants of health such as poverty, education, and insurance accounted for the observed disparities in viral suppression between white men and all groups except black men. In our model, accounting for these factors reduced the prevalence difference in viral suppression between white and black men by almost half. We found that factors associated with disparities differed among men and women of the same race/ethnicity, lending support to the assertion that gender affects access to care and health status among HIV-infected patients. In addition to supporting efforts to increase ART use and adherence among persons living with HIV, our analysis provides evidence for the importance of social determinants of health in understanding racial/ethnic and gender differences in ART use and viral suppression."

The program is based on intervention mapping: that is, a framework that facilitates the use of theory and empirical evidence in intervention development. In the preparatory phase we conducted a needs-assessment. The results of this phase were then used in the operational phase in which the program was elaborated as follow: in Step 1 we established program objectives; in Step 2 we translated theoretical methods into practical strategies; and in Step 3 we integrated the strategies into a self-management program which were designed to help individuals mobilize their skills to cope with their antiretroviral therapies (ART). These particular abilities are: ability to integrate ART in daily routine, to cope with side effects, to handle situations in which ART is difficult to take, to interact with health professionals and to maintain relationships with social contacts. To address individuals' resources and skills in conjunction with the experience of taking the medication, we developed two different modalities to deliver the intervention: direct support and virtual support. Direct support consists of four 45-minute individualized, face-to-face sessions with a health professional. The Web application involved at least four interactive sessions with a computer. This application was developed with the intention to support individuals in managing their therapy, in a punctual, real-time mode.

Here we present a comprehensive analysis of 10 patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) combined with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection and seropositive for anti-aquaporin-4 antibody (AQP4-Ab). Demographic, clinical, laboratory, neuroimaging, outcome, and follow-up data of the 10 patients were retrospectively analyzed. The median age at the onset of NMOSD was 35 years (range 25-43). Nine patients were female (90%). All patients were positive for HBsAg and had been diagnosed with CHB earlier than with NMOSD. One patient had an autoimmune disease. All patients had normal thyroid function. Paresthesia and visual impairment were the most common clinical symptoms. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters (protein and glucose) were normal in 10 cases, whereas slightly higher CSF white blood cell count was detected in 3 patients. The brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging findings were abnormal in 8 patients. All patients were treated with hormone and immunosuppressive therapy, and anti-HBV agents. Patients with detectable serum HBV DNA were more prone to liver damage after receiving high doses of corticosteroids. In 8 patients, the symptoms improved before they were discharged. Two patients with optic neuritis (ON) maintained the symptoms. A month later, 1/8 patient had recurrence of symptoms, and one ON patient progressed to NMO. Overall, the characteristics of NMOSD patients with CHB and seropositive for AQP4-Ab are usually nonspecific. Abnormal liver function test results in NMOSD patients should be a warning of possible CHB infection, and the treatment should be modified accordingly."

Thirty adults with symptomatic HIV infection, no previous AIDS-defining diagnosis, and CD4+ counts of 0.200-0.499 x 10(9)/L (200-499/mm3) received 28 tablets each day of either a standardized oral preparation of 31 Chinese herbs or a cellulose placebo. Primary outcome measures were changes in life satisfaction, perceived health, and number and severity of symptoms. Other outcomes included adherence, and changes in weight, CD4+ count, depression, anxiety, physical and social function, and mental health. Two placebo- and no herb-treated subjects had mild adverse events (AE). Subjects on both arms reported taking 94% of prescribed tablets. No differences between treatment groups reached the p < 0.05 level. Life satisfaction improved in herb-treated [+0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): +0.29, +1.43] but not in placebo-treated subjects (+0.20, 95% CI -0.35, + 0.75). Number of symptoms was reduced in subjects receiving herbs (-2.2, 95% CI -4.1, -0.3) but not in those receiving placebo (-0.3, 95% CI -3.2, +2.7). There were trends toward greater improvements among herb-treated subjects on all symptom subscales except dermatologic. Believing that one was receiving herbs was strongly associated with reporting that the treatment had helped (p < 0.005), but not with changes in life satisfaction or symptoms. There were improvements in life satisfaction and symptoms among subjects receiving the herbal therapy. Whether Chinese herbs are effective in the management of symptomatic HIV infection can be adequately addressed only by larger trials of longer duration."

However, factors influencing virologic response need to be further analyzed, to test the hypothesis that the reduction of plasma RNA viremia with NRTI may be greater in patients with higher baseline viral load (BVL) and to analyze the predictive factors of viral load drop below detection (200 HIV RNA copies/ml of plasma). Selected for the study were 169 HIV-1-infected antiretroviral therapy-naive patients with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts ranging from 6 to 1040/microl coming from three randomized studies comparing the efficacy of monotherapy (zidovudine [ZDV], 250 mg every 12 hours; N=40) versus two-drug therapy consisting of ZDV (250 mg every 12 hours) with dideoxycytidine (ddC, 0.75 mg every 8 hours) or didanosine (ddI, 200 mg every 12 hours; N=129). Viral load was measured at 1, 3, and 6 months by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A linear regression model was used to analyze the relation between BVL and the peak reduction of plasma RNA viremia. The variables included in a logistic regression model to determine the likelihood of VLs dropping below detection levels were age, gender, risk group for HIV-1 infection, baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count, BVL, clinical status (AIDS versus non-AIDS), HIV-1 phenotype (syncytium-inducing [SI] versus non-syncytium-inducing [NSI]) and type of treatment (monotherapy versus double therapy). The peak reduction of VL was related to baseline level following a linear model in both monotherapy and double-therapy regimens. In the subgroup of patients treated with two NRTIs, the regression line that fitted best with the data was log10 (peak reduction)=1.8-0.36 log10 (BVL) (F=23.5; p < .0001). This indicates that for every increase of 1 log10 of BVL, the peak reduction would be of 0.64 log10 greater. Forty-nine (29%) of the 169 patients dropped to <200 copies/ml. The likelihood of dropping below detection level was significantly greater in those receiving double therapy versus monotherapy (odds ratio [OR]=16.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2-128), in those with baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count >350/microl (OR=2.28; 95% CI, 1.1-4.9) and in those with BVL <10,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml (OR= 2.25; 95% CI, 1.1-6.1). None of the 13 patients with an SI phenotype at baseline dropped below detection levels. The reduction of VL in response to two NRTIs was greater in those patients with a higher level of BVL. In conclusion, peak reduction below detection in response to NRTI can be predicted and is associated with double therapy, with a baseline CD4+ cell count >350/microl and with a BVL <10,000 RNA copies/ml."

Thirty-six HCV genotype 1 and HIV co-infected patients with hemophilia in southern China were enrolled into the study. Using an ELISpot assay, HCV antigen-specific interferon (IFN) γ, interleukin (IL) 2, IL-4, and IL-10 secreting cells were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of IL28B were determined, and immunological, virologic, and clinical variables were collected to identify factors associated with HCV-sustained VR (SVR) at week 72 after treatment. At baseline, there were no significant differences in IFN-γ and IL-2 mediated immune responses in subjects with VR versus non-responders. Higher IL-10 specific responses to NS3 were observed in VR patients. Subjects who had significant decreases in IL-10 responses at week 72 compared with baseline for NS3 and NS5 were more likely to be VR. In SVR, IL-2 production decreased moderately, and the levels of IL-4 were low throughout. The main correlation for SVR in genotype-l infected subjects was sustained HCV-specific IFN-γ responses through the whole 72-week period. In subjects with HIV and HCV co-infection combined with hemophilia, IL28B genotype CC, a decrease in HCV specific IL-l0 and IL-2 responses, and the maintenance of IFN-γ responses during treatment were associated with a 12- or 72-week VR."

We investigated the efficacy and safety of treating hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB patients with 52 weeks of PEG-IFN-alpha-2b (100 microg weekly) alone or in combination with lamivudine (100 mg daily). Seventy patients with advanced fibrosis (Ishak fibrosis score 4-6) and 169 patients without advanced fibrosis, all with compensated liver disease, participated in the study. Virologic response, defined as HBeAg seroconversion and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA < 10,000 copies/ml at week 78, occurred significantly more often in patients with advanced fibrosis than in those without (25% versus 12%, respectively; P = 0.02). Also patients with cirrhosis (n = 24) exhibited a virologic response more frequently than did patients without cirrhosis (30% versus 14%, respectively; P = 0.02). Improvement in liver fibrosis occurred more frequently in patients with advanced fibrosis (66% versus 26%, P < 0.001). HBV genotype A was more prevalent among patients with advanced fibrosis than among those without (57% versus 24%, P < 0.001). Most adverse events, including serious adverse events, were observed equally as frequently in patients with advanced fibrosis and those without. Fatigue, anorexia, and thrombocytopenia occurred more often in patients with advanced fibrosis than in those without (P < 0.01).

Treatment parameters included virological response, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization.Of 180 patients studied, 56 received de novo telbivudine monotherapy (LDT group); 45 received entecavir monotherapy (ETV group); 40 received LDT following interferon (interferon-telbivudine [IFN-LDT] group); and 39 received ETV following interferon (interferon-entecavir [IFN-ETV] group). At week 52, virological response occurred in significantly more patients in the IFN-ETV group than the ETV group (87.2% vs 57.8%, P = .003). At week 104, HBeAg seroconversion occurred in significantly more patients in the IFN-ETV group than the ETV group (44.4% vs 22.2%, P = .03). At week 52, virological response was achieved by significantly more patients in the IFN-LDT group than the LDT group (85.0% vs 64.3%, P = .02).This study showed that switch to rescue therapy with ETV or LDT therapy after failure of interferon therapy resulted in more rapid virologic response than with de novo treatment with either ETV or LDT; rescue therapy with ETV resulted in a greater HBeAg seroconversion rate."

The enrolled patients were divided into 2 groups based on the distribution of lesions. One group of patients had their lesions at the central brain (group 1, n = 34) and the other group of patients had their lesions at the superficial brain (group 2, n = 21). We explored their MRI characterization of brain. In addition, we also compared their CD4 T cell counts and immune reconstitution effects between the 2 groups based on the imaging findings.No statistical difference was found in terms of age and gender between the 2 groups. The medians of CD4 T cell counts were 11.67 cells/mm (3.00-52.00 cells/mm) in group 1 and 42.00 cells/mm (10.00-252.00 cells/mm) in group 2.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients with cryptococcosis. Clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, treatment, and outcomes for 149 HIV-positive and 29 HIV-negative patients were compared. Neurological involvement occurred more frequently in HIV-positive patients (91.9 versus 20.7%, P<0.001), whereas pulmonary involvement was more frequently observed in HIV-negative patients (34.5 versus 2.7%, P<0.001). Ninety percent of HIV-positive patients and 74% of HIV-negative patients had positive serum cryptococcal antigen (P=0.119). HIV-positive patients were more likely to have a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) preparation that is positive for India ink staining (81 versus 50%, P<0.001) and a CSF cryptococcal antigen titer of > or =1:1,024 (61.1 versus 16.7%, P=0.038). Most of the patients in both groups received amphotericin B as the primary therapy. Cryptococcosis-related mortality was high and did not differ between the two groups (22.2 versus 34.5%, P=0.162). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that HIV-positive patients had a higher relapse rate (P=0.011), especially among those lacking antiretroviral therapy. In conclusion, clinical presentation of cryptococcosis among HIV-negative patients varies and differs from that of HIV-positive patients.

11122,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Qualitative differences among strains of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) may influence viral infectivity for cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and determine or at least significantly influence the neuropathogenesis of brain infection. In this study, we compared infectivity for these cells in vitro among several different laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains differing in cellular tropism. These strains included three lymphotropic strains (SF2, NL4-3, and SG3.1), two macrophage-tropic strains (SF128A, SF162), and one brain-derived strain (YU2). In microglia, macrophage-tropic strain SF128A established productive infection while the lymphotropic strain SF2 did not. In infected astrocytes, all HIV-1 strains transiently produced variable and much lower levels of p24 antigen. Viral DNA env or tat gene sequences were amplified from infected astrocytes; the amplified signals varied among HIV-1 strains, but the strongest viral DNA signals were obtained from cells infected by the lymphotropic strains SF2 and SG3.1. Transfection of astrocytes with infectious HIV-1 proviral DNA clones confirmed the observation that HIV-1 strains differ in their ability to replicate in astrocytes. Transfection revealed post-entry blocks to replication by macrophage-tropic proviruses pSF128A and pSF162. However, cytomegalovirus (CMV) superinfection of transfected astrocytes enhanced p24 production by lymphotropic HIV-1 proviruses twofold and stimulated p24 production by the otherwise inactive macrophage-tropic proviruses. This study demonstrates the spectrum of HIV-1 strain-associated variation in infectivity for neuroglia, and suggests, in addition, that herpesviral factors or viral-induced cellular factors may stimulate HIV-1 infection in astrocytes and expand the neural cell tropism of certain HIV-1 strains."

Two months before admission the patient had unprotected sexual contact with a potential hepatitis B-infected man. Virological screening performed in our clinic revealed IgM antibodies against hepatitis B virus core protein (anti-HBc-IgM) and elevated HBV-DNA. Our first diagnosis was an acute hepatitis B virus infection. During her stay at our clinic the patient achieved HBe seroconversion and a loss of HBV-DNA. Nevertheless the transaminases remained high and jaundice persisted. The histological examination of the liver biopsy showed interface hepatitis with plasma cells as the characteristic signs of autoimmune hepatitis. On that basis we started an immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone in parallel with a prophylactic lamivudine therapy and after two weeks there was a complete resolution of jaundice and a normalisation of transaminases. In conclusion, we present a rare case report of an autoimmune hepatitis as a result a newly acquired hepatitis B infection.

8908,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The major pandemics caused by chronic viral infections is produced by HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV), with estimates of 38, 70, and 250 million people worldwide, respectively (Fig. 1). During the last couple of years, the advent of direct oral antivirals has allowed pursuing global HCV eradication. In an unprecedented manner, these drugs cure more than 95% of hepatitis C patients when given for only 2-3 months. The enthusiasm on HCV has renewed the interest for curative strategies for both HIV and HBV. However, important biological differences between all three viruses may preclude envisioning a similar rapid success for either HIV or HBV than for HCV infection. As shown in figure 1, once infection of targeted cells has occurred, the viral genetic material only replicates in the cytosol for HCV whereas it enters the nucleus and integrates into the chromosomes as provirus for HIV or is converted in a circular covalently closed form (cccDNA) for HBV (Fig. 1). Blocking viral nucleic acid replication for a minimum lag of time allows definitive clearance of HCV infection, with degradation of residual cytoplasmic HCV-RNA strands. In contrast, blocking viral replication has only a transient effect on HIV or HBV, as mRNA expression resumes following treatment discontinuation, given the stability of the HIV provirus or the HBV cccDNA, respectively. The European Liver meeting took held in Paris on April 2018. A relatively large number of presentations addressed distinct new hepatitis B therapeutic strategies. Table 1 summarizes some of the molecules that have been investigated so far with more promising results, grouping them into distinct drug classes (Soriano et al. Exp Op Inv Drugs 2017;26:843-51), based on their distinct mechanism of action and targeted steps in the HBV life cycle (Fig. 2). Considering the pros and cons of novel HBV therapeutic candidates, it has become apparent new HBV gene therapies among the most attractive. Several advances have contributed to position gene therapy in front within the experimental HBV armamentarium. First, progresses in delivery systems, including the use of polymers and nanoformulations have allowed developing easier forms of administration that now are becoming subcutaneous and monthly. Second, the synthetic production of oligonucleotide formulations has reduced costs. Third, the specificity against HBV is higher than for other experimental agents, as immune modulators that enhance innate immunity, such as TLR agonists (i.e., GS-9620) or checkpoint inhibitors (i.e., nivolumab). Fourth, significant declines in serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are demonstrated during gene therapy, which have never been seen using the most potent polymerase inhibitors (i.e., tenofovir or entecavir). Finally, unanticipated significant reductions in cccDNA are seen with HBV gene therapy, most likely as prove of an indirect benefit of waning the immunosuppressive effect of large over amounts of HBsAg released by infected hepatocytes that contributes to T-cell exhaustion. In a pioneering study, Roche was the first to publish the potent effect of an oral small molecule that blocked HBV gene expression (Mueller et al. J Hepatol 2018;68:412-20). The drug belonged to the dihydroquinolizinone class, and directly or indirectly modified viral RNAs, promoting their degradation. This posttranscriptional silencing was accompanied by rapid drops in HBV-DNA and more importantly in serum HBsAg in the humanized mice. However, Roche decided to discontinue any further clinical development of the drug. Nowadays, two major groups of agents are being developed as HBV gene therapies. At this time, interference RNA (iRNA) molecules and nucleic acid polymers (NAPs) are the most promising. Overall, iRNA is double-stranded RNA molecules, 20 nucleotides long. One strand matches a segment of specific HBV mRNA and induces its degradation. Several iRNA molecules have entered into Phase II clinical trials (Flisiak et al. Exp Op Biol Ther, in press), including ARB-1467 and AB-729 (Arbutus), ARO-HBV (Arrowhead), ALN-HBV (Alnylam), and IONIS-HBVRx (Ionis). In most cases, they are tested as part of combination therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogs and/or peginterferon. NAPs are phosphorothioate 40 length oligonucleotides that no map any HBV sequence. However, they interact with a liver host target protein (apolipoprotein-like) and result in specific inhibition of HBV mRNAs. This is followed by rapid suppression of HBsAg release (Roehl et al. Mol Ther Nuc Acids 2017;8:1-12). In a pilot study with intravenous REP-2139, investigators from Replicor demonstrated strong reductions in HBV-DNA along with significant drops in HBsAg and seroconversion in some patients. More interestingly was the recognition of significant reductions in hepatic cccDNA, most likely a result of an indirect effect following the removal of large amounts of HBsAg from the bloodstream that contributes to impaired T-cell responses in chronic hepatitis B patients (Bazinet et al. EASL, Paris 2018; abstract FRI-343). An improved NAP, named REP-2165 and subcutaneous administration are currently being tested."

Of 14,488 scientifically selected participants aged 12 to 74, 821 had evidence of past or present infection with HBV. In the white population, the weighted estimate of hepatitis B infection was 3.2 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.1 to 4.2). A steady increase with age was seen; by ages 65 to 74, the prevalence was 6.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5.2 to 8.5). In the black population, the overall weighted estimate of prevalence was 13.7 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 11.6 to 15.8). In this racial group, there was a dramatic increase with age, with the oldest age groups having a prevalence of 39.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 29.1 to 50.0). In both racial groups, there was a low prevalence of infection in young children that began to rise between ages 12 and 18. In a multivariate analysis of factors associated with infection, there was an interaction of race with age; therefore, the odds ratio for race is presented for four ages. This ratio ranged from 3.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 4.2) for a 15-year-old to 8.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 6.5 to 10.3) for a 70-year-old. These relative odds estimates were not substantially affected by adjustment for the available information on risk factors for HBV infection. The results of this study in a representative sample of the United States population show that adult black Americans are at high risk for hepatitis B infection. Other independent predictors of HBV positivity include male sex; residing in the South, Northeast, or West; residing in a city of 250,000 or more people; serving in the armed forces; living below the poverty level; and having a positive treponemal test for syphilis. These data suggest that the immunization practices for controlling this disease should be re-examined."

However, the causal link between HCV infection and TB risk remains unclear. We conducted a population-based cohort study to elucidate the association between HCV infection and TB disease by analyzing Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. We enrolled 5454 persons with HCV infection and 54,274 age- and sex-matched non-HCV-infected persons between January 1998 and December 2007. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to measure the association between HCV infection and active TB disease. Incidence rate of active TB disease was higher among HCV infection than in control (134.1 vs 89.1 per 100,000 person-years; incidence rate ratio 1.51; P = 0.014). HCV infection was significantly associated with active TB disease in multivariate Cox regression (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-5.53; P < 0.001) and competing death risk event analysis (adjusted HR 2.11; 95% CI, 1.39-3.20; P < 0.001). Multivariate stratified analysis further revealed that HCV infection was a risk of active TB disease in most strata. This nationwide cohort study suggests that HCV infection is associated with a higher risk of developing active TB disease. "
18885,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"To identify risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in intravenous drug users, we undertook a study of the seroprevalence of HIV antibody in 452 persons enrolled in a methadone-treatment program in the Bronx, New York. The seroprevalence of HIV was 39.4 percent overall, 49.1 percent in blacks, 41.8 percent in Hispanics, and 17.2 percent in non-Hispanic whites (P less than 0.001 for all comparisons). The presence of HIV antibody was associated with the number of injections per month (P less than 0.001), the percentage of injections with used needles (P less than 0.001), the average number of injections with cocaine per month (P less than 0.001), and the percentage of injections with needles that were shared with strangers or acquaintances (P less than 0.001), a practice that was more common among blacks and Hispanics than among whites. The number of heterosexual sex partners who used intravenous drugs was associated with HIV infection in women (P less than 0.004) and was the only risk factor found for users who had not injected drugs after 1982 (P less than 0.05). The presence of HIV antibody was independently associated with being black or Hispanic (adjusted odds ratio, 4.56; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.65 to 8.14), a more recent year of the last injection of drugs (adjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.35), the percentage of injections of drugs that took place in ""shooting galleries"" (adjusted odds ratio, 1.49; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 1.88), having sex partners who used intravenous drugs (adjusted odds ratio 1.24; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.45), and low income (adjusted odds ratio, 1.55; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.10 to 2.17). We conclude that differences in both the social setting of drug use and behavior related to injection carry different risks for infection with HIV and may explain, in part, the higher seroprevalence of HIV among blacks and Hispanics. In addition, we found that heterosexual activity was an independent risk factor for drug users."

To better characterize HIV infection in unregistered inner-city parturients in Atlanta, we offered routine voluntary screening for HIV antibody and requested HIV risk-behavior profiles on all unregistered and registered parturients seen at Grady Memorial Hospital from July 1, 1987 to June 30, 1988. Of the 834 unregistered and 7356 registered parturients screened, significantly more unregistered parturients were seropositive on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot testing, 12 (1.4%) versus 26 (0.4%) (odds ratio 4.06; 95% confidence interval 1.93-8.43). Five unregistered and 15 registered parturients were seropositive by repeat enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing but were Western blot-negative. Significantly more unregistered parturients reported both a history of intravenous drug use, 4.4 versus 1.5% (odds ratio 3.09; 95% confidence interval 2.10-4.54), and crack cocaine use, 3 versus 0.8% (odds ratio 3.96; 95% confidence interval 2.42-6.44). Significantly more unregistered parturients acknowledged risk factors for HIV infection, 14.3 versus 9.9% (odds ratio 1.46; 95% confidence interval 1.19-1.80). Nearly all registered and 86% of unregistered parturients consented to HIV testing. Nearly all parturients completed HIV risk-behavior questionnaires.

In considering ways to further reduce deaths, we assessed the contribution of concurrent HIV/AIDS diagnosis to HIV-related mortality in New York City among persons newly diagnosed with AIDS. We used Cox regression to conduct a retrospective cohort analysis of HIV-related mortality among 15,211 residents age 13+ reported with AIDS to the population-based HIV/AIDS registry between January 2002 and June 2005. Concurrent HIV/AIDS diagnosis was defined as a diagnosis of AIDS occurring within 1 month of initial diagnosis of HIV. HIV-related mortality was 20.2% among persons diagnosed concurrently and 12.2% among those diagnosed nonconcurrently (p < 0.0001). Concurrent HIV/AIDS was associated with more than twice the risk of HIV-related death within the 4 months after diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.94-2.65) but no increased risk thereafter (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.77-1.61). Other significant predictors of death included injection drug use and birth in the Caribbean or Latin America. After 4 years 11.9% of all HIV-related deaths were attributable to a concurrent HIV/AIDS diagnosis. Public health initiatives that facilitate early diagnosis of HIV may reduce HIV-related mortality by giving people the opportunity to initiate care and begin treatment with HAART before immunosuppression places them at risk for opportunistic illness and death."
4753,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"We analyzed the association of circulating Th-17 cells (cTh-17) with immune activation (IA), immune exhaustion (IE) and regulatory T-cells (T-regs) in 20 human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected patients with impaired restoration of CD4 T-cell counts despite prolonged suppression of plasma viremia (discordant) and compared it with 20 HIV-1 infected patients showing good immunologic and virologic responses (concordant) following highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Discordant HIV-1 infected patients showed significantly higher frequencies of cTh-17 cells compared to concordant patients and healthy controls after PMA+Ionomicin stimulation. Discordant patients also showed higher CD4 T-cell immune activation (HLA-DR+CD38+) than concordant patients which directly correlated with microbial translocation. Additionally, CD4 T-cells of discordant patients showed higher frequencies of CD4 T-cells expressing multiple immune exhaustion markers (Tim3+PD-1+) which correlated with immune activation indicating that combined analysis of inhibitory molecules along with PD-1 might be a better predictor for immune exhaustion of CD4 T-cells. Increased cTh-17 cell frequency correlated inversely with CD4 T-cell percentages and absolute counts and directly with CD4 T-cell immune activation and T-reg frequencies. Persistent CD4 T-cell immune activation might favor differentiation of activated CD4 T-cells toward cTh-17 phenotype in discordant patients. Discordant patients had significantly lower baseline CD4 T-cell counts and higher viral load at the initiation of HAART and higher immune activation and immune exhaustion after being on HAART for long time indicating that these factors might be associated with an increase in cTh-17 cell frequency, thus, increasing the risk of disease progression despite virologic control."

Forty-three consecutive antiretroviral-naive patients were prospectively analysed for clinical, biochemical, immunological and virological parameters at starting HAART, and followed for 4 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter. At baseline, all patients underwent a thoracic computer tomography scan, in order to measure thymic volume, as well, T-cell phenotype (naive CD4 and CD8 T cells) and the number of TREC-bearing cells were obtained. CD4 cell repopulation was considered as an increase > or = 200 cells/mm3 above baseline count. Twenty-seven patients (62.8%) increased > or = 200 cells/mm3 above baseline levels during the follow-up. The median time to event was 182 days (84-537 days). On the univariate analysis, to be younger than 36 years, showing a CD4 cell count > or = 272 cells/mm3, a total naive T-cell count > or = 128 cells/mm3, a TREC-bearing cell count > or = 0.74 cells/mm3, and a thymic volume > or =3.07 cc at baseline were statistically associated to the event studied. However, when the multivariate analysis was performed, only thymic volume at baseline was independently associated (P=0.002) to CD4 cell recovery. This co-variable was identified as a positive predictor [hazard ratio, 1.22 (95% confidence interval: 1.16-1.28)]. In summary, data presented herewith show that thymic volume is the best thymic function-related marker for predicting early CD4 T-cell recovery in adult HIV-infected patients under HAART."

Although most of HTLV1-infected individuals remain asymptomatic carriers, 1% to 5% and 3% to 5% develop adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, respectively. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HTLV1 infection in hemodialysis patients in Sari and Ghaemshahr. This cross-sectional study was conducted on160 patients using random samples selection, and included 80 men and 80 women (mean age, 59.1 &plusmn; 14.7 years). All the samples were screened for HTLV1 antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and positive samples were confirmed by Western blot assay. Only 1 patient had a positive anti-HTLV1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, which was confirmed by Western blot. The overall prevalence of HTLV1 seropositivity was 0.6%. The patient was a 21-year-old woman with a history of multiple blood transfusions. She had a history of unsuccessful kidney transplantation and had been on hemodialysis before transplant, too. This study suggests that HTLV1 infection may not be prevalent in high-risk patients in Mazandaran province, and there is no need for HTLV1 screening of blood samples."

Their survival into adolescence and beyond represent one of the major successes in the battle against the disease that has claimed the lives of millions of children. This population is diverse and there are unique issues related to antiretroviral treatment and management. Drawing from the literature and experience, this paper discusses several broad areas related to antiretroviral management, including: 1) diverse presentation of HIV, (2) use of combination antiretroviral therapy including in the setting of co-morbidities and rapid growth and development, (3) challenges of cART, including nonadherence, resistance, and management of the highly treatment-experienced adolescent patient, (4) additional unique concerns and management issues related to PHIV-infected adolescents, including the consequences of longterm inflammation, risk of transmission, and transitions to adult care. In each section, the experience in both resource-rich and limited settings are discussed with the aim of highlighting the differences and importantly the similarities, to share lessons learnt and provide insight into the multi-faceted approaches that may be needed to address the challenges faced by this unique and resilient population."

Inflammation and ulceration are associated with increased shedding, while highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been shown to have a protective effect. We sought to examine the impact of cervical biopsies, a routine component of cervical cancer screening, on HIV-1 genital RNA levels in HIV-infected women on HAART. We enrolled HIV-1-infected women undergoing cervical biopsy for diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 in this prospective cohort study. All were stable on HAART for at least 3 months. Clinical and demographic information as well as plasma HIV-1 viral load were collected at the baseline visit. Specimens for cervical HIV-1 RNA were collected immediately prior to biopsy, and 2 and 7 days afterward. Quantitative PCR determined HIV-1 concentration in cervical specimens at each time point to a lower limit of detection of 40 copies/specimen. Among the 30 participants, five (16.6%) women had detectable cervical HIV-1 RNA at baseline, of whom four (80%) had detectable HIV-1 RNA after cervical biopsy, with no significant increase in viral load in the follow-up specimens. Only one woman (3.3%) with undetectable baseline cervical HIV-1 RNA had detection postbiopsy. Detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA was the only factor associated with baseline cervical HIV-1 RNA. In women on HAART, an increase in cervical HIV-1 RNA detection or concentration was not associated with cervical biopsy. These findings help provide safety data regarding cervical cancer screening and diagnosis in HIV-infected women and inform postprocedure counseling."

Despite this, few data are available concerning renal disease in this patient group. A retrospective review was conducted of all HIV-positive patients of an inner metropolitan sexual health service who attended from 1 August 2013 to 31 July 2014 for HIV management. One hundred eighty-eight HIV-positive patients attended the clinic during the study period. The majority were male (96%), Caucasian (70%) and 30-39 years of age (37%). There was a high prevalence of renal risk factors in the population, including potentially nephrotoxic antiretroviral therapy (61%), smoking (38%), hypertension (12%), dyslipidemia (11%) and hepatitis C co-infection (7%). In the previous year, measurements of estimated glomerular filtration rate were performed in all patients, but measurements of lipid profiles, urinary protein and serum phosphate were performed within the last year in only 48%, 33% and 30% of patients, respectively. These are the first comprehensive data regarding renal disease, associated risk factors and screening and management practices in the HIV-positive patient population of a specialized sexual health service in Australia. This patient population demonstrates a particularly high prevalence of risk factors for renal disease. Despite this, screening investigations were not performed as recommended. This represents a potential area to improve patient care."

Data are presented on 34 patients. 11 patients had tenofovir added to a stable anti-retroviral treatment (ART) and 23 patients had drugs other than tenofovir. CD4 counts, HIV-RNA levels and genotypic resistance were determined at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. After initiation of tenofovir treatment, a mean decrease in HIV-RNA for all 34 patients was observed (-0.43 log1o copies/ml (+/- 1.22) and -0.49 log10 copies/ml (+/- 1.36) after 3 and 6 months, respectively, (p = 0.045)). However, the effect of tenofovir on HIV-RNA in the group of patients who had tenofovir added to a stable ART was limited, and the decrease in HIV-RNA was significantly higher in patients who had drugs other than tenofovir changed as well (p = 0.004 and p = 0.03 after 3 and 6 months, respectively). After initiation of tenofovir treatment, no significant increases in CD4 count were observed. All new NRTI-associated mutations could be explained by the background treatment. In conclusion, we observed a significant decrease in HIV-RNA only when tenofovir was prescribed, in conjunction with other anti-retroviral drugs, to patients on a failing highly active antiretroviral drug regimen (HAART)."

However, the successful application of HAART (highly active anti-retroviral therapy) drug regimens has greatly prolonged the life expectancy of HIV-positive patients. Therefore, it has become appropriate to consider this patient population for transplantation. HIV positive transplants are being performed around the country in controlled settings, usually as part of a research protocol. The aim of our study is to describe the Louisiana experience with organ transplantation into HIV-positive patients. We identified seven HIV-positive patients who underwent kidney or kidney/pancreas transplantation at our center between 2007 and 2010. We performed a retrospective chart review to ascertain graft function, as well as virologic and immunologic status post-transplant. Renal function (glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine concentrations) improved in all subjects post-transplant, and six of seven (85.8%) subjects remained virologically suppressed with no progression to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Overall, two-year graft and patient survival rates were 85.5%. HIV seropositive End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients represent a new population of patients that can be successfully transplanted. This offers a new dimension in care for successful HAART therapy to prolong the life of HIV-infected patients."

Patients were randomly assigned to receive a 5-drug salvage regimen immediately (noninterruption [NI] group; n=24 patients) or after 12 weeks of STI (interruption [I] group; n=22 patients). At week 48, 45% of patients in the I group and 46% of patients in the NI group had virus loads <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL (P=.619). No differences in CD4 cell counts were seen between groups at week 48 (P=.734). A complete reversion to wild-type genotype was detected in 35% of patients in the I group, but this phenomenon did not affect the virological response. The only overall baseline factor associated with ensuing virus suppression was a lower number of nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor-resistant mutations (relative risk, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.93; P=.021). A prior STI seems to confer no additional benefit to subsequent virological or immunological outcomes of a salvage regimen."

Adherence (percentage of doses taken as prescribed) was calculated for both the day and the week preceding each of 6 research visits. Mean self-reported 1-day adherence was 79% (median, 86%), and mean self-reported 1-week adherence was 78% (median, 85%). Mean MEMS 1-day adherence was 57% (median, 52%), and mean MEMS 1-week adherence was 53% (median, 49%). One-day and 1-week estimates were highly correlated (r>.8 for both measures). Both self-reported and MEMS adherence were correlated with concurrent HIV load (r=.43-.60), but the likelihood of achieving virologic suppression was greater if MEMS adherence was high than if self-reported adherence was high. We conclude that self-reported adherence is higher than MEMS adherence, but a strong relationship exists between both measures and virus load. However, electronic monitoring is more sensitive than self-report for the detection of nonadherence and should be used in adherence intervention studies."

To date, determinants of successful therapy in this population are unknown. Substance use and clinical correlates of viral suppression were studied in 100 HIV-1-infected drug users receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least six months in Hanoi, Vietnam. The mean age of the cohort was 29.9 + 4.9 years; all were men. A majority of patients (73%) achieved viral suppression (HIV-RNA <1000 copies/mL). Correlates of viral suppression include self-reported > or = 95% adherence (P < 0.01) and current use of trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (P < 0.01); current or ever diagnosed with tuberculosis was associated with viral non-suppression (P = 0.006). Tobacco use was prevalent (84%), and surprisingly 48% of patients reported active drug use; neither was associated with viral non-suppression. This is the first study to document successful ART treatment in a population of Vietnamese drug users; rates of viral suppression are comparable to other international populations. The 28% of patients without HIV-1 suppression highlight the need for adherence promotion, risk reduction programmes, and population-based surveillance strategies for assessing the emergence of HIV drug resistance in settings where access to viral load and drug resistance testing is limited."

We sought to determine HIV-related stigma prevalence among adults in care, describe which socio-demographic groups bear the greatest stigma burden, and assess the association between stigma and sustained HIV viral suppression. The Medical Monitoring Project measures characteristics of U.S. HIV-infected adults receiving care using a national probability sample. We used weighted data collected from June 2011 to May 2014 and assessed self-reported internalized stigma based on agreement with six statements. Overall, 79.1% endorsed ≥1 HIV-related stigma statements (n = 13,841). The average stigma score was 2.4 (out of a possible high score of six). White males had the lowest stigma scores while Hispanic/Latina females and transgender persons who were multiracial or other race had the highest. Although stigma was associated with viral suppression, it was no longer associated after adjusting for age. Stigma was common among HIV-infected adults in care. Results suggest individual and community stigma interventions may be needed, particularly among those who are <50 years old or Hispanic/Latino. Stigma was not independently associated with viral suppression; however, this sample was limited to adults in care. Examining HIV-infected persons not in care may elucidate stigma's association with viral suppression."

Mean maximum virus load decreases ranged from -1.31 log10 copies/mL of plasma at week 1 in the group receiving HBY 097 monotherapy (250 mg three times daily) to -2.19 log10 copies/mL at week 4 in the group receiving zidovudine plus HBY 097 (750 mg three times daily). After 12 weeks, these patients had viral RNA copy numbers 1.05 log10 below baseline. Genotypic analysis of resistance development revealed reverse transcriptase K103N variants in most patients, which was associated with less durable efficacy of HBY 097 treatment. Fewer patients receiving combination therapy with high-dose HBY 097 developed the K103N variant (P<.01). HBY 097 caused pronounced acute suppression of HIV-1 replication both in combination with zidovudine and alone. Therefore, sustained antiviral activity can be expected from multiple combination therapy regimens including a quinoxaline derivative."

Linkage to and retention in care are required for access to ART. We describe the impact of care on viral suppression using routinely reported surveillance data. We included New York City residents ≥13 years of age, diagnosed with HIV/AIDS from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2009 with a viral load (VL) or CD4 reported within six months of diagnosis and ≥1 VL reported from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2011. To examine viral rebound, we restricted the analysis to those who achieved viral suppression and had a subsequent VL measure reported by 30 June 2011. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate factors associated with time to viral suppression (VL ≤ 400 copies/mL) and rebound (VL > 1000 copies/mL). Initiation of care within three months of diagnosis (CD4/VL report within three months of diagnosis), female sex, and an initial CD4 < 350 (cells/mm(3)) at diagnosis significantly increased the likelihood of viral suppression. Irregular care (no CD4/VL reported every six months), younger age, non-white race/ethnicity, having an initial CD4 ≥ 350 at diagnosis, and AIDS diagnosis by 2010 increased the likelihood of rebound. These findings lend support to interventions for improving linkage to and maintenance in regular care as a way to achieve and maintain suppression. Surveillance data represent an ideal means for monitoring engagement in care and viral suppression at the population level. "

All analyses of HIV-1 RNA were obtained using the Roche Amplicor assay or its earlier prototype. Time to loss of response was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis; Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the influence of baseline variables. Among 523 patients with < or = 6 months of prior zidovudine treatment, the probability of HIV-1 RNA suppression below 400 copies/ml at 48 weeks was 71% in those with baseline HIV-1 RNA < 5000 copies/ml, but only 14% in those with HIV-1 RNA between 50,000 and 200,000 copies/ml. Among 560 patients with > 6 months of prior zidovudine treatment, the rates of sustained viral suppression were lower, but also significantly associated with the baseline HIV-1 RNA. Multivariate analyses showed no independent effect of CD4 cell count, age, sex, race, or CDC disease stage on the probability of sustained HIV-1 RNA suppression. When patients with < or = 6 months of prior therapy were stratified based on the magnitude of HIV-1 RNA nadir achieved during treatment, those who reached a nadir of < 400 copies/ml retained this response for significantly longer time periods than the ones who only achieved partial viral suppression. In conclusion, baseline HIV-1 RNA levels and the duration of prior zidovudine therapy strongly predict the antiretroviral efficacy of zidovudine/lamivudine. The baseline parameters should influence the choice of the antiretroviral regimen."

A 60% incidence of HIV infection was seen in this study population, with SCC presenting as the initial manifestation of HIV infection in 2 of the 6 patients. In addition. HIV-infected patients were significantly younger than non-infected patients at (p = 0.01). None of the HIV-infected patients had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) at the time of presentation, but 5 of 6 patients had an abnormal CD4 count, compared to none of the non-infected patients (p = 0.05). The absolute CD4 count in HIV-infected patients decreased to less than 100x10(9)/L in the majority of these patients within 3 months of presentation with HNSCC (p = 0.05). Treatment-associated complications were common in HIV-infected patients, occurring in 4 of the 6 cases in contrast to none of the patients without HIV infection (p = 0.046). Outcome was significantly poorer for HIV-Infected patients, with 5 patients succumbing to their disease within one year, in contrast to none of the non-infected patients (p = 0.046).

Although recent studies suggest a relationship between smoking and suboptimal adherence to ART, a more in-depth understanding of this relationship is needed. We conducted a secondary analysis using data from a randomized controlled smoking cessation trial to investigate the association of nonadherence to ART with potential demographic, psychosocial (perceived stress and depression), and substance use (nicotine dependence, illicit drug use, and alcohol use) variables among persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who smoke. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of participants (n=326) was 45.9 years old (SD=7.6). Additionally, the majority were male (72.1%), self-identified as black (76.7%), and reported sexual contact as the mode of HIV acquisition (70%). Unadjusted logistic regression analysis indicated that depression (odds ratio [OR]=1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.00, 1.04), illicit drug use (OR=2.39; 95% CI=1.51, 3.79) and alcohol use (OR=2.86; 95%CI=1.79, 4.57) were associated with nonadherence. Adjusted logistic regression analysis indicated that nicotine dependence (OR=1.13; 95% CI=1.02, 1.25), illicit drug use (OR=2.10; 95% CI=1.27, 3.49), alcohol use (OR=2.50; 95% CI=1.52, 4.12), and age (OR=1.04; 95% CI=1.00, 1.07) were associated with nonadherence. Nicotine dependence, illicit drug use, and alcohol use are potentially formidable barriers to ART adherence among PLWHA who smoke. Future efforts should investigate the complex relationships among these variables to improve adherence particularly among populations confronted with multifaceted health challenges."

Hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection has been associated with increased risk of CKD, but prior studies lack information on potential mechanisms. We evaluated the association between HCV or hepatitis B (HBV) co-infection and progressive CKD among 3,441 antiretroviral-treated clinical trial participants. Progressive CKD was defined as the composite of end-stage renal disease, renal death, or significant glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline (25% decline to eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or 25% decline with a baseline <60). Generalized Estimating Equations were used to model the odds of progressive CKD. At baseline, 13.8% and 3.3% of participants were co-infected with HCV and HBV, respectively. Median eGFR was 111, and 3.7% developed progressive CKD. After adjustment, the odds of progressive CKD were increased in participants with HCV (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.07-2.76) or HBV (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.15-4.44). Participants with undetectable or low HCV-RNA had similar odds of progressive CKD as HCV seronegative participants, while participants with HCV-RNA >800,000 IU/ml had increased odds (OR 3.07; 95% CI 1.60-5.90). Interleukin-6, hyaluronic acid, and the FIB-4 hepatic fibrosis index were higher among participants who developed progressive CKD, but were no longer associated with progressive CKD after adjustment.

We studied 157 HCV+ haemophilic men (85 HIV+ and 72 HIV-), on whom dates of HIV and HCV seroconversion and clinical outcomes were known. Time to ESLD was determined by Kaplan-Meier product-limit methods and risk factors for ESLD progression were analysed by a Cox proportional hazards model. Among HIV+ men, ESLD was more common, 17 of 85 (20.0%) than in HIV-, eight of 72 (11.1%) and median ESLD-free survival significantly shorter, P = 0.009, hazard ratio 3.00 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.27-7.08].

Partial HIV-1 pol and HCV NS5b gene sequences were obtained from 97 persons infected with HIV-1 to determine the efficacy of treatment, the prevalence of drug-resistant mutations, and the impact of HCV infection on disease progression of infection with HIV-1. After antiretroviral therapy, 60 out of 97 HIV-1-infected blood donors had their HIV-1 RNA levels reduced to an undetectable level. Drug-resistant mutations to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were detected in one-third of treatment failure patients, with K103N as the most frequent mutation. Drug-resistant mutations were not detected in the other two-thirds of treatment-failure patients, suggesting a poor adherence to the treatment. The majority of HIV-1-infected patients (91.8%) were also infected with HCV. Sequence analysis showed that they were infected with HCV subtype 1b (47.5%) or 2a (52.5%). HCV viral loads were significantly higher in patients infected with subtype 2a than in patients infected with HCV subtype 1b, although no differences in HIV-1 viral loads and CD4(+)T cell counts was observed between the two subtypes. These results suggest that improved adherence and treatment regimens will be critical to effectively treat HIV-1 and HCV-coinfected patients in resource-limited areas."

The chest radiograph and the computed tomography (CT)-scan revealed a miliary pneumonia. On a previous serum sample varicella-zoster (VZV)-specific serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G titre was 1/200. A high dose acyclovir treatment was effective, but recurrences occurred twice when the treatment was discontinued. During the first recurrence the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected the presence of VZV in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of secondary varicella with pulmonary involvement. Secondary varicella pneumonia has not been reported in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adult until now. The use of PCR on a BAL sample was very useful in this case because viral culture remained negative. Recurrences of the varicella pneumonia suggested that a maintenance treatment was required in this deeply immunocompromised patient."

This study has also identified four novel secondary mutations, Q91R, S147G, A153G, and M183I, not previously reported in HIV-1 patients failing RAL therapy. Resistant variants involving the Y143C pathway were noted to have persisted beyond 4 weeks following the cessation of RAL therapy. All resistance-associated mutations were lost at 20 weeks after stopping RAL therapy. Our findings provide evidence supporting the supposition that substantial cross-resistance between strand transfer IN-Is is likely in HIV-2 as shown in HIV-1."

In this study, we experienced a case of repeated seroconversion to HBe antibody in a patient with chronic hepatitis B. Since seroconversion is considered to be related to genetic mutations, we investigated the HBV genes in this male patient in his 30's. We amplified and cloned parts of the HBV genes by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequenced the PCR products. As a result, mutated HBV genes were found in the serum of each specified period. By DNA sequencing we confirmed the coexistence of different HBV clones (wild-type clone and pre-S deletion mutant) and that both clones had the same genotype C. These clones took turns to be dominant; when the wild-type clone was dominant, HBe antigen was positive, and when the mutant clone was dominant, HBe antibody was positive. These findings demonstrated that repeated seroconversion of HBe antigen to HBe antibody was induced by co infection with mutant- and wild-type HBV clones. It is interesting that increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was noted at the time of the change from positive wild-type HBV clone to positive mutant clone."

Clinical symptom and increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level were detected when the prescription of DFO (30 mg/kg) was increased from 3 to 5 days/week; a raise in HBV-DNA levels of greater than or equal to tenfold compared with baseline was thereafter detected. Diagnosis was troublesome because increasing ALT levels, first suggested toxicity to DFP administration. However, HBV reactivation in our patient cannot be definitively attributed to combined regimen administration: the patient was on regular transfusion therapy and either coincidental further infection or spontaneous reactivation of HBV could not be completely ruled out. Furthermore, a background of immunologic abnormalities had been previously reported in thalassemia and postulated to be secondary to iron overload or DFO therapy itself."

Successive groups received three doses of vaccine (30, 100, or 300 microg) at 10-week intervals in a dose-escalation trial. Vaccine administration induced no local or systemic reactions, and no laboratory abnormalities were detected. Specifically, no patient developed anti-DNA antibody or muscle enzyme elevations. No consistent change occurred in CD4 or CD8 lymphocyte counts or in plasma HIV concentration. Antibody against gp120 increased in individual patients in the 100- and 300-/microg groups. Some increases were noted in cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity against gp160-bearing targets and in lymphocyte proliferative activity.

Military personnel are one of many core populations at increased risk for acquiring STDs. This study was designed to assess primary care physician/practitioner compliance with secondary screening recommendations and reporting practices of STDs in a military setting. Data from approximately 27,000 covered lives from the Naval Hospital and the Naval Air Station Branch Medical Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, were used in this analysis. Because chlamydia is the most prevalent STD, laboratory results indicative of infection with chlamydia from July 1 to December 31, 1996, were used as a marker of a patient population requiring additional (secondary) STD screening. Patients with laboratory-confirmed chlamydia infection were identified using the Composite Health Care System. The medical records of these index cases were then analyzed for the presence of laboratory test results of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), rapid plasma reagin, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) within 6 months of a positive chlamydia test. To assess compliance with mandated reporting of particular STDs, total laboratory-confirmed cases of chlamydia, syphilis, and HBV were compared with total cases reported to the Office of Preventive Medicine at the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, U.S. Navy, during a 1-year period from July 1, 1996, to June 30, 1997. In 32% of chlamydia cases, no additional laboratory tests for HIV, syphilis, or HBV were obtained within 6 months. Fourteen percent of chlamydia cases were reported to the Office of preventive Medicine. Compliance with screening for multiple STDs after the identification of a single STD should be improved. In addition, better methods for reporting cases of STDs should be implemented."
18478,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"In individuals with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, a small reservoir of resting memory CD4(+) T lymphocytes carrying latent, integrated provirus persists even in patients treated for prolonged periods with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This reservoir greatly complicates the prospects for eradicating HIV-1 infection with antiretroviral drugs. Therefore, it is critical to understand how HIV-1 latency is established and maintained. In particular, it is important to determine whether transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanisms are involved. Therefore, HIV-1 DNA and mRNAs were measured in highly purified populations of resting CD4(+) T lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of patients on long-term HAART. In such patients, the predominant form of persistent HIV-1 is latent integrated provirus. Typically, 100 HIV-1 DNA molecules were detected per 10(6) resting CD4(+) T cells. Only very low levels of unspliced HIV-1 RNA ( approximately 50 copies/10(6) resting CD4(+) T cells) were detected using a reverse transcriptase PCR assay capable of detecting a single molecule of RNA standard. Levels of multiply spliced HIV-1 RNA were below the limit of detection (<50 copies/10(6) cells). Only 1% of the HIV-1 DNA-positive lymphocytes in this compartment could be induced to up-regulate HIV-1 mRNAs after cellular activation, indicating that most of the proviral DNA in resting CD4(+) T cells either carries intrinsic defects precluding transcription or is subjected to transcriptional control mechanisms that preclude high-level production of multiply spliced mRNAs. Nevertheless, by inducing T-cell activation, it is possible to isolate replication-competent virus from resting CD4(+) T lymphocytes of all infected individuals, including those on prolonged HAART. Thus, a subset of integrated proviruses (1%) remains competent for high-level mRNA production after cellular activation, and a subset of these can produce infectious virus. Measurements of steady-state levels of multiply spliced and unspliced HIV-1 RNA prior to cellular activation suggest that infected resting CD4(+) T lymphocytes in blood synthesize very little viral RNA and are unlikely to be capable of producing virus. In these cells, latency appears to reflect regulation at the level of mRNA production rather than at the level of splicing or nuclear export of viral mRNAs."

Patient randomization was 2:1 to ENF plus OB (n = 663) and OB (n = 334), of which 89.7% and 89.8% were male, 89.3% and 88.6% were Caucasian, and median age was 41 and 42 years, respectively. HIV risk factors were comparable between the ENF plus OB and OB groups with the major factors being 65.2% versus 66.2% homosexual contact, 17.8% versus 19.8% heterosexual contact, 4.1% versus 4.8% bisexual contact, respectively, and 6.9% injection drug use in both groups. OB patients were allowed to switch to ENF plus OB at virologic failure before week 48 and required to switch at week 48 to continue in the study (n = 230). Efficacy and safety assessments were conducted for each group. At week 96, 55% of ENF plus OB subjects completed the study and 26.5% achieved a viral load of less than 400 copies per milliliter (17.5% achieved less than 50 copies per milliliter). Viral load and CD4 mean change from baseline was -2.1 and -1.1 log(10) HIV-1-RNA copies per milliliter and +166 and +116 CD4 cells/mm(3) for ENF plus OB and switch patients, respectively. No new ENF-related safety issues emerged in weeks 48-96. Injection site reactions led to discontinuation in 7% and 10% of ENF plus OB and switch patients, respectively. In conclusion, these data demonstrate durable efficacy and safety of ENF over 96 weeks and that early use of ENF in combination with other agents for the treatment of antiretroviral-experienced HIV-infected subjects is beneficial."

On two occasions (at 0 and 6 months), saliva was collected for anonymous HCV antibody testing and risk behavior data were obtained through a self-administered questionnaire. The participation rate was 85% at both initial recruitment (612/719) and follow-up (375/441; 171 men were ineligible for follow-up). For inmates who reported never having injected drugs, ever having injected drugs, having injected drugs during follow-up, and having shared needles/syringes during follow-up, HCV incidences per 100 person-years of incarceration risk were 1, 12, 19, and 27, respectively. Ever having injected drugs (relative risk = 13.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.5, 114.3) and having shared needles/syringes during follow-up (relative risk = 9.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 71.7) were significantly associated with HCV seroconversion. The effectiveness of existing interventions, including the provision of bleach tablets for sterilizing injection equipment, was suboptimal. The development of methadone maintenance programs in prisons and the creation of drug courts to keep offending drug injectors out of prison might help to reduce transmission in this setting."

Survival methods, including Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression models, were used to assess the effect of cigarette smoking on development of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), AIDS, death, and self-reported oral thrush. After adjustment for CD4+ lymphocyte count and use of antiretroviral and anti-PCP medications, smoking was not significantly associated with progression to PCP, AIDS, or death in either the HIV-seroprevalent or-seroincident cohort members. Among men who had baseline CD4+ cell counts > 200/microliter, smoking was associated with a 40% increase in the hazard of oral thrush (p < or = 0.01). These data indicate that cigarette smoking does not have a major effect on the progression of HIV-1 infection to AIDS or death but may affect the incidence of oral thrush."

The prevalence of TDR varies geographically, and its prevalence in Sweden during the last decade has not been reported. Plasma samples from 1,463 patients newly diagnosed with HIV-1 infection between 2003 and 2010, representing 44% of all patients diagnosed in Sweden during this period, were analyzed using the WHO 2009 list of mutations for surveillance of TDR. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were used to determine genetic subtype and to investigate the relatedness of the sequences. Eighty-two patients showed evidence of TDR, representing a prevalence of 5.6% (95% CI: 4.5%-6.9%) without any significant time trends or differences between patients infected in Sweden or abroad. Multivariable logistic regression showed that TDR was positively associated with men who have sex with men (MSM) and subtype B infection and negatively associated with CD4 cell counts. Among patients with TDR, 54 (68%) had single resistance mutations, whereas five patients had multi-drug resistant HIV-1. Phylogenetic analyses identified nine significantly supported clusters involving 29 of the patients with TDR, including 23 of 42 (55%) of the patients with TDR acquired in Sweden. One cluster contained 18 viruses with a M41L resistance mutation, which had spread among MSM in Stockholm over a period of at least 16 years (1994-2010). Another cluster, which contained the five multidrug resistant viruses, also involved MSM from Stockholm. The prevalence of TDR in Sweden 2003-2010 was lower than in many other European countries. TDR was concentrated among MSM, where clustering of TDR strains was observed, which highlights the need for continued and improved measures for targeted interventions."

Antiretroviral-naïve subjects with HIV-1 RNA levels >1000 copies/ml were randomized to LPV/r QD (N = 333) or BID (N = 331) with tenofovir DF and emtricitabine. Through 96 weeks, 77 subjects from each group discontinued prematurely; adverse or HIV-related events contributed to discontinuation of 36 subjects overall, with no significant differences between treatment groups. At 96 weeks, 216 QD subjects (64.9%) and 229 BID subjects (69.2%) had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml (p = 0.249) by intent-to-treat analysis. Evaluation of the time to virologic failure indicated that 85.0% and 80.7% of QD and BID subjects, respectively, maintained virologic suppression through 96 weeks (p = 0.638). QD subjects demonstrated greater adherence levels. There were no significant differences in virologic response when subjects were analyzed according to baseline disease state. Emergence of postbaseline resistance mutations occurred at similar low rates in each dosing group. Diarrhea was the most common moderate-to-severe drug-related adverse event reported; the most common Grade 3+ laboratory abnormalities were elevations of total cholesterol and triglycerides, occurring with similar incidence regardless of LPV/r dosing frequency. QD dosing of LPV/r was associated with similar durability of viral suppression and low rates of genotypic resistance and treatment-limiting adverse events as compared with BID dosing in treatment-naïve subjects through 96 weeks of treatment."

All patients with HIV infection should be considered for antiretroviral therapy, regardless of CD4 count or HIV viral load, for individual benefit and to prevent HIV transmission. Antiretroviral drugs affect HIV in several ways: entry inhibitors block HIV entry into CD4 T cells; nucleotide and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors prevent reverse transcription from RNA to DNA via chain-terminating proteins; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors prevent reverse transcription through enzymatic inhibition; integrase strand transfer inhibitors block integration of viral DNA into cellular DNA; protease inhibitors block maturation and production of the virus. Current guidelines recommend six combination regimens for initial therapy. Five are based on tenofovir and emtricitabine; the other uses abacavir and lamivudine. Five include integrase strand transfer inhibitors. HIV specialists should assist with treating patients with complicated HIV infection, including patients with treatment-resistant HIV infection, coinfection with hepatitis B or C virus, pregnancy, childhood infections, severe opportunistic infections, complex drug interactions, significant drug toxicity, or comorbidities. Family physicians can treat most patients with HIV infection effectively by choosing appropriate treatment regimens, monitoring patients closely, and retaining patients in care. "

Thirty patients were randomly assigned to either oxymetholone monotherapy (n 14) or oxymetholone plus ketotifen (n 16). Patients receiving treatment were compared with a group of thirty untreated matched controls, who met the same inclusion criteria. Body weight and the Karnofsky index, which assesses the ability to perform activities of daily life, and several quality-of-life variables were measured to evaluate response to therapy. The average weight gain at peak was 8.2 (SD 6.2) kg (+ 14.5% of body weight at study entry) in the oxymetholone group (P < 0.001), and 6.1 (SD 4.6) kg (+10.9%) in the combination group (P < 0.005), compared with an average weight loss of 1.8 (SD 0.7) kg in the untreated controls. The mean time to peak weight was 19.6 weeks in the monotherapy group and 20.8 weeks in the combination group. The Karnofsky index improved equally in both groups from 56% before to 67% after 20 weeks of treatment (P < 0.05). The quality of life variables (activities of daily life, and appetite/nutrition) improved in 68% (P < 0.05) and 91% (P < 0.01) of the treated patients respectively. Oxymetholone was safe and promoted weight gain in cachectic patients with advanced HIV-1 infection. The addition of ketotifen did not further support weight gain.

We investigated the prevalence of HGV in 40 adult Italian patients with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia and evaluated the clinical significance of HGV infection. HGV-RNA was detected in 9/40 patients (22.5%). HGV infection was significantly associated with HCV viraemia (P = 0.0012), with all patients positive for HGV being also viraemic for HCV. Overall, the clinical picture of patients with HCV/HGV co-infection was not different from that of patients with isolated HCV. However, patients co-infected with both viruses had lower values of alanine-transferase (P = 0.035) and a lower titre of HCV viraemia (P = 0.042) in the absence of other evident factors which could influence the clinical expression of HCV infection. In conclusion, HGV is highly prevalent among Italian polytransfused patients. No evidence of a clinically significant pathogenic role for HGV in liver disease could be found in these patients. In a subset of cases a possible interference of HGV with HCV infection was observed."

HCV RNA determination by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and virus typing were performed in a subsample of anti-HCV-positive specimens (n=135). Of the IVDUs, 83% were anti-HCV-positive, 18% HIV-infected, and 58% HBV (anti-HBc)-positive. Longer duration of intravenous drug use, syringe sharing in prison, and higher number of IDVU sex partners were independent risk factors for anti-HCV positivity. GCV RNA was detected in 76% of anti-HCV-positive IVDUs. HCV genotypes 1 (49%) and 3 (44%) were most commonly found. All the type 3 isolates were identified as subtype 3a, and 95% of the type 1 isolates as subtype 1b. In logistic regression analysis, HCV type 3a viraemia was significantly associated with lack of HIV infection and a higher number of sex partners. The results indicate that preventive measures are needed to reduce syringe sharing among IVDUs in prisons. Sexual contacts with other IVDUs may play a role in the HCV epidemic among IVDUs. In Germany, HCV type 3a infection appears to be much more common among IVDUs than among other HCV risk groups such as transfusion recipients or haemophiliacs."

To better characterize serosilent HCV infection, the authors prospectively tested 131 HIV-positive persons and 102 HIV-negative control subjects with diabetes for the presence of HCV antibody (Ab) and HCV RNA. Thirty of 31 HCV Ab-positive (AbP) HIV-positive people tested positive for HCV RNA as did both HCV AbP, HIV-negative control subjects. Similarly, none of the 100 HIV-negative, HCV Ab-negative (AbN) control subjects was HCV RNA positive (p<.001). In contrast, 19 of 100 HIV-positive, HCV AbN persons met stringent criteria for HCV viremia, and 9 of these 19 people were HCV RNA positive when tested by a commercially available HCV RNA detection method. The mean duration of HCV viremia in HCV AbN people was 26.8 months (range, 1-99 months). None of the subjects developed HCV antibody during the study. The HIV-positive, HCV AbP, and RNA-positive group was significantly more likely to have acquired HIV parenterally (p<.001), have higher initial CD4 counts (p=.029), and have higher ALT values than the HCV AbN group (p<.002). In summary, HCV infection appears to occur more frequently among HIV-infected, HCV-seronegative persons than appreciated, especially if HIV acquisition was through sexual as opposed to parenteral risk factors and was associated with a lower initial CD4 count and lower ALT values."

The prevalence of HGV infection was similar in HD and CAPD patients (9.8% vs. 12.7%), while that of HCV infection was significantly higher in HD patients compared to CAPD patients (16.4% vs. 1.3%, p < 0.05).

In both HD and CAPD patients, the presence of HGV RNA was not related to age, sex, duration of dialysis, history of transfusion, history of hepatitis, or to the presence of HBV or HCV markers. There was no significant difference in the clinical and biochemical data between patients with isolated HGV infection (n = 12) and patients without viremia (n = 106). The clinical feature of patients coinfected with HGV and HBV (n = 2), or HGV and HCV (n = 2) seemed to be similar to those of patients with isolated HBV (n = 8) or HCV (n = 9) infection. In conclusion, the prevalence of HGV infection was not different between HD and CAPD patients, and HGV infections did not seem to be associated with clinically significant hepatitis.

However, the ultrastructural demonstration of HBV particles in this mouse model has not as yet been reported. In our study, plasmid DNA containing wild-type HBV DNA was rapidly injected into 8-week-old female SCID mice via the tail vein. Serum levels of HBsAg were measured by ELISA kit. Intrahepatic HBV protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry of HBcAg. Ultrastructural study of the serum samples was performed by transmission electron microscopy and immunogold electron microscopy. Serum HBsAg and intrahepatic HBcAg were detected in HBV DNA-injected mice for at least 14 days. Spherical and filamentous particles 22 nm in diameter and double-shelled Dane-like particles 42 nm in diameter were detected in the sera of mice. The ultrastructural features of these particles were identical to HBV particles observed in serum from chronic hepatitis B patients. These particles were confirmed to be HBV particles by immunogold electron microscopy. We conclude that our present HBV mouse model using hydrodynamic transfection of HBV DNA is appropriate for production of HBV virions including Dane particles.

However, these approaches are associated with the development of acquired drug resistance or poor response rates and are accompanied by numerous side effects. Furthermore, due to defective innate and adaptive immune responses, HBV cannot be effectively controlled or completely eliminated, which may ultimately result in liver decompensation and hepatocelluar carcinoma. The imperative for development of new approaches targeting CHB cannot be overstated. Various immunotherapeutic interventions have been tried as adjuvants to inhibit HBV replication. In this paper, we will review immunotherapeutic interventions in the treatment of CHB. "

ARL-derived immunoglobulin (Ig) genes are significantly diversified from germline, suggesting that antigenic stimulation via Ig receptors may occur prior to malignant transformation. We have evaluated 6 ARL-derived antibodies for binding to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cell surface epitopes. Five cases expressed IgM, and 1 case expressed IgG. Expressed V genes were significantly diversified (3%-15%) from known germline V genes. A non-Ig producing mouse myeloma cell line was transfected with expression vectors containing the lymphoma-derived V genes. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot assay, the lymphoma-derived Ig's showed no reactivity against HIV recombinant proteins. Also, no specific HIV reactivity was observed by flow cytometry with lymphoma-derived Ig's against the T-cell line infected with T-tropic HIV-1 or peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with M-tropic HIV strains, indicating lack of binding to native HIV epitopes. However, 2 of the lymphoma-derived Ig's (ARL-7 and ARL-14) bound strongly to non-HIV-infected cells of various tissue origins. Thus, these findings suggest that the transformed B cells of AIDS-associated lymphomas may not arise from the pool of anti-HIV specific B cells but, rather, may develop from B cells responding to other antigens, including self-antigens.

They also promote expansion of already activated memory T cells. By contrast, macrophages (M phi) are only effective in stimulating memory responses. Infection and depletion of DC occur in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and recruitment of T cells into primary responses is blocked. Here comparisons between DC and M phi in stimulating secondary T-cell responses in HIV infection were made. Adherent M phi, and DC isolated by a new method, were separated from peripheral blood of patients in different stages of HIV infection and from uninfected controls and added to allogeneic lymphocytes in mixed leucocyte reactions (MLR). Some were pulsed with influenza virus or tetanus toxoid and used to stimulate autologous T cells. Responses were measured from uptake of [3H]thymidine in 20 microliters hanging drop cultures. DC, but not M phi, from normal individuals stimulated MLR but both populations stimulated secondary responses to recall antigens. DC from all HIV seropositive individuals caused little or no stimulation of any lymphocyte responses. However, M phi from HIV seropositive asymptomatic individuals and those with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy stimulated responses to recall antigens. There was no stimulation using cells from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Blocked DC but not M phi function may underlie progressive immunological non-responsiveness in HIV infection. Without recruitment of resting T cells, loss of memory T cells may be cumulative; failure of secondary activation (e.g. by M phi) would lead to lost T-cell activity. Identification and circumvention of the defect in DC could offer new therapeutic approaches."

This study was performed to explore the feasibility of vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) gag gene via oocyte. The recombinant plasmid (pIRES2-EGFP-gag) was injected into mouse ovaries to transfect germ cells. Induction of superovulation and then animal mating were performed to collect oocytes and two-cell embryos. Positive FISH signals for HIV-1 gag DNA were detected in the nuclei of oocytes and embryos, and in chromosomes of mature oocytes, indicated integration of the gene into the oocyte genome and gene replication in the embryo. HIV-1 gag cDNA positive bands detected by RT-PCR in oocytes and embryos indicated successful gene transcription, while positive immunofluorescence signals for HIV-1 gag protein indicated successful translation in both oocytes and embryos. The HIV-1 gag gene was transmitted vertically to the next generation via oocytes and it retained its function in replication, transcription and translation following at least one mitotic division in embryos."

By progressively crippling the body's immune system, HIV allows opportunistic infections, which account for approximately 90% of AIDS-related deaths, to develop. In a recently published controlled study conducted by the National Institute for Child Health and Development (N Eng J Med 1991:325:73-80), children who received monthly infusions of IVIG experienced significantly more time free of infection. Home administration of IVIG is safe, convenient, and cost-effective. The first dose of IVIG, however, is administered in a hospital or clinic under physician supervision. Mild side effects occur in approximately 3% to 5% of patients; at least 90% of these effects are related to the infusion rate. In this article, a suggested protocol for home administration including commonly reported side effects and precautionary measures of anaphylaxis is presented."

In the present study, we used a relevant rhesus macaque model of infection with simian immunodeficiency virus from sooty mangabey (SIVsm) to evaluate the effect of TRIM5α restriction on clinical outcome. For macaques expressing a restrictive TRIM5 genotype, the disease outcomes of those infected with the wild-type TRIM-sensitive SIVsm strain and those infected with a virus with escape mutations in the capsid were compared. We found that TRIM5α restriction significantly delayed disease progression and improved the survival rate of SIV-infected macaques, supporting the feasibility of exploiting TRIM5α as a target for gene therapy against HIV-1. Furthermore, we also found that preservation of memory CD4 T cells was associated with protection by TRIM5α restriction, suggesting memory CD4 T cells or their progenitor cells as an ideal target for gene modification. Despite the significant effect of TRIM5α restriction on survival, SIV escape from TRIM5α restriction was also observed; therefore, this may not be an effective stand-alone strategy and may require combination with other targets."

In 1990, he underwent radiation, chemotherapy, and ultimately, a unilateral nephrectomy for Wilms' tumor. Because of previous reports of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-induced nephrotoxicity, our objective was to evaluate and monitor our patient's renal function over the course of 19 months based on serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance using the Cockroft-Gault equation, estimated glomerular filtration rate using the modification of diet in renal disease formula and urinalyses. After experiencing gastrointestinal side effects from other antiretroviral agents, our patient was switched to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in June 2013. At baseline, his serum creatinine was 1.35 mg/dL, estimated creatinine clearance 68.7 mL/min (based on actual body weight of 71.8 kg), estimated glomerular filtration rate 72.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2), with a CD4 cell count of 119 cells/mm(3) (5%) and an undetectable HIV viral load. In March 2015, his weight was 73.2 kg, serum creatinine 1.42 mg/dL, estimated creatinine clearance 65.2 mL/min, estimated glomerular filtration rate 68.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2), with a CD4 cell count of 120 cells/mm(3) (10%) and an undetectable HIV viral load. Other authors have reported tenofovir-induced nephrotoxicity in patients with a solitary kidney. Our patient had no evidence of nephrotoxicity over the course of 19 months on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based antiretroviral therapy (ART). He maintained adequate renal function, comparable to his baseline renal function. Our case report suggests that a tenofovir disoproxil fumurate-based ART may be a viable option for some patients with a solitary kidney.

Trials and implementation projects demonstrate preexposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention is effective in women. Preexposure prophylaxis is a method of preventing HIV acquisition by having an HIV-negative individual take antiretroviral medication before exposure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate coformulated with emtricitabine as preexposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention in 2012. Preexposure prophylaxis is highly dependent on adherence for effectiveness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends offering preexposure prophylaxis to individuals at significant risk of infection and estimates 468,000 women in the United States are eligible for preexposure prophylaxis. Although variable individual and structural forces affect each woman's medication adherence, and therefore the effectiveness of preexposure prophylaxis, women's health care providers are uniquely positioned to screen, counsel about, and offer preexposure prophylaxis. Shared decision-making provides a framework for these clinical encounters, allowing patients and clinicians to make health care decisions together based on scientific evidence and patient experiences. By incorporating fertility desires and contraceptive needs, health care providers effectively integrate sexual and reproductive health care. Including preexposure prophylaxis in women's health services requires health care provider training and attention to lessons learned from family planning and HIV prevention. Nevertheless, obstetrician-gynecologists have an opportunity to play a critical role in reducing sexual transmission of HIV in the United States by integrating preexposure prophylaxis education and provision into their practices."
5838,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Recent studies have shown that rosuvastatin significantly decreases serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers and slows progression of carotid atherosclerosis in the general population. However, there are no data about its effect on progression of atherosclerosis in HIV-infected patients. Adult patients with HIV infection, on stable antiretroviral therapy, with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia, who started a rosuvastatin treatment at 10 mg daily during the period 2007-2009 were enrolled and followed-up for 24 months. Thirty-six patients (30 males) were enrolled, with a mean age of 49 years, a mean duration of current antiretroviral therapy of 38 months, and a mean 10-year risk of myocardial infarction of 18.5%. Rosuvastatin led to a significant decrease in mean values of intima-media thickness in all extracranial carotid arteries, with the greatest magnitude observed in carotid bifurcations (a mean decrease of 18.7% in the right artery and of 21.4% in the left artery) and in internal carotid arteries (a mean decrease of 23.7% in the right artery and of 25.6% in the left artery). Moreover, there was a significant reduction in mean levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides versus respective baseline values associated with a significantly decreased mean cardiovascular risk. The treatment with rosuvastatin was well tolerated, and serious adverse events were not reported. A 24-month treatment with rosuvastatin in HIV-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with subclinical atherosclerosis and a moderate cardiovascular risk seems to promote significantly favorable changes in carotid atherosclerosis, associated with a favorable effect on serum lipid levels and a good tolerability profile."

Study participants were 178 adolescent females age 15-24, enrolled between 2003-2005, from 5 different cities and 60 provided adherence information. Findings reported by this cohort of 60 adolescent women included: medication adherence, 64.3% reporting adherence at baseline and 45.0% at 12 months; HIV stigma score of 57.60 (standard deviation [SD], 11.83; range, 25-86). HIV stigma was not found to be a significant predictor when binary logit regression was run with medication adherence at 1 year. Using moderational analysis, factors that could moderate stigma's effect on medication adherence was still pursued and identified the following to be significant at 12 months: health care satisfaction (B = -0.020, standard error [SE] = 0.010, p < .05); and Coping (proactive coping strategies [B = 0.012, SE = 0.005, p < .05]; turning to family [B = 0.012, SE = 0.016, p < 0.05]; spiritual coping [B = 0.021, SE = 0.010, p < 0.05]; professional help [B = 0.021, SE = 0.010, p < 0.05]; physical diversions [B = 0.016, SE = 0.007, p < 0.05]). Factors that had no significant moderating effects included: social support measures (mean = 74.9; median = 74.0) and depression score greater than 16 = 43%. We conclude that HIV-infected adolescent women experience HIV stigma and poor adherence over time. Factors like health care satisfaction and coping may minimize stigma's effect on medication adherence. Our findings are tempered by a small sample size and lack of a direct relationship between stigma and adherence on binary logit regression analysis."

In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), while PROs are used in research, their application in clinical practice has been limited despite their potential utility. PRO selection is an important consideration when contemplating their use. As past reviews of PROs in HIV have focused on particular areas (e.g. disability, satisfaction with care), a more comprehensive review could better inform on the available instruments and their scope. This article reviews HIV-specific PROs to produce an inventory and to identify the central concepts targeted over time. Seven databases were searched (HAPI, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar), generating 14,794 records for evaluation. From these records, 117 HIV-specific PROs were identified and categorized based on a content analysis of their targeted concept: Health-Related Quality of Life (23; 20 %), ART and Adherence-Related Views and Experiences (19; 16 %), Healthcare-Related Views and Experiences (15; 13 %), Psychological Challenges (12; 10 %), Symptoms (12; 10 %), Psychological Resources (10; 9 %), HIV Self-Management and Self-Care (8; 7 %), HIV-Related Stigma (8; 7 %), Body and Facial Appearance (4; 3 %), Social Support (3; 3 %), Sexual and Reproductive Health (2; 2 %), and Disability (1; 1 %). This review highlights the variety and evolution of HIV-specific PROs, with the arrival of seven categories of PROs only after the advent of highly-active antiretroviral therapy. Our inventory also offers a useful resource. However, the interest of further HIV-specific PRO development should be explored in sexual health, which received little independent attention."

Patient demographics, receipt of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), reason for ICU admission and survival to ICU and hospital discharge were recorded. Comparison was made against outcomes for general medical patients contemporaneously admitted to the same ICU. One hundred and ninety-two HIV-infected patients had 222 ICU admissions; 116 patients required mechanical ventilation (MV) and 43 required renal replacement therapy. ICU admission was due to an HIV-associated diagnosis in 113 patients; 37 had Pneumocystis pneumonia. Survival to ICU discharge and hospital discharge for HIV-infected patients was 78% and 70%, respectively, and was 75% and 68% among 2065 general medical patients with 2274 ICU admissions; P = 0.452 and P = 0.458, respectively. HIV infection was newly diagnosed in 42 patients; their ICU and hospital survival was 69% and 57%, respectively. From multivariable analysis, factors associated with ICU survival were patient's age (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53-1.02] per 10-year increase), albumin (OR = 1.05 [1.00-1.09] per 1 g/dL increase), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (OR = 0.55 [0.35-0.87] per 10 unit increase), receipt of HAART (OR = 2.44 [1.01-4.94]) and need for MV (OR = 0.14 [0.06-0.36]).

Using a case presentation format, we present an overview of some of the major issues involved in delivering effective primary care for these individuals. A detailed medical and substance use history is critical to sort common complaints that can be seen both in HIV infection and with drug use. Physicians must be able to recognize withdrawal syndromes and differentiate those signs and symptoms that may be attributed to specific drugs. A two-phase model of drug abuse treatment takes into account both detoxification and maintenance of abstinence. Primary care physicians should be able to initiate the process of substance abuse treatment and refer the patient to appropriate substance abuse programs when necessary. Pharmacological approaches to long-term abstinence with heroin addiction include methadone, LAAM, and naltrexone. While clinically challenging, HIV-infected substance users can be successfully managed using the general principles of primary care."

Yet many patients for whom HAART is indicated do not receive it. This study investigated the reasons why certain patients of a community health center with HIV/AIDS did not receive HAART between 1997 and 1998. Medical record reviews were performed to determine which patients for whom HAART was indicated (according to United States Public Health Service guidelines) were not prescribed HAART. Chart reviews and patient interviews were conducted to determine why they did not receive HAART. Of the 88 patients eligible for HAART, 60 (69%) had it prescribed in 1997-1998. Of the remaining 28 patients, 3 did not receive HAART because their provider never discussed it with them. For 6 patients (21%), the provider discussed HAART but did not recommend it; 16 patients (57%) declined HAART although their provider recommended it, and 3 (11%) accepted their provider's recommendation but never started HAART. Patients' most common reasons for refusing HAART were not being ready for strict adherence to a complex regimen (7/16) and fear of side effects (6/16). Other reasons included active drug use, religious beliefs, homelessness, confidentiality concerns, depression, and feeling well without HAART. Providers did not recommend HAART because of active drug use (4/6), lack of engagement with care (2/6) as well as homelessness, depression, and the perception that the patient was doing well without HAART. Providers should be trained to offer all patients the opportunity to develop a plan to address barriers to adherence and the support needed to implement it. Resources should also target the treatment of substance abuse and mental illness to improve the usage of HAART."

To help inform development of interventions to enhance ART access, we explored barriers to free ART access at government ART centers for IDUs living with HIV in Chennai by conducting three focus groups (n = 19 IDUs) and four key informant interviews. Data were explored using framework analysis to identify categories and derive themes. We found interrelated barriers at the family and social, health-care system, and individual levels. Family and social level barriers included lack of family support and fear of societal discrimination, as well as unmet basic needs, including food and shelter. Health-care system barriers included actual or perceived unfriendly hospital environment and procedures such as requiring proof of address and identity from PLHIV, including homeless IDUs; provider perception that IDUs will not adhere to ART, resulting in ART not being initiated; actual or perceived inadequate counseling services and lack of confidentiality; and lack of effective linkages between ART centers, needle/syringe programs, and drug dependence treatment centers. Individual-level barriers included active drug use, lack of self-efficacy in ART adherence, low motivation to initiate ART stemming from a fatalistic attitude, and inadequate knowledge about ART. These findings indicate that to facilitate IDUs gaining access to ART, systemic changes are needed, including steps to make the environment and procedures at government ART centers more IDU-friendly and steps to decrease HIV- and drug use-related stigma and discrimination faced by IDUs from the general public and health-care providers. Housing support for homeless IDUs and linkage of IDUs with drug dependence treatment are also essential."

The French APROCO cohort gave us the opportunity to conjointly analyse the relationships between short-term adherence to HAART and HIV-infected patients' characteristics before initiation of treatment on the one hand, factors related to patients' subjective experience with HAART on the other hand. At the fourth-month follow-up visit (M4) after first prescription of HAART (M0), 26.7% of our sample of 445 patients self-reported non-adherence behaviour. Some patients' characteristics at M0 (younger age, poor housing conditions, lack of social support, and problems of adherence with previous antiretroviral regimens) were related to non-adherence at M4 in multivariate analysis. Non-adherence at M4 was, however, also related to the evolutions that affected a number of factors between M0 and M4: levels of depression, symptoms associated with treatment side effects, perception of individual state of health, beliefs towards effectiveness and toxicity of HAART. increases in alcohol and tobacco consumption, as well as contacts with other physicians than hospital HAART prescribers. Our prospective study brings additional evidence that even short-term non-adherence cannot be reliably predicted on the sole basis of a few a priori patient characteristics that clinicians could easily identify before initiation of HAART. It suggests that a dynamic approach to adherence, continuously monitoring the impact of experience with HAART on patients' daily lives, is needed for improving management of HIV/AIDS care."

We included 206 patients; with males representing the majority of them (85%). Risk factors for HIV acquisition were unprotected sexual intercourse (homo/bisexual in 39.8% and heterosexual in 60.2%). Thirty-nine patients (18.9%) were previous injection drug users, while 41 (19.9%) were alcohol abusers. Mean education was 11.1 years (SD--standard deviation--3.7). A high prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND, 47.1%) was present in HIV-infected patients: particularly, asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI) was found in 30.6%, mild neurocognitive disorder (MND) in 15% and HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in 1.5%. Male gender, low degree of education, AIDS diagnosis and gepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection were factors independently associated with HAND in a multivariable logistic regression model. Our data suggest that patient-specific factors and AIDS diagnosis have a certain kind of impact in HAND occurrence.

Of the subjects, 205 (48.8%) men were HIV-seropositive and 215 (51.2%) men were HIV-seronegative. Although there was an appreciable level of condom usage in both groups, 13.5% of the HIV-seronegative men had engaged in unprotected receptive anal intercourse and 6.3% of the HIV-seropositive men had engaged in unprotected insertive anal intercourse. Condom breakage was reported on approximately 6% of occasions by a minority of subjects. Among subjects who were in a relationship with a regular male sexual partner, the most commonly reported sexual practices were deep kissing, mutual masturbation and receptive oral intercourse without ejaculation. No HIV-seronegative man engaged in unprotected receptive and/or insertive anal intercourse, receptive oral intercourse with ejaculation or receptive and/or insertive ""fisting"" with a regular partner who was HIV-seropositive. No HIV-seropositive man engaged in unprotected insertive anal intercourse to ejaculation with an HIV-seronegative partner, although they did so with partners who were HIV-seropositive or of unknown status. On multivariate analyses the subject's antibody status was found to be associated with receptive anal intercourse with a condom (P = 0.007) and mutual masturbation (P = 0.001), with HIV-seronegative men being more likely to practise either; no significant independent effect was associated with the partner's antibody status. These findings provide important information on the types and levels of sexual practices in a group of homosexual men after the recognition of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in this country."

All known Slovenian HIV-infected ART-naïve and treated males (infected or treated > 12 months) were invited to participate in a cross-sectional study. Data were collected on age, BMI, waist-hip ratio, family history of hip fracture, duration of infection, duration of ART, smoking, alcohol, exercise, viral load and CD4+ cells. BMD was measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry. A total of 96 patients (out of 133 who fulfilled the inclusion criteria) were assessed and allocated into three groups: group A (n = 24), ART-naïve; group B1 (n = 37), treated with non-protease-inhibitor (PI) containing ART; and group B2 (n = 35), treated with PI-containing ART. The prevalence of osteopenia/osteoporosis was 57/96 (59%): osteopenia 45/96 (47%) and osteoporosis 12/96 (12%). Significantly lower BMD was detected in group A (P = 0.020). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed ART to be an independent negative predictor for reduced BMD (P = 0.037; OR = 0.29, 95%CI 0.09-0.93). Vitamin D(3) deficiency was detected in 79 (82%) of the patients. The study group represented 72% of the national HIV-infected male population; this proportion being higher than in any other study reported to date. The prevalence of reduced BMD was notably higher than the national prevalence among men of comparable age. There was no association between reduced BMD and any specific ART. According to our results, absence of ART was confirmed as an independent predictor of osteopenia/osteoporosis. Targeted screening and early treatment present a reasonable strategy for preventing reduced BMD in HIV-infected patients, but correcting vitamin D(3) levels could also be an important component."

In bivariate analyses, ""too many pills to take"" (OR=0.43, p<0.001), ""wanted to avoid side effects"" (OR=0.54, p=0.001), ""felt drug was toxic/harmful"" (OR=0.44, p<0.001), ""felt sick or ill"" (OR=0.49, p<0.001), ""felt depressed/overwhelmed"" (OR=0.58, p=0.004), and ""problem taking pills at specified time"" (OR=0.71, p=0.04) were associated with a lower odds of an undetectable HIV RNA. ""Too many pills to take,"" ""wanted to avoid side effects,"" ""felt drug was toxic/harmful,"" ""felt sick/ill,"", and ""felt depressed/overwhelmed"" had the highest relative importance in explaining virologic detectability. ""Simply forgot"" was not associated with HIV RNA (OR=0.99, p=0.95) and was ninth in its relative importance. Adherence interventions should prioritize barriers with highest importance in explaining virologic outcomes rather than focusing on more commonly reported barriers. "

In the current study, we explored predictors and sequelae among a group of Chinese PLWHA to guide future program strategies and enhance the repertoire of action for both preventative and clinical purposes. Between October 2012 and August 2013, we conducted a cross-sectional study in Guangxi Autonomous Region (Guangxi) of China. With an overall participation rate of 90%, we finally recruited 3002 patients with 2987 (99.5%) completed the survey and were included in the data analysis. We employed both predictive and explanatory modeling strategies to explore predictors and sequelae of co-infections among PLWHA. The overall prevalence of co-infection was 15.6% with 4.4% of HBV, 5.4% of HCV and 4.8% of TB, respectively. Predictors of co-infections included history of injecting drugs or drinking alcohol, sharing needles, having sex with sex workers or casual partners, higher viral loads and lower CD4 counts. Meanwhile, co-infections were associated with various physical and psychological problems among PLWHA. As an entangled phenomenon, co-infections among PLWHA produce continuous and shifting scenarios, which add complexity to clinic, epidemiological and political ways of dealing with health risks among PLWHA in China. Exploring predictors and sequelae can help to prevent and manage co-infection comorbidities among PLWHA."

A retrospective analysis used blood specimens and clinical data from three nevirapine containing arms of a four-arm, open-label, randomized trial comparing ART regimens in HIV-1-infected children who had failed mono- or dual-nucleoside therapy. Sensitive assays compared cell-associated HIV-1 DNA concentrations and nevirapine (NVP) and lamivudine (3TC) resistance mutations in children with plasma HIV-1 RNA <400 copies(c)/ml who did or did not experience subsequent virologic failure. Forty-six children were analyzed through the last available follow-up specimen, collected at 48 (n=16) or 96 (n=30) weeks of ART. Thirty-five (76%) had sustained viral suppression and 11 (24%) had plasma viral rebound to ≥ 400 c/ml (virologic failure detected at a median of 36 weeks). HIV-1 DNA levels at baseline, 24, 48, and 96 weeks of ART were similar in children who did vs. did not experience virologic failure (p=0.82). HIV-1 DNA levels did not increase prior to viral rebound. NVP resistance mutations were detected in 91% of subjects in the failure group vs. 3% in the suppressed group (p <0.0001). Among nine evaluable children, NVP mutations were first detected prior to virologic failure in two (22%), at viral rebound in five (56%), and after failure in two (22%) children. HIV-1 DNA concentrations did not predict virologic failure in this cohort. New drug resistance mutations were detected in the PBMCs of a minority of virologically suppressed children who subsequently failed ART."

Two types of interventions were assessed: use of either the immunosuppressive drug prednisolone or an HIV-1 envelope-targeted toxin (sCD4-PE40). Both agents inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced p24 expression by splenocytes in vitro and, when administered to transgenic mice, suppressed the induction of plasma p24, as well as the ex vivo production of p24 and infectious virus stimulated by in vivo infection with Mycobacterium avium. Moreover, HIV-1 mRNA levels in the spleen were greatly reduced in mice treated with either agent. Because HIV-1 expression cannot be induced in T lymphocytes from line 166 mice, this model may be of particular advantage for testing interventions that target virus production by non-T cell virus reservoirs."

Here we show that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones and cell lines derived from infected persons and targeting diverse epitopes differ by over 1,000-fold in their ability to retard infectious virus replication in autologous CD4 T cells during a 7-day period in vitro, despite comparable activity as assessed by gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. Cell lines derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated in vitro with peptides representing targeted Gag epitopes consistently neutralized HIV better than Env-specific lines from the same person, although ineffective inhibition of virus replication is not a universal characteristic of Env-specific responses at the clonal level. Gag-specific cell lines were of higher avidity than Env-specific lines, although avidity did not correlate with the ability of Gag- or Env-specific lines to contain HIV replication. The greatest inhibition was observed with cell lines restricted by the protective HLA alleles B*27 and B*57, but stimulation with targeted Gag epitopes resulted in greater inhibition than did stimulation with targeted Env epitopes even in non-B*27/B*57 subjects. These results assessing functional virus neutralization by HIV-specific CD8 T cells indicate that there are marked epitope- and allele-specific differences in virus neutralization by in vitro-expanded CD8 T cells, a finding not revealed by standard IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay currently in use in vaccine trials, which may be of critical importance in immunogen design and testing of candidate AIDS vaccines."
8275,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) interacts with the immune system throughout the course of infection. For most of the disease process, HIV activates the immune system, and the degree of activation can be assessed by measuring serum levels of molecules such as beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin, as well as other serum and cell surface phenotype markers. The levels of some of these markers correlate with clinical progression of HIV disease, and these markers may be useful as surrogate markers for development of clinical AIDS. Because the likelihood and timing of development of clinical AIDS following seroconversion, for any particular individual, are not readily predictable, the use of nonclinical disease markers has become critically important to patient management. Surrogate markers of HIV infection are, by definition, measurable traits that correlate with disease progression. An ideal marker should identify patients at highest risk of disease progression, provide information on how long an individual has been infected, help in staging HIV disease, predict development of opportunistic infections associated with AIDS, monitor the therapeutic efficacy of immunomodulating or antiviral treatments, and the easily quantifiable, reliable, clinically available, and affordable. This review examines the current state of knowledge and the role of surrogate markers in the natural history and treatment of HIV infection. The clinical usefulness of each marker is assessed with respect to the criteria outlined for the ideal surrogate marker for HIV disease progression."

The reasons for the limited efficacy of ART in the brain are unknown. Here we used functional genomics to determine ART effectiveness in the brain and to identify molecular signatures of HAND under ART. We performed genome-wide microarray analysis using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays, real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry in brain tissues from seven treated and eight untreated HAND patients and six uninfected controls. We also determined brain virus burdens by real-time PCR. Treated and untreated HAND brains had distinct gene expression profiles with ART transcriptomes clustering with HIV-1-negative controls. The molecular disease profile of untreated HAND showed dysregulated expression of 1470 genes at p<0.05, with activation of antiviral and immune responses and suppression of synaptic transmission and neurogenesis. The overall brain transcriptome changes in these patients were independent of histological manifestation of HIV-1 encephalitis and brain virus burdens. Depending on treatment compliance, brain transcriptomes from patients on ART had 83% to 93% fewer dysregulated genes and significantly lower dysregulation of biological pathways compared to untreated patients, with particular improvement indicated for nervous system functions. However a core of about 100 genes remained similarly dysregulated in both treated and untreated patient brain tissues. These genes participate in adaptive immune responses, and in interferon, cell cycle, and myelin pathways. Fluctuations of cellular gene expression in the brain correlated in Pearson's formula analysis with plasma but not brain virus burden. Our results define for the first time an aberrant genome-wide brain transcriptome of untreated HAND and they suggest that antiretroviral treatment can be broadly effective in reducing pathophysiological changes in the brain associated with HAND. Aberrantly expressed transcripts common to untreated and treated HAND may contribute to neurocognitive changes defying ART."

However, short and long term problems associated with HAART have led to proposals for alternative treatment strategies for controlling HIV infection. In particular, structured treatment interruptions (STIs) that consist of therapy withdrawal and re-initiation according to specific criteria have been considered. The aim of these STIs was one or both of: (i) to stimulate the immune system to react to HIV, (ii) to allow re-emergence of wild-type virus and thereby reduce problems of drug resistance. However, a number of clinical trials of STIs have shown adverse outcomes for patients under discontinuous therapy, including serious health risks associated with treatment interruptions. In this paper we consider in some detail two of the larger clinical studies, namely, (a) strategies for management of anti-retroviral therapy (SMART); (b) Staccato study. For each of these studies we perform computer simulations of the treatment strategies. These simulations suggest several underlying reasons for the adverse outcomes during treatment interruption. In particular, HIV infection exhibits rapid dynamic load changes, and therefore measurement based treatment regimes need to be carefully designed to avoid large transients in healthy CD4+ T cell count. Furthermore, repeated treatment interruptions may accelerate the emergence of resistant mutant virus and may increase the infection of long term reservoirs such as macrophages which will accelerate progression to AIDS."

There was a reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA of 1.43 (95% confidence interval [Cl]: -2.06, -1.22) log10 copies/ml plasma over 96 weeks, and 44% (95% CI: 31, 58) of individuals had a viral load less than 400 copies/ml. A viral load below detection at 96 weeks was predicted by a baseline genotypic sensitivity score greater than 1. There was an average increase of 67 cells/microl (95% Cl: 15, 120) from baseline CD4+ T-cell count to week 96, and the percentage of patients with CD4+ T-cell counts above 100 and 200 cells/microl increased over the trial. Injection site reactions (ISRs) were less common in people with CD4+ T-cell counts >250 cells/microl at any time during follow-up, and were more severe in patients with lower baseline peripheral fat. Adherence over 48 weeks to enfuvirtide injections ranged from 96.3-99.5%. During the 96 week trial there were two discontinuations due to ISRs and two discontinuations following hypersensitivity reactions. Over the 96 weeks of study lean body mass increased by an average 2.7 kg (95% Cl; 1.7, 3.6 kg). Mean peripheral fat increased by 0.2 kg (95% Cl; -0.2, 0.6 kg). Baseline NRTI-associated toxicities resolved in 17% of participants during follow-up. Enfuvirtide is an important component of antiretroviral therapy in highly treatment-experienced individuals where NRTI sparing may be desirable."

We analyzed selected recombinant viruses containing patient-derived HIV-1 integrase for susceptibility to a panel of strand transfer integrase inhibitors (InSTI). A pretreatment sequence analysis of the integrase coding region was performed for 112 patients identified during acute or early infection and 15 patients with triple-class resistance. A phenotypic analysis was done on 10 recombinant viruses derived from nine patients against a panel of six diverse InSTI. Few of the polymorphisms associated with in vitro InSTI resistance were identified in the samples from newly infected individuals or those patients with MDR HIV-1. We identified polymorphisms V72I, L74I, T97A, V151I, M154I/L, E157Q, V165I, V201I, I203M, T206S, and S230N. V72I was the most common, seen in 63 (56.3%) of the AHI samples. E157Q was the only naturally occurring mutation thought to contribute to resistance to elvitegravir, raltegravir, and L-870,810. None of the patient-derived viruses demonstrated any significant decrease in susceptibility to the drugs tested. In summary, the integrase coding region contains as much natural variation as that seen in protease, but mutations associated with high-level resistance to existing InSTI are rarely, if ever, present in integrase naïve patients, especially those being used clinically. Most of the highly prevalent polymorphisms have little effect on InSTI susceptibility in the absence of specific primary mutations. Baseline testing for integrase susceptibility in InSTI-naïve patients is not currently warranted."

It has been reported previously that changes in the 3-amino-acid GIV motif at positions 36 to 38 of gp41 HR1 mediate resistance to T20 but usually not to second-version fusion inhibitors, such as T1249, which target an overlapping but distinct region in HR1 including a conserved hydrophobic pocket (HP). Based on the common lack of cross-resistance and the difficulty of selecting T1249-resistant HIV-1 variants, it has been suggested that the determinants of resistance to first- and second-version fusion inhibitors may be different. To further assess HIV-1 resistance to fusion inhibitors and to analyze where changes in HR1 are tolerated, we randomized 16 codons in the HR1 region, including those making contact with HR2 codons and/or encoding residues in the GIV motif and the HP. We found that changes only at positions 37I, 38V, and 40Q near the N terminus of HR1 were tolerated. The propagation of randomly gp41-mutated HIV-1 variants in the presence of T1249 allowed the effective selection of highly resistant forms, all containing changes in the IV residues. Overall, the extent of T1249 resistance was inversely correlated to viral fitness and cytopathicity. Notably, one HIV-1 mutant showing approximately 10-fold-reduced susceptibility to T1249 inhibition replicated with wild type-like kinetics and caused substantial CD4+-T-cell depletion in ex vivo-infected human lymphoid tissue in the presence and absence of an inhibitor. Taken together, our results show that the GIV motif also plays a key role in resistance to second-version fusion inhibitors and suggest that some resistant HIV-1 variants may be pathogenic in vivo."

A mean maximum decline in RNA load occurred during the first month, followed by a resurgence between 1 and 3 months, which appeared independent of drug-resistance. Mathematical modeling suggests that this resurgence is caused by host-parasite dynamics, and thus reflects infection of the transiently increased numbers of CD4+ lymphocytes. Between 3 and 6 months of treatment, the RNA load returned to baseline values, which was associated with the emergence of virus containing a single lysine to arginine amino acid change at RT codon 70, only conferring an 8-fold reduction in susceptibility. Despite the relative loss of RNA load suppression, selection toward mutations at RT codons 215 and 41 continued. Identical patterns were observed in the mathematical model. While host-parasite dynamics and outgrowth of low-level resistant virus thus appear responsible for the loss of HIV-1 RNA load suppression, zidovudine continues to select for alternative mutations, conferring increasing levels of resistance."

One factor responsible for dissemination of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 worldwide was the intense migration of individuals, from rural to urban centers with subsequent return migration and internationally due to civil wars, tourism, business purposes, and the drug trade. In sub-Saharan Africa, between 1960 and 1980, urban centers with more than 500,000 inhabitants increased from 3 to 28, and more than 75 military coups occurred in 30 countries. The result was a massive migration of rural inhabitants to urban centers concomitant with the spread of HIV-1 to large population centers. With the associated demographic, economic, and social changes, an epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV-1 was ignited. Migratory patterns were also responsible for the spread of endemic HIV-2 to neighboring West African countries and eventually to Europe, the Americans, and India. Although Southeast Asia was the last region in which HIV-1 was introduced, it has the greatest potential for rapid spread due to population density and inherent risk behaviors. Thus, the migration of poor, rural, and young sexually active individuals to urban centers coupled with large international movements of HIV-infected individuals played a prominent role in the dissemination of HIV globally. The economic recession has aggravated the transmission of HIV by directly increasing the population at risk through increased urban migration, disruption of rural families and cultural values, poverty, and prostitution and indirectly through a decrease in health care provision. Consequently, social and economic reform as well as sexual behavior education need to be intensified if HIV transmission is to be controlled."

The changes were compared to those reported for HIV-1 subtype B, revealing striking similarities in selected phenotype and amino acids independent of differences in the RT backbone sequences that constantly distinguish the two subtypes. Particularly, identical amino acid substitutions were present simultaneously at four different positions (D67N, K70R, T215F, and K219Q) for high-level AZT resistance.

At the STD centre of the Saint-Louis hospital, Paris, we conducted a 6-week prospective study concerning the systematic detection of HIV-1 infection in 240 consecutive female out-patients in 1988, and in 504 male out-patients in 1989. The results obtained were as follow: 5/240 women (2.1 percent) and 19/504 men (3.8 percent) were seropositive for HIV-1. Out of these 24 subjects, 15 did not know they were seropositive. Predictive factors for seropositivity were male homosexuality, addiction to heroin and, in women, drug addicts as sex partners. Altogether, 23 of the 24 seropositive subjects had the classical risk factors for HIV-1 infection. None of the 744 subjects in this study were HIV-2 seropositive, and only 1 out of 504 men was HTLV-1 seropositive. We conclude that the prevalence of HIV-1 infection was high in our centre, and this prompts us to suggest that the serological test should be proposed to all out-patients and that patient's education and preventive measures should be organized by STD centres, even though the infection is still limited to patients at a particularly high risk (drug addicts, homosexuals, country of origin)."

The mechanisms driving this immune activation are poorly understood, particularly for individuals effectively treated with antiretroviral medications. We hypothesized that viral characteristics such as sequence diversity may play a role in driving HIV-associated immune activation. We therefore sequenced proviral DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-infected individuals on fully suppressive antiretroviral therapy. We performed phylogenetic analyses, calculated viral diversity and divergence in the env and pol genes, and determined coreceptor tropism and the frequency of drug resistance mutations. Comprehensive immune profiling included quantification of immune cell subsets, plasma cytokine levels, and intracellular signaling responses in T cells, B cells, and monocytes. These antiretroviral therapy-treated HIV-infected individuals exhibited a wide range of diversity and divergence in both env and pol genes. However, proviral diversity and divergence in env and pol, coreceptor tropism, and the level of drug resistance did not significantly correlate with markers of immune activation. A clinical history of virologic failure was also not significantly associated with levels of immune activation, indicating that a history of virologic failure does not inexorably lead to increased immune activation as long as suppressive antiretroviral medications are provided. Overall, this study demonstrates that latent viral diversity is unlikely to be a major driver of persistent HIV-associated immune activation."

Although the effect of interferon on the natural history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in asymptomatic persons is unknown, treatment may modify the course of the infection, producing cures in some. In September 1992, screening for HBV and HCV was offered in 40 centers throughout the United States. Demographic features, potential risk factors, and symptoms were studied. Blood samples were obtained for the determination of serum alanine aminotransferase levels and for markers of HBV and HCV infection. Thirteen thousand nine hundred ninety seven subjects were screened. The prevalence of infection with HBV or HCV was 24.8% (HBV 17.8%; HCV 7.0%; and both 2.8%). Hepatitis B and C disease was present in 0.7% and 4.4% of the population, respectively. Risk factors for HBV and HCV infection were similar in: blood transfusions, hemodialysis, IV drug use, and sex with an IV drug user. For HBV infection, sex with multiple partners, increasing age, and birth in South East Asia or Africa were additional risk factors. The cost to find a case of HCV infection is less than the costs for finding many other treatable diseases. Screening for HBV, though more costly, is reasonably efficient, and simultaneous screening for HBV and HCV provides greater efficiency. It is practical to consider screening for HBV and HCV in the United States, particularly if any risk factor is present. Improved treatment strategies will make screening even more cost effective."

According to guidelines she does not require treatment herself, but is potentially highly infectious to others. Recent legal cases in the UK show it can be criminal to pass on HIV or hepatitis B infection sexually if the risk is known and the partner has not been informed. However, there is no statute or case law showing that health workers are required to intervene to prevent such a potential 'crime', particularly when the partners are unknown, as in this case. The health workers could respond in various ways. They could do nothing, thus making further infection probable. They could advise the sex worker to use condoms and to inform her clients. They could treat the sex worker to reduce her level of infectivity, although there is no benefit to her. They could disclose the sex worker's status, although breaking confidentiality is a serious matter ethically and may be of no benefit to the unknown client group. Regulating prostitution might help; but sex workers with infection may work off licence. This paper discusses the clinical, moral and ethical issues associated with such a scenario and concludes that the most beneficial course is to target clients, through health education, to recognise the potential risks of infection from a sex worker and to take suitable precautions including immunisation against hepatitis B."

The natural history of chronic HBV infection can be divided into four dynamic phases in HBV carriers who acquire the virus early in life. Diagnosis of HBV infection is usually through serological and virological markers. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is the hallmark of HBV infection and is the first serological marker to appear in acute hepatitis B, and persistence of HBsAg for more than 6 months suggests chronic HBV infection. Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) usually indicates active HBV replication and risk of transmission of infection. Recently, occult HBV infection is recognized as the absence of circulating HBsAg in individuals positive for serum or tissue HBV DNA, irrespective of other HBV serological markers. Meanwhile, monitoring the serum HBV DNA level is valuable for assessing liver disease activity, differentiating other etiologies of hepatitis activity in HBV carriers, predicting risk of HCC development or liver-related mortality, deciding to administer antiviral therapy, determination of the response to antiviral treatment, predicting the risk of developing drug resistance, and detecting the emergence of drug-resistant mutants. On the other hand, HBV genotype C, basal core promoter mutant and pre-S deletion mutant are reported to be associated with increased risk of HCC development. The roles of quantitative HBV serology and intrahepatic HBV covalently closed circular (ccc)DNA deserve further studies. In conclusion, it is particularly important for physicians to screen for HBV infection in HBV-endemic areas and to monitor liver disease progression in HBV carriers by using both serological and virological markers, so that effective treatment can be initiated early before the development of advanced liver disease."

Comparing seven men who were probable transmitters of HIV and 11 men who had not transmitted HIV to their uninfected partners despite unprotected insertive anal intercourse, we found no differences in HIV isolation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, circulating HIV antigen detection, or presence of neutralizing antibody to HIV. Helper T-cell numbers were not significantly different between the two groups, but transmitters had more suppressor T-cells than did nontransmitters."

Hunters are designed to target exposed viral envelope proteins in the membranes of infected cells, but there is evidence that the hunter may also target envelope proteins of free HIV, inducing virus-virus fusion. In order to predict the effects of this fusion on therapy outcomes and determine whether fusion ability is advantageous for hunter virus design, we have constructed a model to account for the possibility of hunter-HIV fusion. The study was based on a target cell-limited model of HIV infection and it examined the hunter therapeutic effect on recovering the HIV main target cells, the activated CD4(+) T lymphocytes. These cells assist in setting up an immune response to opportunistic infections. The study analyzed the hunter dual mechanisms to control infection and because of diverse estimates for viral production and clearance of HIV, simulations were examined at rates spanning an order of magnitude. Results indicate that without hunter-HIV fusion ability, hunters that kill HIV-infected cells lead to a substantial recovery of healthy cell population at both low and high HIV turnover rates. When hunter-HIV fusion is included, cell recovery was particularly enhanced at lower HIV turnover rates. This study shows that the fusion ability, in addition to hunter infection ability, could be a favorable attribute for improving the efficacy of hunter-viral therapy. These results provide support for the potential use of engineered viruses to control HIV and other viral infections."

Even though there is no vaccine or effective treatment, HIV infection can be prevented through behavioral change. As the lead Public Health Service Agency for disease prevention, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has designed and implemented information and education activities with the ultimate goal of preventing HIV infection and AIDS in the United States. The target populations include the general public, school- and college-aged populations, persons infected or at increased risk of infection, minorities, and health workers. Because AIDS will be with us for a long time, CDC views educating the public as a long-term undertaking. The agency has initiated an intensive continuing national public information campaign, an informational brochure to be distributed to every U.S. household, a national AIDS information toll-free hotline, and a clearinghouse system that will maintain a comprehensive inventory of AIDS information resources and services. CDC also supports public information and education efforts by State and local health agencies. To reach school- and college-age youth, CDC, in consultation with governmental and national private sector organizations, developed guidelines for effective school health education to assist school health personnel in determining the scope and content of AIDS education. CDC also works with State and local education agencies to help carry out and evaluate educational efforts to prevent the spread of HIV among school- and college-age youth. The populations with the highest priority for AIDS information and education efforts are those who are at increased risk of acquiring or transmitting the AIDS virus because they use illicit intravenous drugs and share needles, engage in anal intercourse, have many sexual partners, practice prostitution, or engage in sex with those who practice these behaviors. Another high-priority population, because they can infect their offspring,is reproductive age women engaging in high-risk behavior and women infected with HIV who become pregnant. CDC programs targeted to these groups include community health education and risk reduction interventions, counseling and testing for HIV infection, AIDS community demonstration projects, perinatal AIDS prevention projects,and programs focused on preventing AIDS in minority populations. CDC is developing a variety of educational approaches for health workers in clinical settings because they are an important channel for providing accurate AIDS information, helping to assess risk, and counseling to actively reduce risk for the patient, sex partners of the patient, friends, and family members of the patient. CDC has conducted research and provided information and training on the use of HIV laboratory tests. CDC has also developed numerous scientific and technical guidelines and recommendations in consultation with practitioners, public health officials, and others and disseminated these through the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. In addition,CDC has provided information about the risk of HIV transmission in the workplace and about methods of prevention. CDC will continue to evaluate these activities and support research in education and related interventions that may be necessary to prevent infection by the HIV virus. By providing educational support for behavior changes that decrease HIV transmission, we can contribute to AIDS prevention in the 1990s."

In the development of HIV-1 associated neurological disorders (HAND), there may be an imbalance between complement activation and regulation, which may contribute to the neuronal damage as a consequence of HIV-1 infection. It is well recognized that opiate abuse exacerbates HIV-1 neuropathology, however, little is known about the role of complement proteins in opiate induced neuromodulation, specifically in the presence of co-morbidity such as HIV-1 infection. Complement levels are significantly increased in the HIV-1-infected brain, thus HIV-induced complement synthesis may represent an important mechanism for the pathogenesis of AIDS in the brain, but remains underexplored. Anti-HIV-1 antibodies are able to initiate complement activation in HIV-1 infected CNS cells such as microglia and astrocytes during the course of disease progression; however, this complement activation fails to clear and eradicate HIV-1 from infected cells. In addition, the antiretroviral agents used for HIV therapy cause dysregulation of lipid metabolism, endothelial, and adipocyte cell function, and activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We speculate that both HIV-1 and opiates trigger a cytokine-mediated pro-inflammatory stimulus that modulates the complement cascade to exacerbate the virus-induced neurological damage. We examined the expression levels of C1q, SC5b-9, C5L2, C5aR, C3aR, and C9 key members of the complement cascade both in vivo in post mortem brain frontal cortex tissue from patients with HAND who used/did not use heroin, and in vitro using human microglial cultures treated with HIV tat and/or heroin. We observed significant expression of C1q and SC5b-9 by immunofluorescence staining in both the brain cortical and hippocampal region in HAND patients who abused heroin. Additionally, we observed increased gene expression of C5aR, C3aR, and C9 in the brain tissue of both HIV-1 infected patients with HAND who abused and did not abuse heroin, as compared to HIV negative controls. Our results show a significant increase in the expression of complement proteins C9, C5L2, C5aR, and C3aR in HIV transfected microglia and an additional increase in the levels of these complement proteins in heroin-treated HIV transfected microglia. This study highlights the a) potential roles of complement proteins in the pathogenesis of HIV-1-related neurodegenerative disorders; b) the combined effect of an opiate, like heroin, and HIV viral protein like HIV tat on complement proteins in normal human microglial cells and HIV transfected microglial cells. In the context of HAND, targeting selective steps in the complement cascade could help ameliorating the HIV burden in the CNS, thus investigations of complement-related therapeutic approaches for the treatment of HAND are warranted."

HIV-1 and HIV-2 use the same receptor and coreceptors for entry into cells, and thus target the same cell populations in the host. Additionally, we first examined whether RNAs from HIV-1 and HIV-2 can be copackaged into the same virion. Therefore these properties suggest that in the dually infected population, it is likely that some cells can be infected by both HIV-1 and HIV-2, thereby providing opportunities for these two viruses to interact with each other. We constructed recombination assay system for measurement recombination frequencies and analyzed recombination rate between HIV-1 and HIV-2. We used modified near-full-length viruses that each contained a green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) with a different inactivating mutation. Thus, a functional gfp could be reconstituted via recombination, which was used to detect copackaging of HIV-1 and HIV-2 RNAs. In this study, approximately 0.2% of infection events generated the GFP phenotype. Therefore, the appearance of the GFP+ phenotype in the current system is approximately 35-fold lower than that between two homologous HIV-1 or HIV-2 viruses. We then mapped the general structures of the recombinant viruses and characterized the recombination junctions by DNA sequencing. We observed several different recombination patterns including those only had crossovers in gfp. The most common hybrid genomes had heterologous LTRs. Although infrequent, crossovers were also identified in the viral sequences. Such chimeric HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses have yet to be observed in the infected population. It is unclear whether the lack of observed chimeras is due to the divergence between HIV-1 and HIV-2 being too great for such an event to occur, or whether such events could occur but have not yet been observed. Given the number of coinfected people, the potential for interactions between HIV-1 and HIV-2 should not be ignored."

As a result, liver disease remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in HIV patients. Prior to 2011, treatments of HCV lacked efficacy in clinical trials in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Fortunately, several direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have now entered clinical practice and others have reached advanced stages of clinical development. These therapies offer significant benefits such as improved rates of sustained virologic response (SVR), shortened durations of treatment, and compatibility with HIV antiretroviral therapies. Treatments such as sofosbuvir (SOF) have received approval for HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Moreover, interferon-free options exist for HIV/HCV co-infected patients who may be ineligible or intolerant of interferon. Despite these improvements, physicians must be aware of the differences between these DAAs, the patient characteristics that play a role on the effectiveness of these medications, and the drug-drug interactions these DAAs may have with existing HIV antiretroviral therapies. The aim of this review is to discuss the prevalence and incidence of HIV/HCV co-infection, critical factors related to patient evaluation, current treatment options, and new developments in the management of HIV/HCV co-infected patients.

8423,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major health issue globally. Owing to the progress made in host genetics and HCV molecular virology, emerging data have suggested that the natural course and treatment response in patients with HCV infection are largely determined by complex host‑viral interactions. HCV genotype is the most important viral factor predicting the response to pegylated interferon‑α plus ribavirin therapy. The subtype of HCV genotype 1 is the key viral factor that predicts the efﬁcacy of direct‑acting antiviral therapy. HCV genome heterogeneity and baseline viral load are additionally associated with the treatment response. Multiple host genetic variants localized in genes associated with the immune response have been identified as predictors of spontaneous disease course and therapy outcome in chronic HCV. However, most findings from candidate gene association studies have not been proven universal for all investigated populations and independent studies. Previous findings in independent large genome wide association studies confirmed that interferon‑λ3 gene polymorphisms are associated with spontaneous clearance and treatment responsiveness. A polymorphism of the inosine triphosphatase gene has been identified as a protective factor against ribavirin‑induced anemia and dose reductions. Another genetic variant in the patatin‑like phospholipase domain containing 3 genes is associated with hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in patients with HCV. The present review focused on the identified viral and host factors associated with outcomes of patients with HCV, and assessed the involvement of viral and host genetics in the natural history and treatment outcomes of HCV infection. This will provide novel ideas concerning personalized prevention and individualized clinical management."

The pathogenesis and clinical outcome of HBV infection are strictly dependent on both viral factors, such as life cycle and genotypic variants, and host immune response (i.e. viral persistence). Although therapy of hepatitis B is evolving, which between single and/or combined agents are most effective, how long therapy should last, which criteria should be used to start or continue and switch or stop therapy are to be defined. Two major groups of therapies are currently utilized for chronic hepatitis: immunomodulatory (interferons) and antivirals (nucleoside and nucleotide analogues), all with their own advantages and limitations. In fact, the development of specific antiviral therapies has provoked the appearance of a relevant problem: drug resistances. The emerged antiviral drug-resistant strains of HBV leads to a poor prognosis for infected patients. Thus, many basic and clinical research challenges remain in defining optimal means of management of viral hepatitis B and its related liver diseases. This paper provides a review of new available and developing treatment options for HBV associated liver diseases. In the near future the most realistic therapeutic option for the majority of patients with HBV infection will be combination and/or long-term use of new and stronger antiviral drugs, if they maintain good safety profiles, achieve low resistance rates and will be available at lower prices."

However, isolated cases of unusual hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemias (AML), multiple myeloma (MM) or plasmacytomas, and chronic leukemias have been reported. This review focuses on these uncommon malignancies supervening in the setting of HIV infection. Eighteen cases of AML have been reported. Extramedullary localizations are frequently noticed. Nontreated patients have a survival of 2.7 weeks, compared with 9.8 months for patients treated with chemotherapy; being HIV-positive is not a contraindication to the treatment of AML. Based on the observed 72% incidence of AML M4 and M5 in an HIV-infected population versus 19% to 36% expected in a non-HIV-infected population, we postulate that the association of AML and HIV is not coincidental. The monocytotropism of HIV, the chronic cytokine-mediated activation of monocytes/macrophages, and the immunodeficiency may explain this association. Twenty-two cases of MM or plasmacytomas have been described, most of them in young patients. Again, extramedullary plasma cell tumors are recorded in many patients. Physiopathologic studies suggest that MM may develop because of an antigen-driven response to the circulating viral antigens. A role for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the pathogenesis, as previously described in high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, is suggested by the presence of EBV genomes in plasma cell tumors. Finally, a broad spectrum of chronic leukemias derived from B- or T-cell lymphocyte lineage has been reported. These associations seem coincidental."

Virion surface glycoproteins E1 and E2 play a major role in this restricted cell tropism by mediating virus entry into particular cell types. However, several pieces of evidence have suggested the ability of patient-derived HCV particles to infect peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The viral determinants and mechanisms mediating such events remain poorly understood. Here, we aimed at isolating viral determinants of HCV entry into B lymphocytes. For this purpose, we constructed a library of full E1E2 sequences isolated from serum and B lymphocytes of four chronically infected patients. We observed a strong phylogenetic compartmentalization of E1E2 sequences isolated from B lymphocytes in one patient, indicating that E1E2 glycoproteins can represent important mediators of the strong segregation of two specialized populations in some patients. Most of the E1E2 envelope glycoproteins were functional and allowed transduction of hepatocyte cell lines using HCV-derived pseudoparticles. Strikingly, introduction of envelope glycoproteins isolated from B lymphocytes into the HCV JFH-1 replicating virus switched the entry tropism of this nonlymphotropic virus from hepatotropism to lymphotropism. Significant detection of viral RNA and viral proteins within B cells was restricted to infections with JFH-1 harboring E1E2 from lymphocytes and depended on an endocytic, pH-dependent entry pathway. Here, we achieved for the first time the isolation of HCV viral proteins carrying entry-related lymphotropism determinants. The identification of genetic determinants within E1E2 represents a first step for a better understanding of the complex relationship between HCV infection, viral persistence, and extrahepatic disorders."

Morphologically, both lung lesions revealed similar polymorphic lymphoid infiltrations with numerous mitoses in case 1 and extensive necrosis and architectural distortion in case 2. Immunophenotypic examination showed no predominance of kappa or lambda light chain in case 1 and a predominance of kappa light chain in case 2. Genotypic analysis demonstrated an absence of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements in case 1 and the presence of biallelic immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement and a single clonal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in case 2. The clinical course was indolent in case 1 and aggressive in case 2. The clinicopathologic features were similar to those of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders suggesting that these lung lesions might represent an immunosuppression-related spectrum of benign to malignant diseases. EBV infection may play a role in the pathogenesis of these lesions. This study highlights the importance of the molecular characterization of AIDS-associated lymphoproliferative disorders in children in establishing a definitive diagnosis."

Combined results of in situ hybridization and Southern-blot analyses, in conjunction with immunohistochemical detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent membrane protein-I (LMP-I), showed an almost complete association of ALC Ki-I+ lymphomas and HD cases with EBV. The neoplastic cells of both these LMs also showed common immunophenotypic features such as frequent absence of B- and T-cell differentiation markers and expression of the Ki-I activation marker, while SNCC and LCI lymphomas were mainly of mature B-cell origin and Ki-I-. The concomitant high incidence of ALC Ki-I+ lymphomas and HD in a specific group of HIV+ patients, their almost complete association with EBV in clonal and episomal form and the great similarity in differentiation, activation and virological markers which they display suggest that these LMs are pathological variants of a continuous spectrum of HIV-I-associated disorders etiopathologically linked to EBV."

The objective was to determine which T cell subset of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), CD4 or CD8, were infected by HTLV-1 and the manner in which HTLV-1 proviral DNA was expressed at the level of the single cell. Both CD4-positive and CD8-positive cells of the PBMC from five patients with HAM/TSP were infected with HTLV-1. The proportion of HTLV-1-infected cells was 2.5-40% in the CD4-positive subset and 1.0-65% in the CD8- positive subset, when quantified by PCR using HTLV-1-infected MT2 cells as a positive standard. Proviral DNA of HTLV-1 was expressed in both CD4-positive cells and CD8-positive cells of the PBMC from six patients with HAM/TSP and three asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers. In patients with HAM/TSP, the proportion of the cells expressing HTLV-1 proviral DNA was 0.02-0.1% in both subsets. In asymptomatic carriers, the expression of HTLV-1 proviral DNA was 0.01-0.02% in the CD4-positive subset and 0.01% in the CD8-positive subset.

CD8+, CD57+ peripheral blood lymphocytes may be divided by the level of CD8 expression, into CD8+high (CD57+) T-cells and CD8+low (CD57+) natural killer (NK) cells. CD8+high (CD57+) T-cell numbers are increased in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-seropositive subjects, and there is substantial evidence that HCMV is integral in the development of this subset in health and disease. Furthermore, the CD8+high (CD57+) subset is clonally derived, expressing a limited range of T-cell receptors, and are therefore likely to have restricted antigen specificity. Functionally, CD8+low(CD57+) cells exhibit NK activity, while CD8+high(CD57+) T-cells from healthy subjects mediate contact-dependent suppression in several in vitro systems including: (i) pokeweed mitogen-induced proliferation and immunoglobulin synthesis, and (ii) generation of antiviral MHC-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. This is distinct from the nonspecific, soluble factor-mediated suppression exhibited from a phenotypically similar subset in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and bone marrow transplant recipients.

After a single oral dose of zidovudine, serial blood samples were analyzed for drug concentration by radioimmunoassay. A one-compartment oral absorption model was fit to the concentration-time data. The absorption rate constant (4.05 vs 2.11 hr-1) and time to maximum concentration (0.61 vs 1.03 hr) were significantly different in healthy volunteers versus patients with AIDS without hepatic disease. Differences in half-life, oral clearance, and area under the curve were not statistically significant. In the three patients with AIDS plus hepatic disease, clearance was reduced an average of 63%, and area under the curve was increased by a factor of 2.3. These comparative pharmacokinetic data do not support profound differences between zidovudine's disposition in healthy volunteers and individuals with AIDS; however, the differences and trends that were observed may represent an effect of HIV disease. Although the presence of hepatic disease clearly indicates a need to modify individual dosages, these pharmacokinetic data may have more generalized implications for zidovudine dosing as the relationships between drug concentration and therapeutic or toxic effects are clarified."

However, RBV-associated haemolytic anaemia may force dose reductions or even treatment discontinuation. The use of zidovudine might further increases the risk of anaemia in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients. The predictors of anaemia were examined in PRESCO, a large trial conducted in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients treated with pegylated interferon alpha-2a 180 mug/week plus RBV 1000-1200 mg/day. Measurements included maximal decrease in haemoglobin (Hb) throughout treatment, drops in Hb to <10 (moderate) or to <8.5 g/dL (severe), and premature RBV discontinuation because of anaemia. Finally, the impact of anaemia on sustained virological response (SVR) was assessed. Moderate or severe anaemia occurred, respectively, in 51 (13%) and 13 (3.3%) of 389 patients included in the study. Lower baseline Hb [RR: 0.14 (95% CI 0.07-0.27); P < 0.0001] and greater Hb drops during the first 4 weeks of therapy [RR: 4.74 (95% CI 2.95-7.60); P < 0.0001] were independent predictors of moderate anaemia at any time point in the multivariate analysis. Mean drops in Hb from baseline to week 4 were significantly greater in patients receiving zidovudine compared with other drugs (-3.09 vs-2.3 g/dL; P < 0.001). Lower baseline Hb [RR: 0.33 (95% CI 0.11-0.95); P = 0.04] and maximal Hb drops during treatment [RR: 2.48 (95% CI 1.33-4.59); P = 0.004] predicted treatment discontinuation because of anaemia. However, maximal Hb drops, development of moderate-severe anaemia and RBV dose reductions were comparable among patients who achieved SVR and those who did not. Lower baseline Hb predicts maximal drops in Hb and development of anaemia in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients treated with pegylated interferon plus RBV. The use of zidovudine is associated with greater Hb declines at week 4. However, severe anaemia is relatively infrequent and seems not to have much impact on SVR. Given the availability of alternative antiretroviral drugs, it is advised to avoid zidovudine while receiving anti-HCV treatment."

Second, it directly damages many tissues - gut, brain, lung - through mononuclear cell infection and activation. Third, through immune activation and effects on endothelia, it can cause more subtle systemic organ damage, such as chronic cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary and central nervous system disease. Antiretroviral treatment has enabled HIV-infected persons to live with chronic infection, although with some side-effects and mortality, including reactions due to the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). As cohorts of infected people get older, age-related diseases will combine with chronic HIV infection to produce disabilities whose scale is not yet understood. HIV is detectable in tissues by immunohistochemistry when infection loads are high, such as at first presentation. Pathologists should proactively consider HIV disease in routine diagnostic work, so as to identify more HIV-infected patients and enable their optimal management."

The HIV positivity rate increased with age after taking into account hemophilia type, clotting factor level and treatment center type. The three-year cumulative incidence of reported AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) cases based on the number of HIV positive patients, was 11.6 percent. The cumulative incidence rate was 14.6 percent (54 of 370) for those patients over 20 years of age and 4.8 percent (8 of 167) for those under 21 years of age.

This study compared policies that would either 'Discard' or 'Transplant' kidneys from Centers for Disease Control classified increased-risk donors (CDC-IRDs) using a decision analytic Markov model of renal failure treatment modalities. Base-case CDC-IRDs were current injection drug users (IDUs) with negative antibody and nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HIV and HCV, comprising 5% of kidney donors. Compared to a CDC-IRD kidney 'Discard' policy, the 'Transplant' policy resulted in higher patient survival, a greater number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (5.6 vs. 5.1 years per patient), more kidney transplants (990 vs. 740 transplants per 1000 patients) and lower cost of care ($60 000 vs. $71 000 per QALY). The total number of viral infections was lower with the 'Transplant' policy (13.1 vs. 14.8 infections per 1000 patients over 20 years), because the 'Discard' policy led to more time on hemodialysis, with a higher HCV incidence. We recommend that kidneys from NAT-negative CDC-IRDs be considered for transplantation since the practice is estimated to be beneficial from both the societal and individual patient perspective."

The evidence suggests that poor adherence to antiretroviral drug therapy is a major problem that has the potential to diminish effective viral suppression, promote viral resistance, and place patients at risk for hospitalization, opportunistic infections, and an increased risk of HIV transmission. The primary aim of this study was to understand patients' experiences regarding their adherence to antiretroviral drug therapy. Thus, 19 participants were recruited for in-depth interviews regarding their adherence to drug regimens. All the interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by using Benner's phenomenological analysis approach. Four main themes emerged from the data: (i) choosing to live and the decision to start taking medications; (ii) strategies for adhering to the regimen and managing the side-effects; (iii) relationships with healthcare providers; and (iv) advantages of the medications as a motivator to continue one's adherence to the regimen. Studying and understanding the experiences of patients can provide new insights and strategies in order to enhance patients' adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy."

Moreover, in AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma the number of these cells is also increased, in comparison with the classical type of Kaposi's sarcoma. In addition, patients suffering from HIV-1 infection may develop severe psoriasis. The aim of this study was to examine the distribution of FXIIIa+ dd in lesional and non-lesional skin from seven psoriatic patients with positive HIV-1 serology, and compare the results with age-, sex-, and site-matched HIV-1-negative psoriatic patients. In both patient groups there was an increase of FXIIIa+ dd in the papillary dermis in lesional skin, compared with non-lesional skin (HIV+ [P = 0.007]; HIV- [P = 0.0006]). Positive cells were also observed within the epidermis in lesional skin in both groups. However, there was no significant difference between HIV-1+ and HIV-1- groups in the number of FXIIIa+ dd in the epidermis and dermis (P > 0.05). These findings suggest that, if FXIIIa+ dd do have a role in psoriasis, deterioration of this condition in HIV-1+ patients is not due to proliferation of dermal dendrocytes."

Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs2302489 in CD94; rs2255336, rs2617160, rs7980470, rs 2734565, and rs17513986 in NKG2D; rs2617170, rs17549004, and rs3825295 in NKG2F; rs2734414, rs7301582, and rs2734440 in NKG2A, were selected in the present study. SNP genotyping was undertaken in 500 Han Chinese patients (285 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 215 patients who cleared HBV spontaneously) by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and by the TaqMan method. Single marker association analysis was conducted and the SNP rs2617160 with a TT genotype in NKG2D was associated significantly with an increased risk of chronic hepatitis B (P = 0.044; OR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.01-2.19).

A total of 1290 Chinese Han individuals were enrolled, including 63 asymptomatic HBV carriers, 220 chronic hepatitis B patients (CHB), 249 HBV-related liver cirrhosis patients (LC), 108 patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 338 patients with natural HBV clearance and 312 healthy subjects (as controls). DNA samples from these subjects were genotyped for four ICOS SNPs (rs11883722, rs10932029, rs1559931 and rs4675379) using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay and analysed. The data showed that genotype and allele frequencies of ICOS SNPs in cases and controls followed the Hardy-Weinberg distribution. The CC genotype of rs4675379 was higher in patients with HBV infection (including AC, CHB, LC and HCC) than in patients with HBV clearance (P = 0.006). Furthermore, the genotype 'GA' and the minor allele 'A' of rs1559931 were associated with a decreased HCC susceptibility (P < 0.001). Haplotype analysis data showed that 'GC' haplotype in block 2 (rs1559931 and rs4675379) had a lower frequency in patients than in HBV-cleared subjects (P = 0.034), although its overall frequency was only 1.6%.

9881,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Host genetic factors and environment factors including hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes are widely studied for the different outcomes of HBV infection. Recent studies suggest that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a pivotal role in the viral clearance and host immune response to HBV, and the capacity for TNF-alpha production in individuals is influenced by a major genetic component. In this study, we aimed to explore whether the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TNF-alpha promoter are associated with the outcomes of HBV infection in the Chinese Han population. One hundred and forty-three spontaneously recovered HBV subjects and 196 chronic hepatitis B patients were recruited in this case-control study in the Beijing area of China. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and sequence-specific primer-PCR (SSP-PCR) were used to detect the SNPs of five sites in the TNF-alpha promoter (-238G/A, -308G/A, -857C/T, -863C/A, -1031T/C). The frequency distributions of genotypes and haplotypes in two groups were analysed by EPI and EH programs. The presence of the -238GG genotype was significantly correlated with persistence of HBV infection (OR = 4.08, P = 0.02), and -857TT genotype appeared in relation to the spontaneous clearance of HBV (OR = 0.47, P = 0.03). Frequency of haplotype GGCCT (-238/-308/-857/-863/-1031) in the chronic HB group was significantly lower than that in spontaneously recovered group (P = 0.03), and frequencies of haplotypes GGCAT and GGTAT in the chronic HB group were significantly higher than those in the spontaneously recovered group (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0004).

However, it is not known whether these polymorphisms are associated with the risk of developing chronic HBV infection in other racial or ethnic populations. Accordingly, we conducted a candidate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association study in Tibetan and Uygur HBV-infected patients. A total of 1302 subjects including 871 Tibetans and 431 Uygurs were recruited. According to their serological and clinical characteristics, each ethnic group was divided into two groups comprising spontaneous clearance individuals and persistently infected patients. Three SNPs were genotyped by a high resolution melting curve methodology. Among the SNPs, rs2296651 exhibited a minor allele frequency of <0.01. The frequency of allele A at rs4646287 was much higher in Tibetans (9.4% for Tibetans and 4.6% for Uygurs, p<0.001) than in Uygurs, but the frequency of allele A at rs7154439 was the opposite (15.7% for Tibetans and 20.5% for Uygurs, p=0.002). Irrespective of race, no significant differences in the frequency distributions of the three SNP alleles or genotypes were observed between the case and clearance groups. Moreover, none of the NTCP haplotypes were statistically different between the two groups. Data from the Tibetan patients could be grouped by HBeAg status, viral load and HBV genotype; however, no significant differences were found in the SNP genotype distribution for each characteristic. In conclusion, the NTCP polymorphisms we identified tended to be ethnicity-dependent. For Tibetans and Uygurs, no association of the three SNPs (rs7154439, rs4646287 and rs2296651) and their haplotypes with HBV chronicity was observed.

A multicenter study including HIV-infected patients who underwent KT in Spain, from 2001 to 2011, was performed. The study population included 108 recipients, 36 HIV-infected, and 72 matched HIV-negative KT recipients. HIV-infected recipients developed more delayed graft function (DGF) (52% vs. 21%, P < 0.001). One- and 3-year graft survival was 91.6% and 86.2% in HIV-infected patients, and 97.1% and 94.7% in HIV-negative patients (P = 0.052). In two-variate Cox analysis, HIV infection was not a predictor of graft loss after adjusting for time on dialysis, acute rejection, and DGF. Multivariate analysis for DGF revealed HIV-positive status as independent risk factor. We analyzed the evolution of immunosuppressive and antiretroviral therapy (ART). In HIV-infected patients tacrolimus trough levels were very high in the first week and significantly lower in the second week post-transplant (P = 0.042). Post-transplant ART was significantly changed: protease inhibitors use decreased (P = 0.034) and integrase inhibitor use increased (P < 0.001). DGF is another frequent early complication in HIV-infected recipients that can affect graft survival.

Among 848 women contributing 6,721 years of follow-up, 194 participants died during follow-up, resulting in a crude mortality rate of 2.9 per 100 women-years. Cumulative mortality curves indicated greatest mortality for women who reported depressive symptoms and had not initiated ART. The hazard ratio for depressive symptoms was 3.38 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.15, 5.33) and for ART was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.70). Using a reference category of women without depressive symptoms who had initiated ART, the hazard ratio for women with depressive symptoms who had initiated ART was 3.60 (95% CI: 2.02, 6.43).

Four patients (5%) had multiple risk factors; risk factors were denied by seven patients (8%). The mean age at surgery was 41.6 years (range, 22 to 67 years). Surgical conditions that rarely affect the population without the human immunodeficiency virus presented diagnostic challenges. Altered physiologic responses to even routine conditions were observed. Thirty-day morbidity rates for emergency (group A) and elective (group B) procedures were 19% and 9%, respectively. This included seven surgical deaths (13%) in group A and one in group B (2%). Patients undergoing 92 of 112 procedures (82%) not associated with surgical mortality were followed up. Patients who were dead at follow-up had mean procedure-survivals of 19 weeks (group A) and 21 weeks (group B) for 33 procedures. Those who remained alive had a mean procedure-survival of 86 weeks for 59 procedures. No single prognosticator could be correlated with outcome, although the combination of hypoalbuminemia with a history of opportunistic infection(s) was associated with short survival.

From 2007 to 2010, 298 men underwent RALP, 8 of whom were known to be HIV positive. Preoperatively, all eight were taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and had undetectable viral loads (<50); mean CD4 count was 634 cells per mm(3). HIV-positive men were younger (54 versus 62 years, P=0.010) and less likely to be white (P=0.007). There were no significant differences between groups with respect to clinical staging, pathological and oncological outcomes or most complication rates. However, the prevalence of perioperative transfusions (P=0.031) and ileus (P=0.021) were higher in HIV-positive patients. HIV remained significantly associated with risk of transfusion after adjustment for age, race, Gleason sum and clinical T stage (P=0.002). After a median of 2.6 (range 0.03-19.2) months of follow-up, PSA remained undetectable in all eight HIV patients.

Intervention at the earliest possible stage is needed to prevent such untoward sequelae. Currently, interferon (IFN) is the only approved and widely used agent for the treatment of these infections, including in HBV patients with precore mutant hepatitis or decompensated cirrhosis, but its efficacy is far from satisfactory. Corticosteroid priming has been shown to increase the efficacy of IFN therapy in HBV patients with low abnormal serum transaminase levels, but only a few responders will clear serum hepatitis Bs antigen (HBsAg). Ongoing randomized controlled trials of thymosin alpha 1, lamivudine and famcyclovir have demonstrated encouraging preliminary results. Therapeutic vaccines, such as polypeptides with human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-specific hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) epitopes, are under phase II/III clinical trial. For HDV infection, the use of IFN in the early phase of acute superinfection tends to prevent chronic progression. For HCV infection, IFN used at higher doses for a longer period of time is associated with a higher sustained response, but overall it is still not satisfactory. The combined use of ribavirin or corticosteroid priming may improve the effect of IFN therapy by enhancing the durability of the response. Interferon in the acute phase of HCV infection may also prevent chronic progression. There is evidence to suggest that IFN therapy, when associated with response, tends to reduce the risk of cirrhosis or HCC and prolongs survival. There is no doubt that satisfactory treatment of chronic viral infection will require more effective agents and demand optimal treatment strategies, many of which are yet to be found."

Coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a particular area of concern, as the global prevalence has been estimated at 2.5-5 million people. In this article, we discuss the epidemiology of HCV infection and reinfection, HCV-related liver disease progression in the era of effective ART, and the efficacy of emerging HCV treatment strategies in persons with HIV/HCV coinfection. New data regarding treatment of persons with HIV/HCV coinfection suggest that HCV treatment should be a priority in those with HIV. Results from recent studies using all-oral HCV regimens have shown high rates of sustained virologic response in both clinical trials and real-world settings. A multidisciplinary approach to HCV treatment in those with HIV is recommended for optimal patient management. Following HCV cure, practitioners also need to be mindful of the risks for HCV reinfection and educate patients on protective measures."

Neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines expressing the dopamine transporter, as well as primary macrophages exposed to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), were used to investigate the possibility of any synergistic effect between the mode of toxicity of such substances and virus exposure. The drugs of abuse used in our experiments were cocaine and morphine, which exert their action, among others, on the dopaminergic system. Effects were compared to treatment with dopamine itself and a typical dopaminergic drug used pharmaceutically, selegiline. In macrophage cultures, glutathione (GSH) was upregulated strongly after treatment with dopamine, morphine or selegiline, and this effect was enhanced when cells were pre-exposed to virus. This upregulation is discussed as a compensatory reaction to an oxidative signal. When hydrogen peroxide plus iron sulfate was used as a strong oxidant in macrophages, GSH concentrations decreased as a result of cell injury. Cell numbers remained constant in all treatment groups. In contrast, in both neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines, the modulation of GSH concentrations by neurotropic substances was accompanied by significant cell loss, which was exacerbated by HIV-1 pretreatment. Selegiline did not change cell numbers when incubated alone. However, when incubated following treatment with HIV-1 cell death was highly significant. Ascorbic acid (AA), included as antioxidant, totally restored cell loss in cultures treated with dopamine. However, no effect was observed in combined treatment of AA and morphine or selegiline. The results demonstrate a synergistic role in cellular toxicity due to neurotropic substances and HIV-1, and suggest that neuropharmacological agents may contribute to the pathogenesis of ADC."

Transgender women living with HIV (TWLWH) in the US report suboptimal adherence to medications and are found to have difficulty integrating HIV medication into their daily routine, but few studies explore the factors associated with medication adherence among transgender women. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine demographic and clinical factors related to self-reported medication adherence among transgender women. This secondary analysis is based on data collected from the Symptom and Genetic Study that included a convenience sample of 22 self-identified transgender women, 201 non-transgender men, and 72 non-transgender women recruited in northern California. Self-reported medication adherence was assessed using the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Adherence Questionnaire. Gender differences in demographic and clinical variables were assessed, as were differences between transgender women reporting high and low adherence. Transgender women had lower adherence to medications compared to non-transgender males and non-transgender females (p = .028) and were less likely to achieve viral suppression (p = .039). Within the transgender group, Black/African-Americans reported better adherence than participants who were Whites/Caucasian or other races (p = .009). Adherence among transgender women was unrelated to medication count and estrogen therapy, but consistent with other reports on the HIV population as a whole; transgender women with high adherence were more likely to achieve viral suppression compared to the transgender women with low adherence. Despite the high incidence of HIV infection in the transgender population, few studies focus on TWLWH, either in regard to their adherence to antiretroviral therapies or to their healthcare in general. To address ongoing health disparities, more studies are needed focusing on the transgender population's continuum of care in HIV therapies."

Among patients with a CD4 cell count <350 cells/mm(3), receipt of HAART was associated with a significantly decreased incidence of comorbidities not related to HIV infection or AIDS."

For this study, all adult PWA (877) admitted for the first time to the HHC program, established for PWAs in the metropolitan area of Rome, between January 1994 and December 1998, were enrolled. Temporal changes in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated. For subjects who concluded their first HHC cycle (851/877), the reasons for ending the service were assessed over time. From 1994 to 1998, the proportion of patients admitted to HHC of those living with AIDS in the Rome area decreased significantly (from 15.1% to 7.5%), while the median CD4+ cell count at HHC entry increased significantly. The proportion of patients referred to outpatient services at the end of their cycle of HHC increased sevenfold from 1994 to 1998, with a steep increase between 1996 and 1997. In multivariate analysis, only the use of triple-combination ART was significantly associated with referral to outpatient care (odds ratio [OR] = 4.26; 95%, confidence interval [CI] = 1.94-9.34). The results suggest that HHC use by PWAs in the ART era has diminished, while the HHC use pattern has also changed: there is a growing tendency to provide care to patients with less advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, prior to the beneficial effects of drugs, and the consequent referral to outpatient care."

In the first cohort of 434 subjects, 223 (51%) individuals demonstrated a positive HSV-2 serological status while 66 (66%) of 100 subjects in the second cohort were seropositive for HSV-2 (51 versus 66%; P = 0.08). Among the 223 HSV-2-seropositive subjects identified in the first study cohort, only 22 (10%) had suffered from recurrent anogenital lesions during the past 12 months while 154 (69%) had no clinical history of herpesvirus infection. Our findings demonstrate high proportions of subclinical and undiagnosed HSV-2 infection in HIV-1-infected individuals and suggest that HSV type-specific serological testing in the French HIV-1-infected subpopulation could be an efficient strategy to diagnose clinically asymptomatic HSV-2 infections."

We explored pre-ART LTFU in Zambézia province utilizing quantitative and qualitative methods. Patients were deemed LTFU if they were more than 60 days late for either a scheduled appointment or a CD4+ cell count blood draw, according to national guidelines. Among 13,968 adult patients registered for care, 211 (1.8 %) died, one transferred, 2,196 (15.7 %) initiated ART, and 9,195 (65.8 %) were LTFU during the first year. Being male, younger, less educated, and/or having no home electricity were associated with LTFU. Qualitative interviews revealed that poor clinical care, logistics and competing priorities contribute to attrition. In addition, many expressed fears of stigma and/or rejection by family or community members because they were HIV-infected. At 66 %, pre-ART LTFU in Zambézia, Mozambique is a significant problem. This study highlights characteristics of lost patients and discusses barriers requiring consideration to improve retention. "

The morbidity and mortality associated with CNS cryptococcal infection can be significantly reduced by early recognition of the imaging appearances by the radiologist in order to focus and expedite clinical management and treatment. The emergence and evolution of anti-retroviral therapy have also impacted significantly on the imaging appearances, morbidity, and mortality of this neuro-infection. The constellation of varied imaging appearances associated with cryptococcal CNS infection in the HIV and AIDS population in the era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) will be presented in this review.

Of 15 known human cyclophilins, cyclophilin A (CypA) has been the focus of investigation because it was detected in HIV-1 virions. To determine whether CypA promotes HIV-1 replication, we deleted the gene encoding CypA (PPIA) in human CD4(+) T cells by homologous recombination. HIV-1 replication in PPIA(-/-) cells was decreased and not inhibited further by cyclosporin or gag mutations that disrupt Gag's interaction with cyclophilins, indicating that no other cyclophilin family members promote HIV-1 replication. The defective replication phenotype was specific for wild-type HIV-1 since HIV-2/SIV isolates, as well as HIV-1 bearing a gag mutation that confers cyclosporin resistance, replicated the same in PPIA(+/+) and PPIA(-/-) cells. Stable re-expression of CypA in PPIA(-/-) cells restored HIV-1 replication to an extent that correlated with steady-state levels of CypA. Finally, virions from PPIA(-/-) cells possessed no obvious biochemical abnormalities but were less infectious than virions from wild-type cells. These data formally demonstrate that CypA regulates the infectivity of HIV-1 virions."

Maintaining medication adherence is vital to ensuring that adolescents living with HIV/AIDS receive the benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART), although this group faces unique challenges to adherence. Knowledge of the factors influencing adherence among people during this unique developmental period is needed to develop more targeted and effective adherence-promoting strategies. This systematic review summarizes the literature on quantitative observational studies examining correlates, including risk and resilience-promoting factors, of ART adherence among adolescents living with HIV/AIDS in LMICs. A systematic search of major electronic databases, conference-specific databases, gray literature, and reference lists of relevant reviews and documents was conducted in May 2014. Included studies examined relationships between at least one factor and ART adherence as an outcome and were conducted in primarily an adolescent population (age 10-19) in LMICs. The search identified 7948 unique citations from which 15 studies fit the inclusion criteria. These 15 studies identified 35 factors significantly associated with ART adherence representing a total of 4363 participants across nine different LMICs. Relevant studies revealed few consistent relationships between measured factors and adherence while highlighting potentially important themes for ART adherence including the impact of (1) adolescent factors such as gender and knowledge of serostatus, (2) family structure, (3) the burdensome ART regimens, route of administration, and attitudes about medication, and (4) health care and environmental factors, such as rural versus urban location and missed clinic appointments. Rates of adherence across studies ranged from 16% to 99%. This review identifies unique factors significantly related to ART adherence among adolescents living in LMICs. More research using longitudinal designs and rigorous measures of adherence is required in order to identify the range of factors influencing ART adherence as adolescents living with HIV/AIDS in LMICs grow into adulthood."

407,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"HIV/AIDS in Latin America is concentrated among men who have sex with men (MSM). However, accurate estimates of engagement in HIV care in this population can be difficult to ascertain because many do not self-identify as MSM. Given evidence of decreased HIV transmissibility in the context of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, identifying individuals not in care who are engaging in HIV transmission risk behavior is crucial for secondary prevention. Primary aims of this study were to examine engagement in care from testing to ART adherence among MSM using online social/sexual networking across Latin America, and whether individuals not in care at each step reported greater sexual transmission risk behavior than those in care. In the overall sample (n=28,779), approximately 75% reported ever being tested for HIV, and 9% reported having received an HIV diagnosis. Among known HIV-infected individuals, 20% reported not being in care, 30% reported not taking ART, and 55% reported less than 100% ART adherence. Over one-third of HIV-infected individuals reported sexual HIV transmission risk behavior, defined as unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) with a male partner of different/unknown HIV serostatus in the past three months. HIV-infected individuals not engaged in care more often reported UAI compared to those in care (OR=1.29; 95% CI=1.01-1.66). Although not statistically significant, HIV-infected individuals not on ART more often reported UAI compared to those on ART (OR=1.18; 95% CI=0.94-1.47). Individuals who reported less than 100% ART adherence more often reported UAI compared to individuals with 100% adherence (OR=1.55; 95% CI=1.26-1.90). Findings demonstrate that a substantial portion of HIV-infected MSM in Latin America who are likely not virologically suppressed from lack of ART use or adherence report sexual HIV transmission risk. Tailoring secondary HIV prevention for MSM in Latin America who are not in HIV care or adherent to ART may be warranted."

Univariate analysis and logistic regression were used to study the determinants of HIV and HBV and/or HCV co-infection. The overall prevalence was 41·83% (95% CI 40·36-43·30) for anti-HCV and 12·49% (95% CI 11·50-13·48) for HBsAg, respectively. The prevalence of anti-HCV and HBsAg varied according to the route of HIV transmission. Compared to those with sexually acquired HIV infection, intravenous drug users and blood donors/recipients had the greatest risk of carrying anti-HCV. Needle sharing and unprotected sexual exposures are important modes of transmission for HBV. Further interventions including health education and harm reduction strategies should be implemented in high-risk populations."

This study analyzed data from a prevention-with-positives program to understand if socio-economic, behavioral, and health-related factors are associated with antiretroviral failure and HIV transmission-risk behaviors among 113 HIV-positive biological and transgender women. An affirmative answer to a simple screening question for recent trauma was significantly associated with both outcomes. Compared to participants without recent trauma, participants reporting recent trauma had over four-times the odds of antiretroviral failure (AOR 4.3; 95% CI 1.1-16.6; p = 0.04), and over three-times the odds of reporting sex with an HIV-negative or unknown serostatus partner (AOR 3.9; 95% CI 1.3-11.9; p = 0.02) and <100% condom use with these partners (AOR 4.5; 95% CI 1.5-13.3; p = 0.007).

ANRS 130 Apollo is a randomized study, conducted in naive HIV-1-infected patients, either asymptomatic with CD4 counts of <100/mm(3) or stage B/C disease with CD4 counts of <200/mm(3). Patients received tenofovir-emtricitabine with lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r) or efavirenz and were randomized to receive ENF for 24 weeks (ENF arm) or not (control arm). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with CD4 counts of ≥ 200/mm(3) at week 24. A total of 195 patients were randomized: 73% had stage C disease, 78% were male, the mean age was 44 years, the median CD4 count was 30/mm(3), and the median HIV-1 RNA load was 5.4 log(10) copies/ml. Eighty-one percent of patients received LPV/r. One patient was lost to follow-up, and eight discontinued the study (four in each arm). The proportions of patients with CD4 counts of ≥ 200/mm(3) at week 24 were 34% and 38% in the ENF and control arms, respectively (P = 0.53). The proportions of patients with HIV-1 RNA loads of <50 copies/ml were 74% and 58% at week 24 in the ENF and control arms, respectively (P < 0.02), and the proportion reached 79% in both arms at week 48. Twenty (20%) and 12 patients (13%) in the ENF and control arms, respectively, experienced at least one AIDS event during follow-up (P = 0.17). Although inducing a more rapid virological response, addition of ENF to a standard cART does not improve the immunological outcome in naive HIV-infected patients with severe immunosuppression."

The impacts of two enhanced (four- and five-drug) highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) on early viral decay and rebound were determined. The four-drug combination consisted of an integrase inhibitor, L-870-812 (L-812), together with a three-drug regimen comprising emtricitabine [(-)-FTC], tenofovir (TFV), and efavirenz (EFV). The five-drug combination consisted of one analog for each of the four DNA precursors {using TFV, (-)-FTC, (-)-β-D-(2R,4R)-1,3-dioxolane-2,6-diaminopurine (amdoxovir [DAPD]), and zidovudine (AZT)}, together with EFV. A cohort treated with a three-drug combination of (-)-FTC, TFV, and EFV served as treated controls. Daily administration of a three-, four-, or five-drug combination of antiretroviral agents was initiated at week 6 or 8 after inoculation and continued up to week 50, followed by a rebound period. Plasma samples were collected routinely, and drug levels were monitored using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Viral loads were monitored with a standard TaqMan quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. Comprehensive analyses of replication dynamics were performed. RT-SHIV infection in rhesus macaques produced typical viral infection kinetics, with untreated controls establishing persistent viral loads of >10(4) copies of RNA/ml. RT-SHIV loads at the start of treatment (V0) were similar in all treated cohorts (P > 0.5). All antiretroviral drug levels were measureable in plasma. The four-drug and five-drug combination regimens (enhanced HAART) improved suppression of the viral load (within 1 week; P < 0.01) and had overall greater potency (P < 0.02) than the three-drug regimen (HAART). Moreover, rebound viremia occurred rapidly following cessation of any treatment. The enhanced HAART (four- or five-drug combination) showed significant improvement in viral suppression compared to the three-drug combination, but no combination was sufficient to eliminate viral reservoirs."

Necroinflammation and fibrosis was scored by the Ishak classification system, and binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess HIV and antiretroviral-related determinants of necroinflammation and fibrosis. A total of 46 biopsies were included; 33 were from HIV-positive patients co-infected with HCV and 15 biopsies were from HIV-positive patients co-infected with HBV. One HIV-positive patient was co-infected with HBV and HCV. Median biopsy inflammatory grade for the cohort was 8.5 (IQR 6-10), the median fibrosis Stage 2 (IQR 1.8-4), and the median steatosis score was 1 (IQR 0-2). At the univariate level, HIV-related variables that were significantly associated with more severe biopsy changes were higher HIV RNA at the time of biopsy (associated with inflammatory Grade 10+; P = 0.018) and any exposure to didanasine (ddI) or stavudine (D4T; associated with fibrosis Stage 3+; P = 0.022). HIV RNA at the time of biopsy remained significant at the multivariate level. Patients with HIV hepatitis co-infection in this cohort had surprisingly mild changes in liver histology, and there were no statistically significant differences between biopsy results in HBV compared to HCV co-infection. The association between HIV RNA and necroinflammation supports current recommendations for earlier initiation of HAART in patients with HIV-hepatitis co-infection."

Fibrates are indicated when hypertriglyceridemia is accentuated and persists for over six months. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of bezafibrate for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in HIV-infected individuals on HAART. All patients received 400mg/day of bezafibrate and were evaluated three times: Mo (pre-treatment), M1 (one month after treatment), and M2 (six months after treatment). Fifteen adult individuals, eight males and seven females with mean age = 41.2 +/- 7.97 years and triglyceride serum levels > 400mg/dL were included in the study. Smoking, alcohol ingestion and sedentarism rates were 50%, 6.66% and 60%, respectively. Family history of CD, hypertension and diabetes mellitus was reported in 33.3%, 40% and 46.7% of the cases, respectively, while dyslipidemia was reported by only 13.3%. More than half of the patients were using a protease inhibitor plus a nucleotide analog transcriptase inhibitor. Eutrophy and tendency toward overweight were observed at all three study time points. There were significant reductions in triglyceride serum levels from Mo to M1 and from Mo to M2. No significant changes were observed in the serum levels of creatine phosphokinase, hepatic enzymes, CD4+, CD8+ and viral load.

One hundred and twenty-three women who did not use IV drugs but had had sex with an IVDU in the last 6 months were interviewed. Eighty percent belonged to an ethnic minority, and 20% were white. Condom use was infrequent regardless of the number of sexual contacts. Sex was primarily heterosexual, with unsafe vaginal intercourse being the most common practice. Barriers to condom use were self-related and partner related. Some women lacked knowledge about sexual transmission of AIDS.

At entry, 10% of 201 sexual partners were anti-HIV-1-positive. Follow-up of 151 uninfected partners during a total of 351 person-years of observation showed no sero-conversions, although there were 13 pregnancies during that period. Eighty-seven percent of the seronegative respondents to a detailed questionnaire reported unprotected sexual contact at least occasionally. Among 304 other household members, including 108 parents who helped administer clotting factor concentrates to their children, none was seropositive at entry. Follow-up of 263 showed no seroconversions during a total of 605 person-years of observation. Thus, anti-HIV-1-positive hemophiliacs transmitted to their partners earlier in their course but were not found to do so when prospectively observed. No relationship to level of viremia as indicated by CD4 count, HIV-1 p24 antigenemia, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was found.

Vertical transmission and sexual intercourse are the major routes of transmission. Women are at greater risk of contracting the virus as it is more efficiently transmitted from male to female than in the reverse. Prevention of transmission is best achieved by health education on safe practices. The study aims to document the knowledge, attitude and behaviour pattern (KABP) of a group of women five years after they had participated in a mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-1 risk reduction study. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a 46-point structured interviewer-administered questionnaire to capture data from 88 mothers. Overall knowledge scores were computed and four rating categories created. There were large deficiencies in the knowledge and practice of women at risk of being infected with HTLV-1. Only 58% knew that HTLV-1 is sexually transmitted. A minority was aware of HTLV-1 associated diseases: Adult T-cell lymphoma/leukaemia (ATL) -30.7%; Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (TSP) -42%; Infective dermatitis -42%). Ten (11.4%) believed that HTLV-1 infection can cause HIV/AIDS and only 33% knew that there was no cure for the virus. Most women (88.6%) continued to have unprotected sex. Controlling HTLV-1 spread must be based on interrupting transmission. In Jamaica, donated blood is screened for HTLV-1 and sharing of infected needle is an insignificant mode of transmission. However although safe practices in breastfeeding and sexual intercourse are proven ways to reduce HTLV-1 transmission, these data show that knowledge and safe practices among those at risk may not be retained and health education will need to be sustained."

In China, HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) is surging, yet many HIV-positive MSM do not use HIV care services. We conducted a qualitative study in order to help positive interventions to promote linkage-to-care in this key population. Four focus group discussions (FGD) were held among HIV-positive MSM in Beijing, China, to ascertain knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and practices related to HIV care. FGD participates highlighted six major barriers of linkage to/engagement in HIV care: (1) perceived discrimination from health care workers; (2) lack of guidance and follow-up; (3) clinic time or location inconvenience; (4) privacy disclosure concerns; (5) psychological burden of committing to HIV care; and (6) concerns about treatment. Five major sub-themes emerged from discussions on the facilitators of linkage to/engagement in care: (1) peer referral and accompaniment; (2) free HIV care; (3) advocacy from HIV-positive MSM counselors; (4) extended involvement for linking MSM to care; and (5) standardization of HIV care (i.e., reliable high quality care regardless of venue). An understanding of the barriers and facilitators that may impact the access to HIV care is essential for improving the continuum of care for MSM in China. Findings from our study provide research and policy guidance for how current HIV prevention and care interventions can be enhanced to link and engage HIV-positive MSM in HIV care. "

Adjusting for sociodemographics, four logistic regression models were constructed to assess the association of risk behaviors with HIV seropositivity. In model 1, the variables found to be significantly associated with HIV seropositivity were injecting four times a day, injection as the only route of consuming drugs, and years of injection. In model 2, the only risk behavior significantly associated with HIV seropositivity was injecting drugs in shooting galleries. In model 3, all sex risk variables failed to meet the adjusted level of significance. In model 4, pneumonia, hepatitis, and syphilis were significantly linked with HIV infection. In order to assess the individual effects of the significant variables in each one of the four models, a logistic regression analysis was performed simultaneously controlling for all of the variables. After adjustment for the Bonferroni correction, age group 25-34 years, injection as the only route of using drugs, number of years of injection, and syphilis were the only significant variables remaining."

However, IDUs may be heterogeneous with regard to risk behaviors, and a subpopulation may be responsible for the majority of blood-borne pathogen transmission. We studied 926 adult injection drug users (IDU) from the cities of Tbilisi, Batumi, and Poti in Georgia, a small country in the Caucuses region between the Black and Caspian Seas, between 1997 and 1998. Study participants were administered a confidential questionnaire and were tested for antibody to HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc). Five (0.5%) individuals were positive for HIV; 539 (58.2%), for HCV; 67 (7.2%), for HBsAg; and 475, for (51.3%) anti-HBc. Surveyed individuals, 88.7%, reported sharing needles with others, and needle sharing with more than 10 other individuals versus no sharing was a highly significant predictor (OR: 278.12, 95% CI: 77.57, 997.20) of HCV seropositivity. In adjusted analysis, individuals who usually injected stolen medical/synthetic drugs had significantly lower odds of HCV (OR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.68) and HBV (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.37, 0.90) than individuals most commonly injecting opium. Despite some limitations, these results suggest the presence of substantial heterogeneity between different injection drug-using groups in Georgia. Identification of high-risk IDU subpopulations is vital to efficiently target risk reduction programs and to prevent confounding by risk status in large HIV/AIDS behavioral intervention and vaccine trials."

Participants underwent semiannual interviews, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV antibody testing, and pretest and posttest counseling. We used chi(2) statistics to study changes in the frequencies of high-risk behaviors from baseline to a 6-month follow-up visit among 46 IDUs who had a positive HCV test result and among 60 IDUs who did not have a positive HCV test result or who were unaware of their test result. No significant differences were detected between the 2 groups. Both groups continued to share syringes, needles, and other injection paraphernalia. These findings suggest that young IDUs may not be aware of the risk of HCV infection and highlight the urgent need for post-HCV test guidelines and behavioral interventions to reduce ongoing high-risk behavior that perpetuates the risk of HCV transmission."

This cross-sectional observational study from the University of Washington HIV cohort examined associations between HCV, symptoms, and depression in HIV-infected patients in routine clinical care. Patients completed instruments measuring depression, symptoms, and substance use. We generated depression severity scores and used linear regression to examine the relationship with HCV accounting for demographic and clinical characteristics. We conducted sensitivity analyses in which we removed depression somatic symptom items (e.g., fatigue) from depression scores, and sensitivity analyses in which we also adjusted for nondepression somatic symptom items to examine the role of somatic and nonsomatic symptoms in the association between depression and HCV. Of 764 HIV-infected patients, 160 (21%) were HCV-infected. In adjusted analysis, HCV-infected patients had worse depression severity (p =0.01) even after adjusting for differences in substance use. HCV remained associated with depression severity in secondary analyses that omitted the depression somatic patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) items (p=0.01). However, when nondepression somatic symptoms were included as covariates in multivariate analyses, HCV was no longer associated with depression (p=0.09)."

Little is known as to what extent drug resistance occurs in vivo and whether its development within the CNS differs from that in peripheral blood. We therefore performed comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) gene in proviral DNA obtained from blood and CSF of three patients, all of whom had progressed to AIDS under long-term zidovudine treatment. Six to 11 individual proviral copies per patient and compartment were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated direct sequencing. In all samples, mutations associated with zidovudine resistance could be identified. They occurred in multiple HIV-1 copies in both blood and CSF, indicating that molecular determinants of resistance are reflected in most individual proviruses in vivo. Comparable positions and frequencies of mutations in isolates derived from both compartments do not argue for independent development of zidovudine resistance in CSF."

To examine this hypothesis, we determined the CCR5-Delta32 allele frequency by polymerase chain reaction in a Belgian cohort of 163 HCV-infected patients and 310 healthy control subjects. The resulting CCR5-Delta32 allele frequencies were 0.080 and 0.119 for the patient group and control group, respectively. In contrast with a previous study, we could not show a statistically significant difference between the CCR5-Delta32 allele frequencies in HCV patients and controls. Moreover, genotype distributions in both populations were in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Our results do not support the hypothesis that the CCR5-Delta32 mutant allele is a risk factor for hepatitis C virus infection."

Relatively short sequences (such as the 222 bp fragment of NS-5) provided effective discrimination of types, subtypes and isolates, and produced equivalent relationships between genotypes as were found upon comparison of longer sequences of NS-5, of the core region, and by comparison of the limited number of complete genomic sequences currently available. Measurement of evolutionary distances in the core and NS-5 regions allowed 79 of the 104 samples to be identified as examples of known genotypes, while 17 of the remainder could be provisionally classified as new subtypes of types 1 (Nigeria), 2 (Gambia), 3 (India, Pakistan and Bangladesh) and 4 (Middle East) on the basis of sequence comparison in core and NS-5 (n = 9) or provisionally using core alone (n = 8). The remaining sequences from Thailand made up two groups showing no close similarity to any of the six major genotypes classified to date, although one corresponded to an as yet unclassified variant of HCV also found in Thailand. However, phylogenetic analysis of the core and NS-5 regions indicated a distant relationship between these sequences with variants found in Vietnam and with type 6a, and collectively they formed a diverse single phylogenetic group. The existence of great diversity within a single genotype was also found amongst type 3 sequences in the Indian subcontinent, amongst type 4 variants in Central Africa and the Middle East, and amongst type variants in Nigeria. These findings may provide clues for understanding the origins and mechanisms of transmission of HCV."

Interviews were conducted with people in rural areas and small cities in Delaware, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina who were at least 18 years old and infected with HIV in order to describe demographic characteristics, migration patterns and risk behaviors. Interviews were conducted with 608 people. Most respondents were male (66 percent), black (63 percent of men, 85 percent of women) and had been infected through sexual contact (67 percent of men, 66 percent of women). Most (65 percent) had lived away from a rural area or small city for at least one month; of those, 71 percent had moved from an urban area. Twenty-seven percent of respondents indicated they had been infected locally. People with a history of injection drug use were less likely to have been infected locally than those who had no history of injection drug use (6 percent vs. 26 percent among men, 3 percent vs. 40 percent among women, P < 0.001). Further understanding of the role of socioeconomic factors in HIV transmission in rural areas and small cities is needed.

Of 6513 participants, 86 patients developed lymphoma and 46 of these (NHL, 30; HL, 16) were included in this analysis having stored prediagnostic blood. A total of 46 serum case samples matched 1:1 to lymphoma-free serum control samples were assayed for κ and λ sFLC levels and compared by using conditional logistic regression. Because the polyclonal nature of free light chains (FLCs) was the focus of our study, we introduced the k + λ sum as the measurement of choice and as the primary variable studied. κ + λ sFLC values were significantly higher in patient with lymphoma than in controls, especially when considering samples stored 0-2-year period before the lymphoma diagnosis. In the multivariable analysis, the elevation of sFLC predicted the risk of lymphoma independently of CD4 count, (odd ratio of 16.85 for k + λ sFLC >2-fold upper normal limit (UNL) vs. normal value). A significant reduction in the risk of lymphoma (odd ratio of 0.07 in model with k + λ sFLC) was found in people with low sFLC and undetectable HIV viremia lasting more than 6 months. Our analysis indicates that an elevated polyclonal sFLC is a strong and sensitive predictor of the risk of developing lymphomas, and it is an easy to measure biomarker that merits consideration for introduction in routine clinical practice in people with HIV."

While combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) can reduce plasma viral load (pVL) to undetectable levels, the degree that HIV is eliminated from other anatomical sites remains unclear. We investigated the HIV DNA levels in 229 varied autopsy tissues from 20 HIV-positive (HIV(+)) cART-treated study participants with low or undetectable plasma VL and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VL prior to death who were enrolled in the National Neurological AIDS Bank (NNAB) longitudinal study and autopsy cohort. Extensive medical histories were obtained for each participant. Autopsy specimens, including at least six brain and nonbrain tissues per participant, were reviewed by study pathologists. HIV DNA, measured in tissues by quantitative and droplet digital PCR, was identified in 48/87 brain tissues and 82/142 nonbrain tissues at levels >200 HIV copies/million cell equivalents. No participant was found to be completely free of tissue HIV. Parallel sequencing studies from some tissues recovered intact HIV DNA and RNA. Abnormal histological findings were identified in all participants, especially in brain, spleen, lung, lymph node, liver, aorta, and kidney. All brain tissues demonstrated some degree of pathology. Ninety-five percent of participants had some degree of atherosclerosis, and 75% of participants died with cancer. This study assists in characterizing the anatomical locations of HIV, in particular, macrophage-rich tissues, such as the central nervous system (CNS) and testis. Additional studies are needed to determine if the HIV recovered from tissues promotes the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, cancer, and atherosclerosis."

Data on heterosexually transmitted acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV for Australia are reviewed with emphasis given to the probability of misclassification bias in the heterosexually acquired and 'other/undetermined' categories. Tertiary cases are almost certainly rare in Australia, with little evidence of any increase in their incidence since the first cases were recorded. Three factors (low probability of exposure, the infectivity of HIV and a comparatively low rate of sexual partner change) make it improbable that Australian heterosexuals with no risk factors will experience endemic HIV infection, with a caveat to this conclusion lying in the potential of Australian sex tourism to Southeast Asia for introducing HIV into the Australian heterosexual population. Four hegemonic factors which have acted to suppress any serious debate of the notion that HIV in Australia is unlikely to become endemic among heterosexuals are discussed: the political 'democratization' of risk inspired by concerns that gay men should not be further vilified as a victim group; the preventive imperative; a reluctance among health educators to question the very foundations of the message they are employed to deliver; and a reluctance to curtail 'Trojan horse' benefits to sexually transmissible disease prevention engendered by HIV education promoting safe sex messages."
9632,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The high prevalence of free protein S deficiency in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients is poorly understood. We studied 38 HIV seropositive patients. Free protein S antigen values assayed using the polyethylene-glycol precipitation technique (PEG-fS) were statistically lower in patients than in controls. These values using a specific monoclonal antibody-based ELISA (MoAb-fS) and the values of protein S activity (S-act) were not statistically different between patients and controls. C4b-binding protein values were not different from control values. In patients, PEG-fS values were lower than MoAb-fS values. Ten patients had a PEG-fS deficiency, 4 patients had a MoAb-fS deficiency and 8 had a S-act deficiency. Protein S activity and MoAb-fS were lower in clinical groups with poor prognosis and in patients with AIDS but PEG-fS was not. A trend for reduced S-act/MoAb-fS ratios was observed in patients. PEG-fS was negatively correlated with anticardiolipin antibody titers whereas MoAb-fS was not. The plasma of PEG-fS deficient HIV-patients contained high amounts of flow cytometry detectable microparticles which were depleted from plasma by PEG precipitation. The microparticles were partly CD42b and CD4 positive but CD8 negative. These micro-particles were labelled by an anti free protein S monoclonal antibody. The observed differences between MoAb-fS and PEG-fS values were correlated with the amount of detectable plasma microparticles, just like the differences between MoAb-fS and S-act. Plasma microparticles correlated with anticardiolipin antibody titers. In summary, free protein S antigen in HIV infected patients is underestimated when the PEG precipitation technique is used due to the presence of elevated levels of microparticles that bind protein S. The activity of free protein S is also impaired by high levels of microparticles. The prevalence of free protein S deficiency in HIV positive patients is lower than previously published (4/38, approximately 10%) and is correlated with poor prognosis. By implication, use of a PEG precipitation technique might give artefactually low free protein S antigen values in other patient groups if high numbers of microparticles are present. In HIV patients, high titers of anticardiolipin antibodies are associated with high concentrations of cell-derived plasma microparticles."

A consecutive series of 647 women from the cohort was tested for antibodies for hepatitis B core antigen: 27 were positive, of whom six had been born in the United Kingdom and were not known to have been at risk. The two women who were seropositive for HIV who completed a questionnaire on their sexual behaviour before they were tested reported both anal and oral receipt of semen and were in the upper fifth percentile for lifetime sexual partners. More than half (53%) of 424 women who reported that they had non-regular sexual partners never used a condom.

In this multicenter, retrospective, longitudinal study, CD4 restoration was assessed according to HCV status in treatment-naive HIV-infected patients within 3 years of HAART. Only patients with persistent HIV suppression were included. Factors predicting CD4 gains were analyzed with multivariate linear regression. Out of 322 patients included 139 had positive HCV-RNA and 183 were only HIV infected. HCV-HIV-coinfected patients were older, more often ex-intravenous drug users (IVDU), and had less advanced HIV infection. Baseline CD4 count [OR -0.21 [95% CI (-0.34)-(-0.04)]; p = 0.01] and male sex [OR -0.19 [95% CI (-191.12)-(-10.87)]; p = 0.03] predicted smaller increments in absolute CD4 counts, and higher baseline CD4% [OR -0.38 [95% CI (-0.39)-(-0.21)]; p < 0.0001] and older age [OR -0.12 [95% CI (-0.23)-(-0.01)]; p = 0.03] predicted smaller gains in CD4% after 3 years of HAART. A history of IVDU was associated with smaller absolute CD4 count increases at 1 year of therapy [OR -0.20 [95% CI (-128.32)-(-16.24)]; p = 0.01]. Use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-only regimens and of zidovudine as part of the NRTI backbone was associated with smaller and greater gains in CD4%, respectively. HCV replication per se does not impair the CD4 restoration in HIV-infected patients successfully treated with antiretroviral therapy. Lower baseline CD4 counts are the strongest predictors of greater CD4 gains over a 3-year period, while a history of IVDU negatively affects CD4 restoration only early after the initiation of HAART."
2251,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Several mathematical models have been investigated for the description of viral dynamics in the human body: HIV-1 infection is a particular and interesting scenario, because the virus attacks cells of the immune system that have a role in the antibody production and its high mutation rate permits to escape both the immune response and, in some cases, the drug pressure. The viral genetic evolution is intrinsically a stochastic process, eventually driven by the drug pressure, dependent on the drug combinations and concentration: in this article the viral genotypic drug resistance onset is the main focus addressed. The theoretical basis is the modelling of HIV-1 population dynamics as a predator-prey system of differential equations with a time-dependent therapy efficacy term, while the viral genome mutation evolution follows a Poisson distribution. The instant probabilities of drug resistance are estimated by means of functions trained from in vitro phenotypes, with a roulette-wheel-based mechanisms of resistant selection. Simulations have been designed for treatments made of one and two drugs as well as for combination antiretroviral therapies. The effect of limited adherence to therapy was also analyzed. Sequential treatment change episodes were also exploited with the aim to evaluate optimal synoptic treatment scenarios."

Increased susceptibility to ritonavir has also been described in some viruses from antiretroviral agent-naive patients with primary HIV-1 infection in association with combinations of amino acid changes at polymorphic sites in the protease. Many of the viruses displaying increased susceptibility to protease inhibitors also had low replication capacity. In this retrospective study, we analyze the drug susceptibility phenotype and the replication capacity of virus isolates obtained at the peaks of viremia during five consecutive structured treatment interruptions in 12 chronically HIV-1-infected patients. Ten out of 12 patients had at least one sample with protease inhibitor hypersusceptibility (change </=0.4-fold) to one or more protease inhibitor. Hypersusceptibility to different protease inhibitors was observed at variable frequency, ranging from 38% to amprenavir to 11% to nelfinavir. Pairwise comparisons between susceptibilities for the protease inhibitors showed a consistent correlation among all pairs. There was also a significant relationship between susceptibility to protease inhibitors and replication capacity in all patients. Replication capacity remained stable over the course of repetitive cycles of structured treatment interruptions. We could find no association between in vitro replication capacity and in vivo plasma viral load doubling time and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell counts at each treatment interruption. Several mutations were associated with hypersusceptibility to each protease inhibitor in a univariate analysis. This study extends the association between hypersusceptibility to protease inhibitors and low replication capacity to virus isolated from chronically infected patients and highlights the complexity of determining the genetic basis of this phenomenon. The potential clinical relevance of protease inhibitor hypersusceptibility and low replication capacity to virologic response to protease inhibitor-based therapies deserves to be investigated further."

Perception of risk has been suggested as an important element of sexual behavior change among people who engage in behaviors that place them at risk of HIV infection. This study investigates perceived risk of an HIV infection among inhabitants of municipality of Palilula. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative accuracy of risk assessment, especially for those with high-risk sexual behavior and to assess the factors related to self perception of developing AIDS. The survey was conducted as a household survey in Belgrade municipality ""Palilula"". The design of the survey was based on a two-stage stratified random sample. The population of Palilula municipality was divided in two stratums and 840 households were selected from each stratum. All members of selected households aged 15-49 years were interviewed. Total of 2659 persons was interviewed. Self administered questionnaire, developed by WHO and described in the Evaluation of National AIDS Programme: A Methods Package 1. Prevention of HIV infection, Geneva, 1994, was translated and adapted for local application. For analysis of findings methods of descriptive statistics, chi square test and logistic regression were used. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS/PC. The results showed that most of the respondents (1662, 62.5%) do not perceive themselves to be at risk of HIV infection. Interestingly, almost one quarter of the sample couldn't estimate personal chances of being HIV infected. Significantly larger proportion of respondents living in urban area than those living in rural area perceived themselves at risk (17.1% of urban vs. 7.7% from rural area, chi square = 54.06, Ir0.00). Significant differences between age groups were found for perception of personal risk. Respondents up to 19 and those older than 25 in more than 60 percent and only a half of those between 20 and 24 believed that there was no chance they could become HIV infected. Almost 16% of respondents between 20 and 24 believed that they had some chances of contracting HIV, also approximately one third of them couldn't estimate personal risk of contracting HIV infection (chi square = 2.10, p = 0.00)(Graphe 1). Those who engaged in sex with irregular partners were found to perceive themselves in higher risk then those who were engaged in sex only with regular partners in previous 12 months. One fifth of those with irregular partners estimated their chances as good versus only 10% of those with only regular partners. A logistic regression analysis found that those who believed they were personally at risk knew someone with HIV, had more irregular sexual partners in last 12 months, were younger, and lived in urban area (Table 1). People correctly perceived the risk of HIV infection as being minimal as most of them didn't engage in risk behavior. Risk perception was higher among those who had more irregular partners, younger and those from urban area. Most important predictor of risk perception was knowledge of HIV positive individual."

An ""in-house"" NAT (Triplex NAT) was developed for screening for HBV DNA, hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA. Using the Triplex NAT, a head-to-head comparative clinical evaluation was carried out against the most common commercial NAT used for blood screening in China: the Procleix Tigris System. A total of 33,025 specimens which were negative for Hepatitis B surface antigen, HCV antibody and HIV-1 antibody/antigen from potential blood donors were tested for HBV DNA, HCV RNA, and HIV-1 RNA by both the in-house Triplex assay and the commercially available Procleix Tigris System. Eleven specimens were detected as HBV positive by both NATs. Twelve specimens were detected as HBV positive by the Procleix Ultrio assay and the discriminatory assays, and not the Triplex. Twenty-eight specimens were detected as HBV positive by the Triplex and not the Procleix Ultrio. This study, combined with other data obtained in China, suggest that at least 50% HBV surface antigen negative but DNA-positive blood donations would be undetected using the current commercial NATs because of their insufficient sensitivity and/or Mini-Pool formatting strategies."

We collected information on demographics and sexual behaviors and a blood sample for HIV genome RNA extraction, RT-PCR amplification, and DNA sequencing. Multiple alignments were made using Gene Cutter, with the selected reference sequences of various subtypes/recombinants from the Los Alamos HIV-1 database. Phylogenetic and Bayesian evolutionary analysis was performed by MEGA version 6.0, Fasttree v2.1.7. and BEAST v1.6.2. Categorical variables were analyzed using χ test (or Fisher exact test where necessary). χ test with trend was used to assess the evolution of HIV-1 subtype distribution over time. All data were analyzed using SPSS20.0 software package (IBM Company, New York, NY).HIV-1 phylogenetic analysis revealed a broad viral diversity including CRF01_AE (60.06%), CRF07_BC (22.29%), subtype B (5.88%), CRF67_01B (5.26%), CRF68_01B (2.79%), CRF55_01B (1.55%), CRF59_01B (0.93%), and CRF08_BC (0.62%). Two unique recombination forms (URFs) (0.62%) were also detected. Four epidemic clusters and 1 major cluster in CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC were identified. The introduction of CRF01_AE strain (2001) was earlier than CRF07_BC strain (2004) into MSM resided in Jiangsu based on the time of the most recent common ancestor.Our study demonstrated HIV-1 subtype diversity among ART-naïve MSM recently infected with HIV-1 in Jiangsu. We first depicted the spatiotemporal dynamics, traced the dates of origin for the HIV-1 CRF01_AE/07_BC strains and made inference for the effective population size among newly infected ART-naïve MSM in Jiangsu from 2012 to 2015. A real-time surveillance of HIV-1 viral diversity and phylodynamics of epidemic cluster would be of great value to the monitoring of the epidemic and control of transmission, improvement of antiretroviral therapy strategies, and design of vaccines."

Ninety-nine of 151 (65.6%) HDV-seropositive IDU had HDV viremia: 5 were infected with HDV genotype I, 41 with genotype II, 51 with genotype IV, and 2 with genotypes II and IV. In the phylogenetic analysis, only one cluster of 4 strains within the HDV genotype II was identified. Among patients with HCV viremia, a unique cluster within genotype 1a was observed; yet, patients within this cluster did not overlap with those observed in the HDV phylogenetic analysis. In summary, although IDU had a significantly higher HDV seroprevalence, molecular epidemiologic investigations did not support that HDV was introduced at the same time as HCV among IDU."

However, our understanding of the prevalence of IR, the underlying mechanisms and predisposing factors is limited, particularly among minority populations. We conducted a study of 333 Hispanic adults including: 76 HIV monoinfected, 62 HCV monoinfected, 97 HIV/HCV co-infected and 98 uninfected controls with a specific focus on HCV infection and liver injury as possible predictors of IR. IR was measured using the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI). The majority (55-69%) of participants in all groups had QUICKI values <0.350. Body mass index was associated with IR in all groups. Triglycerides were associated with IR in the uninfected control group only (-1.83, SE = 0.58, P = 0.0022). HCV was associated with IR in participants infected with HIV (-0.012, SE = 0.0046, P = 0.010). Liver injury, as measured by score to assess liver injury (FIB-4) score, was significantly associated with IR independently of HCV infection (-0.0035, SE = 0.0016, P = 0.027). In the HIV/HCV co-infected group, treatment with nucleoside reverse-transcriptase (RT) inhibitors plus non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (-0.021, SE = 0.080, P = 0.048), but not protease inhibitors (-0.000042, SE = 0.0082, P = 0.96) was associated with IR. HCV infection and antiretroviral agents, including nucleoside RT inhibitor plus non-nucleoside RT inhibitor treatment are contributors to IR in HIV infection. Liver injury, as measured by the FIB-4 score, is a predictor of IR independently of HCV infection."

Both hepatotropic viruses can cause a severe clinical picture in HIV-infected individuals with rapid progression of liver disease, cirrhosis and increased mortality. Fortunately, treatment options of HBV and HCV are becoming well established and may have a clinical impact in slowing disease progression. This, coupled with the fact that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has increased the life expectancy of HIV-infected patients stresses the importance of management of concurrent illnesses such as HBV and HCV infection, taking into consideration pharmacokinetic interaction with components of HAART regimens."

The present study evaluated morbidity and mortality variation in HIV-infected patients with and without HCV co-infection. Co-infection prevalence was determined in 356 HIV-infected persons. Their clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, risk factors, HIV therapies, and mortality rates were evaluated. The prevalence of HCV was 54% in the overall group and 81% in IDUs, with a predominance of HCV genotype 1. Mortality rates were similar in patients with and without co-infection; however, co-infected patients had significantly higher liver damage as a cause of mortality when compared with those who were not co-infected. The high prevalence of HCV and an emerging mortality from liver diseases showed the significance of this co-infection in the HIV epidemic. Primary and secondary prevention are necessary to reduce the expanding impact of HCV infection in HIV patients."

To investigate the prevalence of HIV-1 infection and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection among injection drug users (IDUs) in southeastern Yunnan, three cohorts of 285 addicts, including 242 IDUs and 43 oral drug users, living in the cities of Gejiu and Kaiyuan and the county of Yanshan were studied. HIV-1 and HCV infections were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or polymerase chain reaction. Data on the age, sex, risk behavior, drug use history, employment, ethnic background, and marriage status were obtained by interview. The overall prevalence of HIV-1 infection was 71.9%. The rate of HCV coinfection among 138 HIV-1-infected IDUs was 99.3%. Most HIV-infected IDUs were 20 to 35 years old (86.7%) and were ethnic Han (75.9%), suggesting that the epidemic in Yunnan is no longer confined to non-Han ethnic minorities. HIV prevalence in female IDUs (81.2%) was significantly higher than in male IDUs (68.2%) ( p <.05). The prevalence of HIV infection reached 68.4% after 1 year of injection drug use.

Positive prevention (PP) programs, which prioritize HIV prevention with people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHIV), have been recognized as an important intervention for preventing new HIV infections. To address this, an evidence-based PP training intervention was implemented with HIV healthcare providers in Mozambique. This study focuses on the acceptability and feasibility of a PP intervention in HIV clinics from the healthcare provider perspective. In-depth interviews were conducted with 31 healthcare providers from three provinces who participated in PP trainings in Mozambique. Interview data were coded using content analysis. Study data suggest that healthcare providers found PP acceptable, feasible to implement in their HIV work in clinic settings, and valued this strategy to improve HIV prevention. The PP training also led providers to feel more comfortable counseling their patients about prevention, with a more holistic approach that included HIV testing, treatment and encouraging PLHIV to live positively. While overall acceptance of the PP training was positive, several barriers to feasibility surfaced in the data. Patient-level barriers included resistance to disclosing HIV status due to fear of stigma and discrimination, difficulty negotiating for condom use, difficulty engaging men in testing and treatment, and the effects of poverty on accessing care. Providers also identified work environment barriers including high patient load, time constraints, and frequent staff turnover. Recognizing PP as an important intervention, healthcare providers should be trained to provide comprehensive prevention, care and treatment for PLHIV. Further work is needed to explore the complex social dynamics and cultural challenges such as gender inequalities, stigma and discrimination which hinder the full impact of PP interventions in this context.

Among patients with chronic liver diseases including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the overall prevalence rate for anti-HCV was 34.1% (42/123), and a higher prevalence was noted in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative cases than in HBsAg-positive cases. The prevalence of anti-HCV in volunteer blood donors and high prevalence found in IVDUs, hemodialysis patients, anti-HIV positive cases, and FPs are consistent with those results from other countries. These findings suggest that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is transmitted by both blood-borne and sexual contact routes. Among flavivirus infections, anti-HCV was detected in 0.3% (1/289) and 1.3% (4/310) of Japanese encephalitis and dengue fever patients, respectively. In conclusion, in Taiwan, an area with high endemicity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the epidemiological status of HCV infection is similar to that observed in other countries, and no serum cross-reactivity was noticed between HCV and flavivirus infections."
15660,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Initial reports have suggested that approximately 10% of patients with HIV-infection develop HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). It has also been predicted that by the end of the decade, HIVAN is likely to become a third leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in African-Americans between the ages of 20-64 years. As the morbidity and mortality from HIV-infection has decreased in the last few years, it is possible that prevalence of HIVAN is also changing. We therefore screened HIV-1-infected patients followed in our hospital for HIVAN. A screening urinalysis was performed in 557 HIV-1-infected adult patients between March and May 1998. Of these, 252 were outpatients and 305 were Texas Department of Criminal Justice inmates (TDCJI). Demographic and laboratory data of these patients was obtained from the HIV patients' database. Fifty percent of the patients were African-American, 36.6% were Caucasian and 12. 7% were Hispanic. The mean age of patients was 37 +/- 8 years. Seventy-nine percent of the patients were males and a history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) was present in 28%. Twenty-three percent of the patients were concomitantly infected with hepatitis C virus, 4.1% were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, and rapid plasma reagin test for syphilis was positive in 9.1%. In 38 patients who had more than 100 mg/dl (2+) proteins on screening urinalysis, total urinary proteins were quantitated by collecting 24 h urine specimens. Fifteen of these patients had urinary proteins more than 1.5 g/day (12 patients >3.5 g/24 h and 3 patients >1.5 g/24 h). A renal biopsy was done in 14 of these patients and clinical diagnosis of HIVAN was made in one patient who refused biopsy. Renal biopsies revealed HIVAN [9], diabetic nephropathy [2], membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis [2], Fibrillary glomerulonephritis [1]. All 10 patients (5 TDCJI and 5 outpatients) with HIVAN were African-American. Two of these 10 patients had a history of IVDA and another two were concomitantly infected with hepatitis C virus. The plasma viral load (Pvl) and total CD4 count was not different in patients with or without HIVAN [(Pvl log 10.05 +/- 1.39 vs. 9.9 +/- 2.18 copies/ml, p = 0.78) (CD4: 187 +/- 192 vs. 288 +/- 249 cells/microl, p = 1.17) mean +/- SD]. We conclude that in our HIV-infected population HIVAN exclusively affected African-Americans and the prevalence in them was 3.5%."

Because the FRT is a primary site of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in women, we determined whether soluble factors secreted by uterine-derived NK (uNK) cells inhibit HIV-1 infection. Clonal populations of uNK cells were activated with interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-15, and conditioned media (CM) from these cultures evaluated for their ability to inhibit infection of cells by HIV-1(IIIB), HIV-1(NL4.3), and HIV-1(HC4) (X4-tropic) or HIV-1(BaL) (R5-tropic) viruses. We found that soluble factors secreted by activated uNK cells significantly inhibited X4-tropic virus infection of TZM-bl cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and primary human endometrial cells, but not infection by HIV-1(BaL). In contrast, CM from peripheral blood NK (bNK) cells did not inhibit HIV-1 infection of cells. Analysis of factors secreted from uNK clones with anti-HIV-1 activity demonstrated significantly higher levels of CXCL12 compared to uNK clones without this activity, and the HIV inhibitory activity was neutralized by antibodies to CXCL12. Collectively, these data demonstrate that human uNK cells release chemokines with anti-HIV-1 activity for X4-tropic strains and this suggest that these chemokines may contribute to the inhibition of X4-tropic strain transmission across mucosal tissues."

Group I consisted of 984 patients (859 men and 125 women) with biopsy-proven chronic type B hepatitis, whereas group II consisted of 1,598 asymptomatic chronic carriers (998 men and 600 women) with normal serum aminotransferase activity. During a mean follow-up period of 4.0 +/- 2.3 yr, 19 patients (1.9%) of group I cleared HBsAg from their serum, whereas 35 patients (2.2%) in group II did so in a mean follow-up period of 2.7 +/- 1.4 yr. The annual incidence of delayed serum HBsAg clearance was 0.5% in group I and 0.8% in group II (p less than 0.02). The cumulative probability of HBsAg clearance was also higher in group II than in group I (p less than 0.007). Antibodies to HBsAg developed in 9 patients (47.4%) with chronic hepatitis and in 11 (31.4%) asymptomatic carriers who cleared serum HBsAg. Those who were HBeAg negative and those older than 40 at entry and those who exhibited cirrhosis during follow-up had a higher incidence of delayed HBsAg clearance. Gender, initial histological changes and hepatitis delta virus infection did not influence the occurrence of HBsAg clearance. Serum HBV DNA was not detectable by slot-blot hybridization but was still detectable by polymerase chain reaction in serum specimens collected within 1 yr of HBsAg clearance. Liver biopsy performed later in 10 patients showed no significant hepatitis activity or tissue HBV DNA, HBsAg or HBcAg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Sixty human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected subjects, including 13, 20, and 10 subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, and a comparator group of 17 subjects with normal hepatic function, were enrolled. Subjects with normal hepatic function received fosamprenavir at 700 mg plus ritonavir at 100 mg twice daily, whereas subjects with hepatic impairment received adjusted doses in anticipation of increased exposures. For subjects with mild hepatic impairment, the studied regimen of fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily plus ritonavir 100 mg once daily delivered 17% higher values for the maximum plasma amprenavir concentration at the steady state (C(max)), 22% higher values for the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve over the dosing interval at the steady state [AUC(0-tau)], similar values for the concentration at the end of the dosing interval (C(tau)), and 114% higher unbound C(tau) values. For subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, the studied dosage regimen of fosamprenavir at 300 mg twice daily plus ritonavir at 100 mg once daily delivered 27% lower plasma amprenavir C(max) values, 27% lower AUC(0-24) values, 57% lower C(tau) values, and 21% higher unbound amprenavir C(tau) values. For subjects with severe hepatic impairment, the studied dosage regimen of fosamprenavir at 300 mg twice daily plus ritonavir at 100 mg once daily delivered 19% lower plasma amprenavir C(max) values, 23% lower AUC(0-24) values, 38% lower C(tau) values, and similar unbound amprenavir C(tau) values. With a reduced ritonavir dosing frequency of 100 mg once daily, the plasma ritonavir AUC(0-24) values were 39% lower, similar, and 40% higher for subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. The results of the study support the use of reduced fosamprenavir/ritonavir doses or dosing frequencies in the treatment of patients with hepatic impairment. No significant safety issues were identified; however, plasma amprenavir and ritonavir exposures were more variable in subjects with hepatic impairment, and those patients should be closely monitored for safety and virologic response."
406,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors have dramatically improved treatment options for HIV infection, but frequent dosing may impact adherence to highly active antiretroviral treatment regimens (HAART). Previous studies demonstrated that combined therapy with ritonavir and saquinavir allows a decrease in frequency of saquinavir dosing to twice daily. In this study, we evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of combining once-daily doses of the soft-gel capsule (SGC) formulation of saquinavir (saquinavir-SGC) and minidose ritonavir. Forty-four healthy HIV-negative volunteers were randomized into groups receiving once-daily doses of saquinavir-SGC (1,200 to 1,800 mg) plus ritonavir (100 to 200 mg) or a control group receiving only saquinavir-SGC (1,200 mg) three times daily. Saquinavir-SGC alone and saquinavir-SGC-ritonavir combinations were generally well tolerated, and there were no safety concerns. Addition of ritonavir (100 mg) to saquinavir-SGC (1,200 to 1,800 mg/day) increased the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for saquinavir severalfold, and the intersubject peak concentration in plasma and AUC variability were reduced compared to those achieved with saquinavir-SGC alone (3,600 mg/day), while trough saquinavir levels (24 h post-dose) were substantially higher than the 90% inhibitory concentration calculated from HIV-1 clinical isolates. Neither increasing the saquinavir-SGC dose to higher than 1,600 mg nor increasing ritonavir from 100 to 200 mg appeared to further enhance the AUC. These results suggest that an all once-daily HAART regimen, utilizing saquinavir-SGC plus a more tolerable low dose of ritonavir, may be feasible. Studies of once-daily saquinavir-SGC (1,600 mg) in combination with ritonavir (100 mg) in HIV-infected patients are underway."

By 2 years after infection, 35% of HISIS subjects developed neutralization breadth, compared with 9% of CAPRISA subjects (P = .0131). Cumulative viral loads between 3 and 12 months were higher in the HISIS group (P = .046) and strongly associated with breadth (P < .0001). While viral load was the strongest predictor, other factors may play a role, as the odds of developing breadth remained higher in HISIS even after correction for viral load. "

The needs for these ancillary services among Hispanics/Latinos are not well described (2). To obtain nationally representative estimates of and reasons for unmet needs for such services among Hispanic/Latino adults receiving outpatient HIV medical care during 2013-2014, CDC analyzed data from the Medical Monitoring Project (MMP).

Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antibody were tested for at the first visit by RIA or EIA; HIV-1 antibody testing was done at each visit by ELISA and confirmed by Western blot assay. The role of HBV infection in HIV-1 seroconversion was studied by stratification for sexual behavior and disease visit by visit. The adjusted risk ratio was 2.02 for hepatitis B surface antigen carriers and 2.14 for hepatitis-immune cases compared with hepatitis B-susceptible subjects. Similar results were obtained using a logistic regression model.

Pregnancy is often a time when women are motivated to make major positive behavioral and life-style changes. To do this, they need ongoing, multidisciplinary counseling and support, with recognition that progress may be intermittent and slow. The Special Prenatal Care Program at Bellevue Hospital is described to show the level of resource commitment that is needed as well as the nearly universal acceptance of voluntary HIV counseling and testing in these conditions.

The oligomerization of recombinant Nef protein was studied by NMR spectroscopy and immunoblotting under various experimental conditions. 1H-NMR spectroscopy shows that native folded protein has the tendency to polymerize under low-salt conditions. These oligomers become covalently linked by disulfide bonds after decreasing the reduction potential, a process which is fully reversible. Cross-linking studies with bis(sulfo-succinimidyl)suberate and alkylation with iodoacetic acid under non-reducing and reducing conditions document for the first time that Nef can also form homomeric structures including monomers, dimers, trimers and tetramers in cell lysates and intact cells. We found disulfide-linked as well as non-covalently associated oligomers. Since the Nef molecules are not exclusively found in the cytoplasm of HIV infected cells and since the reduced glutathione concentration in lymphocytes of virus infected persons is known to be unusually low, it might be possible that these Nef oligomers have a biological function in vivo as well."

In the present study, we examined the susceptibility as well as the cellular responses of IPCs to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. HLA-DR(+) CD11c(-) lineage-negative cells (IPCs) were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by magnetic-bead separation and cell sorting. We substantiated that IPCs expressing the major HIV-1 coreceptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, are susceptible to infection of both T-cell-line-tropic NL4-3 and macrophage-tropic JR-CSF HIV-1 by quantification of HIV-1 p24 in the culture supernatants and by provirus integration assay using human conserved Alu-HIV-1 long terminal repeat PCR. To evaluate the cellular response of IPCs to HIV-1, we examined IFN-alpha production and their differentiation into DCs. After incubation with either NL4-3 or JR-CSF, IPCs produced a large amount of IFN-alpha and at the same time underwent morphological differentiation into DCs with upregulation of CD80 and CD86. Heat inactivation of the supernatants containing HIV-1 did not affect the IFN-alpha production and maturation, whereas removal of virions by ultracentrifugation completely nullified both biological effects, indicating that these cellular responses do not require actual HIV-1 infection but are elicited by interaction with HIV-1 virions or certain viral components. In conclusion, these data strongly suggest that IPC can directly recognize and respond to HIV-1 with IFN-alpha production, which is crucial for preventing progress of HIV-1 infection and occurrence of opportunistic infection."

Both viruses code for a protease that is essential for replication and therefore represents a key target for drugs interfering with viral infection. The retroviral proteases from HIV-1 and HTLV-I share 31% sequence identity and high structural similarities. Yet, their substrate specificities and inhibition profiles differ substantially. In this study, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for both enzymes in their ligand-free states and in complex with model substrates in order to compare their dynamic behaviors and enhance our understanding of the correlation between sequence, structure, and dynamics in this protein family. We found extensive similarities in both local and overall protein dynamics, as well as in the energetics of their interactions with model substrates. Interestingly, those residues that are important for strong ligand binding are frequently not conserved in sequence, thereby offering an explanation for the differences in binding specificity. Moreover, we identified an interaction network of contacts between conserved residues that interconnects secondary structure elements and serves as a scaffold for the protein fold. This interaction network is conformationally stable over time and may provide an explanation for the highly similar dynamic behavior of the two retroviral proteases, even in the light of their rather low overall sequence identity."

HIV-infected patients have a high incidence of tuberculous meningitis as well. The exact incidence and prevalence of tuberculous meningitis in HIV-infected patients are not known. HIV infection does not significantly alter the clinical manifestations, laboratory, radiographic findings, or the response to therapy. Still, some differences have been noted. For example, the histopathological examination of exudates in HIV-infected patients shows fewer lymphocytes, epithelioid cells, and Langhan's type of giant cells. Larger numbers of acid-fast bacilli may be seen in the cerebral parenchyma and meninges. The chest radiograph is abnormal in up to 46% of patients with tuberculous meningitis. Tuberculous meningitis is likely to present with cerebral infarcts and mass lesions. Cryptococcal meningitis is important in differential diagnosis. The recommended duration of treatment in HIV-infected patients is 9-12 months. The benefit of adjunctive corticosteroids is uncertain. Antiretroviral therapy and antituberculosis treatment should be initiated at the same time, regardless of CD4 cell counts. Tuberculous meningitis may be a manifestation of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Some studies have demonstrated a significant impact of HIV co-infection on mortality from tuberculous meningitis. HIV-infected patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculous meningitis have significantly higher mortality. The best way to prevent HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis is to diagnose and isolate infectious cases of tuberculosis promptly and administer appropriate treatment."

Mean age ± SD of participants was 39.9 ± 10.5 years; 68% were women, and 78% were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). A total of 58% reported severe household food insecurity. After controlling for age, gender, income, having children at home, education, and ART status, severe food insecurity was associated with increased body mass index (BMI) (β = 1.891, p = 0.023) and body fat (β = 4.004, p = 0.007). Age and female gender were also associated with increased body fat (β = 0.259, p < 0.001 and β = 8.568, p < 0.001, respectively) and age and ART status were associated with increased waist circumference (β = 0.279, p = 0.011 and β = 5.768, p = 0.046, respectively). When overweight was examined as a dichotomous variable (BMI ≥ 25.0), severe food insecurity was associated with an increased odds of 3.060 (p = 0.013); no other covariates were independently associated with overweight. The association of severe food insecurity with increased BMI, body fat, and overweight among PLHIV has important implications for clinical care as well as food security and nutrition interventions in resource-poor settings. Integrated programs that combine nutrition education or counseling with sustainable approaches to addressing food insecurity among PLHIV are needed to improve long-term health outcomes of this vulnerable population."

Previous studies have demonstrated that decreased peripheral leukocyte telomere length is associated with HIV, suggesting an accelerated aging phenomenon. We demonstrate that this process of telomere shortening also occurs in the lungs, with significant decreases in telomere length observed in small airway epithelial cells collected during bronchoscopy. Molecular evidence of accelerated aging in the small airway epithelium of persons living with HIV may be one clue into the predisposition for chronic lung disease observed in this population."

To determine whether early mortality is dropping as treatment thresholds have increased, we reviewed studies of 3 months on ART initiation in low- to middle-income countries. Studies of 3-month mortality from January 2003 to April 2016 were searched in 5 databases. Articles were included that reported 3-month mortality from a low- to middle-income country; nontrial setting and participants were ≥15. We assessed overall mortality and stratified by year using random effects models. Among 58 included studies, although not significant, pooled estimates show a decline in mortality when comparing studies whose enrollment of patients ended before 2010 (7.0%; 95% CI: 6.0 to 8.0) with the studies during or after 2010 (4.0%; 95% CI: 3.0 to 5.0). To continue to reduce early HIV-related mortality at the population level, intensified efforts to increase demand for ART through active testing and facilitated referral should be a priority. Continued financial investments by multinational partners and the implementation of creative interventions to mitigate multidimensional complex barriers of accessing care and treatment for HIV are needed.

To estimate the impact of these infections, a new cohort was established. All HCV-seropositive patients, age 13-88 years, at 52 comprehensive haemophilia treatment centres were eligible. Cross-sectional data collected during April 2001 to January 2004 (median June 2002) were analysed. Plasma HIV-1 and HCV RNA were quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was defined as use of at least three recommended medications. Among 2069 participants, 620 (30%) had HIV-1. Of 1955 with known HBV status, 814 (42%) had resolved HBV and 90 (4.6%) were HBV carriers. Although 80% of the HIV-1-positive participants had > or = 200 CD4+ cells microL(-1), only 59% were on HAART. HIV-1 RNA was undetectable in 23% of those not taking antiretroviral medications. Most (72%) participants had received no anti-HCV therapy. HCV RNA was detected less frequently (59%) among participants treated with standard interferon plus ribavirin (P = 0.0001) and more frequently among HIV-1-positive than HIV-1-negative participants (85% vs. 70%, P < 0.0001). HIV-1-positive participants were more likely to have pancytopenia and subclinical hepatic abnormalities, as well as persistent jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and ascites. HAART recipients did not differ from HIV-negative participants in the prevalence of ascites. The clinical abnormalities were more prevalent with older age but were not confounded by HBV status or self-reported alcohol consumption. Eleven participants presented with or previously had hepatocellular carcinoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although prospective analysis is needed, our data reveal the scale of hepatic and haematological disease that is likely to manifest in the adult haemophilic population during the coming years unless most of them are successfully treated for HIV-1, HCV or both."

The purpose of this article is to take the recommendations from these documents and help guide clinicians--whether they are primary care providers, hepatologists, gastroenterologists, or public health workers--about how to incorporate these guidelines into practice. The first task is for all providers to be involved in identifying persons with chronic HBV infection (CHB). New recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advocate screening for the HBV in those at highest risk, especially persons from countries where HBV is endemic. Using information from the clinical and laboratory evaluation of the patient infected with HBV, especially the hepatitis B e antigen/antibody status, clinicians can classify the patient into 1 of the 4 phases of HBV infection. Because CHB is a dynamic process and patients can move from inactive to active infection status, and vice versa, all patients must be followed with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase monitoring every 3 to 12 months for life. Those with elevated ALT and HBV DNA levels (>2,000 IU/mL) should be referred to a specialist for evaluation for possible treatment. Patients selected for antiviral therapy with nucleoside analogues should be followed every 3 to 6 months to detect emergence of antiviral resistance to the agent chosen. In addition, alpha-fetoprotein should be tested and ultrasound performed on all men aged >40 years and women >50 years of age to detect any hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in an early stage. Algorithms are included for primary care providers providing information on initial evaluation and management and referral of persons with CHB, and for specialists evaluating and treating HBV. Implementing steps to identify, follow, refer, and treat appropriately persons with CHB infection by all primary care and specialist healthcare providers can have a major impact on reducing the occurrence of HCC and cirrhosis in infected persons."

Correlates of high HCV-RNA load in individuals with haemophilia are largely unknown. Among 1266 interferon naïve HCV-infected individuals with haemophilia, we compared those with high (> 2 x 10⁶ HCV-RNA copies/mL) to lower viral load, overall and stratifying on HIV co-infection status using logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Overall, high HCV load was independently associated with longer duration of HCV infection (P(trend)=0.0001), body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m² (OR=1.4, 95% CI=1.1-1.9), and HIV co-infection (OR=1.4, 95% CI=1.0-1.8). Among 795 HIV-negative participants, high HCV-RNA load was associated with older age at HCV acquisition (OR=1.9 for > 15 years vs ≤ 2 years, P(trend)=0.008), and lower AST/platelet ratio (P(trend)=0.01), in addition to longer duration of HCV infection (P(trend)=0.0008), and body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m² (OR=1.6, P=0.005). Among 471 HIV-positive individuals, anti-retroviral therapy (ART) was the only variable associated with high HCV-RNA load (OR=1.8, CI=1.1-2.9 for combination ART; OR=1.8, CI=0.9-3.4, for other ART vs no treatment). High HCV-RNA load with haemophilia is more likely with longer duration of infection, older age at infection, higher body mass index, and antiretroviral therapy. These findings may help identify individuals at increased risk of HCV treatment failure and progression to end-stage liver disease."

However, HBV infections among those immunized subjects have been reported. The long-term efficacy of postnatal passive-active HB vaccination in high-risk subjects is not well explored. A total of 8,733 senior high school students who were born after July 1987 were assayed for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs). The overall HBsAg and anti-HBs-positive rates were 1.9% and 48.3%, respectively. The HBsAg-positive rate was 15% in HB immunoglobulin (HBIG) recipients (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 15.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.99-22.22). Among students who did not receive HBIG, there was a significantly negative association between HB vaccination dosage and HBsAg-positive rate (P for trend = 0.011). Adjusted ORs for those who received 4, 3, and 1 to 2 doses were 1.00, 1.52 (95% CI: 0.91-2.53), and 2.85 (95% CI: 1.39-5.81), respectively. Among HBIG recipients, the HBsAg-positive rate was significantly higher in subjects with maternal hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positivity and who received HBIG off-schedule. A booster dose of HB vaccination was administered to 1974 HBsAg- and anti-HBs-negative subjects. Prebooster and a postbooster blood samples were drawn for anti-HBs quantification. The proportions of postbooster anti-HBs titer <10 mIU/mL was 27.9%. Subjects with prebooster anti-HBs titers of 1.0-9.9 mIU/mL had significantly higher postbooster anti-HBs titers than those with prebooster anti-HBs titers of <1.0 mIU/mL (P < 0.0001)."

Nonetheless, HIV-associated tuberculosis continues to occur in countries where HAART is widely used. To identify the characteristics of HIV-infected persons who develop tuberculosis in the context of the availability of HAART, the current authors analysed data taken from 271 patients diagnosed, in Italy, during 1999-2000. These patients represent 0.7% of the 40,413 HIV-infected patients cared for in the clinical units participating in this current study. From the data it was observed that 20 patients (7.4%) had a previous episode of tuberculosis whose treatment was not completed. Eighty-one patients (29.9%) were diagnosed with HIV at tuberculosis diagnosis, 108 (39.8%) were aware of their HIV status but were not on antiretroviral treatment and 82 (30.3%) were on antiretroviral treatment. Patients on antiretroviral treatment were significantly less immunosuppressed than patients with HIV diagnosed concurrently with tuberculosis, or other patients not on antiretrovirals (median CD4 lymphocytes count: 220 cells x mm(-3) versus 100 cells x mm(-3), and 109 cells x mm(-3), respectively). No significant differences in clinical presentation of tuberculosis according to antiretroviral therapy status were recorded. Failure of tuberculosis control interventions (e.g. noncompletion of treatment) and of HIV care (delayed diagnosis of HIV infection and suboptimal uptake of therapy) may contribute to continuing occurrence of HIV-associated tuberculosis in a country where highly active antiretroviral therapy is largely available. However, a significant proportion of cases occur in patients who are on antiretroviral treatment."

In sub-Saharan Africa, up to 45% of HIV-infected women desire to have more children. HIV viral load assessment is not routinely available in low-resource countries for monitoring adherence and response to antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, in these settings, timed unprotected intercourse without assurance of HIV viral suppression may pose unnecessary risks. TVI, a simple and affordable intervention, can be considered an adjunct method and option of safer conception for HIV prevention with treatment of the HIV-infected partner and/or pre-exposure prophylaxis. We conducted five mixed and single-sex focus group discussions comprised of 33 HIV-serodiscordant couples and health-care providers in the Nyanza region of Kenya to assess the acceptability and feasibility of TVI as a safer method of conception. The transcribed data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. We found that educating and counseling HIV-serodiscordant couples on TVI could make it an acceptable and feasible safer conception method when associated with frequent communication and home visits by health-care providers. The findings of this study indicate that implementation studies that integrate training and counseling of HIV-serodiscordant couples and health-care providers on TVI combined with consistent condom use are needed. Acknowledging and supporting the reproductive choice and needs of female positive, male negative HIV-serodiscordant couples who desire children should also include the use of assisted reproductive services at the same time as pharmaceutical options that prevent sexual HIV transmission."
11564,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The possible mechanisms of neutropenia associated with both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and drug treatment in adults are examined, and the current and investigational strategies for managing neutropenia are reviewed. Neutropenia associated with HIV arises from diverse mechanisms, including cellular immune dysfunction, direct effects on progenitor cells, humoral immune dysfunction, and vitamin deficiencies. Drug-induced neutropenia may be related to direct cytotoxic effects, immunologic mediators, and the effects of vitamin depletion on the bone marrow. Bone marrow toxicity in patients receiving zidovudine appears to be more frequent in those patients with advanced disease, low CD4 cell counts, a pretreatment anemia, low serum vitamin B12 levels, and low or low normal serum folic acid levels. Patients with AIDS also are at increased risk for adverse events associated with folate antagonists and sulfonamides compared with other patient populations. Lithium therapy has improved neutrophil counts in patients receiving zidovudine; however, the toxicities associated with use of lithium, combined with the lower dosages of zidovudine now recommended, may obviate its use. The use of colony-stimulating factors appears promising for increasing the number and function of circulating neutrophils. Although concomitant use of interferon alfa and zidovudine may result in a strong synergistic anti-HIV effect, dose-limiting neutropenia has been reported in patients receiving the combination. There are currently no controlled data assessing the effectiveness of intravenous immune globulin in the treatment of HIV-related or drug-related neutropenia. In evaluating neutropenia, the clinician must attempt to discern whether the neutropenia is more likely related to disease state(s) or drug therapies. Potential management strategies include modulation of the disease state, discontinuation or dose reduction of the offending agent, or administration of exogenous immune enhancer."

To determine the association between PM and MTCT of HIV-1, we performed a secondary analysis of data from a clinical trial of antibiotics to reduce chorioamnionitis. Data regarding 1,662 HIV-1-infected women with live born singleton and first-born twin infants with information regarding PM and infant HIV-1 infection status at birth were analyzed. At the time of the study, women did not have access to antiretroviral drugs for treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome but had received nevirapine prophylaxis to reduce the risk of MTCT of HIV-1. Placental malaria was not associated with the infant HIV-1 infection status at birth (P = 0.67). Adjustment for maternal plasma viral load and CD4+ cell count did not change these results (odds ratio = 1.06, 95% confidence interval = 0.51-2.20, P = 0.87). Placental malaria was more likely to be related to HIV-1 infection at birth among women with low viral load at baseline (P for interaction = 0.08). In conclusion, PM was not associated with infant HIV-1 infection status at birth. The interaction of maternal plasma viral load, PM, and MTCT of HIV-1 warrants further studies."

HAART-associated improvement of the immune status might convert a clinically silent MAC infection into an active mycobacterial disease. A 40-year-old man with severe factor VII deficiency, advanced HIV-1 disease, a CD4 + lymphocyte count of 15 cells microL-1 (CDC stage A3) and 470,000 HIV-RNA copies mL-1 (measurement by NASBA system) underwent standard HAART (lamivudine, stavudine and ritonavir). Two weeks after HAART onset, the patient developed enlargement of the lymph nodes throughout the mesentery and after seven weeks a rapidly enlarging mass on the left side of the neck. Culture from a needle aspirate specimen revealed MAC. His CD4 + count had increased to 97 cells microL-1 and viraemia dropped to undetectable HIV-RNA copies. While continuing antiviral therapy, multidrug therapy for MAC infection (clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ethambutol, amikacin) was started with progressive improvement and cure of the neck mycobacterial infection and disappearance of the abdominal lymph nodes. HAART has been shown to offer significant clinical and laboratory benefits in terms of HIV disease with limited side-effects in Haemophiliacs. However, the clinical manifestation of an opportunistic infection should be mentioned as a possible complication of HAART in these patients, as well as in other categories of HIV infected patients, and in patients with congenital coagulopathies."

Patients were followed up by HIV RNA levels, T lymphocyte subsets, blood routine test, and biochemical parameters. If active opportunistic infections, apparent side effects or virological failure appeared, appropriate treatment would be taken immediately. 30 patients (6.86%) died, most in the first 6 months of HAART. The proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA <500 copies/ml was 90.8%, 63.5%, 69.4%, 70.0% and 72.2% at 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 year. The CD4+ T cell count was 115, 246, 301, 334, 363, 356,386 and 373 cells/ul at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 year. 67.9% showed various drug-related side effects, most including gastrointestinal side-effects, nervous disorder, myelotoxicity and abnormal liver function, rashes, serum cholesterol elevation, mostly appearing in the first 12 months. Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events occurred in 41 cases. This is the first to report results from the prospectively 7-year follow-up of Chinese patients infected HIV taking HAART. It demonstrates that two NRTIs and one NNRTI regimens may persistently suppress HIV viremia and continuously induce CD4 cell increase, with good safety and tolerance. The majority took first-line regimens effectively. 19.2% changed to other first-line drug due to drug-related side effects, 10.2% switched to second-line regimens due to viral resistance.

Logistic regression was used to determine the effects of CD4+ cell count and HIV RNA level on potent ART initiation during 6-month periods among 2,059 HIV-infected US women enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Low CD4+ counts and high HIV RNA levels were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with initiation of potent ART. During all periods between April 1996 and March 1998, CD4+ counts were more strongly associated with potent ART initiation than HIV RNA levels were; however, during the last period, both were associated (odds ratio per 100 CD4+-count decrease = 1.17, p < 0.01; odds ratio per 1 log10 increase in HIV RNA level = 1.48, p < 0.05). For a CD4+ count of 500 cells/ml and an HIV RNA level of 5,000 copies/ml, the probability of potent ART initiation increased from 0.5% to 16.8% between October 1995-March 1996 and October 1997-March 1998, suggesting earlier initiation of potent ART. Given the documented occurrence of confounding by indication, prospectively collected, time-dependent data on markers of disease progression and therapy use should be considered when making population-level comparisons before and after introduction of potent ART."

Even, the human immunodeficiency virus primarily effects the immune system, HIV infection also has an impact on other organs. Cardiovascular manifestations in HIV-infected patients could occur by the HI-virus itself or by opportunistic infections. Reports of myocardial infarction in young HIV-infected patients, who received protease inhibitors, have raised concerns about premature arteriosclerosis and coronary artery disease in this population. In the pre-protease inhibitor era, autopsy reports were the first to describe an association between coronary artery disease and HIV infection. Long-term antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors, significantly reduced mortality, morbidity and revolutionized the care of HIV-infected patients. However, class-specific metabolic side effects, such as elevated total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and insulin resistance, have been described. These metabolic alterations of antiretroviral therapy impair the cardiovascular risk profile of HIV-infected patients. Even epidemiological studies found no significant effect of antiretroviral treatment type on coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction, an increase of arteriosclerosis in HIV-infected patients is suspected. Recent results of autopsy studies and analyses of endothelial function in patients with HIV infection described an effect of HIV and antiretroviral therapy on premature arteriosclerosis. The present article gives an overview about arteriosclerosis and coronary events in HIV-infected patients and the impact of antiretroviral therapy."

Although the incidence of certain forms of neuropathy is increased in HIV infection, in other cases, the association may be fortuitous. Different forms of peripheral neuropathy occur with increased frequency at particular stages of HIV disease. For example, inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (IDP) is often the first manifestation of HIV disease, when CD4 lymphocyte counts are relatively high. As immunosuppression progresses and HIV viral load becomes uncontrolled, the incidence of distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSP) increases. In advanced stages of HIV disease (CD4 count <50 cells/mm(3)), patients may develop opportunistic cytomegalovirus (CMV) nerve infection, which can present as progressive polyradiculopathy (PP) or mononeuropathy multiplex (MM). In addition to the neuromuscular disorders caused by HIV and its concomitant immunosuppression, the use of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and other therapeutic agents in HIV disease is frequently limited by neuromuscular side effects. This paper will review the symmetrical forms of polyneuropathy that occur in association with HIV infection and nucleoside analogue therapy. The clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic features of these disorders will be described along with a discussion of theories of pathogenesis and results of treatment to date."

HBV is a small, partially double-stranded DNA virus with four overlapping genes and a unique life cycle, creating an intracellular pool of covalently closed circular DNA molecules for persistence and an RNA template for replication via reverse transcription. Mutations occur frequently, and particular selection pressures, both endogenous (host immune clearance) and exogenous (vaccines and antivirals), readily select escape mutants. For example, HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection with either basal core promoter or precore mutations is predominant in many parts of the world. Therapy of HBV infection with the nucleoside analogue lamivudine frequently leads to the selection of drug-resistant strains with polymerase mutations. Treatment options for chronic HBV infection include at present either interferon-alpha or the oral nucleos(t)ide analogues lamivudine or adefovir. However, these drugs have drawbacks, including possible serious side effects and low response rates in HBeAg-negative patients in the case of interferon or recurrence of viremia after cessation of therapy and development of escape mutants after a long period of treatment with nucleoside inhibitors. Recent advances of in vitro and in vivo models allow to study new antiviral strategies, including novel nucleoside analogues, nucleocapsid inhibitors or small interfering RNA. This review summarises the impact of clinically relevant mutations in the HBV genome on viral replication and drug sensitivity, the current status of therapy and promising future perspectives on novel drug regimens."

Patients were randomized to receive blinded treatments with one of five weight-adjusted, twice-daily regimens of didanosine and stavudine (100 + 10 mg, 100 + 20 mg, 100 + 40 mg, 200 + 20 mg, and 200 + 40 mg) for up to 1 year. Dosages were adjusted appropriately for patients weighing <60 kg and reduced in response to adverse effects. No clear dose-related differences among treatment groups were detected with regard to suppression of plasma HIV RNA level or reduction in infectious titers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), improvement in CD4 count, or adverse effects. However, trends toward greater decreases in viral load and increases in CD4 count were detected when treatment groups containing the full recommended dosage of one or both agents (high-dose subgroup; arms 3, 4, and 5) were compared with the groups receiving lower dosages. At 28 weeks the mean log 10 HIV RNA decrease was 1.12 (n = 52) and at 52 weeks it was 0.97 (n = 32). Combination therapy was well tolerated, with no apparent dose-related adverse effects. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 2 of 86 (2.3%) of patients. Didanosine and stavudine together appear to be a good nucleoside analogue foundation for aggressive triple- or quadruple-drug therapy. Full therapeutic doses of each of these two agents should be used to achieve optimal suppression of HIV replication."

Insulin resistance (IR) was associated with CI in the early cART era, when antiretroviral medications had greater mitochondrial and metabolic toxicity. We sought to examine these relationships in the current cART era of reduced antiretroviral toxicities. This study examined IR among non-diabetics in relation to a 1-h neuropsychological test battery among 994 women (659 HIV-infected and 335 HIV-uninfected controls) assessed between 2009 and 2011. The mean (standard deviation (SD)) age of the sample was 45.1 (9.3) years. The HIV-infected sample had a median interquartile range (IQR) cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T-lymphocyte count of 502 (310-727) cells/μL, and 54 % had undetectable plasma HIV RNA levels. Among all, the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of IR ranged from 0.25 to 37.14. In adjusted models, increasing HOMA was significantly associated with reduced performance on Letter-Number Sequencing (LNS) attention task (β = -0.10, p < 0.01) and on Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) recognition (β = -0.10, p < 0.01) with weaker but statistically significant associations on phonemic fluency (β = -0.09, p = 0.01). An HIV*HOMA interaction effect was identified on the LNS attention task and Stroop trials 1 and 2, with worse performance in HIV-infected vs. HIV-uninfected women. In separate analyses, cohort members who had diabetes mellitus (DM) performed worse on the grooved pegboard test of psychomotor speed and manual dexterity. These findings confirm associations between both IR and DM on some neuropsychological tests and identify an interaction between HIV status and IR."
594,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Since the first reports between the association of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and neoplasia, there has been a dramatic change in the incidence and epidemiology of AIDS-related malignancies. Kaposi sarcoma (KS), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), and cervical cancer are classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as AIDS-defining malignancies. However, since the availability of highly active combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), especially protease inhibitors, there has been a steady increase in non- AIDS defining malignancies, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), lung cancer, hepatocellular cancer, anal cancer and others and a decline in AIDS-defining neoplasias. Although the emergence of non-AIDS defining cancers could be a result of longer life expectancy and due to a better control of HIV, toxic habits and co-infection with other viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papilloma virus (HPV) could play an important role. The interactions of cART and incomplete immune reconstitution could be other factors explaining the increase in non-AIDS defining cancers. These emerging non-AIDS defining malignancies present a new challenge in the care of patients with HIV infection, and require optimal treatment protocols that take into consideration the interaction between cART and systemic chemotherapy. We review the current status of AIDS-related malignancies, its pathophysiology, epidemiology and management with emphasis in the changing patterns of presentation."
15809,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Tuberculosis (TB) has been the most common opportunistic infection and cause of mortality among HIV-infected patients, especially in resource-limited countries. Clinical manifestations of TB vary and depend on the degree of immunodeficiency. Sputum microscopy and culture with drug-susceptibility testing are recommended as a standard method for diagnosing active TB. TB-related mortality in HIV-infected patients is high especially during the first few months of treatment. Integrated therapy of both HIV and TB is feasible and efficient to control the diseases and yield better survival. Randomized clinical trials have shown that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) improves survival of HIV-infected patients with TB. A delay in initiating ART is common among patients referred from TB to HIV separate clinics and this delay may be associated with increased mortality risk. Integration of care for both HIV and TB using a single facility and a single healthcare provider to deliver care for both diseases is a successful model. For TB treatment, HIV-infected patients should receive at least the same regimens and duration of TB treatment as HIV-uninfected patients. Currently, a 2-month initial intensive phase of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by 4 months of continuation phase of isoniazid and rifampin is considered as the standard treatment of drug-susceptible TB. ART should be initiated in all HIV-infected patients with TB, irrespective of CD4 cell count. The optimal timing to initiate ART is within the first 8 weeks of starting antituberculous treatment and within the first 2 weeks for patients who have CD4 cell counts <50 cells/mm(3). Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART remains a first-line regimen for HIV-infected patients with TB in resource-limited settings. Although a standard dose of both efavirenz and nevirapine can be used, efavirenz is preferred because of more favorable treatment outcomes. In the settings where raltegravir is accessible, doubling the dose to 800 mg twice daily is recommended. Adverse reactions to either antituberculous or antiretroviral drugs, as well as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, are common in patients receiving integrated therapy. Early recognition and appropriate management of these consequences can reinforce the successful integrated therapy in HIV-infected patients with TB. "

The effect of HIV on presentation, treatment, and outcomes of NHL and HL in routine care in the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) merits further characterization. We performed a retrospective analysis of HIV-infected patients with NHL and HL receiving care at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from January 1, 2000 until December 31, 2010. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc). Sixty-five HIV-infected patients with NHL and HL were identified. Patients with non-CNS NHL and HL presented with advanced disease (85% stage III or IV) and adverse prognostic features. Patients completed 87% of planned chemotherapy cycles, and 68% of patients completed stage-appropriate therapy. Dose reduction, interruption, and/or delay occurred during more than 25% of administered cycles in 64% of patients. Infectious complications, febrile neutropenia, and myelosuppression accounted for 78% of deviations from planned cumulative dose and dose intensity. Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) was associated with poor prognosis, but 2-year overall survival was 66% for all non-CNS lymphoma. Among patients surviving at least 2 years, 75% had CD4 count >200 cells/μl and 79% had HIV viral load <400 copies/ml at last follow-up. Despite advanced disease and difficulty tolerating chemotherapy with optimal cumulative dose and dose intensity, most patients with non-CNS HIV-associated lymphoma survived more than 2 years after diagnosis, the majority with suppressed HIV RNA."

The relationship between their immunological and clinical status and the prevalence of STDs was assessed and compared with that of 88 HIV-seronegative patients. Hepatitis B virus and Treponema pallidum were the most frequently occurring pathogens in both HIV-1-infected and HIV-seronegative patients. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was also observed in both groups, but no HIV-seronegative patient was infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). The Centers for Disease Control clinical staging of A1 through C3, representing asymptomatic to severe AIDS conditions, was observed in HIV-1 patients with or without STDs. A mean CD4 count of 288 cells per microliter (95% CI of 237-340 cells per microliter) in HIV-1 patients was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that in HIV-seronegative individuals with 1019 cells per microliter (95% CI of 924-1115 cells per microliter), irrespective of whether subjects in either group had previous or current STDs. The mean CD4 count of patients with a single infection from HIV-1 was not significantly different (P = 0.36) from that of HIV-1 patients with multiple infections. HIV-1 infection alone appears to be responsible for the marked immunodeficiency status of seropositive patients observed in this study."
1473,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic features of 77 consecutive HIV-infected non-European Union immigrants were compared according to gender. Immigrants (from Sub-Saharan Africa in around 60% of cases) represented 7.9% of our patient cohort at the end of 2002. Compared with male patients, females were more numerous, significantly younger (p.0001), and experienced sexual exposure versus drug addiction (p.02), while no difference was observed according to place of origin. A negative HIV serology preceding immigration was available for five women and four males only, while HIV disease was known before migration in 14 men versus 7 women (p.04). The tendency towards a shorter known history of HIV infection (p.05) of females versus males may be responsible for a lower incidence of AIDS among women (p.02). The use of antiretroviral treatment was matched by time and selected regimens, but compliance proved significantly greater in females versus males (p.0001), and women had less need of a regimen switch due to poor tolerability or refusal (73.2% versus 61.1%); the latter could be responsible for a greater mean CD4+ count (p.02), and lower mean plasma viremia (p.0001), although no difference was found when considering viral suppression rate (70.7% among women, 52.8% among men). Surveillance studies and prospective therapeutic trials are strongly warranted, in order to have a reliable assessment of HIV-infected immigrated people, to check the efficacy of preventive measures, obtain validated data about the clinical, virologic, and immunological evolution and outcome of HIV infection undergoing HAART, and to evaluate the frequency and role of eventual untoward effects of pharmacologic treatment."

Male and female patients with serological evidence of HBV infection (HBsAg and/or HBeAg positive patients) and abnormal liver histology were monitored for six months to confirm chronicity. At the end of the six months screening period eligible patient were enrolled into the study and treated with rIFN 4.5 MIU given three times a week for 6 months. Efficacy was assessed primarily by loss of HBV-DNA and/or HBeAg from serum and secondarily by loss of HBsAg and normalization of the liver histology. Safety was assessed by monitoring the leukocyte and platelet count over the treatment period whilst tolerability was assessed by recording the occurrence of adverse events (adverse drug reaction and intercurrent illness). At the end of therapy the response rate with respect to loss of HBV-DNA was 67% and 100% for HBeAg (i.e. for the six patients who were HBeAg positive at baseline). There was loss of HBsAg in 22.2% of the patients. A significant reduction in inflammation and necrosis scores was found among the 10 patients who had both baseline and term biopsies. The frequency of occurrence of adverse events was 53.8% and the laboratory safety parameters were not significantly affected by therapy (p > 0.05). 19.2% of the enrolled patients were withdrawn from the study prematurely. These results demonstrate that rIFN is effective in the management of CHB infection even in Nigerians. The high success rate associated with HBcAg clearance is particularly noteworthy.

In all, 34 HIV-1-infected patients were randomized to receive ATV for 12 weeks in doses chosen to achieve one of three serum trough levels: 5 to 13 microM, 14 to 22 microM, or 23 to 31 microM. Rash was the most common adverse event, with a grade 3 or 4 rash occurring in 4 patients. No significant change from baseline in HIV-1 plasma RNA mean copy number was detected at week 4 (+0.09 log10 copies/ml; p = .30). However, some evidence indicated moderate antiviral activity at week 4, based on median changes in CD4 count (+23/mm3; p = .05), and viral peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) titer (-0.68 log10) copies/ml; p = .03). In addition, 2 of 4 patients with detectable baseline serum p24 antigen showed declines of >50%. HIV-1 resistance to ATV was detected in 41% of patients and was most commonly associated with RT mutations K103N and Y181C. In contrast, the Y181C mutation was not detected in ATV-resistant isolates obtained from patients enrolled in ACTG 199, a study of ATV given in combination with zidovudine. Under the conditions of this study, ATV failed to demonstrate significant antiretroviral activity. However, transient in vivo activity might have been obscured by rapid development of resistance coupled with inadequate sampling at early time points following initiation of ATV therapy."
3326,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"We assessed the safety profile, tolerability, and antiviral effect of 12 weeks of triple combination therapy with stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), and nelfinavir in patients who had not previously received therapy with d4T, ddI, or a protease inhibitor. We also assessed the effect of the buffered tablet formulation of ddI on the pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir. The study had a single-arm, open-label design and enrolled patients aged > or =18 years who had HIV infection and > or =10,000 plasma HIV RNA copies/mL. Patients received the full recommended doses of oral d4T, ddI, and nelfinavir. Efficacy was assessed in terms of change from baseline in plasma HIV RNA and CD4+ cell counts, as well as in terms of the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA levels <400 copies/mL. The first 10 patients enrolled in the study were included in a substudy to determine the effects of the buffered tablet formulation of ddI on the pharmacokinetic profile of nelfinavir. A dose of ddI was given 1 hour before nelfinavir, after which the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of nelfinavir were determined. A total of 22 patients entered the trial, of whom 1 (5%) had AIDS, 12 (55%) had symptomatic HIV infection, and 9 (41%) were asymptomatic. The median baseline CD4+ cell count was 315 cells/microL (range, 70-709 cells/microL), and the median plasma viral load was 4.8 log10 copies/mL (range, 4.0-5.6 log10 copies/mL). ddI had no clinically significant effects on the plasma pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir. At the end of 12 weeks of treatment, the mean (+/- SE) decrease in plasma viral load was 1.36+/-0.24 log10 copies/mL, and 8 of 16 patients (50%) achieved plasma HIV RNA levels <400 copies/mL; the mean (+/- SE) increase in CD4+ cell count was 111.4+/-31.7 cells/microL. Patients who were judged to be compliant with antiretroviral therapy (ie, who missed <7 days of all 3 study drugs during 12 weeks of treatment) experienced mean decreases in viral load exceeding 2.0 log10 copies/mL, and 6 of 7 patients achieved HIV RNA levels <400 copies/mL after 12 weeks of therapy. Although 95% of patients reported an adverse event of grade 1 or higher, only 1 patient experienced a grade 3 or 4 adverse event (maculopapular rash) related to nelfinavir. As reflected in the Cmax, Tmax, and AUC, administration of ddI 1 hour before nelfinavir did not influence the pharmacokinetic profile of the protease inhibitor. Triple drug therapy with d4T, ddI, and nelfinavir was well tolerated and associated with few clinically significant toxicities. This treatment resulted in substantial reductions in viral load and improvements in CD4+ cell count over 12 weeks."

This study was designed to investigate whether in Category IV HIV infected patients (CDC, Atlanta, USA) these phenotypic changes were related to changes in the genetic strain of the organism. Isolates of C. albicans were obtained from 45 patients with HIV infection during the progression of their disease as determined by percentage T4 lymphocyte count. Isolates were strain differentiated using two methods. In 67 per cent of the patients a single strain of C. albicans, as determined by the DNA analysis, was isolated from each individual over the experimental period. The phenotypic expression of the genetically identical strains isolated from each patient varied considerably over the experimental period with the morphotype 754 being predominant. These results showed that the genotype of C. albicans isolated persisted in the majority of HIV infected individuals, but that the phenotypical expression of this strain changed. A finding in this study was that 18 strains of C. albicans had DNA which did not hybridize to the probe used. These strains were analysed for the presence of two other C. albicans specific DNA segments using PCR. The probe 27A hybridizing strains yielded PCR products which differed from the non-hybridizing strains. Five of these genetically atypical C. albicans strains and 98 of the C. albicans strains were then analysed for purported virulence factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In the present study, the overall and occult HBV infection prevalence rates were determined in a large population of non-injecting drug users in the Central-West region of Brazil. HBV genotypes and predictors of infection were also identified. A total of 852 individuals in 34 drug treatment centers were interviewed, and their serum samples were tested for the presence of HBV markers by ELISA. HBsAg and anti-HBc-positive samples were tested for HBV DNA by PCR. Samples with HBV DNA were genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The overall prevalence of HBV infection was 14% (95% CI: 11.7-16.5). A multivariate analysis of risk factors showed that age >30 years, non-white race/ethnicity, duration of drug use >10 years, lifetime number of sexual partners >10, non-use of condoms, and HCV and HIV status were associated significantly with HBV infection. Of the 9 (1%) HBsAg-reactive samples, HBV DNA was present in 2/2 of HBeAg-positive and in 5/7 anti-HBe-positive samples. An occult HBV infection rate of 2.7% (3/110) was found among anti-HBc-positive individuals. All HBV DNA-positive samples were genotyped: seven were genotype A, two were genotype D, and one was genotype F. Finally, few individuals (8%) had serological evidence of a previous HBV vaccination. These findings indicate that preventive interventions are needed for both sexual and drug-related high-risk behavior. Additionally, non-injecting drug users should be targeted for HBV vaccination."
11007,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"We have examined cell-free viral populations in the blood plasma and seminal plasma compartments of men infected with subtype C human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) using the V3-specific heteroduplex tracking assay (V3-HTA). We studied two cohorts of subjects who had visited either a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic for genital tract inflammation in the form of urethritis (n = 43) or a dermatology clinic (controls, n = 14) in Malawi. We have previously shown that the presence of urethritis is associated with an eightfold increase in virus load in the seminal plasma compartment (M. S. Cohen et al., Lancet 349:1868-1873, 1997). The purpose of this study was to determine whether genital tract inflammation and its treatment caused genetic instability in cell-free HIV-1 populations. In a cross-sectional analysis at study entry, three-fourths of the STD and control subjects had multiple V3 populations in their blood while 60% of the STD subjects and 79% of the control subjects had multiple V3 populations in their semen. Overall, one-fourth of all of the subjects showed discordance between results with blood and semen specimens when samples were compared for the presence and absence of subpopulations. When differences in the relative levels of abundance of bands were also taken into account, two-fifths of all of the subjects showed discordance between the compartments. Among the subset of subjects in whom multiple virus populations could be detected, half showed discordance between the compartments. There were no differences between STD and control cohorts for these comparisons of the compartments in this cross-sectional analysis at study entry. Longitudinal analysis of the viral populations from two separate clinic visits over 1 to 4 weeks showed that the complexity of each V3 population as measured by Shannon entropy was different in blood and semen at the two time points, indicating that the blood and semen constitute different compartments for HIV-1. The seminal plasma compartment was more dynamic than the blood plasma compartment for the STD subjects who were treated for urethritis, with changes being noted in the presence or absence of V3-HTA bands in the semen of 29% of these subjects but in the blood of only 9% of these subjects. However, the changes were generally small. Overall, our results suggest that 40% of male subjects show discordance between seminal and blood viral populations and that the complexity of each V3 population was different between the two compartments. Both of these results point to the partial independence of the seminal compartment as a viral niche within the body."
7953,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"We evaluated the plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety of once-daily low-dose boosted saquinavir (SQVr; 1,200 of saquinavir [SQV] with 100 mg of ritonavir) plus two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors in treatment-naive or limited protease inhibitor (PI)-experienced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. A prospective study without entry restrictions on the plasma HIV-RNA (VL) or CD4 cell count was carried out. Plasma and intracellular SQV levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Efficacy was evaluated by an intention-to-treat analysis; treatment failure was defined as virological failure (a VL of >50 copies/ml after 24 weeks or a confirmed rebound to >50 copies/ml) or interruption for any reason. A total of 151 patients were included in the study (106 of them either had never received PI or had no previous virological failure on PIs) and could be characterized as follows: previous C3 stage, 28.9%; injection-drug users, 69.1%; subjects with chronic viral hepatitis, 53%; and subjects with cirrhosis, 10%. The median baseline CD4 level was 184/mul, and the median VL was 4.8 log(10) copies/ml. Median C(max), area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h, and C(min) plasma and intracellular SQV levels were 3,672 and 10,105 ng/ml, 34,283 and 99,535 ng.h/ml, and 359 and 1,062 ng/ml, respectively. The efficacy as determined by intention to treat at 52 weeks was 69.7% (96% in the on-treatment analysis), with similar results regardless of the baseline VL and CD4 counts. Only five patients had virological failure despite adequate C(min) levels, but with a poor adherence (the only variable related to virological failure). Adverse events caused the withdrawal of the treatment in four patients (2.6%). In conclusion, given the pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy, and tolerability of this regimen, once-daily low-dose SQVr may be considered a treatment option in treatment-naive or limited PI-experienced HIV-infected patients, with the additional benefit of being currently the least-expensive PI-based regimen available."

In South Africa, with the highest number of HIV infections worldwide, HIV-1 subtype C is prevalent, while HIV-1 subtype B (genetically different from C) prevails in Europe and the United States. We aimed to evaluate if HIV infection (subtype C) is associated with dyslipidemia, inflammation and the occurrence of the MetS in Africans. Three hundred newly diagnosed HIV-infected participants were compared to 300 age, gender, body mass index and locality matched uninfected controls. MetS was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria. The HIV-infected group showed lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.23 vs. 1.70 mmol/L) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (2.60 vs. 2.80 mmol/L) and higher triglycerides (1.29 vs. 1.15 mmol/L), C-reactive protein (3.31 vs. 2.13 mg/L) and interleukin 6 (4.70 vs. 3.72 pg/L) levels compared to the uninfected group. No difference in the prevalence of the MetS was seen between the two groups (ATP III, 15.2 vs. 11.5%; IDF, 21.1 vs. 22.6%). This study shows that HIV-1 subtype C is associated with dyslipidemia, but not with a higher incidence of MetS in never antiretroviral-treated HIV-infected Africans."

Clevudine is a new pyrimidine analog with potent anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) activity in vitro. A multicenter dose-escalation study evaluated clevudine at 10, 50, 100, and 200 mg once daily for 28 days. Eligible patients had HBV DNA levels of 3 x 10(6) copies/mL or more, had not undergone nucleoside treatment, and were without human immunodeficiency or hepatitis C virus coinfection. Thirty-two patients were enrolled (5, 10, 10, and 7 patients in the 10-, 50-, 100-, and 200-mg dose groups, respectively), 81% were male, 81% Asian, and 88% were hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) positive at baseline. Median pretreatment serum HBV DNA levels ranged from 7.3 to 8.8 log(10) copies/mL. After 28 days, the median HBV DNA log(10) change from baseline was -2.5, -2.7, -3.0, and -2.6 log(10). Six months after dosing, median changes from baseline were -1.2, -1.4, -2.7 and -1.7 log(10) in the 10-, 50-, 100-, and 200-mg cohorts, respectively. Six of 27 patients lost HBeAg, and 3 of 27 patients seroconverted to HBe antibody. Clevudine was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities. A transient increase in alanine aminotransferase of up to 7.8 times the upper limit of normal (increase ranged from 20 to 186 IU/L) was observed in six patients in the 100-mg cohort, without signs of liver failure. These increases were associated with improved viral suppression. The pharmacokinetic profile of clevudine was proportional to the dose. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the tolerability and potent activity of clevudine in HBV-infected patients and support further clinical study."

Raltegravir also provided clinicians with additional options for first-line therapy and for the simplification of regimens in patients with stable virological suppression. Two additional INIs in advanced clinical development-elvitegravir and S/GSK1349572-may prove equally versatile. However, the INIs have a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance in that 1 or 2 mutations are capable of causing marked reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir and elvitegravir, the most well-studied INIs. This perspective reviews the genetic mechanisms of INI resistance and their implications for initial INI therapy, the treatment of antiretroviral-experienced patients, and regimen simplification."

We examined the roles of natural selection, population growth, random genetic drift, and recombination in shaping the variation in 1509 C2-V5 env sequences derived from nine men with chronic HIV-1 infection. These sequences were obtained from clinical visits that reflect the first 6-13.7 years of infection. Pairwise comparisons of nonsynonymous and synonymous distances, Tajima's D test, Fu and Li's D* test, and a test of recurrent mutation revealed evidence for episodes of nonneutral evolution in a total of 22 out of 145 blood samples, representing six of the nine individuals. Using three coalescent-based maximum-likelihood estimators, we found viral effective population sizes in all nine individuals to be approximately 10(3). We also show that a previous estimate of the effective population size of approximately 10(5) based on rare haplotype frequencies decreases to approximately 10(3) upon correcting a biased sampling procedure. We conclude that the genetic variation in these data sets can be explained by a predominance of random genetic drift of neutral mutations with brief episodes of natural selection that were frequently masked by recombination."

Preventive HBV vaccination is less effective in HIV-infected patients than in those without HIV infection. Emtricitabine, lamivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir) each have activity against HIV and HBV. In HBV/HIV-coinfected patients, if HBV or HIV treatment is needed, it should be initiated with tenofovir and emtricitabine or tenofovir and lamivudine as the nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone of a fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen. If HBV treatment is needed and tenofovir cannot be used safely, entecavir is recommended in addition to a fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen. Initiation of treatment for HBV infection is based on the presence of cirrhosis and on HBV DNA level, alanine aminotransferase level, and biopsy results. Current HBV treatments are associated with low functional cure rates. This article summarizes a presentation by Kenneth E.

19993,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, with superior efficacy and safety compared to interferon-based therapies. Despite these improvements, drug interactions with DAAs exist and may be clinically relevant in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-coinfected patients. We present a case of nephrotoxicity associated with concomitant use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and ledipasvir-sofosbuvir (LDV-SOF). A 56-year-old woman with HIV infection who had been taking efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine (EFV/TDF/FTC) for 6 years developed acute kidney injury 8 weeks after initiating LDV-SOF for the treatment of HCV infection. Her serum creatinine concentration peaked at 10 mg/dL, compared with her baseline concentration of 0.9-1 mg/dL. Kidney biopsy revealed acute tubular necrosis and acute interstitial nephritis. Both LDV-SOF and TDF were discontinued, and the patient's serum creatinine concentration decreased to 1.3 mg/dL over the following 6 weeks. We postulate that this adverse drug reaction may have been secondary to the known interaction between ledipasvir and TDF, which results in increased TDF exposure. Despite knowledge of this interaction, LDV-SOF is commonly prescribed in patients with HIV-HCV coinfection, as patients who received LDV-SOF- and TDF-containing regimens in trials have not demonstrated adverse clinical consequences related to this interaction. This case highlights the rare but potentially serious nephrotoxicity that can result from TDF toxicity and serves as a reminder to clinicians to implement close renal function monitoring in patients receiving both LDV-SOF and TDF. Clinicians prescribing LDV-SOF to HCV-HIV-coinfected patients receiving TDF should be cautious about use with concomitant nephrotoxic medications and monitor markers of tubular dysfunction, including urinary phosphorus excretion, and renal injury at baseline and week 4 of therapy. Tenofovir alafenamide and alternative DAAs may also have a role in the management of patients at high risk for renal adverse effects from TDF."

However, we recently demonstrated that monotherapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) for 48 weeks displayed noninferior efficacy to TDF plus entecavir (ETV) combination therapy in patients with HBV resistant to multiple drugs, including ETV and adefovir. Nonetheless, whether prolonged TDF monotherapy would be safe and increase the virologic response rate in these patients was unclear. Among 192 patients with HBV-resistance mutations to ETV and/or adefovir, who were randomized to receive TDF monotherapy (n = 95) or TDF/ETV combination therapy (n = 97) for 48 weeks, 189 agreed to continue TDF monotherapy (TDF-TDF group) or to switch to TDF monotherapy (TDF/ETV-TDF group) and 180 (93.8%) completed the 144-week study. Serum HBV DNA <15 IU/mL at week 48, the primary efficacy endpoint, was achieved in 66.3% in the TDF-TDF group and 68.0% in the TDF/ETV-TDF group (P = 0.80). At week 144, the proportion with HBV DNA <15 IU/mL increased to 74.5%, which was significantly higher compared with that at week 48 (P = 0.03), without a significant difference between groups (P = 0.46). By on-treatment analysis, a total of 79.4% had HBV DNA <15 IU/mL at week 144. Transient virologic breakthrough occurred in 6 patients, which was due to poor drug adherence. At week 144, 19 patients who had HBV DNA levels >60 IU/mL qualified for genotypic resistance analysis, and 6 retained some of their baseline resistance mutations of HBV. No patients developed additional resistance mutations throughout the study period."

Recent studies suggest that ongoing chronic liver inflammation is responsible for the liver injury in HCV-infected patients. We aimed to determine whether HIV-1 coinfection altered intrahepatic inflammatory profiles in HCV infection, thereby hastening liver damage. We used a real-time RT-PCR-based array to comparatively analyze intrahepatic inflammation gene profiles in liver biopsy specimens from HCV-infected (n = 16), HCV/HIV-1-coinfected (n = 8) and uninfected (n = 8) individuals. We then used human hepatocytes to study the molecular mechanisms underlying alternations of the inflammatory profiles. Compared with uninfected individuals, HCV infection and HCV/HIV-1 coinfection markedly altered expression of 59.5% and 50.0% of 84 inflammation-related genes tested, respectively. Among these genes affected, HCV infection up-regulated the expression of 24 genes and down-regulated the expression of 26 genes, whereas HCV/HIV-1 coinfection up-regulated the expression of 21 genes and down-regulated the expression of 21 genes. Compared with HCV infection, HCV/HIV-1 coinfection did not dramatically affect intrahepatic gene expression profiles of cytokines and their receptors, but profoundly altered expression of several chemokine genes including up-regulation of the CXCR3-associated chemokines. Human hepatocytes produced these chemokines in response to virus-related microbial translocation, viral protein stimulation, and antiviral immune responses."

Patients included had abnormal alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, detectable HCV RNA, and an interpretable liver biopsy. Demographic, epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, histological, and therapeutic data were recorded in all patients. We also registered the clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis (previous to biopsy) and whether the biopsy result deferred the decision of initiating therapy. During the 33-month duration of the study, 112 patients were included. The degree of fibrosis in liver biopsies was none or mild (F0 or F1) in 47 patients (42%) and was significant or severe in 65 (58%). Seventeen patients (15%) had histological cirrhosis. By logistic regression analysis, only portal hypertension (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 5.3 [1.05-25.9], P = 0.04) was independently associated with significant fibrosis. Overall, cirrhosis was predicted before biopsy in 29 patients (26%) by the caregiving physician, but only 8 of these were confirmed histologically. The clinical prediction of cirrhosis before biopsy had a sensitivity of 47%, a specificity of 78%, a positive predictive value of 28%, and a negative predictive value of 89%. Histological findings changed the decision to initiate HCV therapy in 19 patients (17%) because of little or no fibrosis. Liver biopsy is a useful tool in the management of HCV-HIV-coinfected persons. In addition to allowing grading and staging of the disease far better than any other method or combination of methods, it is important for making management decisions for patients coinfected with HCV and HIV."

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, a congender of adefovir that is used in the treatment of HIV infected patients, has recently been shown to also be effective in patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV infection. We therefore compared the two substances in a study of 53 patients defined by high HBV DNA (>6 log10 copies/mL) levels and genotypic evidence of lamivudine resistance. Thirty-five patients received tenofovir for 72 to 130 weeks, and 18 received adefovir for 60 to 80 weeks. Changes in HBV DNA levels were followed for the complete period of 48 weeks. Early viral kinetics were compared on matched subgroups of 5 patients each. Individually, all tenofovir-treated patients showed a strong and early suppression of HBV DNA within a few weeks whether they were coinfected with HIV or were without comorbidity. In contrast, considerable individual variations in HBV DNA decline were observed in the adefovir group. Thus at week 48, only 44% of these patients had HBV DNA levels below 10(5) copies/mL in contrast to 100% of the tenofovir-treated patients (P = .001). No severe side effects were noticed in either group. No evidence of phenotypic viral resistance could be demonstrated in the tenofovir-treated patients in the long term (up to 130 weeks). In conclusion, tenofovir may become an effective alternative for the treatment of patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV infection."

Immunologic evaluation revealed decreased serum IgG and IgA, increased IgM, depressed T- and B-lymphocyte functions, and decreased natural killer (NK) activity for herpes simplex-type I virus-infected targets. NK activity was augmented following exposure of the patient's lymphocytes to interferon (IF) in vitro. The child was treated with interferon (four courses, dosage varying from 2 million U/day to 1 million U three times/week for periods of 10, 28, 80, and 67 days, respectively, interspersed over 9 months) and hyperimmune plasma infusions every 3 weeks. Toward the end of interferon therapy oral Levamisole was started and a feeding gastrostomy was inserted to provide nutritional support. Clinical recovery was associated with reversal of immunologic abnormalities except for the hypogammaglobulinemia. Aggressive antiviral therapy (e.g., with IF) followed by immunostimulation (e.g., with Levamisole) may prove effective in controlling certain viral infections in immunodeficiency disorders."

We assessed the prevalence and clinical significance of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in chronically-infected therapy-naïve patients enrolled in a multi-center cohort in North America. Pre-therapy clinical significance was quantified by plasma viral load (pVL) and CD4+ cell count (CD4) at baseline. Naïve bulk sequences of HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) were screened for resistance mutations as defined by the World Health Organization surveillance list. The overall prevalence of TDR was 14.2%. We used a Bayesian network to identify co-transmission of TDR mutations in clusters associated with specific drugs or drug classes. Aggregate effects of mutations by drug class were estimated by fitting linear models of pVL and CD4 on weighted sums over TDR mutations according to the Stanford HIV Database algorithm. Transmitted resistance to both classes of reverse transcriptase inhibitors was significantly associated with lower CD4, but had opposing effects on pVL. In contrast, position-specific analyses of TDR mutations revealed substantial effects on CD4 and pVL at several residue positions that were being masked in the aggregate analyses, and significant interaction effects as well. Residue positions in RT with predominant effects on CD4 or pVL (D67 and M184) were re-evaluated in causal models using an inverse probability-weighting scheme to address the problem of confounding by other mutations and demographic or risk factors. We found that causal effect estimates of mutations M184V/I (-1.7 log₁₀pVL) and D67N/G (-2.1[³√CD4] and 0.4 log₁₀pVL) were compensated by K103N/S and K219Q/E/N/R. As TDR becomes an increasing dilemma in this modern era of highly-active antiretroviral therapy, these results have immediate significance for the clinical management of HIV-1 infections and our understanding of the ongoing adaptation of HIV-1 to human populations."

The reduction of HIV-1 RNA plasma levels in late-stage patients receiving protease inhibitors has been associated with increased concentrations of MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, RANTES and IL-16 and a decrease in levels of MCP-1. We determined plasma levels of MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, RANTES and IL-16 during the first 16 weeks of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in chronic HIV-1-infected patients. Patients were administered one of two therapeutic regimens based on either a protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). No differences were seen in the levels of RANTES and IL-16 over the first 16 weeks of HAART in either treatment group. MCP-1 decreased significantly in the PI-treated group over the first 16 weeks of HAART (P = 0.0003). A significant increase was observed in the levels of MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta in the NNRTI cohort (P = 0.0010 and P = 0.0012, respectively). A significant decrease in levels of MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta (P = 0.0015 and P = 0.0299, respectively) was observed over the 16 weeks in the PI cohort. A significant difference was seen when the levels of MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta were compared between the NNRTI and the PI cohorts at week 16 (P = 0.04 and P = 0.05, respectively). Evaluation of CCR5 expression ex vivo revealed no difference between the two treatment groups. Patients were genotyped for CCR5 Delta32 and the incidence of heterozygosity was lower than in the HIV-1 seronegative controls (3% compared to 19%)."

We reviewed 858 charts from our total HIV population to determine the prevalence and epidemiology of HIVAN at our center, and to evaluate the renal and patient survival among individual groups, according to race, sex and HIV risk factor. The prevalence of HIVAN was low (1.9%), relative to other centers (4-13%). Although Hispanics accounted for 56% of the HIV population, only 38% of HIVAN patients were Hispanic. The absolute risk of HIVAN in blacks was 3. 6%, and in Hispanics was 1.3%. The relative risk of blacks vs. Hispanics was 2.8% (p < 0.04). Women and men were represented equally in both the HIVAN and HIV populations. The mean (+/- SE) rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate was 3.7 +/- 0.9 ml/min/month, and patient survival following the onset of HIVAN was 23.6 +/- 4.8 months. We found no difference in renal or patient survival between individual groups. In summary, the risk of HIVAN in Hispanics is similar to that for whites. Male sex is not an independent risk factor. Both renal and patient survival are similar in blacks and Hispanics, and in men compared to women."

To investigate the infection prevalence of Mg, Mf, Mpe and Mpi among male HIV/AIDS patients in Jiangsu Province and to analyze the relationship between pathogenic mycoplasmas and cellular immune function of them. First void urine and venous blood samples were collected and epidemiology questionnaires were administered after informed consent. Nested PCR was performed to determine the infection of Mg, Mf, Mpe and Mpi while ELISA assay was applied to detect interleukin-2(IL-2), interferon-γ(IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α). SAS 9.0 software was applied to analyze the data. A total of 713 HIV/AIDS patients were recruited in this study. The overall infection rates of Mg, Mf, Mpe and Mpi are 27.9%, 9.7%, 1.0% and 18.4% respectively. Generally, the infection rates of Mg(χ(2) = 10.311, P = 0.006) and Mpi were declined as the CD4+ cell counts increased, while Mf infection was higher in CD4+ T cell>350/μl group. The levels of cytokines are different with the variance of mycoplasmas infection. Mycoplasma infection among male HIV/AIDS patients is associated with changes in cellular immune response (cytokines). However, the affect of mycoplasmas on the immune function is complex, further studies are still required to elucidate whether mycoplasmas interact with HIV by interfering host immune system. "

Of the patients included in the study, 56.3% were male and 43.7%, female. Patient age ranged from 18 to 69 years. Blood transfusion was the most frequent form of hepatitis C virus transmission, detected in 128 (30%) cases, and no risk factor was detected in 187 (43.9%) patients. Patient distribution regarding architectural changes observed in a liver biopsy was: grade 0 (14.1%); grade 1 (51.2%); grade 2 (20.6%); grade 3 (8%); grade 4 (6.1%). Multivariate analysis revealed a positive correlation between fibrosis severity and age greater than 40 years at the time of the liver biopsy, serum albumin levels below normal lower limits, gamma-glutamyltransferase levels equal to or higher than twice upper normal limits, platelet numbers less than 150,000/mm(3) and high necroinflammatory activity.

The present series includes 111 patients, all diagnosed and studied at one hospital in New York City. There were 108 men and three women; the average age was 39 years and male homosexuality was the predominant risk factor. The materials examined originated from 138 surgical specimens and 24 autopsies. There were 11 cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma and 100 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), a proportion strongly skewed in favor of the latter. Hodgkin's lymphoma in AIDS patients was characterized by advanced clinical stage, high histologic grade, and frequent bone marrow involvement. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in AIDS patients, in contrast to the general population, originated predominantly in extranodal locations (61 cases) versus locations in which the lymph nodes were the site of the primary tumors (39 cases). In the digestive tract, the unusual oral and anal primary locations were often noted and were possibly related to specific risk factors. There were 15 cases of NHL of the central nervous system, an incidence 14 times greater than that recorded in the general population. The majority of NHLs were of high histologic grade, Burkitt's and large cell immunoblastic, representing most of the cerebral and gastrointestinal tumors. All NHLs were of B-cell immunophenotype. Lymphadenopathies with the histologic features of human immunodeficiency virus infection, particularly of the late stage (type C), often preceded NHL. Probing for Epstein-Barr virus genome was more frequently positive in Hodgkin's lymphoma than in NHL. Immunologic evaluations showed severely depressed T cell counts and CD4 to CD8 cell ratios as well as markedly increased levels of antilymphocyte antibodies. Reflecting the background of profound immune deficiency, the AIDS-associated lymphomas were characterized by high aggressiveness, early tendency to generalization, frequent post-treatment relapse, and short periods of survival."

In this report, a chronic hepatitis B case who presented with a serologic profile mimicking acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and exhibiting transient autoantibody positivities because of the polyclonal activation of B cells due to EBV reactivation has been presented. The test results of 56 years old male patient who suffered from fatigue and pain on the right upper quadrant, revealed high levels of liver enzymes (AST: 187 U/L, ALT: 569 U/L), positivity of HBsAg, anti-HBc IgG and anti-HBe, and negativity of anti-HBc IgM, HBeAg and anti-HBs. Since HBV-DNA level was found 405,974 copies/mL by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the patient was taken into follow-up. At the 6th month AST and ALT levels further elevated (352 U/L and 609 U/L, respectively), and anti-HBc IgM and anti-HBs became positive in addition to the previous positive markers of HBV. With the suspicion of superinfection, further laboratory investigations yielded negative results in CMV-IgM and Paul Bunnel test, while positive results in EBV anti-VCA IgM and IgG, anti-EBNA IgM and IgG, anti-p22 IgM and IgG and anti-EA IgM. In the follow-up period high levels of autoantibody positivities [rheumatoid factor (42.200 U/ml), anti-nuclear antibody (1/100) and anti-Ro-52] together with increased levels of total IgG, IgM and IgA were detected. In the following months, the levels of transaminases, total immunoglobulins and HBV-DNA have distinctively decreased, and in the 20th month the previous HBV profile regained (HBsAg, anti-HBc IgG and anti-HBe positive, anti-HBc IgM and anti-HBs negative, HBV-DNA: 6984 copies/ml) and the other pathological test results returned to normal. As a result, ALT increases seen during the course of chronic hepatitis B should not always be considered as HBV manifestations and the unusual serologic patterns should be evaluated as a consequence of superinfection with various viral agents."

The semi-structured clinical interview (SCID-I) was used to assess MDD. Severity of depressive symptoms was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Of the total sample, 60 patients (34.9%) developed SCID-I defined MDD during antiviral treatment. The proportion of HCV mono- and HIV/HCV patients developing MDD during treatment was not significantly different (37.9% vs. 25%; p=0.185). In both groups, there was a significant increase in HAMD total score from baseline to week 4, and a significant decrease between week 24 and 6 months post-treatment cessation. The greatest increase was observed in the symptoms of the neurovegetative syndrome. HCV mono-infected patients reported higher scores than co-infected patients, particularly impaired activity and somatic symptoms, but the differences were only significant at week 12. The finding that co-infected patients appear less vulnerable to the development of depressive symptoms during HCV treatment than HCV mono-infected patients warrants further exploration, including a thorough analysis of the biological and psychosocial factors associated with this emergence."

To evaluate sexual dysfunction and the influence that different antiretrovirals could have on those parameters, we conducted a prospective study in patients with stable clinical condition attending an HIV outpatient clinic. A total of 351 evaluations were performed in 189 HIV-infected men, who were interviewed about symptoms of sexual dysfunction. Sexual hormones as well as other clinical and laboratory parameters were also measured at the time of each evaluation. The mean CD4 count was 451.1 x 10(6) cells/L, and viral load was undetectable in two thirds of the determinations. The prevalence of sexual dysfunction was 19.5% overall, but it was influenced by treatment, particularly (although not exclusively) by protease inhibitors (PIs) (27.1% vs. 3.8% for untreated patients). Sexual dysfunction was not related to hypophyseal or gonadal hormonal values. Although several parameters were associated with sexual dysfunction in the univariate analysis, only antiretroviral treatment was significantly predictive of this disorder in a logistic regression analysis. Sexual dysfunction is common in HIV-infected patients in stable clinical condition receiving HAART, and all antiretroviral drugs, particularly PIs, seem to be related to it. Sexual dysfunction in these patients is not related to hormonal causes."

We conducted a nested case-control study. All patients who disengaged from care (defined as being lost to follow-up for at least one year) from 2007 to 2014 inclusive were identified. Cases were matched to controls in a 1:4 ratio. A total of 1250 cases were included; 250/2289 (10.9%) of patients attending our HIV clinic disengaged from 2007 to 2014. One hundred and twenty-six (50.4%) were heterosexual, 81 (32.4%) were men who have sex with men and 40 (16%) were intravenous drug users. On univariate analysis only, patients with heterosexual risk were more likely to disengage from care (50.4% vs. 33.7%, p: <0.001). Those who disengaged were younger, mean age of 39 (p: <0.001). A higher proportion of patients who disengaged from care was not receiving ART and did not have a suppressed HIV-1 viral load (p: <0.001). On multivariable analysis, Irish patients were less likely to disengage from HIV care (odds ratio: 0.567, p: 0.002). Factors associated with non-retention in HIV care have been identified.

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which dramatically modifies the natural history of HIV disease, causes in a high proportion of patients a metabolic syndrome that includes body fat redistribution, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and insulin resistance. These effects are particularly evident in patients treated with protease inhibitors (PIs). However, studies on the cardiovascular risk among HIV-infected individuals receiving PIs have not shown a consistent association. The pathogenesis of the HAART-associated metabolic syndrome has not been completely elucidated, but there is growing evidence that a synergistic effect between PIs and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors might play a significant role. All HIV-infected patients candidate to antiretroviral therapy and patients already under treatment should undergo an assessment that includes the evaluation of the cardiovascular risk with the available guidelines."

The following results were obtained: 1) The proportion of the students who received information on HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) from school teachers in 1992 was higher than that in 1989 for both males and females. Similarly, for both males and females, the proportion of students with correct knowledge on HIV transmission was significantly higher in 1992. The proportion of the students who intended to have a friendship with a hypothetical HIV-infected classmate or close friend in 1992 was significantly higher. 2) The results of multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that such factors as having more correct knowledge on HIV transmission and considering the confidentiality of persons with HIV/AIDS were significantly related to having friendship with a hypothetical HIV-infected classmate for both 1989 and 1992; such factors as being a female and having an increasing risk of HIV infection were significantly related to the responses obtained for 1992."

As HIV-infected patients are aging, they are at increased risk for comorbid diseases. These non-AIDS related diseases account for a growing proportion of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in HIV-infected patients in recent studies. HIV-infected patients still present to the ICU with HIV-related conditions such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), but these conditions are becoming less common. Respiratory failure remains the most common indication for ICU admission. Immune reconstitution inflammatory response syndrome and toxicities related to HAART may also result in ICU admission. While ICU survival has improved since the earliest era of the HIV epidemic, hospital mortality for HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU remains around 30%. Risk factors for ICU mortality include poor functional status, weight loss, more than one year between HIV diagnosis and ICU admission, lower serum albumin, higher severity of illness, need for mechanical ventilation, and respiratory failure-particularly if due to PCP and accompanied by pneumothorax. The impact of HAART on ICU outcomes is unclear. HAART administration in the ICU can be challenging due to limited delivery routes, concern for viral resistance and medication toxicities. There are no data to determine the safety or efficacy of HAART initiation in the ICU. Future studies are needed to address the role of age, associated comorbidities and impact of HAART on outcomes of HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU."

We analyzed the frequency in adults and children of common HIV-related conditions and the relative risk of AIDS after occurrence of these conditions, controlling for age at seroconversion and the percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes. Thrombocytopenia was the most frequently observed condition with cumulative incidences of 43% +/- 7% in adults and 27% +/- 6% in children and adolescents by 10 years after seroconversion. Oral candidiasis, fever, weight loss, and non-AIDS pneumonia were two to four times more common in adults than children, whereas herpes zoster risk was similar in the two age groups. HIV-related conditions were infrequent during the first 4 years of infection, particularly in children. With the exception of thrombocytopenia, mean CD4 counts were less than 350 cells/microL at the onset of the conditions. The relative hazard of AIDS after oral candidiasis was 18 in children and 3.8 in adults. Relative hazard in adults was also increased after persistent fever (10), weight loss (3.2), and non-AIDS pneumonia (2.2). Herpes zoster and thrombocytopenia were not significantly associated with AIDS in either age group. We conclude that intermediate HIV-related conditions occur more frequently in adults than in children with hemophilia. Persistent fever is the strongest predictor of AIDS in adults, whereas oral candidiasis is the strongest predictor in children. These findings should facilitate the design and conduct of clinical trials as well as the management of HIV-infected children and adults."

For all patients, antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and HHV-8 lytic and latent antigens were evaluated.HHV-8 seroprevalence was higher among individuals recruited in the 1990s (31.6% for anti-lytic, 8.5% for anti-latent antibodies) compared with similar findings in those seen in the late 1980s (14.6% and 3.4% for anti-lytic and anti-latent antibodies, respectively), with a twofold increase of the risk of HHV-8 infection. However, the increase was observed only among injecting drug users, whereas seroprevalence tended to slightly increase among those infected by sexual contact. At univariate analysis, time of recruitment and being homosexual men were factors associated with HHV-8 infection, an association that remained after adjusting for age. HBV infection was significantly associated with HHV-8 infection (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.6), whereas those infected with HCV had a lower probability of having HHV-8 antibodies (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.20-0.6). After controlling for age and gender, time of recruitment remained independently associated with HHV-8 infection among injecting drug users. In conclusion, HHV-8 seroprevalence appears to be increased during 10 years among HIV-infected injection drug users but not among homosexual men, who remain those at the highest risk of infection."
16492,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The cerebral complement system is hypothesized to contribute to neurodegeneration in the pathogenesis of AIDS-associated neurological disorders. Our former results have shown that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strongly induces the synthesis of complement factor C3 in astrocytes. This upregulation explains in vivo data showing elevated complement levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with AIDS-associated neurological symptoms. Since inhibition of complement synthesis and activation in the brain may represent a putative therapeutic goal to prevent virus-induced damage, we analyzed in detail the mechanisms of HIV-induced modulation of C3 expression. HIV-1 increased the C3 levels in astrocyte culture supernatants from 30 to up to 400 ng/ml; signal transduction studies revealed that adenylate cyclase activation with upregulation of cyclic AMP is the central signaling pathway to mediate that increase. Furthermore, activity of protein kinase C is necessary for HIV induction of C3, since inhibition of protein kinase C by prolonged exposure to the phorbol ester tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate partly abolished the HIV effect. The cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and gamma interferon were not involved in mediating the HIV-induced C3 upregulation, since neutralizing antibodies had no effect. Besides whole HIV virions, the purified viral proteins Nef and gp41 are biologically active in upregulating C3, whereas Tat, gp120, and gp160 were not able to modulate C3 synthesis. Further experiments revealed that neurons were also able to respond on incubation with HIV with increased C3 synthesis, although the precise pattern was slightly different from that in astrocytes. This strengthens the hypothesis that HIV-induced complement synthesis represents an important mechanism for the pathogenesis of AIDS in the brain."

Of 163 patients (16%) with a history of herpes zoster at enrollment, 22 (13%) had a recurrence during the 2-year follow-up. For those without prior herpes zoster, the probability of its development was 6.3% at 1 and 8.8% at 2 years. Progression to AIDS was not associated with herpes zoster. By proportional hazards analysis, an initial occurrence of herpes zoster was associated with prolonged survival independent of baseline CD4 cell count and disease stage; however, recurrence tended to be associated with death. Thus, herpes zoster is relatively common in advanced HIV infection and its initial occurrence late in disease may indicate improved prognosis."
18329,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a challenging problem in Africa because of the burden of disease (especially human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-related AKI in sub-Saharan Africa, diarrheal disease, malaria, and nephrotoxins), late presentation of patients to health care facilities, and the lack of resources to support patients with established AKI in many countries. The pattern of AKI is vastly different from that in more developed countries. There are no reliable statistics about the incidence of AKI in Africa. Infections (malaria, HIV, diarrheal diseases, and others), nephrotoxins, and obstetric and surgical complications are the major etiologies in Africa. AKI in hospitalized antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive HIV-1-infected patients is associated with a 6-fold higher risk of in-hospital mortality. The most common risk factors are severe immunosuppression (CD4 count, <200 cells/mm(3)) and opportunistic infection. The most common causes are acute tubular necrosis and thrombotic microangiopathy. In the post-ART era, HIV-1-infected patients with AKI still have an increased risk of in-hospital mortality and these episodes of AKI seem more frequent in the first year of ART. Subsequently, survival is comparable in those with and without HIV infection. More resources are required to prevent AKI and to provide renal support for those patients requiring dialytic therapy."

Because human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease associates T cell activation and depletion, polyclonal B cell activation, atopic symptoms, drug hypersensitivity, and autoimmune activity, we have evaluated IgE, as well as IgA, IgG, and IgM, in 315 HIV-seropositive individuals with or without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and compared the results to those of 100 HIV-seronegative subjects. IgE levels were higher in HIV-infected subjects as a whole, compared to levels in seronegative control subjects (p less than 0.05). This difference was particularly marked between patients with AIDS and control subjects (p less than 0.005). A strong relationship appeared between IgE and the immune status as assessed by CD4 cell counts (p less than 0.001 between IgE values in patients with CD4 less than 300 or greater than 300/microliters). In addition, we assessed the predictive value of IgE elevation over disease progression: in subjects with a CD4 count less than 300/microliters, the survival analysis disclosed a 24-month occurrence rate of AIDS of 83% in individuals with IgE greater than 150 KIU/L versus 44% in individuals with IgE less than 150 (p = 0.016). In subjects with an AIDS-related complex, IgE greater than 150 indicated a 100% rate of AIDS versus 9% in individuals with IgE less than 150 (p = 0.003). Thus, IgE levels appear to be a very discriminative marker between patients in late stages of HIV infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The importance of HIV DNA and MCP1 SNP has been suggested to be independently important in progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and neurocognitive impairment in adults. In children, measuring both factors in the CSF may help us understand the neuropathogenic process leading to HIV-1-associated encephalopathy (HAE). Repository specimens from 27 perinatally HIV-1-infected children with HAE were assessed for HIV DNA copy by real-time polymerase chain reaction and compared with MCP1 2578G SNP mutations measured by digesting amplified 361 bp fragments. When compared with MCP1 2578G SNP, a significant number with the mutation had high HIV DNA compared with those with wild type (p < .01), with no levels detected in HIV-1-seronegative control specimens. There were six CSF specimens with enough supernatant to measure MCP1 levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which showed high levels in those with the MCP1 2578G mutation. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that CSF HIV DNA and MCP1 SNP can be measured and could be potential tools in future clinical studies to understand the pathogenesis of pediatric HAE."

Furthermore, myelomonoblasts that were cultured without the addition of growth factors displayed evidence of HIV replication through the presence of p24 antigen and reverse transcriptase activity, both of which lasted for 4 weeks in the supernatant fluid of the cell cultures.

Features of headache that were evaluated included frequency, duration, location, severity, and recent change in characteristics. In the HIV-seropositive population, the presence of headache and its specific features were correlated with the degree of immunosuppression as determined by absolute CD4 counts and Centers for Disease Control stages, the presence of other neurological symptoms and neurological signs, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) values. Headaches were common; approximately 50% of all subjects reported headache at study entry and 2 years later. Headache frequency and characteristics were not different between HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative subjects. Headache was neither more frequent nor different in HIV-seropositive individuals with advanced immunosuppression. There was no correlation between headache and abnormal CSF parameters, cranial MRI abnormalities, including the presence of sinusitis, or the use of zidovudine."

A 55-year-old woman with HIV/AIDS, well controlled on antiretroviral therapy (ART), CD4+ count in the 300 cells/μl range for >1 year presented with acute onset of headache, nausea and vomiting. She had been on her current ART regimen consisting of raltegravir, co-formulated emtricitabine/tenofovir and etravirine for three years and had been off Pneumocystis prophylaxis for 10 months (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Brain MRI showed multiple ring-enhancing, supratentorial and infra-tentorial parenchymal lesions suspicious for metastases. She had no other evidence of metastatic disease in her body. The possibilities of TE and primary CNS lymphoma were considered but deemed unlikely given the high CD4+ count. A brain biopsy demonstrated Toxoplasma tachyzoites. There was no evidence of lymphoma or carcinoma. Anti-toxoplasma treatment yielded good initial clinical and radiographic responses. While on TE maintenance therapy, she developed similar symptoms. Repeat MRI showed progression of lesions. Further work-up including CSF Epstein-Barr virus PCR and SPECT Th 201 imaging was not conclusive for CNS lymphoma. The patient's clinical condition deteriorated and she died. We postulate that functional immunological dysfunction is a possible mechanism by which our patient developed TE despite demonstrating sustained immune response on ART."

However, the effect of X4-HIV variants on the treatment response remains unclear. Here we determined whether the presence of X4-HIV variants influenced the time to undetectable viral load and CD4+ T cell reconstitution after initiation of cART in 732 patients. The presence of X4-HIV variants was determined by MT-2 assay prior to cART initiation and viral load and CD4+ T cell counts were analyzed every 3 to 6 months during a three year follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed to compare time to viral suppression and the absolute CD4+ T cell counts and increases in CD4+ T cell counts during follow-up were compared for patients with and without X4-HIV at start of cART. Patients harboring X4-HIV variants at baseline showed a delay in time to achieve viral suppression below the viral load detection limit. This delay in viral suppression was independently associated with high viral load and the presence of X4-HIV variants. Furthermore, the absolute CD4+ T cell counts were significantly lower in patients harboring X4-HIV variants at all time points during follow-up. However, no differences were observed in the increase in absolute CD4+ T cell numbers after treatment initiation, indicating that the reconstitution of CD4+ T cells is independent of the presence of X4-HIV variants. The emergence of X4-HIV has been associated with an accelerated CD4+ T cell decline during the natural course of infection and therefore, patients who develop X4-HIV variants may benefit from earlier treatment initiation in order to obtain faster reconstitution of the CD4+ T cell population to normal levels.

In addition, 14 HIV-infected children, aged 75-131 months, had spirometry performed. Resistance was significantly higher in infected children than in controls (0.84 +/- 0.3 vs 0.64 +/- 0.08 kPa x l(-1) x s; t = 9.991; P < 0.0001). Resistance decreased with age in controls (r = -0.95; P < 0.001), but not in infected children (r= -0.22; P = 0.105). Resistance did not correlate with mothers' intravenous drug addiction, perinatal data, T-cell subset numbers, treatment, clinical course, or presence of respiratory complications. Resistance was higher (t = 3.103; P < 0.003) in p24 antigen-positive than in negative children. Thirty-nine children underwent a second evaluation 12.3 months (range 11.1-14 months) after the first. Resistance was higher (t = 3.960; P < 0.0001) at the second evaluation compared to the first. Eight of 14 children had abnormal spirometric measurements. We conclude that perinatal HIV-1 infection is associated with increased airway resistance and often abnormal spirometry. The degree of abnormalities in resistance depends on the duration of the infection rather than on HIV-1-related respiratory complications."

We evaluated treatment-associated changes in plasma viral load by standard and immune complex-dissociated (ICD) HIV-1 p24 antigen assays, and, in a representative subset of patients (n = 46), by QC-PCR determination of virion-associated HIV-1 RNA. At baseline, HIV-1 RNA was quantifiable by QC-PCR in all patients tested (100%), whereas standard and ICD HIV-1 p24 antigen tests were positive (> or = 30 pg/ml) in 42% and 56%, respectively. All viral load parameters showed significant decreases from baseline within 1 week of initiation of zidovudine, as measured by standard p24 antigen assay, ICD p24 assay, and QC-PCR. At 1 week, patients treated with either 300 or 1,000 mg/day of L-697,661 showed significant decreases from baseline in plasma standard and ICD p24 antigen and QC-PCR-determined HIV-1 RNA levels. Whereas viral load decreases seen with zidovudine were sustained for the duration of treatment, plasma viral markers often returned to pretreatment levels despite ongoing L-697,661 treatment, with evidence of the emergence of drug-resistant virus. Whereas standard p24, ICD p24, and viral RNA levels changed similarly in response to treatment, the superior sensitivity and available dynamic range of plasma viral RNA assays like QC-PCR analysis provide an advantage for clinical monitoring of plasma viral load, allowing tracking of treatment-related changes even in patients with earlier stage disease and lower levels of viral load."

Our objective was to develop a pharmacologically based measure of intrapatient variability of concentrations and investigate its association with a patient's response to antiretroviral therapy. Efavirenz concentrations were obtained for 50 children enrolled in Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group study 382, a concentration-controlled trial of efavirenz plus nelfinavir and at least one nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Efavirenz pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from 24-h concentration-time profiles at weeks 2 and 6 and used to predict trough concentrations obtained during 1 year of therapy. A concentration predictability score, defined as the fraction of measured trough concentrations that fell within a +/-50% range of the predicted concentration, was used to place subjects into high and low concentration predictability groups. Relationships between this score and human immunodeficiency virus RNA levels in plasma were investigated. Eight of 33 children (24%) in the high-predictability group experienced viral rebound, compared with 9 of 17 children (53%) in the low-predictability group (P = 0.042). Children with low predictability scores exhibited a significantly shorter time to their first viral rebounds and were significantly more likely to experience viral rebound; the latter finding persisted after adjustment for baseline viral load and efavirenz exposure at week 6. This novel method for the quantitation of intrapatient concentration variability was independently predictive of virologic rebound. This measure may allow interventions to minimize therapeutic failure and is applicable to other drugs."

Eligible patients were hepatitis B surface antigen-positive men and women with compensated liver disease who were given lamivudine at least more than 6 months and had HBV polymerase gene mutation. Patients were assigned to receive adefovir 10 mg/day (Group 1) or adefovir 10 mg once daily and lamivudine 100 mg once daily combination during first 3 months, and then stopped lamivudine and continued adefovir (Group 2). Median age was 48 years (34 males and 20 females, and 35 were HBeAg-negative). Baseline median ALT, AST, and HBV DNA levels were 66 IU/l, 49 IU/l, and 6.7 log(10) copy/ml, respectively. Median adefovir therapy time and ALT normalization time were 9 and 3.5 months, respectively. There was no significant difference between groups according to the baseline HBV DNA, ALT, HBe Ag status, age, gender, and lamivudine resistance time. Virological and biochemical responses were similar in both groups during therapy. Two patients (8%) had ALT flare more than five times upper limit of normal without any clinical decompensation in Group 1. Mild ALT elevation according to baseline levels were found in 8 (27.6%) and 4 (17.4%) patients, respectively, in Group 2 and Group 1, and no statistically significance between two groups. In conclusion, this study showed that it is not necessary to continue lamivudine therapy while switching to AD therapy. Adefovir alone is effective in the treatment of patients with lamivudine resistant HBV infection and compensated liver disease, without significant clinical and laboratory flares. However, it is not easy to say that switching to AD with cessation of lamivudine is safe, because the study population is not enough for precise conclusion and resistance may be a considerable problem against AD in patients using long-term treatment."

Prospective, longitudinal data were examined from 1050 participants in two large, randomized, multi-centre antiretroviral clinical trials. QoL was assessed by the SF-12; adherence by the Terry Beirn Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS Antiretroviral Medication Self-report. Participants included 20% women, 53% African Americans, 16% Latinos; mean age was 39 years; mean baseline CD4+ cell count 230 cells/mm3; 89% were ART-naïve at entry. Baseline physical and mental health summary QoL scores were 45.4 and 42.9, comparable to scores reported in other advanced HIV populations. Significant improvements in mean QoL scores were seen for the group as a whole after 1 to 4 months on new ART regimens, and persisted for 12 months. Participants reporting 100% ART adherence achieved significantly higher QoL scores at 12 months compared to those with poorer adherence, particularly if 100% adherence was consistent (p < 0.001). Those with at least 80% ART adherence had smaller gains in QoL at 12 months when compared to baseline, while those with < 80% adherence had worsening of QoL. In this analysis, ART adherence was associated with improved QoL, particularly if adherence was sustained."

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analyses to predict odds for achieving outcomes were performed. Three hundred and fifty-two patients were included and followed-up for a median of 4.1 (IQR 2.1-5.9) years, 270 (76.7%) achieving a CD4+ T-cell count >500 cells/mm(3) and 197 (56%) achieving MTMR. Using three separate Cox models for both outcomes we demonstrated that independent predictors were: both absolute CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts, %CD4+ T cells, a higher CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio, and age. A likelihood-ratio test showed significant improvements in fitness for the prediction of either CD4+ >500/mm(3) or MTMR by multivariable analysis when the other immune markers at baseline, besides the absolute CD4+ count alone, were considered. In addition to baseline absolute CD4+ T-cell counts, pretreatment %CD4+ T cells and the CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio influence recovery of T-cell markers, and their consideration should influence the decision to start antiretroviral therapy. However, owing to the small sample size, further studies are needed to confirm these results in relation to clinical endpoints."

This study examined the levels of three such factors, genital tract lactoferrin [Lf], secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor [SLPI], and RANTES, in women at risk for acquiring HIV infection, as well as cofactors that may be associated with their presence. Women at high risk for HIV infection meeting established criteria (n = 62) and low-risk controls (n = 33) underwent cervicovaginal lavage (CVL), and the CVL fluid samples were assayed for Lf and SLPI. Subsets of 26 and 10 samples, respectively, were assayed for RANTES. Coexisting sexually transmitted infections and vaginoses were also assessed, and detailed behavioral information was collected. Lf levels were higher in high-risk (mean, 204 ng/ml) versus low-risk (mean, 160 ng/ml, P = 0.007) women, but SLPI levels did not differ, and RANTES levels were higher in only the highest-risk subset. Lf was positively associated only with the presence of leukocytes in the CVL fluid (P < 0.0001). SLPI levels were lower in women with bacterial vaginosis [BV] than in those without BV (P = 0.04). Treatment of BV reduced RANTES levels (P = 0.05). The influence, if any, of these three cofactors on HIV transmission in women cannot be determined from this study. The higher Lf concentrations observed in high-risk women were strongly associated with the presence of leukocytes, suggesting a leukocyte source and consistent with greater genital tract inflammation in the high-risk group. Reduced SLPI levels during BV infection are consistent with an increased risk of HIV infection, which has been associated with BV. However, the increased RANTES levels in a higher-risk subset of high-risk women were reduced after BV treatment."

During 1993-1995, 854 patients were tested for HTLV-I/II infection on entry into the clinic, of whom 25 were infected with HTLV-I and 35 with HTLV-II. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with coinfections were more likely to be black, aged over 35 years, and have a history of injection drug use. HIV-1/HTLV-I coinfections were associated with higher median CD8 counts on entry (p < 0.05), and HIV-1/HTLV-II coinfections were associated with higher median percent CD4 counts (p < 0.05) compared with patients infected with HIV only. Coinfection was not associated with an increased diagnosis of AIDS. These findings indicate that HIV-1/HTLV-I/II coinfections are frequently diagnosed and are associated with unique immune phenotypes. Given the lack of information regarding the influence of dual infection on clinical status, differentiation of HTLV-I from HTLV-II infections may be important in understanding the clinical significance of retroviral coinfections."

Flow cytometric analysis permitted us to detect CD38, a surface marker of early differentiation, as well as activation of T cells, on about half of healthy donor-derived CD4(+) T cells. In this study, we focused on the susceptibility of CD38(+) and CD38(-) subsets of CD4(+) T cells to HIV-1 infection with different coreceptor tropisms. About 20% of peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived resting CD4(+) T cells were recovered into the CD38(+) subset fraction by panning with a monoclonal antibody to CD38. Most of the cells in this CD38(high) fraction also expressed CD45RA and CD62L at higher intensities compared with those of CD38(low) fraction. CCR5(+) T cells predominated in the CD38(-) subset, although cell surface expression of CD4 and CXCR4 was almost similar between both subsets. This difference was consistent with a significantly higher susceptibility of the CD38(-) subset to a macrophage (M)-tropic HIV-1 strain. In contrast, it was shown that a T-tropic strain of HIV-1 could replicate more efficiently in the CD38(+) subset, although viral adsorption rates were similar between both subsets. Thus, the differential susceptibility of CD4(+) T cells to M(-) and T-tropic HIV-1 was associated with their surface expression of CD38."

This study was conducted to evaluate its safety and antiviral activity in patients with chronic HBV infection. Twenty patients (13 co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus, HIV) were randomized in a phase I/II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients who had been hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)/hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive for > or = 6 months, with elevated hepatic transaminases and serum HBV DNA > or = 50 pg ml-1, were randomized to adefovir dipivoxil 125 mg (n = 15) or placebo (n = 5) as a single, daily, oral dose for 28 days. Antiviral activity was assessed by changes in serum HBV DNA (using the Digene Hybrid Capture assay) and HBeAg/hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb) status. HBV DNA levels fell rapidly by > 1 log10 in all active drug recipients (median fall 1.8 log10 pg ml-1) but increased by 0.01 log10 pg ml-1 in controls (P = 0.002). Reductions were sustained during treatment. HBV DNA returned to baseline over 1-6 weeks following discontinuation of active drug. HBeAg became transiently undetectable in one patient on treatment and, in another, sustained seroconversion to HBeAb occurred 12 weeks after treatment ended. Liver transaminase elevations > 300 U l-1 were observed in three patients during therapy (leading to protocol-specified treatment discontinuation or dose reduction) and in four patients during follow-up. On-treatment transaminase elevations were associated with HIV status, occurring in three of six HIV-uninfected patients compared with none of nine who were HIV infected. In addition, a slower return to baseline of serum HBV DNA levels was observed in the non-HIV-infected patients. Treatment for chronic hepatitis B as a once-daily oral dose was well tolerated and associated with significant and sustained reductions in serum HBV DNA levels during treatment. Transaminase elevations, which may be related to the therapeutic effect, were observed during and after treatment. Further studies are warranted to investigate the safety, and optimum dose and duration, of adefovir dipivoxil treatment for chronic hepatitis B."

This qualitative study is part of a prospective multicentre investigation describing readiness for antiretroviral therapy (ART) and decision making in HIV-infected patients. The qualitative results present the daily experiences of people living with HIV in the treatment decision making process related to starting or changing ART. Based on a critical hermeneutic research design, interviews with twelve persons have been conducted. Two main categories were generated: ""dealing with oneself and others"" and ""understanding and being understood"". They describe the dialectical process of decision making with a focus on interactions with others. This process includes four themes: illness beliefs, health perspectives, therapy beliefs, life perspectives. The findings of this study reveal that partnerships of health care providers with HIV-infected patients are necessary for treatment decisions. Moreover; it is of major importance for health care providers to include patients' experiences and expertise and to allow time for the different dialogues."

The objective of this study was to characterize the activity spaces of PLWH from an urban area in Southeastern U.S., where the epidemic is among the nation's highest, and to examine how such activity spaces are associated with daily mood and health behaviors. In this small, pilot study, 11 participants were tracked with a global positioning system (GPS)-enabled application on their smartphones for 2 weeks. Activity spaces were created by connecting GPS points sequentially and adding buffers. Contextual exposure data (e.g., alcohol outlets) were connected to activity spaces. Participants also completed daily diary entry through texts 3 times per day regarding outcomes of substance use behaviors, mood, and medication adherence. This yielded a total of 18,007 GPS polyline records that we aggregated into 258 person-days that captured discrete occasions of exposure to contextual factors and subjects' behaviors and moods. On average, the participants spent 19% of their time awake during the 2-week periods in their residential census tract. Exposure to social and built environment factors such as alcohol outlets was greater when participants were outside versus inside their residential census tract. Exposures on daily routes were also significantly associated with ART adherence, alcohol consumption, and mood. Findings suggest substantial differences between activity spaces and residential contexts. Activity spaces are relevant for PLWH and may impact HIV care and behavioral outcomes such as ART adherence and substance use."

Three health beliefs indices were identified: antiretroviral therapy (ART) benefits, ART adherence self-efficacy, and beliefs about future HIV-related health concerns. Patients who experienced medication side-effects reported strong beliefs that HIV infection would cause them future health problems or distrust in the benefits of ART. AIDS diagnosis obtained through medical records or medication side-effects were not related to any of the three types of adherence. Beliefs about future HIV-related health concerns were associated with suboptimal dose adherence. Beliefs about ART benefits were associated with suboptimal schedule and dietary instructions adherence. Older age and partner were protective factors of schedule adherence. Data suggest that health beliefs may vary across type of adherence and that adherence behaviours may be a coping strategy to adjust antiretroviral therapy to one's daily living."

However, little is known about the specific contribution of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to stroke among HIV-infected individuals. The aims of this study were to analyze trends in the incidence rates of stroke in HIV-infected individuals during the combination antiretroviral (cART) era in Spain and to categorize them by the presence or absence of HCV coinfection. We analyzed hospital discharges with a diagnosis of stroke in Spain according to ICD-9-CM during 1997-2013. The study period was divided into four calendar periods (1997-1999, 2000-2003, 2004-2007, and 2008-2013). Patients were classified according to HCV serology. The number of HIV-infected patients was estimated based on data from the National Centre of Epidemiology. We calculated incidence rates (events per 10,000 patient-years) and in-hospital case fatality rates (CFR). The incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (HS) decreased in HIV-monoinfected patients (15.8 [1997-1999] to 6.5 [2008-2013]; P<0.001) and increased in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (1.3 [1997-1999] to 5.5 [2008-2013]; P<0.001). The incidence of ischemic stroke (IS) decreased in HIV-monoinfected patients (27.4 [1997-1999] to 21.7 [2008-2013]; P = 0.005) and increased in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (1.8 [1997-1999] to 11.9 [2008-2013]; P<0.001). The CFR was 3.3 times higher for HS than for IS for the whole study period. The CFR of HS in HIV-monoinfected patients decreased significantly (47.4% [1997-1999] to 30.6% [2008-2013]; P = 0.010) but did not change significantly among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (41.4% [1997-1999] to 44.7% [2008-2013]; P = 0.784). The CFR of IS in the whole HIV-infected population decreased significantly (14.6% [1997-1999] to 10.9% [2008-2013]; P = 0.034), although no significant differences were found when each group was analyzed separately. In conclusion, after the introduction of cART, HS and IS rates decreased in HIV-monoinfected individuals, but increased steadily in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals."

Anti-HIV was not detected in any of the serum samples from 97 females. 5/234 serum samples from males (2%) were repeatedly positive. Anti-HIV was first demonstrated in 1978, 3 years before the first patients with AIDS were recognized in Denmark. None of the 4 Danish patients with anti-HIV developed AIDS during a follow-up period of 1-7 years. However, at the time of follow-up in 1985 3 had decreased cell mediated immunity. The hepatitis B infection had an uncomplicated course in 4/5 patients with anti-HIV. One patient had a protracted delta hepatitis and was a HBsAg carrier before as well as after the acute hepatitis. Thus, the HIV infection did not cause any complicated course in this study."
6246,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Several all-oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) combination therapies including two fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) have been recently licensed for treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection. Results of pivotal trials with these new compounds are now also available in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV-coinfected patients, highlighting that, in the DAA era, differences no longer do exist in efficacy between HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. This review will give an overview of the key DAA-containing studies in HIV/HCV genotype 1 coinfection and give guidance on how and when these should be used in clinical practice. Simplified DAA-based and potentially interferon-free HCV therapy regimens are characterized by smaller pill burden, better tolerability, shorter treatment durations, and higher cure rates. With first pilot studies in HCV treatment-naive and treatment-experienced persons with HCV/HIV coinfection demonstrating sustained virological response rates above 95 %, interferon (IFN)-free DAA combinations should be considered the new standard of care for chronic HCV. Per both European and US treatment guidelines, HCV treatment indications and DAA drug selection in HIV-coinfected patients are no longer different from HCV-monoinfected patients as cure rates in HCV-monoinfected and HCV-coinfected patients are superimposable. Drug-drug interactions with the new DAAs and concomitant antiretroviral therapy, however, have to be checked carefully prior to selecting DAAs due to commonly shared metabolization pathways. In countries with access to the new DAAs, interferon-free DAA combination therapy for HCV genotype 1 infection is strongly recommended. Agents should be selected based upon HCV genotype and according to current guidelines. Potential drug-drug interactions between HIV antiretrovirals and HCV therapy need to be checked, and if necessary, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has to be adapted to the respective HCV therapy. Key Points• HCV treatment in HIV-coinfected patients is the same as in HCV-monoinfected patients as response rates under DAA in the setting of HIV coinfection have been as good as in HCV-monoinfected patients. • IFN-free DAA combinations should be considered standard of care for chronic HCV genotype 1 coinfection. • Drug-drug interactions with the new DAAs and concomitant antiretroviral therapy have to be accounted for due to shared metabolic pathways via the cytochrome p450 system and drug transporters. • Major limitations in treatment uptake are access to DAA which is increasingly driven by the cost of the medications.

19884,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,A 17-year-old African American female with human immunodeficiency virus infection presented with an unresectable intracranial neoplasm with mass effect upon the brainstem. Stereotactic biopsy revealed an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated leiomyosarcoma. Radiation therapy and gemcitabine were used to shrink the mass with the aim to make it surgically resectable. Prolonged neutropenia and recurrent skin infections led to the discontinuation of gemcitabine. The mass stabilized after radiation therapy and has decreased in size in 15 months of follow-up. EBV has been demonstrated in most smooth muscle tumors associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and other immunocompromised states. This is the first documented case of an EBV-positive intracranial leiomyosarcoma in a pediatric human immunodeficiency virus patient.

The patient was treated with interferon-alpha (INF-alpha) because plasma aminotransferase levels had been elevated and a liver biopsy had showed chronic active hepatitis. Her urinary protein excretion decreased as liver function normalized and her serum HCV-RNA was negative during treatment. Eleven weeks after completion of INF-alpha treatment, she suddenly presented with nephrotic-range proteinuria, although an improvement in the hepatic function was maintained. Renal pathologic findings were consistent with membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN), and HBsAg was detected in the glomeruli but not HCV. After treatment with prednisolone, her 24-hour protein excretion was below 0.7 g/day. To our knowledge this is the first report on hepatitis B virus MGN with nephrotic syndrome following IFN-alpha therapy for HCV. This suggests that treatment with INF-alpha might affect the immune processes and may be associated with the pathogenic mechanism in this patient."

The aim of the study was to quantify TTV and TTMV in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients to study the relationship between the TTV and TTMV viral loads and the severity of liver disease. We carried out a cross-sectional study in 245 patients coinfected with HIV and HCV (HIV/HCV-group), 114 patients monoinfected with HIV (HIV-group), and 100 healthy blood donors (Control-group). Plasma samples were tested for TTV and TTMV by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prevalences of TTV and TTMV infections in the HIV/HCV-group and the HIV-group were significantly higher than the Control-group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, TTV and TTMV coinfections were found in 92.2 % (226/245) in the HIV/HCV-group, 84.2 % (96/114) in the HIV-group, and 63 % (63/100 %) in the Control-group (p ≤ 0.05). HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with HIV viral load ≥50 copies/mL and patients with severe activity grade had the highest viral loads of TTV and TTMV (p ≤ 0.05). HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with high TTV load (>2.78 log copies/μL) had increased odds of having advanced fibrosis or severe necroinflammatory activity grade in the liver biopsy. Moreover, HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with high TTMV load (>1.88 log copies/μL) had decreased odds of having no/minimal fibrosis and no/mild activity grade, and increased odds of having a high fibrosis progression rate. In conclusion, TTV and TTMV might play a role in the development of liver disease in immunodeficiency patients, such as the patients coinfected with HIV and HCV."

We used data from 567 HIV-infected participants of the Nutrition for Healthy Living study with study visits between 9/1/2000 and 1/31/2004 and determined mortality through 12/31/2006. MS was defined using modified National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. Cox proportional hazards for all-cause mortality were estimated for baseline MS status and for its individual defining criteria. There were 83 deaths with median follow-up of 63 months. Baseline characteristics associated with increased risk of mortality were: older age in years (univariate hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, p<0.01), current smoking (HR 1.99, p=0.02), current heroin use (HR 1.97, p=0.02), living in poverty (HR 2.0, p<0.01), higher mean HIV viral load (HR 1.81, p<0.01), and having a BMI <18 (HR 5.84, p<0.01). For MS and its criteria, only low HDL was associated with increased risk of mortality on univariate analysis (HR 1.84, p=0.01). However, metabolic syndrome (adjusted HR 2.31, p=0.02) and high triglycerides (adjusted HR 3.97, p<0.01) were significantly associated with mortality beyond 36 months follow-up.

An observational cohort study of HIV-negative adults with PJP documented by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) through Gomori-Grocott staining or immunofluorescence, admitted to one intensive care unit (ICU) for acute respiratory failure, was undertaken. From 1990 to 2010, 70 patients (24 females, 46 males) were included, with a mean age of 58.6 ± 18.3 years. The mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS)-II was 36.9 ± 20.4. Underlying conditions included hematologic malignancies (n = 21), vasculitis (n = 13), and solid tumors (n = 13). Most patients were receiving systemic corticosteroids (n = 63) and cytotoxic drugs (n = 51). Not a single patient received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as PJP prophylaxis. Endotracheal intubation (ETI) was required in 42 patients (60.0 %), including 38 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In-ICU mortality was 52.9 % overall, reaching 80.9 % and 86.8 %, respectively, for patients who required ETI and for patients with ARDS. In the univariate analysis, in-ICU mortality was associated with SAPS-II (p = 0.0131), ARDS (p < 0.0001), shock (p < 0.0001), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) on BAL (p = 0.0031). In the multivariate analysis, only ARDS was associated with in-ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR] 23.4 [4.5-121.9], p < 0.0001). PJP in non-HIV patients remains a serious disease with high in-hospital mortality. Pulmonary co-infection with HSV or CMV may contribute to fatal outcome."

Matching variables were: age, gender, number of circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes, cause of hospital admission, hospitalization in the same ward within the 6 weeks of diagnosis of the case, and length of stay before the day of infection in the case. Eighty-four cases and 168 matched controls were studied. Nosocomial bloodstream infections complicated about 3 of 1000 hospital days per patient in the study period. With step-wise logistic regression analysis, the most important predictors for developing nosocomial bloodstream infections were: increasing value of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score (p = .001) and use of central venous catheter (CVC) (p = .002). The excess of hospital stay attributable to nosocomial bloodstream infections was 17 days. The crude mortality rate was 43%. The attributable mortality rate was estimated to be 27% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 13%-48%). The estimated risk ratio for death was 3.91 (95% CI = 2.06-7.44). Multivariate analysis identified two prognostic indicators that were significantly associated with unfavorable outcome of bloodstream infections: number of circulating CD4+ T cells <100/mm3 (p = .002) and APACHE II score >15 (p = .01). Nosocomial bloodstream infections are more common in patients with advanced HIV disease. Important cofactors are high APACHE II score and use of CVC.

Between 1995 and 2002, 1,412 HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected women enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study were followed for a median of 6 years. Twenty-nine women incurred incident TB, and 222 died of AIDS-related causes. Accounting for age, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA level, serum albumin level, and non-TB AIDS at study entry, as well as for time-varying CD4 cell count, CD4 cell count nadir, HIV-1 RNA level, peak HIV-1 RNA level, serum albumin level, HIV-related symptoms, non-TB AIDS, anti-Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis, antiretroviral therapy, and household income, the hazard ratio for AIDS-related death comparing time after incident TB with time before incident TB was 4.0 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2, 14).

The aim of this prospective study of 105 patients was to compare the incidence of progression to severe antiretroviral-related liver toxicity in 66 patients pretreated (36 with interferon-alpha [IFNalpha], 30 with IFNalpha plus ribavirin), and 39 patients not pretreated. The subjects could choose whether to receive anti-HCV therapy. Severe liver toxicity was defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level > or =5-times the upper limit of normal in patients with normal baseline levels and > or =3.5-times in those with increased baseline levels. The authors also estimated the hepatotoxicity-related risk of discontinuing antiretroviral therapy. During antiretroviral therapy, 10 subjects (9.5%) experienced severe hepatotoxicity: 4 of 66 pretreated patients and 6 of 39 untreated patients (24-month survival: 94% +/- 2.9% vs. 85% +/- 5.8%). After adjusting for baseline CD4 cell counts, ALT levels, histologic scores, HCV and HIV viremia, HCV genotype (genotype 1 in 29% of pretreated patients and 20% of patients not pretreated), and previous anti-HCV therapy, the risk of discontinuing anti-HIV treatment was significantly higher in the anti-HCV untreated patients (RR = 10.4; 95% CI: 1.6-66; p =.0127) and in those with increased baseline ALT levels (RR = 1.014; 95% CI: 1.006-1.021; p =.0005). The authors' data suggest that previous treatment of chronic active HCV is an independent factor associated with a decrease of severe liver toxicity as the result of a subsequent antiretroviral regimen. The authors also confirm that the baseline level of ALT is an important prognostic factor for increased liver damage during antiretroviral therapy."

While antibody specificity is crucial for neutralization, other antibody characteristics, such as subclass, have not been explored. Our objective was to compare the efficiencies of immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses from polyclonal human HIV immune globulin (HIVIG) in the neutralization of HIV-1 strains differing in coreceptor tropism. IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 were enriched from HIVIG by using protein A-Sepharose. All three subclasses bound major HIV-1 proteins, as shown by Western blot assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In HIV-1 fusion assays using X4, R5, or X4R5 envelope-expressing effector cells, IgG3 more efficiently blocked fusion. In neutralization assays with cell-free viruses using X4 (LAI, IIIB), R5 (BaL), and X4R5 (DH123), a similar hierarchy of neutralization was found: IgG3 > IgG1 > IgG2. IgG3 has a longer, more flexible hinge region than the other subclasses. To test whether this is important, IgG1 and IgG3 were digested with pepsin to generate F(ab')(2) fragments or with papain to generate Fab fragments. IgG3 F(ab')(2) fragments were still more efficient in neutralization than F(ab')(2) of IgG1. However, Fab fragments of IgG3 and IgG1 demonstrated equivalent neutralization capacities and the IgG3 advantage was lost. These results suggest that the IgG3 hinge region confers enhanced HIV-neutralizing ability. Enrichment and stabilization of IgG3 may therefore lead to improved HIVIG preparations. The results of this study have implications for the improvement of passive immunization with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies and suggest that HIV-1 vaccines which induce high-titer IgG3 responses could be advantageous."

The purpose of this study was to examine HIV-positive women and minority patients' satisfaction with hospital care. The study was part of a larger funded study that explored potential health care disparities for HIV-positive women and minority persons in the era of HIV combination drug therapy. A convenience sample of 50 HIV-positive persons was recruited from four medical centers/hospitals in a South Florida community. The multi-ethnic sample included 31 women and 19 men. The survey tool used was Cleary's HIV-Infected Patient's In-Hospital Questionnaire. Findings revealed that participants were generally satisfied with their hospital care. Physicians, nurses, and the hospital environment received satisfactory ratings. However, several problem areas were identified, including pain management and education on side effects of HIV medications, indicating the need for interventions to improve care. Experimental AIDS drugs were discussed with less than half of the participants, suggesting that HIV-positive women and minority patients may not have equal access to clinical drug trials. Further research is also needed to determine whether attitudes conveyed by health care providers influence HIV-positive patients to be wary of advance directives. The competence of nurses experienced in acute-care nursing of persons with HIV/AIDS was an important factor in patient satisfaction. A lack of experienced acute-care AIDS nurses may ultimately lead to a decrease in HIV-positive patients' satisfaction with hospital care."

The quantitative results from the test have been validated using international reference specimens of known titer and a reference solution hybridization test. The test has small variability considering the wide dynamic range. The CV was 14% within one experiment and 32% to 39% between independent experiments. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative, anti-HBc-positive blood donor sera (n = 25) were all negative for HBV DNA in the new test, whereas 63% (n = 19) of HBsAg-positive healthy carriers had measurable quantities of HBV DNA. In five example cases of chronic hepatitis B patients responding to alfa-interferon treatment but remaining virus positive, HBV DNA was consistently present in posttreatment sera in a titer range 4 x 10(3) to 10(6)/mL not detectable by the conventional hybridization test. In two complete responders, the HBV DNA titer decreased over six orders of magnitude to below cutoff of the test. In four liver transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis B, viral recurrence was detected by the new test at an early stage much before the clinical relapse. Unlike serology, the test was suitable also in patients under anti-HBs immunoprophylaxis. In conclusion, the new colorimetric polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test allowed thousandfold increased sensitivity in quantification of HBV DNA in patient sera. The test may have future applications in improving assessment of efficacy of antiviral treatment and guiding therapeutic interventions."

Since both viruses are individually known to cause the pathologies mentioned above, co-infection with both HBV and HCV would be expected to be linked with higher morbidity as well as mortality and impact healthcare resource utilisation. Precise estimate of the prevalence of HBV/HCV co-infection would be needed to formulate policy decisions and plan communal health interventions. This systematic review and meta-analysis, therefore, aims to understand the prevalence of HBV and HCV co-infection in India based on the available literature. Following PRISMA guidelines, primary studies reporting the prevalence of HBV/HCV co-infection in India were retrieved through searches conducted in PubMed, Google SCHOLAR, Medline, Cochrane Library, WHO reports, Indian and International journals online. All online searches were conducted between December 2016 and February 2017. Meta-analysis was carried out using StatsDirect statistical software. Thirty studies published between 2000 and 2016 conducted across six regions of India were included in this review. The pooled HBV/HCV co-infection prevalence rate across the thirty studies was 1.89% (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.2%-2.4%). A high heterogeneity was observed between prevalence estimates. The HBV/HCV co-infection prevalence in different subgroups varied from 0.02% (95% CI = 0.0019%-0.090%) to 3.2% (95% CI = 1.3%-5.9%). The pooled prevalence of HBV/HCV co-infection in India was found to be 1.89%. This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed high prevalence of HBV/HCV co-infection in chronic liver patients, followed by HIV-positive patients, and then followed by persons who inject drugs and kidney disease patients."

Our study was designed to identify factors contributing to progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma by taking the entire period of infection into consideration. Two hundred thirteen patients with transfusion-associated hepatitis type C chronic liver disease were included in this study. They did not have either a history of antiviral therapy or any other potential causes of chronic liver disease except for transfusion. Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b was detected in 144 (68%) patients, followed by 2a in 51 (24%), 2b in 11 (5%), 1a in 4 (2%), and coinfection with 1b and 2a in 3 (1%). The log-rank test in the Kaplan-Meier method revealed that the cumulative percentage of cirrhosis-free or hepatocellular carcinoma-free patients became significantly lower as the transfusion age went up. Patient age at the time of transfusion was the only independent factor related to disease progression in multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazards model. Thus age at transfusion should be taken into consideration in designing the optimal follow-up schedule and therapy in patients with posttransfusion-associated chronic hepatitis C."
2186,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"In chronic hepatitis B (CHB), failure to control hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with T cell dysfunction. HBV transgenic mice mirror many features of the human disease, including T cell unresponsiveness, and thus represent an appropriate model in which to test novel therapeutic strategies. To date, the tolerant state of CD8(+) T cells in these animals could be altered only by strong immunogens or by immunization with HBV antigen-pulsed dendritic cells; however, the effectors induced were unable to suppress viral gene expression or replication. Because of the known stimulatory properties of alpha interferon (IFN-α) and interleukin-15 (IL-15), this study explored the therapeutic potential of liver-directed gene transfer of these cytokines in a murine model of CHB using adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery. This combination not only resulted in a reduction in the viral load in the liver and the induction of an antibody response but also gave rise to functional and specific CD8(+) immunity. Furthermore, when splenic and intrahepatic lymphocytes from IFN-α- and IL-15-treated animals were transferred to new HBV carriers, partial antiviral immunity was achieved. In contrast to previous observations made using either cytokine alone, markedly attenuated PD-L1 induction in hepatic tissue was observed upon coadministration. An initial study with CHB patient samples also gave promising results. Hence, we demonstrated synergy between two stimulating cytokines, IL-15 and IFN-α, which, given together, constitute a potent approach to significantly enhance the CD8(+) T cell response in a state of immune hyporesponsiveness. Such an approach may be useful for treating chronic viral infections and neoplastic conditions."

Four clinically asymptomatic and treatment-naïve clade A HIV-1-infected patients were selected from a cohort of 274 African women, because they were free of all the biological cofactors known to modify the kinetics of viral production in the genital tract. HIV RNA envelope sequences (V1 to V3) derived from plasma and cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) were amplified, subcloned, and sequenced. CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptor usage was determined by production of recombinant viral particles, followed by single-cycle infection assays of indicator cell lines, using the tropism recombinant test. In these four selected patients, CVS-derived sequences appeared to be genetically distinct from blood-derived sequences (P < or = 0.001). Two patients were found to harbor virus populations with only the R5 phenotype in both compartments, whereas viruses using CXCR4 in addition to CCR5 were detected in two other patients. In particular, one woman harbored genital virus populations with mixed R5 and X4 phenotypes associated with peripheral blood populations with only the R5 phenotype. These results demonstrate genetic compartmentalization of HIV between the plasma and genital secretions of clinically asymptomatic, treatment-naïve, clade A-infected women. Also, for one patient, we report phenotypic coreceptor usage differences between the systemic (R5) and genital (R5/X4) viral populations. These features may be critical for the development of further mucosal vaccines, therapies, or new preventive strategies to block heterosexual transmission."

Cross-sectional study was carried out, comparing HIV-infected persons who had interrupted antiretroviral therapy in the past (interruption group, IG) with persons who had never discontinued therapy (noninterruption group, NIG). Interruption was defined as the discontinuation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for more than 15 days after previous treatment of at least 15 days. All the participants were on therapy. Demographic, clinical, and neurocognitive variables were assessed. The primary end point was the percentage of people with neurocognitive impairment. The score in different neurocognitive domains was a secondary end point. A total of 83 subjects participated in the study (IG: n = 27; NIG: n = 56). Demographic and clinical characteristics were balanced between the groups, except for years since HIV diagnosis (IG, 13.8; NIG, 10.2 [P = .003]). The percentage of people with neurocognitive impairment was significantly higher in the IG group (IG, 59.25%; NIG, 33.92% [P = 0.02]). As for scores in neurocognitive domains, individuals in the IG showed worse neurocognitive functioning, and significant differences in attention/working memory and information processing speed were found. The adjusted analysis supported the unadjusted analysis. In this study, a higher prevalence of neurocognitive impairment was detected in HIV-infected persons who had interrupted antiretroviral therapy in the past. Additionally, neurocognitive functioning was observed to be more impaired in the same individuals. Further studies should examine the potential negative effects of antiretroviral therapy interruptions on neurocognitive functioning."

Depressive symptoms were defined by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist and alcohol use was measured through frequency of consumption questions. Antiretroviral use was assessed using a standardized survey and confirmed by medical record review. Predictors of ART use were determined via logistic regression.

3991,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"A mathematical model examined a potential therapy for controlling viral infections using genetically modified viruses. The control of the infection is an indirect effect of the selective elimination by an engineered virus of infected cells that are the source of the pathogens. Therefore, this engineered virus could greatly compensate for a dysfunctional immune system compromised by AIDS. In vitro studies using engineered viruses have been shown to decrease the HIV-1 load about 1000-fold. However, the efficacy of this potential treatment for reducing the viral load in AIDS patients is unknown. The present model studied the interactions among the HIV-1 virus, its main host cell (activated CD4+ T cells), and a therapeutic engineered virus in an in vivo context; and it examined the conditions for controlling the pathogen. This model predicted a significant drop in the HIV-1 load, but the treatment does not eradicate HIV. A basic estimation using a currently engineered virus indicated an HIV-1 load reduction of 92% and a recovery of host cells to 17% of their normal level. Greater success (98% HIV reduction, 44% host cells recovery) is expected as more competent engineered viruses are designed. These results suggest that therapy using viruses could be an alternative to extend the survival of AIDS patients."

Type I interferons are immunomodulatory cytokines that induce antiviral factors and have been evaluated for the treatment of HIV-infected individuals, resulting in moderate reduction of viremia and inconclusive data about their effect on reservoir size. Here, we assessed the potential of pegylated IFN-α2a (pIFN-α2a) to reduce the viral reservoir in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected, ART-treated rhesus macaques (RMs). We found that pIFN-α2a treatment of animals in which virus replication is effectively suppressed with ART is safe and well tolerated, as no major clinical side effects were observed.

However, since currently used treatments are unable to eradicate HIV from infected individuals, therapy must be lifelong, with the potential for short- and long-term, known and unknown, side effects, and high costs for health care systems. In addition, different patterns of unexpected systemic complications involving heart, bone, kidney and other organs are emerging. Although their pathogenesis is still under debate, they are likely to originate from chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction associated to HIV infection. A final consideration regards the dishomogenous pattern of HIV disease worldwide. In fact, access to HIV diagnosis, treatment and care are seriously limited in the geographical areas that are most affected, like Africa, which sustains 70% of the global burden of the infection. This is one of the greatest challenges that international institutions are asked to face today."

In some studies, CTLs were found to kill a large fraction of the productively infected cells relative to the viral cytopathicity, whereas in others CTLs were suggested to kill only a small fraction of infected cells. In this review, we compile published estimates of CTL-mediated death rates, and examine whether these studies permit determining the rate at which CTLs kill HIV-1 infected cells. We highlight potential misinterpretations of the CTL-killing rates from the escape rates of mutants, and from perturbations of the steady state viral load during chronic infection. Our major conclusion is that CTL-mediated killing rates remain unknown. But contrary to current consensus, we argue that killing rates higher than one per day are perfectly consistent with the experimental data, which would imply that the majority of the productively infected cells could still die from CTL-mediated killing rather than from viral cytopathicity.

The patient was maintained on antiretroviral therapy for HIV as well as medication to suppress HBV and had previously undergone treatment for HCV with durable sustained virologic response. The patient was clinically well without any symptoms or evidence of liver decompensation. Laboratory findings were notable for aminotransferase activities in the 200 to 225 U/L range that had been persistent for several months. An extensive workup for the etiology of the aminotransferase elevation ensued. Imaging studies showed no evidence of biliary obstruction. Serology revealed negative autoantibodies, negative serum HCV-RNA, and low level HBV-DNA by polymerase chain reaction. Further testing revealed positive hepatitis delta virus (HDV) antibody and positive HDV RNA in the serum. A percutaneous liver biopsy was performed to further elucidate the cause of the elevated aminotransferase activities. Based on histology, serology, and clinical presentation, a diagnosis of chronic HDV infection was made. HDV infection should be considered in patients with known chronic viral hepatitis B with low viral load, who present with worsening liver function or elevation in aminotransferase activities."

MST is an intensive, home-based family therapy previously used for the treatment of serious antisocial behavior. Goals of the study were to assess the feasibility of the MST program and its effectiveness for improving health outcomes among children who were treated. The study was conducted by retrospective chart review. Ninety percent of children and families referred to the program accepted the referral and 95% received a full dose of treatment, suggesting high program feasibility. Nineteen children participated in the program. General HIV knowledge on the part of caregivers improved significantly over the course of treatment. Although caregiver-reported adherence did not change, viral loads were found to significantly decrease from referral to the end of MST treatment, with the mean change reflecting a greater than 1 log10 decrease. The majority of children maintained these improvements during the 3 months after treatment termination. Results suggest that MST holds promise as an intervention for improving health outcomes among pediatric patients with HIV."

The majority of cases occurred in residents of Roka commune. The Cambodian National Center for HIV/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), Dermatology and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (NCHADS) investigated the outbreak in collaboration with the University of Health Sciences in Phnom Penh and members of the Roka Cluster Investigation Team. By February 28, 2015, NCHADS had confirmed 242 cases of HIV infection among the 8,893 commune residents, an infection rate of 2.7%. Molecular investigation of the HIV strains present in this outbreak indicated that the majority of cases were linked to a single HIV strain that spread quickly within this community. An NCHADS case-control study identified medical injections and infusions as the most likely modes of transmission. In response to this outbreak, the Government of Cambodia has taken measures to encourage safe injection practices by licensed medical professionals, ban unlicensed medical practitioners, increase local capacity for HIV testing and counseling, and expand access to HIV treatment in Battambang province. Measures to reduce the demand for unnecessary medical injections and the provision of unsafe injections are needed.

We have analyzed the effect of ART on numerical distribution, expression of chemokine receptors, and ex vivo production of inflammatory cytokines by peripheral blood (PB) monocytes and DCs in a cohort of chronically infected HIV-1-positive patients. Patients were tested before therapy and at weeks +2, +4, +8, +12, and +52 after starting ART.Our results show an incomplete T-cell immune reconstitution in chronically infected patients who had undetectable plasma viremia while taking ART for 1 year. This was associated with persistent abnormalities at week +52 of ART, corresponding to increased numbers of CD16 DCs and monocytes, as well as altered expression of CXC chemokine receptors, in the form of increased CXCR1 expression on monocytes and decreased reactivity for CXCR2 and/or CXCR4 on myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs. In addition, an abnormally high spontaneous ex vivo secretion of inflammatory cytokines by CD16 DCs and monocytes was still detected after 1 year of ART. These abnormalities were especially pronounced in patients with less than 200 CD4 T cells/microL, which could be related to the persistence of undetected viral replication and sustained immune activation."

We present here the case of a 58 year old man who presented with cytopenias, leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the skin and glomerulopathy, and was diagnosed as MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts - RAEB 1). The patient also tested positive for HTLV-1 by PCR. After 8 monthly cycles of 5-azacytidine he achieved a complete hematologic remission.

Among 655 eligible participants, HCV genotype prevalence was: G1a: 48% (n=313), G1b: 6% (n=41), G2a: 3% (n=20), G2b: 7% (n=46), G3a: 33% (n=213), G4a: <1% (n=4), G6a: 1% (n=8), G6e: <1% (n=1), and unclassifiable: 1% (n=9). The mean age was 36 years, 162 (25%) were female, and 164 (25%) were HIV+. Among 501 participants with HCV G1a and G3a, 31% (n=156) were in a pair/cluster. Factors independently associated with phylogenetic clustering included: age <40 (versus age≥40, adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03, 2.63), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (AOR=1.82; 95% CI 1.18, 2.81), HCV seroconversion (AOR=3.05; 95% CI 1.40, 6.66), and recent syringe borrowing (AOR 1.59; 95% CI 1.07, 2.36)."

Thirty four women worked as window prostitutes, 120 picked up their clients in bars, clubs, and saunas. Blood samples were taken from 123 women. One (0.8%) was seropositive for HIV1, 19 (15.4%) had Hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc), eight (6.4%) showed markers of syphilis. None of them were Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. Hepatitis C antibodies (anti-HCV) were present in the serum of three women (2.4%). Overall STD seroprevalence was higher in the group of window prostitutes than in the group of club prostitutes. One woman admitted intravenous drug use. Former testing for anti-HIV antibodies had been performed in 102 (66.5%) respondents, of whom 84 (82.3%) were tested in the year preceding the interview. In 74.5% of the cases, these tests were requested by the women themselves. These results suggest that HIV infection is not yet prevalent in non-intravenous drug using prostitutes in Ghent, but that this situation may change considering their higher rates of past STD. Window prostitutes are at higher risk than club prostitutes. Testing for HIV seems to be common practice, mostly at the request of the women themselves. Health education should discourage the notion of testing as an alternative to using condoms."

We evaluated patterns of medication non-persistence among HIV-infected drug users enrolled in a prospective, 6-month randomized controlled trial of directly administered antiretroviral therapy (DAART). Medication-taking behavior was assessed via direct observation and MEMS data. Of 74 participants who initiated DAART, 59 (80%) subjects were non-persistent with medication for 3 or more consecutive days. Thirty-one participants (42%) had 2 or more episodes of non-persistence. Higher depressive symptoms were strongly associated with non-persistence episodes of ≥ 3 days (AOR: 17.4, P = 0.02) and ≥ 7 days AOR: 5.4, P = 0.04). High addiction severity (AOR 3.2, P = 0.03) was correlated with non-persistence ≥ 7 days, and injection drug use (AOR: 15.2, P = 0.02) with recurrence of non-persistence ≥ 3 days. Time to regimen change was shorter for NNRTI-based regimens compared to PI-based ones (HR: 3.0, P = 0.03).

EQ-5D, SF-36, SF-6D, mood disorder, clinical and substance misuse data were collected. Mean scores and preference derived utility scores were calculated. Statistical relationships between health-related quality of life and other variables were explored using univariate and multivariate analysis. Fifty-five patients were recruited, 64% were males. The mean anxiety value was 11.44 (anxious) and mean depression score was 9.3 (borderline depressed). The mean EQ-5D utility was 0.45 (95% CI 0.35, 0.55) and mean SF-6D utility was 0.52 (95% CI 0.48, 0.55). There was no statistical relationship between HIV indices, substance misuse and EQ-5D and SF-6D utility. Anxiety and depression were significantly correlated with EQ-5D and SF-6D utility values on univariate and multivariate analysis. Health-related quality of life was reduced in this HIV-infected intravenous drug user population. Whilst hepatitis C co-infection and substance misuse did not affect health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression had a significant impact on it. "

Depression influences quality of life, social relationships and adherence to medication therapy. Little is known about depression among Hispanic men with HIV infection. The purpose of this pilot study was to describe the relationships of depression to other psychosocial factors (self-esteem, Hispanic stress, substance abuse and violence) and cultural factors (familism and Hispanic stress) among a sample of Hispanic men with HIV infection. Using a cross-sectional, descriptive research design a convenience sample of 46 Hispanic men with HIV infection was recruited and surveyed from the South Florida area of the USA. The majority of the participants (65%; n = 30) were depressed. In addition, the majority of participants reported high familism and self-esteem and low Hispanic stress. A history of substance abuse and childhood and adult violence were common. Significant relationships were noted between depression, and self-esteem, Hispanic stress, substance abuse, and adult physical violence. Healthcare providers need to be aware of the high rates of depression, substance abuse and violence that may occur among Hispanic men with HIV infection. More research is needed to further explore the relationship of these factors, as well as to determine the impact that these variables have on adherence to medication therapy among Hispanic men with HIV infection."

Each of 186 subjects studied were assigned to one of four response quadrants. Quadrants A (x-, y+) and D (x+, y-) defined the effect of a change in virus load on the inverse change in CD4+ cell count expected from the natural history of HIV infection or antiretroviral therapy. Quadrants B (x+, y+) and C (x-, y-) defined the dissociation of the inverse relationship between the relative changes in CD4+ cell count and viral load that resulted from the hypothesized effect of putative virologic or immunologic response modifiers. Of the response modifiers studied, only the syncytium-inducing phenotype resulted in a complete dissociation of this inverse relationship. The analysis provided an integrated virological and immunological approach to better understand therapeutic responses and potential dissociation between changes in viral RNA and CD4+ cell count. This type of analysis may be helpful for individualizing patient management as well as designing and analyzing studies of HIV-1 antiretroviral drugs and disease pathogenesis."
14418,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The paradigm of AIDS patient care has evolved to that of a chronic disease that is manageable with combination antiretroviral therapy. Intermittent adherence to antiretroviral regimens, however, has been associated with the selection of HIV mutations, resulting in drug-resistant virus. Medication compliance has become a vital component in the care of HIV-infected patients. This study was designed to assess the degree of medication compliance with zidovudine (ZDV) over a 2-month period among a convenience sample of 23 ambulatory patients with HIV infection. Enrollment took place during February to March 1995, when monotherapy with ZDV was considered the standard of care. Medication compliance was assessed by three methods: patient self-report determined by questionnaire, pharmacy refill records from the 3 months immediately before entry in the study, and an electronic monitoring system (Medication Event Management Systems [MEMS], Aprex Corp., Fremont, CA), which records the date and time of each opening of the medication vials. MEMS was utilized among a subgroup of eight participants over a 2-month period. Despite greater than 95% (22 of 23) of the subjects reporting that they believed ZDV was life prolonging, a majority took < or = 75% of the prescribed doses of ZDV as identified by both refill and MEMS methods. The mean percentage compliance over a 2-month period of observation for MEMS and pharmacy refill record review methods was 66% and 78%, respectively (p = 0.294). Among the subgroup of eight in the MEMS evaluation, 88% reported taking their ZDV according to the directions, all of the time. These results demonstrate that reliance upon patient self-report of medication compliance is less accurate than MEMS or pharmacy refill records, and that reliance on self-reporting could lead to erroneous assumptions of the patient's true drug compliance. In addition, the study suggests that pharmacy refill records may provide a method of assessing compliance that is equivalent to MEMS but is less experimental, and can easily be followed and interpreted by pharmacists and other clinicians caring for patients infected with HIV. Most importantly, relatively poor compliance rates demonstrated by MEMS raises serious concern for widespread development of HIV resistance to the more complicated, multiple-drug regimens in present use."

The goal of this study was to determine if sclerostin is related to bone physiology and cardiovascular disease during antiretroviral treatment in HIV-infected persons. This was a cross-sectional analysis from study entry into the Stopping Atherosclerosis and Treating Unhealthy bone with RosuvastatiN in HIV (SATURN) trial, an ongoing randomized trial comparing rosuvastatin to placebo in HIV-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy. Plasma sclerostin was measured at study entry by ELISA from participants with available samples. Spearman correlation and multivariable linear regression were used to test relationships between sclerostin and bone density or bone turnover and cardiovascular disease. Among 139 HIV-infected participants (median age 46 years, CD4 lymphocyte count 614 cells/μl), the median plasma sclerostin level was 444.1 (IQR 330.3, 570.1) pg/ml. Correlations were detected between sclerostin and age (r=0.26), lumbar spine Z-score (r=0.31), RANKL (r=-0.21), carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT, r=0.19), and sVCAM-1 (r=0.27), p<0.05. No significant correlations were detected between sclerostin and current (r=0.006) or nadir CD4 count (r=0.11). While associations between sclerostin, lumbar spine Z-score, and sVCAM-1 were robust to covariate adjustment (p<0.01), association with CIMT was no longer significant (p=0.08). Our findings provide preliminary support for a relationship between sclerostin and bone mineral density in HIV-infected persons. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway should be investigated as a potential mechanism for loss of bone mineral density in treated HIV infection. "
13503,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The lung represents a potential target during HIV infection, and the onset of AIDS is associated with severe pulmonary complications in many patients. T-lymphocytes and alveolar macrophages form the majority of HIV-infected cells in the lung. However, other cell types in the lung could participate in HIV-mediated lung pathology and their role has not been investigated. The aims of this study were to determine if human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMEC) express HIV receptor and coreceptors, and if HIV can directly infect HLMEC. Specifically, we wished to determine if these cells constitute a viral reservoir in the lung, and if HIV-1 envelope proteins induce cytotoxic effects on HLMEC. Our results showed that by flow cytometry, HLMEC failed to express any CXCR4 or CCR5 on their surface. In contrast, RT-PCR revealed the presence of CXCR4 and CCR5 mRNA, but not CD4 in HLMEC. Two dual-tropic HIV-1 isolates failed to infect HLMEC in vitro, as determined by (1) p24 antigen capture ELISA, (2) reverse transcriptase assay, RT-PCR, and (3) DNA PCR. However, a recombinant HIV-1 gp120 preparation induced apoptotic cell death of HLMEC. These data support the hypothesis that no productive HIV-1 infection of HLMEC occurs in vitro. This suggests that in vivo, HLMEC may not be a major reservoir of HIV in the lung and the primary route for HIV invasion of the lung. Thus, while other mechanisms must play a role in HIV invasion and subsequent dissemination in the lung, lung endothelial cells do represent potential targets for the lethal effects of HIV viral proteins."

IL28B SNPs were genotyped in 269 patients, 181 mono- and 88 co-infected, treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Data stratified by HCV mono- and HCV/HIV co-infected patients showed that 58% and 31% of the rs12979860CC carriers and 49% and 21% of the rs8099917TT carriers had SVR. IL28B SNPs, HCV mono-infection and HCV RNA load were associated with SVR as independent predictors in the two study groups as a whole. ROC curve analyses in the two populations separately, based on gender, age, baseline HCV RNA load and rs12979860/rs8099917 revealed similar receiver operating characteristics (ROC) areas under the curve values. Combining the determination of IL28B SNPs, rs8099917 genotyping improved the response prediction in rs12979860CT carriers only in mono-infected patients. In the era of direct-acting antiviral agents, adopting SVR baseline predictors to orientate naïve-patient management represents an important issue. A model involving IL28B SNPs appears able to predict SVR in both populations. "

Patients who can access and adhere to combination therapy should be able to achieve durable, potentially lifelong suppression of HIV replication. Despite the unquestioned success of antiretroviral therapy, limitations persist. Treatment success needs strict lifelong drug adherence. Although the widely used drugs are generally well tolerated, most have some short-term toxic effects and all have the potential for both known and unknown long-term toxic effects. Drug and administration costs limit treatment in resource-poor regions, and are a growing concern even in resource rich settings. Finally, complete or near complete control of viral replication does not fully restore health. Long-term treated patients who are on an otherwise effective regimen often show persistent immune dysfunction and have higher than expected risk for various non-AIDS-related complications, including heart, bone, liver, kidney, and neurocognitive diseases."
4310,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Today, combination antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin (RBV) allows many patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) to achieve a sustained virological response, which is equivalent to cure. Data also support the clinical benefit of combination antiviral therapy in patients coinfected with HCV and HIV, and in patients who have received a liver transplant. Antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha and RBV is, however, associated with a high incidence and significant magnitude of anemia. This anemia may have several mechanisms, including bone marrow suppression and hemolysis. In addition, patients coinfected with HIV may have both pre-existing and RBV-associated anemia. Management of anemia in patients with HCV through RBV dose reduction or treatment discontinuation may compromise the effectiveness of treatment, because studies have demonstrated that treatment adherence or maintenance of antiviral therapy dose is an important predictor of sustained virological response. Anemia associated with combination antiviral therapy in patients with HCV is frequently associated with an inadequate or blunted endogenous erythropoietin response. Accumulating evidence now supports the use of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) to manage anemia in these patients, with the objective of maintaining the RBV dose, but clinical standards are lacking. The present article reviews the data relevant to the use of rHuEpo in this patient population and proposes a set of clinical practice standards to assist clinicians in selecting patients for rHuEpo and in implementing rHuEpo therapy effectively."

Important limitations of these studies included a low incidence of cardiovascular events, short duration of HAART exposure, and retrospective design. Nevertheless, the weight of evidence from observational and surrogate end point studies suggests that the dyslipidemia and other metabolic changes that are common in patients with HIV infection and those using HAART may be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The Infectious Disease Society of America/Adults AIDS Clinical Trials Group guidelines for the evaluation and management of dyslipidemia recommend target lipid levels and treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with HIV infection. Although practitioners should consider dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk when making plans for initiating or altering HAART therapy, maintaining viremic control should be the overriding factor, because short-term absolute rates of cardiovascular disease are significantly lower than death rates from AIDS in inadequately suppressed patients. This article reviews the cardiovascular risks in patients receiving HAART and discusses the implementation of the new guidelines."
5487,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Numerous alterations in endocrine function are observed in HIV infection. Direct destruction of endocrine organs by HIV itself or by invasive infection with opportunistic organisms resulting in loss of function is rare. When acutely ill, HIV patients can develop the metabolic derangements that accompany any severe systemic disorder. Studies of thyroid function tests emphasize that the presence of acute secondary infection must be analyzed when evaluating such patients. In addition to euthyroid sick syndrome other hormonal axes are affected by severe illness. These alterations may be cytokine mediated. As with seronegative patients, these changes can be transient and resolve with successful treatment of the intervening illness. Given the complexity of HIV disease, future reports should characterize patients by CD4 cell count, history of AIDS-indicating illnesses, and viral load. Viral burden is an independent predictor of immunosuppression and progression to AIDS. A large number of medications used in the treatment of HIV infection and related illnesses can alter endocrine function, mineral and electrolyte balance, and substrate turnover. Drug therapy must be considered in the evaluation of endocrine abnormalities in HIV-infected patients and carefully characterized in studies of these patients. The endocrine effects of medications used in the treatment of HIV infection are summarized in Table 3. Concomitant factors that affect endocrine function independent of the HIV virus can confound results in these patients. For example, opiate use affects PRL, gonadotropins, and cortisol response to ACTH stimulation. Investigations in HIV-infected patients must include careful descriptions of the study population and comparison to relevant controls. HIV-infected patients may also demonstrate more subtle alterations in endocrinological function in early, relatively asymptomatic, stages. The etiology and clinical significance of these changes, particularly their relationship to cytokines, continues to be investigated. The sequential studies of stable aldosterone levels despite decreased aldosterone response to ACTH stimulation indicate that alterations in response to provocative testing do not predict the development of hormonal insufficiency in this patient population. Similar longitudinal studies need to be done for the other hormonal axes to further delineate the endocrinological alterations in HIV infection. Finally, when the rationale for hormone replacement is debatable, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are necessary. Transient improvement in clinical status during open-label treatment does not prove hormone insufficiency. The long-term efficacy and safety of hormonal therapy must be demonstrated."

Three groups of patients receiving TDF > 12 months were recruited: 194 HIV-infected patients, 85 HIV-HBV-coinfected patients and 50 HBV-infected patients. eGFR was estimated using the Modification of the Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Multivariate regression models were constructed to estimate factors associated with eGFR decrease from baseline. A total of 329 patients were studied. Median follow-up was 2.7 years. Median eGFR decrease was -4.9 (-16.6 to +7.2) mL/min/1.73 m(2) . After multivariate stepwise regression analysis, age (P = 0.0002), non-African origin (P < 0.0001), baseline eGFR (P < 0.0001) and TDF duration (P = 0.02) were associated with eGFR decrease in the whole population, while hypertension, diabetes and type of infection were not. Age (P < 0.0001), non-African origin (P = 0.0004), baseline eGFR (P < 0.0001) and TDF duration (P = 0.007) remained associated with eGFR decline in HIV and HIV-HBV-infected patients, while other variables including HIV risk factor, CDC stage, CD4 and HIV-RNA levels were not. Age (P = 0.03), non-African origin (P = 0.004), baseline eGFR (P < 0.0001) and baseline HBV-DNA > 2000 IU/mL (P = 0.04) were associated with eGFR decline in HBV and HIV-HBV-infected patients, while other variables including HBV risk factor and fibrosis stage were not. Estimated glomerular filtration rate decline under TDF therapy appears mainly associated with older age, non-African origin, higher baseline eGFR and longer TDF administration but not with the type of viral infection. Regular follow-up of renal function, especially tubular function is recommended during TDF therapy."
2962,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus-associated neurological disease (HAND) still causes significant morbidity, despite success reducing viral loads with combination antiretroviral therapy. The dopamine (DA) system is particularly vulnerable in HAND. We hypothesize that early, ""reversible"" DAergic synaptic dysfunction occurs long before DAergic neuron loss. As such, aging human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals may be vulnerable to other age-related neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD), underscoring the need to understand shared molecular targets in HAND and PD. Previously, we reported that the neurotoxic HIV-1 transactivating factor (Tat) acutely disrupts mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis via ryanodine receptor (RyR) activation. Here, we further report that Tat disrupts DA transporter (DAT) activity and function, resulting in increased plasma membrane (PM) DAT and increased DAT V(max), without changes in K(m) or total DAT protein. Tat also increases calpain protease activity at the PM, demonstrated by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy of a cleavable fluorescent calpain substrate. Tat-increased PM DAT and calpain activity are blocked by the RyR antagonists ryanodine and dantrolene, the calpain inhibitor calpastatin, and by a specific inhibitor of GSK-3β. We conclude that Tat activates RyRs via a calcium- and calpain-mediated mechanism that upregulates DAT trafficking to the PM, and is independent of DAT protein synthesis, reinforcing the feasibility of RyR and GSK-3β inhibition as clinical therapeutic approaches for HAND. Finally, we provide key translational relevance for these findings by highlighting published human data of increased DAT levels in striata of HAND patients and by demonstrating similar findings in Tat-expressing transgenic mice."

We performed a retrospective study among patients with HIV to evaluate the incidence and risk factors for VTEs during the HAART era. A literature review was performed examining VTEs in the pre- and post-HAART eras. Seventeen (3.7%) of 465 patients with HIV experienced a VTE. The overall incidence rate of deep VTEs among HIV-positive persons was 377 cases per 100,000 person-years, a fourfold higher rate compared to age-matched males in the general population. The median age at VTE was 36 years (range, 27-68). Patients with a thrombosis compared to those without had significantly lower current CD4 (153 versus 520 cells/mm(3), p < 0.001) and nadir (76 versus 276 cells/mm(3), p < 0.001) CD4 counts, higher viral loads (3.6 versus 1.7 log(10) copies per milliliter, p = 0.003), and more likely to have a diagnosis of AIDS (76% versus 32%, p < 0.001); there were no differences in demographics, hyperlipidemia, current use of HAART, the duration of HAART or protease inhibitor (PI) exposure. A review of the literature noted 129 VTE cases; mean age was 40 years, mean CD4 count was 181 cells/mm(3), the majority of patients were not receiving HAART, and the most common risk factor was an ongoing infection. Thrombotic events are occurring among patients with HIV despite their relatively young ages. Advanced HIV disease is a risk factor for development of thromboses, possibly due to an increased inflammatory state or the presence of concurrent comorbidities such as infections. HAART or PI therapy does not appear to play a significant role in the occurrence of VTEs."

The most common manifestations are arthralgia and the spectrum of spondyloarthropathies, but distinct entities such as HIV-associated arthritis and the painful articular syndrome have also been reported. Although initial reports described patients with mainly asymmetric oligoarthritis, a polyarticular presentation is now seen frequently. In Caucasians, HIV-associated reactive arthritis resembles reactive arthritis in non-HIV-infected persons. Reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy were uncommon in Africa and are now detected more often with the HIV epidemic. Although early reports in Western communities reported asymmetrical oligoarthritis as the usual pattern, polyarticular involvement is now seen frequently. Intravenous drug abuse is the most likely risk factor for septic arthritis, even in HIV-infected persons in Western communities, while HIV infection itself may be more important in developing countries where most patients do not receive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Recent reports have drawn attention to the development of avascular necrosis of the bone in HIV-positive patients and the risk factors include HAART itself, complications of HAART, HIV infection per se or concomitant conventional risk factors. Many patients respond to conventional symptomatic therapy, and disease-modifying drug therapy is necessary for patients who have persistent and progressive arthritis.

In the follow-up survey which started in June 1988, members of the same study population were revisited and studied in order to determine the incidence of HIV-1 infection among those who were HIV seronegative in the initial survey. HIV serology was conducted by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and all positive sera were confirmed by the Western blot technique. A total population of 1316 adults aged 15-54 years was studied, constituting an average follow-up response rate of 69% in the rural areas and of 59% in the urban area. The overall incidence of HIV-1 infection among the adult population sample was 13.7 per 1000 person-years at risk with the highest incidence in the urban zone (47.5 per 1000 person-years at risk) and the lowest incidence in one of the three rural zones (4.9 per 1000 person-years at risk). The age-specific annual incidence was highest in the age group 25-34 years for males and in the age group 15-24 for females.

Twenty-five percent of the surgeons sustained yearly injury rates of 9 or more per 1000 operating room hours, and these high rates were independent of sex, age, type of practice, operative work load, or hospital location. Fifty-three percent of all injuries involved the index finger of the nondominant hand. If the prevalence of HIV infection in surgical patients is 5%, then the estimated 30-year risk of HIV seroconversion is less than 1% for 50% of the group, 1% to 2% for 25% of the group, 2% to 6% for 15% of the surgeons, and greater than 6% for 10% of the surgeons."
2767,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"A nationwide survey of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated economic burden has not previously been performed in China. The purpose of this study was to examine the direct, indirect, and intangible costs of HBV-related diseases within the span of one year. A random sample was taken from specialty and general hospitals across 12 cities in six provinces of China. Intangible costs were estimated based on willingness to pay or open-ended answers provided by patients. The results showed that 27 hospitals were enrolled, with a sample population of 4726 patients (77.7% response rate). The average annual costs were $4454.0 (direct), $924.3 (indirect), and $6611.10 (intangible), corresponding to 37.3%, 7.7%, and 55.1% of the total costs, respectively. The direct medical fees were substantially greater than the non-medical fees. Annual indirect costs were divided into outpatient ($112.9) and inpatient ($811.40) loss of income. The intangible costs of chronic HBV were notably higher than either the direct or indirect costs, consistent with the social stigma in China. The comparison amongst individual cities for the average ratio of direct to indirect costs revealed that the sizes of ratios were negatively correlated with the socioeconomic status of the regions. This study suggested that as a whole in China, the HBV-related diseases caused a heavy financial burden which was positively associated with disease severity. Although the intangible costs coincided with a high prevalence of discrimination against CHB patients in Chinese society, our study may serve as future reference for detailed exploration. "

Two hundred and thirty-two subjects (193 men, 39 women; median age 32) participated; a response rate of 89%. Clients were long-term, frequent injectors. Lending used equipment at any time was reported by 55%, and borrowing by 52%. Of those who had shared needles and syringes during the last year, the majority had lent to, or borrowed from, one person only (53 and 55%, respectively). Younger clients (less than 29 years of age) reported more recent sharing than older clients (greater than 30 years of age). Five out of 211 (2.4%) samples tested for anti-HIV were positive. One hundred and eleven out of 199 (56%) samples were positive for anti-hepatitis B core (HBc). In this population of needle-exchange attenders there is no evidence of further spread of HIV, and a low prevalence of HIV infection appears to have been sustained. However, the high prevalence of anti-HBc provides evidence of previous risk behaviour and so constant vigilance is necessary if further viral spread is to be avoided. This study has established an acceptable method for the anonymous surveillance of current risk behaviour and salivary antibodies to HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in a drug-using population."

In Indonesia, 4.6% of the population was positive for HBsAg in 1994 and of these, 21% were positive for HBeAg and 73% for anti-HBe; 44% and 45% of Indonesian patients with cirrhosis and HCC, respectively, were HBsAg positive. In the Philippines, there appear to be two types of age-specific HBsAg prevalence, suggesting different modes of transmission. In Thailand, 8-10% of males and 6-8% of females are HBsAg positive, with HBsAg also found in 30% of patients with cirrhosis and 50-75% of those with HCC. In Taiwan, 75-80% of patients with chronic liver disease are HBsAg positive, and HBsAg is found in 34% and 72% of patients with cirrhosis and HCC, respectively. In China, 73% of patients with chronic hepatitis and 78% and 71% of those with cirrhosis and HCC, respectively, are HBsAg positive. In Singapore, the prevalence of HBsAg has dropped since the introduction of HBV vaccination and the HBsAg seroprevalence of unvaccinated individuals over 5 years of age is 4.5%. In Malaysia, 5.24% of healthy volunteers, with a mean age of 34 years, were positive for HBsAg in 1997. In the highly endemic countries in Asia, the majority of infections are contracted postnatally or perinatally. Three phases of chronic HBV infection are recognized: phase 1 patients are HBeAg positive with high levels of virus in the serum and minimal hepatic inflammation; phase 2 patients have intermittent or continuous hepatitis of varying degrees of severity; phase 3 is the inactive phase during which viral concentrations are low and there is minimal inflammatory activity in the liver. In general, patients who clear HBeAg have a better prognosis than patients who remain HBeAg-positive for prolonged periods of time. The outcome after anti-HBe seroconversion depends on the degree of pre-existing liver damage and any subsequent HBV reactivation. Without pre-existing cirrhosis, there may be only slight fibrosis or mild chronic hepatitis, but with pre-existing cirrhosis, further complications may ensue. HBsAg-negative chronic hepatitis B is a phase of chronic HBV infection during which a mutation arises resulting in the inability of the virus to produce HBeAg. Such patients tend to have more severe liver disease and run a more rapidly progressive course. The annual probability of developing cirrhosis varies from 0.1 to 1.0% depending on the duration of HBV replication, the severity of disease and the presence of concomitant infections or drugs. The annual incidence of hepatic decompensation in HBV-related cirrhosis varies from 2 to 10% and in these patients the 5-year survival rate drops dramatically to 14-35%. The annual risk of developing HCC in patients with cirrhosis varies between 1 and 6%; the overall reported annual detection rate of HCC in surveillance studies, which included individuals with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis, is 0.8-4.1%. Chronic hepatitis B is not a static disease and the natural history of the disease is affected by both viral and host factors. The prognosis is poor with decompensated cirrhosis and effective treatment options are limited. Prevention of HBV infection thorough vaccination is still, therefore, the best strategy for decreasing the incidence of hepatitis B-associated cirrhosis and HCC."

We surveyed 142 rural Ethiopian HIV patients newly enrolled in care for perceived social support and factors associated with low support levels. Using the Social Provisions Scale (SPS), the mean summary score was 19.1 (possible scores = 0-48). On six SPS subscales, mean scores (possible scores = 0-8), were: Reliable Alliance (others can be counted on for tangible assistance) = 2.8, Attachment (emotional closeness providing sense of security) = 2.9, Reassurance of Worth (recognition of competence and value by others) = 3.2, Guidance (provision of advice or information by others) = 3.2, Social Integration (belonging to a group with similar interests and concerns) = 3.5, and Nurturance (belief that others rely on one for their well-being) = 3.6. In multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with lower social support scores were: lower education level (did not complete primary school) (p = .019), lower total score on knowledge items about HIV care/treatment (p = .038), and greater number of external stigma experiences in past three months (p < .001); greater number of chronic disease symptoms was of borderline significance (p = .098). Among rural Ethiopian patients newly entering HIV care, we found moderate and varying levels of perceived social support, with lowest scores for subscales reflecting emotional closeness and reliance on others for tangible assistance. Given that patients who have recently learned their diagnosis and entered care may be an especially vulnerable group, programs to help identify and address social support needs can provide multiple benefits in facilitating the best possible physical, emotional and functional quality of life for people living with HIV.

Despite this critical need, many do not follow prescribed regimens. To examine the barriers that lead to non-adherence, we used cross-sectional survey data from a randomized controlled intervention trial in northern and north-eastern Thailand. Of the 507 patients that were enrolled in the trial, we analyzed 386 patients on antiretroviral therapy in order to examine the barriers to adherence. In addition to demographic characteristics, depressive symptoms, physical health, access to care, social support, and internalized shame, HIV disclosure and family communication were examined. The correlation analysis revealed that adherence is significantly associated with internalized shame, access to care, depressive symptoms, and family communication. Based on the multiple logistic regression analysis, depressive symptoms, access to care, HIV disclosure, and family communication were significant predictors of adherence. Having depressive symptoms remains a significant barrier to adherence, while access to care, HIV disclosure, and family communication play important positive roles. Our findings underscore the critical importance of addressing these various challenges that can influence adherence to antiretroviral therapy."

Susceptible IDU subjects (187 seronegative for antibody to HCV, and 460 seronegative for core antibody to HBV) were identified in drug treatment, corrections, and social service agencies from June 1994 to January 1996, and followed for seroconversion one year later. The subjects included in the analysis were Seattle-King County (Washington State) area IDUs enrolled in a larger multipurpose cohort study, the Risk Activity Variables, Epidemiology, and Network Study (RAVEN Study). There were 39 HCV infections (20.9/100/year) and 46 HBV infections (10.0/100/year). There was no apparent protective effect of syringe exchange against HBV (former exchange users, relative risk (RR) = 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-2.5; sporadic exchange users, RR = 2.4, 95% CI 0.9-6.5; regular users, RR = 1.81, 95% CI 0.7-4.8; vs. RR = 1.0 for nonusers of the exchange; adjusted for daily drug injection). Neither did the exchange protect against HCV infection (sporadic users, RR = 2.6, 95% CI 0.8-8.5; regular users, RR = 1.3, 95% CI 0.8-2.2; vs. RR = 1.0 for nonusers; adjusted for recent onset of injection and syringe sharing prior to enrollment). While it is possible that uncontrolled confounding or other bias obscured a true beneficial impact of exchange use, these data suggest that no such benefit occurred during the period of the study."

Pretreatment characteristics were well balanced between the placebo and drug-treated groups, including CD4 distributions, types of clotting disorders, transaminase abnormalities, and use of various hemostatic agents. At the time of analysis, 161 patients either were still receiving treatment or had previously reached an endpoint of disease progression while receiving treatment. Twenty-five patients withdrew voluntarily. The toxic effects noted included granulocytopenia and anemia, especially in older patients, and subjective symptoms of asthenia, malaise, and nausea, consistent with the known consequences of treatment with 300 mg ZDV five times daily. There was a trend toward more diagnoses of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), advanced or early AIDS-related complex (ARC), single ARC symptoms, or death in placebo recipients as compared with those receiving ZDV (22 v 13). Because older patients with hemophilia have more rapid disease progression, the same efficacy analysis was performed in the 89 patients aged more than 30 years who were receiving treatment. In this subgroup, there was a similar trend (11 v 6). With regard to the most advanced problems of the infection among the older patients, there were five patients who were newly diagnosed with AIDS or died in the placebo group versus none in the ZDV group (P = .02) among the older patients. The pretreatment distribution of CD4 counts for the placebo and ZDV groups were similar, but patients aged more than 30 years had significantly (P less than .049) fewer CD4 cells than patients aged less than 30 years. A beneficial ZDV effect is also supported by a trend toward higher CD4 counts (a 48-cell increase in the ZDV group at 24 weeks as compared with a four-cell increase in the placebo group) and a significant (P = .03) difference in weight gain in the ZDV patients aged more than 30 years (8 pounds) as compared with the older placebo patients (aged more than 30 years) (2 pounds) at week 24. The findings in the asymptomatic hemophilic patients aged more than 30 years support a useful effect of ZDV, which is similar to observations in the larger study of its use in asymptomatic, nonhemophilic patients."

Overall, 108 (52.2%) patients had at least one oral lesion. The most common oral manifestation of HIV infection among these 207 patients was oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL, 29.5%), followed by candidiasis (12.1%), xerostomia (10.6%), aphthous ulcers (8.7%), and linear gingival erythema (5.8%). Less frequently encountered oral lesions included leukoplakia (1.9%), papilloma (1.4%), necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (1.0%), Kaposi's sarcoma (1.0%), herpes simplex (0.5%), Burkitt's lymphoma (0.5%), and parotid gland enlargement (0.5%). Thirty-one (15%) patients had multiple oral lesions. Patients with oral candidiasis or multiple oral lesions had significantly lower mean CD4 lymphocyte counts and CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratios than those without any oral lesions (p < 0.05). Chi-square analysis revealed that patients with CD4 lymphocyte counts below 200 cells/mm3 were more prone to have OHL (p < 0.002), oral candidiasis (p < 0.001) and multiple oral lesions (p < 0.001). Those with CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratios below 0.4 were more likely to have OHL (p < 0.02), oral candidiasis (p < 0.01) and multiple oral lesions (p < 0.02) than those with higher counts. In conclusion, the occurrence of oral lesions, especially OHL and oral candidiasis, is fairly common in Taiwanese HIV-infected patients."

Immune reconstitution-associated diseases (IRADs) are common and important consequences of HAART. Dermatologists should be aware of the cutaneous manifestations of IRAD. The prevalence of clinical human papillomavirus (HPV)-related disease is increased in HIV and does not appear to be diminished by HAART. Many patients on HAART are dogged by persistent cutaneous warts. Anogenital precancer is also common in HIV and may be burgeoning with HAART. Clinicians should be aware of the increased risk of cervical, penile and vulval/vaginal cancers in treated and untreated patients with HIV. The increase in HPV infection in HIV-infected individuals may be, at least partly, due to increased exposure to diverse HPV types, particularly high-risk types that might be able to persist for longer in anogenital regions. Alternatively, persistent/emergent HPV disease in HIV infection might represent persistent or modulated immunodysregulation after HAART and be viewed as a form of IRAD. The immunopathogenesis of HPV IRAD is fascinating and possibly determined by host genotype."

This review focuses on estimations of prevalence by geographic region and identification of high-risk populations within each region, outcome for trauma patients with HIV and AIDS and risk management for health care workers who sustain occupational exposures. Trauma surgeons are more likely to encounter patients infected with HIV in geographic areas where HIV prevalence is high or in areas where intravenous drug use, high-risk sexual behaviours and penetrating trauma are more common. Patients with HIV may be expected to have higher rates of infectious and respiratory complications if they have active AIDS and/or liver disease caused by one of the hepatitis viruses. Certain aspects of therapy may change in this group of patients. Clinicians should be aware that highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) might produce complications. Occupational exposure among healthcare workers is uncommon. Cases of infection in healthcare workers from needlesticks are rare. Certain precautions regarding body fluid and needlestick exposures have been widely adopted over the past decade. When percutaneous injury results in known exposure to HIV, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) should be used and can be expected to be effective in preventing infection in the large majority of cases."
2426,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of 10 SNPs in different microRNAs (miRNAs) with susceptibility to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HBV clearance, persistence of chronic HBV infection, and progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients were categorized into the following groups: inactive HBV carrier, active HBV carrier, HBV-cleared subject and cirrhosis+HCC. Samples were analysed for 10 SNPs in microRNAs using either PCR-based genotyping or the TaqMan assay. We found that rs1358379 was associated with susceptibility to HBV infection, HBV clearance, persistent chronic HBV infection and liver cirrhosis+HCC. In addition, we found that rs2292832 and rs11614913 were associated with risk of HBV infection, viral clearance and cirrhosis+HCC, whereas rs2910164 was associated with proneness to HBV infection, and ability to clear the virus. There was evidence of associations between rs6505162 and HBV clearance and the development of liver disease, whereas a single association was found between rs2289030 and HBV clearance. Similarly, rs7372209 and rs4919510 were specifically associated with the development of HBV-induced liver complications. SNPs in miRNAs affect the susceptibility, clearance and progression of HBV infection in Saudi Arabian patients. We found, using Gene Ontology or pathway analyses, that these genes may contribute to the pathophysiology of HBV infection and related liver complications. However, differences in the association of examined SNPs with various clinical stages indicate variations in the respective functional roles of these polymorphisms and their miRNAs, and thus, further investigation to fully explore their therapeutic potential is warranted."
16196,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Effective prophylaxis for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is important for health care providers at risk for exposure to infected blood. The average risk from percutaneous exposure is approximately 0.3%, but exposures involving a high titer of HIV or a large volume of infections material are apt to be much riskier. A convergence of indirect evidence strongly suggests that chemoprophylaxis with zidovudine after exposure to HIV may be efficacious. Treatment with zidovudine after percutaneous exposure appears to reduce the odds of infection by almost 80%. Zidovudine prophylaxis effectively prevents perinatal HIV transmission, and treatment during acute retroviral infection may attenuate HIV disease. Reports of ""aborted"" HIV infection among health care providers who have been stuck with contaminated needles suggest that antiretroviral treatment in the window of opportunity after exposure to HIV could prevent virus propagation and allow local cutaneous host defenses to clear the infection. Although efficacy has not been shown in controlled clinical trials, these data support a potential benefit from treatment after exposure. It is difficult to define the optimal regiment that should be used for prophyaxis, given the emergence of antiretroviral resistance among source patients. Current recommendations favor the use of zidovudine plus lamivudine for 4 weeks. Use of indinavir or other protease inhibitors is advised when the source patient is likely to harbor resistant virus or when exposure is especially hazardous."
9234,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Successful combination therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has transformed this disease from a short-lived infection with high mortality to a chronic disease associated with increasing life expectancy. This is true for high- as well as low- and middle-income countries. As a result of this increased life expectancy, people living with HIV are now at risk of developing other chronic diseases associated with aging. Heart failure has been common among people living with HIV in the eras of pre- and post- availability of antiretroviral therapy; however, our current understanding of the pathogenesis and approaches to management have not been systematically addressed. HIV may cause heart failure through direct (e.g., viral replication, mitochondrial dysfunction, cardiac autoimmunity, autonomic dysfunction) and indirect (e.g., opportunistic infections, antiretroviral therapy, alcohol abuse, micronutrient deficiency, tobacco use) pathways. In low- and middle-income countries, 2 large observational studies have recently reported clinical characteristics and outcomes in these patients. HIV-associated heart failure remains a common cardiac diagnosis in people living with heart failure, yet a unifying set of diagnostic criteria is lacking. Treatment patterns for heart failure fall short of society guidelines. Although there may be promise in cardiac glycosides for treating heart failure in people living with HIV, clinical studies are needed to validate in vitro findings. Owing to the burden of HIV in low- and middle-income countries and the concurrent rise of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, strategic and concerted efforts in this area are likely to impact the care of people living with HIV around the globe."
18634,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Treating HIV-infected patients with a combination of several antiretroviral drugs usually contributes to a substantial decline in viral load and an increase in CD4(+) T cells. However, continuing viral replication in the presence of drug therapy can lead to the emergence of drug-resistant virus variants, which subsequently results in incomplete viral suppression and a greater risk of disease progression. In this paper, we use a simple mathematical model to study the mechanism of the emergence of drug resistance during therapy. The model includes two viral strains: wild-type and drug-resistant. The wild-type strain can mutate and become drug-resistant during the process of reverse transcription. The reproductive ratio [Symbol: see text](0) for each strain is obtained and stability results of the steady states are given. We show that drug-resistant virus is more likely to arise when, in the presence of antiretroviral treatment, the reproductive ratios of both strains are close. The wild-type virus can be suppressed even when the reproductive ratio of this strain is greater than 1. A pharmacokinetic model including blood and cell compartments is employed to estimate the drug efficacies of both the wild-type and the drug-resistant strains. We investigate how time-varying drug efficacy (due to the drug dosing schedule and suboptimal adherence) affects the antiviral response, particularly the emergence of drug resistance. Simulation results suggest that perfect adherence to regimen protocol will well suppress the viral load of the wild-type strain while drug-resistant variants develop slowly. However, intermediate levels of adherence may result in the dominance of the drug-resistant virus several months after the initiation of therapy. When more doses of drugs are missed, the failure of suppression of the wild-type virus will be observed, accompanied by a relatively slow increase in the drug-resistant viral load."
11004,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The natural course of perinatally acquired hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has three phases. In the first 'immune tolerance phase', patients are HBeAg positive and have high serum levels of HBV DNA, but have no symptoms, normal ALT levels and minimal histological activity. The second 'immune clearance phase' usually occurs between 15 and 35 years of age, during which HBV replication declines, accompanied by increased serum ALT levels and inflammatory activity in the liver; HBeAg to anti-HBe seroconversion is then observed, frequently preceded by a flare of the ALT level. The average rate of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion is 10% per year. In the third 'low-replicative phase', serum HBsAg persists, but HBeAg is no longer detectable and HBV DNA can only be detected by PCR assay. During this phase, patients are usually asymptomatic and liver disease is inactive; some patients, however, may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The ultimate outcome of chronic HBV infection appears to depend on the duration and severity of liver injury during the immune clearance phase. About 2.1% of patients with chronic type B hepatitis develop cirrhosis each year. Patients who have a severe acute exacerbation complicated by subacute hepatic failure or who have recurrent episodes of acute exacerbations with bridging hepatic necrosis are more likely to develop cirrhosis. A significant proportion of those with HBsAg eventually develop HCC; they have a 100-fold increased risk of HCC relative to those without. The development of HCC, however, is closely related to the severity of the underlying liver disease. The annual incidence of HCC is only 0.1% in asymptomatic HBsAg individual, 1% in patients with chronic hepatitis B, but increases to 3-10% in patients with cirrhosis. Some anti-HBe-positive patients continue to have active liver disease and they should be tested for HBV DNA by hybridization assay to determine whether the disease results from replicative precore mutant HBV infection or other causes of liver disease, such as superinfection with HCV and HDV. A substantial number of apparently healthy HBV-infected individuals are first recognized when they present with episodes of acute hepatitis. About 30% of these cases could be attributed to other hepatotropic virus superinfection. Acute viral hepatitis in patients with concurrent HBV infection is associated with an increased risk of fulminant hepatic failure. Finally, HBsAg disappears from serum in about 1% of patients each year. HCV superinfection can enhance the termination of HBsAg positivity. HCV, however, replaces HBV as the dominant cause of chronic viral hepatitis. The outcome of HBV-infected persons with 'spontaneous' seroclearance of HBsAg is usually favourable, though progress to cirrhosis and HCC is still possible."

CSF beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin levels were significantly lower in those who had been taking ZDV for an intermediate period of time (46-365 days) than in those who had received ZDV either long term (> 365 days) or short term (1-45 days). CSF quinolinic acid levels were independent of duration of ZDV administration. A second CSF evaluation was available after 1 year for 54 HIV-positive men (19 of whom were also in the first cohort) and 11 HIV-negative controls. Patients who had started ZDV between lumbar punctures showed a significant decrease in CSF beta 2-microglobulin, but in those who had been receiving ZDV for > 1 year beta 2-microglobulin increased (p = 0.001). The effect was not observed with neopterin (p = 0.14). (Quinolinic acid levels were not studied longitudinally.) Finally, we observed that CSF levels of beta 2-microglobulin, neopterin, and quinolinic acid correlated strongly with each other in HIV-positive individuals (r = 0.7, p < 0.0001), even though ZDV might have different effects on these markers. In conclusion, we report that initiation of ZDV therapy is associated with a transient decrease in CSF levels of beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

FPDs all have an approximate time of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection during the mid-1990s. Few studies about the natural history of HIV infection in these patients were performed. The current study focuses on characterizing the duration of asymptomatic infection as well as the time to disease and mortality of infected FPDs in China. A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on data collected from 5484 HIV-1 infected FPDs in Shangcai county, Henan province. Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied to estimate the asymptomatic duration from the time of infection to the onset of AIDS as well as the survival period from the onset of AIDS to the time of death. The estimated median asymptomatic phase was about 9.21 years, which is similar to that reported in other developing countries in Africa. The estimated median life span after the onset of symptoms was about 9.91 months, which is notably shorter than life spans reported elsewhere. This is the first large-scale retrospective study on the natural history of HIV infection in FPDs in rural China. The findings not only provide valuable insight into an understudied population, but should also serve as an important reference for patient management and care."

To identify viral factors associated with the HCV treatment response, we analyzed the pretreatment NS3/4A protease gene quasispecies composition of 56 HCV genotype 1-HIV-1-coinfected patients treated in our clinic with pegylated IFN (pegIFN) plus ribavirin (RBV). The catalytic efficiency of the dominant (i.e., the most abundant) quasispecies was also assayed for Cardif cleavage and correlated with treatment outcome. A total of 1,745 clones were isolated and sequenced. Significantly less nucleotide quasispecies heterogeneity and lower Shannon entropy values were detected within the responder group (P < 0.05). A correlation was also found between the efficiency of NS3/4A protease Cardif cleavage and therapy outcome. Proteases from sustained responder patients were more efficient at processing Cardif (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM], 0.8960 ± 0.05568; n = 19) than proteases from nonresponders (mean ± SEM, 0.7269 ± 0.05306; n = 37; P < 0.05). Finally, the amino acid p distance (the proportion [p] of nucleotide sites at which two sequences being compared are different) was significantly shorter in patients with an interleukin-28B (IL-28B) risk allele (P < 0.01), suggesting that IL-28B risk allele carriers exert a lower positive selection pressure on the NS3/4A protease. NS3/4A protease efficiency in cleaving Cardif may be associated with the pegIFN-RBV treatment response, as shown in our cohort of HIV-HCV-coinfected patients. Greater NS3/4A nucleotide heterogeneity and higher Shannon entropy values in nonresponders suggest that less HCV quasispecies complexity may favor a better response to pegIFN-RBV."

Recovery from anemia has been linked to improved survival outcomes. Blood transfusion has been associated with accelerated disease progression and mortality in patients with HIV infection, and review of related literature suggests that the mechanism for negative transfusion-associated outcomes may be transfusion-related immunosuppression. Therefore, the use of transfusion should be restricted to patients with acute or severe anemia. Prescription of epoetin alfa has been associated with increased survival in an observational cohort among patients with HIV infection and anemia. In the absence of data from a clinical trial documenting the effect of treating anemia on survival, clinicians should consider non-transfusion options for management of anemia on the basis of clinical status and patient functional ability."

Here, we show that viral phenotypes and antibody responses differ considerably between individual cohort members, despite the single source of infection. Replication of isolated virus varied from barely detectable to similar to that of the wild-type virus, and virus isolated from five SBBC members showed coreceptor usage signatures unique to each individual. Higher viral loads and stronger neutralizing antibody responses were associated with better-replicating viral strains, and detectable viral replication was essential for the development of strong and sustained humoral immune responses. Despite the presence of strong neutralizing antibodies in a number of SBBC members, disease progression was not prevented, and each cohort member studied displayed a unique outcome of infection with nef-attenuated HIV-1."

The clinical diagnosis of herpes zoster was verified by examination of blister cell and fluid material or serum samples. Antigen detection by a direct immunofluorescence assay with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled monoclonal antibody, virus isolation, and serologic methods (in-house varicella-zoster virus [VZV] immunoglobulin G [IgG] and IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and the commercial Enzygnost assay) were compared. The direct immunofluorescence assay was found to be the most sensitive method, diagnosing 85 of 92 infections (92%), while the sensitivity of virus isolation was 65% (60 of 92 patients). Despite the use of two different serological methods, only 60 of 92 patients (65%) had significant VZV IgG titer rises, and only 26 of 92 patients (28%) had detectable VZV IgM. The lack of a VZV IgG antibody titer rise was found to correlate with low CD4 counts in peripheral blood and high VZV IgG titers in the acute-phase serum sample. The frequency of IgM-positive sera was lower than that expected from reports of studies with patients without AIDS. This may be related to early antiviral treatment or deficient antibody production due to the HIV-related immunosuppression. There was no significant difference in CD4 counts between VZV IgM-positive and -negative patients."

In this study, we investigated the in vivo effect of IL-15 treatment in 9 SIVmac251-infected cynomolgus macaques (low dose of IL-15, 10 microg/kg of body weight, n = 3; high dose of IL-15, 100 microg/kg, n = 3; control [saline], n = 3; dose administered twice weekly for 4 weeks). IL-15 treatment induced a nearly threefold increase in peripheral blood CD8+CD3- NK cells. Furthermore, CD8+ T-cell numbers increased more than twofold, mainly due to an increase in the CD45RA-CD62L- and CD45RA+CD62L- effector memory CD8+ T cells. Expression of Ki-67 in the CD8+ T cells indicated expansion of CD8+ T cells and not redistribution. IL-15 did not affect CD4+ T-cell, B-cell, and CD14+ macrophage numbers. No statistically significant differences in changes from baseline in the viral load were observed when control-, low-dose-, and high-dose-treated animals were compared. No clinical adverse effects were observed in any of the animals studied. The selective expansion of effector memory CD8+ T cells and NK cells by IL-15 further supports IL-15's possible therapeutic use in viral infections such as HIV infection."

Unique among chimpanzees naturally or experimentally infected with HIV, several animals of the Yerkes cohort have progressed to clinical AIDS with selection of isolates showing increased pathogenicity for chimpanzees. We compared progressors vs. nonprogressors among the HIV-infected chimpanzees that made up this cohort, eight of which have been infected with HIV-1 for over 14 years. The additional two progressors were infected de novo with chimpanzee-pathogenic HIV, rapidly leading to a progressor status. Nonprogressors were characterized by normal CD4(+) T cell counts and the absence of detectable viremia. In contrast, progressor chimpanzees had relatively high plasma viral loads associated with a dramatic loss of CD4(+) T cells. The analysis of immune responses showed a similar amplitude and breadth of ELISPOT T cell responses in both groups. HIV-specific proliferative responses were, however, absent in the progressor animals, which also exhibited increased levels of immune activation characterized by elevated levels of the circulating chemokines IP-10 and MCP-1. Of interest was the conservation of potent NK cell activity in all animals, potentially contributing to the extended symptom-free survival of progressor animals. Modest anti-HIV antibody titers were detectable in the nonprogressor group, but these antibodies exhibited good neutralizing activity. In progressors, however, two sets of data were noted: in animals that gradually selected for pathogenic isolates, or that were superinfected, very high neutralizing antibody titers were observed, although none to the pathogenic HIV. In contrast, two animals infected de novo with chimpanzee pathogenic HIV failed to mount an extensive humoral response and both failed to develop neutralizing antibodies to the virus. Taken together, pathogenic HIV infection in chimpanzees is associated with rapid loss of CD4(+) T cells and proliferative responses as well as higher levels of immune activation."

Despite many precedents demonstrating that CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes are key mediators of protective anti-viral immunity in non-human animal models, direct evidence that these effector cells control viral replication in HIV-1 infection has remained elusive. The first part of this paper describes a detailed immunological and genetic study founded on evolutionary considerations. Following infection with HIV-1, virus variants which escaped recognition by autologous cytotoxic T lymphocytes were shown to possess a selection advantage within the host environment. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes therefore exert anti-viral pressure in vivo. This observation provides compelling evidence that cytotoxic T lymphocytes comprise a significant element of anti-retroviral immunity. Subsequently, the quantification of peripheral cytotoxic T lymphocyte frequencies utilizing peptide-(human leucocyte antigen class I) tetrameric complexes is described. Five patients with qualitatively similar immunodominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses during symptomatic primary HIV-1 infection were studied longitudinally. Expansions of virus-specific CD8(+) lymphocytes comprising up to 2% of the total CD8(+) T cell population were observed in the acute phase of infection. Antigenic load was identified as an important determinant of circulating HIV-1-specific CD8(+) lymphocyte levels; however, significant numbers of such cells were also found to persist following prolonged therapeutic suppression of plasma viraemia. In addition, an analysis of antigenic sequence variation with time in this case series suggests that the early administration of combination anti-retroviral therapy may limit HIV-1 mutational escape from host cytolytic specificities. The implications of these preliminary data are discussed. The data presented suggest that vaccination protocols should aim to elicit vigorous cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to HIV-1. Attempts to stimulate polyvalent responses to mutationally intolerant epitopes are likely to be most effective. Optimal management of HIV-1 infection requires an understanding of dynamic host-virus interactions, and may involve strategies designed to enhance cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity following periods of anti-retroviral drug therapy."
282,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the frequency of opportunistic disorders (ODs) of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients has fallen dramatically. We have found, however, that despite the use of HAART, HIV-infected patients can still present with GI ODs. To evaluate the prevalence of GI ODs in HIV-infected patients on HAART who were undergoing endoscopic evaluation for GI-related symptoms. From January 1996 through February 2002, all HIV-infected patients undergoing GI endoscopy were prospectively identified; mucosal biopsies were obtained in a standardized fashion and histologic specimens were examined by a single GI pathologist. All the patients on HAART presenting with a GI OD are described. Results showed that 294 patients (88% men; mean age, 36.5 +/- 10 years; median CD4 lymphocyte count, 64 cells/microl; range, 1-884; median viral RNA level, 40,357 copies/ml; range, 0-7,721,715) underwent 401 upper and/or lower endoscopies during the study period. The use of HAART increased from 10% in early 1996 to 85% in 2002. Nevertheless we found that 27 patients (9%) presented with a GI OD despite HAART. Forty percent of the patients with a GI OD were noncompliant with HAART. We conclude that GI ODs can occur despite HAART and normal CD4 counts. The prevalence of GI ODs in HIV-infected patients taking HAART is 9%. The reasons for this are multifactorial and likely include noncompliance with medications, viral resistance to the drugs, and decreased drug bioavailability. Although the use of HAART has led to a decreased incidence of GI ODs in AIDS, the gastroenterologist evaluating these patients should not discard the possibility that the GI symptoms in HIV-infected patients taking HAART may be secondary to an OD, even when the CD4 count is normal and the viral load is low."

In addition to contributing to dramatic declines in the incidence of several opportunistic infections, HAART is affecting the incidences of several acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining malignancies. The incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) has dropped precipitously since the introduction of HAART in 1995. Systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) appears to be declining in incidence as well, but to a lesser degree than KS and PCNSL. On the contrary, the incidence of invasive cervical carcinoma has not significantly changed in the HAART era. The impact of HAART on the epidemiology of other HIV-associated malignancies, including Hodgkin's disease and anal carcinoma, remains unclear. Data regarding the impact of HAART on the natural history and treatment outcomes of HIV-associated malignancies are limited. The possibility of direct and indirect roles of HIV in HIV-related carcinogenesis suggests that antiretroviral therapy may be an important component of the treatment strategy for several HIV-related malignancies. Patients with HIV-NHL treated with HAART in addition to chemotherapy experience fewer intercurrent opportunistic infections. Furthermore, the simultaneous administration of HAART and chemotherapy does not appear to significantly increase toxicity. Whether the combination of HAART and standard therapy results in improved survival remains uncertain. This two-part article, which began in the April 2002 issue, analyzes the impact of HAART on the incidence, clinical course, and outcomes of each of the AIDS-related malignancies."

The present study was conducted to determine the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of abacavir in HIV-1-infected subjects following oral administration of daily doses that ranged from 600 to 1,800 mg, with and without zidovudine. Seventy-nine subjects received abacavir monotherapy for 4 weeks (200, 400, or 600 mg every 8 hours [TID] and 300 mg every 12 h [BID]) and thereafter received either zidovudine (200 mg TID or 300 mg BID) or matching placebo with abacavir for 8 additional weeks. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for abacavir after administration of the first dose and at week 4 and for abacavir, zidovudine, and its glucuronide metabolite at week 12. The concentrations of abacavir in cerebrospinal fluid were determined in a subset of subjects. Steady-state plasma abacavir concentrations were achieved by week 4 of monotherapy and persisted to week 12. At steady state, abacavir pharmacokinetic parameters (area under the plasma concentration-time curve for a dosing interval [AUC(tau)] and peak concentration [C(max)]) were generally proportional to dose over the range of a 600- to 1,200-mg total daily dose. Coadministration of zidovudine with abacavir produced a small and inconsistent effect on abacavir pharmacokinetic parameters across the different doses. At the clinical abacavir dose (300 mg BID) zidovudine coadministration had no effect on the abacavir AUC(tau), which is most closely associated with efficacy. Zidovudine pharmacokinetics appeared to be unaffected by abacavir. Statistically significant but weak relationships were found for the change in the log(10) HIV-1 RNA load from the baseline to week 4 versus total daily AUC(tau) and C(tau) (P < 0.05). The incidence of nausea was significantly associated with total daily AUC(tau) and C(max). In conclusion, abacavir has predictable pharmacokinetic characteristics following the administration of multiple doses."

The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in clinical practice has remarkably changed the natural history of HIV disease, leading to a notable extension of life expectancy, and prolonged lipid and glucose metabolism abnormalities are expected to lead to significant effects on the long-term prognosis and outcome of HIV-infected patients. Prediction modeling, surrogate markers and hard cardiovascular endpoints suggest an increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases in HIV-infected subjects receiving HAART, even though the absolute risk of cardiovascular complications remains still low, and must be balanced against the evident virological, immunological, and clinical benefits descending from combination antiretroviral therapy. Nevertheless, the assessment of cardiovascular risk should be performed on regular basis in HIV-positive individuals, especially after initiation or change of antiretroviral treatment. Appropriate lifestyle measures (including smoking cessation, dietary changes, and aerobic physical activity) are critical points, and switching HAART may be considered, although maintaining viremic control should be the main goal of therapy. Pharmacological treatment of dyslipidaemia (usually with statins and fibrates), and hyperglycaemia (with insulin-sensitizing agents and thiazolidinediones), becomes suitable when lifestyle modifications and switching therapy are ineffective or not applicable."

Although tuberculosis (TB)-associated IRIS is the most common form, its presentation as a primary feature of acute peritonitis is extraordinarily rare. We report a 43-year-old man diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and pulmonary TB coinfection. His symptoms, sputum quantity, and chest radiologic appearance improved markedly after 3 weeks of antituberculous therapy, and HAART was initiated on the fourth week. However, acute abdomen with peritoneal signs resulting from the established tuberculous peritonitis developed on the seventh day of HAART. His clinical symptoms resolved after maintenance of HAART and antituberculous regimens. Tuberculous peritonitis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in HIV-infected patients on antiviral therapy, especially in patients with known underlying TB. Early recognition of IRIS is important when managing HIV-infected patients with opportunistic infections."
890,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a potentially critical factor in the immune response against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because it is important for regulating proliferation and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production by T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, antigen presentation and accessory cell function by macrophages and dendritic cells, and cytolytic activities of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte cells and NK cells, which are all functions known to be dysfunctional in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HIV-infected patients have been previously shown to be deficient in the ability to produce IL-12 in response to the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus Cowan. In this study, impaired IL-12 production in cells from PBMC of HIV-infected patients compared with healthy donors was observed across a broad panel of stimuli derived from infectious pathogens with or without priming with cytokines such as IFN-gamma and IL-4, which amplify the IL-12 induction signal. Analysis of p40 and p35 mRNA accumulation showed that reductions in both subunits contribute to the lower IL-12 secretion of cells from HIV-infected individuals. PBMC from HIV-infected donors also failed to upregulate the IL-12 receptor beta2 chain (IL-12Rbeta2) in response to mitogenic stimuli. The expression of the IL-12Rbeta2 gene could, however, be restored by in vitro exposure to rIL-12. Thus, it is possible that a primary IL-12 defect may lead to secondary deficiencies in expression of the genes for IL-12Rbeta2 and IFN-gamma, thus amplifying immune deficiency during HIV infection."

On completion of an earlier study involving three vaccinations while taking combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), twenty-five subjects with plasma viral load (pVL) <50 copies/mL received a booster vaccination with either placebo (n = 7); fowl pox vaccine (rFPV) expressing HIV-1 Gag/Pol; [partial construct- PC (n = 8)] or rFPV coexpressing HIV-1 Gag/Pol and human interferon gamma[full construct - FC (n = 10)]. One week after the booster vaccination, participants stopped ART and were monitored for safety, pVL and immunological parameters for < or =20 weeks. The time weighted mean change (SD) from baseline plasma HIV RNA was 1.80 (0.72), 1.78 (0.91) and 0.96 (0.91) log(10) copies/mL for placebo, PC and FC recipients respectively (p = 0.06; mean differences between placebo and FC). Laboratory evaluations did not reveal differences in anti-HIV specific immune responses between study arms. No difference between treatment arms for host genetic factors known to affect pVL was demonstrated. In conclusion, vaccination with FC was associated with a trend toward lower rates of HIV replication following cessation of ART relative to placebo or PC. The promising antiretrovirological effect supports further study of FC in a larger trial with a broader population of patients with HIV disease."

Yet child, caregiver and socio-demographic factors associated with MHPs are not fully understood. We examined the prevalence of MHPs among older children and adolescents with perinatal HIV exposure, including both perinatally HIV-infected (PHIV +) and perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected (PHEU) youth. Our aims were to identify the impact of HIV infection by comparing PHIV + and PHEU youth and to delineate risk factors associated with MHPs, in order to inform development of appropriate prevention and intervention strategies. Youth and their caregivers were interviewed with the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 2nd edition (BASC-2) to estimate rates of at-risk and clinically significant MHPs, including caregiver-reported behavioral problems and youth-reported emotional problems. The prevalence of MHPs at the time of study entry was calculated for the group overall, as well as by HIV status and by demographic, child health, and caregiver characteristics. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with youth MHPs. Among 416 youth enrolled between March 2007 and July 2009 (295 PHIV +, 121 PHEU), the overall prevalence of MHPs at entry was 29% and greater than expected based on recent national surveys of the general population. MHPs were more likely among PHEU than among PHIV + children (38% versus 25%, p < 0.01). Factors associated with higher odds of MHPs at p < 0.10 included caregiver characteristics (psychiatric disorder, limit-setting problems, health-related functional limitations) and child characteristics (younger age and lower IQ). These findings suggest that PHEU children are at high risk for MHPs, yet current models of care for these youth may not support early diagnosis and treatment. Family-based prevention and intervention programs for HIV affected youth and their caregivers may minimize long-term consequences of MHPs."

In addition to legal concerns that might be common among persons with similar sociodemographic characteristics, HIV infection adds the potential of possible stigma and discrimination, as well as the prospect of illness and increased mortality. To determine women's perceptions of need for and access to legal services and whether such perceptions are affected by HIV infection, from November 1993 through September 1995 we interviewed 509 women with or at risk for HIV infection by virtue of injection drug use or high-risk sexual behaviors in New York and Baltimore, Maryland. A majority of women, regardless of HIV serostatus, reported current or future needs for legal assistance with government benefits. More than 25% reported needing current or future legal help with housing, debts, arrangements for care of children, a will, and advance directives. Substantial minorities of women reported other legal needs. HIV-positive women were significantly more likely to report anticipated future need for help with paternal custody or visitation, current need in making a will, and anticipated future assistance with advance directives. For most items, a majority of women thought they knew where to receive help. However, among women reporting a current need, only a minority actually were receiving legal assistance. This study suggests that the extent of legal needs among women with or at risk for HIV infection is substantial, and that few receive legal assistance. With few exceptions, at least for women early in the course of illness, HIV infection does not appear to alter the pattern or extent of legal needs. There are dramatic differences, regardless of HIV status, between expectation and reality in women's access to legal services."
386,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"In July 1982, the occurrence of three cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in men with haemophilia was an immediate signal to Oscar Ratnoff that AIDS was transmissible through blood products. Work that he led provided important and clear indication that the AIDS agent was transmissible through pooled plasma products and had rapidly infected many men who had haemophilia. Before the blood supply was protected, the risk for infection in haemophilia was related directly to the intensity of therapy with pooled anti-haemophilic factor concentrates. Studies performed among the small proportion of haemophiliacs who remained uninfected despite heavy exposure to these plasma products revealed that the rare protective genotype - homozygosity for the 32 base pair deletion in the CCR5 gene was heavily concentrated in this population. Among those who did not have this protective genotype, a state of diminished immune activation distinguished these high risk uninfected haemophiliacs from haemophiliacs who later acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and from healthy uninfected controls. Immune activation state may not only predict risk for HIV acquisition but also appears to be an important predictor and likely determinant of HIV disease progression. The potential drivers of immune activation in chronic HIV infection include HIV itself, other co-infecting pathogens, homeostatic responses to cytopenia as well as the recently recognised phenomenon of translocation of microbial products across a damaged gut mucosal surface. This latter process is particularly compelling as clinical studies have shown a good relationship between indices of microbial translocation and markers of both immune activation and T cell homeostasis in chronic HIV infection. More recently, we have also found evidence that these microbial products also may drive a heightened tendency to thrombus formation in HIV infection via induction of monocyte tissue factor expression. Thus systemic exposure to microbial elements that are translocated through a gut mucosa damaged in the first few weeks of HIV infection may contribute to the pathogenesis of both immune deficiency and the heightened risk for vascular events that have been noted in persons with HIV infection."

PCR was carried out in a multiplex nested configuration with pol and env region primer sets. HIV-1 DNA was detected in all of the HIV-1 seropositive patients. In contrast, HIV-1 DNA was not detected in any of the either seronegative or serologically indeterminate subjects. Only one of 37 seronegative regular sexual partners of HIV-1-infected patients who were followed longitudinally was found to seroconvert to HIV-1. However, HIV-1 DNA and antibody results were concordant in the four samples obtained from this subject prior to and after seroconversion. These results show an excellent concordance between HIV-1 DNA and antibody detection for diagnosis of HIV-1 infection and suggest that long-term HIV-1 infection in the absence of detectable antibody is likely to occur at a very low frequency."

Participants were interviewed and blood collected for evaluation of serological and molecular markers for HBV and HCV. The rate of exposure to HBV was 33.5% (95% CI 29.4-37.9). Nineteen patients (3.8%) were diagnosed as HBV carriers, of whom 68.4% were HBV DNA positive. The prevalence of anti-HCV was 9.7% (95% CI 7.3-12.7). Genotype 1a was identified in 72.7% of the PCR samples positive for HCV. Co-infection by all three viruses was 4.4% (95% CI 2.9-6.8). Being, male, aged ≥40 years, history of sexually transmitted disease (STD), and having homosexual practices were independently associated with the presence of markers of HBV exposure. A history of injectable drugs use and STDs showed association with HCV seropositivity. Approximately 50% of participants were not aware of their HBV and HCV serostatus. The results obtained may contribute to assess the burden of viral hepatitis in people living with HIV and to guiding preventive measures for more vulnerable groups. "

Incoming toll-free phone interviews were conducted from December 21, 2006, through March 14, 2007 among subjects recruited from a U.S. national network of AIDS counseling centers. Seven hundred HIV-infected women (43% African American, 28.5% Hispanic, 28.5% Caucasian; median age, 42.5 years) receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for 3 years or more replied to recruitment flyers. Overall, 55% of survey participants had never discussed gender-specific HIV treatment issues with their HIV care providers. Of the 45% who did discuss these issues, almost all (96%) were satisfied. On average, one-third of the women had seen three or more providers since beginning HIV treatment; 43% indicated they had switched providers because of communication issues. Among women who had been or were pregnant at the time of the survey (n=159), more than half (57%) had not had pre-pregnancy discussions with their HIV provider about the most appropriate HIV regimens for women attempting to become pregnant. Significant communication gaps exist between HIV-infected women and their providers when discussing gender-specific treatment issues. These data highlight a need for U.S. health care providers to incorporate discussion of gender-specific issues, including preconception and reproductive counseling, into management strategies for HIV-infected women."
12603,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"This article reports on qualitative research investigating HIV positive individuals' reproductive intentions and their influencing factors in Cape Town, South Africa. In-depth interviews were held with 61 HIV positive women and men; at the time of interview, half had been receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) for over 6 months and half were not receiving ART. Being HIV positive modified but did not remove reproductive desires, and diversity existed in reproductive intentions. Some HIV positive individuals wished to avoid pregnancy. Fears of partner and infant infection and having a previously infected baby were important factors deterring some individuals from considering having children. There was also strongly perceived community disapproval associated with HIV and reproduction. Strong desires to experience parenthood, mediated by prevailing social and cultural norms that encouraged childbearing in society more broadly, were reported by others. Motherhood was an important component of married women's identity and important for women's social status. Family, husbands' and societal expectations for childbearing were important influences on women's reproductive intentions, for some counterbalancing HIV as a factor discouraging reproduction. There was evidence that prevention of perinatal transmission programs in combination with ART may alter women and men's attitudes in favour of childbearing. Most HIV positive women had not discussed their reproductive desires and intentions with health care providers in HIV care or general health services because of anticipated negative reactions. The few who had done so perceived the counselling environment to be mostly unsupportive of open discussion on these issues. The findings highlight the need for explicit policies recognizing reproductive rights and choice. They support the need for health counselling and service interventions that advance safer and healthier reproductive options for HIV positive individuals in this region of the world which is experiencing a generalised and advanced HIV/AIDS pandemic."

We assessed disclosure patterns and correlates of non-disclosure among adult TB-HIV patients initiating ART enrolled in the START Study, a mixed-methods cluster-randomized trial conducted in Lesotho, which evaluated a combination intervention package (CIP) versus standard of care. Interviewer-administered questionnaire data were analyzed to describe patterns of disclosure. Patient-related factors were assessed for association with non-disclosure to anyone other than a health-care provider and primary partners using generalized linear mixed models. Among 371 participants, 95% had disclosed their HIV diagnosis to someone other than a health-care provider, most commonly a spouse/primary partner (76%). Age, TB knowledge, not planning to disclose TB status, greater perceived TB stigma, and CIP were associated with non-disclosure in unadjusted models (p < .1). In adjusted models, all point estimates were similar and greater TB knowledge (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-0.90) and CIP (aOR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.79) remained statistically significant. Among 220 participants with a primary partner, 76% had disclosed to that partner. Significant correlates of partner non-disclosure (p < .1) in unadjusted analyses included being female, married/cohabitating, electricity at home, not knowing if partner was HIV-positive, and TB knowledge. Adjusted point estimates were largely similar, and being married/cohabitating (aOR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.12), having electricity at home (aOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17-0.85) and greater TB knowledge (aOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.98) remained significant. In conclusion, although nearly all participants reported disclosing their HIV status to someone other than a health-care provider at ART initiation, nearly a quarter of participants with a primary partner had not disclosed to their partner. Additional efforts to support HIV disclosure (e.g., counseling) may be needed for TB-HIV patients, particularly for women and those unaware of their partners' status."

Genes were typified through the polymerase chain reaction. In spite of the presence of immunogenetic factors, associated with individual predisposition to a rapid evolution of the disease, changes in sexual behavior, including safe sex practices and antiretroviral therapy, may be related to greater survival. This suggests that counseling, detection of risk attitudes and health education, focusing on positive health behavior, are tools nursing must use with HIV-positive patients, with a view to better quality of life and greater survival among these individuals, even among those with genetic predisposition to rapid disease progression."

This meta-analytic review examined whether behavioral interventions addressing HAART adherence are successful in increasing the likelihood of a patient attaining 95% adherence or an undetectable HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL). We searched electronic databases from January 1996 to September 2005, consulted with experts in the field, and hand searched reference sections from relevant articles. Nineteen studies (with a total of 1839 participants) met the selection criteria of describing a randomized controlled trial among adults evaluating a behavioral intervention with HAART adherence or VL as an outcome. Random-effects models indicated that across studies, participants in the intervention arm were more likely than those in the control arm to achieve 95% adherence (odds ratio [OR] = 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16 to 1.94); the effect was nearly significant for undetectable VL (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.59). The intervention effect for 95% adherence was significantly stronger in studies that used recall periods of 2 weeks or 1 month (vs. </=7 days). No other stratification variables (ie, study, sample, measurement, methodologic quality, intervention characteristics) moderated the intervention effect, but some potentially important factors were observed. In sum, various HAART adherence intervention strategies were shown to be successful, but more research is needed to identify the most efficacious intervention components and the best methods for implementing them in real-world settings with limited resources."

We performed a retrospective multi-centre study in the Canary Islands using a sample of 569 patients recruited at outpatient visits. The study examined demographic and clinical variables, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and health care resources. Clinical data was obtained from medical records and patient interviews. Several empirical models for identifying the relationship between health care costs and independent variables were developed. The greatest expense came from pharmaceutical expenditure (82.1% of direct costs), while hospital costs only represented 4.6% of total expenditure. The data showed a statistically significant association between health care costs and the CD4 count of the previous year. HRQOL was also a significant variable. Therefore, CD4 cell count can be used to predict health care costs in patients. Policymakers could use this information to help guide their decisions in allocating limited health care resources to HIV treatments."

A total of 128 paired cervicovaginal and blood samples was obtained from 37 women during a median follow-up period of 21 months. A sensitive, competitive, polymerase chain reaction and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were used for the simultaneous quantitation of HIV-1 proviral DNA and RNA in cervicovaginal cells and cell-free RNA in cervicovaginal secretions, as well as HIV-1 RNA in peripheral blood. The cumulative probability of detecting proviral DNA in genital secretions was significantly higher over time in women with detectable viremia than in women in whom HIV-1 RNA was persistently undetectable in plasma (< 50 copies/ml) (P = 0.028 by log-rank test). The presence and amount of proviral DNA, cell-associated RNA and cell-free RNA in the cervicovaginal secretions were positively correlated with the presence of detectable viremia or the number of HIV-1 RNA copies in plasma (Spearman rank correlation, 0.290, 0.279, and 0.305, respectively; all P < 0.01), but no correlation was found with the CD4+ cell count. In addition, vaginal infections were positively correlated with the detection of proviral DNA in cervicovaginal secretions (odds ratio, 2.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-5.70). However, the positive correlation between the presence and amount of HIV in cervicovaginal secretions and the viral load in plasma provides no assurance that HIV shedding does not occur in the genital tract of women with undetectable HIV-RNA in plasma."

We aimed to examine the HIV prevalence, age and gender distribution, and the effectiveness of HAART on CD4 positive cell count, viral load (VL), and mortality in the Greenland HIV-infected population. In this population-based cohort study we collected demographic, clinical and biochemical data on all HIV-infected patients followed in health clinics since 1995. For each case, we identified 100 age- and gender-matched population controls. The HIV cohort included 103 patients of whom 91% were Inuit; 81% were infected heterosexually. Only 40% of the patients had a VL <400 copies/ml at 48 weeks after starting HAART, and patients on HAART had a substantial excess relative mortality compared with the general population (mortality rate ratio [MRR]: 10.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.9-16.4). After the introduction of HAART, the mortality decreased (MRR: 2.5; 95% CI 0.9-6.8), but remained high with a mortality rate of 62 per 1000 person-years (py) (95% CI 29-129).

HDL-c values were categorized as either low (<39 mg/dL in males or <49 mg/dL in females) or normal. Cancer diagnoses were classified as AIDS-defining malignancies (ADMs) or non-AIDS-defining malignancies (NADMs). Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used.Among 4897 patients (13,440 person-years of follow-up [PYFU]), 104 diagnoses of cancer were observed (56 ADMs, 48 NADMs) for an overall incidence rate of 7.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.3-9.2) per 1000 PYFU.Low HDL-c values at enrollment were associated with higher risk both of cancer (crude hazard ratio [HR] 1.72, 95% CI 1.16-2.56, P = 0.007) and of NADM (crude HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.35-4.76, P = 0.003). Multivariate analysis showed that the risk of cancer diagnosis was higher in patients with low HDL-c values (adjusted HR [AHR] 1.87, 95% CI 1.18-2.95, P = 0.007) in older patients, those patients more recently enrolled, and in those with low current cluster of differentiation 4+ levels, and/or high current HIV-ribonucleic acid.The multivariate model confirmed an association between HDL-c (AHR 2.61, 95% CI 1.40-4.89, P = 0.003) and risk of NADM.Low HDL-c is an independent predictor of cancer in HIV-1-infected subjects.

Bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and venipuncture were performed for each patient at a specific time after administration of the last dose of dapsone. Dapsone concentrations in plasma and BAL were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The apparent volume of ELF recovered by BAL was determined by using urea as an endogenous marker. The mean concentrations of dapsone in ELF at 2 h (five patients), 4 h (three patients), 12 h (two patients), 24 h (three patients), and 48 h (three patients) were 0.95, 0.70, 1.55, 0.23, and 0.45 mg/liter, respectively, while concentrations in plasma were 1.23, 0.79, 1.31, 0.83, and 0.18 mg/liter, respectively. Dapsone concentrations in ELF were 76, 79, 115, 65, and 291% of those observed in plasma at the same times, respectively. These data show that dapsone is well distributed into ELF and that a twice-weekly 100-mg prophylactic regimen results in sustained concentrations in this compartment."
3353,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) causes chronic ongoing inflammation in HIV-1 seropositive individuals as shown by high plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines and production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). One source of ROIs is provided from the very early stages of HIV infection by activated polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Tat, the viral protein, is also specifically responsible for an endogenous cellular increase of ROI. In this review we also evaluate the effects of this oxidative stress on various biological parameters such as immune response and survival of T lymphocytes, virus transcription and replication. It was clearly demonstrated in ex vivo experiments that the oxidative stress due to infection itself participates in CD4+ T lymphocyte depletion by increasing their rate of apoptosis and particularly of Fas-induced apoptosis. This oxidative stress also facilitates NF-kappa B-dependent activation of HIV transcription. In vitro studies suggest that the early steps of HIV activation from its quiescent state might be subsequently facilitated by this oxidative environment. Whereas already active replication is not influenced. The data presented here lead to a better understanding of the consequences of oxidative stress on the pathophysiology of HIV infection and also enable us to evaluate the potential use of antioxidant molecules as therapeutic agents against AIDS."

This retrospective study reports on the incidence of maternal and neonatal CMV (presence of anti-CMV IgG and IgM, CMV DNA PCR and/or CMV virus isolation) in high-risk pregnancies due to maternal HIV infection, MTCT of HIV and/or CMV. One hundred and eleven maternal samples and 75 matched neonatal samples were available for HIV and subsequent CMV testing. In this cohort of HIV-positive pregnant women, 96 (86.5 %) serum samples were anti-CMV IgG positive. In nine (9.4 %) of these, anti-CMV IgM was detected, and in none of them a maternal primary CMV infection was suspected. Fifty-seven (51.8 %) maternal serum samples were tested retrospectively by CMV DNA PCR; one sample was positive (0.9 %). All matched neonates were tested for HIV by PCR in the first month of life; HIV transmission was detected in one case. In 74 (67.2 %) of neonates, CMV testing was performed. Sixty-six of these serum samples were tested retrospectively by CMV DNA PCR. Two newborns (2.7 %) showed laboratory markers for CMV infection (one by detection of CMV DNA in plasma, and one by isolation of CMV from a urine sample). In the follow-up, neither of these two showed clinical signs for active CMV disease. We discussed these findings in the light of the national official guidelines. All CMV transmissions occurred due to maternal reinfection or endogenous reactivation. This suggests the success of highly active antiretroviral therapy in preventing MTCT of HIV and CMV disease and highlights the importance of adequate care and follow-up."

Its management must include both initial and maintenance treatment. Although most authorities favor an initial period of therapy with amphotericin B for acute cryptococcosis, the triazoles play a role in both the management of acute disease and subsequent maintenance therapy. AIDS surveillance data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention document the occurrence of cryptococcosis in more than 17,000 (6.2%) of adults with AIDS in the United States, although this figure is known to be an underestimate. The risk of cryptococcosis among HIV-infected persons is highest at CD4+ lymphocyte counts of < 100/microL. Although cryptococcosis is especially frequent among AIDS patients who are black, male, or injection drug users, the explanations for these patterns remain unclear. Whether geographic differences in rates of cryptococcosis result from variations in the environmental distribution of Cryptococcus neoformans as well as in the distribution of HIV infection is also unclear. Although exposure to pigeon feces is the best known of the putative exposure-related risk factors, proof is lacking that avian excreta are the primary environmental source of the organism in most cases of cryptococcosis. Prophylaxis with triazoles can prevent cryptococcosis and may be considered for adults and adolescents with CD4+ counts of < 50/microL. However, it is uncertain whether prophylaxis will affect survival, be cost-effective, or have an adverse impact on the susceptibility of a variety of fungi to antifungal drugs. Vaccines and monoclonal antibodies designed to prevent or modify cryptococcosis in HIV-infected persons are in the experimental stage."

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 6 weeks in individuals with recent HCV infection. In this open-label study conducted in Australia and New Zealand, adults with recent HCV (duration of infection <12 months) received sofosbuvir 400 mg daily and weight-based ribavirin (<75 kg, 1,000 mg/day; ≥75 kg, 1,200 mg/day) for 6 weeks.

Sustained virological response (SVR) rates varied signixFB01;cantly across patient subgroups and the concept of 'special populations' emerged. Now, in the era of direct acting antivirals, with a better safety profile and higher efficacy rates, those patients with comorbidities or conditions that limited IFN-based antiviral treatment but with unmet medical needs have been considered for therapy again. With the currently approved all-oral antivirals, patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus and HCV have SVR rates similar to patients with HCV monoinfection. However, drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with antiretroviral drugs are still challenging. In the setting of liver transplantation, with an accelerated course of hepatitis C, previous IFN-RBV treatments were poorly tolerated and attained low SVR rates. Today, all-oral therapies have proven to be efficacious and safe in this population. Nevertheless, questions such as the optimal treatment duration or the need for RBV still remain opened. In this population as well, DDIs are an issue, as some regimens require adjustments and monitoring of immunosuppressive drugs during therapy. Finally, preliminary data show promising results in terms of efficacy and safety in patients with end-stage renal disease. However, there is clear need for more clinical studies since treatment options are still very limited. "

Earlier studies have indicated that such foreign constituents can modulate the virus life cycle, although the potential roles that these proteins might play in the viral pathology in vivo remain unclear. In an attempt to shed light on this issue, we first exposed explants of human lymphoid tissue to isogenic viruses except for the presence or absence of host-derived ICAM-1. Incorporation of ICAM-1 alone increased HIV-1 infectivity for human tonsillar tissue cultured ex vivo. This observation was made for viruses bearing distinct coreceptor utilization profiles. Conversion of LFA-1 to a high-affinity-high-avidity state for ICAM-1 further augmented the susceptibility of human tonsillar histocultures to infection by ICAM-1-bearing virions. A more massive depletion of CD4(+) T lymphocytes was seen with X4 ICAM-1/POS viruses than with isogenic ICAM-1/NEG virions. Exposure of X4 and R5 primary isolates of HIV-1 to a blocking anti-ICAM-1 antibody resulted in a decrease of virus infection. Finally, X4 and R5 virions derived from a natural human lymphoid tissue microenvironment incorporated high levels of ICAM-1. Altogether, these results indicate that the incorporation of host ICAM-1 can significantly modulate the biology of HIV-1 in a cellular milieu recognized as the major site of replication in vivo and suggest that host proteins found in HIV-1 particles may participate in the pathogenesis of this disease."

Hepatotoxicity can be a result of several factors, including a direct effect of HAART, substance abuse, and coinfection with either hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus. Imaging studies may be helpful in determining the etiology; however, a liver biopsy is often necessary to be able to more accurately determine the relative contributions of different processes.

CD4 counts vary in uninfected individuals and across populations due to a variety of demographic, environmental, immunological and genetic factors that probably persist throughout the course of HIV infection. This study sought to determine reference levels and identify factors that influence lymphocyte counts in 681 HIV-uninfected adults in Senegal, where residents are exposed to a variety of infectious diseases and other conditions that may affect CD4 counts. Lymphocyte counts were assessed in commercial sex workers, symptomatic men and women presenting to the University of Dakar infectious disease clinic for out-patient care and women seeking family planning services. CD4 and CD3 lymphocyte counts differed between the four study groups (P < 0.01). Men had the lowest mean CD4 count (711.6 cells/microl), while commercial sex workers had the highest levels (966.0 cells/microl). After adjustment for age and other behavioural and clinical factors, the difference in CD4 counts between the three groups of women did not remain. However, both gender and smoking were associated independently with CD4 counts, as men maintained lower mean CD4 counts (beta = -156.4 cells/microl, P < 0.01) and smokers had higher mean CD4 counts (beta = 124.0 cells/microl, P < 0.01) than non-smokers in multivariable analyses.

However, clinical aggravations after the initiation of HAART have been thought to be due to the restored ability to mount an inflammatory response, or the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The degree of IRIS observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients following initiation of HAART is variable. This prospective study was aimed at determining the proportion of IRIS and the pattern of opportunistic infections among 186 HIV/AIDS patients receiving HAART between December 2006 and July 2007 at Zewditu Memorial Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The proportion of IRIS was 17.2% (32/186). The mean number of days of IRIS occurrence for each disease ranged from 26 to 122 days with a mean of 80. Opportunistic diseases associated with IRIS were tuberculosis (68.8%, 22/32), herpes zoster rash (12.5%, 4/32), cryptococcosis (9.4%, 3/32), toxoplasmosis (6.3%, 2/32) and bacterial pneumonia (3.1%, 1/32). Compared to baseline readings there were significant increases in CD4 count, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels while hemoglobin values decreased during the development of IRIS. In summary, the proportion of IRIS and the pattern of opportunistic infections in HAART-treated patients in Ethiopia mirrored those reported in other countries. Further prospective surveys on epidemiological, immunological, microbial and clinical studies are imperative to assess the proportion and pattern of IRIS and effect of HAART in Ethiopia."

The majority of HCV-positive index subjects were non-Hispanic white, with a median age of 49 years (range, 26-79 years) and median of 15 years (range, 2-52 years) of sexual activity with their partners. Overall, HCV prevalence among partners was 4% (n=20), and nine couples had concordant genotype/serotype. Viral isolates in three couples (0.6%) were highly related, consistent with transmission of virus within the couple. Based on 8,377 person-years of follow-up, the maximum incidence rate of HCV transmission by sex was 0.07% per year (95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.13) or approximately one per 190,000 sexual contacts.

Genetic characterization of viral subtypes and its relationship with distinct at-risk populations was carried out. A total of 1,303 immigrants were identified. They originated in Latin America (46.9%), Sub-Saharan Africa (23.7%), Eastern Europe (9.4%), and the Maghreb (9.2%). Seroprevalence rates were as follows: HIV-1 4.2%, HBV 4.1%, HCV 2.9%, and HTLV-1 0.8%. All patients with HIV-1 non-B subtypes, HBV genotypes E and A3, and HCV genotype 4 were sub-Saharan Africans, and had been infected mainly through heterosexual contacts. In contrast, Latin American homo/bisexual men carried HIV-1 subtype B most likely acquired after their arrival to Spain. In conclusion, while Sub-Saharan Africans carry wide diverse genetic variants of blood-borne viruses, the absence of high-risk practices in most cases could limit the spread of these variants. In contrast, Latin Americans with high-risk sexual practices may be a particularly vulnerable collective to acquire blood-borne viruses in the receptor country."

We have examined the possibility that the severe outcome of infection in patients with fulminant disease may be a result of additional genomic variation. We sequenced the entire HBV genome from three patients of Greek and one patient of Chinese origin with fulminant hepatitis, and from two patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive chronic infection from the same regions, using direct sequencing of amplified viral DNA. Three of the fulminant cases were infected with the precore stop-codon variant HBeAg negative) and the fourth with the wild-type (HBeAg) positive virus. We compared sequences from our four fulminant isolates, and an additional fulminant isolate reported by others, with HBeAg positive carriers from the same regions and 12 published HBV genomes. There was a higher number of nucleotide and amino-acid substitutions throughout the HBV genome in the precore variant fulminant sequences than in the wild type. A cluster of mutations previously identified in the X region (126-132) in sequences reported in Japanese patients and encompassing the Enhancer II-Core Promoter region (1751-1768), were not found in our patients. We conclude that although there are no changes common to all sequences of HBV isolates from fulminant cases, some of these changes are in recognized cis-acting regulatory elements, whilst others are in the immediate vicinity of such elements. The effect of these mutations on viral genome transcription must now be determined."

Extreme views on testing are prevalent, both from the Centers for Disease Control, which does not recommend routine testing, to physicians advocating screening. The prevalence of HIV virus in our population undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis was investigated. Eighty-two patients ranging in age from 7-72 years were screened. There were seven positive results by both ELISA and Western Blot assays. Four had no risk factors, except for transfusion therapy before HIV screening. Three were known homosexuals. Only two of the HIV positive patients and three of the rest of the dialysis population had serologic markers for Hepatitis B infection. This 9% prevalence was much higher than expected. Although the data suggest that the risk to the health care worker is low, current recommendations to treat all patients as if they may be HIV positive protect the hospital or dialysis facility but may be unworkable. The health care workers attention is not focused because they do not differentiate between low and high risk patient groups. Furthermore, the number of patients who acquired the virus prior to routine screening is unknown. Because most dialysis patients were alive and transfused during this time period they may have inadvertently acquired the virus. If others share these findings, the implications for control of this disease are frightening, as the risk of transmission to patients' sexual partners is not inconsequential. I believe these findings support routine screening for HIV antibody."

Huang, L. Zhang, and D. D. Ho, J. Virol. 69:93-100, 1995). Here we extend our study to examine these nef alleles in a functional context. Using a new technique, termed site-directed gene replacement, we have precisely replaced the nef of an infectious molecular clone, HIV-1HXB2, with nef alleles derived from 10 long-term survivors as well as from a patient with AIDS. The replication properties of these chimeric viruses demonstrated that the nef alleles derived from long-term survivors neither significantly increased nor decreased viral replication, compared with the nef allele of Nef+ HIV-1HXB2 and that derived from a patient with AIDS. However, Nef+ viruses always replicated faster than virus lacking nef. Moreover, single-cell infection analysis by the MAGI assay showed that these chimeric viruses, as well as Nef+ HIV-1HXB2, were more infectious than Nef- HIV-1HXB2 was. Therefore, we conclude that the genotypic and phenotypic features of nef are not likely to account for the nonprogression of HIV-1 infection in the 10 cases studied, unless the function of the nef gene in vivo is not accurately reflected by the in vitro assays we used."
945,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Modifications of the glutathione (GSH) intracellular level have been implicated in the regulation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transcription and expression. In regard to this hypothesis, we have investigated the effects of valproic acid (VPA) on HIV replication. Indeed, it has been recently reported that VPA inhibits the human red blood cell glutathione reductase. In the supernatant of a CEM-SS T-lymphocytic cell line infected with the LAI strain of HIV-1, we observed an increase, in a dose-dependent fashion, of the reverse transcriptase activity after treatment of cells with VPA. VPA also induced HIV expression in the chronically infected monocytic U1 cell line which constitutively expresses low levels of virus, enhanced the HIV-long terminal repeat (LTR)-directed expression of beta-galactosidase in transiently transfected Jurkat T-cells, and potentiated the PMA effect on the LTR transactivation. GSH assays showed that VPA treatment led to a decrease in the intracellular level of this thiol compound in U937 (U1 parent-cell line) and in Jurkat T-cells. Work to understand the molecular mechanism of VPA-induced HIV transcription and expression are now in progress. VPA seems to be an adequate molecule to study the implications of a GSH decrease in the stimulation of HIV replication. However, a modification of the intracellular balance between reduced and oxidized glutathione, rather than a simple reduction of the intracellular glutathione level, could be of importance in the regulation of HIV replication and we are now testing this hypothesis. Finally, these findings already suggest that VPA, which is an anticonvulsive drug frequently prescribed for the management of various seizure disorders, should not be recommended for treatment of epilepsy or other related illnesses in HIV-positive individuals."

Men having sex with men had a lower tendency of missing dose than heterosexuals (13.6% versus 42%, P=0.019). There was no association between missing doses and clinical staging or the regimens. The study revealed that missing doses may occur despite report of almost complete adherence, which, in the long run, could be a cause for concern."

The arthritis progressed despite the use of several disease-modifying medications, including corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, and minocycline. Because of uncontrolled, progressive, and disabling arthritis and resulting profound disability, he was treated with etanercept. Within 3 weeks, his psoriasis had improved dramatically and his joint inflammation had stabilized. For the next 4 months, immunologic and viral parameters remained stable, but his clinical course was complicated by frequent polymicrobial infections. Etanercept was thus discontinued despite continued improvements in his psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and functional status. While both cutaneous and joint manifestations of psoriasis improved dramatically, the experience with this patient dictates that caution and careful follow-up must be exercised when prescribing etanercept in the setting of HIV infection."

Here we describe the 5-yr posttransplantation sequence of a hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive recipient who received an HBsAg-positive living donor liver graft. A 43-yr-old HBV-positive patient with hepatorenal syndrome received a living donor liver graft in October 2000 from a 27-yr-old HBsAg-positive carrier with no clinical evidence of HBV infection other than the serologic markers. The recipient recovered slowly after liver transplantation (LT). Recipient serum HBsAg was continuously positive despite anti-HBV therapy with high-dose hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and lamivudine. The patient was also treated with famciclovir and interferon; to date, a final regimen of lamivudine and adefovir has kept liver function stable for 20 months. The recipient has lived for 64 months after transplantation. The donor has not revealed any clinical evidence of active hepatitis during follow-up. In conclusion, our result implicates that a recipient of liver graft from an HBsAg-positive carrier may survive for a long period following antiviral therapy with lamivudine and adefovir. Considering this living donor case and previously reported cases, the use of an HBsAg-positive cadaveric liver graft may deserve attention when no other donor is available."

Despite treatment with thiabendazole, the patient died. Autopsy findings revealed severe ileocolitis due to Strongyloides larvae, right subdiaphragmatic pyogenic abscess, and severe pleuritis of the right lower lobe of the lung. This case illustrates that despite effective antihelmintic therapy, mortality is still high in patients with the hyperinfective state of S. stercoralis.

5655,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"More than 75 million people worldwide have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and there are now approximately 37 million individuals living with the infection. Untreated HIV replication causes progressive CD4(+) T cell loss and a wide range of immunological abnormalities, leading to an increased risk of infectious and oncological complications. HIV infection also contributes to cardiovascular disease, bone disease, renal and hepatic dysfunction and several other common morbidities. Antiretroviral drugs are highly effective at inhibiting HIV replication, and for individuals who can access and adhere to these drugs, combination antiretroviral therapy leads to durable (and probably lifelong) suppression of viral replication. Viral suppression enables immune recovery and the near elimination of the risk for developing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Despite effective treatment, HIV-infected individuals have a higher than expected risk of heart, bone, liver, kidney and neurological disease. When used optimally by an infected (or by an uninfected) person, antiretroviral drugs can virtually eliminate the risk of HIV transmission. Despite major advances in prevention sciences, HIV transmission remains common in many vulnerable populations, including men who have sex with men, injection drug users and sex workers. Owing to a lack of widespread HIV testing and the costs and toxicities associated with antiretroviral drugs, the majority of the infected population is not on effective antiretroviral therapy. To reverse the pandemic, improved prevention, treatment and implementation approaches are necessary."
15102,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (FCH) is a rare and extremely severe form of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. This condition was originally described in HBV-infected recipients after a liver transplantation. Recently, FCH has been reported not only in liver transplant recipients, but also in other immunosuppressed patients. It is characterized clinically by cholestatic hepatic dysfunction, and pathologically by severe periportal fibrosis, cholestasis, widespread balloon degeneration of hepatocytes, and only a mild infiltration of inflammatory cells. Without treatment, FCH is universally fatal within a few months of diagnosis. There have been only two isolated case reports of FCH with long-term patient survival, and one case report with treatment failure after lamivudine therapy. Because of the rarity of this clinical entity, the therapeutic efficacy of lamivudine in patients with FCH cannot be evaluated systematically. Here, we present four patients with HBV-related FCH treated with lamivudine. One received antineoplastic therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and the other three were renal graft recipients. Two patients who developed FCH after a renal transplantation survived with an improvement in liver function and were followed up for 20 and 30 months, respectively, and were found to be in good health. However, the other two patients died of sepsis, possibly as a consequence of the immunosuppression with hepatic failure despite lamivudine treatment. Our experience suggests that lamivudine can alter the grave natural history of FCH."

Many studies have suggested that T-cell production of and/or responsiveness to the T cell growth factor interleukin-2 (IL-2) declines over the course of HIV-1 infection. Using a highly quantitative 6-day limiting dilution assay (LDA), we investigated whether the number and the proliferative capacity of circulating IL-2 responsive cells in patients with AIDS differ from those in patients in earlier stages of HIV-1 infection (asymptomatic or AIDS-related complex) and healthy seronegative individuals. The frequency of IL-2 responsive cells declined progressively in asymptomatic seropositive subjects, those with ARC, and those with AIDS. In contrast, the proliferative capacity of individual IL-2 responsive cells, as reflected by the magnitude of thymidine uptake per precursor, was reduced only in patients with frank AIDS and was normal in asymptomatic subjects and in those with ARC. These results suggest that the development of AIDS in the setting of HIV-1 infection may reflect a combination of qualitative as well as quantitative changes in lymphocyte function. They also suggest that analysis of lymphocyte responsiveness to IL-2 may provide a useful approach to prediction of the development of AIDS in individuals infected with HIV-1."

The exon1 coding polymorphisms of the MBL2 gene have been implicated in the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, but the results were controversial. In the present study, a case-control study in a Chinese population was conducted to replicate the association, and then a meta-analysis combing our new data and published data was performed to clarify these findings. In total, 15 studies consisting 2219 HIV-1 patients and 2744 controls were included. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were assessed in the main analyses. By dividing the controls into two groups, healthy controls and HIV-1 exposed but seronegative (HESN) controls, we explored different genetic models and allelic model to detect the association. By using the healthy controls, we found that the MBL2 exon 1 polymorphisms were associated with hosts' susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in dominant model (p=0.01, 95% CI 1.05-1.43), recessive model (p<0.0001, 95% CI 1.35-2.28), allelic model (p<0.0001, 95% CI 1.12-1.37) and O/O vs. A/A model (p<0.00001, 95% CI 1.40-2.38). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant elevated risks were found in Caucasians (recessive model: p<0.0001, 95% CI 1.36-2.51), but not in Asians (recessive model: p=0.10, 95% CI 0.91-2.77). Collectively, our findings from our case-control replication study and meta-analysis suggested that the MBL2 gene exon 1 coding variants were associated with hosts' susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, especially in Caucasians, but not in Asians.

Long-term trends in pediatric (ages, 0-13 years), perinatal acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases were analyzed by log-linear Poisson regression for the period 1992-2004. Estimates for the number of perinatal HIV infections that occurred during the more recent period of 2001-2004 were developed by extrapolation from the 33 states with ongoing HIV (non-AIDS) reporting to the entire United States with the use of a probabilistic model. The number of pediatric perinatal AIDS cases that were identified decreased from 858 in 1992 to only 41 in 2004. These declines were consistent across demographic and regional subgroups. Data on the number of perinatal HIV infections suggests ongoing declines throughout the early years of the 21st century from 277 (95% CI, 224-346) in 2001 to 138 (95% CI, 96-186) in 2004. The incidence and morbidity associated with perinatal HIV infection continue to decline. To ensure that existing prevention efforts continue to achieve control of these infections, consistent methods of public health surveillance must be instituted throughout the entire United States."

In unadjusted analyses, detectable HIV viral load (vs undetectable, <400 copies/mL) was associated with a 40% greater odds (OR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.9, P = 0.016) of FIB-4 > 1.45 in the HIV/HCV-coinfected group and 70% greater odds of FIB-4 > 1.45 (OR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0-2.8; P = 0.046) in the HIV-mono-infected group.

Among the HIV/HCV-coinfected group, the elevating effect of HIV RNA on FIB-4 was strongest at low CD4 counts (P = 0.0037). Among the HIV-mono-infected group, the association between HIV RNA and FIB-4 was independent of CD4 cell counts. HIV RNA was associated with alterations in both liver enzymes and platelet counts. HIV antiretroviral therapy was not associated with any measure of liver injury examined. This study suggests that HIV may have direct, injurious effects on the liver and that HIV viral load should be considered when these indirect markers are used to assess liver function."

Adherence was self-reported by four-day recall, two- and seven-day treatment interruptions, and the CASE Index, which is a composite score accounting for difficulty taking medications on time, the average number of days per week a dose is missed, and the most recent missed dose. A total of 84% and 87% of participants reported good adherence by the four-day recall and CASE Index, respectively; 13% of participants reported two-day treatment interruptions; and 11% were depressed. Depression was significantly associated with two-day treatment interruptions but not with other measures of non-adherence. Self-reported adherence to antiretroviral therapy in rural Rwanda is high. Adherence assessments that do not consider treatment interruptions may miss important patterns of non-adherence, which may be especially prevalent among depressed individuals.

Clinical and biological data were collected every 3 months. Predictors for survival were identified using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models. A 2-slope-mixed linear model was used to estimate MELD score changes as a function of survival.Sixty seven patients were included in 32 centers between 2009 and 2012 (72% male; median age: 48 years [interquartile ratio (IQR):45-52], median follow-up: 22.4 months [range: 0.5-65.3]). Overall survival rates were 86%, 78%, and 59% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Under multivariate analysis, the MELD score at initial decompensation was predictive of survival, adjusted for age, type of decompensation, baseline CD4 counts, and further decompensation during follow-up as a time-dependent variable. The adjusted hazard ratio of death was 1.32 for a score 3 points higher (95% CI: [1.06-1.63], P = 0.012).

Children received antiretroviral therapy (ART), iron and, folate supplements as per standard of care. Among 80 enrolled HIV-infected children (mean age 6.8 years), the prevalence of anemia was 52.5%. Etiology of anemia was found to be iron deficiency alone in 38.1%, anemia of inflammation alone in 38.1%, combined iron deficiency and anemia of inflammation alone in 7.1%, vitamin B(12) deficiency in 7.1%, and others in 9.5%. Median iron intake was 5.7 mg/day (recommended dietary allowance 18-26 mg/day). Compared to nonanemic children, anemic children were more likely to be underweight (weight Z-score -2.5 vs. -1.9), stunted (height Z-score -2.6 vs. -1.9), with lower CD4 counts (18% vs. 24%, p < 0.01), and higher log viral load (11.1 vs. 7.1, p < 0.01). Hemoglobin (Hb) improved significantly among those who started ART (baseline Hb 11.6 g/dl, 6-month Hb 12.2 g/dl, p = 0.03).

This study developed and tested the feasibility and acceptability of a computer-based adaption of an empirically supported face-to-face adherence promotion intervention. HIV-positive individuals (N = 92) on antiretroviral therapy with self-reported adherence <95% were randomized to the electronic intervention + treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU only. Study outcome variables which included treatment self-efficacy and self-reported medication adherence were assessed at baseline and follow-up. Time × condition interaction effects in mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVAs) examined the differences in patterns of change in the outcome variables over time between the two groups. Participants in the electronic intervention condition reported higher levels of self-efficacy to adhere to their medication at follow-up compared to the control condition. Although nonsignificant, levels of adherence tended to improve over time in the intervention condition, while TAU adherence remained constant. This was the first study to investigate a single-session, computer-based adherence intervention. Results suggest that electronic interventions are feasible and this method may be effective at increasing self-efficacy and adherence among patients reporting suboptimal adherence levels."

In a country such as South Africa where rates of these infectious diseases are high, it is concerning that there is limited/no data on prevalence rates of mental disorders such as PTSD and its associated factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of PTSD symptoms and associated factors in TB, TB retreatment and/or TB-HIV co-infected primary public health-care patients in three districts in South Africa. Brief screening self-report tools were used to measure: PTSD symptoms, psychological distress (anxiety and depression) and alcohol misuse. Other relevant measures, such as adherence to medication, stressful life events and sexual risk-taking behaviours, were obtained through structured questions. A total of 4900 public primary care adult patients from clinics in high TB burden districts from three provinces in South Africa participated. All the patients screened positive for TB (either new or retreatment cases). The prevalence of PTSD symptoms was 29.6%. Patients who screened positive for PTSD symptoms and psychological distress were more likely to be on antidepressant medication. Factors that predicted PTSD symptoms were poverty, residing in an urban area, psychological distress, suicide attempt, alcohol and/or drug use before sex, unprotected sex, TB-HIV co-infected and the number of other chronic conditions. Health-care systems should be strengthened to improve delivery of mental health care, by focusing on existing programmes and activities, such as those which address the prevention and treatment of TB and HIV.

Participants provided behavioural and clinical data with genital and blood specimens for lab testing. Among 1063 women, 68.4% had been on antiretroviral therapy >1 year; 58.9% were using cotrimoxazole prophylaxis; 51 % had CD4+T-lymphocytes < 350 cells/µL. Most women (63.1%) reported at least one genital symptom. Clinical signs were found in 63% of women; and 30.8% had an aetiological diagnosis. Bacterial vaginosis (17.4%), vaginal candidiasis (10.6%) and trichomoniasis (10.5%) were the most common diagnoses. Using laboratory diagnoses as gold standard, sensitivity and positive predictive value of the syndromic diagnosis for vaginal discharge were 47.6% and 52.7%, respectively, indicating a substantial amount of overtreatment. A systematic physical examination increased by 9.3% the positive predictive value for genital ulcer disease. Women attending HIV care programmes in Kenya have high rates of vaginal infections. Syndromic diagnosis was a poor predictor of those infections. "

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of HCV treatments on the perceived physical, cognitive, and psychosocial impact of fatigue (Fatigue Impact Scale) among HIV-HCV coinfected patients. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 223 adult coinfected patients being followed-up in two clinical centers located in the south of France. Analysis was focused on patients who answered a self-administered questionnaire and who were being treated for their HIV infection (n=139). The cognitive, physical, and psychosocial impact of fatigue was significantly worse in patients also receiving HCV treatment (n=24) than in those receiving HIV treatment only (n=115). Along with depression, the number of self-reported treatment-related side effects was independently associated with fatigue scores after adjustment for all other characteristics. This number was significantly higher among patients on HCV treatment than among those who were not (relative risk [95% confidence interval]=1.4 [1.1; 1.7], P=0.002). In particular, skin or hair problems and general symptoms such as loss of appetite, loss of weight, fever, and headache were more prevalent among these patients. In conclusion, the combination of HIV and HCV treatments results in more self-reported side effects that exacerbate the perceived impact of fatigue among HIV-HCV coinfected patients. Effective follow-up of HCV-treated HIV-coinfected patients should, therefore, include close consideration and management of patients' subjective experience with treatments to reduce the burden of HCV-associated fatigue."

This report from Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, examines the risk factors for HIV transmission by 1 and 24 months among breast-feeding women. Eligible HIV-1-seropositive pregnant women enrolled in this randomized double-blind clinical trial were randomly assigned to receive either oral zidovudine (ZDV) (n = 126) prophylaxis or placebo (n = 124). Maternal prophylaxis began at 36 weeks of gestation (300 mg ZDV twice daily antepartum and 300 mg every 3 hours intrapartum); there was no neonatal prophylaxis component. The cumulative risk of transmission in the treatment group was 11.9% and 22.1% by 1 and 24 months, respectively. In adjusted analyses, viral load at enrollment was the strongest predictor of transmission (per log increment: odds ratio [OR] = 4.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5-9.5 at 1 month; OR = 5.7; 95% CI: 3.1-10.8 at 24 months). Overall, ZDV prophylaxis was not significantly protective for infection at 1 or 24 months. Comparing ZDV with placebo following dichotomization of viral load (<50,000 vs. > or =50,000 copies/mL) at enrollment, however, there was a significant effect of ZDV seen only among those women with a low viral load at enrollment. The substantial risk of transmission despite ZDV prophylaxis, particularly among those with higher viral loads, underscores the need to find more effective regimens appropriate for use in resource-limited settings."

Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for 53% of the estimated incident infections, and surveillance data suggest that the annual number of new HIV infections among MSM has been rising since the mid-1990s. Strategies for reducing acquisition of HIV infection by MSM have included 1) expanded HIV testing so that infected persons can be treated and their risk for transmitting infection minimized; 2) individual, small-group, and community-level behavioral interventions to reduce risk behaviors; 3) promotion of condom use; 4) detection and treatment of sexually transmitted infections; and 5) mental health and substance abuse counseling when needed. On November 23, 2010, investigators for the Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Initiative (iPrEX) study announced results from a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial of daily oral antiretrovirals (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF] and emtricitabine [FTC]) to prevent acquisition of HIV infection among uninfected but exposed MSM. This report provides interim guidance to health-care providers based on the reported results of that trial, which indicated that TDF plus FTC taken orally once a day as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is safe and partially effective in reducing HIV acquisition among MSM when provided with regular monitoring of HIV status and ongoing risk-reduction and PrEP medication adherence counseling."

We evaluated whether ESLD death was associated with premorbid HCV RNA level or specific HCV protein antibodies among persons with or without HIV/HTLV-II coinfection in a cohort of 6,570 injection drug users who enrolled in 9 US cities between 1987 and 1991. We compared 84 ESLD descendents and 305 randomly selected cohort participants with detectable HCV RNA, stratified by sex, race, HIV, and HTLV-II strata. Relative hazard (RH) of ESLD death was derived from the proportional hazard model. Risk of ESLD death was unrelated to the intensity of antibodies against the HCV c-22(p), c-33(p), c-100(p), and NS5 proteins, individually or combined, but it increased with HCV RNA level (RH(adj) = 2.26 per log(10) IU/mL, 95% CI: 1.45-5.92). The association between HCV RNA level and ESLD death remained significant after adjustment for alcohol consumption (RH(adj) = 2.57 per log(10) IU/mL, 95% CI: 1.50-8.10). Deaths from AIDS (n = 45) and other causes (n = 43) were unrelated to HCV RNA (RH(adj)= 1.14 and 1.29 per log(10) IU/mL, respectively). HIV infection was not associated with ESLD risk in multivariate analyses adjusted for HCV RNA. Men had an increased risk of ESLD death in unadjusted analyses (RH = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.15-3.56) but not in multivariate analysis (RH(adj) = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.48-2.88). Non-black patients were at increased risk for ESLD death (RH(adj)= 2.76, 95% CI: 1.49-10.09). In conclusion, HCV RNA level is a predictor of ESLD death among persons with chronic HCV infection."

Previous studies have suggested that HPV 16 would be relatively less important as a causative agent among HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative women. This study investigates HPV type-specific cervical cancer risk in a population in which HIV is endemic. At the Central Hospital, Maputo, Mozambique, 221 cervical cancer cases and 203 hospital-based controls were consecutively enrolled. HPV typing from cervical samples, HIV testing and recording of socio-demographic factors were performed. Logistic regression modelling was used to assess HPV type-specific risk and effect modification between HIV and HPV infection. Infection with HPV 16, 18 and 'high-risk non-HPV 16/18 types' (HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58 and 59) was associated with cervical cancer in both crude and adjusted analyses. HPV 16 and 18 were the most common types detected in cancer biopsies among both HIV-negative and HIV-positive women. There was no significant evidence of effect modification between any HPV type and HIV infection, and there were no significant differences in the HPV type-specific prevalence when cervical cancers among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women were compared. Within the limitations of the study, the relative importance of different HPV types in cervical carcinogenesis appears not to be modified greatly by HIV infection, suggesting that HPV vaccines might not need to be type-specifically modified to be suitable for populations where HIV is endemic."

To clarify these relationships, 42 hemophilic patients who developed ESLD and random samples from 164 hemophilic patients with HCV infection alone and 146 with HCV-HIV coinfection were tested for HCV load and genotype. HCV genotype was unrelated to HIV and age. In contrast, HCV load was higher with older age (P(trend)=.0001) and with HIV coinfection (6.2 vs. 5.9 log(10) genome equivalents/mL, P=.0001). During 16 years of follow-up of dually infected patients, ESLD risk was unrelated to HCV load overall (P(trend)=.64) or separately to HCV genotype 1 and genotypes 2 or 3 (P(trend)> or =.70). Irrespective of virus load, incidence of ESLD was marginally increased 2-fold (95% confidence interval, 0.8-5.6) with HCV genotype 1. Understanding the discordance between HCV load and ESLD, despite HIV's link to each of these, may help clarify the pathogenesis of HCV-related disease."

The clinical significance of T. marneffei became evident when the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic arrived in Southeast Asia in 1988. Subsequently, a decline in the incidence of T. marneffei infection among HIV-infected patients was seen in regions with access to highly active antiretroviral therapy and other control measures for HIV. Since the 1990s, an increasing number of T. marneffei infections have been reported among non-HIV-infected patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity. Their comorbidities included primary adult-onset immunodeficiency due to anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies and secondary immunosuppressive conditions including other autoimmune diseases, solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantations, T-lymphocyte-depleting immunsuppressive drugs and novel anti-cancer targeted therapies such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and kinase inhibitors. Moreover, improved immunological diagnostics identified more primary immunodeficiency syndromes associated with T. marneffei infection in children. The higher case-fatality rate of T. marneffei infection in non-HIV-infected than HIV-infected patients might be related to delayed diagnosis due to the lack of clinical suspicion. Correction of the underlying immune defects and early use of antifungals are important treatment strategies. Clinicians should be familiar with the changing epidemiology and clinical management of T. marneffei infection among non-HIV-infected patients. "

Effector CD8(+) T cells play a crucial role in the control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and HIV-1 infection in coinfected patients. Adoptive transfer of a multitude of effector CD8(+) T cells is an appealing strategy to impose improved anti-MTB/HIV-1 activity onto coinfected individuals. Due to extensive existence of heterologous immunity, that is, T cells cross-reactive with peptides encoded by related or even very dissimilar pathogens, it is reasonable to find a single T cell receptor (TCR) recognizing both MTB and HIV-1 antigenic peptides. In this study, a single TCR specific for both MTB Ag85B199-207 peptide and HIV-1 Env120-128 peptide was screened out from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a HLA-A*0201(+) healthy individual using complementarity determining region 3 spectratype analysis and transferred to primary CD8(+) T cells using a recombinant retroviral vector. The bispecificity of the TCR gene-modified CD8(+) T cells was demonstrated by elevated secretion of interferon-γ, tumour necrosis factor-α, granzyme B and specific cytolytic activity after antigen presentation of either Ag85B199-207 or Env120-128 by autologous dendritic cells. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report proposing to produce responses against two dissimilar antigenic peptides of MTB and HIV-1 simultaneously by transfecting CD8(+) T cells with a single TCR. Taken together, T cells transduced with the additional bispecific TCR might be a useful strategy in immunotherapy for MTB/HIV-1 coinfected individuals."

This included a blood donor who was initially asymptomatic but subsequently developed AIDS-related complex and two neonatal transfusion recipients who developed AIDS. Isolates from brain and lung replicated to greater than 30-fold higher levels in primary monocyte cultures than did those from blood; no growth differences on primary lymphocytes were observed. Thirteen clones were obtained from seven isolates, and env sequences were determined. The predicted amino acid sequences among these clones differed by only 0.01% but differed by 15-27% when compared to previously sequenced isolates from other patients. The level of envelope amino acid sequence divergence noted among these isolates is considerably lower than that previously reported for other human immunodeficiency virus isolates. No differences in the envelope unique to lung or brain isolates compared to blood isolates were noted. This study provides evidence that mutations in the envelope may not be necessary for disease progression and that other portions of the viral genome may contribute to cell-specific tropism."

Data reported by Verdichio-Moraes et al. (2009: J. Med Virol 81:757-759) were used as the non-infected and HCV monoinfected groups. Human Platelet Polymorphism genotyping was performed in 60 Patients co-infected with HIV/HCV by PCR-SSP or PCR-RFLP. HIV subtyping and HCV genotyping was performed by RT-PCR followed sequencing. The data analyses were performed using the χ2 test or Fisher's Exact Test and the logistic regression model. Patients coinfected with HIV/HCV presented HCV either genotype 1 (78.3%) or non-1 (21.7%) and HIV either subtype B (85.0%) or non-B (15%). The Human Platelet Polymorphism-1a/1b genotype was more frequent (P < 0.05) in HIV/HCV coinfection than in HCV monoinfection and the allelic frequency of Human Platelet Polymorphism-5b in the Patients coinfected with HIV/HCV was higher (P < 0.05) than in HCV monoinfected cases and non-infected individuals. These data suggest that the presence of specific HPA allele on platelets could favor the existence of coinfection. On the other hand, Human Platelet Polymorphism-5a/5b was more frequent (P < 0.05) in HIV/HCV coinfected and HCV monoinfected groups than in the non-infected individuals, suggesting that this platelet genotype is related to HCV infection, regardless of HIV presence. Results suggest that the Human Platelet Polymorphism profile in HIV/HCV coinfected individuals differs from the one of both HCV monoinfected and non-infected population. So, the Human Platelet Polymorphism can be a genetic marker associated with HIV/HCV coinfection."

All subjects included for study had positive baseline HIV cultures. Cultures were performed in real time with 10(7) fresh patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells, using the ACTG consensus method. We found lower rates of positive HIV cultures in the indinavir treatment arm than in the dual-nucleoside treatment arm (64 versus 96% at week 24, P < 0.001). Within the indinavir arm of the study, we found that positive cultures were less likely to occur in samples with a plasma HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA level of <500 copies/ml than in those with a level of >or=500 copies/ml (44 versus 90%, P < 0.001). In addition, HIV cultures from samples with HIV-1 RNA levels of >or=500 copies/ml turned positive 8.5 days earlier, on average, than those from samples with levels of <500 copies/ml (P < 0.001). However, 38% of samples with plasma RNA levels of <50 copies/ml still were positive for HIV by culture. Thus, the rates of HIV isolation by standard culture procedures decrease as the plasma viral load decreases below 1,000 copies/ml; however, HIV isolates were still obtained from a substantial proportion of subjects with RNA levels of <50 copies/ml. The delay in the time required for HIV cultures to turn positive should be considered when attempting to obtain an HIV isolate from patients with suppression of plasma viral load."

One month after the last booster inoculation, the animals were challenged by intravenous injection of cell-associated virus in the form of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from an HIV-1[IIIB(LAI)]-infected chimpanzee. One chimpanzee with a neutralizing antibody titer to HIV-1[IIIB(LAI)] of 128 at the time of challenge was protected, whereas both the second animal, with a neutralizing antibody titer of 32, and a naive control animal became infected. At 5 months after challenge, the protected chimpanzee and a third animal, previously immunized with various HIV-1[MN] antigens, were given a booster inoculation. The two animals were challenged intravenously 5 weeks later with twenty 50% tissue culture infectious doses of cell-free HIV-1[DH12], a heterologous subtype B isolate. Neither chimpanzee had neutralizing antibodies to HIV-1[DH12], and neither one was protected from infection with this isolate.

All the same, this restoration of immune response in some may be associated with deterioration in clinical status, which has been termed immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). This syndrome often occurs in the context of an underlying opportunistic infection and develops after an interval of weeks to months after the initiation of HAART. Occasionally, IRIS may occur in the brain without any opportunistic infection, which presents as a T cell-mediated encephalitis. This paradoxical infiltration of previously immune suppressed patients with T cells represents a diagnostic challenge and a treatment dilemma. Nonetheless, CNS-IRIS with or without an opportunistic infection can range in severity. Severe cases can be fatal and hence require intervention with steroid treatment. This review discusses the diagnosis, clinical manifestations, risk factors, pathophysiology, and potential treatment strategies of the various forms of IRIS that involve the nervous system."

We studied HEV parameters [HEV RNA, HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM), and HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmatory immunoblotting] in a cohort of 285 adult liver transplant recipients. The most recent freeze-stored sera were investigated, and if they were positive, a retrospective analysis was performed. Samples from 274 patients (96.1%) tested negative for all HEV parameters. This included a patient described earlier as having experienced an episode of chronic HEV hepatitis in the past. One patient was found positive for HEV RNA without HEV antibodies. She presently suffers from chronic HEV hepatitis and has also been described before. Sera from 9 patients tested positive for HEV IgG without HEV IgM or HEV RNA. Six of these 9 patients (2.1% of the total) were found to have HEV IgG antibodies in retrospect related to an HEV infection at some time pre-transplant as they also tested positive in a pretransplant serum sample. One of these 9 patients suffered in retrospect from a chronic HEV infection with mild hepatitis between 2 and 5 years after liver transplantation on the basis of the course of HEV RNA, IgM, and IgG, aminotransferases, and liver histology. Overall, the prevalence of acquired HEV hepatitis after liver transplantation was 1% in this cohort.

Lamivudine should no longer be used as a single anti-HBV agent in HIV-HBV co-infected patients, given its limited antiviral potency and high risk of selection of resistance, which further results in wide cross-resistance to all other nucleoside analogues. Recent reports of transmission of lamivudine-resistant HBV in HIV patients are of especial concern, and large surveillance studies suggest that it may occur in up to 10% of new HBV infections in Western countries. Another worrisome aspect of the selection of lamivudine-resistant HBV is the potential for selection of vaccine escape mutants. Currently, tenofovir must be viewed as the drug of choice in HIV-HBV co-infected patients in whom antiretroviral therapy is advised. Its co-formulation with emtricitabine (Truvada) is particularly convenient for treating both HIV and HBV in co-infected individuals. While pegIFN-alpha monotherapy for 1 year may be considered for HIV-HBV coinfected individuals with good spontaneous HIV control (elevated CD4 cell count, low plasma HIV-RNA), and certain HBV features (genotype A, HBeAg+, low serum HBV-DNA and elevated ALT), it is clear that very few coinfected patients fulfill these criteria. In HBeAg-negative HIV patients, adefovir may be an option but the relatively low antiviral potency of this drug discourages its wide use. Given its potential anti-HIV activity, both entecavir and telbivudine must only be prescribed with antiretroviral agents. Lack of information about potential pharmacodynamic interactions between entecavir and abacavir (both are guanosine analogues) or between telbivudine and zidovudine or stavudine (all are thymidine analogues) further discourages their concomitant use. At this time, most experts agree that early introduction of anti-HBV active HAART is the best strategy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in HIV patients, and Truvada must be part of the triple regimen."

A total of 236 chronic HBV patients were included and consisted of 63 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 87 liver cirrhosis (LC) and 86 chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The mRNA level of A20 gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Receptor operating characteristic curve (ROC) was performed to determine the diagnostic value of A20 mRNA in different stages of chronic HBV infection. A20 mRNA levels in all HBV patients were significantly higher than healthy controls (n=30), of whom HCC and LC patients showed higher A20 mRNA level than CHB patients. In CHB patients, A20 mRNA was closely associated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin. In LC patients, A20 mRNA was significantly associated with ALT, AST, albumin, haemoglobin and platelet. In HCC patients, elevated A20mRNA was also observed in patients with vascular invasion, liver cirrhosis and ascites, compared with those without. ROC analysis revealed that A20 mRNA could effectively discriminate LC from CHB, decompensated LC from compensated LC, and HCC from CHB. In conclusion, A20 mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was associated with dynamic progression of chronic HBV infection. A20 gene might be a potential biomarker to determine the different stages of chronic HBV infection."

By this procedure, persistent infections were established in some chimpanzees with various infectious doses of either cell-associated HIV-1LAI(IIIB) (peripheral blood mononuclear cells from an infected chimpanzee) or with cell-free HIV-1 strains representing subtypes B and E, but not with a subtype A strain. Although some animals did not become infected until after the second or third cervicovaginal exposure, one chimpanzee was clearly infected after one exposure by several criteria, including virus isolation, but this animal did not seroconvert. A second chimpanzee appeared to be resistant to infection despite repeated mucosal exposures at irregular intervals. However, lymphocytes from both of these animals exhibited low-level proliferative responses to HIV-1 but not SIV antigens. Despite these apparently abortive or latent infections, after exposure to HIV-1 by the intravenous route, both animals developed systemic infections and seroconverted. Overall, 8 of 10 chimpanzees were infected systemically after one to three cervicovaginal exposures to HIV-1LAI(IIIB). The results indicate that (1) HIV-1 productive infection of female chimpanzees by the cervicovaginal route generally requires more than one exposure, just as with humans; (2) low level infections without seroconversion can be established after mucosal exposure to HIV; and (3) vaccine efficacy studies involving a single virus challenge of immunized chimpanzees by the cervicovaginal route probably will not be possible."

Phylogenetic and nucleotide distance analyses were performed by using database sequences representing North American strains collected from 1978 to 1995. The estimated phylogeny was starlike, with early strains represented on different lineages. When sequences were grouped by years of collection, nucleotide distance comparisons demonstrated an increase in diversity over time and indicated that contemporary strains are more closely related to early epidemic strains than to each other. Using a recently developed likelihood ratio reduction procedure, the date of origin of the U.S. epidemic was estimated to be 1968 +/- 1.4 years. A coalescent approach was also used to estimate the population history of the U.S. subtype B epidemic. Our analyses provide new information that implies an exponential growth rate from the beginning of the U.S. HIV epidemic. The dating results suggest a U.S. introduction date (or date of divergence from the most recent common ancestor) that precedes the date of the earliest known AIDS cases in the late 1970s. Furthermore, the estimated epidemic growth curve shows a period of exponential growth that preceded most of the early documented cases and also indicates a leveling of prevalence rates in the recent past."

Peripheral blood CD8(+) T cells were obtained from 20 patients treated with lamivudine or telbivudine for chronic hepatitis B at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. The CDR3 spectratype of each T cell receptor (TCR) β chain variable region (Vβ) gene family was analyzed, and the changes in the numbers of Vβ families with clonal expansions were compared in subjects with (n = 12) and without (n = 8) a virological response (52 week HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml). The number of CD8(+) TCR Vβ families with clonal expansions at 12 weeks relative to baseline (median [10th to 90th percentile], +2.5 [0 to +7] versus +1 [0 to +2], P = 0.03) and at 24 weeks relative to 12 weeks (+1 [0 to +2] versus -1 [-3 to +4], P = 0.006) was higher in subjects with a virological response versus subjects without a virological response, as were interleukin-2 (IL-2) but not IL-21 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The duration of new expansions at 12 weeks was higher (P < 0.0001) in responders. Increased numbers of CD8(+) T cell expansions after antiviral therapy are associated with a virological response to treatment. These CD8(+) T cells are a potential target for a therapeutic vaccine for chronic hepatitis B."

The authors performed a cohort study of HTLV-I infection and cause-specific mortality in 3,090 atomic-bomb survivors in Nagasaki, Japan, who were followed from 1985-1987 to 1995. The prevalence of HTLV-I seropositivity in men and women was 99/1,196 (8.3%) and 171/1,894 (9.0%), respectively. During a median follow-up of 8.9 years, 448 deaths occurred. There was one nonfatal case of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (incidence rate = 0.46 cases/1,000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-2.6). After adjustment for sex, age and other potential confounders, significantly increased risk among HTLV-I carriers was observed for deaths from all causes (rate ratio [RR] = 1.41), all cancers (RR = 1.64), liver cancer (RR = 3.04), and heart diseases (RR = 2.22). The association of anti-HTLV-I seropositivity with mortality from all non-neoplastic diseases (RR = 1.40) and chronic liver diseases (RR = 5.03) was of borderline significance. Possible confounding by blood transfusions and hepatitis C/B (HCV/HBV) viral infections could not be precluded in this study. However, even after liver cancer and chronic liver diseases were excluded, mortality rate was still increased among HTLV-I carriers (RR = 1.32, 95% CI 0.99-1.78), especially among those with high antibody titers (RR = 1.56, 95% CI 0.99-2.46, P for trend = 0.04). These findings may support the idea that HTLV-I infection exerts adverse effects on mortality from causes other than adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Further studies on confounding by HCV/HBV infections and the interaction between HCV/HBV and HTLV-I may be required to analyze the increased mortality from liver cancer and chronic liver diseases."

Whether a complete response to antiviral therapy is associated with protective immunity against reinfection with HCV remains unknown. We describe a patient who had a sustained biochemical and virologic response with loss of intrahepatic HCV RNA after a course of combination therapy using interferon plus ribavirin. Histopathologically, the chronic hepatitis was in remission on follow-up biopsy 6 months post-therapy. Unfortunately, 34 weeks post-therapy, a flare of hepatitis with reappearance of hepatitis C viremia was noted 2 months after he received injections from a non-licensed medical provider. Analysis of the core gene sequences showed a 95% homology between the HCV strains isolated before antiviral treatment and during the hepatitis flare. The data indicated that the hepatitis flare after a period of sustained response to combination therapy in this patient could have been caused by reinfection with homotypic HCV. Our observation indicates the lack of protective immunity against reinfection with HCV in patients with chronic hepatitis C, even after successful clearance of the virus. Therefore, reinforcing the education of these subjects to avoid HCV reinfection should be stressed."

After the end of hemodialysis, antiviral therapy was resumed with abacavir (300 mg×2/day), lamivudine (300 mg every day), and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily). Renal biopsy revealed severe and diffuse toxic acute tubular necrosis Two years after tenofovir discontinuation, the patient's renal function remained subnormal. Although severe renal toxicity due to tenofovir is rare, patients receiving tenofovir must be monitored closely for renal dysfunction especially during the first weeks of tenofovir therapy."

A total of 540 individuals on antiretroviral therapy attending 18 different outclinics in Spain were examined in a cross-sectional study conducted during June 2000. The overall rate of virologic failure (>50 HIV RNA copies/ml) was 54%. Among the subjects showing treatment failure, 79% harbored resistant HIV genotypes, 77% showed resistance to nucleoside analogues, 53% showed resistance to protease inhibitors, and 42% showed resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Overall, 78.5% of individuals harbored HIV strains which showed resistance to two or more drug classes. Moreover, nucleotide substitutions causing broad cross-resistance among compounds within each drug family were quite common. These findings suggest that drug resistance mutations are very prevalent among subjects who have experienced several treatment failures. Therefore, facilitating the arrival of compounds belonging to new drug classes should be considered a priority."

Eligible patients were those enrolled in a national prospective observational cohort (Antiretroviral Resistance Cohort Analysis), starting first-line cART between 2001 and 2011 and who had at least one follow-up of HIV-1 RNA. The primary endpoint was virological success, defined as the first viral load <50  copies/ml. Time to events were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard model. One thousand three hundred five patients met the study inclusion criteria. In a multivariable model adjusting for transmission mode, presence of transmitted drug resistance, baseline CD4(+) cell count, viral subtype, and type of NRTI backbone employed, independent predictors of virological success were higher baseline viral load (≥500,000 vs. <100,000 HR 0.52; P < 0.001), a weighted genotypic susceptibility score (wGSS) <3 (HR 0.58; P = 0.003), male sex (HR 0.76 P = 0.001), and type of initial third drug employed (integrase inhibitor vs. boosted protease inhibitors HR 3.23; P < 0.001). In the subset with HIV-1 RNA >100,000  copies/ml, virologic success was only associated with the use of integrase inhibitors in the first cART regimen. Independent predictors of immunological success were baseline CD4(+) cell count and wGSS <3. High baseline HIV-1 RNA, predicted activity of the first-line regimen based on genotypic resistance testing, gender, and use of new agents were found to predict time to achieve virological success.

To study such events, we developed a murine model of HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE), the pathological equivalent of HAD. Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice injected with HIV-1-infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) into basal ganglia exhibited many of the pathological features of human HIVE. Moreover, behavioral and cognitive abnormalities in the HIVE mice were associated with neuronal dysfunction and decreased synaptic density. Thus, the rationale for testing novel therapeutic approaches (anti-inflammatory, antiretroviral, or neuroprotective) in the HIVE SCID mice is clear. Animals treated with anti-inflammatory compounds (platelet-activating factor [PAF] antagonist and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha release inhibitor) showed a marked reduction in brain inflammation and a reduction in neuronal injury. Comparative analyses of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens provided direction for which one might be most efficient for reduction of viral load in infected brain tissue. Moreover, modifications of the HIVE model might serve as a vehicle for testing vaccine approaches. Reconstitution of immunodeficient animals with syngeneic T lymphocytes followed by injection of HIV-1-infected MDMs in the brain resulted in cytotoxic antivirus T lymphocyte (CTL) response. CD8-positive T cells migrated to the sites of human MDMs, leading to the cell-mediated destruction of HIV-1 infected MDMs. These results, taken together, strongly support the use of HIVE SCID mouse model as a novel system for studies of the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 infection, as well as for testing novel therapeutic and vaccine interventions for human disease."

Due to HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) having similar transmission routes, HBV and HIV infections among injecting drug users (IDUs) has become an important public health issue. The aim of this study was explore the prevalence of HBV infection among IDUs with and without HIV infection, and examine whether HIV infection is associated with HBV infection among IDUs in Southern Taiwan. We enrolled 566 IDUs, including 87 anti-HBV positive IDUs and 479 anti-HBV negative IDUs, and also analyzed the results of liver function tests, HBV DNA, anti-HIV, HIV RNA, and CD4 cell count. The results showed that the prevalence of HBV infection among IDUs was 15.4%. The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was higher among individuals born before 1985 (15.9% vs. 4.0%), but this was not significant. Anti-HIV seropositivity was related to HBsAg seropositivity [odds ratio (OR) = 2.47, 95% confidence interval = 1.26-4.82, p = 0.008). Anti-HCV and anti-HIV were risk factors for abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT; OR = 2.11, 95% confidence interval = 1.005-4.42, p = 0.048 and OR = 1.47, 95% confidence interval = 1.02-2.10, p = 0.04, respectively), and HBsAg was not a factor related to abnormal ALT. In conclusion, the prevalence of HBV infection was similar in the general population and in IDUs, and due to anti-HIV seropositivity being significantly related to HBsAg seropositivity, HBV infection among IDUs is still important. We suggest that for IDUs, HBsAg should be monitored closely."

This study is a cross-sectional analyze of 29 HTLV-1-infected patients with TSP/HAM or asymptomatic carriers. Proviral DNA from those subjects was submitted to a nested PCR for the HTLV-1 LTR5' region. The HTLV-1 LTR5' purified products were submitted to deep sequencing using the Ion Torrent sequencing technology (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). We found that samples with low proviral load showed more detected minor mutations than the samples with high proviral load. Mutations in 136 positions were found over the 520-bp analyzed fragment of HTLV-1 LTR5' with at least 1% frequency. Eleven mutations were present in the previously determined major transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and in more than one patient, indicating that there might be a differential HTLV-1 expression comparing individuals or in comparing different cells from the same individual. Three mutations were statistically significant using the Fisher nonparametric test between the groups but were not present in previously determined TFBS (G126C/T, G306C, and C479T). Those mutations that were not present in previously determined TFBS were statistically significant in this study and were most frequent in patients with low proviral load or in asymptomatic carriers. Although those mutations were not present in previously determined TFBS, one of those mutations (G306C/A) was present in an Sp-1 binding site determined by in silico analysis, and its presence abrogated the site for Sp-1 binding and created a new possible ATF binding site.

In the concentrated HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgendered women (TGW) in Lima, Peru, the independent correlates of ART nonadherence were examined to inform treatment intervention priorities. Cross sectional survey of HIV-infected MSM and TGW who are engaged in clinical care in Lima, Peru. From June to August 2012, 302 HIV-infected Peruvian MSM/TGW from three clinical care sites were recruited using convenience sampling to participate in a cross-sectional computer-assisted adherence survey. Several standardized screening measures associated with ART nonadherence were examined in order to determine the independent correlates of optimal (≥90%) and perfect (100%) adherence, which were assessed using logistic regression. Of the 302 participants recruited, 263 (87.1%) were prescribed ART. Among those prescribed ART, 229 (87.1%) reported optimal and 146 (55.5%) reported perfect adherence. The prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUD; 43.2%), alcohol dependence (5.3%), recent drug use (6.0%), and depression (44.5%) was high, and most participants had some evidence of neurocognitive impairment. Meeting criteria for having an AUD and depression were collinear (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, having an AUD was inversely related and the only independent correlate of optimal (AOR = 0.427; 95% CI = 0.187-0.976) and perfect (AOR = 0.552; 95% CI = 0.327-0.930) ART adherence. AUDs are highly prevalent among Peruvian HIV-infected MSM and contribute significantly to ART nonadherence. These findings support the need for screening and treating underlying AUDs. In order to meet HIV TasP goals, evidence-based strategies targeting AUDs are likely to directly improve ART adherence and indirectly improve overall individual health, HIV treatment engagement, and reduce transmission to sexual partners among this vulnerable and disproportionally affected population."

A chronic increase in inducible tryptophan oxidation is the basis of HIV-1-associated tryptophan depletion. This metabolic process results in the irretrievable loss of tryptophan molecules from the available pool. Such sustained disruption of normal tryptophan metabolism over time disturbs the many metabolic processes involving this amino acid, and has been implicated in some features of AIDS pathogenesis. Normal T-cell function is adversely affected by tryptophan depletion, but the extent of the effect in HIV-1-infected patients is still unclear. Attempting to directly supplement tryptophan is not advised given the potential increase in circulating concentrations of neurotoxic intermediates. Although only preliminary data are available, evidence suggests that antiretroviral and nicotinamide treatments can boost plasma tryptophan concentrations in HIV-1-infected patients and impact the secondary effects of tryptophan depletion. Additional study of this metabolism could lead to improved treatment strategies for patients with HIV infection. In this review I focus on the potential links between disturbed tryptophan metabolism and pathogenesis."
14198,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections remain a major public health problem worldwide. According to World Health Organization estimates, more than 300 million people are chronically infected and exposed to the risk of developing severe complications including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Major progress in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) has been made during the last decade with the development of antivirals that inhibit viral polymerase activity. Antiviral drug resistance is an important factor in determining the success of long-term therapy for CHB. The development of resistance to nucleoside analogues (NUCs) has been associated with exacerbations of liver disease. Sequential therapy increases the risk of the emergence of multidrug resistance. The selection of a potent antiviral with a high barrier to resistance as a first-line therapy provides the best chance of achieving long-term treatment goals and should be used whenever possible. This has led to a significant decrease in drug resistance in countries where this strategy is affordable. However, the barrier to resistance of a given antiviral agent is influenced by the genetic barrier, drug potency, patient adherence, pharmacological barrier, viral fitness, the drug mechanisms of action and cross resistance. Furthermore, because of specific viral kinetics, prolonged treatment with NUCs does not result in the clearance of the viral genome from the infected liver. It is therefore important to continue research to identify new viral and immune targets and develop novel antiviral strategies for controlling viral replication as well as preventing drug resistance and its complications in the long term."

These effects are not completely reversed by antiretroviral treatment (ART). To further elucidate B-cell changes during chronic SIV infection and treatment, we investigated memory B-cell subpopulations and plasma cells/plasmablasts (PC/PB) in blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes of rhesus macaques during ART and upon release from ART. Macaques previously immunized with SIV recombinants and the gp120 protein were included to assess the effects of prior vaccination. ART was administered for 11 weeks, with or without gp120 boosting at week 9. Naïve and resting, activated, and tissue-like memory B cells and PC/PB were evaluated by flow cytometry. Antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and serum antibody titers were assessed. No lasting changes in B-cell memory subpopulations occurred in bone marrow and lymph nodes, but significant decreases in numbers of activated memory B cells and increases in numbers of tissue-like memory B cells persisted in PBMC. Macaque PC/PB were found to be either CD27(+) or CD27(-) and therefore were defined as CD19(+) CD38(hi) CD138(+). The numbers of these PC/PB were transiently increased in both PBMC and bone marrow following gp120 boosting of the unvaccinated and vaccinated macaque groups. Similarly, ASC numbers in PBMC and bone marrow of the two macaque groups also transiently increased following envelope boosting. Nevertheless, serum binding titers against SIVgp120 remained unchanged. Thus, even during chronic SIV infection, B cells respond to antigen, but long-term memory does not develop, perhaps due to germinal center destruction. Earlier and/or prolonged treatment to allow the generation of virus-specific long-term memory B cells should benefit ART/therapeutic vaccination regimens."

We wish to report a single paediatric haemophilia treatment center's results of treatment of adolescents with haemophilia and hepatitis C infection with combination therapy. All patients followed at the haemophilia treatment center with hepatitis C, who were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and had a measurable hepatitis C viral load were eligible. Study patients received at least 6 months of 3 MU interferon-alpha via subcutaneous injection three times per week and 1000 mg day(-1) of ribavirin. Eleven patients agreed to participate in the study. Three patients had an un measurable viral load after 6 months of combination therapy. All three completed 12 months of medication and continued to remain free of hepatitis C for 12 months after discontinuation of therapy. Side-effects of combination therapy were significant but tolerable. The sustained response rate in this study is similar to the historical response rate seen in adults but less than the other reported response rates seen in children treated with combination therapy. Given the toxicity of combination therapy, and natural history of hepatitis C infection in children, consideration of a liver biopsy to evaluate disease progression prior to considering antiviral medications is warranted."

The decreasing risk of suffering from opportunistic infections and tumors, however, is at the cost of antiretroviral drug-related toxicities. Today, mortality by liver disease is the major cause of death in HIV-infected patients from industrial countries. In the US and Europe about 30% of HIV-positive individuals are also infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and approximately 50-90% of persons who acquired HIV from injecting drugs are coinfected with HCV. In these dually infected individuals the presence of each viral infection impacts the natural history of the other one, and worsening of associated liver disease and complications within this population are increasing. The management of chronic hepatitis C (cHC) in HCV-HIV coinfection has become a major challenge, since possible interactions with antiretroviral therapies, increased risk of special side effects and compromises in adherence in patients already taking several drugs have to be taken into account. On the other hand, treatment strategies to fight HCV have been essentially ameliorated during the past 2 years by using pegylated interferon-alpha2b (Peg-IFN-alpha2b) combined with ribavirin, and there is hope that the successful therapeutic outcome in HCV-monoinfected individuals may beat least partly translated into benefits for the difficult-to-treat population of HCV-HIV dually infected persons. During the 15th International AIDS Conference in July 2002 in Barcelona, a satellite symposium, as well as a session in the main program and a number of poster presentations focussed on HCV-HIV coinfection and addressed the urgent problems and therapeutic challenges in managing cHC in the situation of underlying HIV disease."

Both treatments were clinically effective: 98% of evaluable fluconazole-treated patients and 94% of evaluable clotrimazole-treated patients were cured or showed improvement (p = NS). Fluconazole was more effective than clotrimazole in eradicating Candida from the oral flora by the end of therapy (65% versus 48%) (p = 0.005). In addition, patients in the fluconazole-treated group were more likely to remain asymptomatic through the second week of follow-up (82.3% versus 50.0%) (p < 0.001). This difference was no longer evident by the post-therapy visit during week 4. Seven patients treated with clotrimazole and two patients treated with fluconazole discontinued therapy because of side effects. Two patients in the fluconazole group were withdrawn from therapy because of elevated serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase levels, one considered possibly related to drug therapy. Fluconazole was as effective as clotrimazole in the treatment of oral candidiasis and temporarily provided a more prolonged disease-free state. Future studies are needed to define the optimal regimen for both the treatment and prevention of recurrent oral candidiasis in HIV-infected patients, addressing special attention to the issue of compliance, cost, and emergence of resistance."

There have been a number of strategies that the global AIDS community and countries have utilized to reduce prices and make antiretrovirals (ARVs) accessible for people living with HIV/AIDS. There appears to be an opportunity for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection using direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) to benefit from the often painful and laboured history of driving down the prices of ARVs. In general, the success of lowering prices for ARVs has stemmed from the politics needed to initially support generic entry into the on-patent market. The use of flexibilities present in the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) have been used to overcome patent barriers, with the use of compulsory licenses and/or the threat of their use as instruments for strengthening the bargaining power in price negotiations. These strategies have been combined with new financing mechanisms that have promoted more effective procurement and price negotiations. Partnership among the different stakeholders has also been critical in this regard. Countries have also invested in their health systems and implemented several strategies to reduce stigma and discrimination to increase access to and improve utilization of ARVs. This article suggests that any future international initiatives to increase access to DAAs can learn from these lessons surrounding price reduction, improved financing, advocacy, as well as health systems strengthening and stigma reduction. Adopting and reconfiguring these strategies will also incur substantial savings in time, money and lives."

This study examined how 16 individuals living with HIV sought out information to meet their health needs. In qualitative semi-structured interviews, we explored participants' primary sources of information, types of information sought, and barriers to accessing information. The sample was comprised of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who resided in a predominantly rural area with low HIV prevalence. The majority of participants relied on a combination of sources including their HIV/AIDS physician, the Internet, a Ryan-White caseworker and a staff member of a community-based support organization to meet their informational needs. Information sought focused primarily on drug regimens, drug side effects, or drug research. Participants shared barriers to accessing information including stigma, fear, concern about disclosure, and feelings of futility and anger. Findings point to a need to expand health literacy research and interventions to address broader social and structural barriers to health improvement for PLWHA, especially among those living in rural and low HIV prevalence areas."

According to a recently published case-control study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the following factors increase the risk of HIV seroconversion in HCWs after percutaneous exposure to HIV-infected blood: deep injury, visible blood on the device, procedures involving needle placement directly into a vein or artery, and terminal AIDS in the source patient. Postexposure use of zidovudine by HCWs appears to reduce the risk of HIV transmission by 79%. Institutions seeking to reduce the risk of HCW seroconversion should conduct analyses of specific tasks associated with these high-risk factors, and safety interventions should be installed when tasks and devices increase the risk of seroconversion. Although this type of outcome-based strategy may not significantly reduce the total number of needlestick injuries, reducing high-risk exposures minimizes disease transmission and maximizes the cost-effectiveness of the intervention."
9795,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The appropriate adoption of a policy of opt-out universal testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will likely increase the number of new HIV-infected patients seeking care by at least 25% over the next several years. On the basis of recent analyses, this policy will save lives and reduce medical care costs. However, the majority of clinics are currently operating at maximum capacity and cannot absorb the influx of newly identified patients. Therefore, the implementation of the policy of opt-out testing will expose deficiencies in clinic capacity and will likely precipitate a crisis in health care access and delivery for patients seeking care at these clinics. A comprehensive assessment of the funding requirements of existing HIV clinics is urgently needed, and sufficient resources must be appropriated to ensure that existing clinics can expand their capacity to absorb the onslaught of HIV-infected patients newly identified via the opt-out testing policy."

Preventing the development of neurocognitive abnormalities has become an increasingly important issue in this aging patient population, which is already at risk for cognitive impairment as a result of the neuropathological effects of HIV. cART has been critical in reducing the overall severity of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), but numerous challenges remain, as the prevalence of HAND continues to be high. There are several key areas in which treatment could be improved to reduce the incidence and severity of HAND. The use of well-tolerated cART medications that are able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier hold particular promise, as these agents may enable increased viral suppression in the parenchyma and may reduce neurocognitive dysfunction. In addition, the improved treatment of comorbid medical conditions that are common in patient populations with HIV (eg, HCV, liver failure and metabolic syndrome) is critical, as several of these conditions are known to have a significant effect on neural functions. Various research approaches indicate that the development of agents that control free radicals, neurotoxicity, proinflammatory processes and apoptosis may also have substantial potential in this field."

To monitor HIV-associated behaviors and HIV prevalence among IDUs, CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System (NHBS) conducts interviews and HIV testing in selected metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). This report summarizes data from 10,073 IDUs interviewed and tested in 20 MSAs in 2009. Of IDUs tested, 9% had a positive HIV test result, and 45% of those testing positive were unaware of their infection. Among the 9,565 IDUs with HIV negative or unknown HIV status before the survey, 69% reported having unprotected vaginal sex, 34% reported sharing syringes, and 23% reported having unprotected heterosexual anal sex during the 12 previous months. Although these risk behavior prevalences appear to warrant increased access to HIV testing and prevention services, for the previous 12-month period, only 49% of the IDUs at risk for acquiring HIV infection reported having been tested for HIV, and 19% reported participating in a behavioral intervention. Increased HIV prevention and testing efforts are needed to further reduce HIV infections among IDUs."

During three years of follow-up, 19 men developed AIDS. Risk of AIDS was clearly predicted by the total number of circulating OKT4-positive lymphocytes (T4 count) at enrollment, while the corresponding T8 count was unrelated to subsequent AIDS development. Subjects in Manhattan had a higher risk of Kaposi's sarcoma than did subjects in Washington, DC, and the risk of AIDS tended to increase with numerous homosexual partners. Several of 40 potential cofactors defined ex post facto, including receptive fellatio, enemas, methaqualone use, and high levels of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen, appeared to be associated with Kaposi's sarcoma but not with Pneumocystis pneumonia. Our data suggest that potent cofactors for Pneumocystis pneumonia were not prominent, pointing to the need for effective drug therapies, particularly to reduce the high AIDS risk of persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection and low T4 counts."

Both phagocytic cell functions are precociously compromised in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects, thus leading to infectious and neurological complications in the late stages of disease. Among intracellular pathogens, emerging bacteria such as Bartonella henselae and Rhodococcus equi can cause peculiar clinical pictures, i.e. the bacillary parenchimal angiomatosis and a classical pyogranulomatous broncopneumonia, respectively. On the other hand, overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines (CKs) and, in particular, tumor necrosis factor-alpha under HIV or lipopolysaccharide stimulation may cause neural damage in terms of demyelination and subsequent development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex. Some therapeutical attempts have been made with colony stimulating factors in order to increase the number and potentiate the function of PMN and M/M. On the other hand, the use of drugs able to reduce exaggerated release of CKs by M/M is suggested in AIDS patients in order to prevent a further aggravation of the clinical condition."

First-generation phenotypic assays possess a number of drawbacks, not least the selection of unrepresentative virus populations during cocultivation. Here we describe a rapid phenotypic assay for the assessment of the susceptibility of clinical isolates to reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors. This procedure, called the recombinant virus assay, allows the generation of viable virus by homologous recombination of a PCR-derived pool of RT coding sequences into an RT-deleted, noninfectious proviral clone, pHIV delta BstEII. A nested PCR procedure has been optimized to allow the amplification of an RT pool from both uncultured and cocultured infected patient peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) DNA for subsequent use in the creation of recombinant viruses. Analysis of two patients during the course of zidovudine therapy showed that this approach produced viruses which accurately exhibited the same genotype and phenotype as that of the original infected PBL DNA. The recombinant virus assay can be performed in approximately 3 weeks without the use of donor PBLs and therefore represents a rapid, nonselective procedure for the assay of clinical isolates."

While allogeneic grafts have thus far suggested complete eradication of viral reservoirs, it has yet to be observed following autologous HSC transplantation. Development of curative autologous transplantation strategies would significantly increase the number of treatable patients, eliminating the need for matched donors and reducing the risks of adverse events. Recent studies suggest gene therapy may provide a mechanism for developing curative therapies. Expression of cellular/artificial restriction factors or disruption of CCR5 has been shown to limit viral replication and provide protection of genetically modified cells. However, significant obstacles remain with regards to the depletion of established viral reservoirs in an autologous transplantation setting devoid of the ""allo-effect"". Here, we discuss results from early-stage clinical trials and recent findings in animal models of gene modified HSC transplantation. Finally, we propose innovative combination therapies that may aid in the reduction and/or elimination of viral reservoirs in HIV-1-infected patients and promote the artificial development of a natural controller phenotype.

HIV-specific humoral and T cell-mediated responses have been identified routinely in HESN subjects, although it remains unknown if these responses are a definitive cause of protection or merely a marker for exposure. Approximately half of HESN lack any detectible HIV-specific adaptive immune responses, suggesting that other mechanisms of protection from HIV-1 infection also probably exist. In support of the innate immune response as a mechanism of resistance, increased natural killer (NK) cell activity has been correlated with protection from infection in several high-risk cohorts of HESN subjects, including intravenous drug users, HIV-1 discordant couples and perinatally exposed infants. Inheritance of protective NK KIR3DL1(high) and KIR3DS1 receptor alleles have also been observed to be over-represented in a high-risk cohort of HESN intravenous drug users and HESN partners of HIV-1-infected subjects. Other intrinsic mechanisms of innate immune protection correlated with resistance in HESN subjects include heightened dendritic cell responses and increased secretion of anti-viral factors such as β-chemokines, small anti-viral factors and defensins. This review will highlight the most current evidence in HESN subjects supporting the role of epithelial microenvironment and the innate immune system in sustaining resistance against HIV-1 infection. We will argue that as a front-line defence the innate immune response determines the threshold of infectivity that HIV-1 must overcome to establish a productive infection."

Skin biopsy demonstrated a CD4+, CD25+, CD8- lymphocytic proliferation with a clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement. Peripheral blood demonstrated lymphocytosis with a CD4:CD8 ratio greater than 20:1 and an identical T-cell receptor (TCR) clone as that in the biopsy.

This may present as myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy or isolated left or right ventricular dysfunction. Myocardial involvement in HIV infection is multifactorial and may arise as a result of myocardial invasion with HIV itself, opportunistic infections, viral infections, autoimmune response to viral infection, drug-related cardiac toxicity, nutritional deficiencies, and prolonged immunosuppression. Both adults and children are affected with severity ranging from incidental microscopic inflammatory findings at autopsy to clinically significant cardiac disease with chronic cardiac dysfunction. It is associated with a poor prognosis, and results in symptomatic heart failure in up to 5% of HIV patients. Clinical pathological studies from the pre-HAART era show a 30% prevalence of cardiomyopathy in patients with AIDS. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens has substantially modified the course of HIV disease by lengthening survival and improving quality of life of HIV-infected patients. There is also good evidence that HAART significantly reduces the incidence of cardiovascular manifestations of HIV infection. By preventing opportunistic infections and reducing the incidence of myocarditis, HAART regimens have reduced the prevalence of HIV-associated cardiomyopathy by almost 7-fold from the pre-HAART era. HAART is however only available to a minority of HIV infected individuals in most areas of the world and studies from the pre-HAART period still apply. In this review, the aetiopathogenesis and presentation of HIV related myocardial disease were reviewed and measures taken to improve survival discussed."

It has been extensively used worldwide and is now the most prescribed antiretroviral (ARV) drug. Its high antiviral activity and favorable metabolic profile are responsible for its success. Furthermore, TDF has been associated with other ARVs to form new combined antiretroviral treatments in only one tablet once-a-day, which increases treatment adherence. Fears of potential nephrotoxicity that tenofovir would have in common with two other drugs from the same family (adefovir, used to treat hepatitis B, and cidofovir, used to treat cytomegalovirus infections) were alleviated by the early clinical trials. Yet, in 2001, the first case of TDF-induced acute nephrotoxicity was published. Numerous cases have been published since then, and it is now established that TDF presents a tubular toxicity risk. Some facilitating factors have been identified, such as co-prescription of didanosine or boosted protease inhibitor, preexisting CKD, low body weight, and associated diabetes mellitus. Conversely, whether TDF is nephrotoxic in the long term is a highly debated question. Some studies suggest a decreased GFR when TDF is prescribed for a long period, while others indicate that TDF is safe for the kidneys even after many years of use. Here we review the differences in patient characteristics, study designs, and measured outcomes that can possibly explain these conflicting findings. We conclude with rational recommendation for appropriate TDF prescription. "

Syphilis resurgence is observed mainly in men who have sex with men (MSM), yet other transmission groups are affected too. In this manuscript, we study the factors associated with syphilis incidence in the Swiss HIV cohort study in the era of highly effective antiretrovirals. Using parametric interval censored models with fixed and time-varying covariates, we studied the immunological, behavioral, and treatment-related elements associated with syphilis incidence in 3 transmission groups: MSM, heterosexuals, and intravenous drug users. Syphilis incidence has been increasing annually since 2005, with up to 74 incident cases per 1000 person-years in 2013, with MSM being the population with the highest burden (92% of cases). While antiretroviral treatment (ART) in general did not affect syphilis incidence, nevirapine (NVP) was associated with a lower hazard of syphilis incidence (multivariable hazard ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.2-1.0). We observed that condomless sex and younger age were associated with higher syphilis incidence. Moreover, time-updated CD4, nadir CD4, and CD8 cell counts were not associated with syphilis incidence. Finally, testing frequency higher than the recommended once a year routine testing was associated with a 2-fold higher risk of acquiring syphilis. Condomless sex is the main driver of syphilis resurgence in the Swiss HIV Cohort study; ART and immune reconstitution provide no protection against syphilis. This entails targeted interventions and frequent screening of high-risk populations. There is no known effect of NVP on syphilis; therefore, further clinical, epidemiological, and microbiological investigation is necessary to validate our observation."

Major cofactors that possibly increase the efficiency of heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 include genital ulcer disease, multiple sexual exposures, lack of male circumcision, and primary and advanced stages of HIV-1 disease. I report the case of a 33-year-old woman who was recently infected with HIV-1 after one to three nontraumatic episodes of vaginal intercourse with a healthy-appearing, HIV-1-infected, bisexual man. An investigation of her exposure history revealed the precise time frame during which infection occurred. The patient developed a primary HIV-1-infection syndrome and became seropositive for HIV-1 within eight weeks of her last sexual contact with the infected man. An epidemiological and laboratory evaluation of the index patient and her sexual partner identified only one risk factor for enhanced HIV-1 transmission: the patient's use of oral contraceptives. Her partner was immunologically intact, HIV-1 antigen negative, and circumcised. Both of the individuals were from Minnesota, as were their recent sexual partners. This case illustrates that HIV-1 infection by vaginal intercourse can occur in the absence of the major risk factors believed to increase the efficiency of transmission. Even in a low HIV-1 prevalence area like Minnesota, efforts to promote awareness of HIV-1 status, abstinence, non-penetrative sex, or barrier protection need to be expanded and the behaviors adopted by sexually active persons if HIV-1 transmission is to be minimized."

Thus, 379 pregnant women attending ante-natal consultation in Saint Camille Medical Centre were subject to HIV, HHV-8 antibodies and the viral marker Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) detection. We observed 48/379 (12.66%) HIV seropositive subjects. Among them, HIV-1 type infection was predominant (95.83%), only 2/48 (4.17%) subjects had a dual HIV-1 type and HIV-2 type infection, no single HIV-2 type infection was detected. 38/379 (10.02%) subjects were infected by HHV-8 and 30/379 (7.91%) were HBsAg positive. HHV-8 and HIV Co-infections rates were high within HBV positive patients and we had respectively 20.00 and 16.67%. 10.42% HIV positive women were coinfected by HBV while 12.50% were infected by HHV-8. Then, 15.79% subjects HHV-8 positive were co-infected by HBV or HIV. In spite of the PMTCT protocol application, five (10.42%) HIV positive women transmitted the virus to their children. Two HIV positive mothers were co-infected by HHV-8 and one by HBV. Among the 5 HIV infected, one mother (20.0%) was HBV positive and two (40.0%) HHV-8 positive. Although we did not have a large sample which would show large prélalences of the infections, we could put forward that the Co-infection of the HIV with one of these viruses (HBV or HHV-8) could favorite the mother-to-child transmission."

There is evidence to believe the main factor for this resurgence has been the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Co-infection with HIV and M. Tuberculosis has profound implications for the course of both diseases. This study represents a first attempt to understand how the introduction of an opportunistic infection, namely Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes TB, affects the dynamic interaction of HIV-1 and the immune system. We create a mathematical model using ordinary differential equations to describe the interaction of HIV and TB with the immune system. It is known that infection with TB can decrease the CD4(+) T cell counts-a key marker of AIDS progression; thus, it shortens survival in HIV infected individuals. Another main marker for HIV progression is the viral load. If this load is increased due to the presence of opportunistic infections, the disease progression is much more rapid. We also explore the effects of drug treatment on the TB infection in the doubly-infected patient."

Among 291 patients initially categorized as 'A' [asymptomatic, acute HIV, or persistent generalized lymphadenopathy-PGL] or 'B' [symptomatic, non-'A', or AIDS-indicator conditions] (CDC, 1992) and who progressed to AIDS, 57.0% died. Mortality rate was 34.9 person-months. Overall median survival time following AIDS diagnosis was 14.3 months. Multivariate analysis showed that lack of AZT use (RR=1.87; 95% CI=1.34-2.61), advanced initial staging (RR=1.68; 95% CI=1.20-2.35), 9 or more inpatient days (RR=1.55; 95% CI=1.11-2.17), and intervals between outpatient visits longer than 6 months (RR=0.30; 95%CI= 0.16-0.56) were associated with death.

The authors followed 296 IDU and 240 HM from February 1992 through September 1995 for: (i) death, (ii) AIDS, and (iii) AIDS or bacterial infection. At baseline, viral load was quantified using microculture techniques to determine infectious units per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (IUPM). Data were analyzed using standard statistical methods for survival analysis. Of the 536 total participants, 106 died (20%), and 98 of the 481 AIDS-free participants developed AIDS (20%). The relative hazard of AIDS for a viral load of > or = 100 IUPM, relative to a negative culture (0 IUPM), was 6.73 (95% CI: 2.23-20.3) after adjusting for risk group, initial CD4+ count, and other covariates. The adjusted relative hazard of death for a viral load of > or = 100 IUPM vs. 0 IUPM was 2.57 (95% CI: 0.97 6.80). Viral load predicted time to death within the < 200 cells/ul CD4+ stratum.

15158,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy and isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) are both effective interventions to prevent HIV-associated tuberculosis, but work via different mechanisms. We propose that these two interventions might best be used as complementary strategies at different stages of HIV progression. At relatively high CD4-cell counts, IPT reduces tuberculosis risk by 64% (95% CI 39-78%) in patients with positive tuberculin skin tests, and is the key tuberculosis preventive intervention before patients are eligible for antiretroviral therapy. However, at low CD4-cell counts, reliable exclusion of active tuberculosis is difficult, fewer patients are eligible for IPT, and waning immune function might limit the durability of its effect. In such patients, antiretroviral therapy is the primary intervention needed, reducing tuberculosis incidence by 67% (95% CI 61-73%). However, tuberculosis risk during long-term antiretroviral therapy remains several times higher than background, especially in those with poor immune recovery. Patients might therefore derive additional benefit from combined use of IPT and antiretroviral therapy to simultaneously treat mycobacterial infection and restore tuberculosis-specific immune function. For those first presenting with advanced immunodeficiency, we propose that concurrent IPT might best be delayed until completion of the first few months of antiretroviral therapy, when active tuberculosis can be more reliably excluded. Data from randomised controlled trials are needed to underpin further development of public-health policy."

In the group switched to the very high purity concentrate there was no significant change of the CD4 cell counts over the 96-week follow-up period, whereas in the group continued on the intermediate purity concentrate, a highly significant decline was detected (P less than .013).

In the current study, we investigated the changes in the CD4(+) T cell subsets and their association with immune reconstitution and immune activation at early stages of ART. A prospective study was performed in 21 asymptomatic treatment-naive HIV-infected patients with CD4(+) T cells less than 350 cells/μl. Blood samples were evaluated at base line, and at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks' post antiretroviral therapy (ART). A biphasic increase of CD4(+) T cells, central memory CD4 cells (CD4 CM) and CD4 naïve cells were observed after ART, with a rapid increase before week 4. Change in CD4 CM at week 4 positively correlated with the change in CD4(+) T cells at weeks 12 post ART, and negatively correlated with the change in CD8(+)CD38(+) T cells at weeks 12 post ART. We conclude that CD4 CM cells are a major contributor to early immune reconstitution in treatment-naive HIV-infected patients with delayed ART, and might be an early indicator for immune reconstitution."

Until now reviews have focused on the problem of the HBeAg-positive HCWs. After transmission of HBV by HBeAg-negative surgeons, the focus of Public Health Policy in the UK and the Netherlands has changed from HBeAg status to serum HBV DNA level. Viral load and the volume of blood transmitted determine the transmission risk of HBV. We have estimated the number of infectious particles transmitted by needlesticks, in comparison with those attributed in maternal-fetal transfusion. The blood volume transmitted by needlestick is roughly 1-30% of that of delivery. As vertical transmission with maternal HBV DNA levels below 10(7) g Eq./ml is rarely documented, HBV transmission by needlesticks is, according to our assumptions, unlikely to occur with HBV DNA levels below 10(7) g Eq./ml. Sera of transmitting HCWs contained HBV DNA levels between 5.0 x 10(9) and 6.35 x 10(4) g Eq./ml. Interpretation of these levels is hampered as the sera were taken at least 3 months after transmission. To prevent both loss of expertise and nosocomial infection, highly viremic HCWs can be offered antiviral therapy. Lamivudine and alpha-interferon can now be complemented with adefovir, tenofovir and entecavir to provide effective new therapies for chronic HBV-infected HCWs."

On the other hand, some systemic diseases can modify salivary protein concentrations, which may change their importance or role as specific biomarkers. To study the relationship between periodontal disease and concentrations of human beta-defensin 2 (HBD-2) in the saliva of patients infected and not infected with HIV. To evaluate the association between HBD-2 salivary concentration and viral load, the TCD4+ lymphocyte count (LTCD-4+) and the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) was assessed in HIV infected patients. Concentrations of HBD-2 were measured in 48 patients not infected with HIV and 53 HIV-infected patients by ELISA, and these data were compared according to periodontal status. Within the group of HIV-infected patients, measures of HBD-2 were assessed according to viral load, LTCD-4+ count and the use of ART. Concentrations of salivary HBD-2 were associated with periodontal disease in non-HIV-infected patients. In HIV-infected patients, salivary HBD-2 was associated with serum status and the use of ART, but it was not related to the periodontal condition. The presence of HBD-2 in the saliva of HIV-infected patients showed no correlations with LTCD-4+ count or viral load. HBD-2 could be a periodontal biomarker in non-HIV-infected patients, but in HIV-infected patients, while salivary HBD- 2 was influenced by the serum status and ART use, it was not correlated with the periodontal condition."

Previous investigations have associated HBV disease with specific mutations but this association may be confounded by HBV genotype, HLA haplotype of the infected individual or both. The association between non-synonymous mutations located within putative cytotoxic T-lymphocyte directed epitopes (CDE) of the HBV core region and disease states was investigated. Subjects infected with HBV were enrolled from a clinical cohort in Seoul, Korea, and HBV core gene sequences were analyzed for mutational patterns inside and outside of CDE with respect to subject demographics and HBV-related disease states. No specific mutation or pattern of mutations were associated with progressive disease states; however, individuals with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma had greater numbers of non-synonymous mutations within CDE when compared to those with chronic HBV infection who were HBeAg positive (P = 0.007 and 0.026, respectively). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that HBV disease progression is associated with viral escape mutations that are a marker of CTL activity. These data suggest that the number of non-synonymous mutations in the HBV core region may predict HBV disease progression better than any single mutation or pattern of mutations."

A comparison was also made with 526 normal controls (266 males and 260 females). Forty-seven (75%) CAPD patients were anti-HBc positive, with no significant difference to the control group (81.9%). This probably reflects acquisition of HBV infection by CAPD patients before initiation of chronic dialysis therapy in a region hyperendemic for HBV. On the contrary, 11 (17.2%) CAPD patients were anti-HCV positive and 8 (15.2%) were seropositive for both anti-HBc and anti-HCV-much greater prevalence rates compared to those of the control group. The prevalence of anti-HCV correlated with the history and numbers of blood transfusion, and the length of time on previous hemodialysis. A similar correlation occurred in patients with both anti-HBc(+) and anti-HCV(+). In conclusion, in an HBV endemic area such as Taiwan, the prevalence of coexisting HBV and HCV infection in CAPD patients depends on the latter."

The natural history of HBV and HCV in the dialysis population remains unclear; however, there is good evidence showing an adverse impact of an anti-HCV seropositive status on survival in dialysis patients. A recent meta-analysis of observational studies (n=7, 11,589 unique patients) reported that anti-HCV-positive patients on dialysis had a higher mortality rate than those who were anti-HCV negative (adjusted hazard ratio=1.35, 95% confidence interval, 1.13; 1.59, p<0.001). This was in part attributed to a higher frequency of chronic hepatitis C and its attending complications (cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). In addition, HCV appeared to have a negative influence on quality of life. Recent clinical guidelines by the KDIGO Study Group have not suggested the isolation of anti-HCV-positive patients on maintenance dialysis. Standard precautions and specific procedures against the transmission of blood-borne agents have been recommended to control HCV infection within dialysis units. Isolation by dialysis machines, staff and rooms has been strongly recommended to control HBV. Vaccination is an important tool against transmission of HBV infection among patients on maintenance dialysis; however, the immune response towards the hepatitis B vaccine in uremic patients remains unsatisfactory. Monotherapy with lamivudine is currently used for dialysis patients with hepatitis B whereas combination antiviral therapy (pegylated interferon plus ribavirin) is the standard of care for hepatitis C in the dialysis population, even if various side effects have been observed."

Thirty-eight patients were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive. Two patients were anti-delta-positive. A total of 79 patients (65.8%) had at least one serum positive for anti-HCV. Anti-HCV positivity decreased after transplantation for more than 5 years (65.5% at transplantation versus 37.9%, 78.3 +/- 13.4 months later). Among those with positive anti-HCV, the HBsAg-positive group had significantly higher incidence of chronic hepatitis (50% vs. 25.5%, P = 0.026) and liver cirrhosis (21.4% vs. 0%, P = 0.001) than HBsAg-negative group. Among the 82 HBsAg-negative patients, the prevalence of anti-HCV was significantly higher in those with chronic hepatitis than in those without (86.7% vs. 56.7%, P = 0.027). We conclude from this study: (1) anti-HCV positivity is quite prevalent in renal transplant patients; (2) coinfection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) may lead to aggressive liver disease and cirrhosis; HCV infection alone has a more benign clinical outcome; and (3) HCV infection is an important cause of posttransplant chronic hepatitis in HBsAg-negative patients."

Although sustained virologic response (SVR) is achievable with interferon and ribavirin in dialysis patients, SVR rates are lower, and the use of ribavirin is challenging because of the risk of hemolytic anemia. Recently, interferon-ribavirin free direct acting antivirals (DAAs) treatment has shown strong efficacy and fewer adverse events for chronic HCV infection patients without using dialysis, but there are few reports about DAAs for such patients. Thus, we conducted a study to examine the effect and safety of daclatasvir and asunaprevir in chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1b-infected hemodialysis patients. We treated 10 patients: seven males and three females. Before treatment, we detected resistance-associated variants on the NS5A region, which is the L31M site variant, in two patients. Although two patients showed resistance-associated variant, all the patients showed quick disappearance of HCV RNA in the serum and achieved a SVR12. During this therapy, no patients displayed abnormal liver function during treatment. Two patients experienced diarrhea and another one patient complained of nausea soon after treatment but these were relieved by symptomatic therapy. We report good results of treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1b -infected patients on hemodialysis with all oral DAAs (daclatasvir and asunaprevir)."

Questionnaires were distributed to evaluate the risk factors for HDV infection and also to estimate the strength of association among HDV infection and the risk factors. HBV infection was common, and the positive rates of HBV markers between intravenous drug abusers and non-drug abusers were not statistically different. However, the positive rate of the antibody to HDV was significantly higher among intravenous drug abusers than among non-drug abusers (21.3% vs. 8.6%). Of 131 chronic HBV carriers with intravenous drug abuse, 119 (91%) were anti-HD positive. Using multiple logistic regression models, we found that the most important risk factor for HDV infection was hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriage, and intravenous drug addiction the next. A matched case-control study also was conducted to compare liver function tests among both anti-HD- and HBsAg-positive group anti-HD-negative, and HBs-AG-positive group as well as those with neither positive. Statistically significant difference in liver function tests was not found. It is concluded that the HBsAg carriers with intravenous drug abuse in Taiwan are commonly HDV infected with and that the infection does not seem to affect the liver as assessed by liver function tests."

The frequent association of anti-LKM-1 antibodies and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and the probable existence of an infectious and autoimmune form of anti-LKM-1-associated hepatitis, requiring different therapeutical strategies, necessitates the exact determination of anti-LKM-1 specificities. Therefore, we compared various antibody tests (immunofluorescence, ELISA with recombinant P450 2D6, and Western blot with recombinant and natural antigens and agargel double diffusion) with sera of 27 anti-LKM-1-positive chronic active hepatitis (CAH) patients, with 61 sera harbouring anti-mitochondrial antibodies, 100 sera each from HCV-RNA-positive and HCV-RNA-negative patients, and 50 sera of healthy persons. Western blot techniques using recombinant MS2-polymerase P450 2D6 fusion protein were found to be the most sensitive and specific method for anti-LKM-1 antibody determination in routine laboratory. The recently recognized association of anti-LKM-1 antibody and HCV infection was confirmed by the results of this study. In anti-HCV and HCV-RNA-positive patients with anti-LKM-1 antibodies there was a preponderance of males with higher mean age and lower antibody titres. The results support the hypothesis of the existence of an autoimmune as well as an infectious (HCV triggered) subgroup of anti-LKM-1-positive hepatitis."

Preliminary serological studies carried out earlier among the four accessible tribes revealed that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is hyper-endemic among them. The present study was carried out to understand important modes of transmission and to identify possible risk factors associated with HBV infection among the Nicobarese tribe. The epidemiology of HBV infection in these islands appears to be distinct with a high prevalence of the chronic carrier state (22.2%) associated with a comparable proportion of the population being anti-HBs positive (26.3%). More than half of the HBsAg and anti-HBs negative individuals have anti-HBc antibodies. Age, past history of hospital admission, intramuscular injections and number of carriers in the tuhet were found to be significantly associated with exposure to hepatitis B virus. Horizontal transmission through close contact with carriers and perinatal route appears to be an important mode of transmission of HBV in this community. Besides this, use of unsafe injections represents an independent risk factor for acquiring HBV infection in this population. Introducing HBV vaccine in the infant immunization programme and improving injection safety would help to control the infection in the tribal community of these islands."

The longer term impact of exposure to HIV and antiretroviral therapy throughout childhood are becoming apparent, with growing concern over neurocognitive, cardiovascular, renal and bone health.

Myopathies may be caused by pyogenic infection (eg, pyomyositis), idiopathic inflammation (eg, polymyositis), or drug effect (eg, AZT myopathy). Characteristic skeletal infections, such as tuberculosis and bacillary angiomatosis, require a high index of suspicion for accurate diagnosis. Neoplastic processes, such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma, occur more frequently as the immune system deteriorates. Inflammatory and reactive arthropathies are more prevalent in HIV-positive than HIV-negative individuals and include Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, HIV-associated arthritis, painful articular syndrome, acute symmetric polyarthritis, and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.

In chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, immune activation and inflammation result in collagen deposition and disruption of this LT niche. We have previously shown that these fibrotic changes correlate with a reduction in the size of the total population of CD4+ T cells. We now show that this reduction is most substantial within the naïve CD4+ T-cell population and is in proportion to the extent of LT collagen deposition in HIV-1 infection. Thus, the previously documented depletion of naïve CD4+ T cells in LTs in HIV-1 infection may be a consequence not only of a decreased supply of thymic emigrants or chronic immune activation but also of the decreased ability of those cells to survive in a scarred LT niche. We speculate that LT collagen deposition might therefore limit repopulation of naïve CD4+ T cells with highly active antiretroviral therapy, and thus, additional treatments directed to limiting or reversing inflammatory damage to the LT niche could potentially improve immune reconstitution."

Yet, the contribution of intramural HIV transmission to the epidemic is scarcely known, especially in low- and middle-income settings. In this study, we surveyed 1,667 inmates incarcerated at Presídio Central de Porto Alegre, located in southern Brazil, for HIV infection and molecular characterization. The HIV seroprevalence was 6.6% (110/1,667). Further analyses were carried out on 40 HIV-seropositive inmates to assess HIV transmission clusters and drug resistance within the facility with the use of molecular and phylogenetic techniques. The molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 subtypes observed was similar to the one reported for the general population in southern Brazil, with the predominance of HIV-1 subtypes C, B, CRF31_BC and unique BC recombinants. In particular, the high rate (24%) of URF_BC found here may reflect multiple exposures of the population investigated to HIV infection. We failed to find HIV-infected inmates sharing transmission clusters with each other. Importantly, the analysis of HIV-1 pol genomic fragments evidenced high rates of HIV primary and secondary (acquired) drug resistance and an alarming proportion of virologic failure among patients under treatment, unveiling suboptimal access to antiretroviral therapy (ARV), low ARV adherence and dissemination of drug resistant HIV strains in primary infections. Our results call for immediate actions of public authority to implement preventive measures, serological screening and, for HIV-seropositive subjects, clinical and treatment follow-up in order to control HIV infection and limit the spread of drug resistance strains in Brazilian prisons.

Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is used as treatment for HCV infection. The therapeutic benefit is assumed to result from activation of natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells. Despite its beneficial effects, it has been associated with a number of autoimmune disorders, such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and multiple sclerosis. Several clinical reports including magnetic resonance imaging exist, but neuropathological confirmation of MS associated with IFN-alpha therapy and HCV infection is lacking. We report a case of a female patient with chronic HCV infection who developed ;acute MS'-like demyelinating disease after IFN-alpha administration, with extensive lesions throughout brain and thoracic spinal cord. The patient died after a disease duration of 6 months. Brain autopsy revealed Baló-like demyelinating plaques with positive HCV sequences within florid lesions. The development of fulminant demyelinating disease after administration of IFN-alpha suggests that autoimmune mechanisms such as T cell mediated tissue damage might be initiated or aggravated by IFN-alpha therapy. Additionally, the presence of HCV RNA within the demyelinated lesion indicates a possible role in triggering or propagating disease."

B19 has a tropism for erythroid progenitors and causes pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). The failure to produce neutralizing antibodies to the virus following B19 infection in immunodeficient persons may result in persistent viremia and chronic PRCA (B19-PRCA). The seroprevalence rates for B19 in unselected persons with HIV infection are high, similar to those seen in the general population. Reports of B19-related anemia in HIV infected patients, however, are infrequent. A partial explanation may be that B19-PRCA is predominantly a complication associated with advanced immunodeficiency. The condition is probably underdiagnosed as well. The finding of an unexplained normocytic anemia with absent reticulocytes, in an afebrile HIV-infected patient without renal dysfunction suggests a diagnosis of B19-PRCA. The diagnosis is established when the following criteria are met: (1) bone marrow biopsy showing PRCA, (2) serum or bone marrow positivity for B19 DNA by PCR or dot-blot hybridization, and (C) no alternate explanation for the PRCA. Serological methods are unreliable for the diagnosis because these patients often lack IgM and IgG antibodies to B19. Nearly all patients with B19-PRCA respond to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) with a rise in the hemoglobin to levels appropriate for the clinical condition of the patient. An alternative explanation for the anemia must be sought in patients not responding to IVIg. Most patients with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts of < or = 100 cells/mm3 relapse to anemia, usually within 6 months of IVIg therapy. Such patients must be retreated with IVIg 2 g/kg given over 2 to 5 days. The routine use of maintenance IVIg 0.4 g/kg q 4wk may be considered in these patients to prevent relapse."

Ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) was utilized to determine HBV genetic variability within the RT region at baseline and during a 48-week ADV therapy. According to the viral load at the end of ADV treatment, all patients were classified into responders (HBV DNA level reduction of ⩾ 3 log 10 IU/mL) and suboptimal responders (HBV DNA level reduction of <3 log 10 IU/mL). Based on UDPS data at baseline, we identified 11 nucleotide substitutions whose combination frequency was significantly associated with the antiviral response among 36 CHB patients in the study group. However, the baseline distribution and frequency of rt181 and rt236 substitutions known to confer ADV resistance was a poor predictor for the antiviral response. Compared with baseline serum HBeAg, HBV-DNA and ALT levels, the baseline HBV sequence-based model showed higher predictive accuracy for ADV response. In an independent cohort of 31 validation patients with CHB, the sequence-based model provided greater predictive potency than the HBeAg/HBV-DNA/ALT and the HBeAg/HBV-DNA/ALT/sequence combinations. Taken together, we confirm the presence of ADV resistance variants in treatment-naïve patients and firstly unravel the predictive value of the baseline mutations in the HBV RT region for ADV antiviral response."

Genetically compartmentalized virus in the CNS is associated with HAD, suggesting autonomous viral replication as a factor in the disease process. We examined the source of compartmentalized HIV-1 in the CNS of subjects with HIV-1-associated neurological disease and in asymptomatic subjects who were initiating antiretroviral therapy. The heteroduplex tracking assay (HTA), targeting the variable regions of env, was used to determine which HIV-1 genetic variants in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were compartmentalized and which variants were shared with the blood plasma. We then measured the viral decay kinetics of individual variants after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Compartmentalized HIV-1 variants in the CSF of asymptomatic subjects decayed rapidly after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, with a mean half-life of 1.57 days. Rapid viral decay was also measured for CSF-compartmentalized variants in four HAD subjects (t(1/2) mean = 2.27 days). However, slow viral decay was measured for CSF-compartmentalized variants from an additional four subjects with neurological disease (t(1/2) range = 9.85 days to no initial decay). The slow decay detected for CSF-compartmentalized variants was not associated with poor CNS drug penetration, drug resistant virus in the CSF, or the presence of X4 virus genotypes. We found that the slow decay measured for CSF-compartmentalized variants in subjects with neurological disease was correlated with low peripheral CD4 cell count and reduced CSF pleocytosis. We propose a model in which infiltrating macrophages replace CD4(+) T cells as the primary source of productive viral replication in the CNS to maintain high viral loads in the CSF in a substantial subset of subjects with HAD."

The affinity constants of antibody for p24 and p17 were determined by a double isotope fluid-phase radioimmunoassay; and the relationships between antibody affinity and titre, patient clinical course, CD4 cell counts and p24 antigenaemia were analysed. The affinity of p24- and p17-specific antibody was up to 100 times greater in asymptomatic patients than in patients who progressed to AIDS. Patients who developed AIDS either lost or failed to develop high-affinity antibodies early in the infection. Asymptomatic patients maintained high-affinity antibodies for several years; however, in some of these patients the affinity of anti-p24 and p17 antibodies subsequently fell later in the study period. The presence of low-affinity antibody and progressive reduction in the titre of specific antibody were earlier predictors of disease onset than CD4 cell counts. The failure to either develop or maintain high affinity gag-specific antibody suggests an early impairment of T helper function in individuals who progressed to AIDS.

Analysis of 17 posttreatment samples identified 105 genes that correctly classified all 9 patients with response at the end of treatment and 7 of 8 patients with sustained virological response (94% overall). Failure of anti-HCV therapy was associated with elevated expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Gene expression patterns may provide a tool to predict anti-HCV therapeutic response."

In the era of highly effective antiretroviral therapy, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease has emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Accordingly, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease guidelines for the management of HCV recommend that patients with HIV/HCV undergo medical evaluation for HCV-related liver disease and consideration for HCV treatment and, if indicated, orthotopic liver transplantation. However, the treatment of patients with HIV/HCV is complicated by the relatively high prevalence of medical and psychiatric comorbidities and the challenges of anti-HCV therapy in the setting of HIV disease and antiretroviral therapy. Nonetheless, recently completed randomized controlled trials provide evidence of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of HCV treatment with pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin in HIV-infected individuals. This review focuses on the epidemiology, natural history, and management of HCV in the HIV-infected patient."

Immune response to HAV vaccine has not been well studied in HIV+ patients. In particular, there is little information in the literature regarding the effect and relationship of the CD4 count and the immune response in HIV patients. A retrospective analysis of HIV+ patients who received HAV vaccine was performed, and the antibody response to HAV (anti-HAV) measured. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine predictors of response to vaccine administration. Of the 503 patients evaluated, 138 patients completed their HAV vaccination series and 48% of them had postvaccine anti-HAV positive results (responders). There was no difference in age, race, antiretroviral therapy use, or hepatitis C virus exposure between responders and nonresponders. In univariate analysis, responders were more likely to be female (40.3%vs 21.1%, P = 0.01), have a higher CD4 count at vaccine (508.6 cells/mm3 vs 344.3 cells/mm3, P = 0.001) and marginally lower viral load at vaccine (2.65 log copies vs 2.94 log copies, P = 0.07). Multivariate analysis showed that female gender and higher CD4 count at vaccine were independent predictors of response to vaccine. Forty-eight per cent of our HIV+ patients responded to HAV vaccine administration. This is much lower than reported rates of 100% in HIV-negative patients. Female gender and CD4 count at vaccine, but not CD4 nadir, predicted response to vaccine."

Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an efficacious HIV prevention intervention that uses antiretroviral drugs to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection. In Mozambique, HIV remains a major public health concern, with a national prevalence of 13%. Studies have demonstrated that the migration of male miners between southern provinces of Mozambique and South Africa is contributing to the HIV epidemic in Mozambique. This increased risk is associated with the engagement of male miners, while separated from their partners, in sexual relationships with other women, including transactional sex workers, in a hyperendemic setting in South Africa. We conducted 25 in-depth interviews with a subset of female partners in a stable relationship with migrant miners participating in a prospective cohort study to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to daily oral short-term PrEP. Drug levels were available for the participants, as reported in an earlier study. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and submitted for qualitative thematic analysis. The major themes identified were the benefits of taking PrEP, the ease of taking daily PrEP, the reluctance to disclose PrEP use to partners, the lack of changes in sexual behavior, and prevailing gender dynamics and how they impact women's ability to access PrEP and other HIV prevention interventions."

Proteinuria, but not creatinine clearance, was associated with higher percentages of CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+ cells (55% vs. 50%; P=.01), with even more pronounced differences noted among men and among blacks and Hispanics.

HIV/AIDS patients face countless challenges, one of which is the risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). This study aimed to describe the ADRs reported in South Africa with reference to the type of ADRs, antiretrovirals (ARVs) implicated, seriousness of the ADRs and patient demographics associated with specific ADRs. A retrospective quantitative study was carried out using ADR reports submitted to the National Department of Health (NDoH) from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2014. A descriptive and inferential analysis was carried out to determine the strength of the relationships between different variables. A total of 2 489 reports were analysed. This study found evidence of ADRs among patients on regimens based on stavudine (n = 1 256, 50.46%), efavirenz (n = 572, 22.98%), zidovudine (n = 209, 8.40%), tenofovir (n = 203, 8.16%) and nevirapine (n = 153, 6.15%). The 10 most common ADRs reported with the use of ARVs were peripheral neuropathy (n = 472, 19%), lipodystrophy (n = 471, 18.9%), serious skin reactions (n = 266, 10.7%), gynaecomastia (n = 219, 8.8%), renal failure (n = 140, 5.6%), dizziness (n = 133, 5.3%), hyperlactatemia (n = 118, 4.7%), psychosis/hallucinations (n = 47, 1.9%), sleep disturbances (n = 44, 1.8%) and vomiting (n = 44, 1.8%). Female patients were more likely to experience peripheral neuropathy, lipodystrophy, skin rash, anaemia and hyperlactatemia, while male patients were more prone to experience gynaecomastia and peripheral neuropathy. In addition, patients aged 30-44 years reported the most ADRs. Most reactions resulted from the use of stavudine, efavirenz, zidovudine, nevirapine and tenofovir in the population groups identified in this study. "

However, the recent identification of several cases of HIV-1 reinfection suggests that the specific immune response generated for chronic HIV-1 infection may not be adequate to protect against infection by a second HIV-1 strain. It has been unclear, though, whether these individuals are representative of the global epidemic or are rare cases. Here we show that in a population of high-risk women, HIV-1 reinfection occurs almost as commonly as first infections. The study was designed to detect cases of reinfection by HIV-1 of a different subtype and thus captured cases where there was considerable diversity between the first and second strain. In each case, the second virus emerged approximately 1 year after the first infection, and in two cases, it emerged when viral levels were high, suggesting that a well-established HIV-1 infection may provide little benefit in terms of immunizing against reinfection, at least by more-divergent HIV-1 variants. Our findings indicate an urgent need for studies of larger cohorts to determine the incidence and timing of both intersubtype and intrasubtype reinfection."

Both HIV infection and HAART can cause changes in lipid and glucose metabolism as well as elevation of blood pressure, promoting the development of atherosclerosis. Cardiovascular diseases have become a major cause of mortality among HIV-infected subjects who respond well to antiretroviral therapy.

However, insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance will develop during PI treatment in a considerable proportion of patients. Dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, and loss of peripheral fat frequently coexist with insulin resistance, but it is not clear whether all of these result from a common pathogenic mechanism. Recent data suggest that insulin resistance may also be associated with HIV infection in patients not receiving PI therapy. The long-term consequences of insulin resistance in this population are not known. The effect of switching to other antiretroviral therapies has not been fully determined. Treatment of established diabetes mellitus should generally follow existing guidelines. There is no clinically useful screening test that will determine the existence and degree of insulin resistance in individual patients. It is therefore reasonable to recommend general measures to increase insulin sensitivity in all patients infected with HIV, such as weight reduction for obese persons and regular aerobic exercise."

In contrast, the effect of HBV on the outcome of patients infected with HIV-1 is controversial. Some cohort studies from the pre-HAART era described a more rapid progression to AIDS in patients carrying antibodies to the core-antigen or having chronic HBV infection, but post-HAART studies did not detect any impact of HBV co-infection on HIV-disease progression. Similarly, studies assessing the impact of HCV on progression of HIV-disease delivered conflicting results. In the Swiss cohort study, the presence of HCV was independently associated with an increased risk of progression to AIDS and death. Subsequent studies, however, did not find any difference in survival. Most interestingly, the EuroSIDA cohort analysis found no difference between HCV-positive and HCV-negative HIV-patients starting HAART in the time needed to decrease viral loads to less than 400 copies as well as in the time needed to increase CD4-counts by 50%. In summary, there are no major differences in HIV-related mortality between hepatitis B or C co-infected individuals and patients infected with HIV alone, particularly if antiretroviral treatment is given. There is, however, an increased risk of liver disease related morbidity and mortality as well as more hepatoxicity under antiretroviral treatment regimens."

The incidence and risk factors associated with hepatotoxicity in this population after high active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is initiated are still not well-understood. We argued to evaluate the incidence and risk factors associated with liver enzyme elevation (LEE) and their clinical significance. A retrospective chart review of patients who started HAART and had follow up at our centre for at least 1 year was undertaken. The frequency and severity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation after treatment initiation were investigated and searched for clinical manifestations. Between January 1996 and March 2002, 85 HIV-HCV co-infected patients began HAART and continued follow up for at least 1 year. The incidence of severe toxicity [grades 3 + 4 LEE: >5 and >10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) of ALT or AST] was calculated at 4% per person-years. There were no clinical manifestations of liver toxicity, and patients continued their treatment with a trend towards a decrease of their enzymes. No statistical differences in opportunistic infections or mortality were evident. The variables associated with severe hepatotoxicity were a higher baseline AST, higher international normalized ratio (INR) and lower albumin. A baseline AST < 2.1 ULN had a negative predictive value of 92% of leading to severe hepatotoxicity. In HIV-HCV co-infected patients therefore, the group at a higher risk of developing higher transaminase elevations is the one with a higher baseline AST, higher INR and lower albumin."

Depression has been also reported as one of the main causes of poor adherence with antiretroviral regimens. However, no published investigation has specifically focused on the relationship between depression and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Nonetheless, information on the association between depressive symptoms and adherence may be gathered from investigations carried out to explore determinants of adherence with antiretroviral therapy. Findings from available studies show a substantial and consistent relationship between adherence to antiretroviral regimens and depression. Early recognition and proper management of depressive comorbidity could be an effective intervention strategy to improve adherence and may make a difference in the quality of life, social functioning, and disease course of people with HIV."

During a median follow-up of 504 days, CD4 counts increased by a median of 62 cells per year. By univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis, the level of p24 antigen as expressed by the absorbance/cutoff ratio was a significant inverse correlate of both the CD4 count in a sample (p =.013) and its annual change in a patient (p <.0001). The p24 antigen retained significance even among 48 individuals whose HIV-1 RNA, apart from occasional blips, remained below 400 copies/mL. Batch-wise retesting of 70 samples from 5 such patients with a further improved procedure showed measurable p24 antigen in all but 1 sample and an inverse correlation with both the CD4 count (p =.0331) and percentage (p <.0001), thus confirming the prospectively generated data. Comparison of p24 antigen and HIV-1 RNA concentrations indicate that the p24 antigen detected in these samples is not associated with viral RNA-containing particles and may originate from other compartments of virus expression."

Both HCV genotype and viral load have been suggested to be important prognostic markers of disease progression and treatment outcome. In addition, co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been associated with increased level of HCV replication and higher risk of developing liver failure. Thus, HCV genotype, viral load, and HIV co-infection are important factors in HCV infection. Using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP) and the branched-DNA (bDNA) assay, we retrospectively investigated the HCV genotypes and viral loads present in 59 Argentinean hemophiliacs, in the presence or absence of HIV infection. HCV genotype 1 was the predominant viral variant detected among HIV-negative (HIV-) (76%) and HIV-positive (HIV+) (82.5%) patients, followed by genotypes 3 (10.4%), 2 (2%) and a small proportion of multiply co-infected patients including genotypes 4 and 5 (6.25%). HIV+ patients had higher plasma HCV RNA levels than HIV- patients (88.4 +/- 16.5 x 10(5) Eq/ml vs. 24.7 +/- 10(5) Eq/ml) (P < 0.001); however, no correlation between HCV replication and level of immune suppression, evaluated by CD4+ T-cell measurement, was observed among HIV+ patients (r = 0.017). Abnormal and higher ALT levels were more frequently detected among HIV+ (93%; 123.6 +/- 15.7 U/liter) than HIV- (41%; 70.2 +/- 24.2 U/liter) patients (P < 0.001; P < 0.05). Although we were able to confirm previous reports suggesting the existence of increased HCV replication in HIV/HCV co-infected hemophiliacs, our data did not support the conclusion that HIV-induced immune suppression is directly responsible for this phenomena. It is possible that other factors induced by HIV are responsible for the increased levels in HCV replication observed."

Rhesus macaque 359, a vaccine control animal, resisted two successive intravaginal challenges with SIV(mac251) and failed to seroconvert. Here, after an additional intrarectal SIVmac32H challenge, macaque 359 remained highly resistant to infection. Viral RNA (10(6) copies/ml) was observed in plasma only at week 2 postchallenge. Virus isolation and proviral DNA were positive only once at week eight postchallenge. The animal remained seronegative and cleared SIV in vivo. Its blood and lymph node cells obtained at 49 weeks after intrarectal challenge did not transmit SIV to a naive macaque. We found that the resistance of macaque 359 to SIV infection was not due to a high level of CD8(+) suppressor activity but to an inherent resistance of its CD4(+) T cells. To elucidate the basis for the unusually strong resistance of macaque 359 to SIV infection in vivo and in vitro, we investigated early events of viral infection and replication in CD4(+) cells of macaque 359, including expression and mutation screening of SIV coreceptors and analysis of viral entry and reverse transcription. Mutation screening revealed no genetic alteration in SIV coreceptors. PCR analysis revealed a significant delay in production of early in vitro reverse transcription intermediates in macaque 359 cells compared to susceptible controls, but cell fusion assays showed that SIV entered the CD4(+) CCR5(+) cells of macaque 359 as readily as cells of macaques susceptible to SIV infection. Our results suggest that the resistance of macaque 359 to SIV infection is due to a postentry block in viral replication and implicate a cellular inhibitory mechanism in its CD4(+) T cells. Identification of this host mechanism will help further elucidate the biochemistry of reverse transcription and may suggest therapeutic strategies. Determining the prevalence of this host resistance mechanism among macaques may lead to better design of SIV pathogenesis and vaccine studies."

To address the correlation between HIV-1-specific CTL responses and virus replication in a cohort of former plasma donors (FPDs), 143 antiretroviral therapy naive FPDs infected with HIV-1 clade B' strains were assessed for HIV-1-specific CTL responses with an IFN-γ Elispot assay at single peptide level by using overlapping peptides (OLPs) covering the whole consensus clade B proteome. By using a Spearman's rank correlation analysis, we found that the proportion of Gag-specific CTL responses among the total virus-specific CTL activity was inversely correlated with viral loads while being positively correlated to CD4 counts, as opposed to Pol- and Env-specific responses that were associated with increased viral loads and decreased CD4 counts. In addition, Vpr-specifc CTL responses showed a similar protective effect with Gag responses, but with a much lower frequency of recognition. Significantly, we also observed an association between HLA-A*30/B*13/Cw*06 haplotype and lower viral loads that was probably due to restricted Gag-specific CTL responses. Thus, our data demonstrate the prominent role of Gag-specific CTL responses in disease control. The advantage of HLA-A*30/B*13/Cw*06 haplotype in viral control may be associated with the contribution of Gag-specific CTL responses in the studied individuals."

Viral replication was detected at different rates, with apparently increasing sensitivity: 1 of 10 by phylogenetic analysis; 2 of 10 by viral evolution with increasing genetic distances from the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of infection; 3 of 10 by selection of drug-resistant mutants; and 6 of 10 by maintenance of genetic distances from the MRCA. When four- or five-drug antiretroviral regimens were given to these children, persistent plasma viral rebound did not occur despite the accumulation of highly drug-resistant genotypes. Among the four children without genetic evidence of viral replication, a statistically significant decrease in the genetic distance to the MRCA was detected in three, indicating the persistence of a greater number of early compared to recent viruses, and their HIV-1 DNA decreased by > or =0.9 log(10), resulting in lower absolute DNA levels (P = 0.007). This study demonstrates the variable rates of viral replication when HAART has suppressed plasma HIV-1 RNA for years to a median of <50 copies/ml and that combinations of four or five antiretroviral drugs suppress viral replication even after short-term virologic failure of three-drug HAART and despite ongoing accumulation of drug-resistant mutants. Furthermore, the decrease of cellular HIV-1 DNA to low absolute levels in those without genetic evidence of viral replication suggests that monitoring viral DNA during HAART may gauge low-level replication."

In addition to injection drugs use, all of them were multiple drug abusers. In response to the sharing of needle, 35.7%(143) of the IDUs shared needle uncommonly and 64.3%(257) did not shared it at all. Ninety-three percent (372) of them were heterosexual and polygamous having extramarital sex with multiple partners. The quality of sex-partners was wife, friends, brothel & hotel based sex sellers and street sex sellers. Majority of IDUs {82.0%(328)} did not use condom at all and 15.5(62) sold blood several times in their lifetime. Seven percent {7.0%(28)} injection drug abusers had been suffering from hepatitis-B virus (HBV) infection. HBV infection was found to be significantly (p≥0.05) associated with the quality of sex partners and number of sex partners, and age and marital status. There is no significant association with sharing of needle particularly occasional sharing of needle. Altering the behaviors of IDUs, especially their sexual lifestyles, drug habit, using of disposable syringe without sharing of needle, and also alternative preventive measures against injection drugs are still the applicable way to control spread of the HBV among the IDUs in Bangladesh.

There was an association with age and duration of assignment to the unit. Having social contact with an identified hepatitis patient and the sharing of personal hygiene items with a case were significant risk factors for HBV infection. Through the use of anonymous questionnaires, the case-control study evaluated various behavioural factors. Univariate analysis indicated moderate but not significant increases in risk associated with a history of multiple sex partners and a history of disciplinary problems while in the military. Six drug-use related risk factors were significantly associated with HBV infection on univariate analysis. When evaluated with multivariate analysis, the only risk factor that was significantly associated with HBV infection was injection of drugs while assigned to the study unit.

HBV genotypes were determined by BLAST comparison analysis of the surface (S) or preS gene sequence. To illustrate the distribution of genotypes identified amongst acute cases in BC, an annotated map was produced showing the global occurrence of HBV genotypes. The majority of acute HBV cases occurred in Caucasian, Canadian-born males, with 30% of cases reporting injection drug use (IDU) and 21% reporting incarceration. The most common genotype observed was genotype D (62.9%), followed by genotypes A (18.6%), C (11.4%), B (4.3%), and E (1.4%). A significant association was observed between Genotype D and IDU (P = 0.0025) and previous incarceration (P = 0.0067). Phylogenetic analysis of the S gene sequence demonstrated identical or high genetic relatedness amongst genotype D viral strains (86% sub-genotype D3), thus verifying transmission clustering amongst BC injection drug users. The association between acute HBV genotype and reported transmission modes has not been previously described in North America. Tracking of genotypes can help identify disease transmission patterns and target at-risk populations for preventive immunization."

This -863C allele was not in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DR13 suggesting that other genetic markers linked with -863C might influence clearance of chronic HBV infection in Thai.

Haplotype analysis (-863/-308/-238) revealed that the homozygosity of the haplotype (CGG/CGG) was a protective marker for HCC (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.17-0.79, P(c) = 0.02). One can propose that carriers of -863A genotype are associated with increased levels of TNF-alpha in the liver in response to HBV infection and induce hapatocyte damage that may finally lead to HCC development. Additional study is needed to validate these finding and to further explore the genetic pathogenesis of HBV infection."

In all, 1372 consecutive, unselected HCV antibody-positive mothers and their infants were studied. Maternal HIV-1 coinfection (crude odds ratios [OR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.66; P =.007) and IDU (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.37-1.78; P <.00001) were linked to mother-to-child HCV transmission in unadjusted analysis when all anti-HCV-positive mothers were evaluated. When only HCV RNA-positive mothers were evaluated, maternal IDU, but not maternal HIV-1 coinfection, was significantly associated with mother-to-child HCV transmission. Multivariable analysis confirmed the link between maternal IDU and HCV transmission (adjusted OR [AOR], 1.51; 95% CI, 1.19-1.92; P =.0006), but no association was found with HIV-1 coinfection (AOR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.73-1.33; P =.93). IDU, but not HIV-1 coinfection, seems to be a preeminent risk factor for vertical HCV transmission."
15254,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The hypothesis that probiotic administration protects the gut surface and could delay progression of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type1 (HIV-1) infection to the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was proposed in 1995. Over the last five years, new studies have clarified the significance of HIV-1 infection of the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) for subsequent alterations in the microflora and breakdown of the gut mucosal barrier leading to pathogenesis and development of AIDS. Current studies show that loss of gut CD4+ Th17 cells, which differentiate in response to normal microflora, occurs early in HIV-1 disease. Microbial translocation and suppression of the T regulatory (Treg) cell response is associated with chronic immune activation and inflammation. Combinations of probiotic bacteria which upregulate Treg activation have shown promise in suppressing pro inflammatory immune response in models of autoimmunity including inflammatory bowel disease and provide a rationale for use of probiotics in HIV-1/AIDS. Disturbance of the microbiota early in HIV-1 infection leads to greater dominance of potential pathogens, reducing levels of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus species and increasing mucosal inflammation. The interaction of chronic or recurrent infections, and immune activation contributes to nutritional deficiencies that have lasting consequences especially in the HIV-1 infected child. While effective anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has enhanced survival, wasting is still an independent predictor of survival and a major presenting symptom. Congenital exposure to HIV-1 is a risk factor for growth delay in both infected and non-infected infants. Nutritional intervention after 6 months of age appears to be largely ineffective. A meta analysis of randomized, controlled clinical trials of infant formulae supplemented with Bifidobacterium lactis showed that weight gain was significantly greater in infants who received B. lactis compared to formula alone. Pilot studies have shown that probiotic bacteria given as a supplement have improved growth and protected against loss of CD4+ T cells. The recognition that normal bacterial flora prime neonatal immune response and that abnormal flora have a profound impact on metabolism has generated insight into potential mechanisms of gut dysfunction in many settings including HIV-1 infection. As discussed here, current and emerging studies support the concept that probiotic bacteria can provide specific benefit in HIV-1 infection. Probiotic bacteria have proven active against bacterial vaginosis in HIV-1 positive women and have enhanced growth in infants with congenital HIV-1 infection. Probiotic bacteria may stabilize CD4+ T cell numbers in HIV-1 infected children and are likely to have protective effects against inflammation and chronic immune activation of the gastrointestinal immune system."

The mAb D32.10 inhibits efficiently and specifically the binding of HCVsp to human hepatocytes. Therefore, we investigated the clinical relevance of anti-E1E2A,B response in the serum of patients infected with HCV. To this end, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using synthetic E1-, E2A-, and E2B-derived peptides was used. The ELISA was validated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and test efficiency. The detection of the anti-E1E2 D32.10 epitope-binding antibodies during natural HCV infection in more than 300 HCV-positive sera demonstrated significantly (P < 0.001) higher prevalence of these antibodies: (1) in patients who spontaneously cured HCV infection (46 of 52, 88.5%) showing high titers (70% ≥ 1/1000) compared to never-treated patients with chronic hepatitis C (7 of 50, 14%) who actively replicated the virus, and (2) in complete responders (20 of 52, 38.5%) who cleared virus following treatment and achieved a sustained viral response compared to nonresponders (4 of 40, 10%). Serum anti-E1E2 antibodies were monitored before, during, and after the current standard-of-care therapy (pegylated interferon plus ribavirin) in responder and nonresponder patients. Optimal cutoff values were assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. One month prior to therapy initiation, the threshold of 1131 (optical density × 1000) gave 100% and 86% positive and negative predictive values, respectively, for achieving or not achieving a sustained viral response."
11622,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Recent studies have documented dramatic decreases in opportunistic infections, hospitalizations, and mortality among HIV-infected persons, owing primarily to the advent of highly active antiretroviral medications. Unfortunately, not all segments of the population living with HIV benefit equally from treatment. In San Francisco, only about 30% of the HIV-infected urban poor take combination highly active antiretroviral medications, as compared with 88% of HIV-infected gay men. Practitioners who care for the urban poor are reluctant to prescribe these medications, fearing inadequate or inconsistent adherence to the complicated medical regimen. Persons typically must take 2 to 15 pills at a time, 2 to 3 times a day. Some of the medications require refrigeration, which may not be available to the homeless poor. Most homeless persons do not have food available to them on a consistent schedule. Therefore, they may have difficulty adhering to instructions to take medications only on an empty stomach or with food. Lack of a safe place to store medications may be an issue for some. In addition, many urban poor live with drug, alcohol, or mental health problems, which can interfere with taking medications as prescribed. Inconsistent adherence to medication regimens has serious consequences. Patients do not benefit fully from treatments, and they will become resistant to the medications in their regimen as well as to other medications in the same classes as those in their regimen. Development of resistance has implications for the broader public health, because inadvertent transmission of multidrug-resistant strains of HIV has been demonstrated. Concern that the urban poor will not adhere to highly active antiretroviral medication regimens has led to debate on the role of clinicians and public health officials in determining who can comply with these regimens. Rather than define the characteristics that would predict adherence to these regimens, the San Francisco Department of Public Health created a program to support adherence among those who may have the greatest difficulty complying with complicated highly active antiretroviral medication regimens. The program, dubbed the Action Point Adherence Project, was conceived through a community planning process in preparation for a city-wide summit on HIV/AIDS that took place in January 1998. Action Point is funded by the city and the county of San Francisco. Now in its 10th month, the program continues to show promising evidence of improving clients' biological and social indicators."
10918,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"HIV-infected patients commonly experience haematological disturbances including anemia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow failure may be caused by HIV itself, or by secondary involvement by opportunistic pathogens and malignancy. The need for multiple concomitant suppressive treatments may increase the risk of cytopenias. Strategy to reduce both anemia and neutropenia as well as to improve the haematological tolerance to myelotoxic agents have been developed by using haematological growth factors. So far, erythropoietin and granulocyte(macrophage) colony-stimulating factors have been successfully used in clinical trials including HIV-patients with either zidovudine-associated anemia or severe HIV or drug-induced neutropenia. However, according to the cost of these palliative approaches, there is a need for more reliable data showing that these growth factors could really have a major impact on the patient's compliance to therapy, reduction of hospitalization and infection rate and improvement of the overall survival."

For each HCV-1/2 patient with histological data available, two age- and sex-matched HCV-1 and HCV-2 infected patients were selected for comparison, respectively. Of the 2776 patients, 261 (9.4%) patients were identified as having mixed HCV-1/2 infection. The histological severity did not differ among HCV-1/2 patients and controls. The proportion of patients with the interleukin-28B (IL-28B) rs8099917 TT genotype did not differ between patients with mixed-1/2 and HCV-1 infection (82.6% vs. 86.5%, p = 0.38). However, HCV-2 infected patients had a significantly higher proportion of the rs8099917 TT genotype compared to patients with mixed HCV-1/2 infections (91.6% vs. 82.6%, p = 0.03). The HCV RNA levels were similar in patients with HCV-1/2 and HCV-1 infections (5.5 ± 0.8 log IU/mL vs. 5.5 ± 0.9 log IU/L, p = 0.73), which were both significantly higher than that of HCV-2 infection (5.1 ± 0.9 log IU/mL, both p < 0.001). Linear regression analysis revealed that the factors of HCV-1/2 infection [β: 0.204; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.183-0.598, p < 0.001], body weight (β: 0.150; CI: 0.003-0.021, p = 0.008), and age (β: -0.139; CI: -0.020 to -0.002, p = 0.01) were independently correlated with HCV RNA levels in patients with HCV-2 and mixed HCV-1/2 infection. We concluded that the host genetic and viral presentations of patients with mixed HCV-1/2 infection were more similar to those of patients with HCV-1 infection than patients with HCV-2 infection."
15833,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The emergence of drug-resistant variants during antiretroviral therapy is a serious obstacle to sustained suppression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). For that reason, resistance assays are essential to guide clinicians in the selection of optimal treatment regimens. Genotypic assays are less expensive and results are available faster than phenotypic assays. However, in heavily experienced patients with multiple treatment failures interpretation of complex mutation patterns remains difficult, and in these cases phenotypic assays are recommended. This report describes a novel recombinant virus assay where protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences derived from the plasma isolated from patients are introduced into the back-bone of an HIV molecular clone that expresses Renilla luciferase protein in the place of nef gene. All drug resistance profiles analyzed correlate with previously reported data and showed high reproducibility. This assay, in addition to a fast (completed in 10 days), precise, reproducible and automated method, presents several advantages as compared to other phenotypic assays. The system described below allows the generation of recombinant viruses with multiples cycles of replication carrying a reporter gene in their genomes. These features increase the sensitivity of the test, an important aspect to be considered in the evaluation of less fit viral isolates. In conclusion, the assay permits the quantitation of the level of resistance of clinical HIV-1 isolates to PR and RT inhibitors."

Seventy-one HCV+ve renal transplant patients with a functioning graft for whom a post renal transplant liver biopsy was available, were included. Serum HGV RNA was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction before, at the time of, and after renal transplantation. A total of 21 (30%) of the HCV+ve RT patients had a positive HGV RNA (Group 1); seventeen of these patients (81%) were already HGV RNA+ve when the most recent renal transplantation was performed. The other 4 patients became HGV RNA+ve following renal transplantation. The mean duration of HGV infection was at least 119 +/- 64 months (18-240). Patients in group 1 did not statistically differ from the 50 HGV RNA-ve/HCV+ve RT patients (Group 2) according to sex ratio; time on dialysis; number of blood transfusions; HLA matching; the duration of HCV infection; duration and type of immunosuppression or levels of liver enzymes i.e. aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase; serum HCV RNA concentration; or frequency of genotype 1b. However, Group 1 patients were statistically younger (41 +/- 10 y compared to 47 +/- 10 y; p = 0.016) than Group 2 patients. Liver histology showed a significantly lower degree of fibrosis in Group 1 (0.4 +/- 0.5) than in Group 2 (1 +/- 1.2; p = 0.02); two patients from Group 2 but none of Group 1 had overt cirrhosis. Conversely, the extent of hepatic inflammation and hepatocellular necrosis was not statistically different between the two groups. The number of patients who experienced at least one acute rejection episode was significantly higher in Group 1 (76.2%) than in Group 2 (46%; p = 0.02), although the difference was no longer significant in the multivariate analysis. In conclusion, this study shows that: i) HGV infection was often present when the patients seroconverted for HCV; ii) HGV RNA+ve/HCV+ve RT patients experience acute rejection more frequently than HGV RNA-ve/HCV+ve RT patients; iii) HGV infection seems to have no detrimental effect upon liver enzymes or liver histology in HCV+ve RT patients."

Inflammation has been associated with albuminuria. The pathophysiology of albuminuria in HIV-infected individuals is poorly understood. We investigated the association of albuminuria with inflammatory biomarkers among HIV-infected individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). This is a cross-sectional analysis of participants enrolled in the Hawaii Aging with HIV-Cardiovascular Cohort. Plasma inflammatory biomarkers were assessed using the Milliplex Human Cardiovascular disease multiplex assays. A random urine sample was collected for albumin measurement. Albuminuria was defined as urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio of ≥30 mg/g. Framingham risk score was calculated and divided into three classes. Simple and multivariable logistic regression analyses were utilized to assess the correlation between plasma inflammatory biomarkers and albuminuria and were adjusted for Framingham risk category. Among 111 HIV-infected patients [median (IQR) age of 52 (46-57) years, 86% male, median (IQR) CD4 count of 489 (341-638) cells/mm(3), 85% with HIV RNA <50 copies/ml], 18 subjects (16.2%) had moderately increased albuminuria (albuminuria range between 30 and 300 mg/g) and 2 subjects (1.8%) had severely increased albuminuria (albuminuria more than 300 mg/g). In multivariable logistic models, sE-selectin, sVCAM-1, CRP, SAA, and SAP remained significantly associated with albuminuria after adjustment of CVD risk factors. This study showed an association between inflammation and albuminuria independent of previously reported risk factors for albuminuria in HIV-infected subjects who were on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Chronic inflammation despite potent antiretroviral treatment may contribute to higher rates of albuminuria among HIV-infected patients."

Zidovudine monotherapy does not appear to alter this outcome. To examine the role of didanosine (ddI) monotherapy in phenotype expression, HIV-1 isolates from 73 patients receiving ddI for up to 72 weeks were analyzed. After 12 weeks, the number of isolates expressing an NSI phenotype was 29% higher than at the start of treatment. Patients receiving high-dose ddI (375 mg twice daily) were significantly more likely to express the NSI phenotype at 12 weeks than patients who received low-dose ddI (100 mg twice daily), even after adjustment for phenotype and CD4 cell count at baseline, suggesting that ddI may be selective against the faster-replicating virus. ddI at 375 mg twice daily significantly increases the probability of an NSI phenotype over the short term in patients with advanced HIV disease."

Patients with frailty phenotype are at higher risk of adverse outcomes (worsening mobility, disability, hospitalization, and death within three years).Our study aimed to evaluate prevalence of frailty in elderly HIV-infected patients and to assess whether frailty is associated with HIV and geriatric factors, comorbidities, and precariousness in a French cohort of older HIV infected.This 18-month cross-sectional multicenter study carried in 2013 to 2014 had involved 502 HIV-infected patients aged 50 years and older, cared in 18 HIV-dedicated hospital medical units, located in South of France.Prevalence of frailty was 6.3% and of pre-frailty 57.2%. Low physical activity and weakness were the main frailty markers, respectively 49.4% and 19.9%. In univariate models, precariousness, duration of HIV antiretroviral treatment >15 years, 2 comorbidities or more, risk of depression, activities of daily living disability, and presence of pain were significantly associated with frail and pre-frail phenotype. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that only pain was significantly different between frail and pre frail phenotype versus non frail phenotype (odds ratio = 1.2; P = .002).Our study is the first showing a significant association between pain and frailty phenotype in older patients infected by HIV. As frailty phenotype could be potentially reversible, a better understanding of the underlying determinant is warranted. Further studies are needed to confirm these first findings."
9134,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically improved the life expectancy of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Specific toxicities cited for HAART include elevations in serum levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides, reduction in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alterations in the distribution of body fat, increases in insulin resistance, and diabetes, which are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The majority of the studies examining the incidence of CV events demonstrated an increase in CV event rate with HAART in the HIV-infected population. Overall, the CVD risk appears to be greater in the HIV-infected population than in the general population, and the increased CV risk is associated with HAART, particularly with protease inhibitor use. Despite the relative risk (RR) for CVD being significantly high (the hazard ratio for myocardial infarction ranging between 1.3 and 7.1), the absolute risk for CVD remains low, with the CV event rates ranging between one and seven events per 1000 person-years. Although there is general consensus that the benefits of HAART far outweigh toxicity-related risks of the treatment with HAART, prolonged survival among HIV-infected patients will likely support the use of different antiretroviral regimens with potentially less CV toxicity in the future."

Two hundred fifteen adults were enrolled over a 5-month period and randomized to receive ribavirin 800 mg daily (74 subjects), ribavirin 600 mg (71 subjects), or placebo (70 subjects). Active treatment was administered for 24 weeks followed by a 4-week wash-out period. Fifteen patients receiving placebo, 10 receiving ribavirin 600 mg, and 18 receiving ribavirin 800 mg developed AIDS during the 28-week study period. Ribavirin at daily doses of 600 mg or 800 mg for 24 weeks did not significantly affect the rate of progression to AIDS as defined by the Centers for Disease Control, in univariate analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, or Cox proportional hazards modeling. Although in the proportional hazards analysis, the dose-response regression coefficients indicated a reduction of 43% in the hazard of progression to AIDS among patients on active treatment, it was not statistically significant (p = 0.19). Furthermore, there was no evidence that ribavirin had a significant effect upon any immunologic or virologic parameter measured, including CD4 count, CD4:CD8 ratio, lymphocyte proliferative response, skin test reactivity, interferon-gamma production, peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or level of HIV p24 antigen in serum. The most prominent adverse effect of ribavirin was induction of a mild reversible hemolytic anemia (mean fall in hematocrit, 5%). No severe or unremitting drug reaction was documented."

Genotype H identified in Central America is associated with low incidence of liver disease and HCC, but higher incidence of occult HBV (low level HBV DNA positivity, HBsAg negative). The replication phenotype of genotype H associated with less severe forms of liver disease is unknown. We hypothesized that the reduced pathogenesis associated with this genotype may be due to by lower rates of viral replication and/or secretion compared to other characterised strains. We used transient transfection and infection cell culture models to characterise the replication phenotype, compared to our D3 reference strain. Genotype H exhibited reduced viral replication and altered envelope protein expression compared to genotype D, with functional studies showing that low replication was in part likely due to sequence differences in the major transcriptional regulatory region."

Despite this it is important for preventing HIV infection and mitigating its impacts. This study aims to describe disclosure of HIV diagnosis and factors associated with it among a cohort of patients receiving antiretroviral treatment in eastern Ethiopia. A descriptive study was conducted among a random sample of patients that started antiretroviral treatment in three hospitals located in eastern Ethiopia. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used to examine association and derive odds ratios (OR) as well as 95% confidence intervals. A total of 1540 study participants were included in the study, where 963 (62.5%) were females and 574 (37.3%) males. Most of the married participants have disclosed to their wife or husband (402, 66.3%), but the overall sample had much lower rates of disclosure to brothers or sisters (262, 17.0%), and relatives (259, 16.8%). A small number of patients (11.6%, 179) did not disclose their infection status at all and none of the patients (0, 0%) had disclosed to all of their family members. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis patients who were not married (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.01-2.35) and illiterate (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.03-3.20) had higher odds of nondisclosure. The findings of the study revealed a lower level of HIV disclosure status compared to similar settings. Therefore, more focus should be given to unmarried and illiterate persons during counseling sessions. "

The purpose of this study was to examine perceptions of race-based and socioeconomic status (SES)-based discrimination during interactions with HIV treatment providers. We recruited 110 individuals (17% female, 51% white) living with HIV from an AIDS service organization in a midwestern city. Results indicated that the majority of participants had perceived discrimination in their interactions with providers when getting treatment for HIV. More specifically, 71% reported having experienced discrimination when receiving treatment for HIV based on their race or color, and 66% reported discrimination attributed to their socioeconomic status, position, or social class. However, participants indicated that they experienced discrimination infrequently. No significant racial/ethnic differences in reports of discrimination were observed. In addition, greater race-based and SES-based discrimination were each associated with greater levels of depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms, greater severity of AIDS-related symptoms, lower perceived general health, and less health care satisfaction. Greater SES-based discrimination was also related to lower adherence to antiretroviral medications. Our findings suggest that experiences with discrimination when getting treatment have important implications for the health and health care of HIV-positive individuals. It is important to note, however, that discrimination based on HIV status or sexual orientation was not assessed and may have affected the results. Studies that explore perceptions of discrimination based on other factors among HIV-positive individuals may improve understanding of the nature, extent, and consequences of discrimination in patient-provider interactions."

The South African Department of Health launched an HCT campaign in April 2010, and this reached 13,269,746 people by June 2011, of which 16% tested HIV positive and 400,000 of those were initiated into antiretroviral treatment. The overall objective of this project was to gain insight into the general perceptions about HIV testing in the different South African communities. Factors influencing testing in these communities were also explored. Discussions with twelve focus groups (FG) of 8-12 participants each were conducted with male and female participants recruited from both urban formal and informal communities in Cape Town and Durban. Participants included four racial groups represented by different age groups as follows: adolescents (12-17 years), youth (18-24 years) and adults (25 years and older). Data were analyzed using thematic coding. Among the key themes that emerged from the findings were the inaccurate perception of risk, fear of testing HIV positive, stigma and discrimination. Participants from both African and Indian FGs reported being less likely to do self-initiated HIV testing and counselling, while those from the FG consisting of young whites were more likely to learn about their HIV status through blood donations and campus HIV testing campaigns. Most FGs said they were likely to test if they understood the testing process better and also if the results are kept confidential. The present findings reiterate the importance of spreading positive messages and ensuring confidentiality for HIV testing in a society where there is still some stigma associated with people living with HIV/AIDS. This can partly be accomplished by the continuation of the national HCT campaign, which has been a considerable success in the fight against HIV/AIDS in South Africa during the past two years."

A total of 136 women with viral load = 500 copies/ml were included: 77 (56.6%) were treatment-naïve and 59 (43.4%) were antiretroviral-experienced patients either with current (n: 24) or previous (n = 35) antiretroviral therapy. Genotypic baseline resistance was investigated in plasma of antiretroviral-naïve patients and antiretroviral-experienced patients. The resistance mutations were identified according to the lists of the World Health Organization and the International Antiviral Society, respectively. Frequencies of resistance associated mutations detected in 2008-2011 and 2012-2014 were compared. A total of 37 (27.2%) women presented at least one resistance associated mutation: 25/94 (26.5%) in 2008-2011 and 12/42 (28.5%) in 2012-2014 (p > 0.05). Among naïves, 15 (19.5%) had at least one mutation: 10/49 (20.4%) in the period 2008-2011 and 5/28 (17.8%) in 2012-2014 (p > 0.05). The resistance mutations detected in naïves were associated with non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, being K103N the most common mutation in both periods. In antiretroviral experienced patients, 22/59 (37.3%) had at least one resistance mutation. This study demonstrates a high frequency of resistance associated mutations which remained stable in the period analyzed. These levels suggest an increased circulation of HIV-1 antiretroviral resistant strains in our setting compared to previous reports from Argentina."

Multivariate survival analysis of the prognostic factors associated with time to two consecutive plasma viral load measures below 500 copies/ml among eligible participants was undertaken to characterize response to antiretroviral therapy. There were 892 participants with available data for this analysis, of those 146 (16%) self-identified as Aboriginal. Aboriginal participants were more likely to be female (p < or = 0.001), have lower baseline plasma viral loads (p = 0.010), be co-infected with HCV (p < 0.001), live in unstable housing (p < or = 0.001), and report an income of >10K CDN (p < or = 0.001) per annum. Aboriginal people were less likely to report men who have sex with men (p < or = 0.001) and more likely to report injection drug use (p < or = 0.001) as a risk factor for HIV infection. Aboriginal participants were more likely to receive double versus triple combination antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.002), be less adherent in the first year on therapy (p = 0.001) and to have a physician less experienced with treating HIV (p < or = 0.001). When these factors were controlled for, Aboriginal people treated with triple combination therapy were as likely to respond and suppress their viral load below 500 copies. In the era of HAART, our results indicate that Aboriginal people living with HIV/AIDS were less likely to receive optimal therapy. However, when Aboriginals did receive triple drug therapy they suppressed just as well as non-Aboriginals."

However, a substantial proportion of patients demonstrates <4-fold reduction of titers after recommended therapy (serofast state). It remains unclear whether the serofast state is indicative of persistence of bacteria or only a residual immune response.The aim of the present study was to determine the association between the serofast state and the risk of neurosyphilis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and to identify potential predictors of neurosyphilis.Thirty-three patients with early syphilis and HIV co-infection were included. One year after the recommended treatment of syphilis, all patients who did not achieve proper serologic response underwent lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination.Twelve months after completing therapy for syphilis, the proportion of patients with serofast state after syphilis therapy was 36.4% (n = 12). Among them, 5 (41.7%) had neurosyphilis. Individuals who remained serofast and had neurosyphilis (n = 5) when compared to those without neurosyphilis (n = 7) were characterized by significantly lower CD4+ cell count and higher HIV RNA levels (P < .05). Moreover, a significantly higher proportion of patients with neurosyphilis was not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). The nonreceipt of ART independently increased the risk of neurosyphilis in the analyzed group of serofast HIV-infected patients (odds ratio = 4.5; 95% confidence interval 1.5-13.59, P = .003).Patients co-infected with HIV require careful serologic and clinical follow-up after therapy for syphilis. In all of the patients who do not respond serologically after treatment for syphilis, especially in those who are not receiving ART, lumbar puncture and CSF examination should be considered."

Low vitamin D levels have been observed in HIV-infected patients from high latitudes, with consequently reduced bone mineral density (BMD), but data from the tropics are scarce. We aimed to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for hypovitaminosis D among HIV-infected patients in the tropics. This was a cross-sectional study to determine serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in HIV-infected patients who attended our HIV clinic in Bangkok, Thailand from July 2010 to June 2011. Hypovitaminosis D was defined as vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency [25(OH)D 20-30 ng/ml and <20 ng/ml, respectively]. Hypovitaminosis D prevalence was calculated and risk factors were determined using multivariate logistic regression. A total of 673 HIV-infected adults were included. The median age was 41 years and 47% were females. The median body mass index (BMI) was 21.9 kg/m(2) and 93% were using antiretroviral therapy (ART), with a median (IQR) duration of 8.9 (5.0-10.4) years. Thirty-one percent were using efavirenz (EFV). The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency was 40.6% and 29.9%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, female gender [odds ratio: OR (95% confidence interval: 95% CI) 1.7 (1.2-2.3), p = 0.005], age >37 years [OR (95% CI) 1.6 (1.1-2.4), p = 0.01], and EFV use [OR (95% CI) 2.0 (1.3-3.2), p = 0.004] were independent predictors of hypovitaminosis D. Even in tropical areas where the sun is abundant, hypovitaminosis D is highly prevalent. Thus, treatment of low vitamin D in HIV-infected patients at high risk should not be ignored to prevent reductions in BMD and other hypovitaminosis D-related comorbidities."

In this respect, monotherapy with darunavir/ritonavir (mDRV/r) can be a useful treatment strategy. This prospective study analyses the effect of mDRV/r on sperm quality and viral load in a group of 28 patients who had previously been given conventional ART and who had recorded a viral load <20 copies/mL for at least six months. These patients were given mDRV/r at a dose of 800/100 mg for 48 weeks. At baseline (V0), CD4, CD8, FSH, LH and testosterone levels were measured, together with HIV-1 viral load in plasma and semen. In addition, seminal fluid quality was studied before mDRV/r treatment was prescribed. At week 48 (V1), HIV-1 viral load in plasma and semen and the quality of the seminal fluid were again measured. The results obtained indicate that at V0, 10% of the patients with ART had a positive viral load in seminal fluid (>20 copies/ml), and that at V1, after mDRV/r treatment, this figure had fallen to 3%. The quality of seminal fluid was close to normal in 57% of patients at V0 and in 62% at V1. We conclude that, similar to ART, mDRV/r maintains HIV-1 viral load in most patients, and that there is no worsening in seminal fluid quality. "

To determine prevalence of antiretroviral drug-resistant mutations in newly diagnosed subjects in a clinical setting where HAART has been widely used since 1997. One hundred and thirty-six HIV-1-infected adult patients were diagnosed with HIV infection between January 2000 and December 2006 in the HIV out-clinic at the HC/FMUSP, Sao Paulo city. These antiretroviral naïve patients were mainly referred from the blood bank, situated in the same building or elsewhere in the city. The samples were genotyped to provide HIV protease and reverse transcriptase sequence data. Major antiretroviral drug resistance mutations were classified according to Shafer et al. [Shafer, R.W., Rhee, S.Y., Pillay, D., et al., 2007. HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase mutations for drug resistance surveillance. AIDS 21, 215-223]. Thirteen cases had no DNA amplification, and 123 patients were successfully analyzed, with a mean age of 37 years and 89 (72%) were males. Antiretroviral drug resistance mutations were detected in 8/123 patients (6.5%), all eight were heterosexuals and HIV asymptomatic, the mean of the CD4 cells count was 323 cells/mm(3), and the RNA plasma viral load was 4.7 log(10)/mL. We found NRTI (n=2, 1.6%), NNRTI-resistant (n=2, 1.6%) mutations, and one cases with PI mutation (0.8%). Three cases (2.4%) showed mutations for NRTI, NNRTI or PI, simultaneously. Eighty-two percent were HIV-1 B subtype, and HIV-1 F (6.5%), HIV-1 C (5.7%) and recombinant viruses (5.8%) were observed. In an unselected cohort, primary drug resistance was seen in 6.5% of the naïve for drug ART use. These results indicate that HIV drug resistance testing should be a practical approach in monitoring first-line ART. In addition, HIV-1 C seems to be emerging in Sao Paulo city."

The patients' serum vitamin D concentration was determined using radioimmunoassay method. The possible correlations between demographic and clinical data with the level of vitamin D were evaluated. Vitamin D levels less than 35 nmol/l were considered as deficient in this study. Eighty-five (86.7%) of the patients had serum vitamin D deficiency (concentrations less than 35 nmol/l) in this study. Coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) was present in 54 (55.1%) of the patients.

The hypothesis that subclinical herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation was associated, in vivo, with increased plasma human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA and suppression with a reduced plasma HIV RNA load was investigated. HSV cultures were performed daily on HSV-2-positive/HIV-positive patients, and plasma HIV-1 RNA loads were measured at regular intervals. A subset of patients prior to, during, and after HSV suppression with high-dose acyclovir was measured to determine whether HSV suppression was associated with a decrease in HIV replication. Most (25/27 HSV-2-positive/HIV-positive persons) reactivated HSV. Total HSV shedding rate was strongly correlated with plasma HIV-1 RNA load (R=0.54; P=.004), and the plasma HIV-1 RNA level at a given CD4 cell count was 48% lower when treated with acyclovir. These data indicate that frequent mucosal HSV reactivation influences HIV replication in vivo and daily HSV suppression may be important in the management of HSV-positive/HIV-positive persons."

We investigated the immunoregulatory role of IL-12 in 72 chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers, 33 of whom were monitored longitudinally during interferon-alpha treatment. Serum levels of IL-12 heterodimer, IL-12 p40 subunit, IL-4, and Th1 cytokines were determined by specific ELISAs, and hepatitis B core antigen-specific T cell response by a proliferation assay. Chronic HBV carriers had higher serum levels of IL-12 and IL-12 p40 in comparison with controls (P < 0.01), suggesting that IL-12 production is not impaired. The longitudinal analysis revealed a further substantial increase (> 2.5x baseline level) of bioactive IL-12 and Th1 cytokines in patients who cleared HBV and seroconverted to anti- hepatitis B e, unlike the 23 nonresponders with persistent HBV replication (P < 0.01). The IL-12 peak followed the peak of hepatocytolysis by 9.8+/-2.8 wk and occurred either before or simultaneously with hepatitis B e seroconversion. Hepatitis B core antigen-specific T cell proliferation closely correlated with hepatocytolysis and increased significantly in all patients (8 responders and 15 nonresponders) who developed hepatitis flare, irrespective of the virological outcome. These results provide in vivo evidence that IL-12 may have an important role for viral clearance in chronic HBV infection."

Longitudinal data for white blood cell (WBC) counts, WBC differentials, T cell subsets, and smoking behavior were collected semiannually for up to 7 years. Prior to seroconversion, total WBC count increased in direct proportion to daily cigarette consumption, but this effect disappeared within 3 years of seroconversion. Analyses of WBC subsets (lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes) and lymphocyte subsets (CD4+, CD8+ and non-T[CD3-]) showed that smoking had only minor effects on the proportions of these cells. In contrast, HIV-1 seroconversion was associated with a dramatic decrease in CD4+ lymphocyte percentage, a large increase in CD8+ lymphocyte percentage, a small increase in total lymphocyte percentage, and small decreases in the non-T lymphocyte and granulocyte percentages. These findings indicate that the effect of smoking on CD4 cell counts is (a) nonspecific, (b) maximal in seronegative individuals; and (c) lost by 3 years after seroconversion. Although the mechanism of the loss of smoking-induced leukocytosis after seroconversion remains to be determined, our results suggest that the effects of smoking are not likely to be important in the clinical use of leukocyte measurements, including measurements of CD4 lymphocytes, in individuals who have been HIV-1 seropositive for more than 3 years."

Despite the important effects of the immunological and virological events of early HIV infection on subsequent disease progression, IL-12 production and immune activation in early infection remain under-defined. To quantify IL-12 production and immune activation during acute/early HIV infection, in the presence and absence of HAART, we performed a prospective, longitudinal study of participants in the Baltimore site of the Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program, with cross-sectional comparison to healthy control subjects. PBMC cytokine productive capacity and plasma immune activation markers [soluble CD8 (sCD8), sCD4, granzyme B, neopterin, beta2-microglobulin, sIL-2R, sTNFRI, sTNFRII, and IL-12p70] were quantified by ELISA. Notably, PBMC from patients with acute/early HIV infection exhibited in vivo IL-12p70 production along with increased, maximal in vitro IL-12 production. Further, despite evidence from plasma markers of generalized immune activation, no elevation in plasma levels of sCD4 was observed, suggesting relative blunting of in vivo CD4+ T cell activation from the beginning of HIV infection. Finally, despite successful virological responses to HAART, heightened in vivo CD8+ T cell activation, IL-12 production, and IFN activity were sustained for at least 6 months during primary HIV infection. These data underscore the need for comparative mechanistic analysis of the immunobiology of early and chronic HIV infection."

Indeed, the ability of HSV-2 to induce massive infiltration at the genital level of cells which are potential targets for HIV-1 infection may represent one of the mechanisms involved in this process. Here we show that infection of human primary macrophages (MDMs) by HSV-2 results in an increase of CCR5 expression levels on cell surface and allows higher efficiency of MDMs to support entry of R5 HIV-1 strains. This finding could strengthen, at the molecular level, the evidence linking HSV-2 infection to an increased susceptibility to HIV-1 acquisition."

This increased longevity has led to a heightened focus on the comorbidities which may arise, allowing a clearer understanding of the contextual, personal, psychological and functional problems and their interrelations. Disability (functional limitations) and insufficient nutritional intake may interact cyclically with HIV and/or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); however, no research to date has investigated this interaction. Aims: The objective of this article was to report on the nutritional outcomes using albumin and body mass index outcomes as a subset of a larger study among adults living with HIV and/or AIDS. Setting: This study was conducted at a large HIV clinic based in an urban area in Johannesburg, South Africa, which provides HIV treatment and support to over 6000 persons with HIV and TB. This clinic is part of a large public health regional hospital where extensive HIV research is undertaken. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional observational study. The sample composed of 278 participants between 18 and 65 years of age and had been on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for more than six months. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Results: The results indicated that albumin level had significant inverse associations with functional limitations and physical health symptoms. Women were significantly more likely to have lower nutritional levels. A logistic regression analysis suggested that gender and physical health symptoms were the primary predictors of albumin levels. Conclusion: The findings presented in this article can be applied to HIV and/or AIDS treatment programmes, such as HAART. It re-emphasises the importance of providing individuals on anti-retroviral therapy with affordable and adequate nutrition, education on the importance of nutritional intake and the benefits of potentially adopting supplement programmes. As females seem to be more adversely affected by low nutritional levels, with the findings showing an increased likelihood of developing physical health symptoms, focus also needs to be given to cultural or social factors that impact nutritional intake in women."

In this study, we investigated the influence of TTV infection on the clinical features and response to interferon (IFN) therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C. We studied 247 patients who had received a 16- or a 24-week course of IFN-alpha therapy. The serum of these patients was analysed for TTV DNA using a hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction and TTV was detected in 114 patients (46%). No significant differences were found with respect to clinical features (gender, age, liver-related biochemical tests, hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype and serum HCV RNA levels) between the patients who were positive for TTV DNA and those who were negative for TTV DNA. The fibrosis score was higher in TTV-positive patients (2.1 +/- 1.1) than in TTV-negative patients (1.7 +/- 1.1, P = 0.023). The biochemical sustained-response rate was 25% in TTV-positive patients and 25% in TTV-negative patients (not significant). A sustained HCV clearance rate was achieved in 26% of TTV-positive patients and in 22% of TTV-negative patients (not significant). TTV DNA clearance after IFN therapy was observed in 36 of 69 patients (52%) for whom stored serum samples were available. The disappearance of TTV DNA had no effect on the biochemical response to IFN therapy. In conclusion, TTV co-infection is frequently observed in Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C. In chronic hepatitis C, TTV does not modify the clinical features or the response to IFN."

Transmission of HCV is primarily via parenteral blood exposure, and HCV can be transmitted vertically from mother to child. Vertical transmission occurs in 5.8% (95% confidence interval = 4.2%-7.8%) of infants born to women who are infected only with HCV and in up to twice as many infants born to women who are also infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (2) or who have high HCV viral loads (3,4); there is currently no recommended intervention to prevent transmission of infection from mother to child (3). Increased reported incidence of HCV infection among persons aged ≤30 years (5,6) with similar increases among women and men in this age group (6), raises concern about increases in the number of pregnant women with HCV infection, and in the number of infants who could be exposed to HCV at birth. Data from one large commercial laboratory and birth certificate data were used to investigate trends in HCV detection among women of childbearing age,* HCV testing among children aged ≤2 years, and the proportions of infants born to HCV-infected women nationally and in Kentucky, the state with the highest incidence of acute HCV infection during 2011-2014 (6). During 2011-2014, commercial laboratory data indicated that national rates of HCV detection (antibody or RNA positivity(†)) among women of childbearing age increased 22%, and HCV testing (antibody or RNA) among children aged ≤2 years increased 14%; birth certificate data indicated that the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected mothers increased 68%, from 0.19% to 0.32%.

We  examined -403G>A and -28C>G RANTES gene variants in 473 healthy controls  and 484 HBV patients in ethnic Saudi populations. Significant differences were  found in the genotype and allele distributions of the SNPs between the controls  and the HBV patients. Both SNPs were significantly linked to viral clearance in  these subjects. Our data demonstrate for the first time in a Saudi population,  a relationship between the RANTES gene polymorphisms and the clinical course of  HBV infection and underscore the importance of evaluating the genetic  background of the affected individual to determine how it may affect disease  progression."

One of the contributing factors to HIV spread among this group is the use of crystal methamphetamine (""meth""). The objective was to review the behavioral impact of crystal meth use in HIV-infected MSM and potential treatment options. A systematic review of MEDLINE identified studies that evaluated the clinical effects of crystal meth on the HIV-infected MSM population. Search terms included HIV, methamphetamine, MSM, antiretroviral therapy, adherence, resistance, and treatment. U.S. citations in the English language in peer-reviewed journals until December 2010 were included. The primary author reviewed eligible articles, and relevant data including study design, sample, and outcomes were entered into an electronic data table. The 61 included studies highlight that HIV-infected MSM who use crystal meth are more likely to report high-risk sexual behaviors, incident sexually transmitted infections, and serodiscordant unprotected anal intercourse, compared to HIV-infected MSM who do not use crystal meth. Medication adherence in this population is notably low, which may contribute to transmission of resistant virus. No medications have proven effective in the treatment of crystal meth addiction, and the role of behavioral therapies, such as contingency management are still in question. HIV-infected MSM who abuse crystal meth have worse HIV-related health outcomes. Behavioral interventions have shown variable results in treating crystal meth addiction, and more investigation into rehabilitation options are needed. The results presented support efforts to develop and implement novel interventions to reduce crystal meth use in HIV-infected MSM."

We therefore selected 28 neurologically asymptomatic HIV-seropositive homosexual men (category A, CDC 1993) without other recognized reasons for peripheral nerve disease and 20 age, sex and height matched healthy controls for a prospective nerve conduction study. Nine (32%) HIV-seropositive patients had single nerve conduction abnormalities and 2 (7%) had at least two abnormalities considered to be indicative of subclinical neuropathy. Even patients with normal CD4 cell counts showed significantly lower mean sural nerve conduction velocities and higher tibial distal motor latencies compared to controls (ANOVA; p < 0.05). There was an overall trend toward more frequent nerve conduction changes in subgroups with abnormal CD4 cell counts, lymphocyte responsiveness or beta 2-microglobulin levels. Using strict selection criteria subclinical nerve conduction changes can be found even in the absence of symptomatic HIV-disease or potential confounding factors suggesting that HIV-1 plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of associated peripheral nervous system disease."
9918,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with impairment of HBV-specific immune responses. Recently, it has been shown that regulatory T (Treg) cells downregulate HBV-specific immune responses but their role in chronic hepatitis B is still controversial. We hypothesized that liver injury enhances the influence of Treg cells on HBV-specific immune responses. The frequency of Treg cell and the in vitro expansion of HBV-specific CD8+ T cell detected by the tetramer method were investigated in 79 patients with chronic hepatitis B. Thirty-three healthy volunteers were enrolled to measure the frequency of Treg cell as controls. The results showed that in chronic hepatitis B cases, the frequency of Treg cells in peripheral blood was significantly higher than that in normal volunteers. The higher level of serum transaminase was associated with higher frequency of Treg cells, which both had a linear correlation relationship. HBV-DNA level, HBe status, age and sex had no statistical association with Treg cell frequency. Furthermore, in patients with higher serum transaminase levels, the expansion of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells was higher after removal of Treg cells when compared with patients with lower serum transaminase levels. In conclusion, our data indicate a significant association between serum transaminase level and frequency/activity of Treg cells. Based on this observation, we propose that liver-injury enhances Treg cell frequency/activity in chronic hepatitis B patients."

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) suppresses the PPAR gamma-mediated transactivation in liver cancerous cell lines. However, the role of PPAR gamma in patients with chronic HBV infection has not fully demonstrated. Our present study was firstly to determine the clinical relevance of peripheral PPAR gamma mRNA levels in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, and then, the DNA methylation of PPAR gamma promoter was investigated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 91 CHB patients and 18 healthy controls. The mRNA level of PPAR gamma was determined by quantitative real-time PCR; meanwhile, the CpG island methylation was assessed by methylation-specific PCR. CHB patients showed significantly lower mRNA level of PPAR gamma than healthy controls (P = 0.005). The mRNA level was decreased in HBV-DNA-positive group than HBV-DNA-negative group (P = 0.041). Interaction analysis demonstrated that the DNA methylation pattern was responsible for the suppression of peripheral PPAR gamma transcription in CHB patients (P = 0.003). Furthermore, the hypermethylation of PPAR gamma gene promoter was significantly associated with liver inflammation and fibrosis in CHB. In conclusion, DNA methylation patterns were responsible for the decreased mRNA level of peripheral PPAR gamma in CHB patients. Liver inflammation and fibrosis were found to be associated with hypermethylation of PPAR gamma promoter."

The increase in sustained virological response rates obtained with the recently available HCV protease inhibitors in treatment-naïve genotype-1 patients has generated considerable hope in these co-infected patients. However, several particularities (such as a higher baseline HCV load, more advanced liver fibrosis, frequent co-morbidities, and the risk of toxicity and drug-drug interactions) have not allowed the direct extrapolation of the results observed in HCV-monoinfected patients to patients with HIV-HCV co-infection. Yet, despite these uncertainties and the little available data from ongoing trials, several proposals can be made not only because the patients and drugs are ready and waiting, but also because the clock is ticking. In general, it can be advocated that HCV triple therapy should be offered to most HIV-infected patients with advanced liver fibrosis, but should be deferred or discussed on a case-by-case basis in those with mild-to-moderate fibrosis. However, such proposals rely on a relatively small amount of evidence and many questions are still pending, as studies in HIV-HCV co-infected patients have been late in coming and are several years behind those in HCV-monoinfected patients. Thus, this situation, in the context of more rapid and more severe infection, and lower response rates with standard care (pegylated interferon and ribavirin), along with the many potential drug-drug interactions (particularly with antiretroviral therapy), underscores the need for earlier evaluation of new strategies, schedules and new direct-acting antivirals in HIV-infected patients."

We cultured the pharynx of 264 asymptomatic HIV-positive MSM in downtown Madrid. A questionnaire on sexual and drug use risk behaviours was also administered. Gonococci were isolated in 25 (9.5%). Among the whole study population, 65% had a history of sexual intercourse with two or more partners on a single day and 26% were involved in group sex with other men. Only 29% regularly used condoms in all sexual encounters and 63% used condoms only in insertive anal intercourse. When asked about oral sex, 89% of patients engaged in insertive and/or receptive oral sex and 86% recognized that they did not regularly request the use of condoms when practising ""fellatio"" on a partner. Cocaine, crystal methamphetamine or alcohol use and a previous history of ≥1 sexually transmitted infection were significantly more common among culture-positive patients. Gonococcal colonization of the pharynx was self-limited in patients that were not treated and re-cultured a mean 18.5 ± 5.2 days after diagnosis. Asymptomatic pharyngeal gonorrhoea is common among HIV-positive MSM and may contribute to the increasing epidemic of gonorrhoea in Madrid. "

Once weekly for 14 weeks or until a macaque became infected, 12 male macaques were inoculated intrarectally with amounts of SHIV(SF162P3) (10 median tissue culture infective doses; 3.8 x 10(5) virus particles) that were approximately 5-fold higher than the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA levels noted in human semen during an acute infection. Of the 12 macaques, 4 received oral TDF daily, 4 received oral TDF once weekly, and 4 (control animals) received no TDF. The control animals became infected after receiving a median of 1.5 virus inoculations; macaques receiving TDF daily (1 macaque remained uninfected after 14 inoculations) and those receiving TDF weekly became infected after a median duration of 6.0 and 7.0 weeks, respectively. Although infection was delayed in treated macaques, compared with control macaques, the differences were not statistically significant (P=.315); however, the study was limited by the small numbers of animals evaluated and the variability in blood levels of TDF that resulted from oral dosing. These data demonstrate that treatment with oral TDF provided partial protection against SHIV infection but ultimately did not protect all TDF treated animals against multiple virus challenges."

Therefore, it is vital to the health of persons with HIV/AIDS to have access to the services of a registered dietitian, who is the essential member of the health care team for providing medical nutrition, therapy (49). The registered dietitian should take an active role in developing nutrition care protocols for HIV/AIDS in their practice setting. Dietetics professionals must take responsibility for obtaining and maintaining current knowledge in this area and should take the lead in translating current knowledge and research into practical and realistic nutrition guidelines for persons with HIV/AIDS. Further research is needed in the area of HIV/AIDS and nutrition. Registered dietitians and other members of the health care team are encouraged to conduct nutrition research in the area of nutrition interventions and the outcomes of nutrition therapy.

The conference attendees reviewed background materials and participated in 13 state-of-the-art presentations on ART provision in resource-limited countries, treatment access, ethics, community issues, and sustainability. Conferees separated into smaller groups to identify priorities for specific research agendas. Existing multinational human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinical trials networks, such as the HIVNAT (The Netherlands, Australia, and Thailand) Network, were studied as infrastructure models for research into affordable, sustainable treatment and monitoring strategies suitable for resource-limited settings. The delivery of ART in resource-limited countries is a vital priority for health care providers and the millions of people living with HIV disease.

We conducted a systematic literature review to analyze the effect of ART on these economic and quality of life indicators in developing countries and assess the state of research on these topics. We searched Ovid/Medline, PubMed, Psych Info, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the abstract database of the International AIDS Society Conference and the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. Both qualitative and quantitative studies were included, as were peer-reviewed articles, gray literature, and conference abstracts and presentations. Findings are reported from 21 publications, including 14 full-length articles, six abstracts, and one presentation (representing 16 studies). Compared to HIV-positive patients not yet on treatment, patients on ART reported significant improvements in physical, emotional and mental health, and daily function. Work performance improved and absenteeism decreased, with the most dramatic changes occurring in the first three months of treatment and then leveling off. Little research has been done on the impact of ART on household wellbeing, with modest changes in child and family wellbeing within households where adults are receiving ART reportrd so far. Most studies from developing countries have not yet assessed economic and quality of life outcomes of therapy beyond the first year; therefore, longitudinal outcomes are still unknown. Findings were limited geographically, with an emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa and adult treatment. As ART roll out extends throughout high HIV prevalence, low-resource countries and is sustained over years and decades, research on pediatric and differential gender economic and quality of life outcomes will become increasingly urgent, as will systematic evaluation of ART programs."

HIV and syphilis coinfection is particularly challenging because the infections interact synergistically thereby increasing the risk of acquisition and transmission as well as accelerating disease progression. Areas covered: This paper reviews and summarizes the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical management and prevention of HIV and syphilis coinfection among MSM. Expert commentary: Research does not support a different syphilis treatment for coinfected individuals; however, coinfection may warrant a recommendation for antiretroviral therapy. In order to reverse the epidemic of syphilis and HIV coinfection, there needs to be greater awareness, improved cultural sensitivity among health care providers, improved access to preventative services and increased screening for syphilis and HIV."

It has been prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). The guidelines are intended for use by clinicians and other health-care providers, HIV-infected patients, and policy makers in the United States. These guidelines address several OIs that occur in the United States and five OIs that might be acquired during international travel. Topic areas covered for each OI include epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prevention of exposure; prevention of disease by chemoprophylaxis and vaccination; discontinuation of primary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution; treatment of disease; monitoring for adverse effects during treatment; management of treatment failure; prevention of disease recurrence; discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution; and special considerations during pregnancy. These guidelines were developed by a panel of specialists from the United States government and academic institutions. For each OI, a small group of specialists with content-matter expertise reviewed the literature for new information since the guidelines were last published; they then proposed revised recommendations at a meeting held at NIH in June 2007. After these presentations and discussion, the revised guidelines were further reviewed by the co-editors; by the Office of AIDS Research, NIH; by specialists at CDC; and by HIVMA of IDSA before final approval and publication. The recommendations are rated by a letter that indicates the strength of the recommendation and a Roman numeral that indicates the quality of evidence supporting the recommendation, so that readers can ascertain how best to apply the recommendations in their practice environments. Major changes in the guidelines include 1) greater emphasis on the importance of antiretroviral therapy for the prevention and treatment of OIs, especially those OIs for which no specific therapy exists; 2) information regarding the diagnosis and management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes; 3) information regarding the use of interferon-gamma release assays for the diagnosis of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection; 4) updated information concerning drug interactions that affect the use of rifamycin drugs for prevention and treatment of TB; 5) the addition of a section on hepatitis B virus infection; and 6) the addition of malaria to the list of OIs that might be acquired during international travel. This report includes eleven tables pertinent to the prevention and treatment of OIs, a figure that pertains to the diagnois of tuberculosis, a figure that describes immunization recommendations, and an appendix that summarizes recommendations for prevention of exposure to opportunistic pathogens."

Serum samples were tested for anti-HCV antibodies using second-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the case of a positive result, a combination test was performed using second-generation recombinant immunoblot (RIBA) or direct detection of HCV-RNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Collected data included the patient's age, gender, cause of the kidney disease, type of dialysis treatment, number of years on dialysis, weekly dialysis time, drug addiction, co-infection with hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), number of kidney transplants, number of blood transfusions, and history of acute or chronic hepatitis. Chronic HCV infection was detected in 232 (23.6%) patients, whereas only 71 (7.2%) were infected by HBV. Logistic-regression analysis showed that HCV infection was associated with dialysis over a long period, numerous blood transfusions, female gender, kidney grafts, HBV infection, hemodialysis, and acute as well as chronic hepatitis. Multiple-correspondence analysis confirmed that the contamination was both transfusional and nosocomial. These results underscore the need for a strict compliance with ""universal precautions"" (Centers for Disease Control [CDC], Atlanta) in dialysis units and raise the question as to whether anti-HCV-positive patients should be isolated."

A clustering of such factors (metabolic syndrome [MSDR]) exponentially increases the risk. Impaired fibrinolysis and increased coagulation are additional independent risk factors for CHD. We studied the effects of protease inhibitor (PI)-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on metabolic and hemostatic parameters in 363 HIV-infected individuals, of whom 266 were receiving PI-containing HAART and 97 were treatment naive. The fasting plasma levels of insulin, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), and fibrinogen were evaluated together with the areas of visceral adipose tissue and the visceral adipose tissue/subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio. The levels of insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; visceral adipose tissue area; low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein ratio; and visceral adipose tissue/subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio were significantly increased in patients receiving PI-containing HAART compared with treatment-naive patients. The levels of PAI-1 and fibrinogen were significantly higher in patients receiving PI-containing HAART. PAI-1 levels were higher in individuals with MSDR but also in patients without MSDR who were receiving PI-containing HAART. PAI-1 was independently correlated to use of PI-containing HAART, triglyceride level, insulin level, and body mass index (p <.001). These findings suggest that patients receiving PI-containing HAART have decreased fibrinolysis and increased coagulability, which may thus represent additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease in this patient group."

These infections include progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, toxoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis. A resurgence of tuberculosis and neurosyphilis has also been documented. Mass lesions, meningoencephalitis, demyelination, atrophy, and vascular lesions are the commonly encountered imaging findings. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved both the clinical and radiologic findings in HIV-infected patients and reduced the number of opportunistic infections. In countries that use HAART, AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) dementia complex is becoming the most common neurologic complication of HIV infection, whereas opportunistic infections are still the major cause of neurologic complications in patients from countries that do not commonly use HAART. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, which occurs in some patients in the weeks to months after the institution of HAART, may alter the typical imaging appearance of infectious diseases involving the CNS. Knowledge of the spectrum of imaging findings of these infectious diseases, as well as the effect that treatment has on imaging appearances, is important in the evaluation of HIV-infected patients."

After adjustment for changes in CD4 cell count and use of antiretroviral treatment in Cox proportional hazards models, the risk of MAC decreased with increasing calendar time (hazard ratio per calendar year; HR = 0.58 [95% confidence intervals: 0.45-0.74], whereas this was not the case for TB; 0.95 [0.74-1.22]). In conclusion, we documented marked decreases in the incidence of TB and to an even larger extent of MAC among HIV-infected patients from 1994 to 1999. The decrease in TB was associated with the introduction of HAART and changes in CD4 cell count. These factors could also explain some of the decrease in MAC over time, though there remained a significantly lower risk of MAC than expected."

From June 1994 to June 2002, a total of six patients, four males and two females with a median age of 43 years (range, 30 to 74 years), had been diagnosed with LA. The estimated incidence of LA was 5.1 per 1000 patient-years (PYs) on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.5-5.5 per 1000 PYs) and 4.4 per 1000 PY on nucleoside analogues (NAs) (95% CI, 3.9-4.7 per 1000 PYs). Their median body mass index at diagnosis of LA was 17.6 kg/m(2) (range 16.3 to 22.6 kg/m(2)). The median CD4+ lymphocyte count at the initial diagnosis of HIV infection and at the onset of LA was 38 cells/ micro L (range, 4 to 103 cells/ micro L) and 108 cells/ micro L (range, 79 to 224 cells/ micro L), respectively. The most common symptoms were nausea, vomiting, and dyspnoea. All of the patients had findings suggestive of NA-related mitochondrial toxicity, such as myositis, pancreatitis, fatty hepatitis, peripheral neuropathy or lipodystrophy. The prescribed NA related to LA were stavudine in six patients, lamivudine, five, and didanosine, one. Despite treatment, all patients died of persistent circulatory collapse following LA. The median duration from diagnosis to death was eight days (range, 4-17 days). Our report highlights that clinicians caring for patients with AIDS should be alerted to the potentially fatal LA associated with antiretroviral therapy when patients present with low body mass index, lipodystrophy, unexplained abdominal symptoms, dyspnoea, or elevated aminotransferases."

Five hundred and four subjects were included. Among these, 201 (39.9%) had features of lipodystrophy syndrome (cases); 303 (60.1%) constituted the control group. Compared with the control group, the lipodystrophy subjects were different in age (P = 0.01); duration of antiretroviral therapy (P < 0.001); length of exposure to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (P < 0.001) and to protease inhibitors (P < 0.001); nadir of CD4 cell count (P < 0.001); and value of plasma HIV-RNA before antiretroviral therapy (P = 0.008). In a multivariate analysis, length of therapy and a nadir CD4 cell count below 250 cell/microl were associated with an increased risk of lipodystrophy. Among patients with lipodystrophy, isolated fat loss was observed in 46 (23%); isolated fat accumulation in 40 (20%); mixed (loss and accumulation) syndrome in 50 (25%); and isolated metabolic changes in 65 (32%). Subjects with morphological alterations displayed a greater cumulative time of exposure to NRTIs and to protease inhibitors than patients with isolated metabolic alterations.

However, some individuals intermittently shed HIV RNA in semen despite suppression of viremia, a phenomenon termed ""isolated HIV semen shedding (IHS)"". In a previously reported clinical study, we collected blood and semen samples from HIV-infected men for 6 months after ART initiation, and documented IHS at ≥1 visit in almost half of the participants, independent of ART regimen or semen drug levels. We now report the mucosal immune associations of IHS in these men. Blood and semen plasma cytokine levels were assayed by multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, T-cell populations were evaluated by flow cytometry in freshly isolated blood and semen mononuclear cells, and semen cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA levels were measured by PCR. Although IHS was not associated with altered blood or semen cytokine levels, the phenomenon was associated with a transient, dramatic increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation that was restricted to the semen compartment. All participants were CMV infected, and although semen CMV reactivation was common despite ART, this was not associated with T-cell activation or IHS. Further elucidation of the causes of compartmentalized mucosal T-cell activation and IHS may have important public health implications."

Among these are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which produces acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans, and murine leukemia virus (MuLV), which produces leukemias in rodents. We have obtained the first atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of these two retroviruses, both isolated from culture media and emerging from infected cell surfaces. The HIV virions are 127 nm diameter on average, and those of MuLV are 145 nm, although there are wide distributions about the means. The AFM images show the arrangement of the envelope protein, responsible for host cell entry, on the surfaces of both virions. Disruption of the viruses using detergents or physical means allowed us to visualize interior structures, including the outer shells of both MuLV and HIV, the cores of MuLV, and the nucleic acid of HIV complexed with core proteins. Using immunolabeling techniques borrowed from electron microscopy, we were able to demonstrate the binding of gold-labeled antibodies directed against the envelope protein of MuLV. The AFM images are revealing, not only in terms of surface topology, but in terms of interior features as well, and they reveal the eccentricities and uniqueness of individual virus particles rather than yielding the average member of the population. Further application of AFM to viruses associated with other pathologies may ultimately have a significant impact on the diagnosis and treatment of virus-promoted diseases."

Because previous findings suggested that disease stage, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and HIV-1 RNA levels in plasma may influence CSF viral burden, these variables were examined as potential modifying factors. HIV-1 RNA levels were quantified by using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. Performance on a comprehensive neuropsychological (NP) battery was noted in 97 prospectively enrolled, HIV-infected subjects. Among subjects with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (<200 CD4+ lymphocytes), NP impairment was associated with significantly higher CSF RNA levels (3.1 vs 1.8 log10 copies/ml; p = 0.02); most impaired subjects met criteria for HIV-associated dementia or minor cognitive-motor disorder. In subjects without AIDS, CSF RNA and NP impairment were unrelated. Before AIDS, CSF RNA was strongly correlated to plasma RNA and to pleocytosis, but in AIDS, CSF and plasma RNA were independent. In conclusion, we found elevated CSF HIV-1 RNA levels in NP impaired subjects with AIDS. Before AIDS, systemic viral replication, possibly through CD4+ mononuclear cell trafficking, may govern virus levels in CSF, whereas in AIDS, CD4 cell depletion may unmask a correlation between increased productive central nervous system HIV infection and clinical neurocognitive disorders."
6424,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"A stable latent reservoir for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in resting memory CD4+ T cells presents a barrier to eradication of the infection even in patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy. Potential mechanisms for latency include inaccessibility of the integrated viral genome, absence of key host transcription factors, premature termination of HIV-1 RNAs, and abnormal splicing patterns. To differentiate among these mechanisms, we isolated extremely pure populations of resting CD4+ T cells from patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy. These cells did not produce virus but retained the capacity to do so if appropriately stimulated. Products of HIV-1 transcription were examined in purified resting CD4+ T cells. Although short, prematurely terminated HIV-1 transcripts have been suggested as a marker for latently infected cells, the production of short transcripts had not been previously demonstrated in purified populations of resting CD4+ T cells. By separating RNA into polyadenylated and nonpolyadenylated fractions, we showed that resting CD4+ T cells from patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy produce abortive transcripts that lack a poly(A) tail and that terminate prior to nucleotide 181. Short transcripts dominated the pool of total HIV-1 transcripts in resting CD4+ T cells. Processive, polyadenylated HIV-1 mRNAs were also present at a low level. Both unspliced and multiply spliced forms were found. Taken together, these results show that the nonproductive nature of the infection in resting CD4+ T cells from patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy is not due to absolute blocks at the level of either transcriptional initiation or elongation but rather relative inefficiencies at multiple steps."

Among these, individuals presenting with neurologic symptoms during follow-up were assessed for CSF/Plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance by measuring HIV-1 RNA in collected plasma and CSF samples. CSF/plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance was defined as either detectable CSF HIV-1 RNA (VL > 20 copies/mL) with an undetectable plasma RNA (complete viral suppression, VL ≤20 copies/mL) or CSF HIV-1 RNA ≥ 0.5 log10 higher than plasma RNA when plasma VL was between 20 and 1000 copies/mL (low-level viremia, LLV).Out of 1584 virologically suppressed patients, 71 (4.4%) presented with incident neurologic symptoms. Twenty out of 71 (28.2%) patients were diagnosed with CSF/Plasma HIV-1 discordance. Median plasma and CSF VL in patients with discordance was 120 [interquartile range (IQR): <20 to 332.5] and 4250 (IQR: 2550.0- 9615.0) copies/mL, respectively. All 9 individuals in which CSF HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing was done showed mutations that would compromise efficacy of prescribed ART regimen. Prevalence of CSF/plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance was higher among neurologically symptomatic patients with plasma LLV as compared with those with complete viral suppression (70% vs 11.8%, P < .001). The risk of discordance was also greater in patients who received protease inhibitor (PI) containing ART (P < .001) and those on ART regimens with central nervous system (CNS) penetration effectiveness (CPE) value <6 (P = .006).CSF/plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance indicates replication of HIV-1 that has adapted to the CNS or has developed antiretroviral drug resistance. Larger studies should be performed to study incidence of discordance in India. This will help in managing patients presenting with neurologic symptoms on suppressive ART with appropriate neuroeffective therapy."

From January to August 2009, we assessed the sexual behaviour of HIV-infected patients attending an HIV treatment centre in Uganda and analysed characteristics associated with HIV sero-discordance. Of the 278 respondents, 256 (92.1%) were female, 218 (78.1%) were on antiretroviral drugs and 107 (38.7%) belonged to a sero-discordant couple. In the prior 3 months, 238 (88.5%) had more than one sexual partner and 98 (35.8%) had acquired new sexual partners. Only 171 (61.5%) had ever disclosed sero-status to main sexual partners. Participants who had changed sexual partners in the previous 3 months were more likely to be sero-discordant (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.13, 3.11). Respondents who used condoms during their last sexual intercourse and those currently on ARVs were significantly less likely to be sero-discordant (OR 0.52 95% CI 0.28, 0.96 and OR 0.52 95% CI 0.30, 0.94, respectively). Only disclosure of sero-status was independently though inversely associated with discordance (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20, 0.64). Our findings indicate that HIV patients continue exhibiting high risk behaviour characterised by changing sexual partners, having multiple sexual partners and non-use of condoms."

All patients included in the cohort had an optimal adherence at inclusion, evaluated by the level of viral load and a questionnaire. Among the 133 patients included in the cohort, 115 patients were still followed one year later. Potential risk factors analysed in the study were: side effects, social support, level of stress, stress adaptation, strategies of coping and quality of life. The stress-coping model developed by Lazarus-Folkman (1984) was used to analyse pathways by which variables could influence level of adherence. Results showed that patients who stayed adherent during the follow-up reported less side effects, had a lower level of stress than patient who became non-adherent over time. They used more frequently active strategies of coping (positive reappraisal) and had a higher score of quality of life. Results from logistic regression showed variables associated with adherence at one year were strategies of positive reappraisal (OR = 1.08; 95% CI: 1.02-1.15) and a high score of physical health status (OR = 1.85; 95% CI: 0.99-3.49). The score of mental health status at inclusion was a predictive factor of adherence one year later, a lower score being predictive of a non-optimal level of adherence (OR = 1.05; 95% CI 1.002-1.09). For reinforcing adherent behaviours, interventions focused on the learning of active strategies of coping should be developed. The measure of quality of life should also become a standard measure of patients' surveillance, as biological parameters are."

Out of the 56 consecutively collected eligible specimens, 51 were tested using the ViroSeq RT-PCR method (Abbott Germany) to obtain 47 consecutive sequences for the HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) region. As per the 2009 WHO list of mutations for surveillance of transmitted HIVDR, only one nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation was detected at K101E from all specimens tested, suggesting a low prevalence (<5%) of resistance to NNRTIs and no mutations were detected at other sites, suggesting a low prevalence (<5%) of resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI) drug classes as well.

This activity was 3.27 times more likely to have occurred with seropositive partners than with partners who were seronegative or whose serostatus was unknown. Fourteen men (2.3% of total sample) had engaged in unprotected insertive anal sex with 25 seronegative or unknown serostatus partners who were not informed of their risk of infection. Thirty-three men (5.4% of total sample) had engaged in this activity with 37 seropositive partners who were informed. Clinicians and other health professionals can play an important role in helping to control the HIV epidemic by discussing with seropositive patients the importance of using safer sex and informing sexual partners.

A nested case-control study was carried out to evaluate possible transmission mechanisms. The health care experience of each HIV-positive patient during that patient's PPI was compared to the experience of time-matched controls. Only invasive dental procedures were significantly associated with the risk of infection. Patients upon whom invasive dental procedures were performed during their PPIs had an average risk of HIV infection 8.15 times greater than comparable controls (P = 0.006), and seven out of nine cases of HIV infection with known PPIs in 1992 had an invasive dental procedure performed one to six months before seroconversion.

Surgeons are at risk of contracting these infections by a number of routes including splashes of blood on to the mucous membranes of eyes, nose and mouth, needle stick injuries and spillage of blood on chapped ungloved hands. The endoscopic surgeon is quite unaware of nearly all instances of facial contamination because the splashes are frequently both minute and dilute. Sodium fluorescein, an indelible fluorescent dye detectable in dilutions of one to two parts per million, has been used in this prospective study as a marker of irrigating fluid used during transurethral resection. In 17 out of 20 consecutive operations its presence on the face of the surgeon was revealed by photography, although only a few splashes were visible to the naked eye. There was a random distribution of splashes and also a recurring pattern of contamination of the orbit of the eye that looks through the telescope and the tip of the nose. Vaccination against hepatitis B is recommended for all endoscopic surgeons, together with the use of protective glasses and a mask that covers both the nose and mouth. The greatest danger to the health care team is from an infectious patient who is an unknown risk. It is recommended that high risk patients presenting for transurethral resection should first be screened for the presence of HBV, HCV and HIV antigens."

From October to November 1994, 426 FSWs were recruited. The method of anonymous and unlinked HIV screening recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) was used. The overall HIV seroprevalence was 58.2% (95% confidence interval: 53.4-62.9) and 52.6% of FSWs had at least one STD agent. The most common STDs were trichomoniasis (23%), syphilis (15%) and gonorrhoea (13%). In a logistic regression analysis, risk factors for HIV infection were high gravidity (> or = 2 pregnancies), low perception of personal risk of HIV infection, syphilis and the presence of genital warts. These results suggest that FSWs in Burkina Faso need better information about HIV transmission and prevention and then need better access to STD detection and management services."

We previously documented the accumulation of genetic alterations in a HBV-transfected cell line. In the present study, we addressed the effect of HBV and its replication on the genome and phenotype of the host cell. Parental HBV-free Hep G2 cells and two HBV-transfected variant lines Hep G2215 and Hep G2T14. 1, which do and do not replicate HBV, respectively, were used to monitor genetic alterations in conjunction with HBV profile in vitro and in vivo. Comparison of in vitro growth rates showed that Hep G2T14.1 cells grew more rapidly, while Hep G2215 cells, replicating HBV, grew slower than parental Hep G2 cells. Molecular analysis confirmed an HBV integration site (s) in both variants, and reverse trancriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification documented expression of transcript for the HBX protein, which has recently been implicated in the compromised efficiency of cellular DNA repair. Tumorigenisity testing indicate a comparable rate of tumor formation in nude mice of both HBV-transfected variants, giving rise to tumors in 3 weeks; parental Hep G2 cells did not form tumors in nude mice. Tumor tissue from nude mice injected with Hep G2T14.1 cells showed no change in HBV status. However, a new HBV integration site was detected in tumor tissue from Hep G2215-injected mice. Two cell lines derived from the respective tumor tissue grew in vitro at rates compatible to those observe before passage in nude mice. The Hep G2215 tumor-derived line continued to replicate HBV, while HBV status remained unchanged in the Hep G2T14.1 tumor-derived line. Unique genetic alterations were detected in both transfected cell lines, and Hep G2215 cells particularly showed cellular mosaicism and clonal selection when analyzed after the passage in nude mice. Further genetic alterations were detected in tumor-derived cell lines. Interestingly, the de novo genetic alterations in the Hep G2215 cells, which maintain the ability to replicate HBV, included a new HBV integration site, several chromosome rearrangements and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of one p53 allele. Western analyses of p21/Waf1 protein indicate an upregulation of the protein in cells that replicate HBV. Based on the combined data, we hypothesize that the genetic alterations in the cellular genome could also be generated as a function in the presence of HBV and HBV replication. Possible mechanisms that could be implicated in cumulative mutagenetic events are discussed."

Fifty HIV-1-suppressed patients on stable once-daily nevirapine plus emtricitabine/tenofovir-DF were switched to single-tablet rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir-DF. Lifestyle, weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), ≥6 h overnight fasting lipids, 10-year Framingham risk scores (FRS), and Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III) lipid goals were evaluated over 48 weeks. Patients were 82% males, were a median of 45 years of age, and were on nevirapine for a median of 66 months. Diets, exercise levels, body mass index, and smoking status did not change during follow-up. At week 24, significant changes (p<0.001) were seen in mean [95% confidence interval (CI)] total cholesterol (-0.67 mmol/liter, CI: -0.50 to -0.83), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.36, CI: -0.21 to -0.51), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.28, CI: -0.20 to -0.35).

HIV and HCV antibody (HCVAb) prevalences in injection drug users were 29 and 49%, respectively. Of the HCVAb-seroreactive IDUs, 33% had HIV as well. HIV prevalence in young IDUs (≤19 years), estimated as surrogate for HIV incidence, was high at 12% and HCVAb in this subgroup was 27%. Herpes simplex virus 2 antibody (IgG) was detected in 10% of IDUs; 2% had syphilis. Alcohol use prevalence was high and frequency of use concerning. In multivariate analyses, 'city of residence closer to international border' and '>1 year duration of injecting drugs were associated with HIV and HCVAb. Furthermore, 'irregular supply of syringes and needles' was associated with HCVAb seroreactive status of IDUs (adjusted odds ratio 1.7; 95% CI 1.3-2.3;P < 0.001), and 'any genital disease symptom within the last year' (adjusted odds ratio 2; 95% CI 1.4-2.9;P < 0.001) was associated with HIV infection.

A HCV-positive serostatus was associated with the IVDU transmission route, non-African ethnicity, elevated liver parameters (ASL or GGT) and low HIV viral load. Replicative HBV infection and HCV-positive serostatus both correlated with HIV resistance mutations (P = 0.001 and P = 0.028). HBV and HCV infection are frequent co-infections in HIV treatment-naive patients. These co-infections influence viral evolution, clinical parameters and serological markers. Consequently, HIV patients should routinely be tested for HBV and HCV infection before initiating HIV treatment. OHBV infection constituted almost half of all HBV infections with detectable HBV DNA. Due to a lack of risk factors indicating OHBV infection, HBV diagnosis should not only include serological markers but also the detection of HBV DNA."

The clinical syndrome was characterized by fever (all cases), generalized lymphadenopathy (11), arthralgias and myalgias (9), sore throat (9), rash (7), splenomegaly (6), and other less frequent signs and symptoms. All patients had a spontaneous resolution of their symptoms within 5-30 days. Anti-HIV-1 serum antibodies, as measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) at the onset of clinical illness, were negative in every patient. HIV antigen (p24), on the contrary, was detectable in nine cases. Western blot IgM and IgG analysis was serially performed: IgMs were positive in nine cases and IgGs in three. The CD4+/CD8+ ratio was low in all patients because CD8+ were remarkably increased and CD4+ slightly reduced. A laterocervical lymph nodes biopsy was performed in four patients. The morphological and immunohistological pattern of the acute HIV-1-related lymphadenopathy did not correspond to any of the typical ones. The envelope virus protein gp120/160 was found in interfollicular and follicular lymphocytes, in endothelial cells, and in interdigitating and dendritic reticulum cells. The p17 and p24 core virus proteins were mainly detected in endothelial, interdigitating, and dendritic reticulum cells, but in only a few lymphocytes. The follow-up suggests a rapid evolution to ARC and AIDS in patients showing an acute symptomatic HIV infection."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of HBcAg in HBeAg-negative CHB. One hundred six HBeAg-negative CHB patients who underwent ultrasonographically guided liver biopsy were reviewed for their HBV DNA load and clinical and histological data. Factors associated with the expression of intrahepatic HBcAg were analyzed. Among the patients, 35 (33%) were positive for HBcAg by immunohistostaining. In patients whose HBV DNA loads were higher than 10(7) copies (cp)/ml, nearly one-half (52%) had detectable HBcAg. Compared with HBcAg-negative patients, HBcAg-positive patients had higher serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and HBV DNA levels and more-severe hepatic necroinflammation. High serum ALT level (>160 U/liter) and HBV viral load were the determinants of HBcAg expression in multivariate analysis. Large amounts of HBcAg expression were frequently detected in patients with high DNA loads, and the patterns of HBcAg distribution were not related to histological activity or HBV DNA levels. In patients with lower HBV DNA loads, the expression of HBcAg was the key factor associated with active hepatic necroinflammation (hazard ratio = 11.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.42 to 89.26; P = 0.022). In conclusion, the expression of HBcAg is not frequent in HBeAg-negative CHB. The expression of intrahepatic HBcAg indicates active hepatic necroinflammation, even in patients with low HBV DNA load. Both HBV viral load and HBcAg expression have implications in the pathogenesis of HBeAg-negative CHB."

Of these patients, 55 were coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The genotype was related to viral load and the co-existence of HIV infection. Likewise, the relationship between these parameters and the presence of the HCV core antigen was established. The results indicate that genotype 1b was the most prevalent (38.4%) followed by genotype 3a (23.1%). Patients coinfected with HIV presented fewer infections due to group 1 genotypes (p < 0.05).Patients with HIV presented a greater viral load in all the genotypes, with genotype 3 presenting a high viral load. Detection of the HCV core antigen showed a close correlation with viral load determinations. Although not yet sufficiently assessed, determination of the HCV core antigen constitutes a simple technique that could eventually contribute to improving the management of patients with chronic HCV hepatitis."

We sought to elucidate the interplay between two relevant factors (IL28B polymorphism and T cell immune responses) involved in the outcome of this therapy in HCV-infected patients. We evaluated 38 patients infected with HCV genotype 1-17 coinfected with HIV-who were undergoing a full course of pegIFNα/RBV therapy. The interdependence and roles of T cell-mediated immune responses and IL28B rs12979860 single-nucleotide polymorphism genotype as predictors of virological response to anti-HCV treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C were evaluated using nonparametric tests. Factors associated with rapid virological response (RVR) in univariate analysis were presence of CD4 T cell response against NS3 HCV protein, low baseline HCV-RNA, and IL28B CC genotype. Factors associated with sustained virological response (SVR) in univariate analysis were IL28B CC genotype, low baseline HCV-RNA, and presence of CD4 response against NS2. In the multivariate analysis, low baseline HCV-RNA and NS3-specific CD4 response showed a clear trend toward association with RVR (P = 0.09 and P = 0.07, respectively). Regarding SVR, IL28B CC genotype was the strongest predictor (P = 0.02), with presence of NS2-specific CD4 response showing a clear trend (P = 0.09). HCV-specific T cell response influences the outcome of pegIFNα/RBV therapy regardless of IL28B genotype. HCV-specific T cell responses (adaptive immunity) seem to influence viral clearance both in the short and long term during therapy (RVR and SVR), whereas the influence of the IL28B genotype (innate immunity) may be more relevant to the long-lasting therapeutic effect (SVR)."

HBsAg quantification was evaluated using both assays in 126 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-coinfected patients initiating treatment with tenofovir dipivoxil fumarate. Linear regression and correlation were used to establish the relationship between the two methods. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to determine mean between-assay difference and limits of agreement (LOA) (±2 standard deviations [SD]) both overall and stratified on HBV (hepatitis B envelope antigen [HBeAg] status, replication, genotype, HBV mutants) or HIV (CD4(+) cell count) cofactors. There was a significant correlation between Elecsys and Architect assays (correlation coefficient, r = 0.959; P < 0.001). HBsAg quantification using the Elecsys assay was on average 0.200 log(10) IU/ml (LOA, -0.500, 0.800) higher than that using Architect, which was consistent across levels of CD4(+) cell count, presence of precore and YMDD mutations, and HBeAg status. A slightly larger mean between-assay difference was observed with genotypes A and G (0.196 and 0.201, respectively) versus HBV genotypes D and E (0.036 and 0.030, respectively). Mutations on the S region at position s120/s145 were the only determinant in which the mean between-assay difference in HBsAg quantification was lower than the null value (-0.078). In conclusion, the Elecsys assay, with automatic on-board dilution, is capable of quantifying serum HBsAg levels in HIV-HBV-coinfected patients, with very high correlation with the Architect assay."

Infection by this virus is thought to be associated with blood borne hepatitis. In this study, the presence of HCV- and HGV-RNAs in serum or plasma (175 patients) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (133 patients) was investigated in patients with clotting disorders using a sensitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). HGV-RNA was detected in serum of 26 patients (14.8%). In apparently healthy blood donors, serum HGV-RNA was detected in 4 of 358 individuals investigated (1.12%). Ninety two percent of the 26 serum HGV-RNA positive patients had coinfection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), especially with HCV genotype 1b, the most common genotype in Belgium. Of these coinfected patients, 15 (62.5%) showed elevated serum ALT levels. Two patients who were solely infected with HGV had normal serum ALT.HGV-RNA in PBMC was found in 18 patients, of whom 3 were negative for serum HGV-RNA. As in case of HCV, HGV-RNA in PBMC is preferentially sensitive to interferon treatment. Nevertheless, rapid reappearance of HGV-RNA in PBMC was observed after cessation of treatment. In one patient, persistent serum ALT elevation seems to be associated with continued HGV viremia, despite the disappearance of serum HCV-RNA."

A number of studies have suggested that induction of the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 3 (APOBEC3) and bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST-2/tetherin/CD317) retroviral restriction factors underlies the IFN-α-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication in vitro. We sought to characterize the as-yet-undefined relationship between IFN-α treatment, retroviral restriction factors, and HIV-1 in vivo. APOBEC3G, APOBEC3F, and BST-2 expression levels were measured in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected, antiretroviral therapy-naïve individuals before, during, and after pegylated IFN-α/ribavirin (IFN-α/riba) combination therapy. IFN-α/riba therapy decreased HIV-1 viral load by -0.921 (±0.858) log(10) copies/mL in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. APOBEC3G/3F and BST-2 mRNA expression was significantly elevated during IFN-α/riba treatment in patient-derived CD4+ T cells (P < 0.04 and P < 0.008, paired Wilcoxon), and extent of BST-2 induction was correlated with reduction in HIV-1 viral load during treatment (P < 0.05, Pearson's r). APOBEC3 induction during treatment was correlated with degree of viral hypermutation (P < 0.03, Spearman's ρ), and evolution of the HIV-1 accessory protein viral protein U (Vpu) during IFN-α/riba treatment was suggestive of increased BST-2-mediated selection pressure. These data suggest that host restriction factors play a critical role in the antiretroviral capacity of IFN-α in vivo, and warrant investigation into therapeutic strategies that specifically enhance the expression of these intrinsic immune factors in HIV-1-infected individuals."

We analyzed the presence of HLA-B*57:01 allele in 1646 HIV-1 infected patients from different regions of Argentina. This allele was detected in 81 patients; most of them corresponded to patients living in the central region of the country. The prevalence of HLA-B*57:01 was 4.9%, similar to other Caucasian populations and higher than other data reported for South American populations. This strongly supports screening for the presence of HLA-B*57:01 in abacavir treatment of HIV-1 in our country. "

The mammary gland represents a unique environment for HIV-1 replication and host-virus interplay. We aimed to explore the origin of the virus transmitted during breastfeeding, and the link with quasi-species found in acellular and cellular fractions of breast-milk (BM) and in maternal plasma. The C2-V5 region of the env gene was amplified, cloned and sequenced from the RNA and DNA of BM, the RNA from the mother's plasma (PLA) and the DNA from infant's dried blood spot (DBS) in 11 post-natal mother-infant pairs. Sequences were assembled in Geneious, aligned in ClustalX, manually edited in SeAL and phylogenetic reconstruction was undertaken in PhyML and MrBayes. We estimated the timing of transmission (ETT) and reconstructed the time for the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the infant in BEAST. Transmission of single quasi-species was observed in 9 of 11 cases. Phylogenetic analysis illustrated a BM transmission event by cell-free virus in 4 cases, and by cell-associated virus in 2 cases but could not be identified in the remaining 5 cases. Molecular clock estimates, of the infant ETT and TMRCA, corresponded well with the timing of transmission estimated by sequential infant DNA PCR in 10 of 11 children. The TMRCA of BM variants were estimated to emerge during gestation in 8 cases. We hypothesize that in the remaining cases, the breast was seeded with a long-lived lineage latently infecting resting T-cells. Our analysis illustrated the role of DNA and RNA virus in MTCT. We postulate that DNA archived viruses stem from latently infected quiescent T-cells within breast tissue and MTCT can be expected to continue, albeit at low levels, should interventions not effectively target these cells.

However, outcome data from HIV-infected patients who receive drug-eluting stents (DESs) are limited. We hypothesized that HIV-infected patients treated with DESs would have fewer recurrent cardiac events compared with those who receive bare metal stents (BMSs). We evaluated 97 HIV-infected patients and 97 non-HIV control patients who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention between January 2000 and July 2007. Clinical, laboratory, and angiographic data were obtained by chart review. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as clinically driven coronary revascularization, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death, were adjudicated by 2 independent physicians. The mean age of the HIV cohort was 53 years, and all patients were men. Compared with non-HIV patients, HIV-infected patients were less likely to have hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and previous coronary artery disease and were more likely to have been treated with longer stent length and more stents. During a mean follow-up of 3.1 years, patients who received a DES had a lower rate of MACE compared with those who had received a BMS, regardless of HIV status. After multivariate adjustment for baseline characteristic differences, non-HIV-DES patients had 65% fewer MACE and HIV-DES patients had 60% fewer MACE compared with non-HIV-BMS patients. In conclusion, these data suggest that treatment with DESs in the HIV population is safe and efficacious."

All the possible risk factors for HTLV-1 seropositivity among first-time blood donors were evaluated in Mashhad, Iran, during the period of 2011-2012. Blood donation volunteers were interviewed for demographic data, medical history, and behavioral characteristics and the frequencies of risk factors were compared between HTLV-1 positive (case) and HTLV-1 negative (control) donors. The data was analyzed using Chi square and t-tests. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for the infection. Assessments were carried out on 246 cases aged 17-60 and 776 controls aged 17-59, who were matched based on their ages, gender, and date and center of donation. Logistic analysis showed low income (OR = 1.53, p = 0.035), low educational level (OR = 1.64, p = 0.049), being born in the cities of either Mashhad (OR = 2.47, p = 0.001) or Neyshabour (OR = 4.30, p < 0001), and a history of blood transfusion (OR = 3.17, p = 0.007) or non-IV drug abuse (OR = 3.77, p < 0.0001) were significant predictors for infection with HTLV-1. Lack of variability or small sample size could be reasons of failure to detect some well-known risk factors for HTLV-1 infection, such as prolonged breastfeeding and sexual promiscuity. Pre-donation screening of possible risk factors for transfusion-transmissible infections should also be considered as an important issue, however, a revision of the screening criteria such as a history of transfusion for more than one year prior to donation is strongly recommended.

To describe the clinical, epidemiological, and histopathological aspects of HTLV-1/HCV coinfection in Brazil. A cross-sectional study with 23 patients coinfected with HCV/HTLV. The control groups consisted of 21 patients monoinfected with HCV and 20 patients monoinfected with HTLV-1. The cytokine profiles (Th1 and Th2 cell responses), clinical, laboratory features, and histopathological aspects were examined. The control group for cytokine analysis validation consisted of patients monoinfected with HTLV, and a fourth group consisted of healthy blood donors. No anthropometric differences present between the three infected groups. We observed higher serum concentrations of IFN-γ in patients coinfected with HCV/HTLV-1 than those in HCV monoinfected patients. The HCV/HTLV-1 coinfected group also exhibited a higher degree of liver steatosis than the HCV monoinfected patients. Results suggest that HCV/HTLV-1 coinfection may result in a different pattern of HCV infection due to the immunologic disorders likely associated with HTLV-1, but there is no clear evidence of the HTLV role in the natural history of HCV infection.

The study population consisted of 2729 atomic bomb survivors in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, who had no previous history of cancer at baseline. The baseline survey, including analysis of antibody to HTLV-1, took place during 1985-1987 and follow-up was performed until the end of 2001. There were 553 incident cases of malignant neoplasms during the observation period. After adjustment for sex, age and other variables, HTLV-1 infection was not associated with the risk of developing cancers of all sites, excluding adult T-cell leukemia (rate ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.4), stomach, colon and rectum, lung, female breast or other minor sites, but was associated with increased risk of liver cancer (rate ratio 2.1, 95%CI 1.0-4.6). The point estimate of the rate ratio for thyroid cancer was 3.0, but this was not significantly higher than 1 because of the small number of events (n = 11) and low prevalence of HTLV-1 seropositivity. These findings support the idea that HTLV-1 infection is not associated with an increased general cancer risk. Confounding by hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the interaction between HTLV-1 and HCV may explain the increased risk of liver cancer among HTLV-1 carriers. Further follow-up may be required to determine if HTLV-1 carriers are at increased risk of thyroid cancer."

Metabolic complications such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and fat distribution abnormalities are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is now a leading cause of death among HIV-infected patients. Lipid abnormalities, now often characteristically seen with HIV infection, include elevated triglycerides and low elevated total cholesterol (TC), and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels of total and HDL cholesterol. Many antiretroviral drugs are associated with lipid abnormalities, which commonly include hypertriglyceridemia and increased total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The management of dyslipidemia includes lifestyle modifications, lipid-lowering therapy, and switching antiretroviral therapy (ART). The increased prevalence of insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes is multifactorial in etiology. Management and goals of diabetes should follow the same practice guidelines in non-HIV-infected patients. Drug interactions and switching ART are additional management measures in diabetic HIV-infected patients. Since the treatment of lipodystrophy is a challenge, its prevention by selecting appropriate ART is the key."

Moreover, common mental health problems, if left undetected and untreated, may have severe consequences for adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), which in turn will likely lead to severe health consequences for patients. There are high costs associated with employing professional psychologists, counsellors, and social workers to provide psychosocial support to ART users. As a result, in many contexts lay counsellors and patient advocates have been employed as a less costly alternative. High standards of training of lay counsellors, as well as on-going supervision and support to patient advocates is necessary to ensure optimal outcomes/results."

This study investigated the association between education literacy to HIV treatment adherence and barriers to care among African Americans living with HIV/AIDS. A community-recruited sample of 85 African-American men and 53 women receiving HIV treatment completed measures of health literacy, health status, treatment adherence, emotional well-being, and barriers to care. Nearly one-third (29%) of the participants had < 12 years of education or were functionally illiterate, and those with low-education literacy were less likely to be adherent to HIV medications within the previous two days. Lower-education literacy also was related to reasons for missing medications and barriers to accessing medical care. Individuals of law-education literacy also were more emotionally distressed, lacked social support, and were less optimistic than those with higher education. These results indicate that education and health literacy are important factors in HIV-treatment adherence and access to medical care. Interventions are needed for improving treatment adherence among law-income minorities, and such interventions will need tailoring for individuals with limited reading ability."

In light of concerns about the possibly deleterious effect of psychoactive drug use on adherence to ART, we sought to determine the relationship between high-intensity cannabis use and adherence to ART among a community-recruited cohort of HIV-positive illicit drug users. We used data from the ACCESS study, an ongoing prospective cohort study of HIV-seropositive illicit drug users linked to comprehensive ART dispensation records in a setting of universal no-cost HIV care. We estimated the relationship between at least daily cannabis use in the last 6 months, measured longitudinally, and the likelihood of optimal adherence to ART during the same period, using a multivariate linear mixed-effects model accounting for relevant socio-demographic, behavioral, clinical and structural factors. From May 2005 to May 2012, 523 HIV-positive illicit drug users were recruited and contributed 2,430 interviews. At baseline, 121 (23.1 %) participants reported at least daily cannabis use. In bivariate and multivariate analyses we did not observe an association between using cannabis at least daily and optimal adherence to prescribed HAART (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 1.12, 95 % Confidence Interval [95 % CI]: 0.76-1.64, p value = 0.555.) High-intensity cannabis use was not associated with adherence to ART.

PCR was used to examine HCV RNA from serum and lesional and nonlesional cutaneous biopsy samples of HCV-infected patients. Seven patients with lichen planus (12.9%) and two patients in the control group (3.7%) were anti-HCV antibody positive. Five out of seven patients with anti-HCV antibodies had demonstrable HCV RNA in lesional skin biopsies. The viral RNA was absent in three out of four patients with lichen planus whose serum samples were positive for HCV RNA and agreed to biopsy of nonlesional skin.

Proteinuria was absent at 9 years of age when he presented with vertically transmitted HIV infection. Within a few months of HAART, the viral load became undetectable and CD4 count was normalised. Nephrotic range proteinuria, with preserved renal function, developed approximately 4 years later despite excellent HIV disease suppression. Renal biopsy showed non-collapsing focal segmental glomerular sclerosis changes compatible with HIVAN. Although the role of other unknown factors in the disease pathogenesis could not be totally excluded, this case demonstrates that HIVAN can still occur in HIV-infected children despite excellent HAART and that the disease manifestations and outcome may differ from those reported in previous studies."

Glomerular changes were typical of primary IgA nephropathy in four patients, and a mixed picture of IgA and membranous nephropathy was demonstrated in one patient. Immunofluorescence microscopy using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against HBsAg, HBcAg, and HBeAg revealed mesangial deposits of HBsAg in renal biopsies from four patients. One renal biopsy showed only mesangial and capillary HBcAg by polyclonal antiserum, and virus-like particles were demonstrated in the intramembranous electron-dense deposits on ultrastructural examination. Mesangial HBeAg was not detected in the renal biopsies from these patients with IgA nephropathy. As for the single patient with a mixed picture of IgA and membranous nephropathy, granular deposits of HBeAg with a distribution similar to IgG were detected in the glomerular capillary walls in addition to the mesangial deposition of HBsAg.

Hepatitis C virus NS3 antigen and hepatitis C virus RNA were detected in infiltrating cells but not within muscle fibres or endothelial cells. Our findings suggest that humoral-mediated immune mechanisms, not directly related to hepatitis C virus infection of muscle structures, may sustain the local inflammatory reaction in this patient."

The progression of hepatitis C is extremely variable and there is frequently a poor correlation among liver biochemistry, viral load and the stage of liver disease. Liver biopsy remains the only definitive way of staging fibrosis and grading necroinflammatory activity. Concerns have been expressed about the safety of the procedure; however, with modern regimes for the correction of coagulopathy in patients with inherited bleeding disorders, normal haemostasis may be maintained during the peribiopsy period. We performed 21 liver biopsies between 1984 and 1997 on patients with factor VIII (FVIII) or IX (FIX) deficiency and von Willebrand's Disease (VWD). Four had concomitant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, five were thrombocytopenic and one had a prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Haemostasis was achieved using an intermittent bolus of factor concentrate or continuous infusion regimens. One patient with VWD received Desmopressin (DDAVP). There were no bleeding episodes associated with biopsy. We suggest that liver biopsy is a safe procedure in patients with inherited bleeding disorders when the coagulopathy is fully corrected. It is the only definitive method of staging the extent of fibrosis associated with hepatitis C infection, and it is this that defines prognosis."

The cause of this destruction may be an increase in periodontal disease activity at sites within the same individual and also may be related to an increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines, diffused through the gingival crevicular sulcus in AIDS patients. A study was undertaken to determine the relative levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), in gingival crevicular fluid collected from the deep (> 5 mm periodontal pocket depth) and shallow (< or = 3 mm periodontal pocket depth) periodontal pockets of 39 HIV-1-infected patients and 20 age-, race- and sex-matched uninfected controls. Complete medical history including risk factors such as intravenous drug abuse was taken. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected on periopaper strips. Cytokines were estimated by solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To assess the degree of HIV activity, the viral load of these patients was determined by an Amplicor HIV-1 monitor kit using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Gingival crevicular fluid from HIV-1-infected patients showed a two-fold increase in both IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in deep periodontal pockets in comparison to shallow pockets, whereas IL-6 increased 1.8-fold. There was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in gingival crevicular fluid (both shallow and deep pockets) from HIV-1-infected patients in comparison to uninfected controls and also significantly elevated in deep versus shallow pockets in these patients. Although IL-1 beta, L-6 and TNF-alpha levels among HIV-1-infected patients with a high viral load (> 10,000 copies/ml) were higher than those from patients with a low viral load (< 400 copies/ml), only the increase in IL-1 beta level associated with deep pockets was significant (P < 0.05). There was also a trend of an increase in all the three cytokines among intravenous drug-abusing HIV-1-infected patients in comparison to non-intravenous drug abusers, but only the difference in IL-1 beta levels from deep pockets reached significance (P < 0.05). These enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the gingival crevicular fluid of HIV-positive patients may be an important factor in causing the advanced periodontal lesions sometimes observed in HIV-positive patients."

Cross-sectional surveys of drug users attending treatment centers on the island of Funen with approximately 500,000 inhabitants were administered in 1996 and 2007. The 2007 prevalence estimates were: anti-HBc 50.2%, HBsAg 0.9%, anti-HCV 66.8%, HCV-RNA 40%, and anti-HIV 1.1%. The corresponding 1996 prevalence values were: anti-HBc 70% (P < 0.0001), HBsAg 9.8% (P < 0.0001), anti-HCV 82.8% (P < 0.0001), HCV-RNA 56.3% (P = 0.002), and anti-HIV 1% (P = 1). The 2007 prevalence of viral hepatitis decreased due to the increasing proportion of non-injectors. Among injectors, the prevalence remained unchanged except for a significant decrease in HBsAg. The 2007 prevalence of ongoing HBV infection among infected (HBsAg/anti-HBc proportion) was the lowest that to our knowledge has been reported among drug-users. Vaccination coverage among susceptible persons tested in 2007 was 24%, compared to 0.7% in 1996. Therefore, despite an unchanged prevalence of anti-HBc among injecting drug users, a highly significant drop in HBsAg prevalence was seen during the last decade. This observation may be linked causally to an increase in hepatitis B vaccination of the susceptible population. Our findings suggest that even incomplete vaccination, without persistent protective anti-HBs levels, may induce an immune memory sufficient to prevent chronic infection upon transmission."

No subject had a history of commercial sex work, injection drugs use or blood transfusion within the past 8 years. The majority of women belonged to the low socioeconomic stratum. HIV-1 antibody was found in the sera of 38 women (11.8%). HIV-1 seropositivity was not associated with any type of current sexually transmitted disease such as genital ulcers, serologic markers of syphilis or other sexually transmitted disease as well as history of past sexually transmitted disease within the past 2 years. Significant differential factors were found between the HIV-1 seropositive and seronegative women for self risk assessment and ability to communicate concerns with the husband or partner regarding HIV infection/AIDS. Programs are urgently needed for HIV/AIDS prevention and control to low-income communities and to determine what factors enable the HIV-1 seronegative women to be more assertive in their relationship and whether these skills can be enhanced to eliminate future episodes of STD and transfer these skills to the more vulnerable low-income women. Early diagnosis and prevention of HIV infection among women is a priority for public health interventions both in industrialized and in developing countries."

This retrospective study was conducted to document the incidence, prevalence, and clinical correlates of ""failure to thrive"" in a cohort of 97 HIV-infected children seen at a large urban teaching hospital over an 8-year period. ""Failure to thrive"" was defined as percent of body weight for height age < or = 90%. The cumulative incidence of failure to thrive in our cohort was 37/97 (38%), with a current prevalence of 13/97 (14%). When 33 patients with severe symptomatic HIV infection [Centers for Disease Control (CDC) class C] were analyzed separately, the cumulative incidence rose to 22/33 (67%) and current prevalence to 9/33 (27%). CDC class C correlated with failure to thrive (p < 0.001), as did absolute CD4 cell count more than two standard deviations below the mean for age (p < 0.001). Neither the mode of acquisition of HIV infection nor the presence of HIV antigenemia correlated with failure to thrive. During follow-up, 34/37 patients with failure to thrive gained weight; in 17 this was associated with specific nutritional therapy. Treatment with zidovudine (AZT) was also associated with a significant weight gain (p < 0.01). The incidence and prevalence of failure to thrive in our cohort are lower than in previous reports. We conclude that enrollment of HIV-infected children in a comprehensive clinic providing nutritional evaluation, supplemental feeding, treatment of opportunistic infections, antiretroviral medications, and psychosocial support will likely continue to reduce the incidence and prevalence of ""failure to thrive."""

The prevalence of primary resistance and the occurrence of recent infections among individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were identified among recently diagnosed patients at five sexually transmitted disease/AIDS testing and counselling centres in the metropolitan region of Recife (RMR), Pernambuco, Brazil, between 2007-2009. One-hundred and eight samples were analysed using the Calypte® BED assay. Males predominated (56%), as did patients aged 31-50 years. Twenty-three percent presented evidence of a recent HIV infection. The median CD4+ T lymphocyte count was 408 cells/mm³ and the median viral load was 3.683 copies/mL. The prevalence of primary resistance was 4.6% (confidence interval 95% = 1-8.2%) based on criteria that excluded common polymorphisms in accordance with the surveillance drug resistance mutation criteria. The prevalence of resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase, nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors were 3.8%, 1.5% and 0.8%, respectively. Fifty-seven percent of strains were from clade B, 37.7% were clade F and 3.1% were clade C; there were no statistically significant differences with respect to resistance between clades. Recent infection tended to be more common in men (p = 0.06) and in municipalities in the south of the RMR (Jaboatão dos Guararapes and Cabo de Santo Agostinho) (p = 0.046). The high prevalence of recent infection and the high prevalence of non-B strains in this poor Brazilian region merit further attention."

The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of HIV/AIDS patient hospitalizations between 1997 and 2012. This cross-sectional study used a hospital database that centralizes records of admissions in 31 hospitals, both public and private, across 26 municipalities in the interior of São Paulo. In order to verify associations between the variables, we used the prevalence ratio (PR) and a 95% confidence interval. Among 9,797 adults and children, 10,696 admissions were registered, which was equal to 1.09 admissions per patient. Most (62%) of the patients were male, and the predominant age group was 21 and 50 years (63.5%). Mortality was higher among male patients from all age groups (PR= 1.42 [95% CI: 1.28-1.57]; p < 0.05). The main cause of hospitalization (54.5% of the total) was infectious disease, whether opportunistic or not. This was true, even in the post-HAART era. Furthermore, gender and age differences were noted in patient mortality rates. "

The children were divided into three groups: group 1 included eight asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic children, group 2 nine moderately symptomatic children, and group 3 eight children with severe clinical manifestations. Group 1 children were without antiretroviral therapy; the remaining children received zidovudine (AZT) treatment. Only one group 3 patient had primary adrenal insufficiency. No significant differences in cortisol and ACTH secretion were found either between all HIV-1-infected and 126 age- and sex-matched normal children or among the three groups of patients. Mean CD4 cell count of each group declined in parallel to disease progression. No correlations were found between cortisol or ACTH values and CD4 cell count. Adrenal failure may be a late complication of HIV-1 infection and should be searched for in severely ill patients. Our data argue against the hypothesis of a cortisol-induced shift from T-helper-1 (Th1) to Th2 cytokine production profile as the pathogenetic mechanism of progression to AIDS."

Serum samples from 125 thalassemia patients, 300 intravenous drug users, 420 hemodialysis patients, 263 individuals with STDs, 47 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected homosexual men, and 316 healthy volunteers were tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) antibodies to HEV (anti-HEV) by enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) following a predetermined algorithm (Abbott Labs). Anti-HEV IgG was confirmed in 3/125 (2.4%) thalassemia patients, 5/300 (1.7%) intravenous drug users, 27/420 (6.4%) hemodialysis patients, 4/263 (1.5%) STD patients, 1/47 (2.1%) homosexual men, and 7/316 (2.2%) of the reference group. No patient was found positive for anti-HEV IgM. The higher prevalence which was observed in hemodialysis group was due to the confounding effect of age, as multivariate analysis showed. The anti-HEV prevalence increased significantly with age (p = 10(-4)). No significant association was found between anti-HEV, anti-HCV, and anti-HBc. In conclusion, individuals at high risk of non-A, non-B hepatitis and STDs have no increased risk of exposure to HEV and the higher prevalence of anti-HEV IgG among older subjects may be due to an epidemic form of HEV infection which occurred some decades ago, when the sanitary conditions in our country were poor."

Rosiglitazone did not increase subcutaneous fat in patients with HAART-associated lipodystrophy (HAL) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, although it attenuated insulin resistance and decreased liver fat content. The aim of this study was to examine effects of rosiglitazone on gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue in 30 patients with HAL. The mRNA concentrations in subcutaneous adipose tissue were measured using real-time PCR. Twenty-four-week treatment with rosiglitazone (8 mg/day) compared with placebo significantly increased the expression of adiponectin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), and PPARgamma coactivator 1 and decreased IL-6 expression. Expression of other genes involved in lipogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, or glucose transport, such as acyl-CoA synthase, adipocyte lipid-binding protein, CD45, fatty acid transport protein-1 and -4, GLUT1, GLUT4, keratinocyte lipid-binding protein, lipoprotein lipase, PPARdelta, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, remained unchanged. Rosiglitazone also significantly increased serum adiponectin concentration. The change in serum adiponectin concentration was inversely correlated with the change in fasting serum insulin concentration and liver fat content. In conclusion, rosiglitazone induced significant changes in gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue and ameliorated insulin resistance in patients with HAL. Increased expression of adiponectin might have mediated most of the favorable insulin-sensitizing effects of rosiglitazone in these patients."

To determine if this cytokine also predicts treatment response in HIV-1-infected children, a longitudinal study was performed over 48 weeks in 36 treatment-naïve children vertically infected with HIV-1. Subjects who received treatment (n = 29) were stratified as complete virological responders (n = 12), partial virological responders (n = 11), or non-responders (n = 6), based on decline in viral load from baseline to week 48. Median plasma IL-7 levels at baseline were higher in complete responders (4.85 pg/mL, interquartile range [IQR] = 3.35-6.5) than in untreated controls (2.10 pg/mL, IQR = 1.50-3.50; p = 0.05). Linear regression analysis showed that baseline IL-7 levels were positively correlated with changes in HIV-1 viral load between baseline and week 24 (r = 0.40; p = 0.03) and between baseline and week 48 (r = 0.34; p = 0.07), but not with corresponding changes in CD4+ T-cell percentages and absolute counts. Collectively, these results indicate that IL-7 levels at baseline are predictive of virological but not immunological response to ART in children infected with HIV-1."

In this 48-week, open-label, randomized, non-inferiority study, 262 HIV-1-infected adult patients with a viral load <50 copies/mL on protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens were switched to either once-daily efavirenz, lamivudine and enteric-coated didanosine (efavirenz-A [QD]) or once-daily efavirenz plus continuation of current nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (efavirenz-B). In the primary outcome of patients who maintained virological suppression at week 48, efavirenz-A (QD) was non-inferior to efavirenz-B (81% versus 79%, respectively). Both regimens were associated with low virological failure rates and significant improvements in treatment satisfaction, adherence and QoL after switching from PI-based therapy, with no differences between regimens. Switching from a PI- to an efavirenz-based regimen was generally safe and well tolerated."

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with T cell abnormalities and alters effector T cell function. There are a large number of patients coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Here, we evaluated the proportion of CD4(+) Treg cells expressing CD25 and FOXP3, and the status of immune activation of CD8(+) T cells in 60 Chinese patients chronically infected with HIV and/or HCV. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the level of Treg cells and immune activated CD8(+) T cells. We observed that the Treg level was upregulated in HIV infection and HCV infection could not enhance this kind of upregulation significantly. The level of Treg cells was negatively correlated with CD4(+) T cell counts and positively correlated with HIV viral loads. We observed considerably elevated CD38 and HLA-DR expression in CD8(+) T cells in HIV-infected subjects but not in HCV-infected patients in comparison to that in healthy controls. There is no significant difference concerning the proportion of CD8(+) T cells expressing CD38 or HLA-DR between HIV-1-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. After 12-week HAART, the proportion of Treg cells dropped, but still more than the level in healthy controls. HAART could reverse the abnormal immune activation of CD8(+) T cells. The decrease of Tregs did not alter the downregulation of HIV-1-specific CTL responses in these HIV-infected patients after HAART therapy. The level of HIV virus might be the key point for the decline of CTL responses."

Sequential serological studies were performed in a cohort of 100 homosexual men and 70 matched healthy controls over a mean period of 4 years. Of the patients, 18 were found to be HIV+ on admission to the study and 15 seroconverted to HIV+ during the follow up (seroconversion group). Serum antibodies of both IgG and IgA isotypes against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were determined. IgG antibodies indicate past infection, while a marked increase in IgG titre or a positive IgA titre were taken to indicate active infection or reactivated latent infection. EBV and CMV infections were about two to four times more prevalent in the homosexual men both HIV- and HIV+, compared with controls. Active infections were increased in the homosexual men and particularly in the HIV+ patients. The seroconversion group revealed activation of both EBV and CMV following HIV infection. When the antibody profile of seroconverting patients at the time preceding seroconversion was compared with a matched group of 39 homosexual men who remained HIV-, no change was found in CMV antibodies, but four out of 15 (26.6%) of the patients had high titres of anti-EBV IgA preceding seroconversion, as compared with only one out of 39 (2.6%) of HIV- homosexual men (P less than 0.05). This suggests a role for EBV reactivation in the pathogenesis of HIV infection in some patients."

We assessed progression of coronary artery calcium (CAC) in patients with HIV infection to identify factors that may help explain progression of atherosclerosis. Prospective, observational study of 132 HIV-infected men receiving chronic antiretroviral therapy (ART); we measured traditional atherosclerosis risk factors and assessed progression of CAC on sequential 64-slice CT scans at an average interval of 11 months (range 6-36). CAC score progression was defined as absolute and percentage change from baseline. During follow-up 45 patients (34%) showed absolute progression of CAC and 34 of them showed >15% yearly progression, a threshold previously associated with a high risk of myocardial infarction. Age, LDL cholesterol, visceral abdominal fat and current T-helper (CD4+) cell count were significantly associated with absolute CAC progression. Progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in HIV patients is associated with traditional coronary risk factors as well as HIV related factors such as the CD4+ cell count. Therefore, immunologic perturbations secondary to HIV infection may contribute to atherosclerosis progression."

Risk factors for zoster and trends in incidence in HIV-infected hemophiliacs and homosexual men (n=1218) were examined. From 1984 to 1997, 174 zoster cases were identified (average yearly incidence, 2.5%). Prior zoster episodes were associated with increased risk for a subsequent episode (relative risk [RR], 4.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.11-5.95). Among hemophiliacs, children and adolescents had the highest zoster risk, and zoster risk declined with age (RR, 0.80 per decade; 95% CI, 0.68-0.93). These findings suggest that HIV-infected persons do not produce or maintain adequate booster responses after varicella zoster virus exposure. Zoster risk was relatively constant when CD4 cell counts >200 cells/mm3 but increased steeply below this level. During the 14 years of follow-up, zoster incidence declined 9% per year. This trend occurred despite decreasing CD4 cell counts and was unexplained by zidovudine or acyclovir use."

In this single-arm study, we evaluated the effects of 8 weeks of sevelamer therapy on 36 HIV-infected subjects who were not receiving antiretroviral therapy. Sevelamer did not significantly change markers of microbial translocation, inflammation, or T-cell activation. During sevelamer treatment, however, levels of soluble tissue factor, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and oxidized LDL cholesterol decreased significantly, whereas D-dimer levels increased.

We examined the quantities of CIK cells and the changes of these cell expressing NK cell receptors in HIV-1-positive children infected via mother-to-child transmission. The percentage of CIK cells was quantified and the changes in the surface cell receptor profiles in 18 HIV-1-infected children were examined. We found that CIK cell percentages were dramatically increased in HIV-1-infected children. Furthermore, the expressions of CD16, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, NKp80 and CD244 on CIK cells were decreased, while the expressions of KIR3DL1 and NKG2D on CIK cells were increased in HIV-1-infected children. However, the expressions of KIR2D and NTB-A on CIK cells did not change in the HIV-1-infected children. CIK cells possessed the characteristics of promoting the maturation of dendritic cells and killing functions in HIV-1-infected children. Moreover, serum concentrations of IL-4 and IFN-γ were significantly increased in HIV-1-infected children compared with the HIV-negative controls. These changes likely occurred as a protective mechanism against transmission of maternal HIV-1 virus and thereby helped to limit viral spread, eliminate infected cells and help HIV-1-infected patients to slow the progression to AIDS."

The analysis included 1,192 respondents to the HIV Cost and Service Utilization Study (HCSUS) who were taking HAART. Self-reported past-week HAART adherence, antidepressant use, current mental health status, and an aggregate measure of regimen complexity were used in the analysis. Regression models with interactions between antidepressant treatment of mental health problems, poor emotional well-being or depressive symptoms, and medication complexity were estimated to assess differential associations with adherence. Irrespective of antidepressant treatment, poor mental health status was negatively associated with HAART medication adherence. However, only untreated higher depressive symptoms were strongly associated with maladherence to HAART medication (OR = 0.72 at P < 0.05). Medication complexity was strongly associated with maladherence to HAART medication (OR = 0.96 with P < 0.05) in the model including emotional well-being; and weakly associated with maladherence (OR = 0.97 and P < 0.07) in the model including depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. However, as HAART medication complexity increased, adherence was higher among individuals with poorer mental health but using antidepressants compared to those with better mental health (OR = 1.09 with P < 0.05 in the model including emotional well-being; OR = 1.09 and P < 0.05 in the model including depressive and/or anxiety symptoms), and compared to those with poorer mental health but not using antidepressants (OR = 1.09, P = 0.08 in the model including emotional well-being, and OR = 1.12, P < 0.05 in model including depressive and/or anxiety symptoms). In conclusion, while individuals with poorer mental health generally have poor HAART adherence, their adherence improved with the use of antidepressants as the HAART complexity increased."

Eligible subjects on stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) with HIV-1 RNA less than 200 copies per milliliter for 3 months or more were stratified by prior protease inhibitor (PI)- or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based therapy and randomized (2:1) to EFV/FTC/TDF or to stay on their baseline regimen (SBR). Patient-reported measures were quality of life (QOL; SF-36 [version 2]), treatment adherence (visual analogue scale), preference of medication (POM), perceived ease of the regimen for condition (PERC), and a 20-item HIV symptom index. Overall, 203 subjects were randomized to EFV/FTC/TDF and 97 to SBR. Fifty-three percent of subjects had previously received a PI-based regimen; 47% an NNRTI-based therapy. Throughout the study, SF-36 summary scores did not differ significantly from baseline, regardless of previous ART or treatment allocation. Adherence was 96% or more in both groups at baseline and all subsequent study visits. At study conclusion, the EFV/FTC/TDF regimen was considered easier to follow than prior regimens by 97% and 96% of subjects previously receiving PI-based and NNRTI-based therapies, respectively. Overall, 91% of subjects switched to EFV/FTC/TDF indicated a preference over their prior therapy. Switching to EFV/FTC/TDF was associated with transient worsening/emergence of dizziness and sustained improvements in several other HIV-related symptoms. In conclusion, switching virologically suppressed, HIV-1-infected subjects from PI-based or NNRTI-based regimens to EFV/FTC/TDF was associated with maintained QOL and treatment adherence, and improved ease of use and treatment satisfaction."

We used mobile phone reminders to help support adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among HIV patients at an infectious disease clinic in a tertiary hospital in Bangalore. Between March and June 2010, 139 adult HIV patients taking regular ART for at least a month received weekly reminders to support adherence. These reminders consisted of a weekly interactive call and a non-interactive neutral pictorial short message service (SMS). After four weeks of the intervention, participants were interviewed to study perceptions on preference, usefulness, potential stigma and privacy concerns associated with this intervention. Majority of the participants were urban (89%), and had at least a secondary education (85%). A total of 744 calls were made, 545 (76%) of which were received by the participants. In addition, all participants received the weekly pictorial SMS reminder. A month later, 90% of participants reported the intervention as being helpful as medication reminders, and did not feel their privacy was intruded. Participants (87%) reported that they preferred the call as reminders, just 11% favoured SMS reminders alone. Only 59% of participants viewed all the SMSs that were delivered, while 15% never viewed any at all. Participants also denied any discomfort or stigma despite 20% and 13%, respectively, reporting that another person had inadvertently received their reminder call or SMS. Mobile phone interventions are an acceptable way of supporting adherence in this setting. Voice calls rather than SMSs alone seem to be preferred as reminders. Further research to study the influence of this intervention on adherence and health maintenance is warranted."

We conducted six focus groups with 56 PLWH regarding ART adherence barriers and collected sociodemographics and ART histories. Participants were recruited through clinics and AIDS service organizations in North Carolina. Dedoose software was used to support thematic analysis. Participants were 59% male, 77% black, aged 23-67 years, and living with HIV 4-20 years. Discussions reflected the fluid, complex nature of ART adherence. Maintaining adherence required participants to indefinitely assert consistent control across multiple areas including: their HIV disease, their own bodies, health care providers, and social systems (e.g., criminal justice, hospitals, drug assistance programs). Participants described limited control over treatment options, ART's impact on their body, and inconsistent access to ART and subsequent inability to take ART as prescribed. When participants felt they had more decision-making power, intentionally choosing whether and how to take ART was not exclusively a decision about best treating HIV. Instead, through these decisions, participants tried to regain some amount of power and control in their lives. Supportive provider relationships assuaged these struggles, while perceived side-effects and multiple co-morbidities further complicated adherence. Adherence interventions need to better convey adherence as a continuous, changing process, not a fixed state. A perspective shift among care providers could also help address negative consequences of the perceived power struggles and pressures that may drive patients to exert control via intentional medication taking practices.

Neither antiretroviral resistance testing nor viral load monitoring is widely available in sub-Saharan Africa, and antiretroviral resistance can complicate the clinical management for DR-TB/HIV coinfected patients. We describe six cases of antiretroviral resistance in DR-TB patients with HIV coinfection in Lesotho. Two patients died before or immediately after antiretroviral resistance was detected by genotyping; the remaining four patients were switched to effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens. Favorable DR-TB treatment outcomes in coinfected patients require successful management of their HIV infection, including treatment with an effective ART regimen. Coinfected patients undergoing DR-TB treatment may require closer monitoring of their response to ART, including routine viral load testing, to ensure that they receive an effective ART regimen concurrent with DR-TB treatment."

Nineteen patients were studied: 7 had a previous HBeAg-positive phase and had spontaneous or therapeutically induced loss of HBeAg (group A); 12 had no previous HBeAg-positive phase (group B). Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed on serum collected during the anti-HBe-positive phase in the two groups. In group A, precore sequencing showed that 5 patients were infected by wild-type virus, 1 patient was infected with a precore mutant, and 1 patient was found to be infected by a mixture of wild-type and precore mutant viruses. In group B, precore sequencing showed that only 1 patient was infected with wild-type virus and that 11 were infected with precore mutants. In a few patients, the presence of HBeAg within immune complexes may explain HBeAg negativity. In conclusion, our results show that, in patients with anti-HBe-positive chronic hepatitis B: (1) precore mutations creating a stop codon are more frequently found in those without known previous HBeAg positivity; (2) after loss of HBeAg, the patients who have anti-HBe-positive reactivation are infected by wild-type virus, which suggests that reactivation is not related to precore mutations; (3) HBeAg negativity may be caused by immune complexes formation."

As ARV resistance becomes more prevalent with extended use of existing agents, individuals with HIV infection resistant to all three traditional classes of ARVs, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs), find themselves increasingly limited with regard to effective treatment options. The need for tolerable new drug regimens that effectively suppress viral replication while being simple to adhere to is increasingly pressing. This article reviews the epidemiology of antiretroviral drug resistance, the factors that contribute to the emergence of resistance, and presents data that support the need for early detection of resistance and maximal virologic suppression in order to delay treatment failure and reduce mortality. Healthcare providers are encouraged to optimize therapy through the use of new agents from existing drug classes, which can minimize cross-resistance, as well as agents with novel mechanisms of action, in order to realize the potential for greater viral containment and to forestall development of resistance mutations. This article evaluates several emerging therapies that are in late-stage clinical development and promise to expand treatment options for highly treatment-experienced patients with the goal of improving outcomes for HIV-infected individuals whose options for sustained antiviral efficacy are increasingly limited."
2859,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"CD8 T-cell responses are thought to be crucial for control of viremia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection but ultimately fail to control viremia in most infected persons. Studies in acute infection have demonstrated strong CD8-mediated selection pressure and evolution of mutations conferring escape from recognition, but the ability of CD8 T-cell responses that persist in late-stage infection to recognize viruses present in vivo has not been determined. Therefore, we studied 24 subjects with advanced HIV disease (median viral load = 142,000 copies/ml; median CD4 count = 71/ micro l) and determined HIV-1-specific CD8 T-cell responses to all expressed viral proteins using overlapping peptides by gamma interferon Elispot assay. Chronic-stage virus was sequenced to evaluate autologous sequences within Gag epitopes, and functional avidity of detected responses was determined. In these subjects, the median number of epitopic regions targeted was 13 (range, 2 to 39) and the median cumulative magnitude of CD8 T-cell responses was 5,760 spot-forming cells/10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (range, 185 to 24,700). On average six (range, one to 8) proteins were targeted. For 89% of evaluated CD8 T-cell responses, the autologous viral sequence was predicted to be well recognized by these responses and the majority of analyzed optimal epitopes were recognized with medium to high functional avidity by the contemporary CD8 T cells. Withdrawal of antigen by highly active antiretroviral therapy led to a significant decline both in breadth (P = 0.032) and magnitude (P = 0.0098) of these CD8 T-cell responses, providing further evidence that these responses had been driven by recognition of autologous virus. These results indicate that strong, broadly directed, and high-avidity gamma-interferon-positive CD8 T-cells directed at autologous virus persist in late disease stages, and the absence of mutations within viral epitopes indicates a lack of strong selection pressure mediated by these responses. These data imply functional impairment of CD8 T-cell responses in late-stage infection that may not be reflected by gamma interferon-based screening techniques."
15700,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Three viral proteins participate in the down-modulation of CD4 in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected cells. The underlying mechanisms have been extensively investigated. However, the physiological relevance of this phenomenon remains poorly understood. To address the role of CD4 down-modulation in HIV-1 pathogenesis in vivo, we have characterized the functional properties of nef alleles isolated from seven HIV-1-infected patients at either the stage of AIDS (late alleles) or during the asymptomatic phase of infection (early alleles). HIV-1 variants carrying these nef alleles showed striking differences in CD4 down-modulation, virus infectivity, and replication properties. Infection of T cells with late strains resulted in production of viral particles with enhanced infectivity, as compared with variants carrying early nef alleles. These differences in infectivity were observed only when viruses were produced in cells with high levels of the viral receptor, suggesting a functional link between CD4 levels and the ability of Nef to down-modulate CD4 and to enhance viral infectivity. Similarly, late nef alleles were substantially more active than early nef genes in stimulating HIV-1 replication in high CD4-positive cells, including primary lymphocytes, but not in cells expressing low levels of the CD4 receptor. Single-round assays showed that differences in infectivity between late and early strains are largely reduced when evaluated in target cells with high levels of CD4, suggesting that the inhibitory effect occurs at the entry step. Supporting this, enhanced CD4 down-modulation by late nef alleles was associated with higher levels of envelope incorporation into viral particles, a phenomenon that likely accounted for the augmented infectivity. Our data suggest a mechanistic link between the Nef-mediated CD4 down-modulation and the enhancement of replication in CD4-positive lymphocytes. As progression to disease occurs, HIV-1 Nef variants with enhanced ability to down-modulate CD4 are selected. These strains efficiently overcome the deleterious effects of CD4 and replicate more aggressively in CD4-positive primary lymphocytes. These results highlight the importance of the virus-induced CD4 down-modulation in HIV-1 pathogenesis."
7361,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Triciribine (TCN) is a tricyclic nucleoside that inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication by a unique mechanism not involving the inhibition of enzymes directly involved in viral replication. This activity requires the phosphorylation of TCN to its 5' monophosphate by intracellular adenosine kinase. New testing with a panel of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus isolates, including low-passage-number clinical isolates and selected subgroups of HIV-1, multidrug resistant HIV-1, and HIV-2, has demonstrated that TCN has broad antiretroviral activity. It was active in cell lines chronically infected with HIV-1 in which the provirus was integrated into chromosomal DNA, thereby indicating that TCN inhibits a late process in virus replication. The selection of TCN-resistant HIV-1 isolates resulted in up to a 750-fold increase in the level of resistance to the drug. DNA sequence analysis of highly resistant isolate HIV-1(H10) found five point mutations in the HIV-1 gene nef, resulting in five different amino acid changes. DNA sequencing of the other TCN-resistant isolates identified at least one and up to three of the same mutations observed in isolate HIV-1(H10). Transfer of the mutations from TCN-resistant isolate HIV-1(H10) to wild-type virus and subsequent viral growth experiments with increasing concentrations of TCN demonstrated resistance to the drug. We conclude that TCN is a late-phase inhibitor of HIV-1 replication and that mutations in nef are necessary and sufficient for TCN resistance."
3061,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Historically, older patients have shown a higher risk of HIV-1-associated dementia (HIVD). The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of aging with HIVD and minor cognitive motor disorders (MCMDs) during the late-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era and to analyze characteristics, predictive factors, and survival of older HIV-1-infected individuals affected by these disorders. A nested longitudinal study was designed for a cohort of HIV-1-infected individuals with neurological diseases. Multiple logistic regression and Cox regression for survival were employed. From 2000 to 2003, 195 patients with HIVD (53%) or MCMD (47%) were enrolled. The cumulative prevalence of these two disorders was 21%, with an increasing rate for calendar year (p < 0.001). Previous antiretroviral exposure occurred in 46% of patients. Mean CD4(+) cell count and plasma HIV-1 RNA were 144 cells/microl and 4.5 log10 copies/ml, respectively. The mean age was 44 years (SD, 9.9), with 35% of patients aged 20-39 years (I), 45% aged 40-49 years (II), and 20% aged >/=50 years (III). Among drug-naive patients, the prevalence of HIVD progressively increased in older subjects: 7.2% (I), 15.3% (II), and 27.3% (III) (p < 0.001), whereas no significant increase in HIVD with older age was observed in drug-treated subjects. Older age was independently associated with an increased risk of HIVD (odds ratio, 6.44; 95% confidence interval, 2.82-14.69) in naive but not in experienced individuals, but had no significant effect on survival. No significant effect of age was observed for MCMD. We conclude that in our cohort, HAART seems to alter the relationship between aging and HIVD, conferring a neuroprotective effect to older patients. These results may have significant implications for the clinical management of the older HIV population."

The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 has been suggested to be a causal agent of neuronal loss. Therefore, blocking gp120 neurotoxicity may be an effective way to reduce the neuronal degeneration seen in HIV patients. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) prevents gp120-mediated apoptosis in cerebellar granule cells. However, BDNF poorly crosses the blood-brain barrier and therefore may not be a suitable therapy for HIV patients. LIGA20 is a semisynthetic sphingoglycolipid that may be a valid alternative to BDNF. In fact, it has been shown that LIGA20 mimics the neuroprotective properties of BDNF. The present study was undertaken to characterize the relative potency of LIGA20 to antagonize gp120-mediated apoptosis. Cerebellar granule cells were exposed to gp120IIIB (5 nM) or stromal-cell derived factor-1 (SDF), the natural ligand for the CXCR4 receptor to which gp120 binds, alone or in combination with LIGA20 (5 microM), and cell death/survival was determined 12 and 24 hr later by various markers of apoptosis. LIGA20 blocked the neurotoxic effect of gp120 and SDF. The neurotrophic effect of LIGA20 was reversed by K252a, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to block TrkB signaling, suggesting the involvement of TrkB activation. These findings provide the rationale for exploring the ability of compounds that mimic BDNF activity to reduce neuronal cell death in HIV-1-positive patients."

Data during the years 2000 to 2012 were obtained from hospital/clinical charts. Hospitalizations were defined as a ≥24 hours hospital admission. Obstetric admissions were excluded. Causes of hospitalizations were defined as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illnesses, AIDS-related diseases (HAART adverse events, metabolic complications and non-AIDS-defining tumors/infections), and non-HIV-related diseases. Hospitalization rates are presented as admissions per 100 patient years. The number of HIV patients (58% males) in our center increased from 521 in 2000 to 1169 in 2012. 1676 hospital admissions (in 557 patients) were observed during the years of the study. The mean number of admissions per hospitalized patient was 3 ± 3.39. Hospitalization rates of HIV patients declined significantly (18.4/100 in 2000, 9/100 patient years in 2012; P = .0001), but it was higher than the rates reported in the Israeli general population (X8.76 in 2000, X6.04 in 2012). Furthermore, hospitalizations for AIDS-defining illness declined (from 46.9% to 16.1%) whereas non-HIV-related hospitalizations increased (from 31.3% to 60.1%). Lower cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell counts and older age, at the time of HIV diagnosis, were associated with higher rates of admissions (especially for AIDS-defining illnesses) and mortality. Hospitalization rates of HIV patients, especially for AIDS-defining illness, continue to decline in the late HAART era despite the increasing age of the patients, though it is still higher than that of the general population. Low CD4 cell counts and older age, at the time of HIV diagnosis, are associated with readmissions and mortality."

Highly active anti-retroviral therapy has substantially modified the course of HIV infection. Correct adherence to the treatment results in a decrease in viral load at undetectable levels and a significant increase in the number of peripheral T cell lymphocytes. In the present study association between changes in T cell subsets and treatment adherence was evaluated in 28 HIV (+) infected children, before and after 9 months on average, from starting anti-retroviral therapy. The group of 18 patients with good adherence, above 95%, showed a significant increase in CD4+CD45RA+CD62L+ naive cells percentual levels and a decrease in the CD4+CD45RA-CD62L+ central memory subset, between the two points of the follow-up period. Conversely, 10 children with failure in the adherence did not show significant differences in the percentual levels of both subsets. Improvement in the percentage of adherence among paediatric population, optimizing antiretroviral treatment, allows a quick and significant reduction of viral replication. This feature is associated with the progressive reconstitution of the immune system. "

A disproportionate number of female crack users are Black and poor. We analyzed interview data of HIV-infected women > or = 18 years of age reported to 12 health departments between July 1997 and December 2000 to ascertain if Black women reported crack use more than other HIV-infected women and to examine the relationship between crack use and antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence among Black women. Of 1655 HIV-infected women, 585 (35%) were nonusers of drugs, 694 (42%) were users of other drugs and 376 (23%) were crack users. Of the 1196 (72%) Black women, 306 (26%) were crack users. We used logistic regression to examine the effect of crack use on adherence to ART, controlling for age and education among Black women. In multivariate analysis, crack users and users of other drugs were less likely than non-users to take their ART medicines exactly as prescribed (odds ratio [OR] = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24-0.56), OR = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.36-0.68), respectively. HIV-infected Black women substance users, especially crack cocaine users, may require sustained treatment and counseling to help them reduce substance use and adhere to ART."

Between January and April 2008, we assessed the sexual behaviors of 247 HIV-infected South Indians in care. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine predictors of being in a HIV-seroconcordant primary relationship, being sexually active, and reporting unprotected sex. Over three-fourths (80%) of participants were HAART-experienced. Among the 58% of participants who were currently in a seroconcordant relationship, one-third were serodiscordant when enrolling into care. Approximately two-thirds (63.2%) of participants were sexually active; 9.0% reported unprotected sex. In the multivariable analyses, participants who were in a seroconcordant primary relationship were more likely to have children, use alcohol, report unprotected sex, and have been enrolled in care for >12 months. Sexually active participants were more likely to be on HAART, have a prior tuberculosis diagnosis, test Herpes simplex type 2 antibody seropositive, and have low general health perceptions. Participants who reported unprotected sex were more likely to be in a seroconcordant relationship, be childless, want to have a child, and use alcohol. We did not document an association between HAART and unprotected sex. Among HIV-infected Indians in primary care, predictors of unprotected sex included alcohol use and desire for children. Prevention interventions for Indian couples should integrate reproductive health and alcohol use counseling at entry into care."

We aimed to assess disclosure rates of HIV patients and the reactions they encountered in comparison to patients with chronic viral hepatitis or diabetes mellitus and patients' general perception of disease-specific discrimination. We constructed a self-report questionnaire, anonymously assessing the size of the social environment, the persons who had been informed, and the experienced reactions as perceived by the disclosing patients, to be rated on 1-4 point Likert scales. In addition, patients were asked whether they perceive general discrimination in Germany. One hundred and seventy-one patients were asked to participate. Five rejected, thus questionnaires from 83 patients with HIV, 42 patients with chronic viral hepatitis B (n = 9) or C (n = 33), and 41 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type I n = 14, type II n = 27) were analysed. Whereas the size of the social environment did not differ, HIV-infected patients were least likely to disclose their disease (60.7%, SD ± 31.9) to their social environment as compared to patients with chronic viral hepatitis (84.2 ± 23.3%, p<0.0001), or diabetes mellitus (94.4 ± 10.3%, p<0.0001), respectively. Within the HIV patient group, the mean disclosure rate was highest to partners (90.9%), followed by the public environment (65.2%), friends (59.4%) and family members (43.8%). HIV patients experienced supportive reactions after 79.3 ± 26.4% of disclosures, which was the case in 91.4 ± 19.6% and 75.7 ± 36.1% of patients with hepatitis or diabetes mellitus, respectively. 69.5% of HIV patients stated to perceive general discrimination in Germany. We conclude that HIV patients had experienced supportive reactions after the majority of disclosures, but the low rate points out that their information strategy had been very selective. Societal discrimination of HIV patients is still an issue and needs to be further addressed."

Based on clinical and electrophysiological data, 47% had distal symmetric polyneuropathy, 11% chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), 8.5% toxic neuropathy related to 2-3-dideoxyinosine (DDI), 8.5% cranial neuropathy, 8.5% mononeuropathy multiplex or isolated focal neuropathy, 8.5% progressive lumbosacral polyradiculopathy, and 8.5% myopathy. Half of the patients exhibited previous or concomitant signs of central nervous system involvement and 18 patients died during the study period. CIDP and cranial neuropathies usually appeared early in the course of the disease and consequently showed neurological improvement. Nerve conduction studies of DDI related toxic neuropathies showed distal axono-myelinic sensitivo-motor neuropathy, differing from CIDP by the absence of a conduction block. Distal symmetric polyneuropathies, frequent in the advanced systemic illness, do not systematically require an extended workup, but more unusual peripheral neuropathies which might be treatable necessitate further investigations (electromyography, radiology, serological blood tests; protein chemistry and routine workup of the cerebrospinal fluid). For example, progressive lumbosacral polyradiculopathies responded to early treatment, with a better outcome in one case of herpetic origin than in another case due to cytomegalovirus infection. Our observations suggest that myopathies in HIV infected patients should first be tackled by temporary interruption of virostatic medication, followed by muscle biopsy if the symptoms persist."

In adult HIV-positive highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART)-treated patients (without central nervous system infections and undergoing lumbar punctures for clinical reasons) cerebrospinal fluid albumin to serum ratios (CSAR), total tau, phosphorylated tau, 1-42 beta amyloid, and neopterin were measured. In 101 adult patients, cerebrospinal fluid-to-serum albumin ratios were 4.8 (3.7-6.1) with 12 patients (11.9%) presenting age-defined impaired blood brain barrier. A significant correlation was observed between CSAR and total tau (p = 0.005), phosphorylated tau (p = 0.008), and 1-42 beta amyloid (p = 0.040). Patients with impaired blood brain barrier showed significantly higher total tau (201.6 vs. 87.3 pg/mL, p = 0.010), phosphorylated tau (35.3 vs. 32.1 ng/mL, p = 0.035), and 1-42 beta amyloid (1134 vs. 830 pg/mL, p = 0.045).

Only 64 cases of proven PT were recorded during the 33-month survey. The patients were similar to other patients with AIDS in terms of age, sex, and risk factors for HIV infection. PT occurred mainly in patients with advanced immunodeficiency (mean [+/- SD] CD4+ lymphocyte count, 40 +/- 75/mm3). Clinical features of PT usually include fever, cough and dyspnea; the associated radiological findings were mainly diffuse interstitial infiltrates. Serological data were uninformative. The treatment for PT was the same as that for cerebral toxoplasmosis. A clinical response was observed for 47% of patients, 23% of whom relapsed. Twenty-four patients (37%) died of toxoplasmosis, and 17 (27%) died of other causes. The median survival time was 150 days.

None were on antiretroviral therapy. Only 3% had a positive CSF HIV p24 antigen test. The CSF beta 2-microglobulin levels increased as the CD4+ T cell count decreased. Intrathecal production of beta 2-microglobulin was suggested by finding CSF concentrations greater than serum concentrations in 15% of patients. The CSF beta 2-microglobulin levels rose as in vitro T helper cell function deteriorated, independent of CD4+ T cell count. CSF beta 2-microglobulin levels paralleled CSF IgG, IgG index, and IgG synthesis. Higher CSF beta 2-microglobulin levels were found in persons with positive CSF oligoclonal bands. CSF beta 2-microglobulin concentration may serve as a marker for subclinical neurologic damage due to HIV. If this is established, defining the effect of anti-HIV interventions on CSF beta 2-microglobulin would be warranted."

Patients were classified according to the date of diagnosis in the first (1996-2000, n = 35), second (2001-2006, n = 26), and recent or third highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) period (2007-2011, n = 11). Overall, the incidence of PML decreased from 14.8 cases/1,000 patients/year in 1996 to 2.6 in 2005 and 0.8 in 2011, and nearly two-thirds of recent cases (64 %) were observed in HIV patients not attending clinical visits. The baseline median CD4+ count was higher in recently PML-diagnosed patients (77 vs. 86 vs. 101 cells/mm(3); p < 0.01), and this fact was associated with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory profile (from 11 to 31 to 55 %, p = 0.007) and with a significantly longer survival (attributable death, 54 vs. 35 vs. 36 %, respectively, p < 0.01). Thus, the overall 1-year and 3-year survival rates were 55 and 50 %, respectively, increasing to 79 % at 1 year for patients with CD4+ count above 100 cells/mm(3) at diagnosis. In a Cox regression analysis, an older age (hazard ratio, HR 0.76), a baseline CD4+ count above 100 cells/mm(3) (HR 0.33), and a CSF inflammatory profile (HR 0.12) were significantly associated with a longer survival. The clinical presentation and outcome of PML in AIDS patients continue to change dramatically. Now, a declining incidence and long-term survival is observed."

HIV-1 RNA was detected in 90% of CSF samples, and RNA levels > or = 10,000 copies/mL were found in 6 (75%) of 8 children with severe neurocognitive impairment (P = .08) and 11 (73%) of 15 children with a cognitive index < or = 85 (P = .04). Higher RNA levels were associated with abnormal brain imaging scans (P = .04) and with neurocognitive deficits (P = .04). Thus, HIV-1 is present within the CNS of most infected children, and neurocognitive impairment appears to be associated with increased HIV-1 replication."
6615,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The question of whether HIV-1 RNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is derived from viral replication in the central nervous system or simply reflects the transit of infected lymphocytes from the blood compartment has long been a matter of debate. Some studies found no correlation between CSF and plasma viral load, whereas others did. The lack of a correlation between the two compartments suggests that the presence of HIV-1 RNA is not simply due to the passive passage of the virus from blood to CSF but rather due to intrathecal replication. To evaluate the correlation between plasma and CSF HIV-1 RNA levels and to identify situations in which there is no correlation between the two compartments, seventy patients were prospectively studied. The association between CSF and plasma viral load was evaluated in the total population and in subgroups of patients with similar characteristics. A correlation between the CSF and plasma compartments was observed for patients undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), those with a CD4 T lymphocyte count lower than 200 cells/mm³, and those with increased CSF protein content. On the other hand, no correlation was observed for patients without adequate virological control, who had a CD4 count higher than 200 cells/mm³ and who did not use HAART. The correlation between the two compartments observed in some patients suggests that CSF HIV-1 RNA levels may reflect plasma levels in these subjects. In contrast, the lack of a correlation between the two compartments in patients who were not on HAART and who had normal CSF proteins and a poor virological control possibly indicates compartmentalization of the virus in CSF and, consequently, plasma-independent intrathecal viral replication."

The courses of hepatitis B, C, and D are modified by HIV infection. With hepatitis B, increased carriage rates, increased viral replication, and milder liver injury are seen. The degree of HIV-induced immunosuppression does not correlate well with liver injury or amount of hepatitis B viral replication. With progression to AIDS, surface antibody titers can decline, resulting in reactivation of latent hepatitis B virus or reinfection with another subtype. hepatitis B virus may enhance progression to AIDS. Preliminary data suggest that HIV infection can prolong or increase hepatitis C or D viremia and decrease the accuracy of tests for hepatitis C. Interferon may have efficacy against hepatitis C but rarely against hepatitis B in patients who are coinfected with HIV. Zidovudine, ganciclovir, and foscarnet also may be active against these hepatotropic viruses."

The sample was stratified by initial disease stage; subjects were classified 'asymptomatic' if they had no HIV-related constitutional symptoms, 'symptomatic' if they had at least one symptom, and 'AIDS' if symptomatic with a history of opportunistic infections and/or CD4 count less than 200 cells/ micro L. For the overall group, changes in mean QoL (Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form-36 [SF-36]) ratings were non-significant, irrespective of initial disease stage or prior HAART exposure. Although overall there were health status improvements over the two-year period, clinical changes were generally unrelated to changes in QoL ratings. Patients with better immunologic/virologic outcomes showed slight improvements in mean QoL ratings, while those with poorer clinical outcomes showed slight deterioration. These within-group changes over time were statistically non-significant. The corresponding between-group differences in changes in SF-36 social and psychological dimensions were significant. Statistically significant differences among the three disease stage groups on a number of subscales at baseline (Physical Function, Body Pain, Vitality, Role Limitations due to Physical Problems) became non-significant (i.e. nullified) at follow-up. Significant increases in mean number of symptoms for the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups were not associated with two-year changes in QoL ratings. Overall, wellbeing was moderately stable over the two-year follow-up period, although somewhat affected by symptom changes and immunologic/virologic outcome. The study results contrast with pre-HAART longitudinal research, in which deterioration in all areas of QoL occurred."

This study evaluates stigma among 277 Mozambicans who were on an antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens for a full year. Using bivariate and multiple regression analyses, we examine psychosocial factors (disclosure decisions, perceived social support, and depression) associated with stigma, at ART initiation and 1 year later. We found 1 year after initiating ART, participants reported no change in stigma, a decrease in perceived social support, and an increase in depressive symptomology. Disclosing HIV status to friends (versus family or partner) was associated with lower levels of stigma. These findings suggest that HIV care in comparable settings should include counselling, support groups, and peer support, that includes stigma and disclosure concerns prior to and during the first year following diagnosis. Most importantly, assessment and treatment of depression should be incorporated into ongoing HIV care."

The aim of this study was the detection of mitochondrial dysfunction by flow cytometry in lymphocytes from HIV-infected individuals and its association with blood lactate levels, clinical and virologic status, and the different NRTI-based therapies. Lower peripheral blood lymphocytes with mitochondrial dysfunction (PBLmd) percentages were observed in healthy controls (1.2, interquartile range [IQR] = 0.4-1.9) than in patients (2.2, IQR = 0.9-3.7; P < 0.01). Stavudine-containing therapy showed higher PBLmd percentages (3.0, IQR = 1.1-4.5) than no treatment (2.1, IQR = 0.8-2.8; P < 0.05) or zidovudine-based therapy (0.9, IQR = 0.3-1.4; P < 0.01). A significant inverse correlation was found between PBLmd and CD4 T-cell percentage and absolute count. Patients with an AIDS diagnosis had higher PBLmd percentage (2.7, IQR = 1.1-4.4) than HIV-positive non-AIDS patients (1.4, IQR = 0.6-3.0; P = 0.012). In multivariate analysis, use of stavudine (odds ratio [OR] = 5.86, 95% CI = 1.81-19.01, P = 0.003) and CD4 T-cell counts <200/microL (OR = 4.51, 95% CI = 1.38-14.70, P = 0.012) were independent predictors of high PBLmd percentage.

Median initial CD4 cell count was 192x106 cells/L, follow-up was 31 months, and time to maximum CD4 cell response was 20 months. Age groups were not different for baseline CD4 cell count, baseline human immunodeficiency virus RNA load, or treatment history. CD4 cell increase, stratified by age quartiles, differed during months 3-36 of HAART (P=.023). Maximum CD4 cell increase from start of HAART differed by age group (P=.0003), as did maximum CD4 cell count (P<10-4). Multivariate analysis confirmed the inverse relationship between age and maximum CD4 cell response (P=.023). Time to a CD4 increase of >200x106 cells/L was shorter for patients in the younger age groups (P=.0026), as confirmed by multivariate analysis (P<10-4). Younger age may favor CD4 cell restoration because of preserved thymic function."

We assessed the performance of stimulated skin wrinkling-eutectic mixture of local anesthetic (SSW-EMLA) test compared with brief peripheral neuropathy screening (BPNS) to detect HIV neuropathy.This is a cross-sectional study conducted in HIV-positive patients. A modified skin wrinkling grading was used to assess SSW-EMLA effect. BPNS-detectable neuropathy was assessed by a combination of neuropathy severity scoring scale (subjective) and objective method of sensory and tendon reflex examination. The SSW-EMLA test accuracy with reference to BPNS was assessed using sensitivity and specificity and predictive values.In a total of 99 HIV patients, 61.6% were males and the majority age group were between 30 and 40 years (52%). The neuropathy detection was SSW-EMLA test 36.4% versus BPNS 15.2% (P = .04). The sensitivity of SSW-EMLA test was 60.0% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 34.5-81.7], specificity 67% (95% CI 63.3-3-71.7), and overall accuracy of 66.7% (95% CI 58.9-73.2).The SSW-EMLA test detected many more peripheral neuropathy cases than BPNS in HIV patients and has potential as an alternative test for screening for HIV neuropathy in resource-constraint hospitals in Indonesia."

Results from these studies remain conflicting. We conducted this meta-analysis to estimate the overall association of SVR with rs12979860 and rs8099917. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Scholar Google, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases for all articles before July 30, 2012. The odds ratio (OR) corresponding to the 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the association. The statistical heterogeneity among studies was assessed with the I(2) statistics. Begg's test and Egger's test were performed to evaluate the publication bias. Eventually, twenty studies were selected for the meta-analysis. The IL-28B SNPs rs12979860 genotype CC and rs8099917 genotype TT significantly positive associated with SVR in patients infected chronic HCV genotype 1 to PEG-INF/RBV therapy (OR=4.473, 95% CI=3.814-5.246, OR=5.171, 95% CI=4.372-6.117 respectively).

Univariate analysis of potential risk factors for mother-to-child transmission showed an association between primiparity and increased transmission rate: odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-4.6, P < 0.05. Analysis by logistic regression confirmed this association (adjusted odds ratio 2.4) and showed, in addition, a negative association between transmission rate and elective Caesarean section (adjusted odds ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.97, P < 0.05). The effect of primiparity was less pronounced in combination with elective Caesarean section (odds ratio 1.7) than with other delivery modes (odds ratio 2.5, difference not significant).

The Abbott HIVAG-1 Enzyme Immunoassay was used to analyze serial serum samples from patients enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study of children born to mothers infected with HIV-1. There were 85 subjects who were followed from birth whose HIV-1 infection status could be definitely determined as of March, 1990. Of these 22 (26%) were infected with HIV-1 and 63 (74%) were uninfected. Overall the sensitivity of the test was 77% (95% confidence interval (CI), 55 to 92%) and the specificity was 97% (95% CI, 89 to 99%). The positive predictive value of a single positive test was 89% (95% CI, 67 to 99%) and of two or more positive tests was 100% (95% CI, 50 to 100%). The sensitivity of the test varied greatly with age. For 36 children from whom sera were collected during the first month of life the specificity of the antigen test was 100% but the sensitivity was only 20%. Overall in the first 6 months of life the sensitivity was less than 50%. The Abbott HIV-1 antigen test is useful as an early predictor of HIV-1 infection in children whose mothers are infected."

Patients receiving ART were recruited into the cross-sectional study from three treatment centres in Kampala, Uganda. The number of missed doses over the last three days was assessed by structured patient interviews and dichotomized at +/-95% adherence. Reasons for non-adherence were assessed with both structured patient interviews and unstructured qualitative interviews. Independent predictors of non-adherence were assessed with multivariate logistic regression. In all, 304 HIV-infected persons on ART were enrolled into the study. Factors associated with non-adherence were marital status (odds ratio (OR) = 2.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-6.50) and low monthly income <50 US$ [OR = 2.77, 95% CI 1.64-4.67].

All HIV-positive patients had at least one poor prognostic feature, which included either extranodal disease (10 patients), Karnofsky performance status less than 70% (six patients), a CD4 count less than 100/microL (six patients), or a prior history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS; one patient). Both HTLV-I-positive patients had an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, a poor prognostic feature in that setting. Complete response (CR) occurred in 10 patients (71%; 95% confidence interval, 48% to 95%) and partial response (PR) occurred in three patients (21%), yielding an overall objective response rate of approximately 93%. The estimated Kaplan-Meier median survival was 17.4 months; seven of 12 HIV-positive patients are alive and disease-free with a median follow-up of 15 months (range, 7 to 24 months). Hospitalization was required after 19% of treatment cycles due to fever associated with granulocytopenia. Documented or suspected opportunistic infection occurred in five patients (36%), bacteremia occurred in three patients (21%), and candidemia occurred in one patient (7%). There was one treatment-related death attributable to disseminated aspergillosis. This pilot study suggests that infusional CDE may be a highly active regimen capable of producing durable remissions in a high proportion of patients with HIV-related NHL. Further study is required to confirm this observation."

However, due to difficulties in diagnosis and reporting, true burden of HIV-associated TB in children is unknown. The objective of this study was to describe the incidence of pulmonary TB (PTB) after antiretroviral therapy (ART) and to study risk factors. A retrospective study was performed based on routinely collected data from China national pediatric free antiretroviral treatment database. A total of 3365 children under 15 years on ART from July 2005 to October 2012 were included. Multivariable logistic regression was used to detect associated factors. Two thousand nine hundred and ninety (89%) children got infected from HIV-positive mother, with median age of 6.7 (4.1, 10.0) years at highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation in this program. Seventy-seven (2.3%) children were diagnosed with PTB after ART during 7.3 years cohort observation. Median time of occurrence was 212 (30-514) days. Overall incidence was 0.83 (0.65-1.01)/100 person-years (py), with the peak of 3.6/100 py in the first 3 months after antiretroviral treatment. WHO stage IV at baseline showed 2 (95% CI 1.0-6.8) times more risk for developing TB. Late clinical stage at ART initiation was shown to relate with TB incidence. PTB coinfection leads to higher mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment of HIV are highly required to reduce HIV-associated morbidity and mortality due to TB. "

One hundred thirty-nine patients with various stages of HIV infection were interviewed in a prospective cohort study based in a primary care practice of a community-based teaching hospital. Patients were interviewed twice at 6-month intervals using three health value measures--the time trade off, rating scale, and Quality of Well-being Scale--and three health status measures: the 18-item Mental Health Inventory, the Dyspnea-Fatigue Index, and the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 Health Survey. The health status of HIV-infected patients was compromised and, with the exception of mental health, generally was worse among patients with more advanced HIV-infection. Rating scale and Quality of Well-being Scale scores were related inversely to disease stage, but time-trade off scores generally were higher regardless of disease stage. Health value measures showed moderate relationships with measures of physical functioning (r = 0.34-0.68) but only a fair relationship with mental health (r = 0.00-0.48). The health status of HIV-infected patients who remained asymptomatic or remained symptomatic but without developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) changed little over 6 months, whereas the health status of patients with AIDS and of patients manifesting progression of HIV-infection deteriorated over time. In contrast, health values, particularly time-tradeoff scores, remained stable even in the face of changes in health status and disease progression. With the exception of mental health, the impact of HIV infection on health status tends to parallel the clinical stage of disease. Health values of HIV-infected patients, however, generally are high and correlate better with physical functioning than with mental health."

However, cutaneous involvement in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients is less common, and very rarely can be the initial presenting symptom for the diagnosis of AIDS. We present here an unusual case of multiple diffuse cutaneous nodular lesions predominantly in face, trunk, and upper extremities diagnosed initially on aspiration cytology as histoplasmosis. Subsequent serological test revealed positivity for HIV 1 and 2, along with a low CD4 count and low CD4:CD3 ratio. The cytomorphological features were further corroborated by histology and histochemical stains. Hence, cutaneous histoplasmosis can cause multiple wide spread nodular or umbilicated lesions in AIDS patients as the initial presentation. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a rapid, cost effective tool for diagnosis of the fungi from such lesions and initiating work up for immunocompromised states including AIDS."

This was a cross-sectional study of patients with HIV who were seen by the ophthalmology consultation service between September 2003 and May 2011 at a single academic institution in Washington, DC. Medical history and ophthalmic findings were reviewed. Patients with complete laboratory data dated within 3 months of their presenting eye examination were included. Descriptive statistics were performed. The records of 151 patients were included in the final analysis. All patients had complete laboratory data dated within 3 months of their presenting eye examination. Sixty-eight (45 %) patients and fifty-eight (50 %) of those with a diagnosis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were diagnosed with an HIV-related ophthalmic disease. The leading anterior segment disease was herpes zoster ophthalmicus and the leading posterior segment disease was HIV retinopathy. Of the 151 included patients, 78 (52 %) were receiving HAART at the time of the examination. Thirty-one (42 %) of those not receiving HAART were diagnosed with an HIV-related ophthalmic disease. In this study, we find that the overall prevalence of ocular disease has decreased since the introduction of HAART. However, HIV patients continue to be predisposed to developing ophthalmic disease at higher rates than the general population. Visual dysfunction remains an important source of morbidity in HIV patients, particularly in those with AIDS. Measures for improvement include increased communication between infectious disease specialists and ophthalmologists to ensure adherence to HAART and routine eye examinations."

Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. We identified negative and positive psychological themes associated with both drug use and adherence. Participants described tension between negative feelings (denial, shame, and perceived isolation) and positive feelings (acceptance, motivation, empowerment, and perceived connectedness), and they associated this tension with their own drug using and adherence behaviors. Sustained antiretroviral therapy adherence may require increased emphasis on understanding the psychological experience of HIV-infected drug users. "

Blood samples were drawn from 98 intravenous drug users (IVDU), 100 female high-class commercial sex workers (CSW) and 50 male outpatients (MOP) at a sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic in Chiang Mai, Thailand. These blood samples were analyzed for GBV-C/HGV RNA; antibodies against second envelope protein of GBV-C/HGV (anti-E2); anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV-Ab); hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb); and antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-Ab). Prevalences of GBV-C/HGV RNA, anti-E2, HCV-Ab, HBcAb and HIV-Ab were 27.6%, 16.3%, 84.7%, 76.5% and 45.0% in IVDU; 0%, 21.5%, 2.0%, 72.0% and 11.0% in CSW; 6.0%, 13.6%, 0%, 64.0% and 14.0% in MOP. While the prevalence of GBV-C/HGV RNA was higher in IVDU than in CSW and MOP, comparable prevalences of anti-E2 among the three populations were found. Intravenous drug injection showed association with GBV-C/HGV RNA, while history of STD associated with anti-E2. In conclusion, intravenous drug injection and STD were found to be risk factors for the previous exposure to GBV-C/HGV, but STD did not increase the risk of the GBV-C/HGV viraemia."

The prevalence of non-sexual and sexual risk factors associated with acquisition of hepatitis C and HIV were studied in HIV-mono-infected, HCV-mono-infected, and HCV/HIV-co-infected individuals. None of the 114 HCV-mono-infected patients tested positive for HIV and this finding was associated with a significantly lower number of men who have sex with men (MSM) among the HCV-mono-infected subjects than among either the HIV-mono-infected or HCV/HIV-co-infected individuals. Unprotected anal intercourse and sex for money or drugs were reported less often by HCV-mono-infected individuals than by HIV-mono-infected and HCV/HIV-co-infected subjects. Having sex with an intravenous-drug user (IVDU) was reported more frequently by both HCV-mono-infected and HCV/HIV-co-infected individuals than by HIV-mono-infected individuals. Sub-analysis of the group of MSM revealed that IVDU differentiated between HIV-mono-infected and HCV/HIV-co-infected subjects. These results reveal that the lower prevalence of HIV in HCV patients is related to a lower number of MSM in this group and that sex with an IVDU is a surrogate marker for drug abuse related to acquiring HCV but not HIV.

The population studied included 44 residents of a rural area with chronic HCV infection, 39 had chronic hepatitis C and 37 were patients on hemodialysis. All these Japanese patients had HCV RNA of genotype II. Blood samples were collected once a year from 1992 to 1995. From 1993 to 1995 between the groups, there was no significant difference in change of HCV RNA levels of 44 residents with chronic HCV infection, with and without liver dysfunction, nor was there any change in the 31 hemodialysis patients from 1992 to 1995. The HCV RNA levels in the 25 with chronic hepatitis who did not respond to interferon-alpha during 1992-1993 returned to pretreatment levels after the cessation of interferon treatment. In two of six hemodialysis patients who were infected with HCV during this observation period, HCV RNA was eliminated within one year, and the remaining four became HCV carriers. HCV RNA levels in the latter rose rapidly after infection and were sustained at a high level throughout the study period. Thus, HCV RNA level did not change remarkably during a three-year period, a finding which supports that it does not correlate with deterioration of liver damage and aging of HCV carriers."

These studies have provided the impetus to change guidelines for treatment of current and recovering IDUs, with a move toward individualized HCV treatment assessment and the removal of defined periods of illicit drug use abstinence. Strategies to improve access to HCV treatment for current and recovering IDUs include drug dependency treatment education and training for hepatologists and other HCV treatment physicians, HCV treatment education and training for addiction medicine physicians, development of multidisciplinary clinics, and peer-based eduction and support for individuals considering and receiving HCV treatment."

We analysed information on Fe status and inflammation from a randomised, double blind, controlled phase-III clinical trial in Lusaka, Zambia and Mwanza, Tanzania. Malnourished patients (n 1815) were recruited at referral to antiretroviral therapy (ART) into a two-stage nutritional rehabilitation programme, randomised to receive a lipid-based nutrient supplement with or without added micronutrients. Fe was included in the intervention arm during the second stage, given from 2 to 6 weeks post-ART. Hb, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) were measured at recruitment and 6 weeks post-ART. Multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the impact of the intervention, and the effect of reducing inflammation from recruitment to week 6 on Hb and Fe status. There was no effect of the intervention on Hb, serum ferritin, sTfR or serum CRP. A one-log decrease of serum CRP from recruitment to week 6 was associated with a 1.81 g/l increase in Hb (95% CI 0.85, 2.76; P< 0.001), and a 0.11 log decrease in serum ferritin (95% CI - 0.22, 0.03; P= 0.012) from recruitment to week 6. There was no association between the change in serum CRP and the change in sTfR over the same time period (P= 0.78). In malnourished, HIV-infected adults receiving dietary Fe, a reduction in inflammation in the early ART treatment period appears to be a precondition for recovery from anaemia."

We analysed data from three trials of modafinil or armodafinil for HIV-positive patients with fatigue, including 36 co-infected with HCV, to compare treatment response and safety parameters related to HCV status. One hundred and twenty patients received active drug and 70 were randomized to placebo. Fatigue response rate to modafinil/armodafinil was 100% for patients with HCV (18/18) and 73% (74/102) for patients without HCV. Placebo response rate was 28% (5/18) and 29% (15/52), respectively. Depressive symptoms improved only when energy improved. Viral load declined from baseline after 12 and 26 weeks of active medication. CD4 cell count did not change, nor did alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase for patients with HCV. Patients with haematocrit below the reference range responded, as well as patients whose values were within the reference range. Modafinil and armodafinil appear effective and well tolerated for treating fatigue among both HCV-positive and HCV-negative patients with HIV/AIDS, suggesting that they may hold promise for HIV-positive patients considering alpha interferon/ribavirin treatment for HCV. Further investigation in a focused trial is warranted."
8128,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on progression of hepatic fibrosis in HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection are not well understood. Deaths from liver diseases have risen in the post-HAART era, yet some cross-sectional studies have suggested that HAART use is associated with improved fibrosis rates. In a retrospective cohort of 533 HIV mono-infected and 127 HIV/HCV co-infected patients, followed between January 1991 and July 2005 at a university-based HIV clinic, we investigated the relationship between cumulative HAART exposure and hepatic fibrosis, as measured by the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI). We used a novel methodological approach to estimate the dose-response relationship of the effect of HAART exposure on APRI. HAART was associated with increasing APRI over time in HIV/HCV co-infected patients suggesting that they may be experiencing cumulative hepatotoxicity from antiretrovirals. The estimated median change (95% confidence interval) in APRI per one year of HAART intake was of -0.46% (-1.61% to 0.71%) in HIV mono-infected compared to 2.54% (-1.77% to 7.03%) in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Similar results were found when the direct effect of HAART intake since the last visit was estimated on the change in APRI. HAART use associated is with increased APRI in patients with HIV/HCV co-infection. Therefore treatment for HCV infection may be required to slow the growing epidemic of end-stage liver disease in this population."

Consequently, a prospective randomized trial was conducted to evaluate a new peptide-based enteral formula (NEF) in contrast to a standard enteral formula (SEF) in patients with HIV infection. Eighty early-stage largely asymptomatic patients were randomized into a dietary regimen supplemented with either a ready-to-feed NEF (18.7% protein, 65.5% carbohydrate, 15.8% fat; 1.28 kcal/ml) or SEF (14% protein, 55% carbohydrate, 31% fat; 1.06 kcal/ml). Patients received 2-3 8-oz cans of the NEF or SEF supplement per day for 6 mo. Parameters evaluated at 0 (baseline), 3, and 6 mo included adherence, weight change, anthropometric measurements, serum biochemical indices, gastrointestinal symptoms, physical performance, and intercurrent health events (including hospitalizations). For the 56 evaluable patients, those supplemented with NEF maintained their body weight significantly (p = 0.04) better, had significantly (p = 0.03) more stable triceps skin-fold measurements, and had significantly (p = 0.04) lower blood urea nitrogen than patients consuming the SEF supplement. Consumption of the NEF supplement was also associated with significantly reduced hospitalizations during the 3- to 6-mo evaluation period (p = 0.02). The NEF supplement was well tolerated and did not result in untoward clinical effects. These data suggest that supplemental use of an NEF provides superior nutritional management compared with an SEF for patients with early-stage HIV infection."

It has a number of similarities to, as well as differences from, Sjögren's syndrome (SS). We studied the sialochemistry of stimulated parotid saliva of 11 patients with HIV associated salivary gland disease and bilateral parotid gland enlargement, and compared these findings with those of 15 HIV negative controls, 13 HIV positive individuals with no salivary gland involvement and 18 individuals with SS. The patients with HIV associated salivary gland disease had a significant decrease in the level of salivary protein, with increases in salivary IgA, lysozyme and albumin compared to the HIV negative controls. There were no changes in concentration of electrolytes. The sialochemistry among the patients with HIV associated salivary gland disease was unrelated to the degree of immune suppression and did not change over a 6 month period. The observed changes were similar to those of SS but less pronounced. The similar clinical, histologic and sialochemical features of HIV associated salivary gland disease and SS suggest that these conditions share common pathogenetic mechanisms, which may be modified in the former by the HIV infection."
4666,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The choice of an antiretroviral regimen can often impact on adherence, treatment satisfaction and therefore influence on clinical outcome. These concerns are particularly true in adolescents. In this setting, adherence is usually affected by multifactor events and biopsychosocial factors, which connect and changeover time. We evaluated the effect of a switch to a single-pill fixed-dose regimen on patient-reported outcomes, virologic and immunologic outcomes, and safety in a cohort of adolescents with perinatal HIV-1 infection. In addition, we evaluated the effect on low-level residual HIV-RNA. An open-label, non-randomised study was performed: 12 adolescents with a confirmed viremia <50 copies/mL treated with lamivudine or emtricitabine, tenofovir and efavirenz were switched to one-pill fixed-dose regimen of emtricitabine/tenofovir/efavirenz. At the end of follow-up, the new regimen was associated with improvements in treatment satisfaction, HIV-symptoms, whereas adherence remained high. No immunological or virological significative changes were observed. No side-effects were registered. Moreover, the low-level residual HIV-RNA was <3 copie/mL in all patients. One-pill fixed-dose regimen is an added value that favours adherence, reduces HIV-symptoms, improves patients' satisfaction and could better control of HIV-RNA in adolescents, too."
2678,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Immunological studies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients suggest that the disease progression is accompanied by a defective production of type 1 cytokines (interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-12], an increased production of type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10), and an increased production of IgE. HIV infection is also associated with activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis function and increased plasma and urinary cortisol concentrations. As cortisol is involved in the physiological regulation of cytokines, a study was conducted to examine cytokine patterns in two groups of hypercortisolemic patients, one with normal sensitivity to glucocorticoids and the other with glucocorticoid resistance. Ten HIV-infected patients with normal receptor affinity to glucocorticoids (AIDS-C), 10 HIV-infected patients with low receptor affinity to glucocorticoids (AIDS-GR), and 20 healthy subjects were studied. Receptor characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were evaluated by [3H]dexamethasone binding. Serum cortisol and urinary free cortisol were measured by RIA. Serum ACTH and IgE were measured by immunoradiometric assay, and IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 cytokines and interferon-gamma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. AIDS-C patients showed low IL-2 and high IL-4, IL-10, and IgE concentratios; conversely, AIDS-GR patients showed high IL-2 and low IL-4 and IgE concentrations. Thus, in HIV infection, elevated cortisol levels suppress cell-mediated immunity and stimulate humoral immunity, whereas this response is not detected in cortisol-resistant patients. These findings indicate that cortisol and its receptors are critically involved in the regulation of immune function in HIV infection."

We enrolled 200 pairs of sex- and age-matched patients with HCC and unrelated healthy controls. TNF-alpha polymorphisms were detected with polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) were detected. We used a structured questionnaire to obtain information about substance use habits.Multivariate analysis indicated that TNF308.2 allele (odds ratio [OR], 3.23; p = 0.011), habitual betel quid chewing (OR, 3.70; p = 0.011), HBsAg (OR, 23.62; p = 0.0001), and anti-HCV (OR, 38.73; p = 0.0001) were independent risk factors for HCC. Having at least 2 substance use habits was associated with risk for HCC. The more substance use habits, the higher the OR for HCC (p(for trend) = 0.0001). There were additive interactions among TNF308.2 allele, substance use habits, and chronic HBV/HCV infection. Multivariate analysis indicated that TNF308.2 allele (p = 0.001), cigarette smoking (p = 0.0001), and alcohol drinking (p = 0.0001) were independent risk factors for habitual betel quid chewing. Moreover, patients harboring the TNF308.2 allele and/or those with habits of substance use had low serum albumin concentration and platelet count (each p = 0.0001). In conclusion, there are independent and additive interactive effects among the TNF308.2 allele, substance use habits, and chronic HBV/HCV infection on the risk for HCC. Substance use habits or carrying the TNF308.2 allele correlates with disease severity and hepatic fibrosis, which may contribute to higher risks for HCC."

In the present study, we demonstrated mRNA and cell surface expression of HIV-1 receptors CD4 and the chemokine receptors CCR-5 and CXCR-4 in fractionated cells representing multiple stages of hematopoietic development. Chemokine receptor function was documented in subsets of cells by calcium flux in response to a cognate ligand. Productive infection by HIV-1 via these receptors was observed with the notable exception of stem cells, in which case the presence of CD4, CXCR-4, and CCR-5, as documented by single-cell analysis for expression and function, was insufficient for infection. Neither productive infection, transgene expression, nor virus entry was detectable following exposure of stem cells to either wild-type HIV-1 or lentivirus constructs pseudotyped in HIV-1 envelopes of macrophage-tropic, T-cell-tropic, or dualtropic specificity. Successful entry into stem cells of a vesicular stomatitis virus G protein-pseudotyped HIV-1 construct demonstrated that the resistance to HIV-1 was mediated at the level of virus-cell membrane fusion and entry. These data define the hematopoietic stem cell as a sanctuary cell which is resistant to HIV-1 infection by a mechanism independent of receptor and coreceptor expression that suggests a novel means of cellular protection from HIV-1."

HBV-infected individuals have an increased risk of developing malignant lymphoma, and the HBV infection rate in lymphoma patients is significantly higher than that in the general population. However, the exact mechanism and correlation between HBV infection and lymphoma onset and progression currently remain unclear. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients with different HBV infection statuses. The results showed that the HBV infection rate was significantly higher in patients with B-cell type and late stage of NHL. The chemotherapy efficacy for NHL patients with chronic active HBV infection was significantly lower than that for the patients with chronic inactive HBV infection, the patients with HBV carriers and the patients without HBV infection. In addition, the NHL chemotherapy activated HBV replication and caused significant liver dysfunction, which could further reduce the chemotherapy efficacy. Through Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log-rank analysis, we found that the HBV infection status in NHL patients was significantly correlated with the patients' progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Compared with the patients without HBV infection (PFS: 95% CI 47.915 to 55.640; OS: 95% CI 81.324 to 86.858), the PFS and OS of the patients with chronic active HBV infection were significantly shorter (PFS: 95% CI 9.424 to 42.589, P < 0.001; OS: 95% CI 42.840 to 82.259, P = 0.006). The study demonstrated that the sustained HBV replication in patients with chronic active HBV infection could be a key factor that influences the prognosis of NHL patients after chemotherapy, and thus may provide information for designing rational clinical treatments for NHL patients with different HBV infection statuses and improve the treatment efficacy and prognosis.

17299,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The acceptance of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among patients and health care providers has had a dramatic impact on the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of many opportunistic infections associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Previously intractable opportunistic infections and syndromes are now far less common. In addition, effective antibiotic prophylactic therapies have had a profound impact on the risk of patients developing particular infections and on the incidence of these infections overall. Most notable among these are Pneumocystis carinii, disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex, tuberculosis, and toxoplasmosis. Nevertheless, infections continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality among patients who are infected with HIV. The role of HAART in many clinical situations is unquestioned. Compelling data from clinical trials support the use of these therapies during pregnancy to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV. HAART is also recommended for health care workers who have had a ""significant"" exposure to the blood of an HIV-infected patient. Both of these situations are discussed in detail in this article. In addition, although more controversial, increasing evidence supports the use of HAART during the acute HIV seroconversion syndrome. An ""immune reconstitution syndrome"" has been newly described for patients in the early phases of treatment with HAART who develop tuberculosis, M avium complex, and cytomegalovirus disease. Accumulating data support the use of hydroxyurea, an agent with a long history in the field of myeloproliferative disorders, for the treatment of HIV. Newer agents, particularly abacavir and adefovir dipivoxil, are available through expanded access protocols, and their roles are being defined and clarified."

Between September 2007 and June 2008, 256 children in the haemato-oncology unit at the Children's Welfare Teaching Hospital, Baghdad, were studied prospectively. Demographic and clinical data and vaccination history were recorded. Patients were tested for HBV at the time of diagnosis (all were negative) and after starting chemotherapy. On admission to the unit, 231 patients (90.2%) were revaccinated. At reassessment after treatment for cancer, HBV infection was found in 70 patients (27.3%). The variables that significantly increased the risk for HBV infection were a diagnosis of leukaemia and receiving more than 3 units of blood. A higher number of HBV vaccinations in hospital reduced the risk for HBV infection. The high rate of acquisition of HBV infection found in this study indicates the need for better screening of blood products and adherence to aseptic techniques in management of this group of patients."

To maximize the impact of prevention strategies, it is crucial to quantify the sources of transmission at the population level. We used viral sequence and clinical patient data from one of Europe's nationwide cohort studies to estimate probable sources of transmission for 617 recently infected MSM. Seventy-one percent of transmissions were from undiagnosed men, 6% from men who had initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART), 1% from men with no contact to care for at least 18 months, and 43% from those in their first year of infection. The lack of substantial reductions in incidence among Dutch MSM is not a result of ineffective ART provision or inadequate retention in care. In counterfactual modeling scenarios, 19% of these past cases could have been averted with current annual testing coverage and immediate ART to those testing positive. Sixty-six percent of these cases could have been averted with available antiretrovirals (immediate ART provided to all MSM testing positive, and preexposure antiretroviral prophylaxis taken by half of all who test negative for HIV), but only if half of all men at risk of transmission had tested annually. With increasing sequence coverage, molecular epidemiological analyses can be a key tool to direct HIV prevention strategies to the predominant sources of infection, and help send HIV epidemics among MSM into a decisive decline."
6287,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"In a single decade, the pandemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has become an international health, social, and economic emergency. Early and effective intervention is urgently needed for both prevention of HIV infection and for the amelioration of clinical disease. Results of therapeutic trials have suggested expanding the population for which chemotherapy is indicated. In this paper, we first review the findings from selected recent drug trials, using zidovudine and pentamidine as examples. We then discuss six issues that we believe to be crucial for future epidemiologic research in the service of vaccine and drug development: 1. To identify which complications of HIV infection most urgently require development of new therapies, we must characterize the frequency and severity of specific medical events (outcomes) in persons taking a variety of treatments. 2. Currently, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) therapeutic trials gauge the effectiveness of new therapies by their impact on such clinical parameters as the time to development of AIDS or death. These approaches take too long to provide information. We urgently need to identify surrogate markers of clinical outcome that will be useful in the early assessment of treatment efficacy. 3. Progress in vaccine development is being retarded because we do not have enough data from natural history studies on host immunologic responses to suggest that a given response is protective. We therefore need to identify natural correlates of immunity, which can help set priorities in vaccine development. 4. Discovery that a therapy works in the setting of a clinical trial is only a first step in intervention. We must also assess the impact of new therapies on the health of the public, evaluating access to health care, compliance, and other barriers to treatment. 5. Clinical trials are usually associated with the effort to prevent disease in infected persons. However, other trials are needed to assess efforts to interrupt viral transmission through use of condoms, use of virucides, and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, and by effecting specific behavioral changes. 6. Traditional methods of conducting clinical therapeutic research may not be adequate to address urgent questions in the AIDS/HIV epidemic. We must develop innovative clinical research methods, including better use of data from observational studies, to infer what we can about the effect of treatment on the clinical course."

Increasing numbers of children perinatally infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are reaching adolescence, largely because of advances in treatment over the past 10 years, but little is known about their current health status. We describe here the living conditions and clinical and immunovirologic outcomes at last evaluation among this pioneering generation of adolescents who were born before the introduction of prophylaxis for vertical transmission and whose infections were diagnosed at a time when treatment options were limited. METHODS. The eligible population consisted of HIV-1-infected children who were born before December 1993 and who were included at birth in the prospective national French Perinatal Cohort (EPF/ANRS CO10). RESULTS. Of the 348 eligible children, 210 (60%; median age, 15 years) were still alive and regularly followed up. Current treatment was highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 77% and 2 nucleoside analogues in 5.0%; 16% had stopped treatment, and 2% had never been treated. The median CD4 cell count was 557 cells/microL, and 200 cells/microL was exceeded in 94% of patients. The median viral load was 200 copies/mL. Viral load was undetectable in 43% of the adolescents and in 54.5% of those receiving HAART. Median height, weight, and body mass index were similar to French reference values for age, and school achievement was similar to nationwide statistics. Better immunologic status was associated with being younger and with having begun HAART earlier. Undetectable viral load was associated with maternal geographic origin and current HAART. CONCLUSIONS. Given the limited therapeutic options available during the early years of these patients' lives and the challenge presented by treatment adherence during adolescence, the long-term outcomes among this population are encouraging."

Public health surveillance that monitors the frequency and variety of HIV subtypes in a particular region or patient group is vital to successfully control the pandemic. We present the first comprehensive report on HIV diversity in Ireland. This study comprised all new HIV-1 diagnoses that were confirmed in the National Virus Reference Laboratory, University College Dublin, from January 2004 to December 2008. HIV 1 protease and reverse transcriptase sequences were generated using the Siemens Trugene HIV 1 Genotyping System. Subtypes were determined using web-based genotyping tools. There were 1579 new diagnoses [615 (39%) female and 964 (61%) male], of which 1060 had HIV-1 RNA specimens available for sequencing. Of sequenced samples, HIV-1 subtype B accounted for 50% overall, decreasing from 55.1% in 2004 to 49.5% in 2008. In addition, subtype B accounted for more than 80% of Irish-born individuals and more than 90% of Irish-born injection drug users and men who have sex with men. Subtype C was the second most prevalent in the overall cohort, accounting for 25%, although it accounted for only 6.1% of Irish-born individuals, with no evidence of in country transmission. The prevalence of non-subtype B HIV-1 infection in Ireland is increasing. However, these appear primarily to be imported infections not yet circulating within traditional Irish risk groups. Enhanced HIV-1 molecular epidemiology surveillance is required to monitor the spread of HIV-1, to inform future public health policy, and to ultimately control the HIV-1 epidemic in Ireland."

At May 2005, 61 patients with HBeAg negative/anti-HBe positive chronic HBV infection, followed in our viral hepatitis clinic were included to the study. The patients' ultrasonographic examination of the liver were normal, they had no history of taking alcohol or routine medication, were anti-HCV seronegative and had normal ALT levels during the last 6 months and at the beginning of the study. Serum ALT levels of patients were followed in the 3rd, 6th and 12th months of the study, and blood HBV-DNA levels were analysed quantitatively in 12th month. During the one year period 89% (54/61) of the patients yielded continously normal ALT levels, while 11% (7/61) showed at least one ALT value above the normal levels (ALT > 1.2x). Total HBV-DNA positivity rate was found as 59% (36/61). In inactive HBsAg carrier group,--namely HBeAg negative and serum ALT levels constantly normal--57.4% (31/54) of patients were HBV-DNA positive and 23 (42.6%) were negative. Amongst the HBV-DNA positive patients the viral load were detected as 10(4)-10(5) copies/ml in six (19.4%), and <10(4) copies/ml in 25 (80.6%) patients. In patients who had at least one ALT value above normal limits, 71.4% (5/7) of them were found HBV-DNA positive; two with HBV-DNA values of >10(5) copies/ml and three with values between 10(4)-10(5) copies/ml. In conclusion, although ALT levels may be normal, it should always be taken into consideration that more than half of inactive HBsAg carriers exhibited low level viral replication, thus HBV-DNA and liver enzyme levels should be monitored routinely in order not to miss the acute manifestations."

We performed a cross-sectional study among HIV-infected adults from 4 geographically diverse United States military HIV clinics to determine the prevalence of and the factors (including sexual practices) associated with MRSA colonization. Swabs were collected from the nares, throat, axillae, groin area, and perirectal area for S. aureus colonization. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, medical conditions, and sexual history were collected. Multivariate logistic regression models evaluated factors associated with carriage. We studied 550 HIV-infected adults with a median age of 42 years; 93% were male; and race/ethnicity was white for 46%, African American for 35%, and other for 19%. Median CD4 count was 529 cells/mm, 11% had a history of a MRSA infection, and 21% had a sexually transmitted infection within the last year, including 8% with syphilis. One hundred eighty (33%) were colonized with S. aureus and 22 (4%) with MRSA. The most common location for carriage was the nares, followed by the perigenital area (groin or perirectal area). Factors associated with MRSA carriage in the multivariate analyses included a sexually transmitted infection in the last year (odds ratio [OR], 4.2; p<0.01), history of MRSA infection (OR, 9.4; p<0.01), and African American compared with white race/ethnicity (OR, 3.5; p=0.01). In separate multivariate models, syphilis, nongonococcal urethritis, and public bath use were also associated with MRSA carriage (all p<0.01). In conclusion, a history of recent sexually transmitted infections, including syphilis and urethritis, was associated with MRSA carriage. These data suggest that high-risk sexual activities may play a role in MRSA transmission."

A comprehensive analysis of HCV-specific T cell responses was performed at two time points during acute HCV infection using a T cell expansion assay with overlapping peptide pools spanning the entire HCV genome Three patients with (near) normal CD4+ T cell counts (range 400-970 x 10(6)/L) either resolved (n=1) or temporary suppressed HCV RNA. In contrast, one patient with low CD4+ T cell counts (330 x 10(6)/L), had sustained high HCV RNA levels. All four patients had low HCV-specific CD8+ T cell responses, and similar magnitudes of CD4+ T cell responses. Interestingly, individuals with resolved infection or temporary suppression of HCV-RNA had HCV-specific CD4+ T cell responses predominantly against nonstructural (NS) proteins. While the individual with high HCV RNA plasma concentrations had CD4+ T cell responses predominantly directed against Core. Our data show that an acute HCV infection in an HIV-1 infected person can be suppressed in the presence of HCV-specific CD4+ T cell response targeting non-structural proteins. However further research is needed in a larger group of patients to evaluate the role of HIV-1 on HCV-specific T cell responses in relation to outcome of acute HCV infection."
18385,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"One question that continues to challenge influenza A research is why some strains of virus are so devastating compared to their more mild counterparts. We approached this question from an immunological perspective, investigating the CD8(+) T cell response in a mouse model system comparing high- and low-pathological influenza virus infections. Our findings reveal that the early (day 0 to 5) viral titer was not the determining factor in the outcome of disease. Instead, increased numbers of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells and elevated effector function on a per-cell basis were found in the low-pathological infection and correlated with reduced illness and later-time-point (day 6 to 10) viral titer. High-pathological infection was associated with increased PD-1 expression on influenza virus-specific CD8(+) T cells, and blockade of PD-L1 in vivo led to reduced virus titers and increased CD8(+) T cell numbers in high- but not low-pathological infection, though T cell functionality was not restored. These data show that high-pathological acute influenza virus infection is associated with a dysregulated CD8(+) T cell response, which is likely caused by the more highly inflamed airway microenvironment during the early days of infection. Therapeutic approaches specifically aimed at modulating innate airway inflammation may therefore promote efficient CD8(+) T cell activity. We show that during a severe influenza virus infection, one type of immune cell, the CD8 T cell, is less abundant and less functional than in a more mild infection. This dysregulated T cell phenotype correlates with a lower rate of virus clearance in the severe infection and is partially regulated by the expression of a suppressive coreceptor called PD-1. Treatment with an antibody that blocks PD-1 improves T cell functionality and increases virus clearance."
2645,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major global health issue. Only a small proportion of patients clear the virus spontaneously and the majority develop chronic hepatitis C infection. Chronic hepatitis C is one of the most common causes of advanced liver disease in the western world and is now the leading indication for liver transplantation. Unfortunately, the standard treatment, consisting of pegylated-interferon and ribavirin, is suboptimal. Less than 50% of patients infected with HCV genotype 1 are cured, treatment is costly and is associated with significant toxicity. Therefore, there has been a need to identify accurate predictors of treatment outcome to facilitate treatment decision-making. Four independent genome-wide association studies have recently confirmed an association between genetic variation in the region of the IL28B gene and treatment outcome in HCV-1 patients. Patients who carry the good response variant are two- to three-fold more likely to be cured. The difference in the frequency of the good response variant between patients of different ethnic background explains much of the recognized ethnic disparity in treatment response rates. The IL28B variants are also associated with likelihood of spontaneous clearance of HCV infection. This discovery represents a significant advance in our ability to personalize HCV therapy, as well as suggesting novel avenues for research into viral pathogenesis and therapeutic development."
2311,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"In HIV disease course, the decline of peripheral CD4 T-cell count correlates with rapid disease progression. The supply of peripheral naive T cells by the thymus requires precursor T-cell proliferation within the thymus. In the setting of HIV-1 infection, when both naive and memory T cells are progressively depleted, the contribution of thymic dysfunction in CD4 depletion needs to be studied. Previous research has shown that thymic function may also be impaired in HIV-1 infection. However, it is inconclusive regarding whether this impairment occurred at the early time or during the chronic phase. In addition, the relationship between thymic dysfunction and disease progression remains unknown. In this study, we examined the thymic function in 65 HIV-infected individuals. Among them, 17 were in acute phase, 15 were in early chronic phase, 15 were in chronic phase with no ART (antiretroviral therapy), and 18 were on ART. We also included 11 uninfected individuals as controls. We measured the peripheral blood levels of T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circles and PTK7 and CD31 expressions for the frequency of circulating recent thymic emigrants. We observed that the 2 indicators of thymic function, sj/β-TREC and PTK7, seemed to be lower in the chronic infection group than those in the acute and early chronic groups. Both indicators returned to the normal level after ART. However, after 1-year follow-up of patients with early HIV-1 infection, rapid progressors (n = 4) had lower PTK7 and CD31 expressions than chronic progressors (n = 6). "
4518,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The existence of multiple groups of HIV-1 and HIV-2 suggests that zoonotic transmissions of SIV have occurred at a low rate for centuries. Hence, an increase in the rate of human-to-human transmission may be necessary and sufficient to explain the emergence of HIV as an epidemic in the twentieth century. Three common hypotheses to explain accelerated transmission are (1) social changes accelerated sexual transmission, (2) health care changes accelerated parenteral transmission, and (3) serial passaging adapted HIV for persistent infection and sexual transmission. These hypotheses can be compared to a range of evidence. Temporal and geographic discontinuities in HIV epidemic growth are not easily explained by supposed increases in sexual transmission over time. Large historic changes in sexual transmission are hard to explain based on weak evidence associating HIV prevalence in African communities with differences in sexual behavior. On the other hand, documented iatrogenic outbreaks show high rates of parenteral transmission. The distribution of hepatitis C virus infections and the history of multiinjection treatment for trypanosomiasis in Central Africa suggest widespread parenteral transmission of blood-borne viruses during 1920-1940, coinciding in time and place with the early HIV epidemic. This suggests an important role for parenteral transmission in the early spread of HIV. Further research could improve our understanding of the early HIV epidemic."

However, despite this progress in therapeutic control, including undetectable viral loads and CD4+ T-cell counts in the normal range, viral mutations continue to accumulate in the peripheral blood compartment over time, indicating either low level reactivation and/or replication. Using patients from the Drexel Medicine CNS AIDS Research and Eradication Study (CARES) Cohort, whom have been sampled longitudinally for more than 7 years, genetic change was modeled against to the dominant integrated proviral quasispecies with respect to selection pressures such as therapeutic interventions, AIDS defining illnesses, and other factors. Phylogenetic methods based on the sequences of the LTR and tat exon 1 of the HIV-1 proviral DNA quasispecies were used to obtain an estimate of an average mutation rate of 5.3 nucleotides (nt)/kilobasepair (kb)/year (yr) prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Following ART the baseline mutation rate was reduced to an average of 1.02 nt/kb/yr. The post-ART baseline rate of genetic change, however, appears to be unique for each patient. These studies represent our initial steps in quantifying rates of genetic change among HIV-1 quasispecies using longitudinally sampled sequences from patients at different stages of disease both before and after initiation of combination ART. Notably, while long-term ART reduced the estimated mutation rates in the vast majority of patients studied, there was still measurable HIV-1 mutation even in patients with no detectable virus by standard quantitative assays. Determining the factors that affect HIV-1 mutation rates in the peripheral blood may lead to elucidation of the mechanisms associated with changes in HIV-1 disease severity."
9385,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The aim of this review is to summarize the safety profile of the five approved oral nucleoside analogs used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, focusing on both the class adverse effects and those that have been reported with individual agents, as well as their safety in pregnancy. All nucleoside analogs have a ""Black Box"" warning because of their potential for inhibition of human DNA polymerase gamma involved in mitochondrial DNA replication. A reduction in intracellular mitochondrial DNA levels can lead to varying clinical manifestations of mitochondrial toxicity (i.e., neuropathy, myopathy, lactic acidosis), but these side effects are rarely reported with the oral antiviral agents active against HBV. Adefovir and tenofovir are associated with a dose-dependent but usually reversible proximal renal tubular toxicity. For these reasons, patients receiving these agents should be monitored for renal toxicity and the dose modified for renal insufficiency. Prolonged use of tenofovir has also been reported to lead to reduced bone mineral density in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, but prospective studies in patients with HBV infection are lacking. Telbivudine treatment is associated with moderate serum creatine phosphokinase elevations in up to 12% of patients. There have been few prospective studies on the safety of nucleoside analogs during pregnancy. According to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry, the incidence of birth defects associated with lamivudine and tenofovir use during pregnancy is not increased. Studies on the safety of long-term therapy with the nucleoside analogs, alone and in combination, are needed as are further studies of children, the elderly, pregnant women, and patients with renal insufficiency."

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between IL28B polymorphism and responses to therapy in patients infected with genotype 2. One hundred twenty-nine chronic hepatitis C patients infected with genotype 2, 77 patients with genotype 2a and 52 patients with genotype 2b, were analyzed. Clinical and laboratory parameters, including genetic variation near the IL28B gene (rs8099917), were assessed. Drug adherence was monitored in each patient. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses of these parameters and clinical responses were carried out. Univariate analyses showed that a sustained virological response was correlated significantly with IL28B polymorphism, as well as age, white blood cell and neutrophil counts, adherence to RBV, and rapid virological response. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients infected with genotype 2b achieved significantly lower rapid virological response rates than those with genotype 2a. Patients with the IL28B-major allele showed higher virus clearance rates at each time point than those with the IL28B-minor allele, and the differences were more profound in patients infected with genotype 2b than those with genotype 2a. Furthermore, both rapid and sustained virological responses were associated significantly with IL28B alleles in patients with genotype 2b. IL28B polymorphism was predictive of PEG-IFN plus RBV combination treatment outcomes in patients infected with genotype 2 and, especially, with genotype 2b. In conclusion, IL-28B polymorphism affects responses to PEG-IFN-based treatment in difficult-to-treat HCV patients."

The patients received daily oral ribavirin (1,000-1,200 mg according to body weight) plus 5 million units (MU) IFN-alpha2b three times a week for 12 months and were followed-up for 12 months. The median viremia level decreased significantly at the end of treatment (1.2 x 10(3) copies/mL) and follow-up (4.0 x 10(2) copies/mL) compared with the baseline (3.0 x 10(6) copies/mL; P <.05). After 12 months, 8 of 24 (33%) patients had cleared HBV DNA and 12 (50%) had normal ALT levels. At the end of the study virological and biochemical response was 50% and 21%, respectively. Thus, virological and biochemical response sustained in 5 of 24 (21%) patients retreated with ribavirin and IFN-alpha; none of them lost hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Liver histology improved in 2 of 4 sustained responders but in none of the 12 nonresponders with paired biopsies (P =.05). The response was independent of dose and duration of previous treatment, viral load, or the distribution of HBV precore wild-type/mutant variants. However, sustained responders had significantly higher necroinflammation (P =.036) and fibrosis (P =.007) scores. IFN-alpha-related side effects were mild and reversible on discontinuation. In 4 (17%) patients who suffered nausea and diarrhea the ribavirin dosage was reduced by 50% after 1 month of therapy and finally discontinued in all of them. No patient had liver disease decompensation. In summary, combination therapy with ribavirin and IFN-alpha may be efficacious to treat viremic anti-HBe-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B who have failed previous IFN therapy."

The study was performed in a pediatric and perinatal HIV clinic in a tertiary general hospital. Forty-three HIV positive children from the age group of 5 months to 14 years were started on antiretroviral therapy ART. Thirteen patients (30%) had adverse effects related to the ART. Seven patients (16%) had hepatotoxicity, 5 patients (12%) had raised serum amylase without symptomatic pancreatitis, 5 patients (12%) had zidovudine AZT induced anemia, 4 patients (9%) had Nevirapine NVP induced rash, 1 patient (2%) had Didanosine ddI induced pain in abdomen, 1 patient (2%) had Stavudine d4T induced angioedema, and 1 patient (2%) had hepatic steatosis. Five patients (71%) with hepatotoxicity responded to dose adjustment of ART whereas in 2 patients (29%), the elevated liver enzymes resolved on its own. Two patients (40%) with AZT induced anemia required omission of AZT and remaining 3 patients (60%) responded to dosage adjustment. ddI induced abdominal pain, d4T induced angioedema and hepatic steatosis resolved on omitting the respective antiretroviral drug. NVP induced rash and raised serum amylase subsided without any intervention. Hepatotoxicity was seen at higher viral load (Mean = 118608 copies/ml) whereas elevated serum amylase was seen at lower viral load (mean = 37631 copies/ml), which was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). NVP induced rash was seen in early weeks of therapy, serum amylase abnormalities were seen at a mean interval of 0.9 years after starting therapy, hepatotoxicity was seen at a mean interval of 1.7 years and AZT induced anemia was seen at a mean interval of 2.0 years after starting therapy. Adverse effects with antiretroviral drugs in HIV-infected children are quite common. Hepatotoxicity is the commonest adverse effect noted followed by elevated serum amylase and zidovudine induced anemia. Hepatotoxicity is seen at higher viral load as compared to other adverse effects. Most of the adverse effects are reversible on dosage modification or omitting the offending drug."

This cross-sectional study reports the prevalence of overweight and obesity, and sociodemographic, psychological, and substance use-related risk factors for elevated body mass index (BMI) among 2157 HIV-seropositive (HIV+) in comparison to 730 HIV-seronegative (HIV-) participants in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). Separate univariable and multivariate linear regression analyses were completed for HIV+ and HIV- women. Our study revealed a similar proportion of obesity (body mass index [BMI] >or=30) among HIV+ (33%) and HIV- women (29%) (p = 0.12), as well as comparable median BMI (HIV+: 26.1 versus HIV-: 26.7, p = 0.16). HIV+ compared to HIV- women, respectively, were significantly (p < 0.01) older (median = 35.6 versus. 32.5), but similar (p = 0.97) by race/ethnicity (57% African American, 28% Hispanic, and 15% white for both). In multivariate models for both HIV+ and HIV- women, African American race/ethnicity was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with higher BMI, while higher quality of life score and illicit hard drug use were associated with lower BMI. Additionally, smoking, alcohol use, markers of advanced HIV infection (AIDS diagnosis, elevated HIV viral load, low CD4 count), and a history of antiretroviral therapy use (ART) were also associated with lower BMI among HIV+ women. In conclusion, risk factors for elevated BMI were similar for HIV+ and HIV- women in the WIHS. For HIV+ women, all markers of advanced HIV infection and ART use were additionally associated with lower BMI."

In this study we assessed whether 1,25D could improve the maturation defect we have previously demonstrated in monocytes from AIDS patients. In vitro growth and maturation of monocytes from 10 controls, 15 asymptomatic HIV positives (CDC group II or III) and 13 symptomatic HIV positives (CDC group IV) was examined by assessing cellular morphology, differentiation, adherence and protein content. Cells were cultured for 10 days with or without addition of 1,25D at a concentration of 100 pg/ml. In addition, patients were monitored clinically and by immunological parameters and HIV p24 antigen in serum. The present study showed that addition of 1,25D significantly improved the growth and maturation in both patient and control groups. There was a significant negative correlation between response to 1,25D and CD4+ lymphocyte count in blood in HIV-infected patients. A greater response to 1,25D was seen in monocytes from patients with advanced immunodeficiency and symptomatic disease than in monocytes from asymptomatic patients. However, in the most advanced cases of HIV infection with serious ongoing opportunistic infections the response to 1,25D was very poor, possibly reflecting profound and incorrigible dysfunction of monocytes."

We considered active autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA) as a decrease of at least 2 g/dL in hemoglobin levels, an increase of at least 0.6 mg/dL in the serum unconjugated bilirubin level, a reticulocyte count >5%, and a positive direct Coombs test. Severe neutropenia was defined as a neutrophil count <0.5 x 10(9)/L, and severe thrombocytopenia as a platelet count <30 x 10(9)/L. We identified the following cytopenias: AHA (17 cases), severe thrombocytopenia (16 cases), aplastic anemia (2 cases), severe neutropenia (1 case), refractory sideroblastic anemia (1 case), and pure red cell aplasia (1 case). Three patients simultaneously presented 2 types of severe cytopenias. Twenty-seven patients (77%) were female and 8 (23%) male, with a mean age at diagnosis of cytopenia of 51.7 years (range, 18-84 yr). Immunologic markers were detected in 19 (68%) of 28 patients, the most frequent being hypocomplementemia in 16 (57%), cryoglobulins in 15 (54%), antinuclear antibodies in 12 (43%), and rheumatoid factor in 5 (18%). Other associated processes were autoimmune diseases in 14 (50%) of 28 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection in 3 (9%) of 32. We found clinical and immunologic differences between HCV patients with AHA and those with severe thrombocytopenia. Patients with HCV-related AHA showed a higher prevalence of associated autoimmune diseases (71%), cryoglobulins (67%), and cirrhosis (59%). All had a good response to corticosteroids, but a poor prognosis (47% mortality). In contrast, patients with HCV-related severe thrombocytopenia had a lower prevalence of associated autoimmune diseases (11%), a poorer response to corticosteroids (55%), and lower mortality (6%), with HIV/HBV coinfections in some patients. The 35 cases presented demonstrate that different types of immune-mediated cytopenias may be severe and clinically significant in patients with HCV infection. Hemolytic anemia and severe thrombocytopenia were the most frequent cytopenias observed. Most patients responded well to corticosteroids, although a higher rate of mortality was observed in those with liver cirrhosis."

The mean age of these patients was 38 years, range: 25-62 years. All patients studied were in the advanced stage of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) with a mean circulatory CD4 lymphocyte count of 21/microL (range: 0-64/microL) and a much higher HIV viral load at initial diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection. Because of no significant difference in the HIV viral load between patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis and those with extrapulmonary tuberculosis in this study, dissemination of M. tuberculosis did not correlate directly with a high HIV viral load, but was possibly related to the virulence of the organism itself. Chest radiographic findings at initial diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis were variable and atypical. Most patients (62.5%) presented with a primary pattern (lower lobe or diffuse infiltrates), while hilar lymphadenopathy was noted in more than half of the patients and cavitation was less common (only one patient). Ten patients (83.3%) had extrapulmonary involvement; the most common site being the lymph nodes. Most patients with classic drug-sensitive tuberculosis responded well to conventional standard regimens of anti-tuberculosis therapy. Since tuberculosis is transmittable, treatable, and possibly preventable, moreover the clinical presentation of tuberculosis in the patients with AIDS may be atypical and unusual, clinical physicians must keep an alert dealing with these patients for early identification and early treatment."

The objective of this study was to analyze associations of HCV, HIV, and combination antiretroviral therapy with lipid levels and C-reactive protein (CRP) among older men. We measured fasting total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride, and high-sensitivity CRP serum levels in a cross-sectional study of 108 HIV-infected and 74 HIV-uninfected at-risk older men. One hundred ten men (60%) had detectable HCV RNA, with no difference by HIV status (p = 0.25). The majority (88%) of men with HCV infection had a history of injection drug use. Among all men, HCV infection was independently associated with lower total cholesterol (p < 0.001), LDL-C (p < 0.001), triglycerides (p = 0.01), and CRP (p = 0.001). Among HIV-infected men, HCV infection was associated with lower total cholesterol (p < 0.001), LDL-C (p < 0.001), and CRP (p = 0.004). HCV infection was associated with lower triglycerides among men on protease inhibitors (PI) (p = 0.02) and non-PI combination antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.02), but not among antiretroviral-naïve men. These findings demonstrate an association of lower serum lipid and CRP levels with HCV infection and suggest that HCV status should be assessed as an important correlate of cardiovascular risk factors in studies of older men with or at risk for HIV."

Thirty (16.8%) of 178 patients were HCV-infected; among them, 5 had partial or full seroreversion. Seroreversion to an anti-HCV-negative state is characterized by a quantitative decrease in antibody. A seroreversion may be observed in three circumstances: spontaneously, induced by therapy, and in conjunction with human immunodeficiency virus infection.

To study this emerging infection in MSM in Antwerp, Belgium, we reviewed all cases of newly acquired HCV infection in HIV-positive MSM followed from 2001 to 2009 at the HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI)reference clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp. Newly acquired HCV infection was considered as certain or probable according to local definitions. During the study period, 69 episodes of newly acquired HCV infection (40 certain and 29 probable) were diagnosed in 67 HIV-infected MSM. In only 10 episodes (14%) were the patients symptomatic. The annual incidence of HCV infection in our population of HIV-infected MSM rose steadily from 0.2% in 2001 to 1.51% in 2008, and then peaked to 2.9% in 2009. For 60 episodes (87%), another STI (mainly syphilis and lymphogranuloma venereum) had been diagnosed within the six months before the diagnosis of HCV infection. All but one patient with available genotyping (n=54) were found to be infected with the difficult to-treat HCV genotypes 1 or 4. Our results therefore demonstrate the rising incidence of HCV infection in HIV-positive MSM in Antwerp, since 2001, which reached an alarming level in 2009. Targeted awareness campaigns and routine screening are urgently needed to limit further HCV spread and its expected long-term consequences."

We therefore developed an internally controlled real-time reverse transcriptase-initiated PCR assay that quantifies HIV-1 RNA concentrations down to 1 copy per ml of plasma. This assay with single-copy sensitivity (the single-copy assay) generates a reproducible linear regression plot of input copy number versus threshold cycle by using HIV-1 RNA transcripts at copy numbers ranging from 1 to 10(6) per reaction mixture. The single-copy assay was compared to the ultrasensitive AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR assay and a more sensitive modification of the ultrasensitive assay by repeatedly testing a low-copy-number panel containing 200 to 0.781 copies of HIV-1 RNA per ml of plasma. This comparison showed that the single-copy assay had a greater sensitivity than the other assays and was the only assay that detected HIV-1 RNA at levels as low as 0.781 copies/ml. Testing of plasma samples from 15 patients who were receiving antiretroviral therapy and who had <75 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml revealed persistent viremia in all 15 patients, with HIV-1 RNA levels ranging from 1 to 32 copies/ml (median, 13 copies/ml). The greater sensitivity of the single-copy assay should allow better characterization of persistent viremia in patients who are receiving antiretroviral therapy and whose HIV-1 RNA levels are suppressed to below the detection limits of present assays."

A total of 432 patients were examined. HIV-related NCI was diagnosed in 238 patients (55.1%), meeting the HIV dementia (HIV-D) criteria in 45 (10.4%). The prevalence of both NCI and HIV-D did not change significantly during the study period. Compared with patients without NCI, patients with NCI were older (40.4 versus 38.2 years; P = .003), had a higher prevalence of positive HCV serology (61.1% versus 38.9%; P = .003), and a lower nadir CD4 cell count (156 versus 222 cells/microl; P < .001). Compared with patients seen during 1996 to 1999, patients with NCI seen during 2000 to 2002 were older (40.7 versus 38.8 years; P = .004), had a less advanced disease stage (previous acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] 28.8% versus 65.7%; P < .001) and a higher nadir CD4 count (174 versus 132 cells/microl; P = .026). This study showed an unchanged prevalence of both HIV-related NCI and HIV-D in the period 1996 to 2002. The authors found evidences for new additional potential risk factors for HIV-related NCI (older age, lower nadir CD4 count, positive hepatitis C virus [HCV] serology), and for a change of risk factors for NCI in the late highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era (older age, less advanced disease, higher nadir CD4 count)."

A total of 417 patients with histologically documented chronic hepatitis B (histologic activity index [HAI] 9.5-11.0) received famciclovir (500 mg 3 times daily or 1.5 g once daily) or placebo. Famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily significantly reduced HBV DNA and median HAI scores versus placebo. By week 8, median HBV DNA decreased from 1,645 to 283 MEq/mL (famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily) and from 1,147 to 304 MEq/mL (famciclovir 1.5 g once daily), while increasing for placebo (1,617 to 1,685 MEq/mL). Median change in HBV DNA at the end of therapy was -76% (famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily; P <.01) and -60% (famciclovir 1.5 g once daily; P =.25) versus -37% for placebo. Median change in HAI was -1.5 points (famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily; P =.02) and -1.0 point (famciclovir 1.5 g once daily; P =.35) and zero for placebo. Fifty percent of patients receiving famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily (P =.07) and 43% receiving 1.5 g once daily (P =.41) experienced >/=2 points improvement in HAI versus 37% for placebo. Nine percent of patients treated with famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily underwent anti-HBeAg seroconversion with undetectable HBV DNA at end of follow-up versus 3% in the placebo group (P =.05). Famciclovir was well tolerated; the incidence of post-treatment alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations was comparable with placebo. In conclusion, famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily gave modest suppression of viral replication, but translated into significant histologic improvement in median HAI score at 1 year."
7494,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"HIV was first described in Kenya in 1984-1985. Currently, Kenya has an estimated HIV-1 prevalence of 6.2%. With the introduction of antiretroviral drugs, the survival of most HIV patients has been prolonged markedly. However, this is greatly threatened by increasing rates of antiretroviral dug resistance, which may eventually lead to suboptimal treatment outcomes. The objective of this study was to characterize currently occurring antiretroviral drug resistance mutations among drug-naive patients visiting two referral hospitals in Kenya. Using polymerase chain reaction, the HIV protease gene was amplified from blood samples of 63 study participants. The sequences were used to determine HIV-1 subtype and presence/prevalence of mutations associated with resistance to protease inhibitors. Finally, the protease gene was variably measured using Shannon entropy analysis. Analysis of frequency of HIV-1 subtypes revealed subtype A to be the predominant subtype, while the analysis of drug resistance mutations revealed the presence of four minor drug resistance mutations associated weakly with resistance to protease inhibitors. Among these mutations, L33I was the most prevalent mutation. Shannon entropy analysis revealed high genomic variability, especially in region spanning nucleotides 1-55, 113-170, and 205-240. This study warrants the need for dedicated efforts to improve compliance to antiretroviral therapy and reduce transmitted resistance rates, which will greatly ensure the therapeutic efficacy of antiretroviral drugs.

The Central California Valley is home to a huge Hmong population. To date, the true prevalence of HBV among Hmong is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to contribute to the limited data on HBV prevalence and its trends in Hmong population in the Central California Valley. Between fiscal years 2006 and 2010, a total of 219, 450 voluntary donors were identified at Central California Blood Center in Fresno. Of these, 821 (399 males and 422 females) were Hmong donors. A cross-sectional review of the HBV (hepatitis B surface antigen) positivity among all donors was carried out. Prevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Ninety-two percent of Hmong donors were between age groups 16 and 35 years, and only 8% were ≥36 years. The overall prevalence in Hmong was noted at 3.41% (95%CI 2.3-4.9) compared to 0.06% (95%CI 0.05-0.07) in donors of all ethnicities. The calculated prevalence could be an underestimate of the true HBV prevalence in Hmong as the study enrolled only healthy blood donors with predominant younger age (≤35 years) population. These results underscore the persistent burden of HBV infection and potentially increased risk of premature death even in the second generation Hmong community of the Central California Valley. This study reemphasizes the unequivocal need to develop robust preventive and treatment strategies for HBV in Hmong community."

They were prospectively included in a study, in 2009, to assess their virological status and prevalence of antiretroviral drug-resistance mutations in cases of virological failure, according to revised 2010 WHO criteria (e.g., HIV-1 RNA >3.7 log(10) copies/ml). Detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA was observed in 53% of children under first-line treatment, and virological failure was diagnosed in 40%, which was associated in 85% of cases with viruses harboring at least one drug-resistance mutation to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), and in 36% of cases with at least one major drug-resistance mutation to NRTI or NNRTI when excluding the M184V mutation. Overall, the proportion of children receiving a first-line regimen for a median of 18 months with virological failure associated with drug-resistance mutations, and thus eligible for a second-line treatment, was estimated at 34% of the whole cohort. In children under second-/third-line therapy, virological failure occurred in 47%, plus at least one major drug-resistance mutation to NRTI or NNRTI, though less commonly to protease inhibitors. Taken together, these findings argue in favor of the urgent need to improve distribution of pediatric antiretroviral drugs in the Central African Republic, to increase adherence by treated children, and to offer adequate HIV biological monitoring."

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate showed activity against both wild type and lamivudine resistant HBV in HIV-HBV co-infected patients. In order to compare the efficacy of lamivudine/tenofovir treatment we investigated detailed HBV kinetics in 13 HIV-HBV co-infected patients with either wild type HBV or lamivudine resistant HBV. The viral strains in both patient groups showed a biphasic viral decline pattern. Only in the first phase of viral decay, which reflects the clearance rate of the free virus from plasma, there was a statistically significant response in favor of the wild type group. After the first phase we observed a similar viral decline till 24 weeks of both groups. This is reassuring for many pretreated co-infected patients harbouring mutant viruses."

PIs naive patients receiving their first highly active antiretroviral therapy were included if their CD4 cell count was lower than 200/mm3 and their HIV viral load (VL) >100,000 RNA copies/mL. Every patient received two analogues and was randomized in two groups receiving either one PI (saquinavir soft gel capsule) or two PIs (saquinavir + nelfinavir). Viral efficacy (VL <50), time to reach VL <50, viral clearance rate constant and plasmatic elimination half-life were determined. In all, 30 patients were enrolled. No viral variable was significatively improved by the four-drug combination in the short term. No clinical benefit should be expected with a four-drug (two PIs) regimen in patients with low CD4+ cell count and high VL."

It has been demonstrated that alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) can significantly enhance the expression of A3G in human primary resting CD4(+) T-cells, macrophages and primary hepatocytes, subsequently decreasing their viral susceptibility. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are key effectors in innate host immunity, mediating adaptive immune responses and stimulating IFN-alpha production in reaction to various stimuli. In this report, we demonstrate that IFN-alpha, either exogenously added to- or endogenously secreted by pDCs, can enhance the expression of A3G and its family members such as A3A, A3C and A3F. We have also shown that IFN-alpha can inhibit HIV-1 expression in pDCs. This inhibitory effect could be countered by addition of an A3G-specific short interfering RNA, indicating that IFN-alpha-induced A3G plays a key role in mediating pDCs response to HIV-1. Given the central role played by pDCs in orchestrating the IFN-alpha/A3G intercellular network and intracellular signal pathway, our data indicate that pDCs themselves are also protected by an IFN-alpha/A3G-mediated innate immunity barrier from HIV-1 infection."

Topical dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) therapy has been associated with improved clinical and immunologic parameters in HIV-infected patients. We have now examined the effect of topical DNCB treatment on plasma HIV RNA levels in a small prospective study. Eight HIV-infected subjects had T-cell counts and plasma viral load measured prior to initiation of DNCB therapy and 3-4 months after starting treatment. Six patients who refused DNCB therapy served as simultaneous controls. The mean CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts did not change significantly in either group over the study period. In contrast, plasma HIV RNA levels decreased one-half to greater than one log in each DNCB-treated subject, and the decrease in viral copies was statistically significant (p = 0.006). In the control group, plasma HIV RNA levels increased significantly over the course of the study (p = 0.037). We conclude that topical DNCB therapy has the ability to lower viral load in HIV-infected patients. The long-term effect on viral burden of this inexpensive, readily available therapeutic modality merits further investigation."

Co-infection with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an important prognostic factor and associated with more frequent and accelerated progression to cirrhosis. Until recently HIV/AIDS-related complications were life limiting in patients co-infected with HCV; the introduction of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) and the better prognosis of HIV infection has made HCV-related complications an emerging health problem in HCV/HIV coinfected individuals. Treatment of chronic HCV infection has also evolved since the introduction of interferon-alpha. Recently, introduction of pegylated interferon-alpha (peginterferon-alpha) has resulted in an increase in sustained virus clearance rates of up to 80% in selected genotypes and patient populations. The safety and efficacy of modern anti HCV treatment regimens - based on peginterferon-alpha in combination with ribavirin - was evaluated in 4 controlled trials. Sustained clearance of hepatitis C virus can be achieved in up to 35% of patients with HIV/HCV co-infection, and novel HCV treatment regimens based on peginterferon-alpha have no negative effect on the control of HIV disease. In conclusion, if HIV infection is well controlled and CD4+ cell counts >100/mm3, treatment of chronic hepatitis C with peginterferon in combination with ribavirin is safe and should be given for 48 weeks regardless of the HCV genotype. Introduction of peginterferon-alpha has significantly improved adherence to treatment and treatment efficacy; in particular sustained virologic response in patients with HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection improved, but sustained viral clearance in only 7%-38% of patients infected with genotype I and 4 cannot be the final step in development of effective treatments in patients with HCV/HIV co-infection."

Pertussis toxin, which inactivates several members of the G protein family of signaling components, including Gi, Go, and transducin, was found to inhibit either TPA or TNF-alpha induction of HIV-1 in U1 cells at the concentration of 1-10 ng/ml. Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) assay revealed that pertussis toxin could inhibit HIV-1 gene expression. B-oligomer, the mitogenic and non-ADP-ribosylating component of pertussis toxin, did not show any effect on HIV-1 replication alone or in combination with TNF in the same concentration range. It was of particular interest to note that a single protein (Gi) with a molecular weight of 40 kDa was dose-dependently ADP-ribosylated after treatment with pertussis toxin in U1 cells. The degree of ADP ribosylation of Gi corresponded well to that of inhibition of HIV-1 upon treatment with pertussis toxin. These results strongly support the contention that TPA and TNF-alpha induction of HIV-1 is mediated by a Gi-like receptor-effector coupling protein in the membrane of U1 cells. On the basis of these findings, we propose a model for signal transduction of HIV-1 expression through c-kinase-dependent (TPA) and c-kinase-independent (TNF-alpha) pathways in the U1 cell to determine the point at which Gi-like protein is involved."

The antiviral activity and efficacy of ETR against HIV-1 subtypes B and non-B were further investigated. The effect of HIV-1 subtype on ETR fold change in EC(50) value (FC) was analyzed in HIV-1 recombinant clinical isolates from 673 treatment-naive patients enrolled in other Tibotec studies. Subgroup analyses from the DUET studies of the effect of HIV-1 subtype on the proportion of patients with viral load (VL) <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml were also conducted using pooled week 48 data. Genotype/subtype and phenotype determinations were performed using the vircoTYPE HIV-1 and Antivirogram assays, respectively. In vitro results from treatment-naive patients indicated comparable median ETR FC in virus isolates from patients infected with subtype B or non-B (1.1 vs. 1.2, respectively). HIV-1 subtype data were available for 594 and 595 patients in the ETR and placebo groups of the DUET studies, respectively; 94% of patients harbored subtype B. Baseline characteristics were similar across the different subtypes, with the exception of a higher number of sensitive NRTIs used in patients with subtype non-B. At week 48, virological responses in the ETR group were higher in patients with subtype non-B versus B (73% vs. 60%, respectively). ETR was equally effective in suppressing viral replication in patients infected with HIV-1 subtype B or various HIV-1 non-B subtypes."

To better understand the refractoriness of monocytes to alterations in levels of CD4 mRNA, we treated HIV-IIIB chronically infected U-937 cells with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a known stimulus of HIV gene expression. Although PMA caused a significant increase in HIV mRNA levels that was sustained over 7 days, no effect on CD4 transcript levels was noted. Clonal derivatives of HIV-IIIB-infected U-937 cells, which produced a variety of infectious and defective particles, were likewise not affected in ability to produce CD4 mRNA. To rule out the possibility that U-937 cells select out HIV-1 variants unable to modulate CD4 mRNA levels, we passaged infectious virus from a U-937 clonal derivative (UHC1) onto different monocytic and T lymphocytic cell lines. In monocytic cell lines (U-937, PLB-985, THP-1), we observed an avirulent infection that did not affect CD4 mRNA levels, whereas UHC1 infection of each of two T lymphocytic cell lines (CEM-T4, Jurkat) caused both cytopathic replication and reductions in CD4 mRNA levels. In one case (Jurkat), variants expressing low CD4 mRNA may have emerged, because the outgrowth no longer expressed viral products. In the other case (CEM-T4), high expression of viral genes was accompanied by CD4 mRNA down-modulation, suggesting either that low-CD4-expressing variants were selected that maintained viral gene expression or that CD4 gene expression was repressed by viral products."

The lengths of several env regions of HIV-1 proviral DNA differed markedly when obtained from different organs of an individual. Nucleotide sequences of the hypervariable V3 region of HIV-1 obtained from different organs of one patient demonstrated distinct viral variants. Most proviral DNA sequences found in organs were also present in viral RNA obtained from plasma. The majority of HIV-1 V3 variants present in the lymph tissue could be found in the plasma viral population obtained at autopsy and in the sequential blood samples obtained before death, but were absent from the cardiac blood provirus population obtained at autopsy. However, sequence variants found in the brain proviral DNA were not detected in either plasma or the sequential blood samples. Sequence differences were observed at the apex of the V3 loop between HIV-1 variants present in sequential blood samples and in blood lymphocytes and nervous tissue, lymph tissue and plasma obtained post-mortem. The potential effect of lymph tissue on the long-term persistence of different viral variants is discussed. Virus obtained from the two sequential blood samples produced syncytia in primary cultures and was easily transmitted to the continuous JM cell line. Consensus (majority) V3 loop sequences determined for the adapted viruses demonstrated that some, but not all, sequences were represented within the in vivo viral population."

With advances in HIV treatment, an increasing number of those with PAH are reaching childbearing age and becoming pregnant. Depression may be an important and common factor that complicates both treatment and pregnancy outcomes in this group. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in pregnant patients with PAH to determine if history of depression is associated with nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We reviewed charts of women with PAH receiving prenatal care at a single institution from March 1995 to December 2012. ART nonadherence was measured by patient self-report of any missed doses in the third trimester. Demographic, obstetric, and HIV infection characteristics of patients with a history of depression (dPAH) were compared to patients without a history of depression. Nine pregnancies among 6 dPAH women and 14 pregnancies among 12 PAH women without a history of depression were identified. None of the dPAH women reported 100% adherence to ART in the third trimester while 57% of women without a history of depression reported strict adherence (p = 0.04). The mean HIV RNA level at delivery was higher among dPAH women (17,399 vs. 2966 copies/Ml; p = 0.03) and fewer reached an undetectable HIV RNA level (<400 copies/mL) at delivery (p = 0.03). We concluded that a history of depression may contribute to poor medication adherence and treatment outcomes among pregnant women with PAH. Focused attention on diagnosis and treatment of depression in the preconception period may lead to more optimal medication adherence. "

In a multivariate analysis of a cohort of 5832 individuals, we found that individuals coinfected with HCV and HIV-1 (prevalence of coinfection, 5.8%) had a CD4+ cell count that decreased at a rate similar to that for individuals infected with HIV-1 alone. However, coinfection was associated with a statistically significant increased likelihood of onset of an acquired immunodeficiency syndromedefining illness or developing a CD4+ cell count of <200 cells/mm3, compared with infection with HIV-1 alone (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.072.17). Patients who were naive to highly active antiretroviral therapy were significantly less likely to progress to either end point, because of their higher CD4+ cell counts.

In both HIV-infected and uninfected persons, sustained virologic response (SVR) rates are higher for genotype 2 and genotype 3 HCV infection and for patients with lower pre-treatment HCV RNA levels. HIV-infection does not alter either the reality that persons who fail to achieve a 2log(10) reduction in HCV RNA level after 12 weeks of therapy rarely achieve a SVR, or the theoretical benefits of maintenance therapy in those without viral responses. The same adverse treatment effects can occur in HIV-infected and uninfected persons, but treatment of HIV-infected persons is complicated by interactions between ribavirin and antiretroviral medications and effects of HCV treatment on the course of HIV. The optimal treatment doses and durations are not known for HIV-infected persons, who are also less likely to achieve a SVR. A final difference is that the benefits of HCV treatment breakthroughs are usually realized in patients without HIV years before those with HIV. Future research must focus both on improving outcomes with currently available medications and rapidly evaluating the safety and efficacy of forthcoming antiviral compounds in HIV/HCV coinfected persons."

We conducted a study to determine whether infection with either the hepatitis C virus or the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were significant risk factors for the development of DIH in patients receiving antituberculosis therapy. Our study consisted of two parts. In the first part, 134 consecutive patients admitted for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) were followed for the development of DIH. All of these patients were also screened for the presence of hepatitis C and HIV. In the second part of the study, those patients who were hepatitis C positive and who developed DIH on repeated reintroduction of the anti-TB drugs were offered a liver biopsy. If active inflammation, which may be suggestive of hepatitis C infection, was present on the biopsy specimen, treatment with alpha-interferon was begun and the anti-TB drugs were subsequently reintroduced. During the 18 mo of the study, 22 patients developed DIH. The relative risk of developing DIH if the patient was hepatitis C or HIV positive was fivefold and fourfold, respectively (p < 0.05). If a patient was coinfected with both hepatitis C and HIV the relative risk of developing DIH was increased 14.4-fold (p < 0.002). In the treatment part, four patients were treated with alpha-interferon, and all were able to undergo the reintroduction of anti-TB therapy without reoccurrence of DIH. Infection with hepatitis C and HIV are independent and additive risk factors for the development of DIH during TB therapy. The treatment of hepatitis C with alpha-interferon may allow the reintroduction of anti-TB agents in those who previously developed DIH when exposed to these drugs."

All patients were clinically stable at the time of entry into the study. Each received 10 micrograms/kg of methionine-enkephalin in an intravenous infusion three times weekly for up to 12 weeks. Evaluation of cellular immunity (T-cell subsets, in vitro interleukin-2 production and interleukin-2 receptor expression, T-cell responses to mitogens and antigens, and delayed-hypersensitivity skin tests) as well as clinical and toxicity monitoring was performed prior to treatment, at 2-week intervals during treatment, and after the cessation of treatment. Increases in interleukin-2 receptor expression were seen on lymphocytes collected on one occasion from each of two patients 30 min postinfusion. Studies done 24 hr after infusions revealed increases in interleukin-2 production in one patient, but when pre- and posttreatment values were compared there were no significant changes in numbers of circulating T cells of any phenotype or in T-cell responses to mitogens or antigens. None of the patients with Kaposi's sarcoma had regression of tumor; one patient dropped out of the study at week 5 because of deteriorating clinical status and progression of tumor. There were no adverse reactions or evidence of toxicity. We conclude that methionine-enkephalin appears to enhance temporarily selected immune responses in patients with HIV infection, however, in the schedule used in this study it was not clinically efficacious."

One (0.9%) adolescent was diagnosed with abdominal obesity based on waist circumference measurement; three (2.5%) adolescents were obese based on subscapular skinfold thickness. According to the body mass index, the population studied was mainly eutrophic. The prevalence of fat redistribution, a characteristic of patients with HIV/AIDS under HAART, was low.

A comparative, retrospective clinical cohort study included patients with plasma viral load (VL) <50 copies/ml and CD4 cell count >500 cells/mm(3) who interrupted HAART. Fifteen patients interrupted HAART after six 2-weeks-off-/4-weeks-on therapy cycles (STI group) and 30 subjects discontinued HAART without previous STIs (NSTI group). The criteria for treatment resumption were development of AIDS-defining clinical events, VL >100,000 copies/ml or CD4 <350 cells/mm(3). Median (IQR) time off therapy was 48 (29-56) weeks in the STI group and 31 (8-77) weeks in the NSTI group (p < 0.15). After 48 weeks, 46% of the patients in the STI group and 40% in the NSTI group remained off HAART (p < 0.74). No patient developed AIDS-defining events and all but one achieved virological control after treatment resumption. The CD4 nadir was 341 (298-464) cells/mm(3) among patients who reinitiated HAART and 560 (364-682) cells/mm(3) in those who remained off therapy by week 48 (p <0.01). Likewise, CD4 count prior to treatment interruption was 902 (806-1040) cells/mm(3) and 1123 (924-1234) cells/mm(3) in subjects resuming and remaining off HAART, respectively (p = 0.03). No relationship between treatment resumption and pre-ART VL or with the time with undetectable VL before enrollment was found. CD4 nadir was a significant predictor for treatment reinitiation in a multivariate analysis. Previous STIs do not influence time off therapy when HAART is definitively discontinued in chronically HIV-infected subjects. CD4 nadir is an important factor in the treatment discontinuation decision."

However, there clearly is an association between long-term infection with HIV and metabolic abnormalities. HIV-infected adults should undergo evaluation and treatment based on the NCEP ATP III guidelines. The NCEP recommends non-pharmacologic interventions be given a thorough trial prior to consideration of drug therapy. The recommendations also stipulate that intensive therapy with lipid-lowering medications should be used in individuals with metabolic syndrome. This includes aggressive treatment of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. The NCEP also emphasizes the importance of smoking cessation, weight reduction, increased physical activity, and a salubrious diet.

Poorer outcomes in HIV-infected IDUs are related to a variety of factors, including increased rates of non-HIV-related deaths, hepatitis C, delayed access to effective treatment, lower adherence to care and treatment regimens, continuation of illicit drug use, depression and negative life events. The available evidence strongly suggests the need for the large-scale implementation of comprehensive treatment and care strategies for IDUs that include both treatment of drug dependence and HAART."

We here evaluated whether ENF administration leads to a change in humoral parameters, including IgE, possibly related to ENF-associated injection site reactions (ISRs). A 24-week prospective study was conducted in multidrug resistant patients enrolled in the ENF Early Access Program characterized by CD4 counts < or =100 cells/microlitre and no other active antiretroviral drug. Licensed commercial laboratory assays were used to measure the parameters considered in this study. Results are reported as medians (interquartiles IQR). Statistical analyses were performed using Wilcoxon sign rank, Wilcoxon rank sum and Kruskall Wallis tests. Total IgM, IgA and IgG did not change significantly throughout the study. Conversely, a significant increase in IgE was observed in all patients, in those with normal as well as in those with altered IgE at baseline (BL). ISRs such as induration and number of nodules were more frequent in patients with altered BL IgE. IgE increased significantly in all patients, regardless of the different stratifications in their BL CD4 counts. Of note, the ENF-induced increase in CD4 occurred significantly in all patients, independently of their BL IgE levels. The immunological response associated with ENF treatment is accompanied by a selective increase in IgE levels. Determination of IgE could be used in the monitoring ISRs associated with ENE"

The present study investigates the effects of both infectious diseases and other demographical and environmental factors on the risk of HCC among a representative group of Egyptian patients with HCC (n = 102) and controls with no signs of hepatopathology (n = 96). Factors associated with an increased risk of HCC in Egypt were age over 60 yrs-old, farming, cigarette smoking and occupational exposure to chemicals such as pesticides. However, schistosomiasis (relative risk, RR: 5.22; 95% confidence intervals, C.I.: 2.93-9.31) and HBV infection (RR: 12.51; 95% C.I.: 6.11-25.59) were the major risk factors in the development of HCC. Schistosomiasis increased the severity of HBV infection and elevated the risk of HCC over that associated with the HBV infection alone. Understanding these relationships may enable us to determine the susceptibility to HCC among high risk groups and to provide these individuals with effective measures for early prevention or intervention."

The activity of two nucleotide analogs, tenofovir and adefovir (PMPA and PMEA, respectively), against non-B subtypes and nucleoside-resistant primary HIV-1 isolates was assessed. Tenofovir and adefovir were fully active against a panel of subtypes A, C, D, E, F, G, and group O primary HIV-1 isolates as compared with their respective activity against subtype B isolates. Moreover, the susceptibility of a panel of 10 primary HIV-1 isolates with >10-fold mean resistance to zidovudine, lamivudine, and abacavir was within 2.2-fold of wild-type tenofovir susceptibility for each isolate. An oral prodrug of tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF), is currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.

Therefore, changes in incidence, risk factors, and circulating genotypes over time were determined among drug users in Amsterdam over an 18-year period (1985-2002). Sera of 1,268 drug users, both injecting and non-injecting, were screened for anti-HBc. HBV genotypes of the anti-HBc seroconverters were determined. Poisson regression was used to test for temporal trends in incidence and to identify risk factors for seroconversion. Of the 598 participants who were anti-HBc negative at entry, 83 seroconverted for anti-HBc. The incidence of HBV declined from 5.9/100 Person Years up to 1993 to 0/100 Person Years in 2002. Of the drug users infected acutely, both injecting and non-injecting, 88% were infected with the same genotype D, serotype ayw3 strain. Multivariate analyses revealed current injecting, age, and calendar year of visit as independent risk factors. The decline in the incidence of HBV among drug users in Amsterdam is probably caused by a decline in injecting behavior. Injecting and non-injecting drug users were infected with the same strain, indicating that drug users infect one another, regardless of their risk behavior. After 2000, no injecting drug users with an acute HBV infection were reported to the Public Health Service Amsterdam and the specific genotype D strain had disappeared. These findings suggest that drug users may no longer be a high-risk group for HBV infection in Amsterdam. However, trends in drug use need to be monitored."

All these patients were infected before the mid 1980s because of non-virally inactivated pooled blood products. Fourteen patients (13.7%) were HCV-RNA negative with no signs of liver disease and were considered to have cleared the virus. Eighty-eight patients (86.3%) were HCV-RNA positive. The HCV genotype distribution was 1a in 20.5%, 1b in 36.4%, 2 in 17.0%, 3 in 15.9%, 4 in 3.4%, and mixed in 6.8% of cases. Twenty-four patients (23.5%) had serum cryoglobulins, symptomatic in 4 cases, and associated with liver disease and with genotype 1.

There were 3 (3.4%) liver-related deaths. HCV genotype 1, patient's age at evaluation, duration of infection, and severity of congenital bleeding disorder were associated with more advanced liver disease.

Previous studies have suggested that the interleukin 28B (IL28B) rs8099917 genotype is related to spontaneous clearance of HCV in Caucasian populations. Our objective was to investigate the association of the IL28B rs8099917 genotype with spontaneous clearance of HCV by community-dwelling Japanese. A cross-sectional community-based population study of 993 Japanese residents was conducted. Based on anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA levels, 50 subjects were assigned to the spontaneous-clearance group, 155 to the chronic-infection group, and 788 to the control group. Logistic regression analysis was done to examine the roles of the IL28B rs8099917 genotype and sex. To analyze the interactions between these factors, an ""IL28B rs809991 genotype × sex"" interaction term was included in the multivariate analysis. Significantly more subjects in the spontaneous-clearance group than in the chronic-infection group had the favorable IL28B rs8099917 genotype and were female. Multivariate logistic regression analysis extracted the favorable IL28B rs8099917 TT genotype (odds ratio [OR] 9.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.16-40.83, P = 0.003) and female sex (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.16-4.45, P = 0.017) as factors contributing to the spontaneous clearance of HCV. No significant interaction was found between the IL28B rs8099917 genotype and sex (P for interaction = 0.428).

A total of 272 patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b were grouped according to genetic polymorphisms near the IL28B gene (rs8099917). The ability of reduced HCV RNA levels at 4 and 12 weeks after starting therapy to predict a sustained virologic response was evaluated based on these genotypes. Among patients with the TT genotype for rs8099917 (associated with a favorable response), the rates of sustained virologic response were higher in patients with a ≥3 log(10) reduction in serum HCV RNA levels at 4 weeks after starting therapy (P < 0.0001). In contrast, among patients with the TG/GG genotype (associated with an unfavorable response), there were no differences in this rate based on the reduction in HCV RNA levels at 4 weeks. Early viral dynamics at 4 weeks after starting therapy retains its predictive value for sustained virologic response in patients with the TT genotype for rs8099917, but not in patients with the TG/GG genotype. Patients who are likely to achieve sustained virologic response despite unfavorable TG/GG genotype cannot be identified based on early viral dynamics during therapy. In contrast, lack of early virologic response at 12 weeks retains a strong predictive value for the failure of sustained virologic response regardless of IL28B polymorphisms, which remains useful as a factor to stop therapy."

The aim is the establishment of practical guidelines in the evaluation and antiviral treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This includes recommendations for the initial evaluation of patients, the choice and duration of antiviral therapy and the follow-up after antiviral therapy. Hepatitis C is a slowly progressive disease. The initial evaluation of chronically HCV-infected patients should include liver biochemistry testing, virological testing and abdominal ultrasound imaging. Liver biopsy is no longer a routine procedure. Antiviral treatment should be considered for all HCV-infected patients. Current antiviral treatment is a long-term process and is associated with substantial side effects. When deciding whether to start treatment or not, the chance of successful treatment (80% with hepatitis C genotype 2 and 3 and 50% with hepatitis C genotype 1 and 4), the fibrosis stage, the expected side effects and the compliance of the patient should be taken into consideration. In the absence of significant fibrosis and necroinflammation in liver biopsy, postponing treatment is an option. Current antiviral treatment is contraindicated in patients with Child-Pugh-class B or C cirrhosis. The possibility of a liver transplantation should be investigated in these patients. Significant comorbidity with a limited life expectancy is an absolute contraindication for antiviral treatment Treatment of chronic hepatitis C consists of administration of peginterferon and ribavirin for 24 or 48 weeks. Patients with hepatitis C genotype 1 or 4 are treated for 48 weeks. Patients with hepatitis C genotype 2 or 3 are treated for 24 weeks. In patients with undetectable HCV RNA after four weeks (28 days) of treatment, a shorter treatment is equally effective (12 to 16 weeks for hepatitis C genotype 2 or 3; 24 weeks for hepatitis C genotype 1 or 4). Outpatient clinic visits are recommended at the start and after 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment, and thereafter every four to six weeks until the end of treatment. It is recommended to stop treatment if the HCV RNA level has not decreased by at least 2 log10 IU/ml (c/ml) after 12 weeks of treatment or when HCV RNA is still detectable after 24 weeks of treatment. The recommended frequency of outpatient clinic visits for patients who are not being treated is once every six months in patients with cirrhosis, otherwise every 12 months. It is expected that new anti-HCV-medication (STAT-C, specifically targeted antiviral therapy for HCV) will become available in the near future. Therefore treatment of chronic HCV infection will probably be more effective in the future."

Recently, genome-wide association studies have shown a strong correlation between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the interleukin-28B (IL28B) gene and spontaneous or treatment-induced HCV clearance. We have investigated whether protective IL28B genetic variants are associated with HCV-specific T-cell responses among Spanish blood donors. The rs12979860 IL28B haplotype was determined in 69 anti-HCV-positive blood donors (21 HCV RNA negative and 48 HCV RNA positive) and 30 seronegative donors. In all cases, HCV-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses to HCV recombinant proteins (core, NS3 and NS3 helicase) were assessed by ex vivo interferon-γ ELISpot assay. The rs12979860-CC genotype was highly overrepresented in donors with spontaneous HCV clearance when compared to those with chronic infection (76.2%vs 29.2%, P < 0.001; odds ratio, 7.77; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-25.3, P < 0.001). HCV-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses were detected in 16 (76.2%) spontaneous resolvers especially towards nonstructural proteins, but with no correlation with IL28B genotype. Chronic individuals had a significantly lower overall T-cell response again irrespective of IL28B genotype. When spontaneous resolvers and chronic individuals were stratified according to their IL28B genotype, significantly stronger T-cell responses were only observed among those with non-CC haplotypes. Although the protective rs12979860 IL28B CC genotype is associated with spontaneous HCV clearance, stronger CD4(+) T-cell responses towards NS3 were only evident among those with non-CC haplotypes."

Overall, there were 53 (64.6%) with HIV coinfection, 20 (25.0%) with self-reported cirrhosis, and 22 (26.8%) with a history of prior HCV treatment. Of all, 93.2% wanted HCV treatment, but 45.9% were unwilling/unable to spend anything out of pocket, 29.4% were waiting for new therapies, and 23.5% were recommended to defer HCV treatment. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were more likely to want treatment within one year (90.2% versus 68.2%, p = 0.02), more willing to join a clinical trial (74.5% versus 8.0%, p < 0.01), more willing to take medications twice daily (86.3% versus 61.5%, p = 0.01), and more likely to prefer hepatitis C treatment by an infectious diseases/HIV physician (36.7% versus 4.0%, p < 0.01). Of all, 77.1% of coinfected patients were willing to change antiretroviral therapy if necessary to treat HCV, but only 48.0% of patients were willing to take a medication if it had not been studied in HIV-positive patients. Treatment preferences differ between HIV/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected patients. Despite a strong willingness among the study cohort to start HCV treatment, other factors such as cost, access to medications, and provider reluctance may be delaying treatment initiation."
2823,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Antiretroviral (ARV) adherence has largely been considered from the perspective of an individual's behavior with less attention given to potential structural causes for lapses in treatment, such as the cost of medications and care. HIV medication expense is typically covered by third party payers. However, private insurance premiums and deductibles may rise, or policies terminated such as with a change in employment. Likewise, a patient's eligibility for publicly funded coverage like state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP) or Medicaid can also be lost. We conducted a one-time survey of a sample of 300 patients receiving HIV care at a single large academic center in the south of United States to examine lapses in HIV therapy due to financial reasons. We found that during the prior year, financial issues including medication cost or coverage led to a lapse in ARVs in 10% (n = 31) of participants. However, of the 42% (n = 125) participants who had been enrolled in ADAP at any time during the prior year, 21% (n = 26) reported an ARV lapse due to problems with ADAP or medication cost. Respondents cited ADAP's required semi-annual renewal process and other administrative issues as the cause of ARV lapses. The median duration of missed ARVs was 2 weeks (range of <1-23 weeks). Non-HIV medication and transportation to and from clinic costs were also identified as financial burdens to care by respondents. In conclusion, although conducted at a single medical center and one state, this study suggests that a significant minority of HIV-infected patients encounter financial barriers to ARV access, and this is paradoxically more common among those enrolled in the state ADAP. Streamlining, supporting, and simplifying ADAP renewal procedures will likely reduce lapses in ARV adherence and persistence."

Five (0.8 percent) were positive, and HIV was isolated from one of these. Follow-up investigations in 1985 revealed that three of the five seropositive persons had died of illnesses suggestive of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and two remained healthy but seropositive. In 1986, a serosurvey we conducted using a cluster-sampling technique in the same region showed a seroprevalence of 0.8 percent in 389 randomly selected residents. The seroprevalence in 283 prostitutes was 11 percent. Patients with AIDS were identified in various hospitals in the province. Risk factors for AIDS included a greater than average number of sexual partners and residence outside the area. We believe that the long-term stability of HIV infection in residents of rural Zaire suggests that social change may have promoted the spread of AIDS in Africa."
19822,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The structural polyprotein Gag of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is necessary and sufficient for formation of virus-like particles. Its C-terminal p6 domain harbors short peptide motifs that facilitate virus release from the plasma membrane and mediate incorporation of the viral Vpr protein. p6 has been shown to be the major viral phosphoprotein in HIV-1-infected cells and virions, but the sites and functional relevance of p6 phosphorylation are not clear. Here, we identified phosphorylation of several serine and threonine residues in p6 in purified virus preparations using mass spectrometry. Mutation of individual candidate phosphoacceptor residues had no detectable effect on virus assembly, release, and infectivity, however, suggesting that phosphorylation of single residues may not be functionally relevant. Therefore, a comprehensive mutational analysis was conducted changing all potentially phosphorylatable amino acids in p6, except for a threonine that is part of an essential peptide motif. To avoid confounding changes in the overlapping pol reading frame, mutagenesis was performed in a provirus with genetically uncoupled gag and pol reading frames. An HIV-1 derivative carrying 12 amino acid changes in its p6 region, abolishing all but one potential phosphoacceptor site, showed no impairment of Gag assembly and virus release and displayed only very subtle deficiencies in viral infectivity in T-cell lines and primary lymphocytes. All mutations were stable over 2 weeks of culture in primary cells. Based on these findings, we conclude that phosphorylation of p6 is dispensable for HIV-1 assembly, release, and infectivity in tissue culture."
16995,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Several guidelines are available to guide the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children. The recommendations in these guidelines show significant variability. Because there is no well-established evidence on when to start HAART, it is left to the discretion of the pediatrician which guidelines to follow. We conducted a survey concerning the indications for starting antiretroviral therapy among pediatricians involved in the treatment of HIV-infected patients in Europe and the United States. We compared the results of this survey with the guidelines available at the time, the recently adapted guidelines and literature evidence. Our results indicate that in clinical practice HAART was initiated at higher viral loads and lower CD4 counts than recommended by the guidelines. American guidelines recommended and still recommend more aggressive treatment than the European guidelines, and this is reflected in clinical practice. Until recently all guidelines were based on long term risk analyses of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and death performed in cohort data. A recent short term risk analysis makes it possible to calculate the 6 or 12-month risk for progression to AIDS or death for an individual child. Because viral load and CD4 count are typically measured every 3 months, one can argue that it is clinically more relevant to base the decision of when to start HAART on the short term probability of disease progression. Guidelines in Europe are now based on this type of analysis. The American guidelines only adopted the thresholds for CD4 and viral load. The short term risk analysis also shows that the risk for developing AIDS varies markedly with age. This should be reflected in all guidelines. Determining the acceptable risk of disease progression is difficult and influenced by patient-, doctor- and culture-related factors. The controversy over whether or not to treat asymptomatic infants is unresolved as well. All infants have a very high risk of disease progression regardless of their viral load or CD4 count, but lifelong treatment with a potential for significant toxicities and risk of developing resistance is also not an appealing option. We recommend an attempt to achieve a consensus among the different working groups to reduce the number of different guidelines, which should be based on the literature evidence. Because all risk analyses are based on information from the pre-HAART era, a head-to-head trial comparing early versus deferred HAART would be useful. This may be difficult to accomplish. The first step could be an analysis of retrospective data from collaborative cohort data."

One hundred eight patients underwent a total of 169 graft procedures; mean follow-up was 14 1/2 months. There were 18 (17%) patients who were HIV-positive who had no symptoms, 11 (10%) patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and 79 (73%) patients who were HIV-negative. Twenty-three percent (25/108) of patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA), most of whom also had either AIDS or asymptomatic HIV infection. Dialysis procedures included 44 autogenous reconstructions (26%), 117 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts (69%), and 8 (5%) procedures of unknown type. Arteriovenous fistula or graft thrombosis was a frequent complication. The overall 12-month graft patency rate was 41%, and patients with HIV infection or a history of IVDA did not have a significantly increased risk of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that the use of PTFE as opposed to autogenous reconstruction was the only significant risk factor found for occlusion within the first 12 months after operation (p < 0.01). Twenty-five graft infections occurred, all in PTFE grafts. The PTFE graft infection rate was 43% in patients with AIDS, 36% in patients who were HIV-positive and who had no symptoms, and 15% in patients who were HIV-negative (p < 0.05). Patients with a history of IVDA had a 41% PTFE graft infection rate versus a 13% infection rate in patients who did not have a history of IVDA (p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Firstly, there is a lack of accurate data on the numbers of people infected by the HIV virus and uncertainty as to the natural history of the infection. This limits the ability to plan health care strategies for the future. Secondly, it is difficult to encompass detailed knowledge of the variety of illnesses which occur in patients with HIV infection and AIDS and the even broader range of therapies and outcomes reported in the literature. Thirdly, the clinician has to keep pace with the rapidly changing nature of the models for HIV pathogenesis and possible therapeutic interventions. However, despite these gaping holes in our knowledge, the main message of this clinical review is that a general awareness of the wide spectrum of conditions associated with HIV infection, coupled with a well organised, multidisciplinary and pragmatic approach, will provide the patients with the best chance of being correctly diagnosed and treated. Furthermore, it must be remembered that, while seeking scientific knowledge and experimenting for a cure, AIDS remains a universally fatal condition. It is essential that palliative care is available alongside and within facilities which are providing potentially curative clinical drug trials. It is equally vital that the patients be given autonomy in deciding which of these aspects of care they choose at any time. Such an approach, and the experience of caring for patients with HIV infection who pass from apparent health to fatal disease, will continue to test the skills and reserves of physicians well into the next century."

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between HCV infection and PTB. The electronic database was searched until 1 September 2014. Relevant studies reporting the association between HCV infection and the risk of PTB were included for further evaluation. Statistical analysis was performed using revmen 5.3 and stata 10.0. Nine studies involving 4186698 participants and 5218 HCV infection cases were included. A significant association between HCV infection and PTB was observed (odds ratio = 1.62, 95% CI 1.48-1.76, P < 0.001, fixed-effects model). Stratification according to maternal smoking/alcohol abuse, maternal drug abuse or coinfected with HBV and/or HIV matched groups still demonstrated that women with HCV infection had a high risk for PTB. Findings from our meta-analysis suggested that maternal HCV infection was significantly associated with an increased risk of PTB. In the future, pathophysiological studies are warranted to ascertain the causality and explore the possible biological mechanisms involved. "

All around the globe correctional facilities are known as potential source of spreading such disease. During summer 2002, HIV, HCV antibodies, hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test were checked in venous blood samples of 252 injecting drug abuser prisoners from correctional facilities in southern Iran. Overall HIV, HCV and HBV infection rate was 15.1% (38/249), 64.8% (163/249), and 4.7% (12/249), respectively. HCV infection rate of HIV positive cases was 94% (35/38). All RPR results were negative. Duration of previous drug abuse and imprisonment were correlated with HIV and HCV infection (p value = 0.0003 and 0.015 & p value =0.02 and 0.02). Considering the higher prevalence of HIV and HCV infection in correctional facilities compared to general population of Iran, warrants immediate multidisciplinary approaches targeted at controlling further spread of these infections primarily among prisoners and secondarily preventing them to act as carrier to general population."
9485,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections or the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), zidovudine is a first-line therapy that reduces morbidity and may reduce mortality.  By delaying progression to AIDS, the drug reduces the duration and incidence of hospitalisations in a given time period, resulting in overall decreases in the cost of medical treatment per unit of survival time.  In current therapeutic dosages zidovudine is generally well tolerated.  Most pharmacoeconomic and quality-of-life studies of this agent were conducted using data relating to higher dosages and higher drug acquisition costs than those currently applicable, but nevertheless generally support the cost-effectiveness of zidovudine in patients with HIV disease.  Studies examining the use of the drug in higher dosages demonstrate neither clear positive nor negative effects of the drug on quality of life. The cost effectiveness of the drug as prophylaxis against seroconversion after occupational exposure to HIV is dependent primarily on the establishment of clinical effectiveness in this condition.  Further pharmacoeconomic studies should examine changes to dosage and cost factors, along with direct nonmedical treatment costs, indirect medical treatment costs and the effects of the drug on quality of life.  An evaluation of existing studies suggests that if these factors were accounted for, zidovudine might be shown to be more clearly cost effective, and indeed its use in the treatment of patients with HIV disease might be found to result in cost savings."

The median observation period was 20.5 months. At 25 months the probability of survival was 82%, the probability of progression of disease from CDC III or IV C2 to IV C1 (AIDS) was 20% in patients on continuous AZT treatment and 50% in patients with interruption of treatment. Three patients developed severe leukopenia and 3 patients severe anemia during AZT treatment. In 1 patient a dose-dependent striking increase of transaminases during AZT treatment was observed. In 7 patients treatment was interrupted, in 1 patient because of anemia, in 1 because of pruritus and in 5 patients because of non-compliance. No significant changes in the consumption of clotting factor concentrates and number of bleeding episodes before and during AZT treatment were noted. We conclude, that both hematological and non-hematological side effects of AZT in HIV 1-infected hemophilic patients are comparable to those seen in other risk groups. AZT does not increase the bleeding tendency in this patient group."

A retrospective analysis of HBV infections was performed in 70 MM patients who received a sequential bortezomib-containing induction therapy and ASCT in our department from June 2006 to February 2012. Among the 70 patients in our study, 11 cases (15.7 %) were hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg+), and 23 cases (33.3 %) were hepatitis B core antibody positive (HBcAb+). Eight cases were HBsAg, hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), and HBcAb positive, while one case was HBsAg, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and HBcAb positive. The median follow-up times for the HBsAg+ group and the HBsAg-negative (HBsAg-) group were 27.0 (7.6-85.2) months and 28.7 (7.1-111.0) months, respectively. The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year overall survival rates of the HBsAg+ group were 90.9, 80.8, and 34.6 %, respectively, and the median survival time was 31.2 months (95 % CI, 24.8-37.6). The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year overall survival rates of the HBsAg- group were 98.2, 94, and 84.6 %, respectively, while the median survival time was not yet available. There was a statistically significant difference (p=0.008) in the overall survival rate between the two groups. By Cox regression analysis, we found that the HBsAg+ status was a prognostic factor, which could independently influence the overall survival rate for ASCT. In conclusion, the HBsAg+ status is an independent risk factor for patients with MM receiving ASCT. The application of standard antiviral treatment might help to overcome this risk factor."
6431,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"A novel hepatotropic virus, named NV-F virus, was recently identified. The clinical information for this virus is still scarce. Using PCR assay, NV-F viral DNA (NV-F-DNA) was detected in 12 of 50 (24%) hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients (HCV-coinfected [HCVCI] group), 34 of 250 (13.6%) hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients (HBV-coinfected [HBVCI] group), and 28 of 100 (28%) non-A-to-E (NAE) hepatitis patients. Basic clinical parameters were not significantly different among the three groups. By use of a PCR-based quantitative assay, the NV-F-DNA concentration was found to be above the detection limit (1.2 x 10(5) copies/ml) in 12/12 (100%) HCVCI patients, 14/34 (41.2%) HBVCI patients, and 4/28 (14.3%) NAE patients. The median serum NV-F-DNA concentration was 9.3 x 10(5) copies/ml in HCVCI patients, but it was below the detection limit in HBVCI and NAE patients (P values were 0.0045 and 0.0001, respectively). Stepwise multiple regression analysis identified the presence of anti-HCV as an independent factor for NV-F-DNA concentrations (beta = 6.2 x 10(9); P = 0.0245). In HBVCI patients, the NV-F-DNA concentration was inversely correlated with the HBV DNA concentration. The median NV-F-DNA concentration was below the detection limit in patients with HBV DNA concentrations above 1.4 x 10(5) copies/ml, but it was 1.58 x 10(6) copies/ml in patients with HBV DNA concentrations below 1.4 x 10(5) copies/ml (P = 0.030). In conclusion, NV-F-DNA concentrations were higher in HCVCI patients. A reciprocal relationship was found between NV-F-DNA and HBV DNA concentrations in HBVCI patients, indicating the presence of viral interference between these two DNA viruses."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of occult HBV infection on the early-onset of HCC in HCV-infected patients. A total of 173 HCC patients with HCV infection were enrolled and classified into 2 groups according to the median age of HCC onset: the early-onset group (n=91; 61.1±5.6 years) and the late-onset group (n=82; 73.8±3.7 years). Independent factors associated with the early-onset of HCC were assessed by multivariate analysis. In the overall analysis, independent risk factors for the early-onset of HCC were the white blood cell count and alanine aminotransferase level, but not the presence of HBV DNA. In a stratification analysis according to albumin levels of ≥3.5 g/dl, the presence of HBV DNA was a significant independent risk factor for the early-onset of HCC (OR 145.18, 95% CI 1.38-15296.61, P=0.036), whereas the presence of antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen was not found to be a risk factor. The presence of HBV DNA was not a risk factor for the early-onset of HCC in the overall analysis. However, its presence was an independent factor for the early-onset of HCC in HCV-infected patients with an albumin level of ≥3.5 g/dl. Thus, occult HBV infection may accelerate hepatocarcino-genesis in HCV-infected patients with relatively low carcinogenic potential."

In a subgroup of patients, liver mitochondrial activities were measured by spectrophotometry and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Thirty patients were included with median values of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels: 80 U/L, age: 46 years, body mass index: 23 kg/m(2), HIV RNA: 200 copies/mL, CD4 count: 365/mm(3), duration of HIV infection: 13 years, and duration of treatment exposure: 118, 41, and 53 months for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors, respectively. Histological anomalies were found in 22 of 30 patients. Steatosis was present in 18 patients, severe in nine patients, and associated with inflammation in 16 patients with a diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Fibrosis was found in 18 patients, severe in six patients and associated with steatosis in 13 patients. Significant liver respiratory complex I defect, contrasting with high complex IV activity and normal mitochondrial DNA content, was observed in the group of patients compared with controls.

This study aimed to compare the morbidity, mortality, immunological and virological outcomes of antiretroviral therapy (ART) between HIV-infected patients with and without HCV co-infection in a setting where HCV infection is rarely treated. A retrospective cohort study was conducted among HIV-infected patients attending Ramathibodi Hospital between 1998 and 2008. We studied 171 HIV-infected patients 57 with and 114 without HCV co-infection. The mean age of patients was 34.6 years and 67.3% were males. There were no differences in demographics, HIV staging, CD4 counts, ART use and ART regimens between the two groups (p>0.05). All patients who had a CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 or had an AIDS-defining illness during following-up were given ART; these consisted of 84.2% and 88.6% of patients with and without HCV co-infection, respectively. Only 4 out of 57 (7%) HCV co-infected patients were treated for HCV infection. During a median (range) follow-up time of 2.9 (1.2-9.8) years, no patients died in either group. The rates of AIDS-defining illnesses and hospitalization in the two groups were similar (p>0.05). In a resource-limited setting where HCV treatment is not affordable, HCV co-infection does not appear to affect morbidity, mortality or treatment responses to ART. ART may have a greater impact than HCV co-infection on the survival of HCV/HIV co-infected patients. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term impact of HCV co-infection on clinical outcomes in HIV-infected patients without HCV treatment."

Admissions of HIV-positive patients have been decreasing, in contrast, since 2008, reflecting the dramatic improvements in quality of life and survival provided by triple antiretroviral regimens. HIV infection is now a chronic disease that exposes patients to the virus and antiretroviral drugs for many years. One consequence has been the emergence of new health conditions in HIV-positive patients, such as tumors, cardiovascular disease, and osteoarticular complications. These epidemiological and clinical changes have made it necessary for rheumatologists to learn about the osteoarticular abnormalities associated with the HIV, which they are likely to encounter at some point during their everyday practice. Osteoporosis is one such abnormality, and this review article starts with a discussion of the literature on this topic. Bone loss is common, chiefly in males. Multiple factors are involved. Studies have demonstrated an increase in the fracture risk and, consequently, recommendations about the screening and treatment of osteoporosis have been issued. The focus of this review article then turns to the other rheumatic manifestations seen in HIV-positive patients, including osteomalacia, avascular necrosis, and inflammatory joint disease. Osteoarticular pain is frequently reported by HIV-positive patients. Identifying the cause is essential to determine the best treatment strategy. Interestingly, immunosuppressant drugs, and even biotherapies, have shown a good safety profile in these immunodeficient patients."

However, the evolution of bone mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolism during HAART has not been studied yet. In the current longitudinal study we monitored the changes of BMD and bone metabolism over a period of 12 months. Thirty-two HIV-infected children (15 girls and 17 boys), aged from 6.3 to 17.7 yr, with a long duration of HAART exposure (40.0 months at baseline) were enrolled in the study. As a control group, 381 healthy volunteers of comparable age were assessed. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine and whole skeleton by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP, as bone formation index) and N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (as bone resorption index) were measured in serum and urine, respectively. BMD values at baseline were significantly lower at all skeletal sites than those of control subjects. The annual increment of spine BMD was comparable to normal, whereas that of the whole skeleton was significantly lower (P < 0.04). BALP and N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen concentrations were significantly higher compared with controls at baseline and at follow-up. BALP annual changes of HIV patients were significantly different from normal. Our data confirm the presence of low BMD and bone metabolism derangement in HIV-infected children treated with HAART. The role of possible therapeutic approach to restore bone mass and metabolism should be assessed in pediatrics."

Fischer's discriminant analysis was applied to define functions capable of differentiating between the study groups (HCV, HCV/HTLV-1 and HCV/HTLV-2). The discriminant accuracy was evaluated by cross-validation. Alcohol consumption, use of intravenous drugs or inhaled cocaine and sexual partnership with intravenous drug users were more frequent in the HCV/HTLV-2 group, whereas patients in the HCV group more often reported abdominal pain or a sexual partner with hepatitis. Coinfected patients presented higher platelet counts, but aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels were higher among HCV-infected subjects. No significant difference between the groups was seen regarding liver histopathological findings. Through discriminant analysis, classification functions were defined, including sex, age group, intravenous drug use and sexual partner with hepatitis. Cross-validation revealed high discriminant accuracy for the HCV group."

Three cohorts of coinfected patients were analyzed retrospectively over a period of 7 to 10 months: group A was antiretroviral drug naïve at baseline and then on HAART for the remainder of the study, group B did not receive antiretroviral therapy at any point, and group C was on HAART for the entire study. HCV quasispecies diversity was analyzed by sequencing hypervariable region 1. In a longitudinal analysis, there was no significant change from baseline in any immunologic, virologic, or quasispecies parameter in any of the three groups. However, in comparison to groups A and B, group C had significantly higher CD4+- and CD8+-cell counts, a trend toward a higher HCV load, and significantly increased number of HCV clones, entropy, genetic distance, and ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ka/Ks). In addition, CD4+-cell count was positively correlated with HCV load, genetic distance, and Ka. Interestingly, patients infected with HCV genotype 2 or 3 had a significantly higher CD4+-cell count, HCV load, genetic distance, and Ka/Ks than those infected with genotype 1. These results suggest that there is no immediate effect of HAART on HCV but that, with prolonged HAART, immune restoration results in an increase in HCV load and quasispecies diversity."

This prospective observational study was designed to examine the impact of initiation and timing of ART on neurocognitive functioning in YLWH in the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. Treatment naïve YLWH age 18-24 completed baseline and four additional assessments of attention/working memory, complex executive, and motor functioning over 3 years. Group 1 co-enrolled in an early ART initiation study and initiated ART at enrollment CD4 >350 (n = 56); group 2 had CD4 >350 and were not initiating ART (n = 66); group 3 initiated ART with CD4 <350 (n = 59) per standard of care treatment guidelines at the time. Treatment was de-intensified to boosted protease inhibitor monotherapy at 48 weeks for those in group 1 with suppressed viral load. Covariates included demographic, behavioral, and medical history variables. Analyses used hierarchical linear modeling. All groups showed improved performance with peak at 96 weeks in all three functional domains. Trajectories of change were not significantly associated with treatment, timing of treatment initiation, or ART de-intensification. Demographic variables and comorbidities were associated with baseline functioning but did not directly interact with change over time. In conclusion, YLWH showed improvement in neurocognitive functioning over time that may be related to practice effects and nonspecific impact of study participation. Neither improvement nor decline in functioning was associated with timing of ART initiation or therapy de-intensification."

Participants were youth with behaviorally acquired HIV (n = 20; 65% female; median age, 21 years) with adherence problems, who received once-daily DOT. Youth were assessed at baseline, week 12 (post-DOT), and week 24 (follow-up). At baseline, 55% of youth reported having clinical depressive symptoms compared to 27% at week 12 with sustained improvements at week 24. At baseline, substance use was reported within the borderline clinical range (T(score) = 68), with clinical but statistically nonsignificant improvement (T(score) = 61) at week 12. Hopelessness scores reflected optimism for the future. Coping strategies showed significantly decreased cognitive avoidance (p = .02), emotional discharge (p = .004), and acceptance/resignation (""nothing I can do,"" p = .004), whereas positive reappraisal and seeking support emerged. With the exception of depressive symptoms, week 12 improvements were not sustained at week 24. DOT adherence was predicted by higher baseline depression (p = .05), beliefs about medicine (p = .006) and perceived threat of illness scores (p = .03). Youth with behaviorally acquired HIV and adherence problems who participated in a community-based DOT intervention reported clinically improved depressive symptoms, and temporarily reduced substance use and negative coping strategies. Depressive symptoms, beliefs about medicine, and viewing HIV as a potential threat predicted better DOT adherence."

A multisite, randomized, double-blind clinical trial of DAPTA versus placebo prior to combination antiretroviral therapy conducted with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 seropositive participants having cognitive impairment showed no overall cognitive effect, though subgroups with greater impairment and CD4 cell counts of 201 to 500 cells/mm3 at baseline showed significant improvement. The objective of this study was to examine whether intranasal administration of DAPTA at a dose of 2 mg three times per day (tid) was associated with a reduction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral (plasma and serum) viral load among a subgroup of participants completing 6 months of treatment. Baseline and 6-month CSF (n = 92) and peripheral (plasma n = 33; serum n = 24) viral load were measured by the Roche Ultrasensitive assay, version 1.5, with reflexive use of the AMPLICOR assay and preservation of the blind. A DAPTA treatment indicator variable was tested using generalized linear models on change in viral load. Peripheral load (combined plasma and serum) was significantly reduced in the DAPTA-treated group. No group differences in CSF viral load were found. This retrospective study on a limited subgroup of the original trial sample indicated that DAPTA treatment may reduce peripheral viral load without concomitant CSF effects. Future studies should be undertaken to confirm the existence of this result and the CSF-periphery dissociation observed with respect to HIV-1-associated cognitive-motor impairment."

The prevalence and risk factors were assessed and the risk screening form was developed. The results revealed that the prevalence of anti-HCV was 2.90%. Male blood donors had relatively higher anti-HCV positive rate than females (3.21% vs 1.77%). The significant risk factors from univariate analysis were: (a) gender as male, OR = 1.94 (p = 0.042), (b) education to the primary level, OR = 4.15 (p < 0.001), (c) occupation as laborer or agriculture workers, OR = 2.87 (p < 0.001), police and military, OR = 1.82 (p = 0.046), (d) residence in a rural area, OR = 3.09 (p < 0.001), (e) a history of receiving blood or blood products, OR = 5.21 (p < 0.001), (f) a history of tattooing, OR = 1.70 (p = 0.043), (g) a history of IDU (Infecting Drug Use), OR = 41.43 (p < 0.001), (h) a history of STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) in the last year, OR = 3.87 (p = 0.021), and (i) a history of sexual service, OR = 4.24 (p = 0.017).

The sensitivity of this form was approximately 55.3% and the specificity was 85.7% when a cut-off score at risk > or =7 was used. If the cut-off score was > or =6, the screening form showed 77.1% of specificity and 61.3% sensitivity. This risk screening form should be applied not only for blood donation but also for pre-marital health screening."

Approximately 60 000 infections yearly are attributed to vertical transmission including the process of labour and breast-feeding. The vast of the population affected is in the developing world. Clinical officers and nurses play an important role in provision of primary health care to antenatal and postnatal mothers. There are a few studies that have explored the clinicians' knowledge on breast-feeding in the face of HIV and in relation to vertical transmission this being a vital component in prevention of maternal-to-child transmission. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinicians' knowledge on HIV in relation to breast-feeding in Kenya. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess knowledge of 161 clinical officers and nurses serving in the maternity and children' wards in various hospitals in Kenya. The participants were derived from all district and provincial referral facilities in Kenya. A preformatted questionnaire containing a series of questions on HIV and breast-feeding was administered to clinicians who were then scored and analyzed. All the 161 participants responded. Majority of clinicians (92%) were knowledgeable regarding prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Regarding HIV and breast-feeding, 49.7% thought expressed breast milk from HIV-positive mothers should be heated before being given. Majority (78.3%) thought breast milk should be given regardless of availability of alternatives. According to 74.5% of the participants, exclusive breast-feeding increased chances of HIV transmission. Two-thirds (66.5%) would recommend breast-feeding for mothers who do not know their HIV status (66.5%). This study observes that a majority of the clinicians have inadequate knowledge on breast-feeding in the face of HIV. There is need to promote training programmes on breast-feeding and transmission of HIV from mother to child. This can be done as in-service training, continuous medical education and as part of the formal training within medical institutions. "

We studied a large cohort of patients with chronic hepatitis C to determine the role of the route of transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the onset of cirrhosis. Six thousand six hundred sixty-four patients were enrolled in a nationwide survey of chronic hepatitis C in France. We first randomly defined a representative sample of 30 hospitals with medical units managing patients with HCV infection. All patients with chronic hepatitis C were enrolled if hepatitis C was diagnosed or treated in these units in 1991, 1992, or 1993. A questionnaire was filled in from the patients' charts and covered demographic data, risk factors for HCV infection, clinical and histological data, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus status, and alcohol intake. Descriptive statistics were prepared, and factors potentially related to the onset of cirrhosis were identified by means of univariate analysis followed by stepwise logistic regression analysis. Among the patients enrolled, 21.4% had biopsy-proven cirrhosis. Prevalence of cirrhosis markedly varied according to the route of transmission of HCV. It was significantly more frequent in blood recipients (23.4%) than in drug users (7.0%). Although the occurrence of cirrhosis was dependent on disease duration, it remained more frequent in blood recipients than in drug users for a given duration. Apart from the route of transmission, excessive alcohol intake was also associated with a higher risk of cirrhosis (34.9% vs. 18.2%; P < .001), and so was HBV infection (24.6% vs. 21.1%; P < .05). These factors acted independently of the route of transmission. Hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in 3.6% of all patients and in 17.8% of cirrhotic patients, and its occurrence was strongly and mainly related to the presence of cirrhosis. In conclusion, cirrhosis occurred in about 20% of the HCV-infected patients in this study and was more frequent in blood recipients than in drug users, independently of disease duration. Expected changes in the epidemiology of HCV infection might modify the risk of developing cirrhosis and, thereafter, cancer."

The antiretroviral activity of PMEA was compared with that of azidothymidine (AZT) in mice receiving the drug either immediately after infection or at late times in disease progression. Both AZT (oral, 30 mg/kg) and PMEA (parenteral, 25 and 5 mg/kg) were effective in slowing the development of disease when administered daily beginning on the day of infection. In contrast, neither drug alone was effective in modifying disease outcome when administered several weeks after viral infection. Human recombinant alpha interferon (rhuIFN alpha-B/D at 5 x 10(7) U/kg) was also ineffective when administered late in the course of disease. However, when administered in combination, both alpha interferon and PMEA (25 mg/kg) were able to suppress disease progression even when treatment was initiated as late as 3 weeks postinfection. Mice that were immunocompromised due to LP-BM5 virus infection were highly susceptible to acute (lethal) infection with herpes simplex virus type 1, whereas their immunocompetent littermates were not. PMEA was as effective as acyclovir in the treatment of opportunistic herpes simplex virus type 1 infections in LP-BM5 virus-infected mice. Thus, like AZT, PMEA was effective against retrovirus infection, and, like acyclovir, PMEA was effective against herpes simplex virus type 1 infection. This gives PMEA the unique potential of being useful in the treatment of opportunistic herpes simplex virus infections as well as the underlying retroviral disease."

A prospective, observational study of all patients with an initial CD4 < 50 x 10(6)/L was carried out. Epidemiological, clinical and HAART-associated data were analysed. Survival rates were estimated and pairs of survival curves were compared. The statistical program used was SPSS (version 10). In all, 349 HIV-infected patients were diagnosed, 117 (33.5%) had late-stage disease, mean CD4 23.9 x 10(6)/L and mean viral load (VL) 5.38 log10. In 98 men, mean age 39.5 years, percentage of AIDS cases at their first attendance was 83.8%. The median follow-up period was 28 months and 27 died. Pneumocystis carinii was the most frequent cause of AIDS (24.4%) and death (18.5%). Survival rates at 12, 24 and 36 months were 95.6%, 85.8% and 72.4%. HAART was started in 82.1%. VLs < 50 copies/mL at one, two and three years of treatment were 55.2%, 55.7% and 58.0%. Resource utilization included 0.58 hospitalization/patient/year and 0.07 events/patient/year. HAART-related complications were as follows: 50% lipodystrophy, 9.7% hypertension, 22.2% hyperglycaemia, 26.4% hypercholesterolaemia, 31.9% hypertrygliceridaemia and 18.1% mixed hyperlipaemia. Over one-third of our patients have advanced HIV infection at diagnosis. However, the outcome is favourable, with a good immunovirological response and few new opportunistic events. HAART-related complications were frequent."
18538,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Patients at the same stage of chronic disease may have had different rates of disease progression. The authors developed a mathematical modeling approach that allows reconstructing and comparing populations in terms of the disease progression rates of their participants when the disease onset and progression rates are unknown for individual patients. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection was used as an example. Both published and hypothetical models were used to describe the human immunodeficiency virus 1 epidemic (epidemic heterogeneity) and incubation and survival functions for different disease stages (individual heterogeneity). Reconstructions of populations with late disease (e.g., acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients) show a marked predominance of rapid progressors, unless the incidence of new infections has been decreasing for a long time. Rapid progressors would also predominate in populations of acute seroconverters, unless diagnosis is based on repeated serologic screening rather than symptoms. Populations of patients who have not progressed beyond an early stage of the disease (e.g., patients with CD4 cell counts > 500/microliter) tend to overrepresent slow progressors, especially if the epidemic has been decreasing for a long time. With this approach, one can assess whether the target population of a clinical trial is comparable with other patient populations at different places and times. Epidemic and individual diversity may even affect trial results if patients with different progression rates experience different benefits from a treatment. By modeling the targeted populations in trials of early versus deferred antiretroviral treatment, the authors observed larger treatment benefits in trials in which rapid progressors probably predominated, compared with trials of slow progressors."

In five patients the serum level of the core protein p24 decreased, while in five cases it remained unchanged. The level of viral RNA in plasma as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) decreased in four cases, was stable in another four, and increased in three cases. An anti-mouse (HAMA) response developed in eight patients and anti-idiotypic antibodies appeared in six. Immune complexes that formed in patient sera during the treatment were shown to contain mostly envelope glycoprotein gp120 which decreased in nine of the eleven treated patients toward the end of treatment. Antibodies inhibiting gp120 binding to CD4 became detectable or increased in six patients during immunotherapy. Serology of the HIV-1 V3 region was studied for both the HIV-1 IIIB and MN strains with no or very small changes in titer or avidity after treatment. No change in neutralizing titers to strain HTLVIIIB was observed in serum samples collected before and after treatment was terminated. In nine of the eleven patients stimulation of the T lymphocytes to proliferate in vitro when activated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was shown to be increased compared to before treatment. Increased T-cell proliferation was also noted with several antigens such as HIV-1 recombinant antigens, cytomegalovirus (CMV), tetanus toxoid (TT), and purified protein derivate of mycobacterium tuberculosis (PPD). These findings indicate a decreased total gp120 content in serum, permitting better T-cell activation."

This was an observational study of patients treated with the once-daily regimen atazanavir associated with 100 mg of ritonavir. Blood samples were drawn at steady state at various times ranging from 1 to 26 hours postdose. Atazanavir plasma concentrations were determined by a validated reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method. PK analysis of the atazanavir population was performed using a nonlinear mixed-effects model (NONMEM version 6). One hundred eighty-seven patients were included in the study. The atazanavir doses prescribed were 300 mg (n = 169), 400 mg (n = 12), 200 mg (n = 1), and 150 mg (n = 5). The atazanavir population PK was described using a 1-compartment model with first-order absorption. Mean PK parameter estimations (95% confidence interval, coefficients of variation %) were as follows: oral clearance (CL) = 7.6 L/h (6.9-8.3; 34%), volume of distribution (V) = 80.8 L (67.4-94; 37%), and absorption constant rate (Ka) = 1.05 hours (0.01-2.09; 156%). The mean estimated half-life (T-half) was 7.5 hours (95% confidence interval: 7.2 -7.8 hours). The estimated T-half of atazanavir was in agreement with that previously reported of 8.6 and 8.8 hours. We observed a wide interpatient variability for the PK parameters, especially for Ka. This population approach allowed us to determine atazanavir PK parameters in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients in a real-life context and to perform Bayesian analysis to predict Ctrough from samples collected at any moment during the dosing interval. This could therefore improve therapeutic drug monitoring interpretations and provide an interesting tool for correlation with virologic data."

To date, studies have not systematically examined the effect of multiple, co-occurring psychosocial problems (i.e., ""syndemics"") on ART adherence. Participants included 333 HIV-infected individuals who completed a comprehensive baseline evaluation, as part of a clinical trial to evaluate an intervention to treat depression and optimize medication adherence. Participants completed self-report questionnaires, and trained clinicians completed semi-structured diagnostic interviews. ART non-adherence was objectively measured via an electronic pill cap (i.e., MEMS). As individuals reported a greater number of syndemic indicators, their odds of non-adherence increased. Co-occurring psychosocial problems have an additive effect on the risk for poor ART adherence. Future behavioral medicine interventions are needed that address these problems comprehensively, and/or the core mechanisms that they share. "

In patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), wasting, particularly loss of metabolically active lean tissue, has been associated with increased mortality, accelerated disease progression, loss of muscle protein mass, and impairment of strength and functional status. Factors that may contribute to wasting include inadequate intake, malabsorptive disorders, metabolic alterations, hypogonadism, and excessive cytokine production. Evidence now demonstrates that nutritional counseling and support, appetite stimulants, progressive resistance training, and anabolic hormones can reverse weight loss and increase lean body mass in HIV-infected patients. Despite a growing body of evidence on the importance of nutritional intervention to prevent wasting in adults, maintain growth velocity in children, and promote restoration of weight and lean body mass in stable, low-weight patients, no therapeutic guidelines currently exist for the management of weight loss and wasting in HIV-infected patients. Principles and guidelines for assessment and management of weight loss and wasting in patients with HIV/AIDS are presented."

A total of 100 patients (Burkinavi cohort) undergoing antiretroviral therapy with a minimum of 42-months of follow-up (October 2005 to Mars 2009) were included. There were 77 females and 33 males with a mean age of 37 years. Most patients, i.e., 95%, were positive for HIV1. Mean body mass index was 22 kg/m2. Mean CD4 count was 280/mm3. Viral load was undetectable in 66 of the 71 patients who underwent viral load testing. Retroviral therapy consisted of the TriomuneR combination (Stavudine + lamivudine + névirapine) at a fixed dose in 27 cases. Cardiovascular risk factors included family history of high arterial blood pressure in 5 patients, smoking in 4, and obesity in 8. During follow-up, seven patients presented hypertension. Metabolic disorders included hyperglycemia (4%), hypertriglyceridemia (17%) and hypercholesterolemia (14%). Lipodystrophia was noted for 6 patients.

This study examined ART treatment adherence and adherence self-efficacy among people living with HIV with a history of drug use in Vietnam. We used cross-sectional baseline data collected between October 2014 and February 2015 from a randomized controlled trial in Vietnam. Of the 900 persons with a history of drug use in the trial, a sample of 109 people living with HIV currently on ART were included in the study. The vast majority (92%) of the participants reported not missing any medications in the past 30 days. Multiple regression results indicated that social support was positively associated with adherence self-efficacy (β = 0.420, P < 0.001) and general adherence to ART (β = 0.201, P = 0.0368). General adherence to ART was negatively associated with depressive symptoms (β = -0.188, P = 0.046) and current heroin use (β = -0.196, P = 0.042). These findings underscore the importance of addressing mental health and social challenges facing people living with HIV with a history of drug use to promote ART treatment adherence. Clinical management of HIV should identify and address concurrent substance use behaviors to maximize adherence and treatment outcomes."

This study explores the role of timing of ART intake, the information patients received from health workers, local adherence patterns, barriers to and facilitators of ART among 28 HIV-positive adults at the Senkatana HIV Clinic in Maseru, Lesotho. This qualitative, semi-structured interview study was carried out during February and March of 2011 and responses were analyzed inspired by the Grounded Theory method. Results were then compared and discussed between the authors and the main themes that emerged were categorized. The majority of the respondents reported having missed one or more doses of medicine in the past and it was a widespread belief among patients that they were required to skip the dose of ART if they were ""late"". The main barriers to adherence were interruptions of daily routines or leaving the house without sufficient medicine. The use of mobile phone alarms, phone clocks and support from family and friends were major facilitators of adherence. None of the patients reported to have been counseled on family support or the use of mobile phones as helpful methods in maintaining or improving adherence to ART. Being on-time with ART was emphasized during counseling by health workers. In conclusion, patients should be advised to take the dose as soon as they remember instead of skipping the dose completely when they are late. Mobile phones and family support could be subjects to focus on during future counseling particularly with the growing numbers of mobile phones in Africa and the current focus on telemedicine. "

The Danish Paediatric HIV Cohort Study includes all patients <16 y of age with HIV-1 infection in Denmark. We report the complete follow-up from 1996 to 2005 of 49 perinatally infected children treated with HAART. Initial HAART included 2 nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors in combination with either a protease inhibitor (n =38) or a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (n =12). 19 (39%) patients were previously treated with mono- or dual therapy. Baseline characteristics were median CD4 percentage 14% and HIV-RNA viral load 4.9 log(10). Within the first 12 weeks of therapy approximately 60% achieved HIV-RNA viral load <500 copies/ml, and this remained stable for up to 8 y, although many children changed the components of HAART. The proportion of children with CD4 percentage >25% increased to 60-70% over the y of treatment. For the total cohort, 245 patient-y of observation were available with only 1 death. During our observation period there were no signs of a waning impact. The challenge remains to maintain a high adherence to therapy as the children grow into adolescence and develop more independence from family and health care staff."

Findings are reported from surveys undertaken with two separate community-recruited samples of drug injectors in London collected in 1992 (n = 505) and in 1993 (n = 507). Anonymized confirmed testing of saliva shows 51.5% of drug injectors in 1992 and 47.9% in 1993 to be antibody positive to the core antigen of hepatitis B virus (anti-HBc). Approximately half of the drug injectors confirmed as anti-HBc positive were unaware that they had been infected with hepatitis. Anti-HIV-1 prevalence was considerably lower at 7.0% in 1992 and 6.9% in 1993. Multivariate analyses showed anti-HBc positivity to be most likely among older injectors with longer injecting careers who had a history of having shared used needles and syringes. HIV-1 positivity was also associated with a history of having shared injecting equipment as well as with recent sharing (i.e. in the last 6 months). Unlike anti-HBc positivity, there were no associations between HIV-1 positivity and age or length of injecting career. Younger injectors with shorter injecting careers were more likely to report recent sharing of used injecting equipment than older injectors with longer injecting careers. We note the potential for continued transmission of HBV and HIV-1, particularly among younger injectors. We recommend an integrated strategy to maximize the health of drug injectors, of which HIV and HBV prevention is a part. There is a need to widen the availability of HBV vaccinations for HBV negative drug injectors and their sexual partners and for clear guidelines to drug injectors about the relative efficacy of bleach to disinfect injecting equipment of HBV and HIV."

The impact of HCV infection on liver function was also assessed. The sera of 726 military recruits were tested for HCV antibodies using second generation ELISA technique (Ortho). The overall prevalence was 330.4%. Considering the presence of hepatitis B and/or schistosomiasis infection, HCV antibodies were detected in 30.0% of HBsAg carriers, 36.8% of bilharzial patients and 48.8% of those with concomitant infections. Among individuals without schistosomiasis or HBV infection, the rate decreased to 22.5% positive with HCV. The present study indicated that parenteral exposure to the virus might be the most important route for acquiring infection, while blood transfusion had a very minor role. The study of the impact of HCV on liver functions revealed that a single infection with HCV only was associated with almost normal liver function tests. However, infection with more than one hepatitis virus revealed a greater impact on the liver function. Morbidity also increased when schistosomiasis infection was superimposed."

Extensive studies of individual promoters have revealed that heterogeneous RNA 5' ends contribute to the complexity of HBV transcriptome and proteome. Here, we provide a comprehensive map of HBV transcription start sites (TSSs) in human liver, HCC, and blood, as well as several experimental replication systems, at a single-nucleotide resolution. Using CAGE (cap analysis of gene expression) analysis of 16 HCC/nontumor liver pairs, we identify 17 robust TSSs, including a novel promoter for the X gene located in the middle of the gene body, which potentially produces a shorter X protein translated from the conserved second start codon, and two minor antisense transcripts that might represent viral noncoding RNAs. Interestingly, transcription profiles were similar in HCC and nontumor livers, although quantitative analysis revealed highly variable patterns of TSS usage among clinical samples, reflecting precise regulation of HBV transcription initiation at each promoter. Unlike the variety of TSSs found in liver and HCC, the vast majority of transcripts detected in HBV-positive blood samples are pregenomic RNA, most likely generated and released from liver. Our quantitative TSS mapping using the CAGE technology will allow better understanding of HBV transcriptional responses in further studies aimed at eradicating HBV in chronic carriers."

Our study estimates the mortality due to liver disease and the role of other risk factors in a Spanish HBV cohort. 2,352 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive and 15,504 HBsAg-negative subjects were identified among blood donors during 1972-1985 and were followed until December 2000 through the Mortality Registry. Clinical examination and an epidemiological questionnaire were performed on 1,000 HBsAg-positive survivors during 1994-1996. In subjects deceased from liver disease, medical records were revised and relatives were interviewed. A nested case-control analysis was conducted comparing both groups. In HBsAg-positive men, an excess mortality from liver cancer [standardized mortality ratio (SMR): 14.1; 7.7-23.6], cirrhosis (SMR: 10.5; 7.0-15.1), haematological neoplasms (SMR: 3.2; 1.2-6.9) and AIDS was detected (SMR: 5.5; 2.2-11.4). In women, an excess was found for cirrhosis (SMR: 7.2; 1.4-21.1). Progression factors to liver disease were alcohol intake [odds ratio (OR): 6.3; 3.1-12.8], diabetes (OR: 3.6; 1.3-9.6), HBV replication (OR: 50.0; 14.9-167.3) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (OR: 27.4; 7.1-107.7). In conclusion, in Spain after 20 years of follow-up, chronic HBV exposure appears as a major risk factor for liver cancer among men and for cirrhosis in both sexes. The risk of death from liver disease among HBV carriers with the presence of HBV replication, HCV, alcohol consumption and diabetes was significantly increased and suggests synergism among these exposures and HBV. Mortality from haematological neoplasms was detected and could be associated to HIV coinfection. These results support screening and adequate follow-up among HBsAg-positive subjects at high risk to develop liver disease, particularly when these risk cofactors are present."

At present, however, there is still no cure for HIV and those undergoing treatment have to do so for life. The use of antiretroviral drugs has been associated with several toxicities that limit their success. Some acute and chronic toxicities associated with these drugs include hypersensitivity reactions, neurotoxicity, nephropathy, liver damage, the appearance of body fat redistribution syndrome and the different metabolic alterations that accompany it. Some of these toxicities are family- or even drug-specific. Since not all patients that take a particular antiretroviral medication develop the adverse effect that has been attributed to that drug, it has therefore been postulated that there must be a genetically-conditioned individual predisposition to developing the adverse effect. Pharmacogenetics is the science that studies interindividual variations in the response to and toxicity of drugs due to variations in the genetic composition of individuals. Sufficient advances have been made in this discipline to allow this fertile field of research to move out of the basic science laboratory and into clinical applications. The present article reviews the investigations that have been published regarding the association between the genetic determinants of persons infected with HIV and the metabolic toxicity and chronic vascular consequences resulting from antiretroviral drugs. The influence of host genetic variants on dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, lipodystrophy and atherosclerosis are presented and discussed."

We describe a case of an HIV-infected heterosexual black African man with a delayed diagnosis of HBV infection. Baseline HBV screening was performed using a sequential testing algorithm starting with a total core antibody (anti-HBc) test, which was negative. He had no evidence of immunity against HBV and subsequently received three unsuccessful courses of HBV vaccination. He had mild but persistent elevation of liver enzymes over a five-year period despite maintaining full suppression of HIV replication on efavirenz, lamivudine and zidovudine; the latter was changed to abacavir due to lipoatrophy. Further testing revealed e-antibody positive chronic HBV infection with undetectable anti-HBc reactivity. High-grade HBV viraemia associated with L180M and M240V drug-resistance mutations was confirmed. He was subsequently switched to a tenofovir-based regimen, which achieved HBV suppression.

Deficiencies in the PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway are associated with autoimmune diseases, including those of the central nervous system (CNS). To understand the role of PD-1 expression in regulating T-cell immunity in the CNS during chronic infection, we characterized PD-1 expression in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood of individuals with chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. PD-1 expression was higher on HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells than on total CD8(+) T cells in both CSF and blood. PD-1 expression on CSF T cells correlated positively with CSF HIV-1 RNA and inversely with blood CD4(+) T-cell counts, suggesting that HIV-1 infection drives higher PD-1 expression on CSF T cells. However, in every HIV-positive individual, PD-1 expression was higher on T cells in CSF than on those in blood, despite HIV-1 RNA levels being lower. Among healthy HIV-negative controls, PD-1 expression was higher in CSF than in blood. Furthermore, frequencies of the senescence marker CD57 were lower on CSF T cells than on blood T cells, consistent with our prior observation of enhanced ex vivo functional capacity of CSF T cells. The higher PD-1 expression level on CSF T cells therefore does not reflect cellular exhaustion but may be a mechanism to downregulate immune-mediated tissue damage in the CNS. As inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is pursued as a therapeutic option for viral infections, potential effects of such a blockade on development of autoimmune responses in the CNS should be considered."

Immunity impairment due to HIV infection can be the cause of a higher rate of HBV replication with less intensive liver damage and less effective immune response to HBV, while the pathological course in both infections involves elevated levels of circulating immune complexes (CIC). These were the reasons for us to examine the frequency of HBsAg involvement as the antigen component of circulating immune complexes formed in sera of HIV-infected patients in different stages of HIV disease. We tested 67 sera of HIV-positive patients in different stages of HIV disease for the presence of HBsAg and HIV antigen p24 (with and without acid dissociation of immune complexes), for the presence of anti-Hbc antibodies and circulating immune complexes. HBsAg was positive in 13.8% sera prior to and 33.8% after acid pretreatment. Anti-HBc antibodies were present in 76.9% serum samples tested. Fifty percent of sera were positive for both HBsAg and p24 antigen after dissociation of immune complexes. The level of CIC was elevated in 65.9% of sera. Our results suggest that HBsAg is commonly associated in immune complexes formed in the sera of HIV-infected patients and that they may simultaneously contain HIV and HBsAg in patients coinfected with both agents. This may contribute to their mutual interaction and influence the diagnosis and follow-up of patients."

Among other reasons, HIV disclosure to one's main partner is believed to be an incentive for serodiscordant couples to practice safe sex. The present article investigated this issue by conducting a cross-sectional survey of a large sample of HIV-infected women attending HIV care centers in Cameroon (N=1014). Overall, 86.3% of these women had disclosed their serostatus to their main partner. With respect to sexual activity with their main partner during the previous three months, 35.0% had practiced abstinence and 47.4% only safe sex, whereas 17.6% had engaged in unsafe sex at least once. HIV disclosure to one's main partner was related to safe sexual practices in multivariate analysis. Some of the factors associated with disclosure and safe sex were illustrative of the positive roles of improved access to care and women's empowerment. On the contrary, beliefs overestimating the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapies were quite widespread among respondents and predictive of both concealment of HIV status and unsafe sex."

It has been suggested that the increased incidence of AVN in this population may be caused by an increased prevalence of predisposing factors for osteonecrosis, including protease inhibitors, hyperlipidemia, corticosteroid use, alcohol and intravenous drug abuse. The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors for avascular necrosis developing in the femoral head of HIV infected individuals. This study consisted of meta-analysis of the secondary data extracted from current literature. The selected articles allowed two study groups to be drawn up for comparison. Group 1 comprised 324 individuals infected by the HIV virus, who did not present femoral head AVN. Group 2 comprised 32 HIV positive patients, who presented femoral head AVN. The parameters used for analysis were as follows: age, gender, sexual preference, use of intravenous drugs, time of diagnosis, CD4+ cell count, use of antiretroviral agents and duration, serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides. The present study found a statistically significant association between hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, sexual preference and intravenous drug abuse. The authors concluded that femoral head osteonecrosis is associated with hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia) and intravenous drug abuse. This study supports the hypothesis that protease inhibitors play a role in the development of osteonecrosis through a tendency to cause hyperlipidemia."

Detection and quantification of HCV RNA in clinical samples of serum or plasma was performed by reverse transcription of viral RNA followed by amplification using DNA real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) with hybridization-fluorescence detection of PCR products in real-time. Statistical analysis was performed using STATISTICA software package. Student's t test was used to evaluate the differences between the means. HCV antibodies were detected in 73 patients out of 181. HCV genotyping showed presence of first genotype in 18 (24.7%), genotype 2 in 19 (26.0%) and genotype 3 in 36 (49.3%) patients. The third genotype was the most prevalent according to our study. More severe immunosuppression was observed in patients with HCV genotypes 1 and 3 in comparison with those with HCV genotype 2. HCV infection is a negative risk-factor in the course of HIV infection, accelerating the decrease of CD4+ cells. The greatest risk of progression of HIV infection to AIDS occurs in the presence of HCV genotype 1 and 3 which can be explained by more aggressive course of the disease and a poorer prognosis in comparison with the infection with genotype 2.

The potential risks of short-term interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during treatment with an autologous dendritic cell immune-based therapy (AGS-004-001) were assessed using data from a subgroup of subjects in the strategies for management of antiretroviral therapy (SMART) study with matched eligibility criteria. A retrospective subgroup analysis of the SMART study population using the eligibility criteria and treatment stopping rules of AGS-004-001 study was analyzed. Key inclusion criteria for AGS-004-001 study were applied to the data collected from participants of the SMART study. There were 440 of 2,720 on the drug conservation arm and 436 of 2,752 on the viral suppression arm that matched the AGS-004-001 inclusion criteria and were used in the SMART subgroup analysis. In the first 16 weeks following randomization into the SMART study there were no deaths in either subgroup. There were two AIDS-related events in the drug conservation subgroup and one in the viral suppression subgroup, making the overall risk of AIDS-related events 2 per 100 person years (0.005%) and 1 per 100 person years (0.002%) in the two subgroups, respectively. There were 6/440 subjects (1.4%) in the drug conservation subgroup and 4/436 subjects (0.92%) in the viral suppression subgroup who experienced Grade 2 adverse events. These results demonstrated that analytical treatment interruption within the context of highly selective, closely monitored studies assessing the antiviral activity of immune-based agents should be an acceptable strategy for at least 16 weeks."

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to detect M. fermentans in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 50 patients enrolled consecutively from an HIV outpatient clinic in 1991 (cohort 1), 56 patients with lower respiratory tract infection who underwent bronchoscopy in 1992 (cohort 2), and 159 patients who were enrolled into a natural history cohort study in 1994 (cohort 3). The incidence of NHL among the patients was determined in 1998. The PBMCs of 29 patients (10.9%) were positive for M. fermentans (8 in cohort 1, 13 in cohort 2 and 8 in cohort 3) and 11 patients (4.2%) developed NHL which was confirmed histologically (3 in cohort 1, 4 in cohort 2 and 4 in cohort 3). We found a statistically significant association between the presence of M. fermentans and the development of NHL in the combined cohort (risk ratio [RR]=6.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.21--20.84], P=0.003 Fisher's exact test [FET]). This association remained significant even after adjustment in a multivariate analysis for CD4 cell count and HIV disease status at the time of M. fermentans testing (RR=7.97 [95% CI=2.16--29.47], P=0.002)."
2613,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Abstract Predictors of successful virologic, immunologic, and clinical response with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) containing a boosted protease inhibitor or a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor were analyzed among an antiretroviral naive (ARV-naive) urban cohort. Measures of success included virologic suppression [HIV-1 viral load (VL) <400 copies/ml], an increase in CD4(+) T cells from baseline of >100 cells/microl, and lack of development of an AIDS-defining illness at 24 and 48 weeks after cART initiation. Two hundred and eighty-seven ARV-naive patients were included in this cohort, of which 76.7% were male and 86.8% were nonwhite. At the time of cART initiation their median age was 39 years, the geometric mean CD4(+) count was 42 cells/microl, and the mean viral load was 5.3 log(10) copies/ml. At 48 weeks, 72% of patients achieved virologic suppression, with > or =90% adherence and high school graduation predicting viral undetectability at 48 weeks. Baseline VL < or =100,000 copies/ml and a CD4(+) cell count >100 cells/microl were associated with viral suppression at 24 weeks [OR (95% CI) = 3.55 (1.29-9.81) and 3.96 (1.19-13.15), respectively]; female gender was associated with a greater increase in CD4(+) cell counts [OR (95% CI) = 7.41 (2.48-22.1)]. CDC stage A1-C2 at baseline predicted lack of clinical progression at 48 weeks. The results of this analysis of an ARV-naive cohort comprised predominantly of indigent, minority patients suggest that men who did not have a high school education and who had advanced HIV infection are less likely to have therapeutic success after cART initiation."
19041,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"In 2014, there were 36.9 million people worldwide living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH), of whom 17.1 million did not know they were infected. Whilst the number of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections has declined globally since 2000, there are still regions where new infection rates are rising, and diagnosing HIV early in the course of infection remains a challenge. Late presentation to care in HIV refers to individuals newly presenting for HIV care with a CD4 count below 350 cells/µl or with an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining event. Late presentation is associated with increased patient morbidity and mortality, healthcare costs and risk of onward transmission by individuals unaware of their status. Further, late presentation limits the effectiveness of all subsequent steps in the cascade of HIV care. Recent figures from 34 countries in Europe show that late presentation occurs in 38.3% to 49.8% of patients newly presenting for care, depending on region. In Switzerland, data from patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study put the rate of late presentation at 49.8% and show that patients outside established HIV risk groups are most likely to be late presenters. Provider-initiated testing needs to be improved to reach these groups, which include heterosexual men and women and older patients. The aim of this review is to describe the scale and implications of late presentation using cohort data from Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe, and to highlight initiatives to improve early HIV diagnosis. The importance of recognising indicator conditions and the potential for missed opportunities for HIV testing is illustrated in three clinical case studies. "

Using the proportional hazards model and multivariate analysis, lack of expression of coccidioidal delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) was found to be dependent on anergy in response to the non-coccidioidal antigens mumps, Trichophyton and Candida (relative hazard 4.2, 95% CI 1.8-9.8, P=0.001). Among subjects with CD4 lymphocyte counts >/=250 microl-1 on entry into the study, the in vitro lymphocyte transformation (LT) response to the coccidioidal antigen toluene spherule lysate was 4967+/-1652 (mean counts per minute (c.p.m.)+/-SEM) in subjects with coccidioidal DTH compared with 136+/-222 in those with negative DTH (P<0.001). However, amongst those whose CD4 count was <250 microl-1, LT responses were low and there was no significant difference based on coccidioidal DTH (P=0.965). Using the proportional hazards model and multivariate analysis, only a CD4 count <250 microl-1 was prognostically associated with the development of either active coccidioidomycosis or AIDS. These data indicate that immunodeficiency, particularly a CD4 lymphocyte count <250 microl-1, is the most important factor in the lack of expression of specific immunity to coccidioidomycosis and in the development of active coccidioidomycosis among HIV-infected individuals living in the coccidioidal endemic area."
13487,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) is frequently observed in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and results from the compromise of subcortical brain structures by the virus. The manifestations of NCI range from asymptomatic impairment to dementia. In addition to cognitive impairment resulting from HIV infection, other factors such as depression are associated with the loss of cognitive functions. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of NCI in HIV-positive patients in a city in southern Brazil and to establish possible associations for the prevalence of NCI with HIV-related and other risk factors. This cross-sectional study of HIV-positive outpatients was conducted in a specialized care service in the city of Pelotas in Southern Brazil. Sociodemographic data and HIV-related information were collected, and all patients underwent psychiatric and neurocognitive evaluations. The prevalence of NCI among the 392 patients was 54.1% when tracked using the IHDS (International HIV Dementia Scale) and 36.2% when the IHDS was associated with a battery of complementary tests. A bivariate analysis suggested an association of NCI with gender, age, educational level, depression, current CD4 count and lowest CD4 count. The association of NCI with depression remained in the Poisson regression (PR=1.96, 95%CI=1.12-3.42). The prevalence of cognitive impairment in HIV-positive patients estimated in this study is in accordance with international and Brazilian data. Of the factors analyzed, depression showed the greatest evidence of association with neurocognitive loss. Based on our findings, the inclusion of instruments to evaluate depression in our services for patients with HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is recommended. "

Thirty-one patients with HCC seen at the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health between 1986 and 1992 were evaluated serologically for evidence of HBV and HCV infection: antibodies to HBV and HCV and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were detected by conventional immunoassays, and HCV RNA and HBV DNA were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Serologic evidence of HBV infection was found in 18 patients (56%), 17 with antibodies, 16 with HBV DNA, and 14 with HBsAg. Evidence of HCV infection was found in 10 patients (32%), seven of whom also had HCV RNA. One patient had both anti-HCV and HBsAg. In comparison to patients with HBV-related HCC, those with HCV-related cancer were older and more likely to be white, to have been born in the United States, to have a history of parenteral exposure, and to have cirrhosis. In two patients in whom the course of hepatitis C could be traced from its onset, hepatocellular carcinoma developed after 5 years in one and after 9 years in another case. Thus chronic HCV infection is a common etiology of cirrhosis among United States patients with HCC, often as a late complication of intravenous drug abuse or blood transfusion."
13560,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"A prospective study was conducted in the Bronx, New York, of 70 infants of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected (n = 33) and uninfected (n = 37) mothers who had a history of intravenous drug use or of intravenous drug-using sex partners. Infants were observed from birth to a median age of 23 months (range 3 to 54 months). HIV infection was confirmed in seven infants (21%) of seropositive mothers; six developed HIV disease, with symptoms observed in the first year. Of these, three died (3, 9, and 36 months) of HIV-related causes; 3 of 4 survivors were greater than 25 months of age. HIV symptoms preceded or were concurrent with abnormalities in T-lymphocyte subsets; postneonatal polymerase chain reaction confirmed HIV infection in five infants with symptoms and one without symptoms. Among infants of seropositive mothers, seven without laboratory evidence of HIV (including polymerase chain reaction) had findings suggestive of HIV infection, including persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, oral candidiasis, parotitis, and inverted T-lymphocyte ratios. These findings were not observed in infants of seronegative mothers. Although the presence of HIV proviral sequences was associated with HIV disease, the observation of indeterminate symptoms in at-risk infants indicates the importance of long-term clinical follow-up to exclude HIV infection. Disease manifestations in comparable infants of seronegative mothers are important for assessment of the impact of maternal drug use, development of specific clinical criteria for early diagnosis of HIV and eligibility for antiretroviral therapy."

The study group consisted of 100 consecutive cases of patients with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis and equal healthy controls matched for age and sex. The patients were included on the basis of detailed history, clinical examination, and liver function profile. HGV RNA was detected in serum samples of all patients as well as of healthy controls using nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The primers used were derived from the NS3 helicase region of the viral genome. Serological assay was used for screening the viral markers for hepatitis B and C (HbsAg and Anti HCV). A history of blood transfusion was recorded in 65% of the cases. HGV RNA was detected in only six out of 100 (6%) cases of chronic renal failure. The seroprevalence of HCV infection was detected in 27 (27%), while HBV infection was seen in 10 (10%) out of 100 cases. The mixed infection of HGV and HCV was seen in 33.3% (two out of six) of the chronic renal failure cases, while the coinfection between HGV and HBV was not observed. In the 100 cases of healthy controls, HGV RNA was detected in only three (3%) subjects. Serological markers for Anti HCV antibody and HbsAg were positive in only one (1%) and two (2%) of the subjects, respectively. The seroprevalence of HGV infection in chronic renal failure was found to be statistically nonsignificant when compared to that of healthy controls. Also, there was no difference in clinical course and liver function profile of HGV-positive and HGV-negative cases. However, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was significantly out of range in HCV-positive patients compared with HCV-negative patients. The presence of HGV infection reflected a postparental exposure to blood and blood-contaminated products in hemodialysis patients. It is suggested that HGV infection in cases of chronic renal failure is unlikely to influence the course of the disease and may be considered an innocent bystander."

Serum samples were tested for HCV antibodies by a second-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and for HCV RNA using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and retested for anti-HCV and HCV RNA three months later. 24 (30%) of 80 hemodialysis patients were anti-HCV positive, and 2 (3.6%) of 56 anti-HCV negative cases were found HCV RNA positive. By combined assessment, the HCV infection rate of hemodialysis patient was 32.5% (26/80). Mantel-Haenszel analysis showed that HCV infection was associated with multi-transfusions, dialysis over a long period, renal transplantation, history of operation. Samples of dialysate in 9 serum HCV RNA positive cases were directly detected for HCV RNA, and 3 were found HCV RNA detectable. HCV infection rate in hemodialysis patients is higher than that of general population. The main risk factors for HCV transmission is transfusion of unscreened blood but is not an independent factor, hemodialysis itself plays an important role, the length of time on dialysis, renal transplantation, blood-contaminated material and contaminated dialysis equipment are also the risk factors. Infected hemodialysis patients should be isolated."

Seven of 14 persistent HBV carrier cases (group A) in which long-lasting HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) carriage in the sera had been confirmed by sequential assays, and 5 out of 15 HBV-infected people (group C, single assay) showed significant primary liver damages including chronic hepatitis, toxic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In 5 cases (group B), one of which was type B liver cirrhosis, HBsAg became negative and HBsAb appeared during the follow-up period (up to 33 months). Among confirmed HBV carriers, HBsAg and HBV core antigen were most frequently found in the liver of cirrhotic cases with and without hepatocellular carcinoma (5 of 6), whereas these were rarely detected in those with non-specific changes or slight hepatitic activity (1 of 7). All 5 cases in group B were negative for histological HBV-related antigens and the findings in group C were variously interpreted. Post-mortem cases of the aged HBV carriers who survived their mean life expectancy represent an important population in which to study the natural history of HBV carriers."

A case-control study approach was applied using pedodontists as zero-exposure controls. The study further allowed serologic and epidemiologic follow-up of dentists who participated in a similar study in 1976. The authors sought to determine whether exposure to hepatitis B virus in this population sometimes leads to immunization without infection (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) positivity only). A total of 922 dentists (22% of all Danish dentists) gave blood; of these, 254 (28%) participated in the 1976 study. Serum samples were tested using commercial solid phase radioimmunoassays. The prevalences of anti-HBs and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) were 7.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.7-9.0) and 5.2% (95% CI = 3.8-6.6), respectively. Twenty-one dentists (31%) only had anti-HBs (without prior vaccination). Age-standardization of the two data sets (1976 and 1985) indicated no substantial change in seroprevalence. Private practitioners, especially those working in Copenhagen, had an increased odds ratio (OR) of being seropositive compared with that of pedodontists (OR = 3.0 (95% CI = 1.3-6.8) adjusted for age and sex and OR = 2.4 (95% CI = 1.1-5.2) adjusted for age and site of practice). The proportion attributable to occupational exposure was approximately 50%. In a logistic regression model, site of practice and type of specialty were associated with hepatitis B virus seropositivity (p = 0.01 and 0.05, respectively), whereas age, sex, hours of oral surgery per week, and use of gloves were not. Four persons had become seropositive in the follow-up study, for a seroconversion rate of 0.2% per year. Seven out of 18 dentists who were anti-HBs positive in 1976 were found to be anti-HBs negative in 1985. Most of these dentists had values below 10.0 units by S/N ratio (ratio of counts per minute of sample compared with the mean number of counts per minute of negative controls). The findings do not justify institution of a large-scale vaccination program for dentists, but there are certain subgroups of dentists which constitute candidates for vaccination."

While the overall increased risk for mortality associated with HIV care discontinuation is well established, the reasons for HIV care nonadherence among HIV-infected postpartum women are largely unknown. Eighteen HIV-infected women were recruited from four clinics in Alabama to participate in focus groups or individual interviews to discuss barriers and facilitators impacting postpartum HIV care adherence. Sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded; content analysis was used to analyze the verbatim transcripts. Mixed methods analysis procedures were used to triangulate data from three sources (focus group transcripts, individual rankings of barriers and facilitators according to the Nominal Group Technique, and individual questionnaires of sociodemographic and adherence data). The majority of participants were African-American (83.3%), single (66.7%), with more than half of the participants living on less than $1000 a month (55.6%). Barriers to retention in HIV care included access to and cost of transportation and fitting HIV care into work and childcare schedules. Facilitators to HIV care adherence included wanting to stay healthy for their own well-being as well as for the care of their children, receiving family support, and appointment reminders. The current study highlights contextual factors contributing to poor HIV care adherence among HIV-infected postpartum women. Intervention studies need to be cognizant of the specific needs of HIV-infected postpartum women to improve long-term clinical outcomes among this population, who have children. "

These simple adherence measures are inexpensive and easy to administer; however, require validation and adjustment prior to implementation. The objective of this study was to define the optimal adherence assessment measure in Namibia to identify patients at risk for sub-optimal adherence and poor virologic response 6 months after ART initiation. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in HIV-infected adults receiving ART for 6-12 months prior to the adherence assessment. Adherence measures included 30-day VAS, 30-day Likert item, self-reported treatment interruptions, PIT, and MPR. Association of adherence measures with 6-month HIV-1 RNA level was assessed using two thresholds (1000 copies/mL and 5000 copies/mL). Adherence was assessed in 236 patients, mean age 37.3 years, 54% female. Mean adherence was 98.1% by 30-day VAS, 84.7% by 30-day Likert item, 97.0% by self-reported treatment interruptions, 90.6% by PIT, and 98.8% by MPR. Agreement between adherence measures was poor using kappa statistic. 76% had HIV-1 RNA <1000 copies/ml, and 88% had HIV-1 RNA <5000 copies/ml. MPR (continuous) was associated with viral suppression <5000 copies/ml (p = 0.036). MPR <75% was associated with virologic failure at ≥5000 copies/ml with OR 3.89 (1.24, 12.21), p = 0.013. Adherence was high with all measures. Only MPR, was associated with short-term virologic response, suggesting its cross-culturally utility for early identification of patients at high risk for virologic failure."

We describe the experiences of 69 HIV-infected individuals who were enrolled in a community-based modified directly observed therapy (MDOT) program. Participants were referred by their primary care physicians based on nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy, and/or active substance use. A near-peer outreach worker initially delivered medications to participants 5 to 7 days per week, with visits subsequently tapered to 1 to 3 days per week after 3 or more months. Questionnaires were completed and laboratory values were obtained at baseline, 1 month, and every 3 months after enrollment. At enrollment, 96% of participants had a history of substance use, 71% had a history of incarceration, and 93% were experienced with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). At the time of their 6-month assessment visit, 31 of 69 participants were receiving observed therapy visits. The median baseline plasma viral load (PVL) was 4.8 log, and the median individual change in PVL from baseline to 6 months among participants receiving MDOT was a decrease of 2.7 log. Reasons why participants were not receiving visits included medication holidays, hospitalization or assisted living, incarceration, discontinuation of program involvement, and death. These results support that MDOT should be included in the spectrum of options available to enhance adherence to HAART among patients who are unsuccessful with self-administration of their medications."

A Bayesian approach is proposed to fit this model to clinical data from ACTG A5055, a study of two dosage regimens of indinavir (IDV) with ritonavir (RTV) in subjects failing their first protease inhibitor treatment. The HIV RNA testing was completed at days 0, 7, 14, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, and 168. An intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation was performed on day 14 and multiple trough concentrations were subsequently collected. Pill counts were used to monitor adherence. IC(50) for IDV and RTV were determined at baseline and at virologic failure. Viral dynamic model fitting residuals were used to assess the significance of covariate effects on long-term virologic response. As univariate predictors, none of the four PK parameters C(trough), C(12 hour), C(max), and AUC was significantly related to virologic response (p > 0.05). By including drug susceptibility (IC(50)), or IC(50) and adherence measured by pill counts together, C(trough), C(12 hour), C(max) and AUC were each significantly correlated to long-term virologic response (p = 0.0055,0.0002,0.0136,0.0002 with IC(50) and adherence measured by pill counts considered). The IC(50) and adherence measured by pill counts alone were not related to the virologic response. In predicting virologic response adherence measured by pill counts did not provide any additional information to PK parameters (p = 0.064), to drug susceptibility IC(50) (p = 0.086), and to their combination (p = 0.22). Simple regression approaches did not detect any significant pharmacodynamic (PD) relationships. Any single factor of PK, adherence measured by pill counts and drug susceptibility did not contribute to long-term virologic response. But their combinations in viral dynamic modeling significantly predicted virologic response. The HIV dynamic modeling can appropriately capture complicated nonlinear relationships and interactions among multiple covariates."

This is a retrospective chart analysis comparing the trends in CD4+ count and viral load in two populations of 21 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients, one on methadone maintenance and a methadone non-using group. Each methadone user was matched with a control methadone non-user that had a similar CD4+ at the beginning of the study. For the CD4+ count we compared the slope of regression for each couple of patients. In 15 patients we also collected the viral load, which was measured at 4-6 monthly intervals. The mean length of follow-up was 811 days for the methadone group and 797 days in the control group. There was no statistical difference in the treatment received by the two groups of patients during the study. The slope of regression of CD4+ count showed a significantly steeper decline in the methadone-using patients compared with the methadone non-users (r= 0.487; p< 0.05). The evolution of the HIV-1 RNA levels was the same during the follow-up of mean 186 months in a few of the patients in each of the two groups. Long-term methadone use was associated with a significantly faster decrease of CD4+ count in HIV-1 affected patients compared with methadone non-users. HIV-1 RNA data were found in too few patients to enable any conclusions about the development of viral load in the two groups."

A retrospective analysis of TB cases was performed, occurring from January 1995 to December 2010 in our cohort of 599 HIV positive patients. The primary outcome was the occurrence of active TB. Forty-one TB cases were diagnosed over this period of 16 years, among 599 HIV positive patients in an open cohort setting in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. All-time lowest mean CD4 T cell count at the time of TB diagnosis was 146 and 186 cells/mm³, respectively. The mean HIV viral load was 5.19 log10 copies/mL, and 59% of the patients were on HAART. TB incidence was 1.47 per 100 person-years, for a total follow-up time of 2775 person-years. The probability of surviving up to 10 years after diagnosis was 75% for TB patients as opposed to 96% for patients with other, non-TB opportunistic diseases (p = 0.03). TB can be considered a public health problem among people living with HIV in Brazil despite of the widespread use of antiretrovirals for the treatment of HIV infection/AIDS."

The study population included a total of 120 antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected patients, 110 neuroasymptomatic patients, and 10 with neurologic complications. HIV-1 RNA was quantified in cell-free CSF and plasma using polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Roche Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor version 1.5, Roche Diagnostic Systems, Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., Base, Switzerland). Immunoactivation was measured by CSF-serum IgG index, CSF neopterin concentrations, and CSF monocytic cell count. The CSF HIV-1 RNA load did not differ significantly between patients with or without neurologic complications. In patients without neurologic symptoms, the CSF monocytic cell counts were correlated to the CSF viral load (r(s) = 0.40, p < .001), whereas IgG index and CSF neopterin concentrations were correlated to the viral load only in the subgroup of patients with CD4 counts > or =200 x 10(6) cells/L. In this subgroup of patients, the peripheral CD4 cell count was, as expected, inversely correlated to the CSF viral load (r. = -0.36, p < .01), whereas in patients with CD4 counts <200 x 10(6) cells/L, an unexpected, significant positive correlation (r(s) = 0.43, p < .01 ) was found. In HIV-1-infected patients with neurologic complications, no significant correlations were found between immune activation, CSF viral load, and immunosuppression."
6484,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"In people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) both the CD4 T-cell count and the viral load are used to monitor disease progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). CD4 counts of <500/mm(3) are associated with opportunistic infections and certain malignancies, so-called 'AIDS-defining' conditions. Highly active antiretroviral therapy, using combinations of reverse transcriptase inhibitors and/or protease inhibitors, can improve considerably the prognosis of people who are HIV-positive, but such therapy is not yet widely available in many developing countries. People with AIDS are predisposed to urinary tract infection (UTI) by uncommon bacteria and pathogens, e.g. fungi, parasites and viruses, which may affect any urogenital organ; treatment should be culture-specific and long-term, because there is a tendency to recurrence, infection with multiple organisms and resistant isolates. Voiding dysfunction in patients with AIDS is usually a result of neurological complications caused by opportunistic infections, and has a poor prognosis. Of patients with AIDS, 30-50% develop a cancer, especially Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). KS may involve any urogenital organ, but is usually part of systemic disease. Small lesions on the external genitalia can be treated with laser, cryotherapy or surgical excision, larger lesions with radiotherapy, and disseminated or visceral KS with multidrug chemotherapy. NHL may involve the kidneys, testes and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, thus obstructing the ureters, which may require ureteric stenting or percutaneous nephrostomy. NHL can be treated with radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy. Urolithiasis in patients with AIDS may be caused by indinavir, a protease inhibitor, but the more common types of stones may also occur. Fluid-electrolyte and acid-base disturbances are common in patients with advanced AIDS, secondary to vomiting, diarrhoea, malnutrition or septicaemia. HIV-associated nephropathy occurs in 10-30% of patients, and often leads to renal failure. Testicular atrophy is common, leading to infertility, erectile dysfunction (ED) and decreased libido. Treatment for ED must include counselling about strategies to reduce the transmission of HIV. The risk of HIV transmission after parenteral exposure to blood from an HIV-positive patient is relatively low (0.2-0.4%); the urologist can reduce the risk of transmission during surgery by adopting certain precautions. After occupational exposure to HIV, chemoprophylaxis with antiretroviral medication can significantly reduce the probability of HIV transmission."
8870,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"AIDS-related mortality among HIV-positive adolescents has risen by 50% despite the scale up of antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART maladherence likely plays a role in the increase of AIDS-related deaths among adolescents and has shown to be associated with psychosocial and mental health difficulties. Addressing the specific mental health needs of HIV-positive adolescents is critical to ending the HIV epidemic. This cross-sectional study prospectively enrolled HIV-positive adolescents (12-24 years) in Moshi, Tanzania. A structured questionnaire was administered that included questions about home, school, adherence, and measures of stigma (Berger Stigma Scale) and mental health. Mental health measures included depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), emotional/behavioral difficulties (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), and traumatic experiences/post-traumatic stress symptoms (The University of California Los Angeles-post-traumatic stress disorder-Reaction Index). Mental health difficulties were prevalent among HIV-positive adolescents and were associated with incomplete adherence and stigma. Resources are needed to reduce HIV stigma and address mental health among HIV-positive adolescents in low-resource settings. This will improve not only mental health, but may also improve ART adherence and virologic suppression, improving overall health of the individual and reducing the risk of HIV transmission to others."
14656,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The prerequisite for an 'undetectable' HIV viral load has restricted access to transplantation for HIV-infected kidney recipients. However, HCV-infected recipients, owing to the historic limitations of HCV therapy in patients with renal disease, are commonly viremic at transplant and have universal access. To compare the effect of HIV, HCV, and HIV/HCV coinfection on kidney transplant patient and allograft outcomes, we performed a retrospective study of kidney recipients transplanted from January 1996 through December 2013. In multivariable analysis, patient (hazard ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.66-1.24) and allograft survival (0.60, 40-0.88) in 492 HIV patients did not differ significantly from the 117,791 patient-uninfected reference group. This was superior to outcomes in both the 5605 patient HCV group for death (1.44, 1.33-1.56) and graft loss (1.43, 1.31-1.56), as well as the 147 patient HIV/HCV coinfected group for death (2.26, 1.45-3.52) and graft loss (2.59, 1.60-4.19). HIV infection did not adversely affect recipient or allograft survival and was associated with superior outcomes compared with both HCV infection and HIV/HCV coinfection in this population. Thus, pretransplant viral eradication and/or immediate posttransplant eradication should be studied as potential strategies to improve posttransplant outcomes in HCV-infected kidney recipients. "

This study evaluated a newly designed LightCycler based quantitative cccDNA PCR assay. A linear range of 2.5 x 10(1) to 1 x 10(9) copies/assay using primers specific for HBV cccDNA and 2.5 x 10(1) to 2.5 x 10(9) copies/assay using primers specific for total HBV DNA (tDNA) was established. beta-Globin was used to estimate the number of cells in each PCR reaction. Enzymatic digestion with an ATP-dependent DNase improved the analytic specificity to a greater than 1:10000 ratio of cccDNA:RC DNA (relaxed circular DNA). One-tenth of the extracted DNA from 1mg of liver biopsy, was analyzed from six patients, three HBV-infected and three uninfected individuals, under blinded conditions; three were found positive and three negative for cccDNA and tDNA. Approximately 6 x 10(3) copies of cccDNA/mg of tissue were detected in a pre-transplant biopsy from an HBV-infected patient treated with lamivudine. Sequential post-transplant liver biopsies were negative for both HBV cccDNA and tDNA. An HBV-infected patient with cirrhosis who was antiviral therapy naïve had 3.7 x 10(4) copies of cccDNA/mg of liver tissue. Another treatment-naïve patient with a history of high HBV viral load had 1 x 10(5) copies of cccDNA/mg of tissue (4 x 10 (6) copies of tDNA/mg of tissue). Further studies are warranted but the high level of sensitivity, specificity, rapidity and accuracy provided by this novel assay with the LightCycler system indicate that it could be useful for monitoring antiviral therapy."

However, the mechanisms underlying such cancer outgrowth are still unknown. Furthermore, combined HIV/cancer studies are difficult to evaluate using primate models or in the clinical patient setting. To understand the mechanisms of tumor outgrowth in the context of HIV infection, we adopted a humanized mouse model permissive to infection and cancer as well as an in vivo humanized mouse challenge with colon cancer in the context of HIV infection. Immunodeficient NOD SCID IL-2R(-/-) mice were immunologically reconstituted by adoptive transfer of 10(7) HIV-negative donor peripheral blood leukocytes and challenged with 10(6) HCT116 human colon cancer cells. A group of mice was treated with antiretroviral therapy. Tumor microenvironment and epithelial tissues in the context of HIV infection were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. We demonstrate that HIV-infected humanized mice develop significantly larger tumors than uninfected mice (p<0.05). Epithelial cell proliferation in HIV-infected mice is significantly enhanced in comparison to proliferation in uninfected mice (p<0.01). Moreover, the activation of β-catenin, an important step in intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, is elevated in the tumors of HIV-infected mice (p<0.0001). Importantly, antiretroviral therapy reverses these pathological processes independently of CD4(+) T cell return. These findings model the ability of HIV infection to result in tumor outgrowth that is evident in HIV-positive patients and lend insight into previously unrecognized mechanisms that may underlie this pathology."
16820,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, an acyclic nucleotide analog of adenosine monophosphate, is the most recent addition to the antiretroviral arsenal. After conversion to tenofovir by diester hydrolysis, subsequent phosphorylation by cellular enzymes to form the active tenofovir diphosphate is necessary for antiretroviral activity. Preliminary data suggest that tenofovir is as safe and efficacious as stavudine when given in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz for the treatment of antiretroviral-naïve patients. In antiretroviral-experienced patients, the addition of tenofovir to stable background antiretroviral therapy resulted in approximately a 0.6 log10 copies/ml reduction in viral load relative to placebo. Extended follow-up suggests that such virologic gains may be durable. In vitro, recombinant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) expressing the K65R mutation showed a 3-4-fold increase in the 50% inhibitory concentrations of tenofovir when compared with wild type. In vivo, this mutation thus far appears to occur infrequently and is associated with variable virologic responses. Response rates to tenofovir vary with the number and pattern of thymidine analog mutations present before starting treatment with this agent. Tenofovir appears to be a well-tolerated agent in patients who are heavily pretreated and who have advanced disease. The main adverse effects appear to be gastrointestinal in nature and include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In animals, osteomalacia and nephrotoxicity have occurred with tenofovir at exposures much higher than those observed in humans. Although no patient had to discontinue therapy as a result of elevated creatinine levels or hypophosphatemia through 58 weeks of treatment, the toxicities associated with long-term tenofovir therapy in humans are unknown. Concomitant administration of tenofovir and didanosine increases the area under the concentration-time curve of the latter by 44-60%; monitoring for signs and symptoms of didanosine toxicity is recommended. The approved dosage of tenofovir is 300 mg (one tablet) once/day with meals. Given the ease of administration and relative safety from the perspectives of adverse effects and drug interactions, tenofovir has the potential to assume a large role in the treatment of patients with HIV infection."

The patient sought medical care complaining of increased volume in the right mandibular angle and imaging tests showed an extensive radiolucency with undefined boundaries compromising the mandibular border. After the incisional biopsy, the patient had a pathological fracture in the region, which was properly treated in a second surgical procedure using a 2.4-mm reconstruction plate. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive marking for CD3, CD79a, Ki67, and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA. The treatment consisted of concurrent antiretroviral therapy with chemotherapy with rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. Examinations of images (2 years postoperatively) revealed complete bone repair and absence of injury recurrence. This work is important because it describes an unusual location of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and shows the importance of diagnosis and treatment of the injury at an early stage in order to promote the prognosis and survival of patients."

The first study was a cross-sectional evaluation of 207 untreated patients. In this study, the proportion of patients with hematologic disorders increased with disease progression. There was a significant inverse correlation between HIV-1 plasma viral load and all hematologic values (r = -0.266 to -0.331). The second study was a longitudinal evaluation of patients on combination antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with hematologic alterations before treatment ( N = 27 with platelets <150,000/microl, 24 with hemoglobin <12 g/dl, 36 with neutrophils <2000/microl and 29 with leukocytes <3000/microl). Samples were analyzed every 3 months for 2 years. At 2 years, >50% of patients experienced a sustained virologic response, with viral loads <500 RNA copies/ml. Hematologic reconstitution occurred progressively for all blood cell lineages and became statistically significant after the sixth month of therapy ( p <.001). Mean values increased from 110 to 180 x 10(3)/microl for platelets, from 10.7 to 12.3 g/dl for hemoglobin (stabilizing finally at 11.4 g/dl), from 1,260 to 2,240/microl for neutrophils, and from 2,260 to 3,600/microl for leukocytes. In conclusion, hematologic disorders are corrected by combination antiretroviral therapy. This suggests a causative role of HIV-1 in hematologic disorders."

A 27-year-old Bulgarian woman received a kidney transplant from a cadaveric donor owing to chronic renal failure due to glomerulonephritis of unknown etiology. Five days after the donation, the tissues showed HIV-1 infection, so she was immediately initiated on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with lopinavir/ritonavir, zidovudine, enfuvirtide, and lamivudine. Subsequently, according to the genotypic test which revealed a complex resistance pattern of the HIV-1, we changed the regimen to darunavir/ritonavir, etravirine, lamivudine, and enfuvirtide. The HIV-1 genome (550 UI/mL), which was detected at 5 days after transplantation, rapidly declined to undetectable levels at 3 weeks after HAART. The CD4+ T-cell nadir was 432 cells/microL (40%) to 1,400 cells/microL after 2 years. The posttransplantation course was complicated by cytomegalovirus pneumonia. At 32 months after transplantation, the patient had experienced hypertension with secondary retinopathy, bilateral cataracts, diabetes, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis with multiple vertebral fractures, a hip prosthesis, and a bone infarction of the femur. Major management problems had been related to steroid and HAART treatment side effects. Therapeutic interactions between the immunosuppressants and the antiretroviral drugs were complex for management, requiring frequent checks of drug levels and dose-adjustments. We finally obtained a stable clinical and viroimmunologic condition. The transmission of multiresistant strains of HIV from unknown patients requires complex multidisciplinary management."

The study population included 70 homosexual men (11 of whom were prostitutes), 58 bisexual men (19 of whom were prostitutes), 101 female prostitutes from three socioeconomic groups, 13 wives of men with hemophilia who were seropositive for HIV-1 antibodies, and 47 blood donors with positive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory tests for syphilis, all from Rio de Janeiro; 86 female prostitutes from two rural towns in Minas Gerais; 133 patients with AIDS from São Paulo; and 196 men with bleeding disorders who were seropositive for HIV-1 antibodies on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The prevalence of HIV-1 infection was highest in the homosexual male prostitutes (45 percent), the wives of patients with hemophilia (38 percent), the bisexual men (28 percent), the homosexual men who were not prostitutes (19 percent), and the female prostitutes from the lower class (9 percent). Combined HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection was found in 3 percent of the patients with AIDS and in 1 percent of the homosexual men. The prevalence of HTLV-I infection ranged from 1 percent in rural female prostitutes to 13 percent in HIV-1-positive men with bleeding disorders in Rio de Janeiro. Combined HIV-1 and HTLV-I infection occurred in 1 to 11 percent of some male subgroups. We conclude that in Brazil HIV-1 infection is already well established among homosexuals, bisexuals, and lower-class female prostitutes, with bisexual men probably acting as a bridge between the heterosexual and homosexual communities, that HTLV-I infection is prevalent in groups at risk for AIDS, and that HIV-2 infection has already been introduced into the country."

They included a polyclonal enzyme immunoassay (EIA), a monoclonal EIA, and a monoclonal EIA after immune complex dissociation (ICD) of specimens. Subjects were grouped into two categories defined by real-time testing with the polyclonal EIA: 39 had become positive for p24 antigen (antigen converters) during follow-up, and 48 had progressed to AIDS without detectable antigenemia. Twenty-four (61%) antigen converters were positive by ICD-monoclonal EIA about 1 year earlier than by monoclonal EIA. In contrast, only 12 (25%) patients who progressed to AIDS without detectable antigenemia became positive by ICD-p24 EIA before developing AIDS. Thus, the main benefit of ICD treatment may be to detect p24 antigenemia approximately 1 year before the regular assay rather than to identify additional antigenemic people. Quantitative plasma RNA levels were also determined in longitudinal samples from 20 antigen converters and 7 men who developed AIDS without antigenemia. Although mean human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA levels were higher in antigen-positive than in antigen-negative samples (P = 0.002), more than half (11 of 20) of the antigen converters had no measurable change in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA associated with change to antigen positivity."

Liver transplantation (LT) is the best therapeutic option for patients with end-stage liver failure caused by HBV. The success of transplantation, though, depends on receiving prophylactic treatment against post-transplant viral reactivation. In the absence of prophylaxis, liver transplantation due to chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is associated with high rates of viral recurrence and poor survival. The introduction of treatment with hepatitis B immunoglobulins (HBIG) during the 1990s and later the incorporation of oral antiviral drugs have improved the prognosis of these patients. Thus, LT for CHB is now a universally accepted option, with an estimated 5 years survival of around 85% vs the 45% survival seen prior to the introduction of HBIG. The combination of lamivudine plus HBIG has for many years been the most widely used prophylactic regimen. However, with the appearance of new more potent oral antiviral agents associated with less resistance (e.g., entecavir and tenofovir) for the treatment of CHB, new prophylactic strategies are being designed, either in combination with HBIG or alone as a monotherapy. These advances have allowed for more personalized prophylaxis based on the individual risk profile of a given patient. In addition, the small pool of donors has required the use of anti-HBc-positive donors (with the resulting possibility of transmitting HBV from these organs), which has been made possible by suitable prophylactic regimens.

To evaluate HIV-1 genetic diversity and drug resistance-associated mutations among drug-naive patients in Kenya prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART), a genetic analysis of HIV-1 pol-RT and env-gp41 was performed on samples collected from 53 (18 males and 35 females) consenting patients between April and June 2005. The average age, baseline CD4(+) T cell counts, and viral loads were 38 (range, 24-62) years, 475 (range, 203-799) cells/mm(3), and 4.7 (range, 3.4-5.9) log(10) copies/ml, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 40 samples (75.5%) were concordant subtypes for the two genes and 13 (24.5%) were discordant, suggesting possible recombination and/or dual infections.

Similar to other observations made in other HCV-infected patient populations, treatment of chronic HCV infection that results in sustained virologic response or eradication of the hepatitis infection has been strongly associated with decreased likelihood of end-stage liver disease and/or hepatocellular carcinoma and improved overall survival in HIV-infected patients. However, the effectiveness of HCV treatment has been limited due to frequent contraindications to interferon-α (INFα) and prior to the advent of HCV direct acting antivirals, relatively low rates of sustained virologic response. Since 2011, the efficacy of HCV treatment in coinfected patients has improved substantially with the addition of HCV direct-acting antivirals to INFα-based regimens. Based on these observations, there is mounting optimism that INFα-free, oral HCV treatments will further improve efficacy, and more importantly, increase access to treatment for many coinfected patients.

The present work aims to elucidate further the effect IR state on early viral kinetic response to Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy and the impact of HCV treatment and viral eradication on insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using the HOMA-IR method. All enrolled patients were treated with a dual therapy (pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin) for 48 weeks and evaluated using qRT-PCR for early virologic response as well as the impact of treatment on insulin sensitivity throughout the early period of therapy. Of a total 392 chronic HCV cases, early virologic response was achieved by 318 (81.1%). IR was detected in 241 (61.5%) chronic HCV patient of which 73.4% responded to treatment. Early virologic response among patients with > 2.18 HOMA-IR value were significantly lower than those with HOMA-IR values ≤2.18 (P < 0.0001). IR was significantly associated with high baseline BMI. Steatosis and fibrosis correlated with IR but neither independently predicted early virologic response. Pretreatment IR < 2.18, low fasting blood glucose, low and intermediate HCV viral load, normal BMI, and non-smoking were independent factors associated with early virologic response. IR interferes with early virologic response to the antiviral care. Clinical application of pretreatment HOMA-IR assessment could help in predicting early treatment outcome and thus enable treatment regimens to be optimized and individually tailored."

When CD4+ lymphocyte level was controlled for, women prescribed zidovudine during pregnancy were less likely to transmit HIV-1 to their infants (adjusted odds ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.92). There was no conclusive evidence that efficacy of zidovudine depended on CD4+ lymphocyte level, suggesting that women with severe CD4+ cell depression, who are at highest risk of transmitting HIV-1, may also benefit from zidovudine. Antenatal zidovudine treatment alone may substantially lower the risk of perinatal HIV-1 transmission. These data are consistent with the results of AIDS Clinical Trial Group protocol 076 and suggest that a substantial portion of zidovudine's protective effect may occur when used during the antenatal period."

IFN-gamma signaling is mediated through the ligand binding to IFN-gamma receptor 1 (IFNGR1). Control of IFNGR1 expression level is one of the mechanisms by which cells modulate the potency of IFN-gamma signaling. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IFNGR1 gene and correlated their occurrence to susceptibility to HBV infection in a Chinese population. A total of 983 participants, including 361 chronic hepatitis B patients, 256 individuals who had spontaneously recovered from HBV infection, and 366 healthy control subjects, were enrolled in the study. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to identify seven SNPs (-611A/G, -56C/T, 40G/A, 95C/T, 130A/G, 20685A/G, 21227T/C) in IFNGR1 gene. We found that -56C and -56T allele were associated with viral clearance and viral persistence, respectively (P = 0.014). In a reporter-driven assay, we validated that the promoter variant with -56C exhibited a higher transcription level than that with -56T in HepG2 cells in a cell-type-specific pattern. We conclude that a functional -56C/T SNP in IFNGR1 promoter is associated with the clinical outcome of HBV infection in this Chinese population."

Therefore, characterizing such persons can help direct prevention efforts to a group who are likely to be continuing sources of HIV transmission. We assessed the incidence and factors associated with trichomoniasis in a cohort of HIV-infected women receiving care at a public clinic in Los Angeles County, California from 1992 through 1995. Demographic, clinical, and behavioral data were available from medical records and from patient interviews. Trichomonas infection was the most frequently identified sexually transmitted disease and was found in 37 (17.4%) of 212 women representing a crude incidence rate of 14.1 per 100 person-years experience. The crude rate of trichomoniasis was highest in black women (69.0 per 100 person-years), women with a history of trading sex for drugs or money (51.0 per 100 person-years), those using crack or cocaine (35.5 per 100 person-years), women with four or more sex partners (43.0 per 100 person years), and those born in the United States (23.3 per 100 person-years). Among women with severe immunosuppression (CD4+ count < 200), 18.4% (18 of 98) were diagnosed with trichomoniasis. After multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazards approach, black race (adjusted rate ratio [RR] = 5.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.3, 13.3) continued to be strongly associated with Trichomonas infection. Trading sex for money or drugs (adjusted RR = 25.2, 95% CI = 4.3, 148.6) and single marital status (adjusted RR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.1, 13.0) were independent risk factors for trichomoniasis in nonblack women but not among black women. Data from this study indicate that Trichomonas may be a frequently acquired infection in HIV-positive women. Our findings suggest that HIV-infected women who are black, and nonblack women who trade sex for money or drugs or are unmarried, are at increased risk of trichomoniasis and therefore may be more likely to transmit HIV infection. Local HIV prevention strategies should target such women for intervention efforts."

HIV treatment as prevention (TasP) is rapidly becoming an important public health strategy to reduce HIV transmission at the population level. Data for this study were collected on a sample of 11,397 HIV-positive individuals in the Ryan White system, a publicly funded system of care for HIV-positive individuals in Los Angeles County who are uninsured, in 2009 to examine two components of TasP: baseline rates and factors associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) use and viral load (VL) suppression in a publicly funded system of care. ART coverage among our sample was 90%. In multivariate analyses, those with a higher odds of having unsuppressed VL included: females compared to males (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.06, 1.47); African Americans compared to whites (AOR=1.42; 95% CI=1.24, 1.62); men who have sex with men compared to heterosexuals (AOR=1.15; 95% CI=1.00, 1.32); recent substance abusers compared to nonsubstance abusers (AOR=1.35; 95% CI=1.17, 1.55); those recently incarcerated or ever incarcerated compared to those never incarcerated (AOR=1.37; 95% CI=1.15, 1.63; and AOR=1.28; 95% CI=1.09, 1.50); and those retained in care compared to those not retained in care (AOR=1.98; 95% CI=1.76, 2.22). Understanding the key sociodemographic, geographic and behavioral factors associated with ART use as well as HIV VL suppression will be useful for informing the development and deployment of targeted programming and policies that may further enhance the implementation of the TasP approach in communities across the United States."

Overall rates of HIV infection in pregnant women had already reached 10% in 1987, and have increased only modestly since then. In contrast, in 1992-1993, rates in men with sexually transmitted diseases and in female commercial sex workers reached 27 and 86%, respectively. The increases in infection rates have been largely due to transmission of HIV-1, whereas rates of HIV-2 have remained stable or have declined. Among persons with tuberculosis and hospitalized patients, rates of 46-71% have been reached, increases in recent years again being largely attributable to HIV-1. Among the 15,245 AIDS cases reported by Projet RETRO-CI, a steady decline in the male:female sex ratio has occurred over time, from 4.8:1 in 1988 to 1.9:1 in 1993. It is likely that AIDS cases were initially concentrated among a core group of female commercial sex workers and their male clients. A substantial proportion of sex workers and their clients originate from neighboring countries, and migration is likely to have contributed to the spread of HIV infection in West Africa. Including HIV-associated pulmonary tuberculosis as an AIDS-defining illness increased AIDS cases reported by Projet RETRO-CI by 13% in 1993. Despite a need for interventional research, careful description of the evolution of HIV/AIDS in this region remains essential."

This study assessed the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV infection and also compared the prevalence of malnutrition in terms of an inadequate diet, underweight, stunting, and wasting among HIV-infected and uninfected children less than 5 years in Bobo-Dioulasso city, Burkina Faso.This was a case-control study matching for age and sex in 164 HIV-infected and 164 HIV-uninfected children. The sociodemographic characteristics of mothers and children, household food security, drinking water source, child feeding and care practices, and child anthropometric data such as body weight, height, and mid-upper arm circumference were collected.The prevalence of food insecurity and inadequate diet was 58% and 92% of children less than 5 years of age, respectively. The prevalence of underweight, stunting, and wasting was 77% versus 35%, 65% versus 61%, and 63% versus 26% in HIV-infected and uninfected children less than 5 years of age, respectively. Out of 164 HIV-infected children, 59% were on ART initiation during data collection and the median of CD4 cell counts was 1078 cells/μL. HIV-infected children on ART had greater CD4 cell counts (P = .04) and higher weight-for-age Z (P = .01) and weight-for-height Z scores (P = .03) than those without ART. HIV infection was a risk factor for those who had inadequate dietary intake [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-3.62, P = .04]. In addition, HIV-infected children were more likely of being underweight (AOR = 10.24, 95% CI 4.34-24.17, P < 0.001) and wasting (AOR = 5.57, 95% CI 2.49-12.46, P < 0.001) than HIV-uninfected children less than 5 years of age.High prevalence of malnutrition was observed in HIV-infected children compared with HIV-uninfected children.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of BPC observed by HIV-infected patients and their attending physicians and to assess the impact BPC had on daily life. In this epidemiologic multicenter study, patients with HIV infection and their treating physicians filled out parallel questionnaires about their perceptions of specific BPC and their impact on daily activities. A total of 965 patient-physician questionnaires were collected across 98 health centers. Patient's mean age was 43.7 +/- 8.5 years and 72.6% were men. Adjusted prevalence of perceived BPC by patients and physicians was 55.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 52.0-58.1) and 55.2% (95% CI: 52.1-58.2), respectively (p = 1.000). Overall patient-physician agreement concerning perception of BPC was 83% (p < 0.0005). The most common BPC was lipoatrophy, described by 46.8% (95% CI: 43.7-49.8) of patients and 49.4% (95% CI: 46.3-52.5) of physicians (p = 0.033) followed by lipohypertrophy. No gender differences were observed in the global prevalence of BPC (p = 0.649). However, significantly more women reported lipoatrophy of the lower limbs (p = 0.009) and buttocks (p = 0.007), as well as lipohypertrophy (p = 0.007), than men; 58.2% (95% CI: 54.0-62.4) patients noted that BPC negatively affected their daily activities. This study reflects the high prevalence of patient and physician-perceived BPC in the HIV population, and the adverse impact on daily life.

To determine whether HLA polymorphism influences HIV-1 susceptibility, a longitudinal cohort of highly HIV-1-exposed female sex workers based in Nairobi, Kenya, was prospectively analyzed. Decreased HIV-1 infection risk was strongly associated with possession of a cluster of closely related HLA alleles (A2/6802 supertype; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-0.72; P=.0003). The alleles in this supertype are known in some cases to present the same peptide epitopes for T cell recognition. In addition, resistance to HIV-1 infection was independently associated with HLA DRB1*01 (IRR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.06-0.60; P=.0003), which suggests that anti-HIV-1 class II restricted CD4 effector mechanisms may play an important role in protecting against viral challenge.

The primary end points of the study were the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA level and CD4 cell count responses. Fifty-six subjects were enrolled and were changed from amprenavir-containing regimens to the 4-drug regimen. Overall, at week 48, 33 (59%) of 56 subjects had HIV RNA levels <500 copies/mL (intent-to-treat analysis, where missing values equal > or =500 copies/mL) and CD4 cell counts increased by 94 cells/mm(3) from baseline. Subjects who had previously taken amprenavir combination therapy were more likely to experience virologic failure than those who had taken amprenavir monotherapy (odds ratio, 7.7; P=.0012).

Treatment consisted of 400 mg of nevirapine, after a 2-week lead-in dose of 200 mg. Rash was the most frequently reported adverse event, occurring in 25%. While sustained declines in p24 antigen levels were observed in the majority, serum HIV-1 RNA load and CD4 cell counts returned to baseline values within 12 weeks in virtually all subjects. The resistance-conferring tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution at reverse transcriptase position 181 was detected after 4 weeks in most subjects.

Knockdown of human TRIM5alpha by RNA interference eliminated the As(2)O(3) effect, demonstrating that the drug acts by modulating the activity of this retroviral restriction factor. In contrast, HIV-1 infectivity in target cell lines from other primate species (Cercopithecus tantalus, Macaca mulatta, and Aotus trivirgatus) was not increased by As(2)O(3), despite the potent TRIM5-dependent HIV-1 restriction activity that these cells exhibit. To determine if As(2)O(3) responsiveness is characteristic of particular TRIM5 orthologues and not others, TRIM5 cDNAs from these five primate species were transduced into cat fibroblasts, which lack endogenous HIV-1 restriction activity and, therefore, responsiveness to As(2)O(3). In this context, the HIV-1 restriction activity conferred by all TRIM5 orthologues was largely eliminated by As(2)O(3). The effect of As(2)O(3) on HIV-1 restriction is thus shared by different TRIM5 orthologues but dependent on factors specific to the cell line in which TRIM5 is expressed."

In affected glomeruli, proliferating podocytes adhere in aggregates to form glomerular pseudocrescents and fill an enlarged Bowman's space. Previously, we reported that sidekick-1 (sdk-1), an adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily, was highly up-regulated in HIV-1 transgenic podocytes. In the current work, we explore how sdk-1 overexpression contributes to HIVAN pathogenesis. Murine podocytes infected with HIV-1 virus expressed significantly more sdk-1 than control-infected cells. Podocytes stably transfected with an sdk-1 expression construct grew in large aggregates with a simplified morphology characterized by a disorganized actin cytoskeleton, changes similar to podocytes in HIVAN. In contrast to controls, HIV-1 infected podocytes adhered to stably transfected sdk-1 podocyte aggregates in mixing studies. Furthermore, substrate-released cell sheets of wild-type podocytes were readily dissociated by mechanical stress, whereas HIV-1 podocytes remained in aggregates. The number of HIV-1 podocyte aggregates was significantly reduced in cells expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) construct specific for sdk-1 compared with cells expressing control shRNA. Finally, in a HIVAN mouse model, sdk-1 protein was detected in podocytes in collapsed glomerular tufts and in glomerular pseudocrescents. These findings suggest that sdk-1 is an important mediator of cellular adhesion in HIV-infected podocytes and may contribute to podocyte clustering that is characteristic of pseudocrescent formation in HIVAN."

The trial was terminated prematurely after interim analysis performed because of a case of severe encephalopathia in the G-CSF group. At that point 11 HIV infected patients with a CD4+ T cell count < 350/mm3 had been randomized to the G-CSF group (n = 6) or placebo group (n = 5). In both groups plasma HIV RNA decreased significantly in response to HAART. However, plasma HIV RNA changed significantly different between the two groups with the decrease being less pronounced in the G-CSF group (P = 0.02). The concentrations of CD4+ memory T cells and CD8+ naive and memory T cells increased in response to HAART, and there was a trend towards more pronounced increases in several T-cell subpopulations in the G-CSF group. The CD56+ NK cells increased significantly more in the G-CSF group compared with placebo (P = 0. 000). All patients in the G-CSF group reported bone pain.

We abstracted 2001 patient visit data from medical records using standardized data forms. Provider practice was compared to the 2000 Brazil national guidelines for ARV use. Providers who prescribed recommended or acceptable regimens were considered as having conformed to guidelines. Only 2% of patient records (N=984) reported use of inappropriate regimens as defined by the Brazil 2000 national ARV guidelines. Forty-nine per cent of patients at the Evandro Chagas hospital, 17% of those at Hospital Geral, and 57% of those at Centro da Saude were prescribed recommended therapies. Twenty per cent of patients seen at the public district hospital received dual ARV therapy, an acceptable regimen at the time. Although the national guidelines do not provide recommendations on laboratory monitoring, during the 1 year study period a majority of patients had at least one CD4+ cell count (92%) or viral load measurement (86%).

Although chronic HCV infection begins as an asymptomatic condition with few short-term effects, it can progress to cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and death. The rate of new HCV infections is decreasing, yet the number of infected people with complications of the disease is increasing. In the United States, people born between 1945 and 1964 (baby boomers) are developing more complications of infection. Men and African Americans have a higher prevalence of HCV infection. Progression of fibrosis can be accelerated by factors such as older age, duration of HCV infection, sex, and alcohol intake. Furthermore, insulin resistance can cause hepatic steatosis and is associated with fibrosis progression and inflammation. If more effective therapies are not adopted for HCV, more than 1 million patients could develop HCV-related cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, or HCC by 2020, which will impact the US health care system.

Men who knew they were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were significantly more optimistic about not developing AIDS than men who knew they were seronegative for HIV. This AIDS-specific optimism was related to higher perceived control over AIDS and to active coping among seropositive men only and to health behaviors in both serostatus groups. There was no relation of optimism to risk-related sexual behavior. It is concluded that optimism is psychologically adaptive without necessarily compromising health behavior.

Hypertension prevalence was 19.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 14.7-23.5): 23.9% in men and 17.7% in women (P=0.10). Diabetes was diagnosed in 4 women. Hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol >5.00 mmol/mL) was found in 32.2% (95% CI 27.0-37.5), low HDL cholesterol (<1.20 mmol/mL) in 45.7% (95% CI 40.1-51.3) and elevated LDL cholesterol (>4.10 mmol/mL) in 9.5% (95% CI 6.2-12.8); these prevalences were not different between sexes, whereas hypertriglyceridemia (>2.25 mmol(mL) (15.8%, 95% CI 11.7-19.9) was significantly more frequent in men (28.4% versus 12.2%, P=0.002). TC and LDL-C were positively correlated with CD4+ cell count (r=0.13, P=0.03 and r=0.12, P=0.03). In this sample, the traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease had a high prevalence, despite the young age of our patients. Women seemed to be at higher risk than man, unlike other HIV populations where these comparisons were made (Uganda, Italy and Norway). Obesity and lipid abnormalities, highly prevalent in the general population, also appeared related to HIV-infection and CD4+ cell count, presumably as a consequence of ART exposure. Further studies are needed in order to survey a population where HIV infection is turning into a chronic disease, with its complications."
5889,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) often display neurological complications in late stage disease and increased viral loads directly correlated with higher concentrations of extracellular HIV-1 viral protein r (Vpr) in the blood serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Additionally, HIV-1-infected patients with a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count displayed lower concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH), the main intracellular antioxidant molecule, and lower level of survival. To establish a correlation between increased concentrations of extracellular Vpr and an oxidative stress-induced phenotype, the U-87 MG astroglioma cell line has been used to determine the downstream effects induced by Vpr. Conditioned media obtained from the human endothelial kidney (HEK) 293 T cell line transfected either in the absence or presence of HIV-1 Vpr contained free Vpr. Exposure of U-87 MG to this conditioned media decreased intracellular levels of both adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and GSH. These observations were recapitulated using purified recombinant HIV-1 Vpr both in U-87 MG and primary human fetal astrocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Vpr-induced oxidative stress could be partly restored by co-treatment with the antioxidant molecule N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). In addition, free Vpr augmented production of reactive oxygen species due to an increase in the level of oxidized glutathione (GSSG). This event was almost entirely suppressed by treatment with an anti-Vpr antibody or co-treatment with NAC. These studies confirm a role of extracellular Vpr in impairing astrocytic levels of intracellular ATP and GSH. Studies are underway to better understand the intricate correlation between reductions in ATP and GSH metabolites and how they affect neuronal survival in end-stage disease."

In a retrospective analysis of 594 patients (72.9% male; baseline CD4 cell count, 216 cells/microL) receiving care at YRG Center for AIDS Research and Education, a tertiary HIV referral center in southern India, the mean duration of survival from serodiagnosis was 92 months. Ninety-three percent of the patients acquired infection through heterosexual contact. The most common acquired immune deficiency syndrome-defining illnesses were pulmonary tuberculosis (49%; median duration of survival, 45 months), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (6%; median duration of survival, 24 months), cryptococcal meningitis (5%; median duration of survival, 22 months), and central nervous system toxoplasmosis (3%; median duration of survival, 28 months). Persons with a CD4 lymphocyte count of <200 cells/microL were 19 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.56-64.77) more likely to die than were those with CD4 cell count of >350 cells/microL. Patients who had > or =1 opportunistic infection were 2.6 times more likely to die (95% CI, 0.95-7.09) than were those who did not have an opportunistic infection. Antiretroviral therapy for patients with low CD4 lymphocyte counts improved the odds of survival (odds ratio, 5.37; 95% CI, 1.82-15.83)."

These conditions collectively affect more than 50% of people living with HIV/AIDS and adversely impact adherence to HIV therapy. Thus, identification of early markers of neurocognitive impairment could lead to interventions that improve psychosocial functioning and slow or reverse disease progression through improved treatment adherence. Evidence has accumulated for the role and function of microRNAs in normal and pathological conditions. We have optimized a protocol to profile microRNAs in body fluids. Using this methodology, we have profiled plasma microRNA expression for 30 age-matched, HIV-infected (HIV(+) ) patients and identified highly sensitive and specific microRNA signatures distinguishing HIV(+) patients with cognitive impairment from those without cognitive impairment. These results justify follow-on studies to determine whether plasma microRNA signatures can be used as a screening or prognostic tool for HIV(+) patients with neurocognitive impairment. J. Cell.

This study examines four cases of fibrillary glomerulonephritis and two cases of immunotactoid glomerulopathy in association with HCV infection. Findings at presentation included proteinuria, renal insufficiency, and hematuria. Renal biopsy revealed a membranoproliferative pattern of glomerular disease in five cases, and a membranous glomerulopathy with mesangial proliferative features in one. On immunofluorescence, all cases stained with IgG and C3. Electron microscopy revealed fibrils of the expected diameter, 16 to 28 nm in fibrillary glomerulonephritis and 33 to 45 nm in immunotactoid glomerulopathy. In only one case were cryoglobulins detected (at low titer and on only one of three assays). Antiviral therapy was not given in any of the six cases. Outcomes were mixed, with progression to renal failure occurring in two patients and persistent proteinuria with stable or improved renal function in three. Follow-up is not available on the sixth case. Both fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy have features that overlap with cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis. The relatedness of these three entities in a subset of patients with HCV infection suggests a common pathogenic mechanism of glomerular deposition of organized deposits."

The complex health and social issues associated with living with HIV mean that people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) have historically often turned to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). This article provides an overview of the literature on HIV and CAM. Databases were searched using keywords for CAM and HIV from inception to December 2012. Articles in English and in Western countries were included; letters, commentaries, news articles, articles on specific therapies and basic science studies were excluded. Of the 282 articles identified, 94 were included. Over half reported prevalence and determinants of CAM use. Lifetime use of CAM by PLWHA ranged from 30% to 90%, with national studies suggesting CAM is used by around 55% of PLWHA, practitioner-based CAM by 15%. Vitamins, herbs, and supplements were most common, followed by prayer, meditation, and spiritual approaches. CAM use was predicted by length of time since HIV diagnosis, and a greater number of medications/symptoms, with CAM often used to address limitations or problems with antiretroviral therapy. CAM users rarely rejected conventional medicine, but a number of CAM can have potentially serious side effects or interactions with ART. CAM was used as a self-management approach, providing PLWHA with an active role in their healthcare and sense of control. Clinicians, particularly nurses, should consider discussing CAM with patients as part of patient-centered care, to encourage valuable self-management and ensure patient safety."

Proviral DNA was extracted from 54 blood samples and amplified by polymerase chain reaction of protease, reverse transcriptase, integrase, and envelope genes. At least 4 clones per sample were analyzed. Of 54 HIV-1 strains, 45 (83.3%) had a concordant subtype or circulating recombinant form (CRF) designation: 40 CRF02_AG, 2 subtype A1, 2 G, and 1 F2. The remaining 9 (16.7%) had a discordant subtype: 6 subtype A1/CRF02_AG, 2 D/CRF02, and 1 G/CRF02. Protease inhibitor-associated primary resistance mutations were found in 4 (7.4%) cases: M46L with full clones in 1 case, and M46I, M46L, and V82A as minor populations in 1 case each. Reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated primary resistance mutations were found in 5 (9.8%) samples: Y188C in 2 cases, and L100I, M184V, and V75I in 1 case each, although all of these mutations were found as minor populations. This is one of the first reports of the emergence of primary ART resistance mutations among drug-naive, non-B subtype HIV-1-infected individuals in Cameroon. Follow-up studies should be conducted to assess whether these drug-resistant mutants found as minor populations might impact future ART."
4097,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Therapeutic goals for HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy include minimizing risk of future physical disability. Presarcopenia and sarcopenia precede age-associated physical disability. We investigated their prevalence and the predictive value of patient mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) for them. Eighty community-dwelling patients ≥45 years old demonstrating durable viral suppression were evaluated. Sarcopenia was defined as low skeletal muscle index (SMI, skeletal muscle kg/height m(2)) and either low strength or poor performance by handgrip dynamometry and gait speed, respectively. Presarcopenia was defined as low SMI only. MUAC was interpreted according to National Health Statistics percentile. Prevalence of sarcopenia and presarcopenia was 5.0% and 20.0%, respectively. Male gender (odds ratio [OR] 10.72; P < .026), recreational psychoactive substance use (OR 5.13; P < .037), and intravenous drug use transmission category (OR 6.94; P <.0327) were associated with presarcopenia. Higher body mass index (OR 0.80; P < .0007), MUAC (OR 0.83; P < .024), and large skeletal frame (OR 0.09; P < .003) were negatively associated with presarcopenia. Finding that a participant did not have a MUAC <25th percentile on physical examination had a 90.4% negative predictive value for presarcopenia. Although sarcopenia was uncommon, presarcopenia was highly prevalent in midlife and older HIV-infected males. Determination of MUAC percentile may identify those least likely to demonstrate skeletal muscle deficit and improve patient selection for mass and function testing. "

HIV-1-infected women, who received prophylactic ART during pregnancy, had genotypic resistance testing performed at the start (T1) of and 24 weeks after ART interruption (T2). The women had CD4 counts >250 cells/ml and no AIDS defining conditions. Of the 30 eligible women, the median age was 27 years [25-75% interquartile range (IQR): 21-32] and the median gestational age of ART initiation was 22 weeks (IQR: 19-27): 19 (63.3%) received zidovudine (ZDV) plus lamivudine (3TC) plus nelfinavir (NFV). At entry, most women (96.7%) were asymptomatic (CDC93 A1/A2), with a median CD4 count of 446 (IQR: 353-686) and median viral load (VL) of 8560 copies/ml (IQR: 3,252-19,515). No HIV-1 vertical transmission was observed. HIV subtype B was the most prevalent (70%). The development of new mutations associated with ART resistance was analyzed at T2. NFV resistance was observed in 4 out of 17 (23.5%) patients exposed to this drug: two major mutations D30N (1/17) and L90M (1/17) and minor mutations (N88S, 2/17). Mutations on positions 44, 69, and 118 (1/28) were present on reverse transcriptase (RT) analysis. No new nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-associated mutation was observed. In this cohort, ART regimens were very efficient at blocking HIV vertical transmission. However, the high rate of NFV-resistant mutations observed in the postpartum period indicates the need for discussion of ART choices during pregnancy and the potential impact on future therapeutic options for these women. Women previously exposed to ART for PMTCT who will start HIV treatment should have genotypic resistance testing performed."

Development of lipoatrophy was analyzed in stratified and multivariate analyses for its relationship to immunologic, virologic, clinical, and drug treatment information for each patient. Of 337 patients with no lipoatrophy at Survey 1, 44 (13.1%) developed moderate or severe lipoatrophy between the two surveys. In multivariate analyses, significant risk factors for incident lipoatrophy were white race (OR = 5.2; 95% CI: 1.9-17.1; =.003), CD4 T-lymphocyte count at Survey 2 less than 100 cells/mm3 (OR = 4.2; 95% CI: 1.3-13.1; =.013), and body mass index (BMI) less than 24 kg/m2 (OR = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.1-5.4; =.024). Analyses that controlled for the severity of HIV illness demonstrated no significant association with use of or time on any antiretroviral agent or class of agents and the development of lipoatrophy. Some host factors and factors associated with previous or current severity of HIV infection, especially CD4 T-lymphocyte cell count, appeared to have the strongest association with incidence of lipoatrophy."
3910,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy has significantly improved the typical course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in industrialized nations, and life expectancies associated with the infection have increased. However, infection rates have generally remained unchanged, with increases noted among certain subpopulations. The use of systemic preexposure prophylaxis for HIV infection has been proposed as an intervention to reduce the risk of disease transmission in at-risk individuals. The basis of this prophylaxis involves the orchestrated use of antiretrovirals in uninfected individuals either continuously or just before high-risk situations, such as perinatal and occupational exposure to HIV, in order to reduce the likelihood of successful HIV infection. Data from the use of antiretrovirals to prevent HIV infection in these scenarios support the concept of preexposure prophylaxis. Preliminary animal studies have focused on the use of antiretrovirals to prevent simian immunodeficiency virus infection in macaque monkeys, and these data have provided support for the potential efficacy of preexposure prophylaxis for HIV in humans. Limited human data are available, however, but studies are ongoing. Clinical trials have focused on the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate either alone or in combination with emtricitabine. Tenofovir-emtricitabine-based regimens may be ideal, given the drugs' pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. Some investigators have surveyed at-risk individuals to assess their knowledge of preexposure prophylaxis and whether they used or intended to use this prevention strategy. Routine use of preexposure prophylaxis and even knowledge of its existence appear to be very limited. If efficacy is proved, use of preexposure prophylaxis faces several ethical issues. Ultimately, its success will depend on proof of cost-effectiveness. Until the many questions concerning optimal use of preexposure prophylaxis for HIV are answered, however, its use should be limited to research-related clinical investigations."

The epidemiology of the regional pandemic has been changing with the spread of HIV-1 to lower-risk populations through sexual transmission. Common HIV-1 genotypes include subtype B and circulating recombinant form (CRF) 01_AE. Our objective was to use HIV-1 genotypic data to better quantify local epidemics. TASER-M is a multicenter prospective cohort of HIV-infected patients. Associations between HIV exposure, patient sex, country of sample origin and HIV-1 genotype were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression. Phylogenetic methods were used on genotypic data to investigate transmission relationships. A total of 1086 patients from Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines were included in analyses. Proportions of male patients within countries varied (Thailand: 55.6%, Hong Kong: 86.1%, Malaysia: 81.4%, Philippines: 93.8%; p < 0.001) as did HIV exposures (heterosexual contact: Thailand: 85.7%, Hong Kong, 46.2%, Malaysia: 47.8%, Philippines: 25.0%; p < 0.001). After adjustment, we found increased subtype B infection among men who have sex with men, relative to heterosexual-reported exposures (odds ratio = 2.4, p < 0.001). We further describe four transmission clusters of eight to 15 treatment naïve, predominantly symptomatic patients (two each for subtype B and CRF01_AE). Risk-group subpopulations differed with respect to the infecting HIV-1 genotype. Homosexual exposure patients had higher odds of being infected with subtype B. Where HIV-1 genotypes circulate within countries or patient risk-groups, local monitoring of genotype-specific transmissions may play a role in focusing public health prevention strategies. Phylogenetic evaluations provide complementary information for surveillance and monitoring of viruses with high mutation rates such as HIV-1 and Ebola. "

The aims of this study were (1) to assess the independent prognostic values of HBsAg and anti-HCV in a large renal transplant population, (2) to compare infected patients with noninfected patients matched for factors possibly associated with graft and patient survival, and (3) to assess the prognostic value of biopsy-proven cirrhosis. Eight hundred thirty-four transplanted patients were included: 128 with positive HBsAg (group I), 216 with positive anti-HCV (group II), and 490 without serological markers of HBV and HCV (group III). Fifteen percent and 29% of patients were HBsAg-positive and anti-HCV-positive, respectively. Ten-year survivals of group I (55 +/- 6%) and group II (65 +/- 5%) were significantly lower than survival of group III (80 +/- 3%, P <.001). At 10 years, among overall patients with HCV screening (n = 834), four variables had independent prognostic values in patient survival: age at transplantation (P <.0001), year of transplantation (P =.02), biopsy-proven cirrhosis (P =.03), and presence of HCV antibodies (P =.02). In the case control study, comparison of infected patients with their matched control patients showed that age at transplantation (P <.05), HBsAg (P =.005), and anti-HCV (P =.005) were independent prognostic factors. HCV, biopsy-proven cirrhosis, and age are independent prognostic factors of 10-year survival in patients with kidney grafts. The case-control study showed that anti-HCV and HBsAg were independently associated with patient and graft survivals. In infected patients, a routine liver histological analysis would improve selection of patients for renal transplantation."
