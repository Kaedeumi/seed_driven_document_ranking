The onset of possible cardiovascular involvement was considered. Forty HIV patients (29 men and 11 women, mean age 39.13 +/- 7.82 years, range 28-61 years) treated with HAART for 12-43 months were evaluated for fat, lean, bone tissues, immunohematological and cardiovascular alterations. The differences in fat/lean tissues and bone mineral density were evaluated at dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Serum lipids and the CD4/CD8 T-cell counts were recorded. ECGs were taken every 6 months; color Doppler echocardiography and color Doppler ultrasounds of the carotid vessels were performed in close chronological sequence with the second DEXA. Statistical analyses included: Student's t-test, Wilcoxon test, and single-multiple regression analysis. Thirteen patients presented with fat loss, 7 fat accumulation, and 20 a combined form of both. The changes in the single body districts showed that the decrease in the limb fat is to be attributed to protease inhibitors, while none of the three variables was responsible for the decrease in the upper limb fat. The trunk weight increase was not significant. The decrease in the lean mass of the upper limbs is to be attributed to protease inhibitors, while none of the three variables was responsible for the increase in the lean mass of the upper and lower limbs. The decrease in bone mineral density was not significant. No treatment-related cardiovascular lesions were observed. In HIV patients treated with HAART for 12-43 months, the decrease in lower limb fat was due to protease inhibitors. Neither osteopenia nor cardiovascular diseases were observed during follow-up.

DC are potent accessory cells for a number of T cell-mediated immune responses, including autologous and allogeneic mixed leukocyte reactions, and mitogen- and antigen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. In the present study, DC purified from human peripheral blood were inoculated with various strains (IIIB, SF2, WMJ1, SF162, 89.6 and clone HXB2) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) displaying different patterns of cellular tropism. Viral replication was demonstrated by detection of p24 antigen (Ag) intracellularly and in culture supernatants, and by Southern and Northern blot analyses for the presence of HIV DNA and RNA, respectively, within infected cells. Cell-free and cell-associated p24 Ag levels rose substantially when DC were inoculated with strains SF162, 89.6 and clone HXB2. In contrast, p24 Ag levels rose only marginally after inoculation of DC with strains IIIB, SF2 and WMJ1. Purified DC did not express detectable membrane CD4, although CD4 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase PCR. The presence of anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies failed to block infection of DC by any of the HIV strains tested, suggesting the existence of a CD4-independent alternative pathway of viral entry. The possibility that DC serve as a reservoir for HIV-1 must be considered.

They considered patients' levels of cluster of differentiation (CD) 4(+) cells and viral load, and they attempted to verify whether patients with baseline biochemical signs of bone mineral density loss could experience osseointegration impairment.

In the present study, we aimed to determine whether HIV-1 in the bone marrow of TP patients can infect primary megakaryocytes in vitro, which may contribute to the development of thrombocytopenia. We amplified the V3 loop of HIV-1 envelope from the bone marrow of TP and non-TP patients and constructed recombinant viruses. We demonstrate that the bone marrow of TP and non-TP patients contained R5 strains, whereas X4 strains were present only in the bone marrow of TP patients. Furthermore, HIV-1 from the bone marrow of TP and non-TP patients infected megakaryocytes to similar levels, suggesting that the V3 loop of HIV-1 may not contain the viral determinants of HIV-associated TP. Chemokine receptor analysis determined that CD34+-cell-derived megakaryocytes express CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5 and are productively infected by both X4 and R5 HIV-1 isolates. Finally, we showed that CD34+-cell-derived megakaryocytes express the chemokine receptor CCR3.

The goal of this study was to determine if sclerostin is related to bone physiology and cardiovascular disease during antiretroviral treatment in HIV-infected persons. This was a cross-sectional analysis from study entry into the Stopping Atherosclerosis and Treating Unhealthy bone with RosuvastatiN in HIV (SATURN) trial, an ongoing randomized trial comparing rosuvastatin to placebo in HIV-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy. Plasma sclerostin was measured at study entry by ELISA from participants with available samples. Spearman correlation and multivariable linear regression were used to test relationships between sclerostin and bone density or bone turnover and cardiovascular disease. Among 139 HIV-infected participants (median age 46 years, CD4 lymphocyte count 614 cells/μl), the median plasma sclerostin level was 444.1 (IQR 330.3, 570.1) pg/ml. Correlations were detected between sclerostin and age (r=0.26), lumbar spine Z-score (r=0.31), RANKL (r=-0.21), carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT, r=0.19), and sVCAM-1 (r=0.27), p<0.05. No significant correlations were detected between sclerostin and current (r=0.006) or nadir CD4 count (r=0.11). While associations between sclerostin, lumbar spine Z-score, and sVCAM-1 were robust to covariate adjustment (p<0.01), association with CIMT was no longer significant (p=0.08). Our findings provide preliminary support for a relationship between sclerostin and bone mineral density in HIV-infected persons. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway should be investigated as a potential mechanism for loss of bone mineral density in treated HIV infection.

As low bone mineral quality (BMQ) in patients can be considered a marker of possible degeneration in osteopenia and osteoporosis in adulthood, we evaluated bone features in a pediatric population. Forty-four patients (23 females, 21 males; aged 3-17 years) were compared with a control population (1227 healthy children: 568 females, 641 males; aged 3-18 years). Seven patients were CDC stage C, 18 B, and 18 A. All patients were vertically infected; four were naive to any antiretroviral treatment, seven were taking two NRTIs, and 32 were on HAART. BMQ was assessed by a quantitative ultrasound (QUS) technique. It measures the amplitude-dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS, m/sec) and the bone transmission time (BTT, microsec). QUS values were significantly lower in cases than in controls, even after adjustment for age and body size (AD-SoS: 1924.7 +/- 64.9 and BTT: 0.97 +/- 0.3 in controls; AD-SoS: 1879.7 +/- 57.2 and BTT: 0.80 +/- 0.32 in cases; p < or = 0.001). The associations of AD-SoS and BTT with gender, type of therapy, and CDC stages were not significant. AD-SoS and BTT were significantly associated with age (r = 0.59, p < 0.0001), skeletal age SDS (r = 0.46, p = 0.002), height (r = 0.66, p < 0.0001), and therapy duration (r = 0.31, p = 0.04). Both AD-SoS and BTT values in patients fell below mean values of controls. Follow-up of bone mineral density is important in patients to prevent long-term problems of skeletal status.

At entry into prenatal care, the mean CD4 cell count for this cohort of patients was 406 cells/mm(3) (95% CI: 373-438 cells/mm(3)), while the mean HIV RNA was 24,394 copies/ml (95% CI: 18,275-30,513 copies/ml). Thirty-six women (16%) had detectable antiretroviral-resistant mutations. By 34 weeks gestation, 75% had achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/ml. Our logistic regression model showed the odds of harbouring antiretroviral-resistant virus with a baseline CD4 cell count of <200 cells/mm(3) was eight times that of subjects with CD4 cell counts >500 CD4 cells/mm(3) (95% CI 1.5-42.73). Six infants were HIV infected, four born to mothers with detectable viraemia at 34 weeks and two born to mothers who were lost to follow up. Antiretroviral resistance is common in prenatal care but did not increase vertical transmission if viral load was appropriately suppressed. Genotyping should be considered in Brazil in order to assist initiation of appropriate combination antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy to suppress viral load to avoid vertical transmission.

Morphology and clinical correlation., Abstract: To determine the true incidence of abnormalities in bone marrow specimens from patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the clinical significance of these abnormalities regarding their cause and their role in the production of hematologic complications, 216 bone marrow biopsies, aspirates, and/or imprint preparations from 178 patients who either were seropositive for HIV infection or met the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were studied. Detailed morphologic review was performed in a blind fashion as to clinical status. Extensive clinical, therapeutic, and laboratory data were collected for each patient. Statistical analysis was performed to detect significant correlations between morphologic findings and clinical/therapeutic/laboratory features. Among the most common bone marrow findings were hypercellularity (53% of specimens), myelodysplasia (69%), evidence of reticuloendothelial (RE) iron blockade (65%), megaloblastic hematopoiesis (38%), fibrosis (20%), plasmacytosis (25%), lymphocytic aggregates (36%), and granulomas (13%). A number of statistically significant correlations between morphologic findings and clinical features were noted. No significant association was detected between any morphologic finding and therapy with a variety of drugs. In 7 of 14 (50%) patients found to have marrow involvement by malignant neoplasm, the bone marrow represented the initial site of diagnosis of the neoplasm. Most of the bone marrow abnormalities associated with HIV infection appear to be related directly to the infection or its complications and not to therapeutic intervention. In certain clinical situations, bone marrow examination continues to be useful in the management of patients infected with HIV.

Their pathogenesis may differ from primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and is associated with various factors including the virus itself or the antiretroviral therapy. In order to evaluate the differences between HIV-related MDF and MDS, the morphological changes in peripheral blood and bone marrow, cytogenetic analysis and the response to anaemia treatment were studied in 158 HIV+ patients with haemophilia and the results were compared with those of 61 patients with primary MDS (31 with RA, 10 with RARS, 11 with RAEB, three with RAEB-t and six with CMML). The eligibility criteria for patients with MDS were primary MDS, Hb levels < 10 g dL(-1), and no significant organ disease. The peripheral blood and bone marrow examination revealed MDF in 44 HIV-infected haemophilic patients (27.8%). The median time from seroconversion was 12.5 years and the mean time under AZT therapy was 44.1 months. Nineteen of these patients (43.1%) had Hb levels < 10 g dL(-1), while neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 29.5% and 25%, respectively. Every patient of this study with Hb < 10 g dL(-1) received erythropoietin (Epo). There were statistically significant morphological alterations between HIV-related MDF and MDS: hypocellularity, plasmatocytosis and eosinophilia were more pronounced in HIV haemophiliacs with MDF, while dysplasia of erythroblasts, megakaryocytes and granulocytes was more frequent in MDS patients. No HIV haemophilic patient with MDF had more than 5% blasts in the bone marrow nor did any develop RAEB or acute leukaemia during the period of this study. The cytogenetic analysis was normal in HIV-infected patients with haemophilia whereas 42.6% of patients with MDS had an abnormal karyotype. Complete erythroid response was achieved with Epo administration in 84.2% of HIV+ haemophilic patients with anaemia compared to 19.7% of patients with MDS. These data suggest that bone marrow changes in long-term HIV patients have different characteristics from primary MDS and constitute the entity for which the name HIV-myelopathy has been proposed in the literature.

A case of spontaneous supracondylar femoral fracture that occurred in a 58-year-old monk during meditation is reported. His AIDS disease was controlled with combination antiretroviral therapy. Vitamin D and calcium had been added 3yr before since osteoporosis was detected by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). At the time of the fracture, the patient was on treatment with 35mg every week of sodium risedronate, 1000mg of calcium, and 400IU of Vitamin D every day. Clinical use of DXA for HIV patients should be considered as a routine measure to help reducing risk for fractures.

We designed a trial to characterize these parameters after interruption of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients who had maintained prolonged viral suppression on antiretroviral drugs. Eighteen patients with CD4(+) T cell counts >/= 350 cells/microliter and viral load below the limits of detection for >/=1 year while on HAART were enrolled prospectively in a trial in which HAART was discontinued. Twelve of these patients had received prior IL-2 therapy and had low frequencies of resting, latently infected CD4 cells. Viral load relapse to >50 copies/ml occurred in all 18 patients independent of prior IL-2 treatment, beginning most commonly during weeks 2-3 after cessation of HAART. The mean relapse rate constant was 0.45 (0.20 log(10) copies) day(-1), which was very similar to the mean viral clearance rate constant after drug resumption of 0.35 (0.15 log(10) copies) day(-1) (P = 0.28). One patient experienced a relapse delay to week 7. All patients except one experienced a relapse burden to >5,000 RNA copies/ml. Ex vivo labeling with BrdUrd showed that CD4 and CD8 cell turnover increased after withdrawal of HAART and correlated with viral load whereas lymphocyte turnover decreased after reinitiation of drug treatment. Virologic relapse occurs rapidly in patients who discontinue suppressive drug therapy, even in patients with a markedly diminished pool of resting, latently infected CD4(+) T cells.

The effect of HAART on HCV coinfections is controversial. We describe the case of a patient, in whom a close temporal relationship between changes in HIV viremia, HCV viremia and ALT levels was observed. Longterm suppression of HIV replication by HAART was associated with a normalization of ALT levels and finally clearance of the HCV infection. Our data suggest that improved immune functions due to reductions of the HIV load led to a better control and finally resolution of the HCV infection in this patient.

In 1990, he underwent radiation, chemotherapy, and ultimately, a unilateral nephrectomy for Wilms' tumor. Because of previous reports of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-induced nephrotoxicity, our objective was to evaluate and monitor our patient's renal function over the course of 19 months based on serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance using the Cockroft-Gault equation, estimated glomerular filtration rate using the modification of diet in renal disease formula and urinalyses. After experiencing gastrointestinal side effects from other antiretroviral agents, our patient was switched to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in June 2013. At baseline, his serum creatinine was 1.35 mg/dL, estimated creatinine clearance 68.7 mL/min (based on actual body weight of 71.8 kg), estimated glomerular filtration rate 72.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2), with a CD4 cell count of 119 cells/mm(3) (5%) and an undetectable HIV viral load. In March 2015, his weight was 73.2 kg, serum creatinine 1.42 mg/dL, estimated creatinine clearance 65.2 mL/min, estimated glomerular filtration rate 68.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2), with a CD4 cell count of 120 cells/mm(3) (10%) and an undetectable HIV viral load. Other authors have reported tenofovir-induced nephrotoxicity in patients with a solitary kidney. Our patient had no evidence of nephrotoxicity over the course of 19 months on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based antiretroviral therapy (ART). He maintained adequate renal function, comparable to his baseline renal function. Our case report suggests that a tenofovir disoproxil fumurate-based ART may be a viable option for some patients with a solitary kidney. Additional studies and data are needed considering this is a small and relatively unstudied population.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockage therapy is effective for the treatment of many autoimmune inflammatory diseases. However, the role of TNF-α blockage therapy in the innate and adaptive immune responses against HBV is still not clear. A detailed analysis of HBV infection under TNF-α blockage therapy is essential for the prophylaxis and therapy for HBV reactivation and recurrence. In this study, HBV clearance and T-cell responses were analyzed in a HBV-transfected mouse model under anti-TNF blockage therapy. Our results demonstrated that under TNF-α blockage therapy, HBV viral clearance was impaired with persistent elevated HBV viral load in a dose- and temporal-dependent manner. The impairment of HBV clearance under anti-TNF-α blockage therapy occurred at early time points after HBV infection. In addition, TNF-α blockade maintained a higher serum HBV viral load and increased the number of intrahepatic programmed cell death (PD)-1(high)CD127(low) exhausted T cells. Furthermore, TNF-α blockade abolished Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand-induced facilitation of HBV viral clearance. Taken together, TNF-α blockade impairs HBV clearance and enhances viral load, and these effects depend on early administration after HBV infection. Our results here demonstrate that early TNF-α blockade reduces viral clearance and persistently maintains elevated HBV viral load in a mouse model, suggesting that HBV may reactivate during therapy with TNF-α-blocking agents.

We monitored the coreceptor tropism of circulating virus, screened at baseline for coreceptor tropism, in 64 HIV-1-infected patients who received maraviroc (MVC, UK-427,857) as monotherapy for 10 days. Sixty-two patients harbored CCR5-tropic virus at baseline and had a posttreatment phenotype result. Circulating virus remained CCR5 tropic in 60/62 patients, 51 of whom experienced an HIV RNA reduction from baseline of >1 log(10) copies/ml, indicating that CXCR4-using variants were not rapidly selected despite CCR5-specific drug pressure. In two patients, viral load declined during treatment and CXCR4-using virus was detected at day 11. No pretreatment factor predicted the emergence of CXCR4-tropic virus during maraviroc therapy in these two patients. Phylogenetic analysis of envelope (Env) clones from pre- and posttreatment time points indicated that the CXCR4-using variants probably emerged by outgrowth of a pretreatment CXCR4-using reservoir, rather than via coreceptor switch of a CCR5-tropic clone under selection pressure from maraviroc. Phylogenetic analysis was also performed on Env clones from a third patient harboring CXCR4-using virus prior to treatment. This patient was enrolled due to a sample labeling error. Although this patient experienced no overall reduction in viral load in response to treatment, the CCR5-tropic components of the circulating virus did appear to be suppressed while receiving maraviroc as monotherapy. Importantly, in all three patients, circulating virus reverted to predominantly CCR5 tropic following cessation of maraviroc.

Antiretroviral-experienced patients added tenofovir DF 300 mg once daily to their existing regimen. The patterns of HIV-1 resistance development and the corresponding virologic responses were evaluated in a virology substudy at week 48. Although 94% of these treatment-experienced patients had nucleoside-associated resistance mutations (NAMs) at baseline, addition of tenofovir DF resulted in a mean reduction in viral load of -0.59 log10 copies/mL after 24 weeks that was durable through 48 weeks. Relative to the placebo-controlled arm, patients in the tenofovir DF arm had a reduced frequency of development of resistance mutations to all classes of HIV-1 inhibitors, with reduction in new protease inhibitor (PI)-associated mutations achieving statistical significance. The K65R mutation, which occurred in 8 patients (3%), was the only emergent mutation directly associated with tenofovir DF therapy. New thymidine analogue-associated mutations (TAMs) emerged in 19% of patients by week 48. Other than K65R, the patterns of mutations that developed were not significantly different between the tenofovir DF and placebo control arms, suggesting that the background therapies caused their development. The K65R mutation emerged only in patients with no detectable TAMs at baseline, whereas new TAMs developed similarly between patients with or without TAMs at baseline. Development of K65R was associated with mostly low-level changes in phenotypic susceptibility to tenofovir DF and other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and was not associated with viral load rebound. No novel patterns of genotypic or phenotypic resistance to tenofovir were identified. Therefore, intensification with once-daily tenofovir DF therapy resulted in a sustained reduction in HIV-1 viral load and a low risk for development of the K65R mutation in this treatment-experienced patient population.

Providers have experienced many barriers to following screening and treatment recommendations. In 2013, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene partnered with six FQHCs, representing 14 clinics, to make screening for HIV and HCV routine and increase adherence to gonorrhea treatment guidelines through education, electronic health record modification, and progress tracking. After one year, 12 of 14 clinics documented improvement in their HIV offer rate, and 11 clinics documented improvement in their HIV screening rate. Patients who were offered HIV screening increased from 26% at baseline to 56% at follow-up, and patients screened for HIV increased from 25% at baseline to 38% at follow-up. Most clinics improved their HIV screening rate, and progress suggests that local health departments can help FQHCs increase their HIV screening rates.

The purpose of this study was to examine perceptions of race-based and socioeconomic status (SES)-based discrimination during interactions with HIV treatment providers. We recruited 110 individuals (17% female, 51% white) living with HIV from an AIDS service organization in a midwestern city. Results indicated that the majority of participants had perceived discrimination in their interactions with providers when getting treatment for HIV. More specifically, 71% reported having experienced discrimination when receiving treatment for HIV based on their race or color, and 66% reported discrimination attributed to their socioeconomic status, position, or social class. However, participants indicated that they experienced discrimination infrequently. No significant racial/ethnic differences in reports of discrimination were observed. In addition, greater race-based and SES-based discrimination were each associated with greater levels of depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms, greater severity of AIDS-related symptoms, lower perceived general health, and less health care satisfaction. Greater SES-based discrimination was also related to lower adherence to antiretroviral medications. Our findings suggest that experiences with discrimination when getting treatment have important implications for the health and health care of HIV-positive individuals. It is important to note, however, that discrimination based on HIV status or sexual orientation was not assessed and may have affected the results. Studies that explore perceptions of discrimination based on other factors among HIV-positive individuals may improve understanding of the nature, extent, and consequences of discrimination in patient-provider interactions.

HIV protease inhibitor therapy promotes clinical, immunologic and virologic improvement in HIV-infected patients. In this study, we sought to determine the specific effect of HIV protease inhibitors on patient weight. Ten consecutive HIV patients were treated with protease inhibitor-containing regimens over six months. CD4 T-cell counts, plasma viral load levels and bariatric changes were monitored during the study. Patients experienced a mean weight gain of 19 Pounds (P = 0.006). There was a significant increase in mean CD4 T-cell count (P = 0.008) and a significant decrease in mean viral load level (P = 0.004). The increase in CD4 T cells did not correlate with weight gain, whereas the decrease in viral load did show a significant correlation with the weight increase (P = 0.003). The mechanism of protease inhibitor-induced weight gain is discussed. The medications may also be useful for wasting diseases unrelated to HIV.

Using human T cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes as the in vitro target, we have previously shown that antitat is an effective long-term suppressor of HIV-1, including 'field' isolates. To assess the efficacy of this inhibitory gene better in the setting of an infected individual with late-stage AIDS, we examined its antiviral activity in an in vivo established infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from AIDS patients were transduced with replication defective retroviral vectors carrying the antitat gene. In the absence of cell selection, the antitat gene blocked virus replication and allowed infected CD4+ T cells to expand in culture. These results suggest that antitat gene therapy may be beneficial to block HIV-1 replication and reconstitute the immune system of late-phase AIDS patients. We introduced a new parameter, CRF, which defines the effectiveness of the ex vivo gene therapy treatment of AIDS patients. Antitat treatment was efficient in cells of all patients regardless of viral quasispecies, however, it was most potent in severely immunocompromised individuals.

In a randomized, 180-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed with HIV-infected patients classified as A2 and A3 according to the criteria of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, we investigated the effects of oral administration of NAC on HIV-infected patients undergoing their first anti-retroviral therapy; viral load, CD4+ lymphocyte, lymphocyte viability and apoptosis, and TNF-alpha and IL-8 levels were determined. Sixteen patients who received anti-retroviral therapy plus a placebo formed the control group and the study group consisted of 14 patients who received anti-retroviral therapy and NAC supplementation. A significant decrease was seen in viral load, TNF-alpha and IL-8 levels, and lymphocyte apoptosis, and a significant increase was found in levels of CD4+ lymphocytes and lymphocyte viability in both groups after anti-retroviral treatment, but no measurable benefits of anti-retroviral therapy plus NAC oral supplementation (600 mg/day) were found in relation to anti-retroviral therapy alone, and the baseline levels of cysteine and glutathione in plasma were not recovered by this treatment. In conclusion, the daily doses of NAC necessary for the total recuperation of plasma cysteine and glutathione levels in HIV-infected patients and the additional benefits following the supplementation of NAC in patients submitted to anti-retroviral therapy, need to be studied further.

The envelope gene has been shown to accumulate substitutions at a rate of approximately 1% per year and can frequently spend a long time in the host (approximately 10 years). The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) in HIV-1 is known to be different from that of the human host. However, by reengineering the protein coding sequences of HIV-1 to reflect the RSCU patterns observed in humans, a large increase in protein expression is observed. It is reasonable to suggest that within a host there may be a selective drive for change in the RSCU of HIV-1 towards human RSCU. To test this hypothesis we analyzed HIV-1 partial envelope sequences from eight patients sampled serially in time. For each sequence, an RSCU table was constructed. Sequences were labelled as "early" or "late" depending on whether they were sampled before or after the mid-point of the study. Using the RSCU values as descriptor variables, a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was performed. The first three components clearly discriminated between early and late sequences. We also constructed pooled groupwise RSCU tables for early and late sequences. The viral RSCU values of each of the groups were correlated with human RSCU. If there is selection for host-adaptation in RSCU, we expect that "late" viral RSCUs would tend to be more highly correlated with human RSCU than "early" viral RSCUs. In fact, tests of significance suggest that this is the case. However, closer examination of the data revealed that the apparent trend towards human RSCU can be attributed to the homogenization of the codon usage by mutation pressure rather than host adaptation.

AIDS in Europe Study Group., Abstract: The epidemiology of HIV associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was investigated in 6550 European patients with AIDS. NHL was diagnosed in 3.5% of all patients at the time of the AIDS diagnosis. Although the probability of being diagnosed with NHL at AIDS diagnosis was significantly higher among intravenous drug users than among homosexual men, and was associated with increasing age, the observed incidences of NHL were more strikingly similar than any differences. The rate of developing NHL after a previous AIDS diagnosis was 2.4 per 100 patient years of follow-up, and remained constant during a 5-year follow-up period. While primary brain lymphomas comprised only 9% of NHL diagnosed at the time of AIDS, they comprised 38% of NHL diagnosed after AIDS (p < 0.001). The prognosis for patients with NHL at AIDS diagnosis was poor with a median survival of 5 months. A diagnosis of primary brain lymphoma was uniformly associated with a poor outcome. It is concluded that the probability of developing NHL in late stage HIV infection is lower than previously anticipated from the results of small studies on patients receiving long-term anti-retroviral therapy.

However, the successful application of HAART (highly active anti-retroviral therapy) drug regimens has greatly prolonged the life expectancy of HIV-positive patients. Therefore, it has become appropriate to consider this patient population for transplantation. HIV positive transplants are being performed around the country in controlled settings, usually as part of a research protocol. The aim of our study is to describe the Louisiana experience with organ transplantation into HIV-positive patients. We identified seven HIV-positive patients who underwent kidney or kidney/pancreas transplantation at our center between 2007 and 2010. We performed a retrospective chart review to ascertain graft function, as well as virologic and immunologic status post-transplant. Renal function (glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine concentrations) improved in all subjects post-transplant, and six of seven (85.8%) subjects remained virologically suppressed with no progression to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Overall, two-year graft and patient survival rates were 85.5%. HIV seropositive End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients represent a new population of patients that can be successfully transplanted. This offers a new dimension in care for successful HAART therapy to prolong the life of HIV-infected patients.

Treatment of adults infected with hepatitis C with combination therapy consisting of ribavirin and interferon has shown sustained response rates of 30-60%. Little data is available on the response of children infected with hepatitis C treated with combination therapy, especially those with bleeding disorders. We wish to report a single paediatric haemophilia treatment center's results of treatment of adolescents with haemophilia and hepatitis C infection with combination therapy. All patients followed at the haemophilia treatment center with hepatitis C, who were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and had a measurable hepatitis C viral load were eligible. Study patients received at least 6 months of 3 MU interferon-alpha via subcutaneous injection three times per week and 1000 mg day(-1) of ribavirin. Eleven patients agreed to participate in the study. Three patients had an un measurable viral load after 6 months of combination therapy. All three completed 12 months of medication and continued to remain free of hepatitis C for 12 months after discontinuation of therapy. Side-effects of combination therapy were significant but tolerable. The sustained response rate in this study is similar to the historical response rate seen in adults but less than the other reported response rates seen in children treated with combination therapy. Given the toxicity of combination therapy, and natural history of hepatitis C infection in children, consideration of a liver biopsy to evaluate disease progression prior to considering antiviral medications is warranted.

The positive rate of HBsAg was 68.8 to 76.0% per year in patients with HCC, while that of anti-HCV was 3.2 to 9.8% per year. No sex predominance was found in the positive rates of HBsAg and anti-HCV. HBsAg positivity was distributed mostly in the 41 to 50 age group, whereas anti-HCV positivity was distributed mostly in the over 50 age group. Higher positive rate of anti-HCV was observed in HCC patients with serum ALT levels above the normal range than in those with serum ALT levels within the normal range. However, elevated serum ALT levels above the normal range was not related to the positive rate of HBsAg. The relatively low prevalence of anti-HCV in patients with HCC suggests that the role of HCV infection in the development of HCC lower than that of HBV infection in Korea. However, our results suggest that HCV is another potent risk factor for HCC even in HBV endemic areas.

Mortality and cause of death were analyzed in three treatment periods; pre-HAART (1990-1997), early-HAART (1998-2001), and late-HAART period (2002-2011). The patients were retrospectively classified according to the treatment period in which they were recruited. Although mortality rate per 100 person-year declined from 8.7 in pre-HAART to 4.9 in late-HAART period, the proportion of deaths within 3 months of initial visit to study hospital significantly increased from 15.9% in pre-HAART to 55.1% in late-HAART period (P < 0.001). Overall, 59% of deaths were attributable to AIDS-related conditions, and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) was the most common cause of death (20.3%). The proportion of PCP as cause of death significantly increased from 8.7% in pre-HAART to 31.8% in late-HAART period (P < 0.001). Despite of significant improvement of survival, there was still a high risk of early death in patients presenting in HAART era, mainly due to late human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis and late presentation to care.

As of 30 June 2005, 259 (24.8%) persons had died after a median observation duration of 985 days (range, 2 - 4,025 days). The mortality rate declined from 33.75 per 100 person-years in the pre-HAART era to 6.51 per 100 person-years in the late-HAART era (P < 0.0001). The adjusted hazard ratios for death in persons with a baseline CD4 count of <200 cells/mul in periods 2 and 3 were 0.605 (P = 0.007) and 0.371 (P < 0.0001), respectively, when compared with persons enrolled in period 1; the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 0.611 for persons enrolled in period 3 when compared to period 2 (P = 0.01). Our study suggested that the survival of persons in the late stage of HIV infection in Taiwan continued to improve in the late HAART era.

To assess rate and predictors of attrition (no retention in care) and HAART effectiveness in HIV-1 infected patients who pay for medication and laboratory testing in Mozambique, we conducted a multicenter survey of HIV-1-infected patients who started HAART during 2002-2006. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess risk of attrition and of therapy failure. Overall, 142 patients from 16 healthcare centers located in the capital city Maputo were followed-up for 22.2 months (12.1-46.7). The retention rate was 75%, 48% and 37% after one, two and three years, respectively. Risk of attrition was lower in patients with higher baseline CD4 count (P = 0.022) and attending healthcare center 1 (HCC1) (P = 0.013). The proportion of individuals with CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/µL was 55% (78/142) at baseline and decreased to 6% (3/52) at 36 months. Among the patients with available VL, 86% (64/74) achieved undetectable VL levels. The rate of immunologic failure was 17.2% (95% CI: 12.6-22.9) per 100 person-years. Risk of failure was associated to higher baseline CD4 count (P = 0.002), likely reflecting low adherence levels, and decreased with baseline VL ≥ 10,000 copies/mL (P = 0.033). These results suggest that HAART can be effective in HIV-1 infected patients from Mozambique that pay for their medication and laboratory testing. Further studies are required to identify the causes for low retention rates in patients with low CD4 counts and to better understand the association between healthcare setting and attrition rate.

One hundred eight patients underwent a total of 169 graft procedures; mean follow-up was 14 1/2 months. There were 18 (17%) patients who were HIV-positive who had no symptoms, 11 (10%) patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and 79 (73%) patients who were HIV-negative. Twenty-three percent (25/108) of patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA), most of whom also had either AIDS or asymptomatic HIV infection. Dialysis procedures included 44 autogenous reconstructions (26%), 117 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts (69%), and 8 (5%) procedures of unknown type. Arteriovenous fistula or graft thrombosis was a frequent complication. The overall 12-month graft patency rate was 41%, and patients with HIV infection or a history of IVDA did not have a significantly increased risk of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that the use of PTFE as opposed to autogenous reconstruction was the only significant risk factor found for occlusion within the first 12 months after operation (p < 0.01). Twenty-five graft infections occurred, all in PTFE grafts. The PTFE graft infection rate was 43% in patients with AIDS, 36% in patients who were HIV-positive and who had no symptoms, and 15% in patients who were HIV-negative (p < 0.05). Patients with a history of IVDA had a 41% PTFE graft infection rate versus a 13% infection rate in patients who did not have a history of IVDA (p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

To understand adherence experiences among HIV-infected drug users, we conducted semistructured interviews with 15 participants in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of directly observed HAART delivered in methadone maintenance clinics. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. We identified negative and positive psychological themes associated with both drug use and adherence. Participants described tension between negative feelings (denial, shame, and perceived isolation) and positive feelings (acceptance, motivation, empowerment, and perceived connectedness), and they associated this tension with their own drug using and adherence behaviors. Sustained antiretroviral therapy adherence may require increased emphasis on understanding the psychological experience of HIV-infected drug users.

We used multiple data sources (role-play, focus group discussions (FGD), and in-depth interviews (IDI)) to better understand adherence barriers for Rwandan adolescents. Forty-two HIV positive adolescents (ages 12-21) and a selection of their primary caregivers were interviewed. All were perinatally-infected and received (cART) for ≥ 12 months. Topics discussed during FGDs and IDIs included learning HIV status, disclosure and stigma, care and treatment issues, cART adherence barriers.

This article evaluates the current state of the science in adherence to antiretroviral therapy for persons with HIV. The primary objectives are to 1) identify critical determinants of adherence, and 2) describe interventions to improve adherence. Adherence is a complex dynamic behavior influenced by characteristics of the patient, treatment regimen, disease, patient-provider relationship, and clinical setting. Therefore, the most promising interventions are multifaceted and target different locations in this matrix simultaneously. Unfortunately, nonadherence remains a formidable barrier in the management of HIV, resulting in the development of resistance and drug failure. Moreover, adherence is a public health concern, with implications for the transmission of HIV in general and the transmission of drug-resistant strains of HIV specifically. Despite substantial attention to adherence in recent years, much more remains to be done to better understand and promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy through effective interventions. From this integration of biomedical and behavioral science, effective clinical interventions can be developed and implemented to enhance the health of patients with HIV.

However, evidence is lacking on the causal effect of adherence on the outcomes. The goal of this study is to understand whether near perfect adherence is necessary to achieve optimal virologic outcome and also to investigate the effect of initial adherence to antiretroviral therapies on initial viral suppression by different regimens. A cohort study was conducted on HIV veterans initiating antiretroviral therapies in 1999 to 2015. The primary outcome was the first viral suppression occurred within 30 to 60 days since the index date. Multiple imputation was used to impute the missing value of virologic outcomes. The inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method was applied to estimate the viral suppression rate at each specific adherence category for each regimen category. Marginal structural models with IPTW were used to estimate the risk of viral suppression in lower-adherence categories in comparison to near-perfect adherence level ≥95%. Data showed that lower adherence caused lower viral suppression rate, with the association differentiated by the regimen. Patients on integrase strand transfer had the highest viral suppression rate, with patients on protease inhibitors having the lowest rate. Regardless of regimens, the viral suppression rate among patients at initial adherence of 75 to <95% was not statistically different from patients at adherence of ≥95%; however, the differences might be clinically significant.

The evidence suggests that poor adherence to antiretroviral drug therapy is a major problem that has the potential to diminish effective viral suppression, promote viral resistance, and place patients at risk for hospitalization, opportunistic infections, and an increased risk of HIV transmission. The primary aim of this study was to understand patients' experiences regarding their adherence to antiretroviral drug therapy. Thus, 19 participants were recruited for in-depth interviews regarding their adherence to drug regimens. All the interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by using Benner's phenomenological analysis approach. Four main themes emerged from the data: (i) choosing to live and the decision to start taking medications; (ii) strategies for adhering to the regimen and managing the side-effects; (iii) relationships with healthcare providers; and (iv) advantages of the medications as a motivator to continue one's adherence to the regimen. Studying and understanding the experiences of patients can provide new insights and strategies in order to enhance patients' adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy.

To better understand barriers to antiretroviral treatment adherence, we conducted a qualitative research study, using both focus group and key informant methods, among 36 HIV-positive men and women in Dali, in southwestern China. All interviews utilized semi-structured question guides and were conducted in Mandarin, audio-recorded and translated into English for analysis. The most commonly cited adherence challenges were stigma, including secondary stigma experienced by family members; mental health issues; and economic concerns, particularly related to finding and maintaining employment. Distinctive gender differences emerged, partly due to previous heroin use among male respondents. Optimizing adherence may require that antiretroviral therapy programs be linked to other services, including drug addiction treatment, mental health services and vocational treatment and support. HIV care and service providers and policy makers in China responsible for HIV treatment should be aware of these important barriers to adherence.

Low adherence to smoking cessation pharmacotherapy may limit treatment effectiveness. In this study, 158 participants recruited from three HIV care centers in New York City were randomized to receive 12-weeks of varenicline (Chantix) either alone as standard care (SC) or in combination with text message (TM) support or TM plus cell phone-delivered adherence-focused motivational and behavioral therapy (ABT). Generalized linear mixed-effect models found a significant decline in varenicline adherence from week 1-12 across treatment groups. At 12-weeks, the probability of smoking abstinence was significantly higher in SC+TM+ABT than in SC. The study demonstrates the feasibility of delivering adherence-focused interventions to PLHIV who smoke. Findings suggest intensive behavioral support is an important component of an effective smoking cessation intervention for this population, and a focus on improving adherence self-efficacy may lead to more consistent adherence and higher smoking abstinence.

Patterns of adherence with these drug regimens in adolescents remains unknown. Identifying nonadherence in HIV-infected patients to antiviral regimens and developing corrective measures could improve patient outcomes. This study was undertaken to understand adherence in HIV-infected youths engaged in care and to reduce patterns of nonadherence. A retrospective analysis of 25 charts (78%) of HIV-infected youths (n = 32, age 13 to 21 years) were consecutively reviewed from January 1993 to May 1998. Charts were reviewed for documentation of factors previously documented to be associated with adherence: housing stability, social support, prior sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and/or pregnancy, HIV exposure category, number of clinic visits, number of pills per day, number of medications per day, knowledge of medication schedule, age, gender, race/ethnicity, health status as revealed by CD4 count and viral load, and recorded patterns of adherence to medications and clinic appointments. Thirteen of the 18 (72%) patients who were receiving antiretroviral medication were nonadherent. Sixty-seven percent of the females and 80% of the males reported missing doses. Housing instability (p = 0.031) and/or length of treatment with antiviral medications (months of treatment) (p = 0.043) were significantly correlated with nonadherence. The stability of the adolescents' living situations was the most significant correlate of medication adherence for this population of HIV-infected youth.

We have investigated the role of adherence as an activator of HIV-1 transcription and release. The effects of adherence on HIV-1 transcription were examined by using THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line, transfected with HIV long terminal repeat (LTR)-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) constructs. The effects of adherence on release of HIV-1 were investigated in both HIV-1-infected THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Adherence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated THP-1 cells to either tissue culture plastic or endothelial cells was crucial for enhanced HIV-1 transcription as measured by LTR-CAT expression. Such increased LTR-CAT expression did not occur with an HIV LTR construct containing mutated NF-kappa B binding sites. In contrast, release of whole HIV, measured by reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in tissue culture medium, was reduced upon adherence of stimulated HIV-1-infected THP-1 cells without suppression of HIV LTR-CAT transcription or p24 release. This finding suggested that activation of adherent monocytic cells interfered with HIV assembly and release. Although the reduction of RT activity following activation of HIV-1-infected MDM was independent of adhesion, adherence alone of nonstimulated HIV-infected MDM to endothelial cells was sufficient to induce a reduction in RT release. This study demonstrates that LPS stimulation of monocytic cells enhances HIV LTR transcription under adherent conditions. In contrast, activation of adherent monocytic cells infected with HIV reduced viral release.

The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of serological markers of syphilis, HIV-1/2, HTLV-I/II, HBV, and HCV infections among immigrant sex workers in Madrid, Spain and to characterize the HIV-1 variants in seropositive individuals. Sera from 762 immigrant commercial sex workers (75.3% from sub-Saharan Africa, 18.2% from South America, and 6.4% from Eastern Europe) were collected between 1998 and 2003 in Madrid and examined. Antibody detection was performed by screening assays (RPR, ELISAs) and confirmed by FTA-Abs, LIAs and Western-blot tests. HIV-1 subtyping was carried out by phylogenetic analyses of the protease and envelope genes. Antibodies to HIV-1 were found in 5.2%, while 3.5% tested positive for HBsAg, 3% for syphilis antibodies, 0.8% for HCV antibodies, and 0.2% for HTLV-I antibodies. None were reactive for HIV-2 or HTLV-II antibodies. HIV-1 seroprevalence among Africans and Ecuadorians was 4.5 and 10.9%, respectively. All HIV-1 seropositive Ecuadorians were transsexual men, and 28.6% had active syphilis infection. Up to 80% of HIV-1 positive specimens were characterized as non-B subtypes, with subtypes G, A, and G/A recombinants being the most frequent among African individuals. In contrast, South Americans with HIV-1 infection carried exclusively subtype B variants. A relatively high proportion of immigrant sex workers in Madrid were infected with HIV-1 and syphilis, whereas infections with hepatitis viruses or HTLV were uncommon.

This study was developed to compare sexual behaviors and STD prevalence between older HIV-infected individuals and their younger counterparts. We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study of HIV-infected individuals > or =18 years who completed an annual behavioral assessment. A total of 541 individuals completed the assessment. Analyses were performed to examine differences in sexual behaviors and STD prevalence between age groups: younger (18-35 years) (30%), middle-aged (36-49 years) (46%), and older (> or =50 years) (24%). Older individuals were most likely to be male and Caucasian with longest time since HIV diagnosis, greatest receipt of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and highest rates of HIV RNA <50 copies/mL (all p<0.001). Reports of recent sexual activity decreased with age, younger (56%) vs. middle-aged (43%) vs. older (27%) (p<0.001). The median number of recent sex partners was one (range 1-25) and 68% overall reported using condoms consistently; these parameters did not differ by age group. STD prevalence was 8% (gonorrhea [9], chlamydia [7], and syphilis [20]) and was highest among younger individuals (younger [11%] vs. middle-aged [7%] vs. older [3%]). Our results demonstrated that with older age, sexual activity declines but inconsistent condom use remains commonly reported. Furthermore, STDs were identified among all age groups. This latter finding reinforces the need for secondary prevention efforts among all individuals living with HIV/AIDS.

To identify factors associated with delayed presentation to medical care after testing HIV-positive or with late HIV testing, we studied 968 patients at their first HIV care visit, enrolled in a multicenter study in Italy from 1997-2000. Patients completed a questionnaire on HIV-testing history, sexual behavior, and drug use behavior. Delayed presenters were patients with >6 months between their first HIV-positive test and presentation for HIV care; late testers were patients with CD4 count < 200 /mm or clinically defined AIDS at their first HIV-positive test. Among the study patients, 255 (26.3%) were delayed presenters, and 280 (28.9%) were late testers. In multinomial logistic regression analysis, injection drug use significantly increased (odds ratio [OR]= 5.04) the probability of delayed presentation but reduced (OR = 0.55) the chance of late testing. A previous HIV-negative test was associated with a reduced risk of both delayed presentation (OR = 0.39) and late testing (OR = 0.36). Unemployment was positively associated with delayed presentation and increasing age with late testing, whereas HIV counseling at the time of first positive HIV test strongly (OR = 0.42) reduced the odds of delayed presentation. Interventions aimed at promoting timely access to care of HIV-infected persons should consider differentiated programs for delayed presentation and late testing.

Of the 71 (24%) individuals with HIV infection, 67 (94%) were HIV antibody-positive, and 4 (6%) were HIV antibody-negative but p24 antigen-positive at the time of presentation. HIV-1 DNA was detected in 24 (34%) specimens. The genital ulcers of all four acutely infected p24-antigenemic subjects were HIV-1 DNA-positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, compared with 20 of 67 (30%) seropositive patients (p = .01). Presence of chancroid, GUD symptoms for > 10 days, and concurrent diagnosis of cervicitis or urethritis were significantly associated risk factors for HIV-1 DNA shedding in ulcers. Early GUD diagnosis and aggressive treatment of HIV-infected patients may significantly reduce secondary transmission of HIV to other sex partners.

A persistent liquoral neutrophilia and low adenosindeaminase values were observed in cerebrospinal fluid of purulent appearance. The patient responded badly to tuberculostatic treatment and died. In the antibiogram carried out resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis was observed to rifampicine and isoniazide, two of the five drugs the patient had received. The peculiarities of the clinical form of presentation similar to purulent bacterian meningitis are discussed, and the possible influence of HIV infection and the antibiotic multiresistance observed in the bad evolution of the tuberculous meningitis which the patient developed.

However, visceral leishmaniasis has not, until now, been included in the AIDS case definition. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical features and determinants for relapse and case-fatality of visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-infected patients from a Spanish Mediterranean area. A chart review was conducted in 16 hospitals in the autonomous communities of Valencia and Murcia (Spain). From 1988 to 2001, a total of 228 episodes of visceral leishmaniasis were diagnosed in 155 HIV-infected patients by the detection of amastigotes in bone marrow aspirates or in other tissue samples. Most patients had advanced HIV disease, with a median CD4(+) lymphocyte cell count of 55 cells x 10(9) l, and 56% of them had a previous AIDS-indicator disease. The median duration of follow-up was 8.4 months. HIV-infected patients with visceral leishmaniasis presented with fever (76%), hepatomegaly (77%), splenomegaly (78%), and varying degrees of cytopenias. Leishmania was detected in atypical sites in 22 (14%) patients. A total of 37 (24%) patients had a relapse of visceral leishmaniasis. Female gender was a risk factor for relapse, whereas administration of secondary prophylaxis for visceral leishmaniasis and a completed therapy for visceral leishmaniasis were protective factors against relapse. A total of 86 (54%) patients died. Independent determinants for survival were CD4(+) lymphocyte cell count, completed therapy for leishmania, and secondary prophylaxis for visceral leishmaniasis. The findings show that, in HIV-infected patients, visceral leishmaniasis occurs in late stages of HIV disease and often has a relapsing course. Secondary prophylaxis reduces the risk of relapse. Visceral leishmaniasis in the HIV-infected population should be included in the CDC clinical category C for the definition of AIDS in the same way that other geographically specific opportunistic infections are included.

All completed the dose-escalation phase of weekly dosing at 100-mg increments and received at least one maintenance dose, 100 mg below the patient's toxic dose, for 12 weeks. Dose-limiting toxicity occurred in 3 patients at 200-mg, 5 at 300-mg, and 3 at 400-mg dose levels. One tolerated the 500-mg dose without dose-limiting toxicity. Dose-limiting toxicities included fatigue, fever, malaise, increased transaminases, hypotension, vomiting, and depression. Seven of 12 completed 12 weeks of maintenance. At > or = 200 mg of imiquimod, all patients had biologic responses, measured by elevations in serum interferon, beta2-microglobulin, and neopterin levels. Imiquimod induced pronounced levels of circulating interferon in asymptomatic HIV-infected persons, with variable effect on virus load.

Relatively little is known about how women with HIV perceive secondary transmission risk in the context of HIV treatment advances. This study describes sexual risk perceptions and behaviors of 80 women enrolled in HIV outpatient care in 1999. Participants completed structured interviews assessing sexual risk perceptions, attitudes regarding severity of HIV disease, sources of HIV prevention information, and sexual practices during the previous 6 months. Medical histories including 6-month cumulative incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were obtained from a clinic database. Thirty-five percent of the sample had engaged in unprotected intercourse or had been diagnosed with an STD in the past 6 months. Only 5% of women believed that medication-related reductions in viral load signify safer sex is unimportant, but 15% indicated they practice safer sex less often since the advent of new HIV treatments and 40% believed AIDS is now a less serious threat. These data suggest women's perceptions of diminished disease severity may be more influential than beliefs regarding diminished infectivity. Study results have implications for framing prevention messages for women and suggest that close integration of secondary prevention and clinical HIV services may be beneficial.

The overall incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease was 11.3 cases per 100,000 person-years in adult patients without known HIV infection and 677 cases per 100,000 person-years in HIV-infected patients. This incidence remained stable over the study period. Clinical presentation, severity of illness, and number of recurrent episodes were similar in patients with CD4+ cell counts of >200 or < or =200 cells/ microL. Patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) were more likely to present with TMP-SMZ-resistant pneumococci than were those who were not receiving this agent (76.7% vs. 43.6%; P=.007). The mortality rate was high (21%).

The effect of HIV on presentation, treatment, and outcomes of NHL and HL in routine care in the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) merits further characterization. We performed a retrospective analysis of HIV-infected patients with NHL and HL receiving care at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from January 1, 2000 until December 31, 2010. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc). Sixty-five HIV-infected patients with NHL and HL were identified. Patients with non-CNS NHL and HL presented with advanced disease (85% stage III or IV) and adverse prognostic features. Patients completed 87% of planned chemotherapy cycles, and 68% of patients completed stage-appropriate therapy. Dose reduction, interruption, and/or delay occurred during more than 25% of administered cycles in 64% of patients. Infectious complications, febrile neutropenia, and myelosuppression accounted for 78% of deviations from planned cumulative dose and dose intensity. Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) was associated with poor prognosis, but 2-year overall survival was 66% for all non-CNS lymphoma. Among patients surviving at least 2 years, 75% had CD4 count >200 cells/μl and 79% had HIV viral load <400 copies/ml at last follow-up. Despite advanced disease and difficulty tolerating chemotherapy with optimal cumulative dose and dose intensity, most patients with non-CNS HIV-associated lymphoma survived more than 2 years after diagnosis, the majority with suppressed HIV RNA.

Variations in both SNPs were determined by the TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. In the 286 patients chronically infected by HCV genotypes 1 or 4, both rs14158 CC and rs12979860 CC were associated with a higher rate of sustained virological response (SVR), and these effects were complementary in both HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Thus, 24 % of patients with rs14158/rs12979860 TT-TC/TT-TC, 33 % with TT-TC/CC, 44.2 % with CC/TT-TC, and 75.8 % harboring CC/CC attained SVR (p < 0.001). SC was associated with the IL28B genotype (66.7 % CC in SC vs. 42.6 % among those with chronic infection, p < 0.001) but not with the LDLR genotype. There was no association between GP and the plasma level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or the presence of advanced fibrosis. There is a complementary effect between the IL28B and LDLR genotypes on the probability of achieving SVR after Peg-IFN/RBV therapy in patients with HCV 1 or 4. Thus, the predictive value of IL28B genotype is modulated by the LDLR genotype in both HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. This complementary effect of both genotypes is also observed on the plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

While it is still unclear whether HCV affects the course of HIV infection, there is ample evidence that concurrent HIV infection accelerates the progression of fibrosis and liver-related morbidity and mortality in HCV-infected patients. The treatment of HCV infection in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection has improved during the last few years, but the outcome appears to be poorer than the outcome in HCV monoinfected patients. In this article the epidemiological and clinical aspects of HCV/HIV coinfection are described, and the four major treatment trials are reviewed.

We aimed to study whether T cell apoptosis markers indicate pathways that may contribute to clinical progression in HCV monoinfected and HIV-HCV coinfected patients. Activation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathways was measured by levels of death receptor Fas, initiator caspase 8 and effector caspases 3 and 7 activity and Annexin V binding on peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells of HCV monoinfected and HIV/HCV coinfected patients, as well as healthy controls and HIV-infected, hepatitis B virus-infected and primary biliary cirrhosis disease controls. Association with liver fibrosis was assessed by biopsy or by transient elastography. HCV monoinfected and HIV-HCV coinfected patients displayed enhanced peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cell apoptosis. Caspase 8 activity was highest in HIV-HCV coinfection, without enhanced downstream activity of caspases 3 and 7. Level of peripheral T cell apoptosis was independent of liver fibrosis or other disease parameters in all disease groups. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway is upregulated in HCV monoinfection and HIV-HCV coinfection, but this is independent of liver disease severity.

A prospective cohort of HIV-infected patients starting a ritonavir boosted darunavir monotherapy (mtDRV/rtv) was followed for 24 months. HCV infection was evaluated by HCV viremia and hepatic fibrosis. Immune activation was studied as HLA-DR CD38 coexpression on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and also the quantification of plasma sCD14 levels. Microbial translocation was studied by the plasma levels of 16S rDNA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A total of 150 HIV-infected patients were enrolled in this study, including 46 individuals also infected with HCV (30.6%). HIV/HCV coinfection did not decrease mtDRV/rtv efficacy, since similar rates of HIV-1 intermittent viremia (HCV: 26.6% vs. no-HCV: 34.7%) and episodes of virological failure (HCV: 22.2% vs. no-HCV: 11.2%, p-value = 0.381) were found. No major differences were found between both groups at baseline, although higher HLA-DR(+)CD38(+)CD4(+) T cell counts were found in the coinfected group (HCV: 6.65% vs. no-HCV: 4.55%, p-value = 0.032); this difference was maintained in the 24 months of follow-up. After the 24-month follow-up, both groups, HIV-monoinfected patients and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, presented similar immune activation and microbial translocation profiles. In conclusion, the use of a simplified mtDRV/rtv strategy compromises neither HIV nor HCV viremic control in coinfected patients, although a higher immune activation of CD4(+) T cells was found.

This study seeks to explore the geographic and individual factors associated with starting ART on time. This retrospective study includes 15,734 HIV-positive adults initiating ART at two HIV clinics in Lilongwe, Malawi. The outcome was starting ART within two weeks of meeting ART eligibility as defined by the Malawi ART guidelines. Euclidean distance from patient neighbourhood to their clinic was calculated using Google Earth. Logistic regression models assessed factors influencing starting ART on time. Of 15,734 adults initiating ART, 8178 were from Lighthouse (LH) and 7556 were from Martin Preuss Center (MPC). Combined, 68.7% started treatment on time. Patients who were eligible for ART based on a CD4 cell count <250 cells/mm(3) versus WHO stage were less likely to begin ART on time at both LH (odds ratio [OR] 0.16; 95% CI 0.13-0.19) and MPC (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.21-0.28). Likelihood of starting on time decreased with each kilometer further from clinic location among LH patients (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.94-0.99); distance was not significant at MPC. In conclusion, predictors differed by clinic. Distance to clinic and type of eligibility for ART significantly influence starting ART on time.

The mitochondrial DNA haplogroup H was the most prevalent (50.3%) in this population. The cluster Others and V were recognized as risk factors for the development of liver fibrosis while haplogroup H and HCV genotype 4 confer a lower risk. This information might be useful for prioritization of HCV treatment, especially for F0-F1 patients for whom there is no urgency for treatment.

=> 1th document retrieved: Order: 5685, Title: Treatment of antiretroviral-drug-resistant HIV-1 infection., Abstract: Drug-resistant HIV-1 is a cause of growing clinical and public-health concern. In many patients, combination antiretroviral therapy fails to achieve complete viral suppression (virological failure). Continuing viral replication during therapy leads to the accumulation of drug-resistance mutations, resulting in increased viral load and a greater risk of disease progression. Patients with drug-resistant HIV-1 infection have three therapeutic options: a change to a salvage regimen with the aim of fully suppressing viral replication; interruption of therapy; or continuation of a partially effective regimen. The first strategy is preferred for most patients failing their first or perhaps their second regimen. However, the best approach remains unclear for patients who have failed multiple treatment regimens and who have limited options for complete viral suppression. The management of such patients requires a careful understanding of the pathogenesis of drug-resistant HIV-1, the clinical consequences of virological failure, the potential benefits and limitations of diagnostic assays, and the likelihood that agents in development will be effective.

A 27-year-old Bulgarian woman received a kidney transplant from a cadaveric donor owing to chronic renal failure due to glomerulonephritis of unknown etiology. Five days after the donation, the tissues showed HIV-1 infection, so she was immediately initiated on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with lopinavir/ritonavir, zidovudine, enfuvirtide, and lamivudine. Subsequently, according to the genotypic test which revealed a complex resistance pattern of the HIV-1, we changed the regimen to darunavir/ritonavir, etravirine, lamivudine, and enfuvirtide. The HIV-1 genome (550 UI/mL), which was detected at 5 days after transplantation, rapidly declined to undetectable levels at 3 weeks after HAART. The CD4+ T-cell nadir was 432 cells/microL (40%) to 1,400 cells/microL after 2 years. The posttransplantation course was complicated by cytomegalovirus pneumonia. At 32 months after transplantation, the patient had experienced hypertension with secondary retinopathy, bilateral cataracts, diabetes, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis with multiple vertebral fractures, a hip prosthesis, and a bone infarction of the femur. Major management problems had been related to steroid and HAART treatment side effects. Therapeutic interactions between the immunosuppressants and the antiretroviral drugs were complex for management, requiring frequent checks of drug levels and dose-adjustments. We finally obtained a stable clinical and viroimmunologic condition. The transmission of multiresistant strains of HIV from unknown patients requires complex multidisciplinary management.

Liver functions deteriorated 1 to 2 wk after withdrawal of the steroid therapy and liver failure occurred. Steroid readministration and intensive therapy for liver failure did not prevent death. An excessive immune response provoked by steroid withdrawal and decreased reserve capacity due to underlying chronic liver disease were thought to be factors in the liver failure. Caution must be exercised in the administration of steroids to patients with underlying chronic HBV infection to prevent exacerbation of hepatitis. Prompt readministration of steroids is indicated if evidence of liver failure develops.

In patients who have never experienced virologic failure while receiving ARV therapy and who have no evidence of drug resistance, switching to any of the acceptable US Department of Health and Human Services first-line therapies is expected to maintain virologic suppression. However, in virologically suppressed patients with a history of virologic failure or drug resistance, it can be more challenging to change therapy while still maintaining virologic suppression. In these patients, it may be difficult to know whether the discontinuation of one of the ARVs in a suppressive regimen constitutes the removal of a key regimen component that will not be adequately supplanted by one or more substituted ARVs. In this article, we review many of the clinical scenarios requiring ARV therapy modification in patients with stable virologic suppression and outline the strategies for modifying therapy while maintaining long-term virologic suppression.

Antiretroviral therapy was discontinued in two weeks but renal function, as well as tubular function, did not shown full recovery even at a 3-year follow-up examination. Acute tubular necrosis, a rare but well-known side effect of tenofovir, was suspected, but kidney biopsy confirmed interstitial nephritis. It is important to distinguish drug-induced interstitial nephritis from acute tubular necrosis, because early steroid administration can improve renal dysfunction caused by acute interstitial nephritis.

CD4 lymphocytes were selectively expanded in vitro by T cell receptor triggering, which also induces HIV production from latently infected cells. CD4 cell expansion and lack of virus production in cultures correlated well with clinical responses and were best in those receiving an aggressive antiretroviral three-drug regimen. Twelve clinical responders receiving triple-drug therapy monitored for 60 weeks had both excellent ex vivo CD4 cell expansion and lack of HIV replication, often in the absence of added drug in culture. Breakthrough viruses recovered from drug-containing arms of the cultures showed phenotypic resistance to the drugs used in vivo. This CD4 lymphocyte outgrowth assay correlates well with clinical outcome in subjects receiving potent antiretroviral regimens and may predict the emergence of early drug resistance.

Recommendations of the Panel on Clinical Practices for Treatment of HIV., Abstract: The availability of an increasing number of antiretroviral agents and the rapid evolution of new information has introduced substantial complexity into treatment regimens for persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation convened the Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV to develop guidelines for clinical management of HIV-infected adults and adolescents (CDC. Report of the NIH Panel To Define Principles of Therapy of HIV Infection and Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected adults and adolescents. MMWR 1998;47[RR-5]:1-41). This report, which updates the 1998 guidelines, addresses 1) using testing for plasma HIV ribonucleic acid levels (i.e., viral load) and CD4+ T cell count; 2) using testing for antiretroviral drug resistance; 3) considerations for when to initiate therapy; 4) adherence to antiretroviral therapy; 5) considerations for therapy among patients with advanced disease; 6) therapy-related adverse events; 7) interruption of therapy; 8) considerations for changing therapy and available therapeutic options; 9) treatment for acute HIV infection; 10) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among adolescents; 11) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among pregnant women; and 12) concerns related to transmission of HIV to others. Antiretroviral regimens are complex, have serious side effects, pose difficulty with adherence, and carry serious potential consequences from the development of viral resistance because of nonadherence to the drug regimen or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents. Patient education and involvement in therapeutic decisions is critical. Treatment should usually be offered to all patients with symptoms ascribed to HIV infection. Recommendations for offering antiretroviral therapy among asymptomatic patients require analysis of real and potential risks and benefits. Treatment should be offered to persons who have <350 CD4+ T cells/mm3 or plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels of >55,000 copies/mL (by b-deoxyribonucleic acid [bDNA] or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] assays). The recommendation to treat asymptomatic patients should be based on the willingness and readiness of the person to begin therapy; the degree of existing immunodeficiency as determined by the CD4+ T cell count; the risk for disease progression as determined by the CD4+ T cell count and level of plasma HIV RNA; the potential benefits and risks of initiating therapy in an asymptomatic person; and the likelihood, after counseling and education, of adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. Treatment goals should be maximal and durable suppression of viral load, restoration and preservation of immunologic function, improvement of quality of life, and reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Results of therapy are evaluated through plasma HIV RNA levels, which are expected to indicate a 1.0 log10 decrease at 2-8 weeks and no detectable virus (<50 copies/mL) at 4-6 months after treatment initiation. Failure of therapy at 4-6 months might be ascribed to nonadherence, inadequate potency of drugs or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents, viral resistance, and other factors that are poorly understood. Patients whose therapy fails in spite of a high level of adherence to the regimen should have their regimen changed; this change should be guided by a thorough drug treatment history and the results of drug-resistance testing. Because of limitations in the available alternative antiretroviral regimens that have documented efficacy, optimal changes in therapy might be difficult to achieve for patients in whom the preferred regimen has failed. These decisions are further confounded by problems with adherence, toxicity, and resistance. For certain patients, participating in a clinical trial with or without access to new drugs or using a regimen that might not achieve complete suppression of viral replication might be preferable. Because concepts regarding HIV management are evolving rapidly, readers should check regularly for additional information and updates at the HIV/AIDS Treatment Information Service website (http://www.hivatis.org).

A prospective study with long-term observation of 41 patients., Abstract: Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a rare disease whose frequency has been decreasing over the past 10 years. We evaluated 41 patients with HBV-related PAN to determine the circumstances leading to infection, the clinical features of vasculitis, the prognostic factors, and the response to therapy. Most patients were first treated briefly with corticosteroids, and all were included in 2 nonrandomized prospective therapeutic trials of an antiviral agent (35 patients with vidarabine, 6 patients with interferon-alpha 2b) and plasma exchanges. The mean duration of follow-up was 69.6 +/- 44.8 months. At the end of the study, 21 (51.2%) patients had seroconverted to anti-HBeAb and 10 (24.4%) also had seroconverted to anti-HBsAb. In all, 23 (56%) patients no longer expressed serologic evidence of HBV replication. All 33 (80.5%) patients still alive at the end of follow-up recovered from PAN. Nineteen also recovered from HBV infection and were considered to be cured; 13 patients had persistent HBV infection and were considered to be in clinical recovery; and 1 patient was in remission, maintained with steroid therapy. Eight patients died during the study period; 3 deaths were directly attributable to PAN. HBV-related PAN is an acute disease, occurring shortly after infection and sharing the characteristics of classic PAN. It is not an antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA)-mediated vasculitis. The outcome was good for patients treated with short-term steroid therapy, antiviral agents, and plasma exchanges. We propose this protocol as the first treatment for HBV-related PAN, because it surpasses the conventional treatment with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, which facilitates viral replication and the development of chronic HBV infection.

The NNRTI-containing triple therapy and the 5-drug regimen blocked viral replication to the greatest extent (R(0) = 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.91; and 0.90, 95% CI, 0.82-0.98, respectively), with the former being significantly better than the PI-containing triple regimen (R(0) = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92-1.03; p =.007). Both the NNRTI-containing and the 5-drug regimen, as well as the PI-containing triple therapy, were significantly better at blocking viral replication than the double NRTI therapy (R(0) = 1.04; 95% CI, 1.0-1.07). Measurement of viral load after approximately 7 days provided the most accurate measure of the degree of viral suppression induced by a given drug regimen.

In HIV-infected populations, better self-efficacy for medication management is associated with improved adherence to antiretroviral medications (ARVs), which is critically important for controlling symptoms and slowing disease progression.

Few studies have examined adherence to Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) during pregnancy and in the postpartum period when the demands of childcare may significantly interfere with women's self-care behaviors. This study examined ART use and adherence in HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women participating in the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS-IV) in the US. Adherence was assessed through a self-report interview during the third trimester of pregnancy and six-month postpartum. Data were also collected on demographics, biomedical markers and health related symptoms. During the third trimester visit, 77% (309/399) of women completed the self-report adherence measure; 61% (188/309) reported complete adherence. Factors associated with non-adherence included advanced HIV disease status, higher HIV-RNA viral load, more health-related symptoms and alcohol and tobacco use. At six-month postpartum, 55% (220/399) completed the measure; 44% (97/220) of these women reported complete adherence. Factors associated with non-adherence during the postpartum period were ethnicity, more health-related symptoms and WITS clinical site. Results of multivariate analyses using Generalized Estimated Equation analyses across the two visits revealed that more health-related symptoms, higher HIV-RNA viral load, increased alcohol use and clinical site were independently associated with ART non-adherence. These analyses indicate that medication adherence is more likely during pregnancy than postpartum in HIV-infected women, perhaps provoked by motivation to reduce vertical transmission and/or intensive antepartum surveillance. Further investigation is warranted to clarify factors implicated in women's decision-making process regarding ART medication adherence.

This paper describes the challenges, methods, and baseline sample of the Housing and Health Study, a longitudinal, multi-site, randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of providing immediate rental housing assistance to PLWHA who were homeless or at severe risk of homelessness. Primary outcomes included HIV disease progression, medical care access and utilization, treatment adherence, mental and physical health, and risks of transmitting HIV. Across three study sites, 630 participants completed baseline sessions and were randomized to receive either immediate rental housing assistance (treatment group) or assistance finding housing according to local standard practice (comparison group). Baseline sessions included a questionnaire, a two-session HIV risk-reduction counseling intervention, and blood sample collection to measure CD4 counts and viral load levels. Three follow-up visits occurred at 6, 12, and 18 months after baseline. Participants were mostly male, Black, unmarried, low-income, and nearly half were between 40 and 49 years old. At 18 months, 84% of the baseline sample was retained. The retention rates demonstrate the feasibility of conducting scientifically rigorous housing research, and the baseline results provide important information regarding characteristics of this understudied population that can inform future HIV prevention and treatment efforts.

The data used included the first two waves of a longitudinal study of 160 HIV-infected patients, a population that was 34% women and 65% African American. The Medical Outcome Study-HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV); sleep, cognitive function, and depression scales; the Sickness Impact Profile Home Management Scale; and questions on HIV-related clinical symptoms were administered. Standard gamble utilities and categorical rating scale preferences were assessed for current health state. The MOS-HIV scale scores of asymptomatic patients were significantly higher than those of symptomatic patients and patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. No differences were observed for utilities. Increases in clinical symptoms over 4 months were associated with changes in health perception, pain, physical role function, social function, mental health, depression, energy, cognitive function, and categorical rating scale preferences. The MOS-HIV and other health status measures discriminated between HIV disease stages and were associated with clinical status. Standard gamble utilities did not discriminate among the three groups and were not correlated with clinical status.

Patients not having a resistance mutation may have a better virologic response to treatment than patients with a single mutation. In turn, those with a single mutation may have a better response to treatment than those patients having two mutations, and so on. In the presence of a continuous outcome, Jonckheere's test for ordered alternatives is well adapted to this situation. Such an analysis does not provide any measure of prediction or explained variation which can complement these results. A measure of strength of effect would be helpful in quantifying the degree of association between the genotypic score (number of mutations) and some continuous virological response. We suggest a simple measure of 'goodness of split' for Jonckheere's test for trend. Interestingly, the measure can be related to the non-parametric measure of association known as gamma. The variance formula for the measure studied here can be seen to differ from the known variance estimate of the gamma measure, and simulations show it to be more accurate. Expectation and variance under H(0) of the measure are provided and a large simulation study is presented. Methods are applied to a recent clinical data set involving HIV-1 infected patients where the number of resistance mutations are investigated as potential predictors of the amount of HIV-1 RNA reduction at week 4.

The objective of this study was to evaluate three treatment adherence measures (caregiver reports, pharmacy refill, and appointment maintenance data) in association with viral load suppression in pediatric patients with HIV-1 infection. Although viral suppression was not found to be significantly associated with adherence defined by any single measure, treatment adherence could be predicted if all three measures were in agreement.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define AIDS wasting as involuntary loss of more than 10% of body weight, plus more than 30 days of either diarrhea, or weakness and fever. Wasting syndrome has been considered as a case definition of the AIDS disease since 1987. Wasting syndrome is clearly linked to disease progression and death. Despite the progress under the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), wasting is still a problem for people with AIDS. A small part of the weight lost is fat. More important is the loss of "lean body mass", which is mostly muscle. Body composition changes during HIV infection are different from those observed in food deprivation. Under the era of HAART, a HIV-associated adipose redistribution syndrome (HARS) was described that associates subcutaneous lipoatrophy and abdominal obesity linked to various metabolic disorders. Several factors contribute to wasting syndrome. Not only low food intake and poor nutrient absorption, but mainly altered metabolism (increased resting energy expenditure) and specific disturbances in protein turnover, which is also increased. Nutritional evaluation of HIV-infected patients should include the measurement of body composition and analysis of nutritional parameters, including albumin, transthyretin and C-reactive protein. Transthyretin seems to be particularly useful to follow the recovery period of malnutrition.

Adherence is a challenge in all HIV infected people on ART. It is especially a concern in children because of factors relating to children such as age, disclosure status of HIV sero status, and understanding of the medication. This study assessed the level of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy and its associated factors among children in Gondar University Hospital and Gondar Poly Clinic, Northwest Ethiopia.

The prevalence of hypogonadism is 30 to 50% in HIV infected men with wasting syndrome and 20 to 25% in those without wasting syndrome. HIV infection affects the entire hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis via both direct and indirect effects, which are defined in four categories, 1) direct effect of HIV particles, 2) opportunistic infections, 3) HIV-related malignancy and its treatment, and 4) medications that are used for HIV infection or its opportunistic infection. The association between HIV infection, hypogonadism, and cardiovascular diseases has yet to be determined; however, there are data that HIV infection and its treatment, particularly protease inhibitors, worsened the metabolic profiles, which were surrogate markers of cardiovascular diseases. Considerably more attention should be paid to the diagnosis of hypogonadism in this group particularly because HIV infection increases both sex hormone-binding globulin and total testosterone level. Testosterone replacement shows benefits on mood, body composition, and seems to benefit the metabolic profile in HIV infected men with low body mass index.

To evaluate this system, we performed a pilot study to determine whether ARVs were prescribed according to Brazilian guidelines in place in 2000, and whether prescriptions were refilled in a timely manner. Year 2000 data were abstracted from all medical and pharmacy records of adult patients first registered for HIV/AIDS care in a Rio de Janeiro public clinic from January to June 2000 (n = 67). Results were analysed using frequency analyses, chi-square tests and logistic regression. The patient sample was 41.8% female and had a mean age of 34.9 years. 54 (81%) had AIDS; total sample mean baseline CD4+/viral counts were 276 cells/mm3 and 237 517 copies per millilitre, respectively. Delays between clinic request and receipt of first CD4+/viral load results ranged from 25 to 107 (mean 66) and 33 to 139 (mean 86) days, respectively. Fifty-nine patients (88.1%) were prescribed ARV treatment. Forty-two regimens (71.2%) were highly active antiretroviral therapies; 17 (28.8%) were combination regimens with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. No combinations were prescribed that were contraindicated in Brazilian guidelines, however 33 patients (55.9%) were prescribed ARV drugs before one or both HIV status parameters (initial CD4+ level or viral load) were recorded. Fourteen patients prescribed ARVs (23.7%) lacked a supply of medication for >1 month during the year at least once. Of these patients, 11 had treatment lapses as a result of failure to pick up medications, and three lacked medication because of drug shortages. Medication lapses were associated with female sex, being hospitalized in 2000, and having more than two drugs in regimen, but were not associated with age, CD4+ level or use of ARVs before 2000. The results from this pilot study suggest conservative prescription of HAART, high practitioner adherence to guidelines, and some problems with refilling medications in a timely manner. Monitoring delays were identified as a structural limitation to optimal adherence to practice guidelines. Better access to monitoring-laboratory facilities and greater drug availability would improve programme success.

In-depth interviews were conducted with 28 HIV-positive patients. Results showed that most patients were extremely satisfied with their current primary care physicians. When patients were dissatisfied with their care, it was often because there was a mismatch between the patient's expectations of care and the physician's consultation style. Results also showed that good quality physician-patient relationships tended to promote adherence while lesser quality relationships impeded it. Findings suggest that strengthening and promoting the bonds between physicians and HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients should be an absolute priority, at both the interpersonal level of physician-patient interactions but also at the organizational level.

We pilot-tested a pictorial aid intervention to improve medication adherence for both HIV and common chronic conditions. Adult patients with HIV and diabetes (DM) and/or hypertension (HTN) attending a clinic for underserved patients and at risk for poor health outcomes were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either a pictorial aid intervention (a photographic representation of their medications, the indications, and the dosing schedule) or a standard clinic visit discharge medication list. Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV and therapy for DM or HTN was compared. Predictors of ART adherence at baseline were determined using logistic regression. Medication adherence was assessed using medication possession ratio (MPR) for the 6-month interval before and after the intervention. Change in adherence by treatment group was compared by ANOVA. Among the 46 participants, there was a trend towards higher adherence to medications for HIV compared with medications for hypertension/diabetes (baseline median MPR for ART 0.92; baseline median MPR for the medication for the comorbid condition 0.79, p = 0.07). The intervention was feasible to implement and satisfaction with the intervention was high. With a small sample size, the intervention did not demonstrate significant improvement in adherence to medications for HIV or comorbid conditions. Patients with HIV are often medically complex and may have multiple barriers to medication adherence. Medication adherence is a multifaceted process and adherence promotion interventions require an approach that targets patient-specific barriers.

At present, however, there is still no cure for HIV and those undergoing treatment have to do so for life. The use of antiretroviral drugs has been associated with several toxicities that limit their success. Some acute and chronic toxicities associated with these drugs include hypersensitivity reactions, neurotoxicity, nephropathy, liver damage, the appearance of body fat redistribution syndrome and the different metabolic alterations that accompany it. Some of these toxicities are family- or even drug-specific. Since not all patients that take a particular antiretroviral medication develop the adverse effect that has been attributed to that drug, it has therefore been postulated that there must be a genetically-conditioned individual predisposition to developing the adverse effect. Pharmacogenetics is the science that studies interindividual variations in the response to and toxicity of drugs due to variations in the genetic composition of individuals. Sufficient advances have been made in this discipline to allow this fertile field of research to move out of the basic science laboratory and into clinical applications. The present article reviews the investigations that have been published regarding the association between the genetic determinants of persons infected with HIV and the metabolic toxicity and chronic vascular consequences resulting from antiretroviral drugs. The influence of host genetic variants on dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, lipodystrophy and atherosclerosis are presented and discussed.

We determined the clinical and treatment factors associated with the presence of peripheral sensory neuropathy in HIV+ subjects at baseline examination, and at 1-year follow-up. Baseline examination was assessed with a logistic regression analysis controlling for age, education level, history of drug/alcohol use, and anti-retroviral treatment. The risk of developing new peripheral neuropathy at follow-up was determined using a Cox proportional hazard model analysis. At study entry, neuropathy (n=64) was associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) (i.e. ddC), and history of alcohol abuse. After 1-year follow-up, the development of neuropathy was predicted by AIDS, age (older subjects), and NRTI use. These findings indicated that AIDS, age, alcohol abuse/dependence, and anti-retroviral medication use are important predictors of motor/sensory peripheral neuropathy in the HIV infection. The peripheral neurotoxic effect of anti-retroviral medication should be taken into account in the design of long-term therapies.

Protein and phospholipid composition were determined in 127 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from 89 HIV seropositive patients (54 acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), 35 non-AIDS) and 11 healthy controls. In all of the HIV BAL samples, biochemical abnormalities were found. In subjects with pulmonary infection or Kaposi's sarcoma, the phospholipid/protein ratio was decreased, mainly because of elevated protein levels (15.8 and 20, respectively, vs 7.2 mg.100 ml-1 for controls, p < 0.05). In subjects without obvious pulmonary involvement, phospholipid was decreased (1.3 +/- 0.2 vs 2.9 +/- 0.3 mg.100 ml-1 for controls, p < 0.001), whereas the protein was not altered. Phospholipid composition was also altered: the phosphatidylcholine percentage was decreased, whilst the other main phospholipids were increased. We conclude that the alveolar lining is altered, whatever the stage of HIV disease. In most patients, it results from an increase of vascular permeability, with an influx of serum proteins. However, changes in phospholipid composition suggest that, in some cases, surfactant is also altered.

Testing for chlamydial infection is not available. To gather information on pregnant women, a prevalence survey was conducted in Apia, Samoa, utilizing two prenatal hospital clinics. Pregnant (n=427) women were tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and for syphilis (n=441) by rapid plasmid reagin (RPR) and HIV (n=441) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results were: chlamydia 30.9% (132); trichomoniasis 20.8%; gonorrhoea 3.3%; syphilis 0.5%; and HIV 0%. Overall 42.7% had at least 1 STD. Young women aged <25 years were three times more likely to have a STD than older women (odds ratio=3.0, 95% confidence intervals 2.0, 4.5).

HBV markers were found in altogether 70 persons, of whom 7 were HBsAg carriers. Those chronically infected were all born in HBV intermediate/high endemic areas. Gonorrhoea was the only STD that was correlated to an increased risk of HBV markers. Number of sexual partners, sex and age was not correlated with HBV infection, irrespective of country of origin. The risk of having HBV markers in an STD clientele in Copenhagen was highly dependent on the country of birth, as the prevalences were 7% (21/307) in persons born in Denmark, 19% (9/47) in those born in other low endemic areas and 36% (40/111) in those born in intermediate/high endemic areas. Falling incidence of gonorrhoea and other STD may render it difficult to point out risk factors indicative of HBV immunization in heterosexual STD patients. In low-risk countries, screening for HBV markers should however be offered to all immigrants and refugees as a part of an HBV immunization program.

Food insecurity (FI) is emerging as an important barrier to adherence to care and treatment recommendations for people living with HIV (PLHIV), but this relationship has not been comprehensively examined. Therefore, we reviewed the literature to explore how FI may impact ART adherence, retention in medical care, and adherence to health care recommendations among PLHIV. We found data to support FI as a critical barrier to adherence to ART and to other health care recommendations among HIV-infected adults, HIV-infected pregnant women and their HIV-exposed infants, and child and adolescent populations of PLHIV. Associations between FI and ART non-adherence were seen in qualitative and quantitative studies. We identified a number of mechanisms to explain how food insecurity and ART non-adherence may be causally linked, including the exacerbation of hunger or ART side effects in the absence of adequate food and competing resource demands. Interventions that address FI may improve adherence to care and treatment recommendations for PLHIV.

The main barrier to adherence as identified by participants in the study was the stigma associated with living with HIV, and thus with receiving AIDS treatment. A second barrier was the fact that some patients willfully decide to forgo treatment so that they could retain state disability benefits associated with a low CD4 count. Other barriers included the lack of finances for transport to clinics and food insecurity, especially when medication needed to be taken with food. These barriers to ART adherence are conceptualized in terms of Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory.

In order to identify immunological factors affecting discordant treatment responses, a total of 27 HIV-infected patients were studied: (a) 10 naive patients (mean CD4+ = 101.5 cells/microl; mean HIV-RNA = 4.8 log10 copies/ml); (b) seven responder patients (mean CD4+ = 908.9 cells/microl); and (c) 10 discordant patients (mean CD4+ = 396.1 cells/microl; mean HIV-RNA = 5.4 log10 copies/ml). Five healthy blood donors were included as HIV-seronegative controls. The following parameters were evaluated: interleukin (IL)-15 production by monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) after stimulation with lypopolysaccaride (LPS) and Candida albicans; recall and HIV-1-specific antigen lymphocyte proliferation (LP). Increased levels of IL-15 production by MDDC after stimulation with LPS and C. albicans were found both in discordant patients and responder patients. Conversely, a strong reduction of IL-15 levels was observed in naive patients. Discordant patients developed positive LP responses to C. albicans and HIV-1 p24. LP in response to C. albicans and HIV-1 p24 was also positive in responder patients. Decreased LP response was found in naive patients. In conclusion, HIV-infected patients with discordant viro-immunological responses to HAART present increased levels of IL-15 production by MDDC and enhanced recall and HIV-1-specific antigen LP responses, suggesting an improvement in indices of immune function.

Influence of human immunodeficiency virus infection., Abstract: Control of genital ulcer disease (GUD) is a proposed intervention to slow the dissemination of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Programs for the control of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) should focus on groups of high-frequency transmitters, such as prostitutes and their clientele. This study illustrates the interaction between the prevalence of chancroid, use of barrier prophylaxis against STDs, and HIV infection in a population of female prostitutes in Nairobi. Four hundred and twenty three women were evaluated. Despite the increased use of condoms, the prevalence of genital ulcers remained constant between 1986-87 and 1987-88. Genital ulcer disease was simultaneously associated with HIV infection (adjusted odds ratio: 3.7, P less than .01) whereas it was independently and inversely associated with more consistent condom use (P less than .01). The authors conclude that genital ulcer disease can be controlled in these populations but concurrent HIV infection increases the difficulty of this intervention.

Food insecurity can act as a real barrier to adherence to both of these factors. Many people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) treated with ART in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are faced with nutritional challenges. A significant proportion are affected by under nutrition, which frequently leads to therapeutic failure. Some HIV care facilities recommend supplementation with Moringa oleifera (M.O.) Lam. leaf powder to combat marginal and major nutritional deficiencies. This study aims to assess the impact of M.O. Lam. leaf powder supplementation compared to nutritional counseling on the nutritional and immune status of PLHIV treated with ART.

Hence, this study was planned to investigate the effects of fish oil on lipid profile, insulin resistance, and body fat distribution in HIV-infected Brazilian patients on antiretroviral therapy, considering that marine omega-3 fatty acids seem to improve features of the metabolic syndrome. We conducted a randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled trial that assessed the effects of 3 g fish oil/day (540 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid plus 360 mg of docosahexaenoic acid) or 3 g soy oil/day (placebo) on 83 HIV-infected Brazilian men and non-pregnant women on antiretroviral therapy. No statistically significant relationships between fish oil supplementation and longitudinal changes in triglyceride (p = 0.335), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.078), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.383), total cholesterol (p = 0.072), apolipoprotein B (p = 0.522), apolipoprotein A1 (p = 0.420), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/apolipoprotein B ratio (p = 0.107), homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance index (p = 0.387), body mass index (p = 0.068), waist circumference (p = 0.128), and waist/hip ratio (p = 0.359) were observed. A low dose of fish oil did not alter lipid profile, insulin resistance, and body fat distribution in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy.

A macaque models of AIDS could greatly facilitate an in vivo approach to the pathogenesis of such dysfunction. Here, we evaluated in this model the impact of infection with a pathogenic simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) on bone marrow hematopoiesis. Three groups of macaques were inoculated with 50 50% median infective doses of pathogenic SHIV 89.P, which expresses env of dual-tropic HIV type 1 (HIV-1) 89.6 primary isolate. During the primary phase of infection, animals were treated with either a placebo or highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) combining zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir, initiated 4 or 72 h postinfection (p.i.) and administered twice a day until day 28 p.i. In both placebo-treated and HAART-treated animals, bone marrow colony-forming cells (CFC) progressively decreased quite early, during the first month p.i. One year p.i., both placebo- and HAART-treated animals displayed decreases in CFC to about 56% of preinfection values. At the same time, a dramatic decrease (greater than 77%) of bone marrow CD34(+) long-term culture-initiating cells was noted in all animals were found. No statistically significant differences between placebo- and HAART-treated monkeys were found. These data argue for an early and profound alteration of myelopoiesis at the level of the most primitive CD34(+) progenitor cells during SHIV infection, independently of the level of viremia, circulating CD4(+) cell counts, or antiviral treatment.

In this secondary analysis of a placebo controlled trial of rosuvastatin among 147 HIV+ subjects (median age 46; 78% men) on stable antiretroviral therapy, we aimed to evaluate longitudinal associations between computed tomography (CT) measures of pericardial fat (PCF) volume and density, insulin resistance, and inflammation. We measured PCF volume and density (mean attenuation in Hounsfield units) by noncontrast gated CT at baseline and week 96. Homeostatic model of insulin resistance was calculated from fasting insulin and glucose at entry, 24, 48, and 96 weeks. At baseline, insulin resistance correlated positively with PCF volume and negatively with density. Similarly divergent correlations of volume and density were observed with waist:hip ratio, nadir CD4+ count, and duration of antiretroviral therapy. In a linear mixed model, PCF density was associated with insulin resistance independent of PCF volume, body mass index, metabolic syndrome, and biomarkers of immune activation and systemic inflammation; however, baseline PCF measures were not associated with longitudinal changes in insulin resistance. Soluble CD163, a marker of monocyte activation, positively correlated with PCF volume and was associated with insulin resistance in linear models. Statin treatment assignment did not affect PCF volume or density change (both p > 0.8). In conclusion, the quantity and quality (i.e., radiodensity) of PCF are differentially related to insulin resistance and inflammation in patients with treated HIV infection.

The aim of the present study was to further examine the influences exercised by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; formerly called human T-lymphotropic virus type III or lymphadenopathy-associated virus, HTLV-III/LAV) on normal human B lymphocytes. An unfractionated protein preparation, made from HIV purified by density gradient centrifugation, was previously shown to induce differentiation of normal human B lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. In the present analyses, this B-lymphocyte response peaked on day 6 or 7 after culture initiation and was found to be independent of the requirement for monocytes but to require T cells. Responses could also be elicited in cultures of purified B cells by the addition of T cells that had been exposed to HIV antigen. Inhibitors of protein synthesis (puromycin and cycloheximide) abrogated the responses. In contrast to its stimulatory effects, the same virus preparation was previously shown to inhibit polyclonal responses that are normally elicited in peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures by a T-dependent stimulus (pokeweed mitogen) and T-independent stimulus (Epstein-Barr virus). The present studies suggest that the inhibitory effects of the HIV antigen studied herein are targeted primarily at the B lymphocytes. The role of T lymphocytes in the HIV antigen-mediated inhibitory effects, although demonstrated, could not be conclusively established as an essential pathway. These findings elucidate mechanisms by which components of HIV exert stimulatory as well as inhibitory effects on human B lymphocytes and thereby lead to the dysfunction of these cells in HIV infection.

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of tenofovir DF in adolescents with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adolescents 12 to <18 years of age with CHB were randomized to tenofovir DF 300 mg (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) once daily for 72 weeks. The primary endpoint was virologic response (HBV DNA <400 copies/mL) at week 72. One hundred six patients were enrolled; 101 patients completed 72 weeks of treatment. At baseline, 91% of patients were hepatitis B e antigen-positive and 85% had prior exposure to HBV therapy. A virologic response was observed in 89% (46/52) of patients who received tenofovir DF and 0% (0/54) of patients who received placebo (P < 0.001). Treatment response was not affected by prior HBV treatment. Furthermore, no resistance to tenofovir DF developed through week 72. Among patients with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level greater than the upper limit of normal at baseline, normalization of ALT occurred in 74% of patients receiving tenofovir DF and 31% of patients receiving placebo (P < 0.001). The rate of grade 3/4 adverse events was higher among patients treated with placebo (24%) than patients treated with tenofovir DF (10%). No patients met the safety endpoint of a 6% decrease in spine bone mineral density at week 72.

An atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype has been described in HIV- infected patients with a predominance of small, low density lipoprotein (SLDL) particles with accompanying elevated triglycerides and reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol. This randomized controlled pilot study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Extended Release Niacin (ERN) in improving the lipid profile in HIV patients. A total of 17 HIV positive subjects on HAART therapy with High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL) levels below 40mg/dl and Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL) below 130mg/dl were enrolled. Nine were randomized to be treated with ERN titrated from a starting level of 500mg/night and titrated to a level of 1500mg/night. Eight patients were assigned to the control arm. No placebo was used. Lipoprotein profiles of the subjects were analyzed at baseline and at the end of 12 weeks using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. At the end of 12 weeks, NMR spectroscopic analysis revealed a significant increase in overall LDL size (1.2% in ERN treated subjects vs 2.0% decrease in control patients, P=.04) and a decrease in small LDL particle concentration (17.0% in ERN treated subjects vs 21.4% increase in control patients, P=.03) in subjects receiving ERN as compared to those in the control group. Only 1 subject receiving ERN developed serious flushing which was attributed to an accidental overdose of the drug. This pilot study demonstrates that ERN therapy in HIV-infected patients with low HDL is safe and effective in improving the lipoprotein profile in these patients.

Significant clinical benefits and adverse experiences have been reported from this trial. Because neuropsychiatric dysfunction is often associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a brief affective and neuropsychological examination was administered over 16 weeks of the trial to evaluate any changes in neuropsychological function that occurred with drug administration. Patients receiving zidovudine, particularly those with AIDS, showed improved cognition as compared with patients receiving placebo. There were no changes in affective symptoms. The zidovudine recipients also had a statistically significant reduction in the intensity of symptomatic distress during the trial that may account in part for the observed cognitive changes. Some improvement in various cognitive measures was also seen in patients with AIDS-related complex. The results of this study suggest HIV-associated cognitive abnormalities may be partially ameliorated after the administration of zidovudine.

The goal of this study was to determine if sclerostin is related to bone physiology and cardiovascular disease during antiretroviral treatment in HIV-infected persons. This was a cross-sectional analysis from study entry into the Stopping Atherosclerosis and Treating Unhealthy bone with RosuvastatiN in HIV (SATURN) trial, an ongoing randomized trial comparing rosuvastatin to placebo in HIV-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy. Plasma sclerostin was measured at study entry by ELISA from participants with available samples. Spearman correlation and multivariable linear regression were used to test relationships between sclerostin and bone density or bone turnover and cardiovascular disease. Among 139 HIV-infected participants (median age 46 years, CD4 lymphocyte count 614 cells/μl), the median plasma sclerostin level was 444.1 (IQR 330.3, 570.1) pg/ml. Correlations were detected between sclerostin and age (r=0.26), lumbar spine Z-score (r=0.31), RANKL (r=-0.21), carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT, r=0.19), and sVCAM-1 (r=0.27), p<0.05. No significant correlations were detected between sclerostin and current (r=0.006) or nadir CD4 count (r=0.11). While associations between sclerostin, lumbar spine Z-score, and sVCAM-1 were robust to covariate adjustment (p<0.01), association with CIMT was no longer significant (p=0.08). Our findings provide preliminary support for a relationship between sclerostin and bone mineral density in HIV-infected persons. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway should be investigated as a potential mechanism for loss of bone mineral density in treated HIV infection.

Survey data were collected from 133 individuals, (47 parents, 53 siblings, 33 adult family members who have HIV/AIDS) representing 80 families. In-depth interview and observational data were collected from a subset of the sample. The physical and psychological health of individual family members was assessed by the 53-item Brief Symptom Inventory. Parents, siblings, and people living with AIDS (PWAs) reported higher levels of overall distress and scored higher on symptom dimensions and clinically discrete symptoms than normative comparison groups. Implications of these findings for research, clinical practice, and health and social service policy are identified and discussed.

In order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of antiretroviral regimen containing emtricitabine in the clinical practice, we performed an observational study on all patients starting a regimens containing emtricitabine in a clinical unit. Data were collected from clinical charts and inserted into a computerized database. We evaluated the following outcome measures: probability of interruption of FTC-regimen due to side effects; time to virologic suppression in patients with detectable viral load at baseline; time to loss of virologic efficacy in patients with virologic suppression at baseline, immunologic variations. In the period January 2005- March 2006, overall 150 patients started a FTC-regimen; 16.7% of them were naïve to antiretroviral treatment. The median period of observation was 80 days (IQR 26-190) and 26.7% of patients had a longitudinal observation longer than 24 weeks. At last observation, 82% of patients were still continuing baseline regimen and 13.3% interrupted FTC. Efficacy analysis in viremic patients showed that 6 months-probability of virologic success during treatment with FTC was 74.7%. Our preliminary observation show that FTC-regimens seems effective and tolerable in real practice.

In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), while PROs are used in research, their application in clinical practice has been limited despite their potential utility. PRO selection is an important consideration when contemplating their use. As past reviews of PROs in HIV have focused on particular areas (e.g. disability, satisfaction with care), a more comprehensive review could better inform on the available instruments and their scope. This article reviews HIV-specific PROs to produce an inventory and to identify the central concepts targeted over time. Seven databases were searched (HAPI, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar), generating 14,794 records for evaluation. From these records, 117 HIV-specific PROs were identified and categorized based on a content analysis of their targeted concept: Health-Related Quality of Life (23; 20 %), ART and Adherence-Related Views and Experiences (19; 16 %), Healthcare-Related Views and Experiences (15; 13 %), Psychological Challenges (12; 10 %), Symptoms (12; 10 %), Psychological Resources (10; 9 %), HIV Self-Management and Self-Care (8; 7 %), HIV-Related Stigma (8; 7 %), Body and Facial Appearance (4; 3 %), Social Support (3; 3 %), Sexual and Reproductive Health (2; 2 %), and Disability (1; 1 %). This review highlights the variety and evolution of HIV-specific PROs, with the arrival of seven categories of PROs only after the advent of highly-active antiretroviral therapy. Our inventory also offers a useful resource. However, the interest of further HIV-specific PRO development should be explored in sexual health, which received little independent attention.

A single-center, retrospective chart review of co-infected patients was conducted from June 2014 to February 2015. Significant interactions between simeprevir (SMV), ledipasvir (LDV), and paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir plus dasabuvir (3D regimen) with ART were identified based on available literature. SMV had the largest number of DDIs and was further investigated to determine the feasibility of ART switch to allow for DAA use. Of 127 subjects, 23% had advanced liver disease; 86% of those with known HCV genotype were HCV genotype 1. An ART switch allowing use of SMV, LDV, and 3D regimen was recommended in 97/127 (76%), 81/127 (64%), and 91/127 (72%) patients, respectively. Subjects on PI/r regimens had limited options for ART switch, with 40% of these patients unable to be switched to an ART regimen that avoided the use of a PI. In conclusion, the majority of HIV/HCV co-infected patients will be recommended to switch ART prior to use of interferon-free, DAA regimens, and an ART switch may not be feasible for more than a third of patients on a boosted PI. DDIs between ART and DAAs represent an additional barrier to treatment efficacy in clinical practice settings that are unaccounted for in clinical trials.

Three-hundred two adult ambulatory HIV/AIDS patients were consecutively recruited from HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics at 2 teaching hospitals in Uganda. The presence and intensity of pain were self-reported using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI); symptom data were collected using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS-SF); and quality of life (QOL) was assessed using the Medical Outcome Scale-HIV. Forty-seven percent reported pain in the 7 days prior to the survey and pain was a symptom at the time of diagnosis for 68%. On the 0 to 10 numeric scale, 53% reported mild pain (1-4 rating), 20% reported moderate pain (5-6 rating) while 27% reported severe pain (7-10 rating). Gender was not associated with pain intensity, but reduced functional performance, increasing number of symptoms, advanced HIV disease , physical symptom distress (MSAS-SF), and number of health comorbidities were significantly associated with pain intensity (P < .04). Increasing pain intensity was associated with greater functional ability impairment (BPI functional interference index) and poorer QOL. Pain is a common symptom among ambulatory HIV/AIDS patients and has a debilitating effect on QOL. There is a significant unmet need for pain relief in the population.

We assessed this using updated administrative data from an open retrospective cohort of HIV-infected persons receiving care from the US Veterans Affairs (VA). Information on 41,213 HIV-infected patients receiving VA care between January 1993 and December 2003 was included. Patients were followed for an average of 4 years or 168,213 person-years of follow-up. The death rate fell from 20.9 deaths per 100 patient-years of observation in 1995 to 5.2 deaths per 100 patient-years in 2003. In patient-level analysis, adjusted hazard ratios for death dropped precipitously for all races to a low of 0.18 (95% confidence interval: 0.15 to 0.23) at 72 months of exposure to HAART. Hazards for serious cardiovascular events remained near 1.0 for exposure to HAART, and hazards for serious cardiovascular events, stroke, or death were only slightly higher than for death alone. No selection effects or secular trends were found. The benefits of HAART continued to increase in the 8 years after introduction and with 6 years of individual use. The risk of serious cardiovascular events should be factored into individual patient management but does not pose an important public health risk.

Approximately 60% of the participants had prehypertension to stage 2 hypertension. In the base model, older patients (P<.0001), men (P=.003), and patients with poorer self-reported health (P=.029) were significantly associated with high SBP, whereas older age (P<.001) and higher body mass index (P<.001) were significantly associated with higher DBP. After adjusting for the base model, high frequency of alcohol drinking and high frequency of binge drinking remained significant for high SBP and DBP. These data suggest that future cardiovascular disease programs should target moderate alcohol consumption to improve blood pressure among individuals at high risk for HIV/STIs.

The prevalence of hypogonadism is 30 to 50% in HIV infected men with wasting syndrome and 20 to 25% in those without wasting syndrome. HIV infection affects the entire hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis via both direct and indirect effects, which are defined in four categories, 1) direct effect of HIV particles, 2) opportunistic infections, 3) HIV-related malignancy and its treatment, and 4) medications that are used for HIV infection or its opportunistic infection. The association between HIV infection, hypogonadism, and cardiovascular diseases has yet to be determined; however, there are data that HIV infection and its treatment, particularly protease inhibitors, worsened the metabolic profiles, which were surrogate markers of cardiovascular diseases. Considerably more attention should be paid to the diagnosis of hypogonadism in this group particularly because HIV infection increases both sex hormone-binding globulin and total testosterone level. Testosterone replacement shows benefits on mood, body composition, and seems to benefit the metabolic profile in HIV infected men with low body mass index.

A clustering of such factors (metabolic syndrome [MSDR]) exponentially increases the risk. Impaired fibrinolysis and increased coagulation are additional independent risk factors for CHD. We studied the effects of protease inhibitor (PI)-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on metabolic and hemostatic parameters in 363 HIV-infected individuals, of whom 266 were receiving PI-containing HAART and 97 were treatment naive. The fasting plasma levels of insulin, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), and fibrinogen were evaluated together with the areas of visceral adipose tissue and the visceral adipose tissue/subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio. The levels of insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; visceral adipose tissue area; low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein ratio; and visceral adipose tissue/subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio were significantly increased in patients receiving PI-containing HAART compared with treatment-naive patients. The levels of PAI-1 and fibrinogen were significantly higher in patients receiving PI-containing HAART. PAI-1 levels were higher in individuals with MSDR but also in patients without MSDR who were receiving PI-containing HAART. PAI-1 was independently correlated to use of PI-containing HAART, triglyceride level, insulin level, and body mass index (p <.001). These findings suggest that patients receiving PI-containing HAART have decreased fibrinolysis and increased coagulability, which may thus represent additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease in this patient group.

Other contributing factors to cardiovascular risk may include uncontrolled HIV replication, the effects of HIV and ART on vascular endothelium and inflammatory cytokines. Diastolic dysfunction may be an early sign of cardiovascular disease. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of diastolic dysfunction in HIV-infected patients without cardiovascular symptoms. We enrolled 91 subjects in a cross-sectional study of HIV-infected patients without cardiovascular symptoms between September 2004 and August 2005, to assess whether demographics, HIV-related factors, cardiac risk factors, and ART were associated with diastolic dysfunction. All subjects underwent two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography with tissue Doppler imaging. Subjects were predominately male with a median age of 38 (interquartile range [IQR]: 33, 42) years and median ART duration 6.15 (IQR: 2.1, 8.4) years. Subjects had low Framingham risk scores. Diastolic dysfunction was observed in 34 patients (37%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 27.4, 48.1). Cardiac risk factors or poor prognostic indicators of AIDS progression were uncommon with no difference between subjects with or without diastolic dysfunction. A nonstatistically significant trend in increased rate of diastolic dysfunction was observed in patients receiving protease inhibitors 1 year or more, 44% versus 28%, respectively (univariate odds ratio 2.02, 95% CI 0.83 to 4.90). This was not observed with prolonged use of either non-nucleoside or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. A high prevalence of diastolic dysfunction (37%) in a cohort of HIV-infected patients on ART at low risk for AIDS and cardiovascular disease was demonstrated.

The aim of this study was to examine the associations between adherence and severity of substance use as well as adherence and severity of depressive symptoms among Iranian HIV patients. In a prospective study, HIV patients with current substance use were assessed for adherence level via self report and pill count methods, severity of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory- II) and substance use (Addiction Severity Index) during a three months follow up after initiating antiretroviral therapy. The adherence level, severity of depressive symptoms and substance use were assessed one month, two months and three months after initiation of anti-retroviral therapy. Addiction Severity Index (ASI) composite scores were calculated for each domain and the associations between ASI domains and adherence as well as severity of depressive symptoms and adherence were assessed. Twenty six HIV patients with current substance use disorder completed the study. At the end of the first month, adherence to therapy via pill count and self-report were 80%±31.9% and 85.12%±32%, respectively. At the end of the second month, adherence to therapy via pill count and self report were 87%±32% and 93.94%±23% respectively. At the end of the third month, the measured adherence via pill count and self report were 85%±33.7% and 90.1%±25.7% respectively. Adherence was higher among married patients and those who used reminder systems. Composite scores of the medical status and psychiatric status were related to higher adherence after first month. Substance use was inversely associated with adherence at the second follow up (r=-0.4, p=0.04). Also, severity of depressive symptoms was not related to adherence level. The repeated measurement analysis showed a significant decrease in psychiatric status domain of the ASI composite score after three months of initiating therapy (p=0.02). Preventive measures should aim treatment of substance use among HIV patients in order to increase adherence level. Also, conducting psychological evaluations is necessary considering the high prevalence of depression among Iranian HIV patients.

Clinical examinations and iron and vitamin B(12) assays were performed, and complete blood counts, serum folic acid levels, and CD4 cell count determined. The prevalence of anemia was significantly higher among HIV-positive women (29%) than among HIV-negative women (8%) (P < 0.001). Risk factors for anemia were lower body mass index (odds ratio [OR] = 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.4-4.1), zidovudine use (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.01-1.29), lack of HAART (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.21-1.67), oral candidiasis (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.2-1.6), pulmonary tuberculosis (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.7-2.2), cryptococcal meningitis (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.21-1.8), Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.20-1.65) and CD4 lymphocyte count < 200 cells/μL (OR = 2.41, 95% CI = 2.01-3.07). The mean ± SD hemoglobin level of 10.9 ± 1.6 g/dL at HAART initiation significantly increased to 12.3 ± 1.5 g/dL in 8 months (P < 0.001). Anemia increases with HIV stage, and HAART is associated with a significant improvement in hemoglobin levels.

Eligible patients were those enrolled in a national prospective observational cohort (Antiretroviral Resistance Cohort Analysis), starting first-line cART between 2001 and 2011 and who had at least one follow-up of HIV-1 RNA. The primary endpoint was virological success, defined as the first viral load <50  copies/ml. Time to events were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard model. One thousand three hundred five patients met the study inclusion criteria. In a multivariable model adjusting for transmission mode, presence of transmitted drug resistance, baseline CD4(+) cell count, viral subtype, and type of NRTI backbone employed, independent predictors of virological success were higher baseline viral load (≥500,000 vs. <100,000 HR 0.52; P < 0.001), a weighted genotypic susceptibility score (wGSS) <3 (HR 0.58; P = 0.003), male sex (HR 0.76 P = 0.001), and type of initial third drug employed (integrase inhibitor vs. boosted protease inhibitors HR 3.23; P < 0.001). In the subset with HIV-1 RNA >100,000  copies/ml, virologic success was only associated with the use of integrase inhibitors in the first cART regimen. Independent predictors of immunological success were baseline CD4(+) cell count and wGSS <3. High baseline HIV-1 RNA, predicted activity of the first-line regimen based on genotypic resistance testing, gender, and use of new agents were found to predict time to achieve virological success. The type of initial nucleoside analog backbone was not found to predict virological response.

Patients were followed up for a median of 61 months after infection, the dates of infection being either known exactly or estimated from the interval between the last negative and first positive HIV antibody test result. The rate of progression to AIDS was significantly higher for the transfusion recipients than for the haemophiliacs. The difference in time to the occurrence of the first clinical symptom was less pronounced between the two groups, though pointing in the same direction. The results suggest that on average roughly half of all patients positive for HIV will develop some clinical sign or symptom within five to six years after infection.

However, there is a lack of studies examining this symptom. We investigated the prevalence of pruritus and its causes in this population by offering the possibility of participating in a skin health programme to all HIV-infected patients who attended our service in Alicante, Spain. Those who accepted (n = 303) underwent an interview and a detailed physical examination by specialists from the Dermatology Department. Between May 2003 and October 2003, 94 patients (31%) reported pruritus: xerosis, seborrhoeic eczema and interdigital tinea pedis were the most frequent dermatological entities responsible for this symptom. Patients with pruritus had higher viral loads (P = 0.006). We conclude that pruritus is still a frequent symptom in HIV-infected patients. To the best of our knowledge this is the first prevalence study of pruritus in an HIV population in the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era.

Very high, persistent levels of plasma RNA and proviral DNA were detected throughout the study period, suggesting the absence of an effective immune response. Most patients had normal CD4 lymphocyte counts and were symptom free for the first 3 to 6 months despite high levels of viral replication. These findings support the evaluation of early intervention (before symptoms develop) and efforts to establish the predictive value of these assays.

Los Angeles County Pediatric AIDS Consortium and the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center and the University of Southern California School of Medicine., Abstract: Using community-based surveillance data for pediatric human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, we examined disease progression using survival analysis among perinatally HIV-infected children and children HIV-infected through a neonatal blood transfusion. As of December 31, 1991, 238 HIV-infected children (classified P-1 or P-2 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification system) were identified. Median symptom-free survival time from birth to symptomatic infection (P-2) was different for perinatally acquired (n = 166) and neonatal transfusion-acquired (n = 72) infection (6.4 months vs. 17.8 months, respectively; P < 0.001). Survival after development of symptomatic infection (P-2) did not differ by transmission mode. Survival differences from birth to death were significant at P < 0.05 (75% of perinatally HIV-infected children survived 44 months vs. 71 months for transfusion-associated children). Although survival estimates improved for those receiving antiretroviral treatment, differences by mode were still observed. For perinatally HIV-infected children, mortality was highest in the first year of life (12%). Those remaining symptom-free beyond their first year demonstrated survival experiences similar to those for children with transfusion-associated infection.

These cases showed dementia, bradykinesia, dysarthria, hemiparesis, and so on. All of the cases were severely immunocompromised hosts, because none had more than 150/mm3 CD4 + lymphocytes; indeed, 5 of the cases were below 20/mm3. Other neurological complications except PML were primary CNS lymphoma, HIV encephalitis, and CMV encephalitis. The mean life durations was 7.6 months after the first symptom appeared, for all but one of the patients; the exceptional patient lived for 24 months after. Autopsy studies of the central nervous systems were performed for 7 cases, all of which showed extensive demyelinating lesions of the white matter, and in some cases these extended into the spinal cord. In contrast to Western countries, in Japan there have been few reports of AIDS-associated PML. Thus, this report was thought to be important here.

These patients have a low chance of achieving a sustained virologic response (SVR) using first generation triple-therapy, with a success rate of only 20%.

In HIV-infected patients, TB is the most common severe opportunistic infection. Few studies have evaluated risk factors for TB treatment default in HIV-infected patients. We conducted a prospective, observational study of HIV-infected TB patients in Thailand. Patients underwent standardised evaluations at the beginning of TB treatment, at the end of the intensive phase and at the end of TB treatment. TB treatment outcomes were assessed according to WHO guidelines. The analysis was limited to patients who defaulted or who had treatment success. Of the 554 patients analysed, 61 (11%) defaulted. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with TB treatment default included incarceration history [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.7), smoking (AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-4.1) and having a symptom complaint score >15 (AOR 3.4, 95% CI 1.4-8.0); one marker of wealth, namely owning a refrigerator, was protective (AOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8). Default during TB treatment was a significant problem in HIV-infected patients. Reducing default may require enhancing services for patients with a history of incarceration or smoking and designing patient-centred systems to address poverty and patient wellness.

A multivariate analysis of post-HAART initiation exposures found that high HIV RNA levels (relative hazard [RH] = 1.36, P < 0.001) and high depressive symptom scores (RH = 1.53, P = 0.012) were associated with HAART discontinuation. The adjusted hazard of discontinuation was higher in the 2 most recent calendar periods compared with the first (RH = 1.61, P = 0.026; RH = 1.56, P = 0.074, respectively). The increasing risk of HAART discontinuation in recent calendar periods and changes in the clinical factors associated with discontinuation reflect ongoing and dynamic shifts in the approach to HAART utilization.

DILS primarily occurs in the salivary glands, lungs, renal interstitium, and gastrointestinal tract. DILS differs from Sjogren's syndrome in the degree of salivary gland enlargement, high frequency of extraglandular manifestations, paucity of autoantibodies, and distinct immunogenetic associations. Salivary gland B-cell lymphoma is a complication common to both conditions. The circulating CD8 T cells in DILS have a memory phenotype. Egress into target tissues involves adhesion molecule receptor-ligand interactions, apparently in response to the local presence of HIV-1. Immunogenetic predisposition involves interaction between both MHC classes I and II loci. This disease appears to reflect a specific host response that leads to persistence of monocyte-tropic, rather than T-cell-tropic, HIV-1 strains, in an analogous fashion to Visna Maedi virus disease in sheep. The development of DILS in children appears to be regulated in a dominant fashion by maternally or paternally inherited MHC class II alleles in response to transplacentally or perinatally acquired maternal HIV-1 strains.

Some MBL genetic polymorphisms result in deficient protein levels and increased susceptibility to infection. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between MBL2 exon 1 polymorphisms, serum levels of normal MBL, and HIV-1 infection and progression in a Chinese population. A total of 1075 adult patients infected with HIV-1 (532 male and 543 female) were recruited. The genotype of 145 patients was determined and the genotype frequencies compared with healthy population controls. The disease status of patients was evaluated for different MBL2 genotypes and normal MBL serum levels. MBL2 exon 1 polymorphisms (A/O or O/O) were significantly more common in HIV-1-infected patients than in the healthy controls. Patients in clinical categories B/C with severe diseases were significantly more likely to have one variant allele. There was a statistical relationship between MBL2 genotypes and MBL serum levels. In addition, higher CD4(+) T cell counts and ratios of CD4(+) T cells:CD8(+) T cells were observed in patients with medium MBL levels than with low or high MBL levels. Patients with mild diseases were also more likely to have medium MBL levels than high levels. Analysis of MBL levels with respect to sex yielded differences. Median MBL levels were substantially higher in males than in females in HIV-1-infected patients. Lower CD4(+) T cell counts were detected in males with low MBL levels, but the opposite was observed in females. Our results suggest that genetic polymorphisms resulting in MBL deficiency are associated with increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and disease progression in the studied population. Moreover, serum circulating levels of normal MBL in HIV-1-infected patients could be an important auxiliary biological marker in association with CD4(+) T cell counts in the evaluation of HIV-1 disease progression. The sex differences in the regulation of MBL serum levels during infection merit further exploration.
=> 4th document retrieved: Order: 7959, Title: HIV infection and stroke., Abstract: The landscape of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is changing with the increasing coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Patients are living longer but continually exposed to a virologically suppressed HIV infection. This has resulted in a decrease in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complications such as opportunistic infections, and an increase in non-AIDS complications such as stroke. In this era, stroke is perhaps the most important neurologic complication of HIV infection. Furthermore, stroke is more of a heterogeneous disease in people living with HIV infection and therefore needs to be approached systematically. Many of the etiologies are treatable. HIV-associated vasculopathy is perhaps the most common etiology in this population and our understanding of this is still evolving. Moreover, the treatment of HIV infection may contribute to an excess risk of stroke and interact with stroke therapies.

Infection of mononuclear phagocytes from healthy individuals by virulent MTB is associated with expression of the antiapoptotic molecule protease inhibitor 9 (PI-9), and PI-9 contributes to successful parasitism of macrophages by MTB. Here we studied the contribution of PI-9 to successful MTB infection of monocytes from HIV-1-infected patients.

Levels of sEs in HIV-infected individuals without AIDS, according to the 1993 classification system of the Centers for Disease Control, were higher than normal (mean +/- SEM 48 +/- 4 versus 35 +/- 3 ng/ml, p = 0.003). Patients with established AIDS, who were afebrile and had no evidence of acute concurrent infection, had even higher sEs serum levels (70 +/- 9 ng/ml, p = 0.009, compared to those without AIDS). A significant increase in clinical category disease progression was present. Individual concentrations of sEs correlated directly with levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (p < 0.00001) and IL-2 receptor (p = 0.001), but not with CD4+ T-cell counts. Zidovudine treatment was not associated with changes in sEs serum levels. Elevated sEs levels were also found in HIV-seronegative patients with other bacterial and protozoal infections. Since sEs is a biologically active molecule, further studies should investigate the pathogenetic significance of circulating sEs in HIV-related disease progression, and assess the prognostic value of sEs determination for these patients.

Using a double polymerase chain reaction which allows the detection of single molecules of provirus and a method of quantifying the provirus molecules, we have measured provirus frequencies in infected individuals down to a level of one molecule per 10(6) PBMCs. As a general rule, only a small proportion of PBMCs contain provirus (median value of samples from 12 patients, one per 8,000 cells), and most if not all of the infected cells carry a single provirus molecule. The frequency of provirus-carrying cells correlated positively both with the progression of the disease and with the success with which virus could be isolated from the same patients by cocultivation methods. Of seven asymptomatic (Centers for Disease Control stage II) patients, all but one contained one provirus molecule per 6,000 to 80,000 cells; of five Centers for Disease Control stage IV patients, all but one contained one provirus molecule per 700 to 3,300 cells. When considered in conjunction with estimates of the frequency of PBMCs that express viral RNA, our results suggest that either (i) the majority of provirus-containing cells are monocytes or (ii) most provirus-containing lymphocytes are transcriptionally inactive. We also present nucleotide sequence data derived directly from provirus present in vivo which we show is not marred by the in vitro selection of potential virus variants or by errors introduced by Taq polymerase. We argue from these data that, of the provirus present in infected individuals, the proportion which is defective is not high in the regions sequenced.

Using allogeneic T cells from uninfected volunteers as responders, the current studies demonstrate that Mo from infected individuals were comparable to Mo from uninfected volunteers as AC in Con A and pokeweed mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation assays, but were inferior to normal Mo in stimulating a mixed leukocyte reaction. This deficiency was not explained by HIV Mo-induced suppression of lymphoproliferation or by death of responding CD4 lymphocytes induced by HIV transmission from infected Mo in 6-day MLR cultures. Mo from HIV-infected patients retained the ability to stimulate mumps-specific T cell lines in response to antigen, demonstrating that Mo from these individuals could process and display antigen on their cell surface in association with a functional DR molecule. Taken together these results suggest that Mo from HIV-infected patients (i) retain the ability to act as AC in T cell responses to mitogenic signals or to stimulate already activated antigen-specific T cells, but (ii) fail to stimulate resting and/or unprimed T cells in response to alloantigen and perhaps de novo antigen exposure. It is possible this Mo defect may have an adverse effect on the immune responsiveness of HIV-infected individuals.

Although other hCD4-containing chimeras cytotoxic to HIV-infected cells have been developed, there is limited information regarding their receptor binding and internalization. Therefore, the goals of this study were to purify the StxA1-hCD4 fusion protein, identify the receptor(s), and investigate the cytosolic trafficking route used by the chimeric toxin. Sufficient quantities of the StxA1-hCD4 hybrid were isolated for this investigation by using the pET expression and purification system. Cos-1 cells were rendered sensitive to the StxA1-hCD4 chimera by transfection with the env gene, which encodes HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins. The entry and translocation pathway used by the StxA1-hCD4 hybrid toxin was investigated by assessing the protective capacities of chemical reagents which interfere with microfilament movement, acidification of endosomes, and the integrity of the Golgi apparatus. Our findings indicated that the chimera uses HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120, and perhaps gp41, as a receptor which directs its entry through receptor cycling. Uptake is pH independent, and the StxA1-hCD4 hybrid is apparently translocated to the Golgi complex as with other bipartite toxins.

CD80 (B7.1), the ligand of CD28, is an important co-stimulatory molecule on antigen-presenting cells that delivers an essential second signal for T-cell activation. To test whether immunologic dysfunction in HIV disease involves CD80, we studied CD80 expression on circulating monocytes in heparinized whole blood of 33 HIV-infected patients and 13 controls. Most monocytes in patients and controls expressed significant amounts of CD80. There was no statistical difference of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD80 expression when all HIV-infected patients were compared with healthy controls. However, asymptomatic patients in clinical Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stage A showed a significantly stronger CD80 expression than did healthy controls. Additionally, patients receiving antiretroviral therapy exhibited significantly higher CD80 expression than did patients not receiving therapy and healthy controls. We did not find a correlation with the presence of HIV p24 antigenemia and counts of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Although we studied CD80 expression only on circulating monocytes and not in HIV-infected monocytes or in activated macrophages, our data do not support a role for a general impairment of CD80 expression in induction of anergy in HIV disease.

Several factors may influence adherence behavior. This cross-sectional study aimed to highlight socioeconomic predictors of adherence behavior among a cohort of 242 adult Malaysian patients receiving antiretroviral therapy in Hospital Sungai Buloh, Malaysia, where they were enrolled in a parent study (single-blinded randomized controlled trial) between January and December 2014. Statistical analysis of secondary data on adherence behavior and sociodemographic characteristics of the patients revealed mean age of 33.4 years and ranged from 18 to 64 years; 88.8% were males. A total of 224 (93%) patients who completed 6 months' adherence assessment were included in the model. Of these, 135 (60.3%) achieved optimal adherence. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis revealed that patient's income and ethnicity were significant predictors of adherence behavior. This may be valuable for targeted programmatic interventions to further enhance successful treatment outcomes among the target population.

HIV-infected patients in Uganda completed quarterly visits for 1 year, or one visit at 6 months, depending on study randomization. Past month ART non-adherence was less than daily or <100 % on a visual analog scale. Participants were asked if people who take alcohol should stop taking their medications (belief) and whether they occasionally stopped taking their medications in anticipation of drinking (behavior). Visits with self-reported alcohol use and ART use for ≥30 days were included. We used logistic regression to examine correlates of the interactive toxicity belief and behavior, and to determine associations with ART non-adherence. 134 participants contributed 258 study visits. The toxicity belief was endorsed at 24 %, the behavior at 15 %, and any non-adherence at 35 % of visits. In multivariable analysis, the odds of non-adherence were higher for those endorsing the toxicity behavior [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.06; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.97-4.36] but not the toxicity belief (AOR 0.63; 95 % CI 0.32-1.26). Clear messaging about maintaining adherence, even if drinking, could benefit patients.

Decreased odds for UAV were found for both ART use, odds ratio (OR) 0.5 (95% CI 0.4-0.7, P < 0.001) and adherence to ART of > or = 95%, OR 0.6 (95% CI 0.4-0.8, P < 0.001). These relationships persisted in most stratified analysis for both ART use and adherence but in multivariate analysis only for ART use. An undetectable HIV RNA was associated with decreased odds of UAV, OR 0.6 (95% CI 0.5-0.8, P < 0.001). Contrary to expectations, use of and adherence to ART and their consequent suppression of HIV were associated with a decreased prevalence of self-reported risky sexual behavior.

Adherence rates of >/=95% were reported by 66% of the patients. In multivariate analyses, patients with lower rates of adherence tended to be younger (odds ratio [OR], 1.69), to be active drug users (OR, 2.27), to have detectable virus load levels (OR, 2.00), and to have a lower quality of life (OR, 1.20). Among sexually active women, lower adherence rates were associated with an increased risk for inconsistent condom use (adjusted OR, 2.17). Although counseling regarding sexual behavior and adherence to treatment regimens are often addressed separately, our data highlight the importance of discussing these factors in relation to one another, particularly with regard to patients experiencing virologic failure.

A descriptive design was used to examine the relationship between religiosity and ART adherence in a sample of 220 patients attending a HIV/AIDS clinic in a Ugandan public hospital. Participants who self-identified as Pentecostal and Muslim had the highest percentage of members with high religiosity scores and ART adherence. Among Muslim participants (34), 82% reported high religiosity scores and high levels of ART adherence. Of the fifty Pentecostals participants, 96% reported high religiosity scores and 80% reported high levels of ART adherence. Correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between ART adherence and religiosity (r = 0.618, P ≤ 0.01). Therefore, collaboration between religious leaders and HIV/AIDS healthcare providers should be encouraged as one of the strategies for enhancing ART adherence.

AGAS assesses the ease and ability of participants to take antiretroviral therapy according to a health care provider's recommendations. Data were analyzed from completed baseline assessments of the two studies. The AGAS was internally consistent in both samples. Content, construct, and criterion validity were established using factor analysis and correlations of total AGAS scores with two measures of adherence: electronic drug monitoring and an Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group adherence scale. Viral load, CD4 cell counts, and depression scores were also examined. Reliability and validity of the AGAS were supported in both samples.

We have investigated the role of adherence as an activator of HIV-1 transcription and release. The effects of adherence on HIV-1 transcription were examined by using THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line, transfected with HIV long terminal repeat (LTR)-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) constructs. The effects of adherence on release of HIV-1 were investigated in both HIV-1-infected THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Adherence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated THP-1 cells to either tissue culture plastic or endothelial cells was crucial for enhanced HIV-1 transcription as measured by LTR-CAT expression. Such increased LTR-CAT expression did not occur with an HIV LTR construct containing mutated NF-kappa B binding sites. In contrast, release of whole HIV, measured by reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in tissue culture medium, was reduced upon adherence of stimulated HIV-1-infected THP-1 cells without suppression of HIV LTR-CAT transcription or p24 release. This finding suggested that activation of adherent monocytic cells interfered with HIV assembly and release. Although the reduction of RT activity following activation of HIV-1-infected MDM was independent of adhesion, adherence alone of nonstimulated HIV-infected MDM to endothelial cells was sufficient to induce a reduction in RT release. This study demonstrates that LPS stimulation of monocytic cells enhances HIV LTR transcription under adherent conditions. In contrast, activation of adherent monocytic cells infected with HIV reduced viral release.

Adherence is influenced by many behavioural and social factors and incarceration might be one such factor. This study determined the level of adherence and reasons for non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy among 93 HIV-infected prisoners. Up to 56% of these patients had poor adherence. A similar rate of adherence was detected in prisoners after release. Problems with antiretroviral adherence among prisoners appear to be mostly linked to their deviant behaviour. Inmates with poor adherence had higher HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Age and country of origin were also associated with adherence.

To address the burden of HIV/AIDS among this at-risk population, there is need to gain a better understanding of the factors that influence and affect their care-seeking behavior and specifically adherence to antiretroviral treatment. A preliminary qualitative study was conducted with a sample of the target population (n = 10) using grounded theory as the methodological approach. Similarly, 21 healthcare providers - physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and case managers - were then interviewed. A thematic analysis of the transcripts compared care-provider perceptions and narrated experiences with those from the patient participants. Themes related to patient care perceived to enhance medication adherence included (1) provider-patient relationship; (2) holistic and patient-centered care; (3) adequacy of patient education and counseling; (4) modeling adherence behavior; and (5) motivation. Two intervention strategies are proposed - Peer educators as an integral part of the care team and Patient Advisory Groups as a feedback mechanism to enhance effective delivery of patient care in the target population. This exploratory research lays a foundation for the design of targeted interventions to improve linkage to care and enhance medication adherence in African-American women living with HIV/AIDS.

Pulmonary lesions in these patients are characterized by T-lymphocyte alveolitis. Interestingly, HLTV-1-infected cells were markedly increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) obtained from patients with HAM/TSP and those with HTLV-1 uveitis compared to asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers. Furthermore, the proportion of HTLV-1-infected cells was much higher in BALF than in peripheral blood. These results suggest that increased HTLV-1-infected cells play an important role in evolution of T-lymphocyte alveolitis associated with HTLV-1 infection.

The incidence of AIDS was calculated in the general population and examined further according to gender, age (< or = or >49 years), and heterosexual behaviour as a risk factor for HIV. Multivariate analysis was used to identify variables associated with AIDS presenters (defined as patients diagnosed with AIDS within 1 month of the first HIV-positive test). The numbers of patients with AIDS classified as (i) AIDS presenters, (ii) known HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral treatment, and (iii) known HIV-positive patients not receiving antiretroviral treatment were calculated. The overall incidence of AIDS decreased over time, mainly due to the lower number of patients on antiretroviral treatment developing AIDS. Factors associated with a higher risk of being an AIDS presenter were male gender and year of HIV diagnosis. Among patients with AIDS, the proportion of AIDS presenters increased from 13.8% prior to 1997 (when protease inhibitors were introduced in Italy) to 32.5% after 1997. Variables predictive of being an AIDS presenter were male gender, age at diagnosis, and AIDS diagnosis in the years 1997-2000. Heterosexuals had a higher risk of being AIDS presenters and a lower risk of being HIV-positive and not receiving antiretroviral treatment than intravenous drug users. In Italy, AIDS occurs mainly in subjects unaware of their HIV status (especially males, the elderly, and those infected heterosexually) or in patients refusing antiretroviral therapy (mainly intravenous drug users who do not refer to specialised centres).

Conversely, EBV has been rarely associated with encephalitis in HIV patients. Here we describe for the first time the case of an HIV-infected, late presenter Caucasian man, diagnosed with a rapidly progressive diffuse encephalitis at presentation. A very high viral load for EBV was detected in CSF by PCR. The patient died 12 days after the onset of encephalitis in spite of supportive, antiviral and antiretroviral therapy. Our experience would suggest that in profoundly immunosuppressed HIV patients EBV may cause severe encephalitis in the absence of lymphoproliferative disorders.

Clinical and laboratory indices obtained from 161 HIV-seropositive patients who underwent a detailed morphologic and immunophenotypic evaluation of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood cell populations were retrospectively analyzed. In 155 patients, death occurred within the 48-mo follow-up (mean follow-up: 14.8 mo; range: 1 to 48 mo). In the univariate analysis, the patient's age (> 30 yr), HIV disease status, HIV transmission category, number of opportunistic pathogens isolated from the BAL, percentage of BAL neutrophils, and low number of BAL CD4 T cells were predictive of increased mortality. In contrast, the presence of an alveolitis or an increase in the numbers of alveolar macrophages and CD3 T cells was associated with a decreased mortality. In the multivariate analysis, significant independent predictors were age, risk factor for HIV, and presence of an alveolitis. Furthermore, patients with a low number of BAL CD4 T cells had a particularly poor prognosis while the CD4 T-cell count in the peripheral blood (< 50 cells/mm3 in the majority of our patients) had a negligible effect on predicting survival. Our findings suggest the clinical utility of BAL analysis in patients infected with HIV.

From January to August 2009, we assessed the sexual behaviour of HIV-infected patients attending an HIV treatment centre in Uganda and analysed characteristics associated with HIV sero-discordance. Of the 278 respondents, 256 (92.1%) were female, 218 (78.1%) were on antiretroviral drugs and 107 (38.7%) belonged to a sero-discordant couple. In the prior 3 months, 238 (88.5%) had more than one sexual partner and 98 (35.8%) had acquired new sexual partners. Only 171 (61.5%) had ever disclosed sero-status to main sexual partners. Participants who had changed sexual partners in the previous 3 months were more likely to be sero-discordant (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.13, 3.11). Respondents who used condoms during their last sexual intercourse and those currently on ARVs were significantly less likely to be sero-discordant (OR 0.52 95% CI 0.28, 0.96 and OR 0.52 95% CI 0.30, 0.94, respectively). Only disclosure of sero-status was independently though inversely associated with discordance (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20, 0.64). Our findings indicate that HIV patients continue exhibiting high risk behaviour characterised by changing sexual partners, having multiple sexual partners and non-use of condoms.

Increased sexual risk taking has been described in HIV-infected individuals receiving potent antiretroviral therapy. A new questionnaire on sexual behavior was introduced into the Swiss HIV Cohort Study on April 1, 2000. We evaluated sexual behavior in all individuals who completed the questionnaire for the first time within 1 year after its introduction. Our primary hypothesis was that self-reported unsafe sexual behavior would be more prevalent among individuals with optimal viral suppression. On April 1, 2000, 4948 individuals were registered in the study, and 4723 (95%) completed the questionnaire. Of these individuals, 12% reported unsafe sex, 78% received antiretroviral therapy, and 25% had optimal viral suppression (HIV RNA level always <50 copies/mL during the preceding 12 months). During the preceding 6 months, 55% of individuals had stable and 19% had occasional partners, and 6% had both types of partners. Sexual intercourse was reported by 82% of individuals with stable and 87% of individuals with occasional partners, and of those reporting sexual intercourse in each group, 76% and 86%, respectively, said that they always used condoms. After adjustment for covariates, reported unsafe sex was not associated with optimal viral suppression (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.33) or antiretroviral therapy (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.07), but it was associated with gender, age, ethnicity, HIV transmission group, HIV status of partner, having occasional partners, and living alone. There is no evidence that self-reported unsafe sexual behavior is more prevalent among HIV-infected individuals with optimal viral suppression. However, unsafe sex is associated with other factors.

The aim of this cross-sectional study is to determine the prevalence of HBV and HCV infection among HIV individuals; (2) METHODS: A total of 409 patients (126 HBV+ and 283 HCV+) referred to the Brazilian Reference Laboratory for Viral Hepatitis from 2010 to 2013 donated serum samples. Anti-HIV, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs, anti-HBcIgM, anti-HBe, HBeAg, and anti-HCV antibodies were measured, and anti-HCV positive samples were tested for viral RNA and genotype; (3) RESULTS: The anti-HIV antibody prevalence was 10.31% and 4.59% among HBV+ and HCV+ patients, respectively. The HCV mean (SD) viral load was log 5.14 ± 1.64 IU/mL, and genotype I was most prevalent (163/283). Anti-HBs and anti-HBc were detected in 40% and 26% of HCV+ individuals, respectively. Among the HBV+ population, the presence of anti-HIV antibodies was associated with male gender, marital status (married), tattoo, sexual orientation, sexual practices (oral sex and anal sex), history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), history of viral hepatitis treatment, and a sexual partner with hepatitis or HIV. For the HCV+ group, the presence of anti-HIV antibodies was associated with female gender, marital status (married), anal intercourse, previous history of STDs, and number of sexual partners; (4) CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of anti-HIV antibodies was found among individuals with HBV and HCV, showing the importance of education programmes towards HIV infection among HBV- and HCV-infected individuals. 
=> 8th document retrieved: Order: 9503, Title: Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and Host Defense in the Lungs., Abstract: Immunosuppression associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection impacts all components of host defense against pulmonary infection. Cells within the lung have altered immune function and are important reservoirs for HIV infection. The host immune response to infected lung cells further compromises responses to a secondary pathogenic insult. In the upper respiratory tract, mucociliary function is impaired and there are decreased levels of salivary immunoglobulin A. Host defenses in the lower respiratory tract are controlled by alveolar macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. As HIV infection progresses, lung CD4 T cells are reduced in number causing a lack of activation signals from CD4 T cells and impaired defense by macrophages. CD8 T cells, on the other hand, are increased in number and cause lymphocytic alveolitis. Specific antibody responses by B-lymphocytes are decreased and opsonization of microorganisms is impaired. These observed defects in host defense of the respiratory tract explain the susceptibility of HIV-infected persons for oropharyngeal candidiasis, bacterial pneumonia, Pneumocystis pneumonia, and other opportunistic infections.

Both index cases exhibited high levels of anti-HBc IgM antibodies (24.2 and 31.5 S/CO, respectively), suggestive of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, although they had no discernible risk factors for HBV infection, except for chronically HBV-infected spouses with detectable HBV DNA (3.3 log copies/ml [C1S: 72-year-old] and 7.2 log copies/ml [C2S: 71-year-old]). The HBV genotype/subgenotype was identical in each couple (B/B1 or C/C2). The HBV isolates from the index cases and spouses shared a nucleotide sequence identity of 99.5% and 99.7%, respectively, over the entire genome, and these four isolates had the highest nucleotide sequence identity of only 97% to HBV isolates deposited in DNA databases. Phylogenetic trees confirmed a close relationship of the HBV isolates between C1I and C1S and between C2I and C2S, supported by a high bootstrap value of 100% within each couple, indicating the transfer of HBV infection between spouses. These four isolates shared a precore mutation of G1896A known to be associated with fulminant hepatitis B. Although the history of sexual contact within a reasonable incubation period was obscure for one stable, monogamous couple (C1I and C1S), the other couple had a monogamous sexual relationship within six months prior to disease onset. This study indicates that two elderly Japanese patients with fulminant hepatitis B acquired HBV infection via interspousal (most likely sexual) transmission during long-lasting marriages.

The present study assessed the prevalence and risk determinants for hepatitis B, C and D viruses (HBV, HCV and HDV) infections among 102 IDUs from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Serological markers and HCV-RNA were detected by enzyme immunoassay and nested PCR, respectively. HCV genotyping was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP). HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HBs were found in 7.8, 55.8 and 24. 7% of IDUs, respectively. In the final logistic regression, HBV infection was independently associated with male homosexual intercourse within the last 5 years (odds ratio (OR) 3.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-8.8). No subject presented anti-delta (anti-HD). Anti-HCV was detected in 69.6% of subjects, and was found to be independently associated with needle sharing in the last 6 months (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.3-9.2) and with longer duration of iv drug use (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.1-8.7). These data demonstrate that this population is at high risk for both HBV and HCV infection. Among IDUs from Rio de Janeiro, unprotected sexual intercourse seems to be more closely associated with HBV infection, whereas HCV is positively correlated with high risk injecting behavior. Comprehensive public health interventions targeting this population and their sexual partners must be encouraged.

Anti-HCV testing was performed in 1,032 patients and a questionnaire regarding sociodemographic characteristics and potential risk factors was administered. Adjusted prevalence of unique HCV-positive patients using outpatient services was 17.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.2%, 18.2%). The following risk factors were associated with HCV infection: a history of injection drug use (IDU), receipt of blood transfusion prior to 1992, history of tattoo (odds ratio [OR], 2.93; 95% CI, 1.70-5.08), combat job as a medical worker (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.25-5.60), history of incarceration over 48 hours (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.52-4.32), greater than 15 lifetime sexual partners (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.94-2.76) and sexual relations with a prostitute (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.82). We concluded that HCV is common in veterans. Risk factors independently associated with infection are IDU, prior transfusion, prior tattoo, combat medical work, incarceration, and multiple opposite sex partners. Infection with HCV among veterans is strongly associated with traditional risk factors for infection and less strongly associated with combat-related risk.

Among 128 patients with various diagnoses, 23 (18%) were positive for HIV-2 by ELISA and Western blot. One of these patients was serologically reactive for HIV-1 also, but PCR and viral culture revealed the presence of HIV-2 only. To study risk factors, behaviors, and AIDS knowledge related to the acquisition of HIV infection, 22 HIV-2-seropositive and 21 seronegative hospitalized patients were given a physical examination and administered a questionnaire. Among women, transfusion was associated with HIV-2 infection (OR = 14.4, p = 0.02); among men, sex with a prostitute was the principal risk factor (OR = undefined, p = 0.02). Although 79% of HIV-infected patients and controls had heard of AIDS, only 17% of all study participants and 50% of males reporting sex with prostitutes had used condoms in the previous year. These data suggest that the risk factors for HIV-2 infection are similar to those for HIV-1 and support previous studies showing that HIV-2 is the predominant HIV in Guinea-Bissau. Efforts to decrease transmission of HIV-2 should include screening for HIV-2 in blood for transfusion in endemic areas (now done in Bissau) and education about the risk of sexual transmission.

Two students were seropositive (0.06%, 95% confidence interval 0-0.15%). Both were homosexual men with multiple sexual partners. Despite the low prevalence of infection, potential risk factors for transmission of HIV-1 were common, as assessed by a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. These included a previous sexually transmitted disease (12.6%), male homosexual intercourse (4.8% of men), heterosexual anal intercourse (25.3%), heterosexual intercourse with a person at risk (an HIV-1 infected person, a bisexual man, a parenteral drug user, a female prostitute, or a hemophiliac) (5.2%), multiple sexual partners (21% reported 10 or more lifetime partners), and intravenous drug use (1.3%). Assessment of the efficacy of our program by comparing responses on pre- and post-test questionnaires showed gains in knowledge about heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 and an increase in the reported frequency of condom use 1-2 months after participating in the survey. The authors conclude that HIV-1 infections are occurring among college students but in our study group remain confined to persons with known high-risk behavior; however, practices that may support transmission are common, and programs designed to diminish these behaviors among college students are needed.

Military personnel are one of many core populations at increased risk for acquiring STDs. This study was designed to assess primary care physician/practitioner compliance with secondary screening recommendations and reporting practices of STDs in a military setting. Data from approximately 27,000 covered lives from the Naval Hospital and the Naval Air Station Branch Medical Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, were used in this analysis. Because chlamydia is the most prevalent STD, laboratory results indicative of infection with chlamydia from July 1 to December 31, 1996, were used as a marker of a patient population requiring additional (secondary) STD screening. Patients with laboratory-confirmed chlamydia infection were identified using the Composite Health Care System. The medical records of these index cases were then analyzed for the presence of laboratory test results of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), rapid plasma reagin, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) within 6 months of a positive chlamydia test. To assess compliance with mandated reporting of particular STDs, total laboratory-confirmed cases of chlamydia, syphilis, and HBV were compared with total cases reported to the Office of Preventive Medicine at the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, U.S. Navy, during a 1-year period from July 1, 1996, to June 30, 1997. In 32% of chlamydia cases, no additional laboratory tests for HIV, syphilis, or HBV were obtained within 6 months. Fourteen percent of chlamydia cases were reported to the Office of preventive Medicine. Compliance with screening for multiple STDs after the identification of a single STD should be improved. In addition, better methods for reporting cases of STDs should be implemented.

Nowadays, the treatment of choice for chronic hepatitis due to HCV infection in HIV-positive patients is pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. This combination achieves an overall cure rate of 50%, which is somewhat lower than those obtained in patients with HCV monoinfection. Adverse effects are frequent, leading to treatment withdrawal in 10-20% of patients. Importantly, there are three new features of hepatitis C in patients with HIV: (1) the recent development of epidemic outbreaks of acute hepatitis due to HCV infection in HIV-positive men caused by homosexual activity, (2) pharmacogenetic markers in the form of genetic polymorphisms near the IL28B gene related to response to HCV treatment as well as spontaneous eradication of HCV after acute infection, and (3) new antiviral molecules have allowed triple combination treatments to be designed and the preliminary results of clinical trials reporting high response rates are highly promising.

These three pathologic conditions are associated with an increased prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this multidisciplinary clinical review, we aim to discuss the ever-expanding wealth of clinical and epidemiological evidence supporting a key role of fatty liver in the development of T2D and CVD in patients with NAFLD and in those with HCV or HIV infections. For each of these three common diseases, the epidemiological features, pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical implications of the presence of fatty liver in predicting the risk of incident T2D and CVD are examined in depth. Collectively, the data discussed in this updated review, which follows an innovative comparative approach, further reinforce the conclusion that the presence of fatty/inflamed/fibrotic liver might be a shared important determinant for the development of T2D and CVD in patients with NAFLD, HCV or HIV. This review may also open new avenues in the clinical and research arenas and paves the way for the planning of future, well-designed prospective and intervention studies.

Intermittent adherence to antiretroviral regimens, however, has been associated with the selection of HIV mutations, resulting in drug-resistant virus. Medication compliance has become a vital component in the care of HIV-infected patients. This study was designed to assess the degree of medication compliance with zidovudine (ZDV) over a 2-month period among a convenience sample of 23 ambulatory patients with HIV infection. Enrollment took place during February to March 1995, when monotherapy with ZDV was considered the standard of care. Medication compliance was assessed by three methods: patient self-report determined by questionnaire, pharmacy refill records from the 3 months immediately before entry in the study, and an electronic monitoring system (Medication Event Management Systems [MEMS], Aprex Corp., Fremont, CA), which records the date and time of each opening of the medication vials. MEMS was utilized among a subgroup of eight participants over a 2-month period. Despite greater than 95% (22 of 23) of the subjects reporting that they believed ZDV was life prolonging, a majority took < or = 75% of the prescribed doses of ZDV as identified by both refill and MEMS methods. The mean percentage compliance over a 2-month period of observation for MEMS and pharmacy refill record review methods was 66% and 78%, respectively (p = 0.294). Among the subgroup of eight in the MEMS evaluation, 88% reported taking their ZDV according to the directions, all of the time. These results demonstrate that reliance upon patient self-report of medication compliance is less accurate than MEMS or pharmacy refill records, and that reliance on self-reporting could lead to erroneous assumptions of the patient's true drug compliance. In addition, the study suggests that pharmacy refill records may provide a method of assessing compliance that is equivalent to MEMS but is less experimental, and can easily be followed and interpreted by pharmacists and other clinicians caring for patients infected with HIV. Most importantly, relatively poor compliance rates demonstrated by MEMS raises serious concern for widespread development of HIV resistance to the more complicated, multiple-drug regimens in present use.

Electronic interventions could aid in dissemination of interventions in the clinic setting. This study developed and tested the feasibility and acceptability of a computer-based adaption of an empirically supported face-to-face adherence promotion intervention. HIV-positive individuals (N = 92) on antiretroviral therapy with self-reported adherence <95% were randomized to the electronic intervention + treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU only. Study outcome variables which included treatment self-efficacy and self-reported medication adherence were assessed at baseline and follow-up. Time × condition interaction effects in mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVAs) examined the differences in patterns of change in the outcome variables over time between the two groups. Participants in the electronic intervention condition reported higher levels of self-efficacy to adhere to their medication at follow-up compared to the control condition. Although nonsignificant, levels of adherence tended to improve over time in the intervention condition, while TAU adherence remained constant. This was the first study to investigate a single-session, computer-based adherence intervention. Results suggest that electronic interventions are feasible and this method may be effective at increasing self-efficacy and adherence among patients reporting suboptimal adherence levels.

Many patients in community clinical settings have imperfect adherence that may lead to poor clinical outcomes. The Connecticut HIV Medication Project (CHaMP) is a multidisciplinary program designed to evaluate patients receiving antiviral therapy. Based on results of a multifaceted assessment, a variety of targeted interventions and follow-up are offered. A retrospective analysis was performed on patients who were referred to the program over a 35-month period from March 2002 through January 2005. Two hundred forty-nine patients who were referred for adherence services had baseline and follow-up data available for analysis. Participants who maintained an unchanged antiretroviral regimen experienced a significant increase in self-reported adherence (89.1% to 96.9%, p < 0.001) and likelihood of reporting more than 95% adherence (36.6% to 73.1%, p < 0.001) by 7-day recall. Improvements in plasma HIV viremia (3.10 +/- 1.21 log copies to 2.78 +/- 0.98, p < 0.01) were also demonstrated. Limitations to this study included the unusually high level of baseline adherence, the large fraction of patients (28.6%) who were lost to follow-up, and follow-up that was limited to one time point at 12-16 weeks such that attrition of the intervention effect could not be assessed. The CHaMP experience demonstrates that the development of a multifaceted clinical program can have significant impact on medication adherence and viral burden in HIV infection.

Transmission of HCV is primarily via parenteral blood exposure, and HCV can be transmitted vertically from mother to child. Vertical transmission occurs in 5.8% (95% confidence interval = 4.2%-7.8%) of infants born to women who are infected only with HCV and in up to twice as many infants born to women who are also infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (2) or who have high HCV viral loads (3,4); there is currently no recommended intervention to prevent transmission of infection from mother to child (3). Increased reported incidence of HCV infection among persons aged ≤30 years (5,6) with similar increases among women and men in this age group (6), raises concern about increases in the number of pregnant women with HCV infection, and in the number of infants who could be exposed to HCV at birth. Data from one large commercial laboratory and birth certificate data were used to investigate trends in HCV detection among women of childbearing age,* HCV testing among children aged ≤2 years, and the proportions of infants born to HCV-infected women nationally and in Kentucky, the state with the highest incidence of acute HCV infection during 2011-2014 (6). During 2011-2014, commercial laboratory data indicated that national rates of HCV detection (antibody or RNA positivity(†)) among women of childbearing age increased 22%, and HCV testing (antibody or RNA) among children aged ≤2 years increased 14%; birth certificate data indicated that the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected mothers increased 68%, from 0.19% to 0.32%. During the same time in Kentucky, the HCV detection rate among women of childbearing age increased >200%, HCV testing among children aged ≤2 years increased 151%, and the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected women increased 124%, from 0.71% to 1.59%. Increases in the rate of HCV detection among women of childbearing age suggest a potential risk for vertical transmission of HCV. These findings highlight the importance of following current CDC recommendations to identify, counsel, and test persons at risk for HCV infection (1,7), including pregnant women, as well as consider developing public health policies for routine HCV testing of pregnant women, and expanding current policies for testing and monitoring children born to HCV-infected women. Expansion of HCV reporting and surveillance requirements will enhance case identification and prevention strategies.

Six patients infected with HIV presented with proximal muscle weakness, biochemical and electromyographic abnormalities consistent with myositis. One patient had a skin rash characteristic of dermatomyositis. Muscle biopsy findings demonstrated the presence of an inflammatory cell infiltrate and HIV-p24 antigen. All patients developed their clinical picture prior to AZT therapy and responded to steroids with or without coadministration of AZT.

We present two patients with pseudobulbar syndrome and HIV infection, with no clinical or electromyographic signs of lower motor neuron loss. In patient 1, on follow-up, focal seizures led to additional investigations that identified unsuspected HIV infection and progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML). In patient 2, all investigations excluded an active HIV infection or central nervous system involvement, and the disease progression made primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) with pseudobulbar onset the most likely diagnosis. ALS-like syndrome can occur in association with HIV infection; however, the causal relationship remains uncertain. Patient 1 shows that PML is a possible cause for pseudobulbar syndrome, and our second patient demonstrates that ALS may also occur by chance in patients with HIV infection.

To evaluate gender equity in ART access among adults (defined for this report as persons aged ≥15 years), 765,087 adult ART patient medical records from 12 countries in five geographic regions* were analyzed to estimate the ratio of women to men among new ART enrollees for each calendar year during 2002-2013. This annual ratio was compared with estimates from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)(†) of the ratio of HIV-infected adult women to men in the general population. In all 10 African countries and Haiti, the most recent estimates of the ratio of adult women to men among new ART enrollees significantly exceeded the UNAIDS estimates for the female-to-male ratio among HIV-infected adults by 23%-83%. In six African countries and Haiti, the ratio of women to men among new adult ART enrollees increased more sharply over time than the estimated UNAIDS female-to-male ratio among adults with HIV in the general population. Increased ART coverage among men is needed to decrease their morbidity and mortality and to reduce HIV incidence among their sexual partners. Reaching more men with HIV testing and linkage-to-care services and adoption of test-and-treat ART eligibility guidelines (i.e., regular testing of adults, and offering treatment to all infected persons with ART, regardless of CD4 cell test results) could reduce gender inequity in ART coverage.

Viral quasispecies characteristics are associated with its pathogenic properties. For hepatitis B virus (HBV), its core region is the main immune recognition region for its enriched epitopes. In our study, we discuss the quasispecies characteristics and positive selection within core gene within chronic HBV infected child and adult patients. By analyzing 170 core gene sequences from child CHB patients and 121 core genes sequences from adult CHB patients, quasispecies characteristics were described by sequence complexity, diversity, non-synonymous substitution ratio (dN) and synonymous substitution ratios (dS). In addition, positive selection sites were also determined by bioinformatics tools. Then, all these parameters were compared between child and adult CHB patient groups. Compared with child patients, adult patients with CHB showed distinct quasispecies characteristics within the core region, had a higher sequence complexity and diversity and more positive selection sites, suggesting that the adult CHB patients had a higher immune selection pressure on the HBV core gene. Reduced selection pressure on the HBV core gene in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB patients than HBeAg negative CHB patients were observed in both adult and child patient groups. The majority of the screened positive selection sites lay within human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-restricted epitopes. In conclusion, this study analyzed the quasispecies characteristics discrepancy between child and adult patients with CHB, and revealed the possible reason for the distinct clinical characteristics in the perspective of population genetics.

The diagnosis was made at autopsy and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) was identified in tumour cells by in situ hybridization. Review of the literature revealed 13 cases of visceral myogenic tumours occurring in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome children, and only 2 cases in adults. One was a spinal epidural leiomyoma, the other multiple smooth muscle tumours of the colon and adrenal gland. This is the first report of EBV in smooth muscle neoplastic cells in an HIV-infected adult patient.

Although most of HTLV1-infected individuals remain asymptomatic carriers, 1% to 5% and 3% to 5% develop adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, respectively. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HTLV1 infection in hemodialysis patients in Sari and Ghaemshahr. This cross-sectional study was conducted on160 patients using random samples selection, and included 80 men and 80 women (mean age, 59.1 &plusmn; 14.7 years). All the samples were screened for HTLV1 antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and positive samples were confirmed by Western blot assay. Only 1 patient had a positive anti-HTLV1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, which was confirmed by Western blot. The overall prevalence of HTLV1 seropositivity was 0.6%. The patient was a 21-year-old woman with a history of multiple blood transfusions. She had a history of unsuccessful kidney transplantation and had been on hemodialysis before transplant, too. This study suggests that HTLV1 infection may not be prevalent in high-risk patients in Mazandaran province, and there is no need for HTLV1 screening of blood samples.

Seventy-seven HIV-1-positive patients were asked to answer the validated questionnaire of the European preliminary criteria for the classification of Sjögren's syndrome on oral and ocular sicca symptoms. Twenty-six patients gave one positive answer to both ocular and oral symptoms, and of these 14 (hepatitis C virus negative) consented to participate in the study (patients group). Ten age- and sex-matched HIV-1-positive patients with a negative questionnaire constituted the control group. Patients and controls had: (a) Schirmer's test and slit-lamp examination after Rose Bengal staining; (b) parotid gland scanning with technetium; (c) detection of autoantibodies in sera to Ro/SSA and La/SSB; (d) labial salivary gland biopsy (patients group only). The control group gave negative parotid gland scanning and only one gave a positive Rose Bengal staining test. In the patients group, parotid gland enlargement was manifested by three patients and only one gave positive Rose Bengal staining test. Six out of the 14 patients had biopsies identical with Sjögren's syndrome and five of these gave positive parotid gland scanning. In the biopsies of four other patients, mucoid degeneration of the stroma was found. Immunopathology revealed that the predominant cells were T cells with the CD8 phenotype. None of the patient and control sera had autoantibodies to Ro/SSA and La/SSB, whereas all patients had hypergammaglobulinaemia. The overall prevalence of possible SLS in a mixed population of HIV(+) patients (88.3% men and 11.7% women) was 7.79% which is >2.5 times higher than that observed in normal Greek adult females.

However, this decrease was less marked in asymptomatic patients; in fact, the percentage and number of the above cells in this group of subjects was significantly higher than in the AIDS patients (Student's t-test, p < 0.05). However, we failed to find significant differences in the percentage of natural killer cells (NKCs; CD15 ( + ) CD56 ( + ) ) between the HIV-1-infected asymptomatic or AIDS groups of patients, or when compared with the controls (mean +/- SD of 10.4% +/- 9.4%, 14.3% +/- 9.7%, and 14.8% +/- 6.4%, respectively). Whereas either group of patients had a lower number of NKCs per microliter than the control group (mean +/- SD of 137.8 +/- 87.6, 91.1 +/- 98.3, and 331. 5 +/- 266.5, respectively), this decrease only reached statistical significance for the AIDS patients (Student's t-test, p < 0.05). Healthy controls showed statistically significantly higher NKC activity than either the HIV-1-infected asymptomatic or AIDS group of patients (K-562 target cell; mean +/- SD and range values as percentage of specific lysis of 19.1% +/- 15.6% and 2.4%-58.2%, 3.4% +/- 3.2% and less than 0.1% [non-detectable]-10.3%, and 6.4% +/- 5. 5% and less than 0.1%-19.5%, respectively; Student's t-test, p < 0. 05). Challenge of samples from the control group with either interleukin-2, alpha-interferon, or with a mixture of the calcium ionophore A23187 (Io) plus the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ester (TPA) resulted in every case in a statistically significant increase in NKC lytic function (mean +/- SD and range values as percentage of specific lysis of 19.1% +/- 15.6% and 2.4%-58.2%, 27. 6% +/- 17.4% and less than 0.1%-56.0%, 32.1% +/- 20.9% and 2.1%-76. 4%, and 62.6% +/- 24.0% and 16.7%-95.0%, respectively; Student's t-test, p < 0.05). A similar challenge for samples from the HIV-1-positive subjects, either asymptomatic or with AIDS, resulted in most cases in an enhanced NKC activity; however, this increase in NKC lytic function reached statistical significance only for the group of Io + TPA-incubated samples (Student's t-test, p < 0.05). These results indicate that control or patient baseline NKC activity, and the response of this cellular immune function to a challenge with different immunomodulators, are phenotype-independent. They also suggest an association between HIV-1 infection and alterations in the initial mechanisms responsible for NKC activation; a similar general explanation has been suggested to account for the abnormal NKC lytic function observed in various severe pathological conditions, e.g., extensive burns, polytrauma, and sepsis. Understanding the molecular mechanism involved in regulating initial NKC activation could provide the rational basis for the design of newer pharmacological strategies to treat these conditions.

Children of adult antiretroviral therapy (ART) patients are a target group for HIV testing in order to increase access to care, but the HIV test coverage of this group in Malawi is unknown. In a cross-sectional survey of 832 patients at a large urban ART clinic in Blantyre, we found that 81.2% of 1223 children and 37.7% of 488 spouses of adult ART patients were reportedly not HIV tested. Wives of male patients were significantly less frequently HIV tested than husbands of female patients (53.0% vs. 72.4%, p<0.0001). Children under the age of 8 years (adjusted odds ratios [aOR] 2.76), children of female patients (aOR 2.53) and of patients whose partner had been HIV tested (aOR 2.87) were significantly more likely to have been tested for HIV. More attention needs to be given to provider initiated testing of children and spouses of ART patients.

Childhood abuse history has been associated with worse antiretroviral adherence and negative health behaviours in HIV-infected patients. This study evaluates the relationship between childhood abuse and the timing of presentation for HIV care. Participants in a multi-center prospective cohort study, who established initial HIV care after January 1996 and had a CD4 count available within six months of initial presentation, were included in this analysis. Bivariate contingency tables and multivariate logistic regression were used to evaluate the association of childhood abuse with early presentation for HIV care (initial CD4 count > or =200/mm3). Among the 186 subjects included in this analysis, 33% had childhood abuse histories and 58% had an initial CD4 count > or =200/mm3. Participants with a history of childhood abuse were more likely to present early for HIV care (AOR=2.12; p=0.03), perhaps because survivors of abuse tend to have higher utilization of health services. Because HIV-infected patients with childhood abuse histories have worse antiretroviral medication adherence and are more likely to engage in high-risk sexual and injection drug use behaviours, early presentation affords clinicians the opportunity for timely institution of interventions that may improve patient outcomes and prevent secondary HIV infections.

Data were obtained from the Housing and Health Study of participants living in Baltimore, Chicago, and Los Angeles (n = 644). We used logistic regression to identify risks associated with abuse. About 77% of men and 86% of women reported ever experiencing abuse. Women were at greater risk than men for intimate partner physical abuse, childhood sexual abuse (CSA), and adulthood sexual abuse. Men and women experiencing intimate partner physical abuse reported increased risk of unprotected sex. Other risks associated with abuse include sex exchange; lifetime alcohol abuse; and depressive symptoms. Abuse prevalence among sample exceeds those found in other samples of general USA, HIV-seropositive, and homeless populations. Identifying persons at risk of abuse is needed to reduce risk among homeless or unstably housed persons living with HIV.

Of the 95, 95% did not have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and were largely asymptomatic; 61.1% had clinical axis I diagnoses, which included simple phobia, adjustment disorders, hypoactive sexual desire disorder, alcohol use disorder, major depression, and organic mental disorders; 30.5% had personality disorders. Significantly higher frequencies (p less than 0.05) of simple phobia and hypoactive sexual desire disorder were noted with knowledge of HIV seropositivity. Disorders that occurred more commonly than in age-matched Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) participants included: simple phobia, antisocial personality disorder, alcohol abuse, and organic mental disorders. The high prevalence of major psychiatric illness in this sample supports the notion that screening for psychiatric illness, and counseling where indicated, should be integral to HIV screening programs.

Retrospective quantitative data are presented from HIV-infected pregnant women (n = 45) who reported childhood sexual or physical abuse (66%), abuse in adulthood by a sexual partner (25%), and abuse during pregnancy (10%). Depression and anxiety were the most commonly reported psychological symptoms; more than half of the sample reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including HIV-related PTSD (PTSD-HIV). There was a strong association between depression and PTSD as well as between anxiety and PTSD-HIV. The majority of infants received zidovudine at birth and continued the recommended regimen. All but one infant were determined to be noninfected. Women improved their CD4(+) T cell counts and HIV RNA viral loads while in prenatal care. Results support the need for targeted prenatal programs to address depression, anxiety, substance use, and trauma in HIV-infected women.

Initial complaints or diagnoses for these children included the following: hematologic disorders (5) (3 idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, 1 neutropenia, 1 anemia); recurrent bacterial infections (10); Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (3); developmental delay (1); skin disorders (2) (1 genital wart, 1 chronic zoster); weight loss (3); malignancy (1); and nephropathy (1). Eight children were referred for evaluation because of maternal HIV-1 infection. The risk factors for HIV-1 infection included maternal/perinatal exposure (22), perinatal blood transfusion (6), blood transfusion during infancy (2), and sexual abuse (2). Ten (31%) of the 32 children have subsequently died. The longest survival from perinatal infection was 12 years. HIV-1 infection in children can result in a prolonged clinical latency and can masquerade as other pathologic conditions. The absence of clinical symptoms in older children at risk for HIV-1 infection should not deter HIV testing.

Increased sexual risk taking has been described in HIV-infected individuals receiving potent antiretroviral therapy. A new questionnaire on sexual behavior was introduced into the Swiss HIV Cohort Study on April 1, 2000. We evaluated sexual behavior in all individuals who completed the questionnaire for the first time within 1 year after its introduction. Our primary hypothesis was that self-reported unsafe sexual behavior would be more prevalent among individuals with optimal viral suppression. On April 1, 2000, 4948 individuals were registered in the study, and 4723 (95%) completed the questionnaire. Of these individuals, 12% reported unsafe sex, 78% received antiretroviral therapy, and 25% had optimal viral suppression (HIV RNA level always <50 copies/mL during the preceding 12 months). During the preceding 6 months, 55% of individuals had stable and 19% had occasional partners, and 6% had both types of partners. Sexual intercourse was reported by 82% of individuals with stable and 87% of individuals with occasional partners, and of those reporting sexual intercourse in each group, 76% and 86%, respectively, said that they always used condoms. After adjustment for covariates, reported unsafe sex was not associated with optimal viral suppression (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.33) or antiretroviral therapy (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.07), but it was associated with gender, age, ethnicity, HIV transmission group, HIV status of partner, having occasional partners, and living alone. There is no evidence that self-reported unsafe sexual behavior is more prevalent among HIV-infected individuals with optimal viral suppression. However, unsafe sex is associated with other factors.

Overall prevalence was anti-HIV, 0.34%; anti-HBc, 11.1%; HBsAg, 2.4%; anti-HCV, 6.4%; HTLV, 1.09%; and syphilis, 3.4%. The majority (86.3%) reported a history of sexual activity; 27% had never used condoms. Girls also reported previous pregnancy (35%), abortion (26%) and sexual abuse (74%). Many youth reported a family history of alcohol abuse (56%), illicit drug use (24.7%), or legal problems (38%). Serological results show that youth in Salvador are at high risk for blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections. Policies to reduce the risk and impact of these infections should be a requisite part of health care for incarcerated youth.

It has been suggested that the increased incidence of AVN in this population may be caused by an increased prevalence of predisposing factors for osteonecrosis, including protease inhibitors, hyperlipidemia, corticosteroid use, alcohol and intravenous drug abuse. The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors for avascular necrosis developing in the femoral head of HIV infected individuals. This study consisted of meta-analysis of the secondary data extracted from current literature. The selected articles allowed two study groups to be drawn up for comparison. Group 1 comprised 324 individuals infected by the HIV virus, who did not present femoral head AVN. Group 2 comprised 32 HIV positive patients, who presented femoral head AVN. The parameters used for analysis were as follows: age, gender, sexual preference, use of intravenous drugs, time of diagnosis, CD4+ cell count, use of antiretroviral agents and duration, serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides. The present study found a statistically significant association between hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, sexual preference and intravenous drug abuse. The authors concluded that femoral head osteonecrosis is associated with hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia) and intravenous drug abuse. This study supports the hypothesis that protease inhibitors play a role in the development of osteonecrosis through a tendency to cause hyperlipidemia.

In contrast to many countries in the Western world, most of the heroin addicts in Israel do not inject. This study attempts to clarify the link between the pattern of drug abuse and seroprevalence for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among volunteers attending a detoxification clinic in Jerusalem. Three hundred heroin abusers were interviewed about their drug habits and sexual preference. In addition, all participants underwent HIV serological testing. The majority of them took heroin by smoking, with only 19% injecting the drug. None of the participants in the study were HIV seropositive. An association is seen between the pattern of illicit drug use in Israel and the low incidence of AIDS in this country.

Therefore, changes in incidence, risk factors, and circulating genotypes over time were determined among drug users in Amsterdam over an 18-year period (1985-2002). Sera of 1,268 drug users, both injecting and non-injecting, were screened for anti-HBc. HBV genotypes of the anti-HBc seroconverters were determined. Poisson regression was used to test for temporal trends in incidence and to identify risk factors for seroconversion. Of the 598 participants who were anti-HBc negative at entry, 83 seroconverted for anti-HBc. The incidence of HBV declined from 5.9/100 Person Years up to 1993 to 0/100 Person Years in 2002. Of the drug users infected acutely, both injecting and non-injecting, 88% were infected with the same genotype D, serotype ayw3 strain. Multivariate analyses revealed current injecting, age, and calendar year of visit as independent risk factors. The decline in the incidence of HBV among drug users in Amsterdam is probably caused by a decline in injecting behavior. Injecting and non-injecting drug users were infected with the same strain, indicating that drug users infect one another, regardless of their risk behavior. After 2000, no injecting drug users with an acute HBV infection were reported to the Public Health Service Amsterdam and the specific genotype D strain had disappeared. These findings suggest that drug users may no longer be a high-risk group for HBV infection in Amsterdam. However, trends in drug use need to be monitored.

However, differences between new and longer-term injecting drug users (IDUs) have not received as much attention. This study examined injecting initiation experience, risk and risk reduction practices, and self-reported HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing practices and infection among new (injecting < or =4 years) and longer-term IDUs. Data from 3 cross-sectional surveys in 1992, 1994, and 1997 of syringe exchange program (SEP) users in Oslo, Norway, were used. Approximately one fifth of IDUs were new injectors. New IDUs were increasingly indistinguishable from longer-term IDUs in terms of socio-demographics, risk practices, and HIV and HCV testing. The prevalence of HIV infection remained low (5%); in contrast, approximately two thirds of all SEP users reported being HCV-infected. Known HCV infection status had no impact on syringe sharing; most HCV-infected SEP users reported sharing syringes, regardless of the duration of injecting. The only variable associated with HCV infection was injecting < or =4 years (adjusted odds ratio = 0.2; 95% confidence interval = 0.1-0.4). Increased similarity in age between new and longer-term IDUs may have contributed to the rapid spread of HCV infection by facilitating mixing patterns between HCV-infected and -susceptible IDUs.

Association with drug injection patterns., Abstract: To investigate the epidemiology of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among injecting drug users, the authors assessed the prevalence of HBV seromarkers among 2,558 injecting drug users recruited through street outreach in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1988-1989. Eighty percent of the drug users had at least one HBV seromarker. HBV seropositivity was associated with increasing age, duration of injecting drug use, African-American ethnicity, injecting drugs at least once daily, and sharing needles or visiting "shooting galleries" during the previous 11 years, but not with high-risk sexual behaviors or a history of sexually transmitted disease. This finding is possibly due to the relative inefficiency of sexual transmission as compared with parenteral transmission in injecting drug users. In addition, HBV seropositivity was strongly associated with seropositivity for hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus. The authors conclude that HBV transmission among injecting drug users occurs primarily through the sharing of contaminated drug injecting equipment rather than through sexual relations, and that efforts to prevent HBV infection must target injecting drug users early in their injecting careers.

The goal of our study was to assess HIV infection, risk perceptions and injecting equipment sharing among IDUs in Budapest, Hungary. Altogether 150 IDUs were interviewed (121 structured interviews between 1999 and 2000 and 29 ethnographic interviews between 2003 and 2004). The majority of them injected heroin (52% and 79%) and many injected amphetamines (51% and 35%). One person tested positive for HIV. Two thirds (68%) shared injecting equipment (syringes, cookers and filters). Some participants said they shared syringes because they were not carrying them for fear of police harassment and that they reused filters as a backup drug supply. In multivariate analysis, sharing of injecting equipment was associated with higher perceived susceptibility to HIV/AIDS, lower self-efficacy for sterile equipment use, higher motivation to comply with peer pressure to use dirty injecting equipment and with having a criminal record. The high levels of injecting risk-behaviors found in this study are a cause for serious concern. Interventions for HIV-prevention need to address not only sharing syringes but also sharing and reusing of other injecting equipment and drug filters.

This is believed to be the first study that directly compared changes in T-lymphocyte subsets following HIV-1 seroconversion between cohorts of predominantly black injecting drug users and predominantly white homosexual men. Longitudinal trends of CD4 and CD8 percentages of total lymphocytes during 4 years were modeled as piecewise linear functions with a two-parameter correlation structure to accommodate within-person repeated observations. Prior to seroconversion the 151 injecting drug users started with similar CD4% and CD8% levels compared with the 99 homosexual men. Following seroconversion, larger changes were observed overall in the homosexual men compared with the injecting drug users for both markers (p < or = 0.001). The major discrepancies, however, were limited to the first 2 years. Subsequently, the CD4% levels of the two cohorts converged and then declined at similar rates. These comparative analyses of HIV seroconverters in homosexual men and injecting drug users suggest that risk group has only a minor effect on the initial course of HIV infection.

We examined the prevalence and covariates of injecting drug use among men participating in the Sydney Gay Community Periodic Survey between 2004-06 and 2011. In 2004-06, data was collected about which drugs were injected, while in 2011, data was collected about hepatitis C (HCV) and esoteric sexual practices. In 2004-06, 5.6 % of men reported injecting drugs in the previous 6 months; 3.4 % reported methamphetamine injection and 0.4 % heroin injection. In 2011, men who injected drugs were less likely to be employed full-time, and more likely to be HCV-positive, HIV-positive, to have used party drugs for sex, and to have engaged in esoteric sexual practices. The strong associations between injecting drug use, sexual risk practices and blood-borne virus infection suggests the need for combined sexual health and harm reduction services for gay and bisexual men who inject drugs.

The prevalence estimates vary widely among studies and may be influenced by the presence or absence of antiretroviral therapy and lipodystrophy, severity of HIV disease, and overlapping bone loss risk factors. Addressing potential underlying bone disease risk factors (e.g., smoking and alcohol intake), evaluating calcium and vitamin D intake, and performing dual x-ray absorptiometry in patients with HIV who have risks for bone disease are important strategies in preventing osteopenia and osteoporosis in HIV-infected patients. Management of osteopenia and osteoporosis is still being evaluated.

The prevalence estimates vary widely among the different studies and can be affected by concomitant factors such as the overlapping of other possible conditions inducing bone loss as lypodystrophy, advanced HIV-disease, advanced age, low body weight or concomitant use of other drugs. All the reports at the moment available in the literature showed a higher than expected prevalence of reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV-infected subjects both naïve and receiving potent antiretroviral therapy compared to healthy controls. This controversial can suggest a double role played by both antiretroviral drugs and HIV itself due to immune activation and/or cytokines disregulation. An improved understanding of the pathogenesis of bone disorders can result in better preventative and therapeutic measures. However, the clinical relevance and the risk of fractures remains undefined in HIV-population. The clinical management of osteopenia and osteoporosis in HIV-infected subjects is still being evaluated. Addressing potential underlying bone disease risk factors (e.g., smoking and alcohol intake, use of corticosteroids, advanced age, low body weight), evaluating calcium and vitamin D intake, and performing dual x-ray absorptiometry in HIV-infected individuals who have risk factors for bone disease can be important strategies to prevent osteopenia and osteoporosis in this population. The administration of bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate), with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, may be a reasonable and effective option to treat osteoporosis in these subjects.

Morphology and clinical correlation., Abstract: To determine the true incidence of abnormalities in bone marrow specimens from patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the clinical significance of these abnormalities regarding their cause and their role in the production of hematologic complications, 216 bone marrow biopsies, aspirates, and/or imprint preparations from 178 patients who either were seropositive for HIV infection or met the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were studied. Detailed morphologic review was performed in a blind fashion as to clinical status. Extensive clinical, therapeutic, and laboratory data were collected for each patient. Statistical analysis was performed to detect significant correlations between morphologic findings and clinical/therapeutic/laboratory features. Among the most common bone marrow findings were hypercellularity (53% of specimens), myelodysplasia (69%), evidence of reticuloendothelial (RE) iron blockade (65%), megaloblastic hematopoiesis (38%), fibrosis (20%), plasmacytosis (25%), lymphocytic aggregates (36%), and granulomas (13%). A number of statistically significant correlations between morphologic findings and clinical features were noted. No significant association was detected between any morphologic finding and therapy with a variety of drugs. In 7 of 14 (50%) patients found to have marrow involvement by malignant neoplasm, the bone marrow represented the initial site of diagnosis of the neoplasm. Most of the bone marrow abnormalities associated with HIV infection appear to be related directly to the infection or its complications and not to therapeutic intervention. In certain clinical situations, bone marrow examination continues to be useful in the management of patients infected with HIV.

A case control study., Abstract: Summary - In the last few years, the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy has radically modified the prognosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Osteonecrosis and osteoporosis are among the bone complications recently described in HIV-infected patients. We report a preliminary study comparing 47 HIV-infected patients (31 men and 16 women) to 47 age- and sex-matched controls. Bone mineral density was lower in patients than in controls: in men, 0.919 +/- 0.120 g/cm2 vs. 1.010 +/- 0.139 g/cm2 (P = 0.01) at the total hip and 0.948 +/- 0.100 g/cm2 vs. 1.043 +/- 0.117 g/cm2 (P = 0.0008) at the lumbar spine; in women, 0.912 +/- 0.149 g/cm2 vs. 0.968 +/- 0.090 g/cm2 at the total hip (P = 0.17) and 0.989 +/- 0.152 g/cm2 vs. 1.080 +/- 0.097 g/cm2 (P = 0.01) at the lumbar spine. HIV-infected males were more likely to have osteopenia and osteoporosis, as compared to the male controls (19 vs. 14 and 4 vs. 1, respectively, P = 0.02). None of the women had osteoporosis; nine HIV-infected women and one female control had osteopenia (P = 0.003). No fractures were recorded. In this preliminary study, no evidence supporting a relationship between bone loss and protease inhibitor treatment was found.

Nonetheless, with the transformation of HIV infection into a chronic disease, a series of long-term consequences have been observed, among them osteoporosis. The prevalence of this condition is increasing among individuals with HIV infection. Although an epidemic of fragility fractures has not been described in these patients, an increase in the incidence of such fractures is anticipated as the HIV population ages, and this will undoubtedly have an impact on their quality of life. The numerous factors that favor the development of osteoporosis in these patients are related to the infection, itself, and the treatment received.

Two men were lost to follow-up. The mean follow-up time was 62 months. By the end of the follow-up period 26 out of 78 subjects (33%) were diagnosed with AIDS. When controlling for age, year of HIV diagnosis, number of male lifetime partners and frequency of receptive anal intercourse, the adjusted relative risk of being diagnosed with AIDS for the group smoking 1-20 cigarettes daily was 0.4 (0.2-1.2, 95% confidence interval) and 1.1 (0.4-2.7, 95% confidence interval) for the group smoking more than 20 cigarettes daily, as opposed to the non-smoking group. The adjusted relative risk of progression to AIDS for daily alcohol drinkers as opposed to less frequent drinkers was 0.8 (0.3-2.2, 95% confidence interval). The adjusted relative risks of receptive anal intercourse often or usually and more than 500 lifetime male partners were 2.2 and 2.0, respectively. These estimates, however, were not significantly above 1.0. The lack of positive association between cigarette smoking, drinking of alcohol and progression to AIDS found in this study as well as in other studies, may have implication for the understanding of the pathogenesis of the HIV disease and for counselling HIV infected subjects.

Alexithymia (AL) is a trait deficit in the ability to identify and describe feelings, emotions and bodily sensations. A structural equation model was used to test whether high levels of AL indirectly relate to greater non-adherent behavior and HIV disease severity via psychosocial dysfunction. Blood draws for HIV-1 viral load and CD4 T-lymphocyte, along with psychosocial surveys were collected from 439 HIV positive adults aged 18-73 years. The structural model supports significant paths from: (1) AL to non-active patient involvement, psychological distress, and lower social support, (2) psychological distress and non-active involvement to non-adherent behavior, and (3) non-adherence to greater HIV disease severity (CFI = .97, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .05). A second model confirmed the intermediary effect of greater patient assertiveness on the path from AL to social support and non-active patient involvement (CFI = .94, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .05). Altogether, AL is indirectly linked with HIV disease management through it's association with poor psychosocial function, however greater patient assertiveness buffers the negative impact of AL on relationship quality with healthcare providers and members of one's social support network.

Nineteen patients were studied: 7 had a previous HBeAg-positive phase and had spontaneous or therapeutically induced loss of HBeAg (group A); 12 had no previous HBeAg-positive phase (group B). Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed on serum collected during the anti-HBe-positive phase in the two groups. In group A, precore sequencing showed that 5 patients were infected by wild-type virus, 1 patient was infected with a precore mutant, and 1 patient was found to be infected by a mixture of wild-type and precore mutant viruses. In group B, precore sequencing showed that only 1 patient was infected with wild-type virus and that 11 were infected with precore mutants. In a few patients, the presence of HBeAg within immune complexes may explain HBeAg negativity. In conclusion, our results show that, in patients with anti-HBe-positive chronic hepatitis B: (1) precore mutations creating a stop codon are more frequently found in those without known previous HBeAg positivity; (2) after loss of HBeAg, the patients who have anti-HBe-positive reactivation are infected by wild-type virus, which suggests that reactivation is not related to precore mutations; (3) HBeAg negativity may be caused by immune complexes formation.

HIV+ asymptomatic or symptomatic and HIV- homosexual or bisexual men completed self-report measures of psychological and health functioning and participated in structured diagnostic interviews. Additional information regarding HIV-related life events and their potential relationship to onset of disorder and family history of psychiatric disorder were obtained. A high lifetime prevalence of affective and substance use disorder was found, with almost one half of the sample meeting criteria for both disorders. Lifetime affective disorder diagnosis was associated with a positive family history of affective disorder. HIV-related events were most closely associated with onset or recurrence of affective disorder compared with other disorders. Low current rates of psychiatric disorder and levels of emotional distress were found, with no differences in degree of psychiatric adjustment across stage of infection. We conclude that the lifetime prevalence of certain categories of psychiatric disorder is high in both HIV+ and HIV- homosexual samples. Increased rates of psychiatric disorders do not appear to be a consequence of HIV infection. However, episodes of illness, particularly affective disorder, may develop following an HIV-related event such as confirmation of infection. Although symptomatic subjects have more somatic difficulties, there appears to be no relationship between stage of illness and level of emotional distress.

Two students were seropositive (0.06%, 95% confidence interval 0-0.15%). Both were homosexual men with multiple sexual partners. Despite the low prevalence of infection, potential risk factors for transmission of HIV-1 were common, as assessed by a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. These included a previous sexually transmitted disease (12.6%), male homosexual intercourse (4.8% of men), heterosexual anal intercourse (25.3%), heterosexual intercourse with a person at risk (an HIV-1 infected person, a bisexual man, a parenteral drug user, a female prostitute, or a hemophiliac) (5.2%), multiple sexual partners (21% reported 10 or more lifetime partners), and intravenous drug use (1.3%). Assessment of the efficacy of our program by comparing responses on pre- and post-test questionnaires showed gains in knowledge about heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 and an increase in the reported frequency of condom use 1-2 months after participating in the survey. The authors conclude that HIV-1 infections are occurring among college students but in our study group remain confined to persons with known high-risk behavior; however, practices that may support transmission are common, and programs designed to diminish these behaviors among college students are needed.

Major cofactors that possibly increase the efficiency of heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 include genital ulcer disease, multiple sexual exposures, lack of male circumcision, and primary and advanced stages of HIV-1 disease. I report the case of a 33-year-old woman who was recently infected with HIV-1 after one to three nontraumatic episodes of vaginal intercourse with a healthy-appearing, HIV-1-infected, bisexual man. An investigation of her exposure history revealed the precise time frame during which infection occurred. The patient developed a primary HIV-1-infection syndrome and became seropositive for HIV-1 within eight weeks of her last sexual contact with the infected man. An epidemiological and laboratory evaluation of the index patient and her sexual partner identified only one risk factor for enhanced HIV-1 transmission: the patient's use of oral contraceptives. Her partner was immunologically intact, HIV-1 antigen negative, and circumcised. Both of the individuals were from Minnesota, as were their recent sexual partners. This case illustrates that HIV-1 infection by vaginal intercourse can occur in the absence of the major risk factors believed to increase the efficiency of transmission. Even in a low HIV-1 prevalence area like Minnesota, efforts to promote awareness of HIV-1 status, abstinence, non-penetrative sex, or barrier protection need to be expanded and the behaviors adopted by sexually active persons if HIV-1 transmission is to be minimized.

The patients were interviewed extensively for potential risk factors associated with transmission. Of the 203 patients with type B hepatitis, 34 (30 men, 4 women) showed serologic evidence of acute HDV infection (HDV+ group), while the other 169 did not (HDV- group). Of the 30 HDV+ men, 27 (90%) had had sexual intercourse with prostitutes within 3 months of admission, while only 31 (22.7%) of the 136 HDV- men, 8 (17.4%) of the 46 men with non-A, non-B hepatitis and 5 (8.3%) of the 60 control men had done so (P less than .001). Of the 4 HDV+ women, 1 was a prostitute and another was the wife of a patient with active HDV infection. There was no significant difference in exposure to other risk factors among these groups of patients. The results suggest that heterosexual exposure, particularly prostitute contact, is the most important route of HDV transmission in the general population of this area endemic for HBV infection.

The series of 178 HIV-seropositive women was enrolled in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Siriraj Hospital. Demographic, obstetrical and behavioral risk factors were interviewed. Laboratory results were recorded. Clinical gynecologic examination was performed including Pap smear. The patients were assigned into two groups, HPV and non-HPV group. The comparison of the potential risk factors between the groups was calculated statistically. It was found that the prevalence of HPV infection was reported in 17 patients (9.6%). HIV-seropositive women, who were infected with HPV, had a significantly more probability to have a single partner in their lifetime than those who were not infected. It could be that HPV cervical infection and HIV-seropositive women share common potential risk factors, as well as, the recognition of sexual intercourse as the important route of HPV transmission.

Socio-demographic and seven-day period symptom prevalence and distress data were self-reported using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Schedule. QOL was assessed using the Medical Outcome Scale and functional performance using the Karnofsky Performance Scale. Symptom clusters were established using hierarchical cluster analysis with squared Euclidean distances using Ward's clustering methods based on symptom occurrence. Analysis of variance compared clusters on mean QOL and functional performance scores. Patient subgroups were categorised based on symptom occurrence rates. Five symptom occurrence clusters were identified: Cluster 1 (n=107), high-low for sensory discomfort and eating difficulties symptoms; Cluster 2 (n=47), high-low for psycho-gastrointestinal symptoms; Cluster 3 (n=71), high for pain and sensory disturbance symptoms; Cluster 4 (n=35), all high for general HIV/AIDS symptoms; and Cluster 5 (n=48), all low for mood-cognitive symptoms. The all high occurrence cluster was associated with worst functional status, poorest QOL scores and highest symptom-associated distress. Use of antiretroviral therapy was associated with all high symptom occurrence rate (Fisher's exact=4, P<0.001). CD4 count group below 200 was associated with the all high occurrence rate symptom cluster (Fisher's exact=41, P<0.001). Symptom clusters have a differential, affect HIV/AIDS patients' self-reported outcomes, with the subgroup experiencing high-symptom occurrence rates having a higher risk of poorer outcomes. Identification of symptom clusters could provide insights into commonly co-occurring symptoms that should be jointly targeted for management in patients with multiple complaints.

We assessed New York area care providers for people living with HIV regarding attitudes, knowledge, and practice patterns toward fertility and conception in serodiscordant couples. Data were collected via a survey distributed in October 2013. Seventeen percent of respondents reported prescribing antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for a woman in a serodiscordant couple, and 38% percent of respondents reported having counseled serodiscordant couples on timed, unprotected intercourse without PrEP. Respondents who reported being "very" familiar with the data on HIV transmission in serodiscordant couples were more likely to report counseling their patients in timed, unprotected intercourse compared with those who reported less familiarity with the data (41% vs. 8%, p = 0.001). Although only 20% reported being "very" or "somewhat" familiar with the data on the safety of sperm washing with intrauterine insemination, those who did were more likely to have reported referring a patient for assisted reproductive technology (61% vs. 32%, p = 0.006). Effective patient counseling and referral for appropriate reproductive options were associated with knowledge of the literature pertaining to these options. This emphasizes the need for further provider education on reproductive options and appropriate counseling for serodiscordant couples.

We examined the prevalence and covariates of injecting drug use among men participating in the Sydney Gay Community Periodic Survey between 2004-06 and 2011. In 2004-06, data was collected about which drugs were injected, while in 2011, data was collected about hepatitis C (HCV) and esoteric sexual practices. In 2004-06, 5.6 % of men reported injecting drugs in the previous 6 months; 3.4 % reported methamphetamine injection and 0.4 % heroin injection. In 2011, men who injected drugs were less likely to be employed full-time, and more likely to be HCV-positive, HIV-positive, to have used party drugs for sex, and to have engaged in esoteric sexual practices. The strong associations between injecting drug use, sexual risk practices and blood-borne virus infection suggests the need for combined sexual health and harm reduction services for gay and bisexual men who inject drugs.

HIV medication expense is typically covered by third party payers. However, private insurance premiums and deductibles may rise, or policies terminated such as with a change in employment. Likewise, a patient's eligibility for publicly funded coverage like state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP) or Medicaid can also be lost. We conducted a one-time survey of a sample of 300 patients receiving HIV care at a single large academic center in the south of United States to examine lapses in HIV therapy due to financial reasons. We found that during the prior year, financial issues including medication cost or coverage led to a lapse in ARVs in 10% (n = 31) of participants. However, of the 42% (n = 125) participants who had been enrolled in ADAP at any time during the prior year, 21% (n = 26) reported an ARV lapse due to problems with ADAP or medication cost. Respondents cited ADAP's required semi-annual renewal process and other administrative issues as the cause of ARV lapses. The median duration of missed ARVs was 2 weeks (range of <1-23 weeks). Non-HIV medication and transportation to and from clinic costs were also identified as financial burdens to care by respondents. In conclusion, although conducted at a single medical center and one state, this study suggests that a significant minority of HIV-infected patients encounter financial barriers to ARV access, and this is paradoxically more common among those enrolled in the state ADAP. Streamlining, supporting, and simplifying ADAP renewal procedures will likely reduce lapses in ARV adherence and persistence.

To accomplish this, a direct three-color monoclonal antibody labeling technique was employed to identify immune cells in fresh ejaculates. Once labeled, the percent of each immune subset present in the ejaculate was determined by flow cytometric analysis. The percent of CD3+ cells present in the semen of the HIV+ group showed no significant difference when compared with semen from the HIV- group. Analysis of the CD4+ subset yielded a significantly lower percent in the HIV+ group than in the HIV- group. The analysis of the CD8+ subset yielded a higher percent of cells present in semen from HIV+ individuals. The CD8 higher value along with lower CD4 value results in a lower CD4/CD8 ratio in the HIV+ group. Further subset studies showed that the percent of cells expressing naive (CD4+ CD45RA+) and memory (CD4+ CD45RO+) markers was lower in the HIV+ group. This study provides additional data supporting the utility of flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies to immunophenotypic cells present in semen ejaculates. It is also the first reported application of the technique to a disease-based model and may be useful to better understand issues of mucosal immunity and transmission of sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV.
=> 4th document retrieved: Order: 16513, Title: Management of hepatitis C in HIV and/or HBV co-infected patients., Abstract: Co-infection with either HIV or HBV in chronic hepatitis C patients is common, since all these viruses share transmission routes and geographical distribution. Interaction between these viruses generally amplifies liver damage, increasing the risk of developing end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. HIV-HCV co-infection is associated with poorer response to antiviral therapy. New antivirals against HCV are eagerly awaited for this population. HBV-HCV dual infections are less common. The principles guiding indication of therapy in monoinfected patients should be followed considering which virus replicates in persons with serological markers of dual HBV-HCV infection. Although there is growing evidence supporting the use of direct acting antivirals (DAA) in dually infected patients with active HCV replication, prospective trials should be conducted to demonstrate their benefit, assessing carefully the rate and clinical consequences of HBV rebounds.

Recently, the cell culture systems supporting complete replication and production of HCV genotype 2a (JFH1) have been established. This study investigated the effect of low-speed centrifugation on HCV JFH1 infection of human hepatocytes (Huh7.5.1). Higher levels of HCV RNA expression were observed in Huh7.5.1 cells infected with centrifugal inoculation of HCV JFH1 than those in the control cells. This increased HCV RNA expression was associated with the elevated expression of HCV NS3 protein in the hepatocytes. The centrifugal enhancement of HCV infection was time and speed dependent. However, the enhancement was not observed when centrifugation was performed before or after HCV infection. In addition, there was no association between centrifugal enhancement and the expression of HCV entry receptors (CD81 and claudin-1) and intracellular IFN-alpha in the hepatocytes. These data indicate that centrifugal inoculation is a useful tool for increasing the efficiency of HCV infection and replication in the target cells in vitro.

HIV influences HCV variability in the plasma; however, limited data on viral variability are available from distinct tissue/cell compartments in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Thus, this exploratory study evaluated diversity of the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of HCV in the plasma and liver for 14 patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Median intra-patient genetic distances and entropy values were similar in the plasma and liver compartments. Positive immune selection pressure was observed in the plasma for five individuals and in the liver for three individuals. Statistical evidence supporting viral compartmentalization was found in five individuals. Linear regression identified ALT (P = 0.0104) and AST (P = 0.0130) as predictors of viral compartmentalization. A total of 12 signature amino acids that distinguish liver from plasma E1/HVR1 were identified. One signature amino acid was shared by at least two individuals. These findings suggest that HCV compartmentalization is relatively common among patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. These data also imply that evaluating viral diversity, including drug resistance patterns, in the serum/plasma only may not adequately represent viruses replicating with in the liver and, thus, deserves careful consideration in future studies.

This study investigates the impact of HCV in HIV coinfected patients with undetectable viraemia under HAART on the levels of peripheral T cell's immune-activation. We determined T lymphocytes subsets to characterize immune-activation defined as CD38 and/or HLA-DR expression in chronic monoinfected HCV, HIV, and HIV/HCV coinfected subjects. One hundred and fifty six patients were divided into three groups: (i) 77 HIV+ patients; (ii) 50 HCV+ patients; and (iii) 29 coinfected HIV/HCV patients. The level of CD4(+) was significantly higher in HCV+ than in HIV+ or in coinfected HIV/HCV subjects. The frequencies of CD4(+) CD38(+) /HLA-DR(-) , CD4(+) CD38(-) /HLA-DR(+) and CD4(+) CD38(+) /HLA-DR(+) in HIV+ patients were comparable to those measured in coinfected patients, but statistically higher than those observed in HCV+ subjects. The percentage of CD8(+) was comparable in HIV-1+ patients and coinfected HIV/HCV but the results obtained in both groups were significantly higher compared to the results obtained in HCV patients. The level of CD8(+) CD38(+) /HLA-DR(-) showed values lower in HIV+ patients than in that monoinfected HCV and coinfected HIV/HCV patients. The frequencies of CD8(+) CD38(-) /HLA-DR(+) were higher in HIV+ patients compared to HCV+ and coinfected HIV/HCV patients. HIV/HCV coinfected group showed highest levels of CD8(+) CD38(+) /HLA-DR(+) . HIV plays a pivotal role to determine the immune activation in the host. The role of HCV needs of further investigations but our data show that HCV mainly influences the immune-activation of the pool of CD8, but also probably plays a supporting additive effect on CD4 immune-activation.

We compared the characteristics of hepatitis C in two groups of hematologic patients with different levels of immunocompetence who acquired the same virus strain after treatment with contaminated intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). Indications for IVIG therapy were idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in six patients and hypogammaglobulinemia in 7 patients with various hematologic disorders, who were defined immunodeficient (ID). Infection rate was 100%. Five ID patients never developed HCV antibodies despite serum HCV-RNA positivity. The same HCV genotype was shown in 10 patients tested. Moreover, E1-E2 gene partial nucleotide sequencing, performed in four patients, showed identical or closely related amino acid sequences, thus strongly supporting the hypothesis of a common source of infection. Clinical acute infection did not differ significantly between the two groups, but subsequent liver failure developed in five of the seven ID patients and in none of the ITP patients (P = .04). Liver biopsy, performed in three cases, documented HCV as the only cause of liver damage. Six ID patients died, with liver disease being the primary cause of death in four cases and a contributory cause in two cases. Their median survival after IVIG was 12 months, significantly worse than that of ITP patients (P = .0028). We conclude that immunodeficiency markedly worsens the course of IVIG-acquired HCV infection in hematologic patients.

In this study, the safety, tolerability, antiviral activity and pharmacokinetics (PK) of GS-9857 were evaluated in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-4 infection. Patients with genotype 1-4 infection received placebo or once-daily GS-9857 at doses ranging from 50 to 300 mg for 3 days under fasting conditions. GS-9857 was well tolerated; all reported adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate in severity. Diarrhoea and headache were the most commonly reported AEs. Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were observed in 17% of patients receiving GS-9857; there were no Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase levels. GS-9857 demonstrated potent antiviral activity in patients with chronic HCV infection, achieving mean and median maximum reductions in HCV RNA of ≥3 log10 IU/mL following administration of a 100-mg dose in patients with HCV genotype 1a, 1b, 2, 3 or 4 infection. The antiviral activity of GS-9857 was unaffected by the presence of pretreatment NS3 RAVs. In patients with genotype 1-4 infection, GS-9857 exhibited linear PK and was associated with a median half-life of 29-42 h, supporting once-daily dosing. Thus, the tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of GS-9857 support its further evaluation for treatment of patients with chronic HCV infection.

In this study, the prevalence of HGV-RNA and antibodies to E2 envelope antigen (anti-E2) which is a marker of past infection, have been investigated in the samples of patients with HCV and HBV infections, and the prevalence rates were compared with the control group. The study group consisted of 50 patients with HBV and 50 patients with HCV infections, who did not have any risk for parenteral transmission, and 60 healthy control subjects. Serum samples were tested for the presence of HGV-RNA by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for anti-E2 by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As a result, HGV-RNA and anti-HGV-E2 positivity rates in HBV and HCV infected patients were found as; 4% and 6%, 4% and 4%, respectively. Although the prevalence of HGV-RNA in patients with HBV and HCV infections were higher than the control group (1.66%), there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05). The prevalence of anti-E2 antibodies in patients with HBV and HCV infections did not revealed any difference in comparison to the control group (6.66%) (p>0.05). In conclusion, GBV-C/HGV infection prevalence was found low in patients with HBV and HCV infections, supporting that although parenteral route is the most effective way, other routes such as sexual contact and intra-familial contact may also play role in HGV transmission.

The impact of baseline V3 characteristics on treatment response was evaluated in a randomised, double blind, prospective cohort study with patients initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy with lopinavir or efavirenz plus azithothymidine/3TC (1:1) over 48 weeks. Similar virological and immunological responses were observed for both treatment regimens. The 43 individuals had a mean baseline CD4 T cell count of 119 cells/mm(3) [standard deviation (SD) = 99] and a mean viral load of 5.09 log(10) copies/mL (SD = 0.49). The GWGR motif was not associated with a CD4 T cell response, but predicted R5 tropism by the geno2pheno([clinical20%]) algorithm correlated with higher CD4 T cell levels at all monitoring points (p < 0.05). Moreover, higher false-positive rates (FPR) values from this analysis revealed a strong correlation with CD4 T cell recovery (p < 0.0001). Transmitted drug resistance mutations, documented in 3/41 (7.3%) cases, were unrelated to the assigned antiretroviral regimen and had no impact on patient outcomes. In conclusion, naÏve HIV-1 R5 infected patients exhibited higher CD4 T cell counts at baseline; this difference was sustained throughout therapy. The geno2pheno([clinical]) option FPR positively correlated with CD4 T cell gain and may be useful in predicting CD4 T cell recovery.

Thus, predicting non-response is of major interest for both patient wellbeing and health care expense.

Lymphocytes from 215 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV)-infected women and 192 of their infants were analyzed by flow cytometry with an extended three-color panel of monoclonal antibodies. Women who did not transmit to their infants tended to have higher CD4+ T cells. Most notably, levels of total CD8+ T cells and CD8+ CD38+ cells made significant independent contributions to predicting the risk of mother-to-child transmission. Adjusting for HIV-1 RNA level at entry, a one percentage-point increase in these marker combinations was associated with a nine percent increase in the likelihood of maternal transmission. Total as well as naive CD4+ T cells were significantly higher in uninfected than infected infants. Total CD8+ cells, as well as CD8+ cells positive for HLA-DR+, CD45 RA+ HLA-DR+, and CD28+ HLA-DR+ were elevated in infected infants. Detailed immunophenotyping may be helpful in predicting which pregnant HIV-infected women are at increased risk of transmitting HIV to their infants. Increasing differences in lymphocyte subsets between infected and uninfected infants became apparent as early as six weeks of age. Detailed immunophenotyping may be useful in supporting the diagnosis of HIV infection in infants with perinatal HIV exposure.

Forty-three consecutive antiretroviral-naive patients were prospectively analysed for clinical, biochemical, immunological and virological parameters at starting HAART, and followed for 4 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter. At baseline, all patients underwent a thoracic computer tomography scan, in order to measure thymic volume, as well, T-cell phenotype (naive CD4 and CD8 T cells) and the number of TREC-bearing cells were obtained. CD4 cell repopulation was considered as an increase > or = 200 cells/mm3 above baseline count. Twenty-seven patients (62.8%) increased > or = 200 cells/mm3 above baseline levels during the follow-up. The median time to event was 182 days (84-537 days). On the univariate analysis, to be younger than 36 years, showing a CD4 cell count > or = 272 cells/mm3, a total naive T-cell count > or = 128 cells/mm3, a TREC-bearing cell count > or = 0.74 cells/mm3, and a thymic volume > or =3.07 cc at baseline were statistically associated to the event studied. However, when the multivariate analysis was performed, only thymic volume at baseline was independently associated (P=0.002) to CD4 cell recovery. This co-variable was identified as a positive predictor [hazard ratio, 1.22 (95% confidence interval: 1.16-1.28)]. In summary, data presented herewith show that thymic volume is the best thymic function-related marker for predicting early CD4 T-cell recovery in adult HIV-infected patients under HAART.

Reported non-invasive techniques for assessment of blood pressure in this population have been limited to sphygmomanometry. The present crosssectional study investigated the impact of antiretroviral therapy and the HAART-associated lipodystrophy on aortic blood pressure conditions and arterial stiffness in HAART-treated lipodystrophic (n=42) and non-lipodystrophic (n=17) patients. Pulse wave analysis, novel to this population, was used to evaluate measures of arterial stiffness, including the heart rate corrected augmentation index, AgI(HR). Results indicated no significant difference between the study groups in peripheral or aortic blood pressure and AgI(HR). Significant correlates of AgI(HR) included age (P = 0.003), duration of antiretroviral therapy (P = 0.020), lamivudine therapy (P = 0.015) and ritonavir therapy (P = 0.016) as well as cumulative exposure to protease inhibitors (P = 0.030). Time since HIV diagnosis, severity of immunodeficiency or presence of HAART-associated lipodystrophy bore no relationship to AgI(HR). In multivariate analysis, duration of antiretroviral therapy (P = 0.046), cumulative exposure to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (P = 0.032) and to protease inhibitors (P = 0.011) were identified as independent factors predicting AgI(HR). Prolonged antiretroviral treatment, thus, delineates as a risk factor for systemic arterial stiffness and the associated cardiovascular mortality.

Since periods of abstinence may be interspersed with drug misuse, it is necessary to establish the safety of zidovudine in injection drug misuse-related human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection under a variety of conditions. HIV serology became available in October 1985 and we have now examined medically 289 HIV seropositive patients, 85% of whom acquired their infection via injection drug misuse. Since March 1987 we have treated 40 individuals with zidovudine, 25 of whom were former or current injection drug misusers and one who was a heterosexual contact of a drug misuser. Eighteen patients were taking various types of opiates. Six of this latter group injected either occasionally or regularly whilst taking zidovudine. There were no adverse clinical events associated with zidovudine treatment and continued opiate drug misuse whether by mouth or by injection. Although defaults from clinic visits were a problem, these defaults were not associated with any particular form of drug misuse. Compliance with zidovudine therapy as judged by change in the mean corpuscular volume was no different for the various risk groups. In our experience it is possible to treat safely current and former drug misusers with zidovudine.

In this patient category, the safety of different immunosuppressive biologic therapies, including rituximab, was assessed. A total of 1218 Caucasian rheumatologic patients, admitted consecutively as outpatients between 2001 and 2012 and taking biologic therapies, underwent evaluation of anti-HCV and HBV markers as well as liver amino transferases every 3 months. Starting from January 2009, HBV DNA monitoring was performed in patients with a prHBV infection who had started immunosuppressive biologic therapy both before and after 2009. Patients were considered to have elevated aminotransferase levels if values were >1× upper normal limit at least once during follow-up. We found 179 patients with a prHBV infection (14 treated with rituximab, 146 with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and 19 with other biologic therapies) and 959 patients without a prHBV infection or other liver disease (controls). The mean age in the former group was significantly higher than the controls. Patients with a prHBV infection never showed detectable HBV DNA serum levels or antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen/hepatitis B surface antigen seroreversion. However, when the prevalence of elevated amino transferases in patients with prHBV infection was compared to controls, it was significantly higher in the former group only for aminotransferase levels >1× upper normal limit but not when aminotransferase levels >2× upper normal limit were considered.

Increased sexual risk taking has been described in HIV-infected individuals receiving potent antiretroviral therapy. A new questionnaire on sexual behavior was introduced into the Swiss HIV Cohort Study on April 1, 2000. We evaluated sexual behavior in all individuals who completed the questionnaire for the first time within 1 year after its introduction. Our primary hypothesis was that self-reported unsafe sexual behavior would be more prevalent among individuals with optimal viral suppression. On April 1, 2000, 4948 individuals were registered in the study, and 4723 (95%) completed the questionnaire. Of these individuals, 12% reported unsafe sex, 78% received antiretroviral therapy, and 25% had optimal viral suppression (HIV RNA level always <50 copies/mL during the preceding 12 months). During the preceding 6 months, 55% of individuals had stable and 19% had occasional partners, and 6% had both types of partners. Sexual intercourse was reported by 82% of individuals with stable and 87% of individuals with occasional partners, and of those reporting sexual intercourse in each group, 76% and 86%, respectively, said that they always used condoms. After adjustment for covariates, reported unsafe sex was not associated with optimal viral suppression (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.33) or antiretroviral therapy (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.07), but it was associated with gender, age, ethnicity, HIV transmission group, HIV status of partner, having occasional partners, and living alone. There is no evidence that self-reported unsafe sexual behavior is more prevalent among HIV-infected individuals with optimal viral suppression. However, unsafe sex is associated with other factors.

In this guideline, we review the types of chronic pain commonly seen among persons living with HIV (PLWH) and review the limited evidence base for treatment of chronic noncancer pain in this population. We also review the management of chronic pain in special populations of PLWH, including persons with substance use and mental health disorders. Finally, a general review of possible pharmacokinetic interactions is included to assist the HIV clinician in the treatment of chronic pain in this population.It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. The Infectious Diseases Society of American considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances.

Different types of genetic heterogeneity of HIV-1 can be analyzed: the extension and the evolution of the viral quasispecies in blood, the variation between the virus obtained from different body compartment, the differences between isolates from diverse individuals and between HIV-1 subtypes. The virus population during primary HIV-1 infection is generally homogeneous and the intrahost viral evolution is thought to be forced (in absence of antiviral therapy) by the immune system pressure and is generally related to the length of the immunocompetent period. A group of 12 Italian and Swedish well characterized HIV-1 infected long-term nonprogressors (LNTP) have been analyzed for the viral heterogeneity, calculated in the nef gene and in the long terminal repeat (LTR). The intra-sample variations in LTNP were found comparable with those from 8 progressor patients, while a lower inter-individual diversity was observed in the former. In one LTNP the viral evolution during a four-years period was extremely low suggesting that other factors than the host immune pressure may be involved in modulating the intra- and inter-sample HIV-1 diversity.

This study reports on a subset (Latino/Hispanic self-identified youth, n=14) of qualitatively interviewed youth (n=30), both in individual interviews and in focus group discussion settings, aware of their HIV diagnosis for 12-24 months (mean: 16.7 months; standard deviation [SD], 4.89) Youth were 16-24 years old (M=21.5 years), female (43%) and males (57%). Youth were recruited from three cities: Chicago, New York, and San Juan (Puerto Rico). Interviews of Latinos (n=14) were reviewed for sources of stressors and support. Seven themes emerged in analyzing stated sources of stressors: (1) initial psychosocial responses to HIV diagnosis, (2) disclosure to family and friends, (3) stigma related to receiving an HIV diagnosis, (4) body image and concerns of the physical changes associated with HIV and antiretroviral medications, (5) taking antiretroviral medications and side effects, (6) the disruption of their future life goals, and (7) reproductive health concerns. Identified sources of support and coping were described including; gaining appreciation for what matters in life, adapting and developing achievable goals, reordering priorities and relying on religion and spiritual beliefs for health outcomes. The information gathered is from individual interviews and from focus group discussions can be used to increase the understanding of this understudied population while improving services to engage and retain these youth in care.

Human immunodeficiency virus-infected subjects taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) were matched on age, race, and gender and were enrolled into one of the following two groups: group 1: subjects taking TDF plus lopinavir/ritonavir plus other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs); group 2: subjects taking TDF plus NRTIs and/or non-NRTIs but no protease inhibitors. Twenty-four-hour blood and urine collections were carried out in subjects for tenofovir quantification. Drug transporter genotype associations with tenofovir pharmacokinetics were examined. In 30 subjects, median (range) tenofovir apparent oral clearance, renal clearance, and fraction excreted in urine were 34.6 l/h (20.6-89.5), 11.3 l/h (6.2-22.6), and 0.33 (0.23-0.5), respectively. After adjusting for renal function, tenofovir renal clearance was 17.5% slower (P=0.04) in subjects taking lopinavir/ritonavir versus those not taking a protease inhibitor, consistent with a renal interaction between these drugs. Future studies should clarify the exact mechanism and whether there is an increased risk of nephrotoxicity.

A one-group pretest-posttest study was conducted among 605 marriage license applicants. The following relationships showed statistical significance in path analysis: (1) HIV/AIDS knowledge --> worry [beta (Standardized coefficient) = -0.39]; (2) worry --> public stigma (beta = 0.27); (3) public stigma --> felt stigma (beta = 0.22); and (4) felt stigma --> intention to disclosure (beta = -0.20). Separate path analyses for males and females generated similar association patterns. HIV counseling reduced perceived worry but exerted little impact on HIV-related stigma and the intention. The pathway from a lack of HIV/AIDS knowledge to increased stigma and to decreased intention to disclose one's serostatus is particularly policy relevant as decreased intention to disclosure may be related to continuing practice of HIV risk behaviors. The findings demonstrate interventions aiming at the reduction of stigma should be targeted at both the individual and community levels.

This group has been the focus of little research, however. This paper presents quantitative and qualitative data from 80 former Soviet immigrants (ages 18-29) to characterize their opioid use trajectories, injection risk behavior, HCV/HIV testing histories and self-reported HCV/HIV serostatus, and provides clinically meaningful data to inform tailored education, prevention and harm reduction interventions.

Between March 2010 and September 2011, using a social ecological framework, we investigated barriers to ART initiation in Lusaka, Zambia. In-depth interviews were conducted with PLHIV who were offered treatment but declined (n=37), ART staff (n=5), faith healers (n=5), herbal medicine providers (n=5), and home-based care providers (n=5). One focus group discussion with lay HIV counselors and observations in the community and at an ART clinic were conducted. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated, coded using Atlas ti, and analyzed using latent content analysis. Lack of self-efficacy, negative perceptions of medication, desire for normalcy, and fear of treatment-induced physical body changes, all modulated by feeling healthy, undermined treatment initiation. Social relationships generated and perpetuated these health and treatment beliefs. Long waiting times at ART clinics, concerns about long-term availability of treatment, and taking strong medication amidst livelihood insecurity also dissuaded PLHIV from initiating treatment. PLHIV opted for herbal remedies and faith healing as alternatives to ART, with the former being regarded as effective as ART, while the latter contributed to restoring normalcy through the promise of being healed. Barriers to treatment initiation were not mutually exclusive. Some coalesced to undermine treatment initiation. Ensuring patients initiate ART requires interventions at different levels, addressing, in particular, people's health and treatment beliefs, changing perceptions about effectiveness of herbal remedies and faith healing, improving ART delivery to attenuate social and economic costs and allaying concerns about future non-availability of treatment.

The incidence of AIDS was calculated in the general population and examined further according to gender, age (< or = or >49 years), and heterosexual behaviour as a risk factor for HIV. Multivariate analysis was used to identify variables associated with AIDS presenters (defined as patients diagnosed with AIDS within 1 month of the first HIV-positive test). The numbers of patients with AIDS classified as (i) AIDS presenters, (ii) known HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral treatment, and (iii) known HIV-positive patients not receiving antiretroviral treatment were calculated. The overall incidence of AIDS decreased over time, mainly due to the lower number of patients on antiretroviral treatment developing AIDS. Factors associated with a higher risk of being an AIDS presenter were male gender and year of HIV diagnosis. Among patients with AIDS, the proportion of AIDS presenters increased from 13.8% prior to 1997 (when protease inhibitors were introduced in Italy) to 32.5% after 1997. Variables predictive of being an AIDS presenter were male gender, age at diagnosis, and AIDS diagnosis in the years 1997-2000. Heterosexuals had a higher risk of being AIDS presenters and a lower risk of being HIV-positive and not receiving antiretroviral treatment than intravenous drug users. In Italy, AIDS occurs mainly in subjects unaware of their HIV status (especially males, the elderly, and those infected heterosexually) or in patients refusing antiretroviral therapy (mainly intravenous drug users who do not refer to specialised centres).

Thirty-nine (31.5%) of 124 individuals with HCV-4 achieved SVR compared with 103 (22.7%) of 453 individuals with HCV genotype 1 (P=0.046). Only interleukin-28B (IL28B) genotype CC was independently associated with SVR in HIV/HCV-4-coinfected patients. The efficacy of peg-IFN with RBV in coinfected individuals with genotype 4 is significantly higher than in those with genotype 1. IL28B CC genotype is the main predictor of response in this population.

Conversely, EBV has been rarely associated with encephalitis in HIV patients. Here we describe for the first time the case of an HIV-infected, late presenter Caucasian man, diagnosed with a rapidly progressive diffuse encephalitis at presentation. A very high viral load for EBV was detected in CSF by PCR. The patient died 12 days after the onset of encephalitis in spite of supportive, antiviral and antiretroviral therapy. Our experience would suggest that in profoundly immunosuppressed HIV patients EBV may cause severe encephalitis in the absence of lymphoproliferative disorders.

Concerns exist as to their efficacy in patients with viral loads (VL) above 100,000 copies/ml, a feature common to about 75% of HIV-1-infected patients presenting at the Joint Clinical Research Center (JCRC) in Uganda. Furthermore, there are few data on the response to such therapy of non-B subtypes, A and D, predominant in Uganda. Presented here is a retrospective analysis of therapeutic responses in 11 antiretroviral (ARV) naïve HIV-1-infected Ugandan patients who had been initiated on zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), and efavirenz (EFV). Laboratory assessments subsequent to initiation of ARV therapy, done at 11.6 +/- 3.9 weeks and 30.6 +/- 5.9 weeks, showed 88.9 and 71.4% patients achieved undetectable viral load, respectively. Virological suppression to below detection occurred in 85.7% of patients at 11.6 weeks despite baseline VL >or= 100,000 copies/ml. At 31 weeks there was a median increment of +183 cells/mm(3) in CD4(+) T lymphocytes. These findings reflect significant efficacy in the use of AZT + 3TC + EFV in advanced ARV naive non-B subtype HIV-1-infected patients. The therapeutic responses were comparable to those previously described in the western world.

However, its clinical use is limited because of rapid emergence of T20-resistant viruses in T20-treated patients. Therefore, T1249 and T1144 are being developed as the second- and third-generation HIV fusion inhibitors, respectively, with improved efficacy and drug resistance profiles. Here, we found that combinations of T20 with T1249 and/or T1144 resulted in exceptionally potent synergism (combination index, <0.01) against HIV-1-mediated membrane fusion by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude in dose reduction. Highly potent synergistic antiviral efficacy was also achieved against infection by laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 strains, including T20-resistant variants. The mechanism underlying the synergistic effect could be attributed to the fact that T20, T1249, and T1144 all contain different functional domains and have different primary binding sites in gp41. As such, they may work cooperatively to inhibit gp41 six-helix bundle core formation, thereby suppressing virus-cell fusion. Therefore, these findings strongly imply that, rather than replacing T20, combining it with HIV fusion inhibitors of different generations might produce synergistic activity against both T20-sensitive and -resistant HIV-1 strains, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection/AIDS.

The AMBER-CEE study aimed to assess real-world efficacy and safety of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/+ dasabuvir ±ribavirin (OBV/PTV/r/ +DSV±RBV) in the treatment of post-transplant recurrence of HCV infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS Liver transplant recipients with recurrent HCV genotype 1 infection, scheduled for OBV/PTV/r/+DSV±RBV according to therapeutic guidelines, were eligible. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR) 12 weeks after the end of treatment (FU12). Clinical and laboratory adverse events (AEs) were recorded from baseline to FU12. RESULTS A total of 35 patients were included: 91.4% genotype 1b-infected, 94.3% treatment-experienced, and 77.1% at fibrosis stage ≥F2. SVR12 was achieved by all patients (35/35, 100%) including one patient with genotype 1a, one patient with detectable HCV RNA at the end of treatment, two patients with a history of first-generation DAA therapy, and two patients who prematurely discontinued the regimen. AEs were experienced by 22 patients (62.9%) and were mostly mild. No death, graft loss, or acute graft rejections were reported during the therapy. On-treatment hepatic decompensation occurred in three patients (8.6%). Anemia was observed in 29 patients (83.9%), with 21 (60%) requiring RBV dose reduction or discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS OBV/PTV/r/+DSV±RBV has excellent efficacy in post-transplant recurrence of HCV genotype 1-infection treated under real-world conditions. Excellent virologic outcomes were observed irrespective of prior treatment history or the degree of fibrosis, and AEs were mostly mild and transient.

Our aim was to assess the effects of peginterferon-α 2a and ribavirin plasma levels on viral kinetics and SVR in hepatitis C virus genotype 1 HCV-1/HIV-co-infected patients according to IL28B genotype. This was a cohort study of HCV-1/HIV-co-infected patients who were HCV-treatment naïve and for whom the efficacy of peginterferon-α 2a plus ribavirin was evaluated by per-protocol analysis. The peginterferon-α 2a and ribavirin levels were measured by ELISA and HPLC-UV, respectively. The relationships among host and viral factors, the trough drugs levels and virological responses were analysed by multivariate regression analyses. A total of 131 Caucasian patients were included (cirrhosis:38.9%). Overall, SVR rate was 39.6%. In patients with CC IL28B genotype, SVR was related neither to peginterferon-α 2a nor to ribavirin plasma levels, while higher levels of both drugs were the only variables independently associated with SVR in individuals with CT/TT IL28B genotypes (OR, 5.02; CI95 , 1.45-17.1; P = 0.001 and 4.0; CI95 , 1.08-14.7; P = 0.038, respectively). Moreover, faster viral declines were observed in CT/TT patients when pegIFN-α 2a and ribavirin plasma levels were greater than 3400 pg/mL and 1.6 μg/mL, respectively. In contrast to the results for CC patients, the results in patients carrying the unfavourable CT/TT IL28B genotypes showed that plasma levels of both drugs have significant effects on viral kinetics and SVR.

In this report we investigated the effect(s) of the PI indinavir on protease activity by Cryptococcus neoformans, an opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for recurrent meningoencephalitis in AIDS patients. Indinavir was also tested for potential effects on other parameters, such as fungal viability, growth ability and susceptibility to immune effector cells. It was found that indinavir impaired cryptococcal protease activity in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. The phenomenon was similarly detectable in ATCC/laboratory strains and clinical isolates. C. neoformans growth rate was also significantly reduced upon exposure to indinavir, while fungal viability was not affected and mitochondrial toxicity not detected. Furthermore, as assessed by an in vitro infection model, indinavir significantly and consistently augmented C. neoformans susceptibility to microglial cell-mediated phagocytosis and killing. Overall, by providing the first evidence that indinavir directly affects C. neoformans, these data add new in vitro insights on the wide-spectrum efficacy of PIs, further arguing for the clinical relevance of HAART against opportunistic infections in AIDS.

The goal of this study was to determine if sclerostin is related to bone physiology and cardiovascular disease during antiretroviral treatment in HIV-infected persons. This was a cross-sectional analysis from study entry into the Stopping Atherosclerosis and Treating Unhealthy bone with RosuvastatiN in HIV (SATURN) trial, an ongoing randomized trial comparing rosuvastatin to placebo in HIV-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy. Plasma sclerostin was measured at study entry by ELISA from participants with available samples. Spearman correlation and multivariable linear regression were used to test relationships between sclerostin and bone density or bone turnover and cardiovascular disease. Among 139 HIV-infected participants (median age 46 years, CD4 lymphocyte count 614 cells/μl), the median plasma sclerostin level was 444.1 (IQR 330.3, 570.1) pg/ml. Correlations were detected between sclerostin and age (r=0.26), lumbar spine Z-score (r=0.31), RANKL (r=-0.21), carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT, r=0.19), and sVCAM-1 (r=0.27), p<0.05. No significant correlations were detected between sclerostin and current (r=0.006) or nadir CD4 count (r=0.11). While associations between sclerostin, lumbar spine Z-score, and sVCAM-1 were robust to covariate adjustment (p<0.01), association with CIMT was no longer significant (p=0.08). Our findings provide preliminary support for a relationship between sclerostin and bone mineral density in HIV-infected persons. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway should be investigated as a potential mechanism for loss of bone mineral density in treated HIV infection.

Visceral leishmaniasis developed before full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in seven patients and at the same time as or after AIDS in the other two patients. Three patients had a history of leishmaniasis. Clinical manifestations and laboratory findings were atypical. Leishmania species were cultured from samples taken from all patients; however, six patients had an insignificant antileishmanial antibody titer and Leishmania amastigotes were not seen in their bone marrow smears. Four isolates were identified by isoenzyme analysis as Leishmania donovani infantum. Five patients died, including two patients who had completed at least one 3-week course of therapy with N-methylglucamine antimoniate. Screening should be done for visceral leishmaniasis in patients with HIV infection who live or travel in areas where the disease is endemic. The diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis may frequently be missed if cultures are not done.

The prevalence estimates vary widely among studies and may be influenced by the presence or absence of antiretroviral therapy and lipodystrophy, severity of HIV disease, and overlapping bone loss risk factors. Addressing potential underlying bone disease risk factors (e.g., smoking and alcohol intake), evaluating calcium and vitamin D intake, and performing dual x-ray absorptiometry in patients with HIV who have risks for bone disease are important strategies in preventing osteopenia and osteoporosis in HIV-infected patients. Management of osteopenia and osteoporosis is still being evaluated. Administration of bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate), with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, may be reasonable in treating osteoporosis; however, surgical intervention is the only method for treating symptomatic osteonecrosis.

The results demonstrated significantly higher undercarboxylated osteocalcin and pentosidine in PI-treated patients. Switching to integrase strand transfer inhibitor significant decreased these markers. We also showed impaired bone mechanical properties with higher undercarboxylated osteocalcin level in PI-treated mice and inhibited osteoblast differentiation in PI-treated osteogenic cells. The results confirmed the adverse effects of PIs on bone quality and osteoblast differentiation.

For that reason, resistance assays are essential to guide clinicians in the selection of optimal treatment regimens. Genotypic assays are less expensive and results are available faster than phenotypic assays. However, in heavily experienced patients with multiple treatment failures interpretation of complex mutation patterns remains difficult, and in these cases phenotypic assays are recommended. This report describes a novel recombinant virus assay where protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences derived from the plasma isolated from patients are introduced into the back-bone of an HIV molecular clone that expresses Renilla luciferase protein in the place of nef gene. All drug resistance profiles analyzed correlate with previously reported data and showed high reproducibility. This assay, in addition to a fast (completed in 10 days), precise, reproducible and automated method, presents several advantages as compared to other phenotypic assays. The system described below allows the generation of recombinant viruses with multiples cycles of replication carrying a reporter gene in their genomes. These features increase the sensitivity of the test, an important aspect to be considered in the evaluation of less fit viral isolates. In conclusion, the assay permits the quantitation of the level of resistance of clinical HIV-1 isolates to PR and RT inhibitors.

The bone marrow myoid cells were infected with 3 different strains of HIV-1, 2 strains isolated from patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HTLV-IIIB strain. To demonstrate successful infection and HIV production, culture supernatants, harvested weekly until 2 months post-infection, were tested for the presence of p24 antigen and infectious virus. Myoid cell monolayers obtained from the 3 different bone marrow samples were shown to be susceptible to infection. In particular, infection led to the presence of p24 antigen and of infectious virus in culture supernatants up to day 49 post-infection. After day 49, it was not possible to demonstrate the presence of infectious virus in culture supernatants and HIV-DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) failed to show viral genome in any of the cultures assayed. Our results demonstrate the susceptibility of myoid stromal cells to HIV infection and may provide an in vitro model for studying the effects of HIV infection in disregulation of the haemopoietic function of bone marrow environment.

Respondents were recruited from seven AIDS service organizations in New York City, and the total sample consisted of 196 HIV-infected individuals. The sample consisted largely of heterosexual, African Americans, and Latinos. Respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire that was made available in English or Spanish. Three-quarters of the sample were receiving protease inhibitor combination therapies. Overall, respondents reported a high level of life satisfaction as well as trust in their medical providers. Health worries and financial worries were the main areas of concern. A significant minority of respondents indicated reduced concern about AIDS and the need for continued safer sex practices, because of the latest treatments. Respondents with greater quality-of-life concerns were more likely to believe that AIDS was less severe now and that safer sex was less important.

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adolescents 12 to <18 years of age with CHB were randomized to tenofovir DF 300 mg (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) once daily for 72 weeks. The primary endpoint was virologic response (HBV DNA <400 copies/mL) at week 72. One hundred six patients were enrolled; 101 patients completed 72 weeks of treatment. At baseline, 91% of patients were hepatitis B e antigen-positive and 85% had prior exposure to HBV therapy. A virologic response was observed in 89% (46/52) of patients who received tenofovir DF and 0% (0/54) of patients who received placebo (P < 0.001). Treatment response was not affected by prior HBV treatment. Furthermore, no resistance to tenofovir DF developed through week 72. Among patients with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level greater than the upper limit of normal at baseline, normalization of ALT occurred in 74% of patients receiving tenofovir DF and 31% of patients receiving placebo (P < 0.001). The rate of grade 3/4 adverse events was higher among patients treated with placebo (24%) than patients treated with tenofovir DF (10%). No patients met the safety endpoint of a 6% decrease in spine bone mineral density at week 72.

Analyses were restricted to 341 patients who completed the first 28 days of therapy without dose modification. HCV RNA levels decreased in virtually all patients, but the amount of the change varied markedly. The overall 28-day decrease in HCV RNA levels was at least as predictive of a sustained virological response as the first- or second-phase viral kinetics responses. Factors associated with a smaller decrease in the HCV RNA level between baseline and day 28 included African American race, higher initial HCV RNA level, more severe hepatic fibrosis, and higher body weight. African American patients with similar 28-day decreases in viral levels as white patients were still less likely to achieve a sustained virological response. These results suggest that racial differences in the response to antiviral therapy are due to greater unresponsiveness to intracellular actions of interferon in African American individuals and that standard doses of peginterferon and ribavirin may be suboptimal for patients with higher body weights.

A macaque models of AIDS could greatly facilitate an in vivo approach to the pathogenesis of such dysfunction. Here, we evaluated in this model the impact of infection with a pathogenic simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) on bone marrow hematopoiesis. Three groups of macaques were inoculated with 50 50% median infective doses of pathogenic SHIV 89.P, which expresses env of dual-tropic HIV type 1 (HIV-1) 89.6 primary isolate. During the primary phase of infection, animals were treated with either a placebo or highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) combining zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir, initiated 4 or 72 h postinfection (p.i.) and administered twice a day until day 28 p.i. In both placebo-treated and HAART-treated animals, bone marrow colony-forming cells (CFC) progressively decreased quite early, during the first month p.i. One year p.i., both placebo- and HAART-treated animals displayed decreases in CFC to about 56% of preinfection values. At the same time, a dramatic decrease (greater than 77%) of bone marrow CD34(+) long-term culture-initiating cells was noted in all animals were found. No statistically significant differences between placebo- and HAART-treated monkeys were found. These data argue for an early and profound alteration of myelopoiesis at the level of the most primitive CD34(+) progenitor cells during SHIV infection, independently of the level of viremia, circulating CD4(+) cell counts, or antiviral treatment.

Data were analyzed from the Mothers and Infants Cohort Study, a prospective study in Brooklyn and the Bronx, New York. A total of 207 mother-infant sets were enrolled between 1986 and 1991 and followed for up to 4 years after the enrollment visit during pregnancy. HIV-1 transmission occurred in 49 of 201 mother-infant sets, yielding an overall transmission rate of 24.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 18.7% to 31.0%). Increased frequency of vaginal intercourse after the first trimester of pregnancy was positively associated with vertical transmission of HIV-1 (trend p = 0.03). A lifetime history of injection drug use was not associated with vertical transmission. However, a history of combined cocaine and heroin injection after the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with vertical HIV-1 transmission, particularly among women with CD4+ lymphocyte levels of 20% or higher (risk ratio = 4.0; 95% CI = 2.0 to 8.1). Cocaine and heroin injection drug use after the first trimester accounted for most of the relation between preterm birth and vertical HIV-1 transmission in this cohort. Maternal coinfection with hepatitis C virus or human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II could not explain these observations, because coinfection with these viruses had no detectable effect on HIV-1 transmission. These results suggest that maternal sexual behavior and injection drug use practices during the second and third trimester of pregnancy may modify the risk of vertical HIV-1 transmission.

This was a cohort study of 126 HIV-positive outpatients referred for psychiatric evaluation and treatment (average follow up of 14 months) in a HIV-dedicated primary-care outpatient clinic in the inner city. A global outcome measure (encompassing symptom relief, functioning, and HIV-risk behaviors), and a measure of abstinence from alcohol and illicit substances were used. Fifty percent of patients improved, with 19% "nearly well" at follow-up. Abstinence was achieved 48% of the time. Good compliance with treatment and the absence of injection drug use were the primary predictors of good outcomes. Of the compliant patients, 94% improved, with 45.7% being nearly well. Psychiatric treatment of HIV-infected patients is effective when located in the HIV primary-care setting and administered by a multidisciplinary team under the direction of a psychiatrist, using evidence-based interventions.

It is unknown whether HCV RNA status is associated with mortality in HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs). We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study to examine the impact of HCV RNA status on overall and cause-specific mortality in HIV-infected IDUs. We computed cumulative mortality and used Cox Regression to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRR). We identified 392 HIV-infected patients of whom 284 (72%) had chronic HCV-infection (HCV RNA positive patients) and 108 (28%) had cleared the HCV-infection (HCV RNA negative patients). During 1286 person-years of observation (PYR), 157 persons died (MR = 122/1000 PYR, 95% CI: 104-143). The estimated 5-year probabilities of survival were 0.58 (95% CI: 0.51-0.65) in the chronically HCV-infected and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.40-0.63) in the cleared HCV group. Chronic HCV-infection was not associated with overall mortality: MRR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.59-1.21. In HIV-infected Danish IDUs, chronic HCV-infection is not associated with increased mortality compared to patients who have cleared the infection.

This exploratory study examines sociodemographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, and clinical factors associated with FI in a cohort of HIV-HCV co-infected individuals in Canada. We analyzed longitudinal data from the Food Security and HIV-HCV Co-infection Study of the Canadian Co-infection Cohort collected between November 2012-June 2014 at 15 health centres. FI was measured using the Household Food Security Survey Module and classified using Health Canada criteria. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess factors associated with FI. Among 525 participants, 59 % experienced FI at their first study visit (baseline). Protective factors associated with FI (p < 0.05) included: enrolment at a Quebec study site (aOR: 0.42, 95 % CI: 0.27, 0.67), employment (aOR: 0.55, 95 % CI: 0.35, 0.87), and average personal monthly income (aOR per $100 CAD increase: 0.98, 95 % CI: 0.97, 0.99). Risk factors for FI included: recent injection drug use (aOR: 1.98, 95 % CI: 1.33, 2.96), trading away food (aOR: 5.23, 95 % CI: 2.53, 10.81), and recent experiences of depressive symptoms (aOR: 2.11, 95 % CI: 1.48, 3.01). FI is common in this co-infected population. Engagement of co-infected individuals in substance use treatments, harm reduction programs, and mental health services may mitigate FI in this vulnerable subset of the HIV-positive population.

Incarcerated persons who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected often have multiple risk factors associated with initial incarceration and recidivism, in particular, injection drug use. Yet, some jails provide case management for HIV-infected inmates to provide continuity of health care, which might have positive effects on reentry into the community. We sought to measure recidivism and factors related to recidivism in an HIV-infected cohort in an urban county jail with an active case management program. Fifty-two inmates surveyed in 1999 at the San Francisco County Jail were followed for rearrests through 2006. In follow-up, 73% were re-incarcerated on an average of 6.8 times for 552 days. Risk factors included nonwhite ethnicity, history of homelessness and crack use, common risk factors for incarceration. Less than high school education was associated with recidivism, shorter time to reincarceration, and more incarcerations. HIV-infected inmates spend a high proportion of time in multiple incarcerations, a reflection of the cyclical nature of incarceration despite comprehensive case management. Well-known risk factors for incarceration were associated with recidivism; in addition, lack of high school education played a prominent role. Education should be explored as a way to make further progress on breaking the cycle of incarceration.

Presence of e antigen was associated with increases in DNA polymerase activity and in the number of circulating Dane particles. In the group with detectable e antigen, the average DNA polymerase activity was 367+/-78 counts per minute (cpm; mean+/-standard error [SE]), and the average number of Dane particles counted in electron micrographs was 4.4% of the total HBS Ag. In contrast, e antigen-negative patients had an average DNA polymerase activity of 40+/-6.9 cpm (P less than 0.1) and an average Dane particle count equal to 0.6% of the HBS Ag. The e antigen was detected in 68% of patients who were HBS Ag carriers or had persistent viral hepatitis and 40% of those with chronic active type B hepatitis. Thus, the presence of e antigen correlated with both the chronicity and presence of infectious HBV. However, it did not correlate with the type or severity of liver disease after HBV infection, since e antigen was present in both chronic benign and chronic aggressive hepatitis B infections.

Although most studies report beneficial effects in terms of behavior modification, a direct assessment of the effectiveness of NEPs in preventing HIV infection has been lacking. A cohort study was conducted to assess the association between risk behaviors and HIV seroprevalence and seroincidence among injection drug users in Montreal, Canada. The association between NEP use and HIV infection was examined in three risk assessment scenarios using intensive covariate adjustment for empirical confounders: a cross-sectional analysis of NEP use at entry as a determinant of seroprevalence, a cohort analysis of NEP use at entry as a predictor of subsequent seroconversion, and a nested case-control analysis of NEP participation during follow-up as a predictor of seroconversion. From September 1988 to January 1995, 1,599 subjects were enrolled with a baseline seroprevalence of 10.7%. The mean follow-up period was 21.7 months. The adjusted odds ratio for HIV seroprevalence in injection drug users reporting recent NEP use was 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.5-3.2). In the cohort study, there were 89 incident cases of HIV infection with a cumulative probability of HIV seroconversion of 33% for NEP users and 13% for nonusers (p < 0.0001). In the nested case-control study, consistent NEP use was associated with HIV seroconversion during follow-up (odds ratio = 10.5, 95% confidence interval 2.7-41.0). Risk elevations for HIV infection associated with NEP attendance were substantial and consistent in all three risk assessment scenarios in our cohort of injection drug users, despite extensive adjustment for confounders. In summary, in Montreal, NEP users appear to have higher seroconversion rates then NEP nonusers.

However, despite this progress in therapeutic control, including undetectable viral loads and CD4+ T-cell counts in the normal range, viral mutations continue to accumulate in the peripheral blood compartment over time, indicating either low level reactivation and/or replication. Using patients from the Drexel Medicine CNS AIDS Research and Eradication Study (CARES) Cohort, whom have been sampled longitudinally for more than 7 years, genetic change was modeled against to the dominant integrated proviral quasispecies with respect to selection pressures such as therapeutic interventions, AIDS defining illnesses, and other factors. Phylogenetic methods based on the sequences of the LTR and tat exon 1 of the HIV-1 proviral DNA quasispecies were used to obtain an estimate of an average mutation rate of 5.3 nucleotides (nt)/kilobasepair (kb)/year (yr) prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Following ART the baseline mutation rate was reduced to an average of 1.02 nt/kb/yr. The post-ART baseline rate of genetic change, however, appears to be unique for each patient. These studies represent our initial steps in quantifying rates of genetic change among HIV-1 quasispecies using longitudinally sampled sequences from patients at different stages of disease both before and after initiation of combination ART. Notably, while long-term ART reduced the estimated mutation rates in the vast majority of patients studied, there was still measurable HIV-1 mutation even in patients with no detectable virus by standard quantitative assays. Determining the factors that affect HIV-1 mutation rates in the peripheral blood may lead to elucidation of the mechanisms associated with changes in HIV-1 disease severity.

This study was conducted among street-recruited injection drug users (IDUs) from Buenos Aires, with the aim of estimating seroprevalence and coinfection of HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs). A total of 174 volunteers participated in this study; 137 were men (78.7% of volunteers). The average age of the participants was 30 years. Only 64 of participants (37%) had no viral infection, whereas 110 (63%) were infected with > or =1 viruses. Seroprevalences were 44.3% for HIV, 54.6% for HCV, 42.5% for HBV, 2.3% for HTLV-I, and 14.5% for HTLV-II. Among the 77 HIV-infected persons, only 6.5% (5 persons) were not coinfected with other viruses; 88.3% (68) were coinfected with HCV and 68.8% (53) were coinfected with HBV. We demonstrated the existence of multiple viral infections with a high rate of prevalence in IDUs in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

We performed a cross-sectional study of the National Health Examination and Nutrition Study (1999-2010). Chronic HCV-infected patients had detectable HCV RNA. Low muscle mass was defined as <10th percentile for mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of low muscle mass associated with chronic HCV. Among 18 513 adults, chronic HCV-infected patients (n = 303) had a higher prevalence of low muscle mass than uninfected persons (13.8% vs 6.7%; aOR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.39-3.56), and this association remained when analyses were repeated among persons without significant liver fibrosis (aOR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.30-3.47). This study demonstrates that chronic HCV infection is associated with low muscle mass, as assessed by MUAC measurements, even in the absence of advanced liver disease.

Thirteen patients with HCV-associated myopathy have been reported previously. In most of these cases, varying degrees of inflammatory changes were observed in the muscle tissue. In 2 patients, myopathy developed after initiation of interferon therapy for chronic HCV hepatitis. Our case was unusual due to long-standing elevation of creatine kinase values which improved following interferon therapy and the non-inflammatory features of the muscle tissue where the HCV RNA minus strand, a marker for replicative intermediates of the virus, was undetectable. The association of myopathy with HCV infection might represent a unique clinical entity, although the underlying pathological mechanisms remain unknown.

Androgen deficiency in HIV-infected patients is associated with decreased muscle mass and function, and adverse disease outcome. Administration of replacement doses of testosterone to healthy hypogonadal men augments lean body mass, muscle size, and maximal voluntary strength. Recent studies have shown that physiologic testosterone replacement in HIV-infected men with weight loss who have low testosterone levels can also increase muscle mass and effort-dependent strength. However, further studies are needed to determine whether androgen therapy can improve physical function and health-related outcomes in HIV-infected men.

In patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), wasting, particularly loss of metabolically active lean tissue, has been associated with increased mortality, accelerated disease progression, loss of muscle protein mass, and impairment of strength and functional status. Factors that may contribute to wasting include inadequate intake, malabsorptive disorders, metabolic alterations, hypogonadism, and excessive cytokine production. Evidence now demonstrates that nutritional counseling and support, appetite stimulants, progressive resistance training, and anabolic hormones can reverse weight loss and increase lean body mass in HIV-infected patients. Despite a growing body of evidence on the importance of nutritional intervention to prevent wasting in adults, maintain growth velocity in children, and promote restoration of weight and lean body mass in stable, low-weight patients, no therapeutic guidelines currently exist for the management of weight loss and wasting in HIV-infected patients. Principles and guidelines for assessment and management of weight loss and wasting in patients with HIV/AIDS are presented.

Factors which influence spontaneous HCV clearance remain to be identified. The purpose of the present study was to identify variables associated with spontaneous HCV clearance in a referred population of Chinese patients. The prevalence of host, viral, and environmental factors known to influence the outcome of HCV infections was compared in 92 HCV spontaneous clearance subjects and 318 HCV persistent infection subjects. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify those factors associated with spontaneous HCV clearance. In univariate analysis, female gender, a history of icteric hepatitis, serologic evidence of concurrent HBV infection, and rs12979860 CC genotype were positively associated with spontaneous HCV clearance, while alcohol consumption was negatively associated with clearance. In multivariate analysis, female gender, a history of icteric hepatitis, concurrent HBV infection, and rs12979860 CC genotype remained independent variables associated with spontaneous HCV clearance. Spontaneous HCV clearance is more likely to occur in females, subjects with a history of icteric hepatitis, HBV coinfections, and those with the rs12979860 CC genotype.

When he was 53 years old, he developed oral candidiasis and serum human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA was detected. After starting highly active antiretroviral therapy, serum HIV RNA became undetectable. Neurological examination revealed ptosis and bulbar symptoms. Myasthenia gravis was comfirmed by a positive edrophonium test, showing 20% decrement of the compound muscle action potential on repetitive stimulation. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies were negative and anti-muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies were positive. The chest CT scan was normal. He experienced transient clinical remission with pyridostigmine bromide and prednisolone. However relapse occurred after he returned to work. Persistent clinical remission was first observed after cyclosporin administration. There are eleven reports in which patients had concomitant myasthenia gravis and HIV infection. Most of those cases were benign in clinical course and required only anticholinesterase therapy. In our case, however, anti-MuSK antibodies were positive, and symptoms of myasthenia gravis remained despite prednisolone administration. Cyclosporin is directly active against HIV, and thus, cyclosporine therapy may be helpful in patients with concomitant myasthenia gravis and HIV infection.

The population pharmacokinetics of EVG in treatment-naive and -experienced HIV patients was determined, and the effects of demographic, biometric, and formulation covariates on EVG pharmacokinetics (PK) were evaluated. Data from 31 clinical studies (25 in healthy subjects, 6 phase 1b to phase 3 in HIV-1-infected patients) with COBI-boosted EVG studies (as EVG/co or EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF single-tablet regimen) or RTV-boosted EVG studies (EVG/r) were analyzed using NONMEM. The effect of the covariates age, sex, race, health status (healthy volunteers vs HIV patients), weight, body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), creatinine clearance (estimated GFR), and formulation were evaluated. EVG PK, with COBI or RTV, was described by a 2-compartment model, with first-order absorption and elimination and an absorption lag time. A statistically significant, but not clinically relevant, effect of BSA on EVG clearance (CL) was observed. Coadministration of atazanavir or lopinavir with EVG/r had an effect on EVG CL consistent with the known interaction with these agents. No other covariate had a meaningful effect on EVG PK. EVG PK was well described in a population PK model with HIV-infected patients, with low PK variability and no relevant effect of demographic or biometric covariates.

Presarcopenia and sarcopenia precede age-associated physical disability. We investigated their prevalence and the predictive value of patient mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) for them. Eighty community-dwelling patients ≥45 years old demonstrating durable viral suppression were evaluated. Sarcopenia was defined as low skeletal muscle index (SMI, skeletal muscle kg/height m(2)) and either low strength or poor performance by handgrip dynamometry and gait speed, respectively. Presarcopenia was defined as low SMI only. MUAC was interpreted according to National Health Statistics percentile. Prevalence of sarcopenia and presarcopenia was 5.0% and 20.0%, respectively. Male gender (odds ratio [OR] 10.72; P < .026), recreational psychoactive substance use (OR 5.13; P < .037), and intravenous drug use transmission category (OR 6.94; P <.0327) were associated with presarcopenia. Higher body mass index (OR 0.80; P < .0007), MUAC (OR 0.83; P < .024), and large skeletal frame (OR 0.09; P < .003) were negatively associated with presarcopenia. Finding that a participant did not have a MUAC <25th percentile on physical examination had a 90.4% negative predictive value for presarcopenia. Although sarcopenia was uncommon, presarcopenia was highly prevalent in midlife and older HIV-infected males. Determination of MUAC percentile may identify those least likely to demonstrate skeletal muscle deficit and improve patient selection for mass and function testing.

Standardized data were collected from patients at the time of TB diagnosis, two months into TB treatment, and at completion of TB treatment. We calculated composite physical and mental health scores for patients that completed treatment, compared scores during treatment, and analyzed factors associated with improvements in these scores. Of 493 patients analyzed, 488 (99%) reported at least one physical health complaint and 210 (43%) had at least one mental health complaint at baseline. Improvement in physical health occurred in 377 (76%) and improvement in mental health occurred in 182 (37%). In a multivariable analysis, factors strongly associated with improvement in physical health were receiving TB treatment in Bangkok, age greater than 50 years, and improved mental health. Improvement in mental health was strongly associated with alleviation of physical symptoms, including bloody urine, foot pain, headache, muscle weakness, difficulty sleeping, chest pain, and dizziness.

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly improved survival in HIV patients but not without uncovering new and unique manifestations of disease. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is a collection of inflammatory disorders in which a pathologic inflammatory response and clinical deterioration occur during recovery of the immune system after HAART. To our knowledge, a correlation between immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and HIV-associated myocarditis has not been described previously. We report a case of acute myocarditis presenting with refractory ventricular arrhythmias in a patient with AIDS who experienced rapid immune recovery with the initiation of HAART. The case underscores the importance of recognizing this potential complication of AIDS treatment and calls for renewed vigilance concerning cardiac manifestations of HIV, especially during the immune reconstitution phase.

Nonadherence may lead to development of resistant strains that may further increase the costs of management. The aim of this study was to compare the level of adherence to ART among internally displaced persons (IDPs) and non-IDPs and determine the factors associated with nonadherence. A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to February 2008 among adults receiving ART from Lacor Hospital. Systematic sampling was used to select 200 participants. Adherence was assessed through patients' self-reports over a 4-day period. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and analyzed in SPSS version 12 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Patients were considered to be adherent if they took 95% or more of their medicines. Adherence rates among IDP and non-IDP patients were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Factors associated with nonadherence were determined using logistic regression. The overall mean 4-day adherence was 99.5%. There was no significant difference in adherence between IDPs and non-IDPs (99.6% and 99.5%, respectively). Being on first-line regimen of ART (odds ratio [OR] = 22.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.48-333.33) and feeling that staff at the health centre were condemning (OR = 22.22, 1.53-333.33) were independently associated with nonadherence. Our study was limited in using only self-reports to assess adherence. In conclusion, patients in conflict areas can achieve high levels of adherence. Interventions to reduce nonadherence should address health provider-patient interaction and patients on first-line regimens.

Therefore, the association of single nucleotide polymorphism of interleukin (IL)-18 promoter region in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was examined. The results demonstrated the significant involvement of genotype A/A at position -607 in patients (n = 140) when compared with healthy individuals (n = 140) [OR (95% CI) = 2.62 (1.36-5.09), P(c)= 0.009]. The frequencies of -607A/A, C/A, C/C genotypes were 27.86%, 48.57% and 23.57% in chronic HBV patients and 12.80%, 59.30% and 27.90% in healthy controls, respectively. No significant association at the position -137 was found between the two groups. The frequencies of -607A/-137G haplotype homozygosity were higher in the chronic HBV patients (17.14%) than in the controls (8.57%) [OR (95% CI) = 2.21 (1-4.93), P = 0.05], although this was not statistically significant when corrected for multiple comparison (P(c)= 0.40). In conclusion, this study proposes that A/A genotype at position -607 in IL-18 gene can be used as a new genetic maker in Thai population for predicting chronic hepatitis B development.
=> 3th document retrieved: Order: 4134, Title: The individualized genetic barrier predicts treatment response in a large cohort of HIV-1 infected patients., Abstract: The success of combination antiretroviral therapy is limited by the evolutionary escape dynamics of HIV-1. We used Isotonic Conjunctive Bayesian Networks (I-CBNs), a class of probabilistic graphical models, to describe this process. We employed partial order constraints among viral resistance mutations, which give rise to a limited set of mutational pathways, and we modeled phenotypic drug resistance as monotonically increasing along any escape pathway. Using this model, the individualized genetic barrier (IGB) to each drug is derived as the probability of the virus not acquiring additional mutations that confer resistance. Drug-specific IGBs were combined to obtain the IGB to an entire regimen, which quantifies the virus' genetic potential for developing drug resistance under combination therapy. The IGB was tested as a predictor of therapeutic outcome using between 2,185 and 2,631 treatment change episodes of subtype B infected patients from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study Database, a large observational cohort. Using logistic regression, significant univariate predictors included most of the 18 drugs and single-drug IGBs, the IGB to the entire regimen, the expert rules-based genotypic susceptibility score (GSS), several individual mutations, and the peak viral load before treatment change. In the multivariate analysis, the only genotype-derived variables that remained significantly associated with virological success were GSS and, with 10-fold stronger association, IGB to regimen. When predicting suppression of viral load below 400 cps/ml, IGB outperformed GSS and also improved GSS-containing predictors significantly, but the difference was not significant for suppression below 50 cps/ml. Thus, the IGB to regimen is a novel data-derived predictor of treatment outcome that has potential to improve the interpretation of genotypic drug resistance tests.

AIDS-related stigma and conflict may create distress and deteriorate quality of life (QoL) of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). This cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study using structural questionnaires aimed to explore the stress, needs, QoL, and associated factors of PLWHA in Taiwan. A total of 200 PLWHA participating in this study needed most on treatment of HIV and prevention of AIDS, and health maintenance. They had worse QoL in physical, psychological, and social domains (all p < 0.001) than the general population. Stress was the most significant predictor (β = -0.25 to -0.54, p < 0.01) for all four domains of QoL. Needs was not significantly associated with QoL. The QoL of PLWHA can be explained by demographics, self-perception on health, needs, and stress for 25.3-40.7% of variances. No association existed between CD4(+) counts and QoL in Taiwanese PLWHA. It is important to recognize the perception of PLWHA on their health status, which is significantly associated with their QoL, besides monitoring their physical indicators of health (CD4(+) counts). To recognize the stress and needs that PLWHA experience and to develop intervention programs targeting strategies on HIV disclosure, prevention and health maintenance are crucial for PLWHA's QoL.

In addition, several clinical studies have suggested that one dosage regimen may be active in patients with HIV infection. We conducted a randomized, controlled dose response study of intravenous DTC in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex (ARC). Drug associated toxicities included gastrointestinal upset, burning at the infusion site, metallic taste, sneezing, confusional states, hyperactivity, delusional thinking, and myoclonus. Toxicity was ameliorated by dose reduction. The maximally tolerated dose varied for individual patients from 200 mg/m2 weekly to 800 mg/m2 twice weekly. No myelosuppression was observed. In patients with greater than 200 CD4+ cells/uL, a statistically significant reduction of lymphadenopathy occurred; whereas no beneficial effects were observed in patients with less than 200 CD4+ cells/uL. Improvement in symptom score and stabilization of CD4+ count also occurred in the treated group, although these trends did not reach statistical significance. Further controlled clinical trials of DTC in earlier HIV infection are warranted.

Generally these models aim to capture and predict the on-treatment viral load dynamics from a small study of individual patients. Here, we explored extending these models (1) to clinical studies with numerous patients and (2) by incorporating additional data types, including sequence data and prior response to interferon. Data from Phase 3 clinical studies of the direct-acting antiviral telaprevir (T; total daily dose of 2250 mg) combined with pegylated-interferon alfa and ribavirin (PR) were used for the analysis. The following data in the treatment-naïve population were reserved to verify the model: (1) a T/PR regimen where T was dosed every 8 h for 8 weeks (T8(q8h)/PR) and (2) a T/PR regimen where T was dosed twice daily for 12 weeks (T12(b.i.d.)/PR). The resulting model accurately predicted (1) sustained virologic response rates for both of these dosing regimens and (2) viral breakthrough characteristics of the T8(q8h)/PR regimen. Since the observed viral variants depend on the T exposure, the second verification suggested that the model was correctly sensitive to the different T regimen even though the model was developed using data from another T regimen. Furthermore, the model predicted that b.i.d. T dosing was comparable to q8h T dosing in the PR-experienced population, a comparison that has not been made in a controlled clinical study. The methods developed in this work to estimate the variability occurring below the limit of detection for the viral load were critical for making accurate predictions.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether HIV-infected patients who use a tenofovir-based regimen are at increased risk of tubular dysfunction. We conducted an observational, comparative, longitudinal, prospective study. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and markers of tubular damage to assess tubular dysfunction (fractional excretion of phosphate and uric acid, glycosuria, and proteinuria) were measured at baseline and at weeks 12 and 24. Of 111 participants, PRTD was found in 6.3% at week 12 and 9% at week 24, with no statistically significant difference between those on an abacavir (ABC)-containing regimen or a TDF-containing regimen. We also found an increase in triglycerides associated with the ABC-containing regimen compared with the TDF group. The use of an ABC- or TDF-containing regimen was independently associated with tubular dysfunction, but we found no significant differences between these groups, except when TDF was combined with a protease inhibitor. A better and more complete assessment of renal function is needed, because the presence of tubular dysfunction and proteinuria without impairment of eGFR may affect the renal safety of HIV-infected patients.

The occurrence of cardiovascular events in HIV-infected patients has often been associated with treatment-induced dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and body composition changes. These treatment-related complications are often the result of exposures to protease inhibitors or thymidine analogs such as stavudine or zidovudine. Recent investigations, however, have suggested an association between exposure to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, abacavir, and the occurrence of cardiovascular disease events. Based on these findings, current guidelines recommend using caution in patients receiving abacavir who are at a high risk for cardiovascular disease. Decisions to replace abacavir in a patient's regimen should be considered on an individual basis and with complete evaluation of the associated benefits and risks. Furthermore, additional studies are necessary to definitively determine the association between abacavir exposure and the occurrence of cardiovascular disease events. Studies are also necessary to definitively identify the contributions of both HIV infection and individual antiretroviral agents on the development of cardiovascular disease.

This study reviews the roles of genetic polymorphisms, HIV-1 infection, and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in lipid metabolism. Lipid abnormalities can vary according to the HAART regimen, such as those with protease inhibitors (PIs). However, genetic factors may also be involved in dyslipidemia because not all patients receiving the same HAART regimen and with comparable demographic, virological, and immunological characteristics develop variations in the lipid profile. Polymorphisms in a large number of genes are involved in the synthesis of structural proteins, and enzymes related to lipid metabolism account for variations in the lipid profile of each individual. As some genetic polymorphisms may cause dyslipidemia, these allele variants should be investigated in HIV-1-infected patients to identify individuals with an increased risk of developing dyslipidemia during treatment with HAART, particularly during therapy with PIs. This knowledge may guide individualized treatment decisions and lead to the development of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of dyslipidemia in these patients.

This qualitative study investigated the barriers and facilitators to cART adherence among Peruvian adolescents living with HIV. Guided by a social ecological model, we analyzed transcripts from 24 psychosocial support groups for HIV-positive adolescents aged 13-17 years and 15 individual, in-depth interviews with cART providers and caregivers to identify the barriers and facilitators to cART adherence at the individual, family/caregiver and hospital levels. Most barriers and facilitators to cART adherence clustered at the individual and family/caregiver levels, centering on support provided to adolescents; history of declining health due to suboptimal cART adherence; side effects from antiretroviral drugs; and cART misinformation. Interventions to support adolescent HIV cART adherence should begin at the individual and family/caregiver levels and include an educational component. No adolescent living with HIV should die from AIDS in an era of accessible cART.

Given the high prevalence of depression in chronic HIV patients, there is a clear need for further research into the determinants of depression in this population. In order to comprehensively study the predictors of depressive symptoms in HIV patients on ART, the socio-ecological theory postulates to not only incorporate the dominant individual-level and the more recent community-level approaches, but also incorporate the intermediate, but crucial family-level approach. The present study aims to extend the current literature by simultaneously investigating the impact of a wide range individual-level, family-level and community-level determinants of depression in a sample of 435 patients enrolled in the Free State Province of South Africa public-sector ART program. Structural equation modeling is used to explore the relationships between both latent and manifest variables at two time points. Besides a number of individual-level correlates-namely education, internalized and external stigma, and avoidant and seeking social support coping styles-of depressive symptoms in HIV patients on ART, the study also revealed the important role of family functioning in predicting depression. While family attachment emerged as the only factor to continuously and negatively impact depression at both time points, the second dimension of family functioning, changeability, was the only factor to produce a negative cross-lagged effect on depression. The immediate and long-term impact of family functioning on depression draws attention to the role of family dynamics in the mental health of people living with HIV/AIDS. In addition to individual-level and community-based factors, future research activities should also incorporate the role of the family context in research into the mental health of HIV patients, as our results demonstrate that the familial context in which a person with HIV on ART resides is inextricably interconnected with his/her health outcomes.

The pharmacokinetics of transdermally administered testosterone in premenopausal women and HIV-infected women have not been studied. In this study we compared the pharmacokinetics of a novel testosterone matrix transdermal system (TMTDS) in healthy premenopausal women and women infected with HIV. Eight menstruating HIV-infected women, 18-50 yr of age, who had been receiving stable antiretroviral therapy, including a protease inhibitor, for at least 12 weeks and nine healthy, menstruating women of comparable age were enrolled. After baseline sampling during a 24-h control period in the early follicular phase (days 1-6), two TMTDS patches were applied with an expected delivery rate of 300 microg testosterone daily over an application period of 3-4 days. After 72 h, the patches were removed, a second set of two patches was applied, and blood samples were drawn over 96 h. Baseline serum total and free testosterone levels were lower in HIV-infected women than in healthy women. A diurnal rhythm of testosterone secretion, with higher levels in the morning and lower levels in the late afternoon, was apparent in both groups of women. Free testosterone levels were in the midnormal range at baseline in healthy women and increased above the upper limit of normal during TMTDS application. In HIV-infected women, free testosterone levels were in the low normal range at baseline and rose into the upper normal range during patch application. Serum total testosterone levels increased into the midnormal range in HIV-infected women and into the upper normal range in healthy women during patch application. The mean increments in free and total testosterone levels were significantly lower in HIV-infected women than in healthy women. Testosterone bioavailability, expressed as the mean +/- SEM baseline-subtracted area under the total testosterone curve, was significantly greater in healthy women than in HIV-infected women [3323 +/- 566 ng/dL x h (115 +/- 20 nmol/L x h) vs. 1506 +/- 316 ng/dL x h (52 +/- 11 nmol/ L x h); P = 0.016]. Assuming a daily testosterone delivery rate of 300 microg/day, the apparent plasma clearance was significantly higher in HIV-infected women than in healthy women (2531 +/- 469 vs. 1127 +/- 217 L/day1 P = 0.022), respectively. There was no significant change from baseline in serum LH, sex hormone-binding globulin, and estradiol levels in either group. Serum FSH levels showed a greater decrease from baseline in healthy women. A regimen of two testosterone patches applied twice a week can maintain serum total and free testosterone levels in the mid- to upper normal range, respectively, in HIV-infected women with low testosterone levels. During TMTDS application, the increments in serum total and free testosterone levels are lower in HIV-infected women than in healthy women, presumably due to increased plasma clearance or decreased absorption. Further studies are needed to assess the effects of physiological androgen replacement in HIV-infected women.

However, there is limited information available on estrogens and their function in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pituitary and testicular endocrine markers: 14 HIV-positive men were included into the longitudinal study with a follow up to of 18 month period. None of the patients had a history or clinical evidence of endocrine dysfunction. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin, estrone, estradiol, and testosterone were measured in serum by commercially available radioimmunoassays. Prolactin levels were not affected in the patients. LH and FSH remained within normal range, but at the end of the study period we observed a significant increase of LH (p < 0.05). In addition, testosterone levels were normal with a slight reduction at the end of the 18-month observation period (p <0.05). Both estrone and estradiol were significantly increased with a further rise at the end of the study (p <0.05). In summary, the elevation of the serum estrone and estradiol in HIV-afflicted patients correlated with the progress of the HIV-disease, being paralleled by a decrease in testosterone. The altered relation of estrogens and testosterone may in a part be responsible for the complaints of decreased libido and increased impotence often observed in HIV-infected men.

Hypogonadism is prevalent in advanced HIV disease, however, low testosterone levels have not been customarily implicated in HIV-associated anemia. This study was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between testosterone levels and androgen use with anemia in HIV, and to characterize other clinical correlates of HIV-associated anemia. This was a cross-sectional, observational study of 200 HIV-positive patients at a public hospital HIV clinic from July 2000 to August 2001. A written questionnaire detailed previous and current medication use, opportunistic infections, and malignancies. Hematological and virological parameters, testosterone, and erythropoietin levels were measured; CD4(+) T lymphocyte count and viral load nadir and peak levels were obtained from the computerized medical record. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin <13.5 g/dl in men and <11.6 g/dl in women. Twenty-four percent of women and 28% of men were anemic. Anemia was associated with lymphopenia (adjusted OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.36-11.80), high erythropoietin levels (adjusted OR 7.73, 95% CI 2.92-20.48), and low testosterone levels (adjusted OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.01-10.60). Anemia was negatively associated with female sex (adjusted OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.85), current antiretroviral therapy (adjusted OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20-0.95), current androgen use (adjusted OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.84), and macrocytosis (adjusted OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.61). Low testosterone levels may have a positive association and supplemental androgens a negative association with anemia in HIV disease.

In a cultural setting where family relationships are highly valued and contribute critically to well-being, such self-isolation can thwart HIV self-management and engagement in medical care, and so heighten risk for health disparities. To understand this phenomenon, we conducted individual in-depth interviews with 34 persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLwHA) in Shanghai and Beijing. Inductive content analysis revealed a range of forms of self-isolation motivation, beliefs, and behaviors influenced by: 1) internalized stigma and desire to avoid discrimination; 2) HIV-related factors such as HIV knowledge and disease progression; and 3) familial factors such as a sense of responsibility and family members' reactions. Based on a proposed framework centering on dialectical family influences (whereby PLwHA are pushed away from, yet pulled toward the family fold), implications for provision of multidisciplinary care in medical settings are considered, including culturally appropriate strategies to decrease health disparities.

Despite this, the origin of seminal HIV particles remains unclear, as does the question of whether the male genital tract organs contribute virus to semen. Here we investigated the presence of HIV receptors within the human testis using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We also analyzed the infectivity of a dual tropic HIV-1 strain in an organotypic culture, as well as the impact of viral exposure on testosterone production. Our study establishes that CXCR4+, CCR5+, CD4+, and DC-SIGN+ cells are present within the interstitial tissue of human testis and that these molecules persist throughout our organotypic culture. Our data also reveal that the human testis is permissive to HIV-1 and supports productive infection, leaving testosterone production apparently unaffected. Infected cells appeared to be testicular macrophages located within the interstitial tissue. That the testis itself represents a potential source of virus in semen could play a role in preventing viral eradication from semen because this organ constitutes a pharmacological sanctuary for many current antiretrovirals.

However, this possibility has not been prospectively assessed during an AIDS virus infection. We determined V(H) family usage in rhesus monkeys during primary infection with chimeric viruses expressing HIV-1 envelopes on a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) backbone (SHIVs). Four SHIVs with different envelopes and pathogenicities were studied. V(H) family usage was prospectively assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymph node cells of these monkeys by a semiquantitative PCR technique. In the first months following SHIV infection, a period of intense viral antigenemia, representation of various V(H) families increased or decreased for individual monkeys, but no single V(H) family was consistently altered. In particular, the average representation of V(H)3-bearing B lymphocytes did not change. This observation suggests that the envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 does not selectively expand or deplete the V(H)3 repertoire of primate B cells during acute AIDS virus infection, contrary to predictions of the gp120 superantigen hypothesis.

Preventive HBV vaccination is less effective in HIV-infected patients than in those without HIV infection. Emtricitabine, lamivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir) each have activity against HIV and HBV. In HBV/HIV-coinfected patients, if HBV or HIV treatment is needed, it should be initiated with tenofovir and emtricitabine or tenofovir and lamivudine as the nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone of a fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen. If HBV treatment is needed and tenofovir cannot be used safely, entecavir is recommended in addition to a fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen. Initiation of treatment for HBV infection is based on the presence of cirrhosis and on HBV DNA level, alanine aminotransferase level, and biopsy results. Current HBV treatments are associated with low functional cure rates. This article summarizes a presentation by Kenneth E. Sherman, MD, PhD, at the IAS-USA continuing education program held in San Francisco, California, in March 2015.

Many studies have been undertaken on factors affecting adherence to ART; however, there is little information about Laos. Hence, this qualitative study examines barriers to and facilitators of adherence specific to this context. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were undertaken with 43 people living with HIV (PLHIV) currently on ART across 2 hospitals in Laos: Setthathirath hospital in the capital Vientiane and Savannakhet Province hospital. Interviews were based on semistructured question guides and were undertaken in Lao, translated into English and audio-recorded for later analysis. Major barriers to adherence reported by participants included transport costs, distance to the hospital, and stigma and discrimination. Key facilitators discussed were the perceived benefits of medication, social support, and the acceptance of HIV status.

In this paper, we describe a system that manages and shares antiretroviral therapy information of 4438 HIV patients in three healthcare centers in Hanoi capital of Vietnam. The overall design considerations, architecture and the integration of centralized database and decentralized management for the system are also presented. The findings from this study can serve as a guide to consider in the implementation model of health care to manage and share information of patients not only in HIV infection, but also in the other chronic and non-communicable diseases.

This study assessed the link between social capital, operationally defined in terms of social networks (group-based and personal social networks) and access to network resources (access to material and non-material resources and social support) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among 554 (55% female) adults on HIV treatment through South Africa's public health system. Female study participants were involved with more group-based social networks but had fewer personal social networks in comparison to males. Access to network resources was higher among females and those from larger households but lower among older study participants. Experience of social support significantly increased with household economic status and duration at current residence. Social capital indicators were unrelated to HIV disease status indicators, including duration since diagnosis, CD4 count and viral load. Only a minority (13%) of study participants took part in groups formed by and for predominantly PLHIV (HIV support groups), and participation in such groups was unrelated to their mental or physical health. Personal rather than group-linked social networks and access to network resources were significantly associated with mental but not physical health, after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. The findings of limited participation in HIV support groups and that the participation in such groups was not significantly associated with physical or mental health may suggest efforts among PLHIV in South Africa to normalise HIV as a chronic illness through broad-based rather than HIV-status bounded social participation, as a strategy for deflecting stigma. Further research is required to examine the effects of HIV treatment on social networking and participation among PLHIV within both rural and other urban settings of South Africa.

The projects included a variety of cross-sectional exploratory studies, situation analyses, and longitudinal randomized, controlled intervention studies that examined service delivery, community awareness, health-seeking behaviors, adherence, cost, and other factors affecting treatment for adults and children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This article summarizes the key findings and lessons learned from these projects, and examines cross-cutting issues such as stigma, quality of life, and sexual-risk behaviors among people living with HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome on antiretroviral therapy. The article concludes with recommendations for evidence-based programming and future research around treatment for both children and adults.

The submitted clinical evidence included two international randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing tenofovir with adefovir, and a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) using Bayesian methodology to compare tenofovir with other nucleos(t)ide analogues using direct and indirect RCT evidence. There were no statistically significant differences between tenofovir and adefovir in overall adverse events although, in hepatitis B 'e' antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients, there was a higher incidence of mild nausea in the tenofovir treatment group. The primary outcome, 'complete response', was a composite end point defined as histology response and hepatitis B virus DNA below 400 copies/ml. For both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients, a significantly greater proportion had a complete response after 48 weeks with tenofovir than with adefovir. There was no statistically significant difference in histological response in either group of patients compared with adefovir. The MTC could only generate results for HBeAg positive nucleos(t)ide naive patients as there was insufficient evidence for other subgroups. The probability of achieving undetectable HBV DNA with tenofovir was found to be significantly higher than that for all other treatments considered in the analysis at the 0.05 level. The analysis demonstrated that there is a 98% probability that tenofovir is the most potent nucleos(t)ide in terms of this outcome. The manufacturer's submission concluded that tenofovir is a cost-effective option as first-line treatment. For HBeAg-positive patients, tenofovir followed by lamivudine has an incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) of 9940 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, compared with lamivudine followed by tenofovir. A more appropriate treatment strategy of tenofovir followed by tenofovir plus lamivudine has an ICER of 13,619 pounds per QALY gained, compared with lamivudine followed by tenofovir. For HBeAg-negative patients, tenofovir followed by lamivudine has an ICER of 9811 pounds per QALY gained, compared with best supportive care. A more clinically appropriate treatment strategy of tenofovir followed by tenofovir plus lamivudine has an ICER of 13,854 pounds per QALY gained, compared with tenofovir followed by lamivudine. The ERG uncovered a number of errors in the submission and these ICERs approximately doubled when the analysis was corrected and reran. The guidance issued by NICE on 22 July 2009 states that tenofovir disoproxil, within its marketing authorization is recommended as an option for the treatment of people with chronic HBe-Ag-positive or HBe-Ag-negative hepatitis B in whom antiviral treatment is indicated.

The combination of pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) was recommended as the treatment of choice for chronic hepatitis C for nearly a decade. In 2011 the directly acting antivirals (DAA) HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, were approved to treat HCV-genotype-1 infection, each in triple combination with Peg-IFN and RBV. These treatments allowed higher rates of SVR than the double Peg-IFN + RBV, but the low tolerability and high pill burden of these triple regimes were responsible for reduced adherence and early treatment discontinuation. The second and third wave DAAs introduced in 2013-2014 enhanced the efficacy and tolerability of anti-HCV treatment. Consequently, the traditional indicators for disease management and predictors of treatment response should be revised in light of these new therapeutic options. This review article will focus on the use of the markers of HCV infection and replication, of laboratory and instrumental data to define the stage of the disease and of predictors, if any, of response to therapy in the DAA era. The article is addressed particularly to physicians who have patients with hepatitis C in care in their everyday clinical practice.

The incidence of AIDS was calculated in the general population and examined further according to gender, age (< or = or >49 years), and heterosexual behaviour as a risk factor for HIV. Multivariate analysis was used to identify variables associated with AIDS presenters (defined as patients diagnosed with AIDS within 1 month of the first HIV-positive test). The numbers of patients with AIDS classified as (i) AIDS presenters, (ii) known HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral treatment, and (iii) known HIV-positive patients not receiving antiretroviral treatment were calculated. The overall incidence of AIDS decreased over time, mainly due to the lower number of patients on antiretroviral treatment developing AIDS. Factors associated with a higher risk of being an AIDS presenter were male gender and year of HIV diagnosis. Among patients with AIDS, the proportion of AIDS presenters increased from 13.8% prior to 1997 (when protease inhibitors were introduced in Italy) to 32.5% after 1997. Variables predictive of being an AIDS presenter were male gender, age at diagnosis, and AIDS diagnosis in the years 1997-2000. Heterosexuals had a higher risk of being AIDS presenters and a lower risk of being HIV-positive and not receiving antiretroviral treatment than intravenous drug users. In Italy, AIDS occurs mainly in subjects unaware of their HIV status (especially males, the elderly, and those infected heterosexually) or in patients refusing antiretroviral therapy (mainly intravenous drug users who do not refer to specialised centres).

Risks and benefits of HCV therapy in HCV-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfected LT recipients are not well established. Among 89 HCV-HIV LT recipients in the HIVTR cohort, 39 (23% Black, 79% genotype 1, 83% fibrosis stage ≤ 1) were treated with peginterferon-a2a or a2b plus ribavirin for a median 363 days (14-1373). On intent-to-treat basis, 22% (95% CI: 10-39) and 14% (95% CI: 5-30) achieved an end-of-treatment response (EOTR) and SVR, respectively. By per-protocol analysis (completed 48 weeks of therapy ± dose reductions), 42% and 26% had EOTR and SVR, respectively. Severe adverse events occurred in 85%, with 26% hospitalized with infections and 13% developing acute rejection. Early discontinuations and dose reductions occurred in 38% and 82%, respectively, despite use of growth factors in 85%. Eighteen of 39 treated patients (46%) subsequently died/had graft loss, with 10 (26%) attributed to recurrent HCV. In conclusion, SVR rates are low and tolerability is poor in HCV-HIV coinfected transplant recipients treated with peginterferon and ribavirin. These results highlight the critical need for better tolerated and more efficacious HCV therapies for HCV-HIV coinfected transplant recipients.

It was shown previously that greater pretransplantation HCV titers are associated with relatively poor patient and graft survival. The tolerability and efficacy of antiviral therapy in patients with decompensated liver disease are not known. We conducted a pilot study to determine the likely tolerability and efficacy of pretransplantation antiviral therapy with interferon alfa-2b, with or without ribavirin. HCV RNA-positive patients at or near the top of their respective waiting lists were randomly assigned to one of three treatment regimens until the time of liver transplantation: (1) group A, interferon alfa-2b, 1 x 10(6) U/d; (2) group B, interferon alfa-2b, 3 x 10(6) U three times weekly; or (3) group C, interferon alfa-2b, 1 x 10(6) U/d, plus ribavirin, 400 mg twice daily. Less than half the patients screened met entry criteria, with thrombocytopenia and leukopenia the most common reasons for exclusion. Fifteen patients were administered antiviral therapy; three patients in group A and six patients each in groups B and C. Loss of detectable HCV RNA was seen in 33% of patients, whereas 55% had a decrease in viral titers on therapy. Twenty-three adverse events occurred, including 20 serious adverse events. Thrombocytopenia was the most common adverse event. Two infectious complications occurred; one of these had a fatal outcome. We conclude that although pretransplantation antiviral therapy may reduce HCV titers in a minority of patients who meet treatment initiation criteria, adverse events associated with therapy are frequent and often severe in patients with Child's class B and C cirrhosis.

Unfortunately, recurrent infection of the graft can be associated with aggressive disease, and with diminished graft and patient survival. Currently, the role of nucleoside analogues for prevention of graft re-infection is being evaluated. Preliminary results are encouraging, but treatment failure has been associated with emergence of drug-resistant virus.

In 2012-2013, we designed a qualitative study to explore barriers to adherence in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We conducted six focus groups comprising 23 adults receiving treatment for either MDR-TB (n = 2) or XDR-TB (n = 21); 17 were on concurrent ART. Participants expressed a preference for ART over M/XDR-TB treatment as a result of greater tolerability, lower pill burden and a commitment to ART. Treatment outcomes and the social morbidity associated with M/XDR-TB, characterised by public notification, stigma and social isolation, were perceived to be worse than with HIV. Poor communication, low patient involvement and provider supervision of treatment exacerbated participants' negative experiences with TB care. To improve adherence, it is critical that new regimens for drug-resistant TB be developed with better efficacy, lower pill burden and fewer adverse effects. For the first time, such improved regimens are on the horizon. In parallel and equally important is the implementation of a cohesive approach that promotes patient involvement, empowerment and treatment literacy for HIV and for TB.

In this retrospective study including 1065 adult liver transplantations performed between 1977 and 2012, we analyzed long-term patient and graft survival and occurrence of HBV infection. A total of 52 (5.1%) patients received an anti-HBc+ graft. The 10-year graft and patient survival of these recipients were 50.9% and 59.0% compared to 72.0% and 76.5% (P = 0.001; P = 0.004) of patients receiving anti-HBc- grafts, respectively. Cox regression model showed that high urgency allocation (P = 0.003), recipient age (P = 0.027), anti-HCV+ recipients (P = 0.005), and anti-HBc+ organs (P = 0.048) are associated with decreased graft survival. Thirteen of 52 (25.0%) patients receiving anti-HBc+ grafts developed post-transplant HBV infection within a mean of 2.8 years. In this study, antiviral prophylaxis did not have significant impact on HBV infection, but long-term survival (P = 0.008). Development of post-transplant HBV infection did not affect adjusted 10-year graft survival (100% vs. 100%; P = 1). Anti-HBc+ liver grafts can be transplanted with reasonable but inferior long-term patient and graft survival. The inferior graft survival is not, however, related with post-transplant HBV infection as long as early diagnosis and treatment take place.

Besides negatively affecting both patient and graft survival, HCV is associated with a heightened risk for new onset diabetes mellitus (NODM). The mechanisms underlying the diabetogenicity of HCV are complex but are likely to involve insulin resistance caused by inhibitory actions of the virus on insulin regulatory pathways in the liver. The resultant glucose dysregulation is an important determinant of increased morbidity and mortality in liver and kidney recipients. This review highlights the concerns for outcomes in HCV-positive liver and kidney transplant patients with particular focus on the interrelationship between hepatitis C and diabetes. Data about the potential role of calcineurin inhibitors, corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil in HCV infection and HCV-associated NODM will also be discussed.

Treatment naive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients were randomized to receive either placebo or G-CSF (0.3 mg/ml, 3 times a week) for 12 weeks and HAART simultaneously. The trial was terminated prematurely after interim analysis performed because of a case of severe encephalopathia in the G-CSF group. At that point 11 HIV infected patients with a CD4+ T cell count < 350/mm3 had been randomized to the G-CSF group (n = 6) or placebo group (n = 5). In both groups plasma HIV RNA decreased significantly in response to HAART. However, plasma HIV RNA changed significantly different between the two groups with the decrease being less pronounced in the G-CSF group (P = 0.02). The concentrations of CD4+ memory T cells and CD8+ naive and memory T cells increased in response to HAART, and there was a trend towards more pronounced increases in several T-cell subpopulations in the G-CSF group. The CD56+ NK cells increased significantly more in the G-CSF group compared with placebo (P = 0. 000). All patients in the G-CSF group reported bone pain. The present data do not support simultaneous administration of G-CSF with initiation of HAART in treatment naive HIV infected patients.

Samples were obtained both before and after 35-365 days of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). By polymerase chain reaction, JC virus (JCV) DNA was found in 6 of 7 patients at baseline but in only 1 patient after HAART. In contrast, in 25 historical control patients from whom sequential CSF specimens were obtained, no reversion from detectable to undetectable JCV DNA was observed. By use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, intrathecal production of antibody to JCV-VP1 was shown in only 1 of 4 HAART recipients at baseline but in 5 of 5 patients after treatment. The neuroradiological picture improved or had stabilized in all patients after 12 months of HAART, and all were alive after a median of 646 days (range, 505-775 days). Prolonged survival after HAART for PML is associated with JCV clearance from CSF. JCV-specific humoral intrathecal immunity may play a role in this response.

However, persistent intrathecal immunoactivation is common, even after several years of ART. To investigate whether low-level CSF viremia and residual immunoactivation within the central nervous system (CNS) derive from ongoing local viral replication, we conducted a study of treatment intensification in patients on effective ART.

Recombinant interferon-alpha has demonstrated antitumor and antiretroviral activities in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma. Limited studies with interferon-beta suggest that it also has antitumor effects in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma, but interferon-gamma appears to be ineffective in controlling this tumor. The hematopoietic growth factors, including erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), have been evaluated in several populations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. The combination of G-CSF and recombinant human erythropoietin completely reversed the zidovudine-induced neutropenia of AIDS patients but was only partially effective in reversing anemia. In several clinical trials, GM-CSF induced marked increases in leukocyte counts and improved neutrophil function in some AIDS patients. In severely immunocompromised patients with disease caused by HIV who were receiving therapy with either G-CSF or GM-CSF, opportunistic infections continued to occur despite increases in circulating white blood cell counts. Recombinant cytokines may be used in the future in AIDS patients as adjunctive treatment with myelosuppressive antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs, as a possible means of enhancing host defense, or as agents of immune reconstitution.

CSF MMP-9 activity was detected in 40% of HIV-infected patients (but not in controls) and was significantly more frequent in HIV-infected patients than in those without neurologic deficits (50% vs. 13.6%). The frequency of CSF MMP-9 activity did not significantly differ between neurologically symptomatic HIV-infected patients with or without opportunistic central nervous system disease (51.6% vs. 48.1%). Additionally, the presence of CSF MMP-9 activity in HIV-infected patients was associated with an increased CSF white blood cell count and an elevated CSF-to-serum albumin ratio, suggesting that it may play a role in blood-brain/CSF barrier leakage in HIV-infected patients.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and urine from 52 AIDS patients suffering from various neurological diseases including 21 cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and PBMCs and urine from healthy subjects were evaluated by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of DNA belonging to the highly conserved large T antigen (LT) of JC virus. The different JC virus subtypes were identified by nucleotide sequence analysis of the virion protein (VP1) genomic region. JC virus DNA was detected in all the CSF samples from the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy patients, but not in the CSF from non-progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy cases, while the frequency of JC virus DNA detection in the PBMCs and urine did not differ among the three groups studied. JC virus type 2 was detected only in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy patients, and in particular in 52.4% of their CSF samples. Moreover, in the CSF of 19.0% of the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy cases, dual infection with both JC virus types 1 and 2 was found. The data obtained in this study indicate that the unexpected involvement of JC virus type 2, a strain not common in Italy, and the high frequency of dual infection with both JC virus types 1 and 2 in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy CSF, can be indications of risk factors for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy development.

Paired CSF and plasma specimens were drawn from 18 patients receiving HAART at baseline and after 9 to 70 months of therapy. At baseline, median HIV-1 RNA concentrations were 4.13 log10 copies/ml in CSF and 5.31 log10 copies/ml in plasma. At the time of on-therapy CSF sampling, HIV-1 RNA was undetectable in CSF from 13/18 patients (72%), and in plasma from 9/18 patients (50%). The genotypic analysis at baseline revealed reverse transcriptase (RT) resistance mutations in 7 of 11 (64%) CSF samples and in 8 of 11 (73%) plasma samples. No patient had protease resistance mutations, except for secondary mutations. At the time of virological failure in CSF, new RT and protease resistance mutations were found in both CSF and plasma of the two patients with both baseline and on-treatment paired evaluations. At long-term follow-up, the proportion of patients failing to respond virologically was lower in CSF than in plasma. Virological failure in CSF was associated with failure to respond in plasma and onset of new drug resistance mutations in both compartments.

Whereas systemic syphilis infection increases plasma HIV RNA levels (viral load; VL), effects of syphilis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VL are unknown. We hypothesized that intrathecal immune activation in neurosyphilis would selectively increase CSF VL in coinfected patients. In this study, HIV-infected research subjects (N = 225) were categorized into three groups based on serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR), microhemaglutination for Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP) MHA-TP, and CSF VDRL: 23 with neurosyphilis (NS+; reactive serum RPR and MHA-TP and positive CSF VDRL); 42 with systemic syphilis but not neurosyphilis (Syph+; reactive serum RPR and MHA-TP; negative CSF VDRL), and 160 without syphilis (Syph-; nonreactive serum RPR). Plasma and CSF HIV VL were quantified by reverse transcriptase-ploymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Amplicor, Roche) in log(10) copies/ml. To adjust for covariates previously shown to influence CSF HIV VL (i.e., plasma VL, CD4, pleocytosis, and highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]), multivariable linear regression was used. Lumbar punctures (LP) done for research purposes diagnosed 23 with neurosyphilis; most (83%) of these reported prior syphilis treatment. Among subjects with detectable plasma VL, CSF VL was highest in NS+, followed by Syph+ and Syph- (P =.006). This relationship was independent of the level of plasma VL or CSF pleocytosis. By contrast, among subjects with undetectable plasma HIV VL, CSF VLs were similar in the three syphilis subgroups (P = .50). Neurosyphilis may amplify intrathecal HIV replication, possibly through immune activation that persists even after syphilis treatment. Because elevated CSF VL is associated with subsequent neurocognitive decline, future studies should evaluate the impact of neurosyphilis on the course of central nervous system (CNS) HIV infection.

Here, we investigate how cell-free mtDNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is associated with inflammation, neuronal damage, and neurocognitive functioning in the context of long-term suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). We quantified the levels of cell-free mtDNA in the CSF from 41 HIV-infected individuals with completely suppressed HIV RNA levels in blood plasma (<50 copies/mL) by droplet digital PCR. We measured soluble CD14, soluble CD163, interferon γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), neopterin, and neurofilament light chain (NFL) by immunoassays in CSF supernatant or blood plasma. Higher levels of mtDNA in CSF were associated with higher levels of MCP-1 (r = 0.56, p < 0.01) in CSF and TNF-α (r = 0.43, p < 0.01) and IL-8 (r = 0.44, p < 0.01) in blood plasma. Subjects with a previous diagnosis of AIDS showed significantly higher levels of mtDNA (p < 0.01) than subjects without AIDS. The associations between mtDNA and MCP-1 in CSF and TNF-α in blood remained significant after adjusting for previous diagnosis of AIDS (p < 0.01). Additionally, higher levels of mtDNA were associated with a lower CD4 nadir (r = -0.41, p < 0.01) and lower current CD4% (r = -0.34, p = 0.03). Paradoxically, higher levels of mtDNA in CSF were significantly associated with better neurocognitive performance (r = 0.43, p = 0.02) and with less neuronal damage (i.e. lower NFL). Higher cell-free mtDNA is associated with inflammation during treated HIV infection, but the impact on neurocognitive functioning and neuronal damage remains unclear and may differ in the setting of suppressive ART.

Of 38 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 22 (58%) and 16 (42%) patients, respectively. Among the IL-1 beta- and IL-6-positive CSF were eight of 15 HIV-1 patients with no clinical signs of central nervous system involvement and four of five patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex. The presence of IL-6 was often associated with IL-1 beta and soluble interleukin-2 receptor in CSF as well as with intrathecal IgG synthesis. In none of the CSF samples tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-2 was detected.

We report two cases of GCH among 81 HIV patients co-infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Both patients had a sustained virological response, suppression of HCV viral load and HIV viral suppression after highly active antiretroviral therapy. Our findings would suggest that the presence of giant cells does not influence the clinical course of hepatitis.

This prompted a reevaluation of organ-solid transplantation as a treatment option for HIV-infected patients. Some trials in the United States have shown that one- and 2-year graft and patient survival is comparable to HIV-negative transplant population. In Europe the experience is still scarce. The aim of this study is to analyse the outcome and the clinical characteristics of HIV-infected patients who received kidney transplantation in Spain in the HAART era. Ten patients were transplanted in our country since 2001. Only one patient was black. The main cause of end-stage renal disease reported was glomerulonephritis. Six of the recipients were coinfected by hepatitis C virus. Inclusion criteria included undetectable HIV viral load and CD4 counts greater than 200/pL. Immunosuppression consisted of steroids, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, with antibody induction in 4 cases. The median and mean follow-up was 11 and 16.3+/-15.6 (3-46) months, respectively. One recipient lost his graft because of early renal venous thrombosis. The remaining patients are functioning graft with mean serum creatinina level of 1.5 +/- 0.5 mg/dl. Biopsy-proven acute rejection was diagnosed in 4 recipients and was reversed in all cases with antirejection treatment. The plasma HIV RNA levels have remained controlled and CD4 counts have been stable in excess of 200 cell/microL. None of patients have developed AIDS complications. Recipients receiving protease inhibitor-based HAART regimens required significant dosing modification to maintain appropriate tacrolimus levels. Our results show that renal transplantation can be a safe and effective treatment in select HIV-infected patients. Like other series, the acute rejection rate was higher than in non-HIV recipients. The reasons of this rejection incidence remain unknown.

This study aimed to: determine clusters of patients with similar symptom combinations; describe symptom combinations distinguishing the clusters; and evaluate the clusters regarding patient socio-demographic, disease and treatment characteristics, quality of life (QOL) and functional performance. This was a cross-sectional study of 302 adult HIV/AIDS outpatients consecutively recruited at two teaching and referral hospitals in Uganda. Socio-demographic and seven-day period symptom prevalence and distress data were self-reported using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Schedule. QOL was assessed using the Medical Outcome Scale and functional performance using the Karnofsky Performance Scale. Symptom clusters were established using hierarchical cluster analysis with squared Euclidean distances using Ward's clustering methods based on symptom occurrence. Analysis of variance compared clusters on mean QOL and functional performance scores. Patient subgroups were categorised based on symptom occurrence rates. Five symptom occurrence clusters were identified: Cluster 1 (n=107), high-low for sensory discomfort and eating difficulties symptoms; Cluster 2 (n=47), high-low for psycho-gastrointestinal symptoms; Cluster 3 (n=71), high for pain and sensory disturbance symptoms; Cluster 4 (n=35), all high for general HIV/AIDS symptoms; and Cluster 5 (n=48), all low for mood-cognitive symptoms. The all high occurrence cluster was associated with worst functional status, poorest QOL scores and highest symptom-associated distress. Use of antiretroviral therapy was associated with all high symptom occurrence rate (Fisher's exact=4, P<0.001). CD4 count group below 200 was associated with the all high occurrence rate symptom cluster (Fisher's exact=41, P<0.001). Symptom clusters have a differential, affect HIV/AIDS patients' self-reported outcomes, with the subgroup experiencing high-symptom occurrence rates having a higher risk of poorer outcomes. Identification of symptom clusters could provide insights into commonly co-occurring symptoms that should be jointly targeted for management in patients with multiple complaints.

The study was undertaken to explore how often HBV infection may remain occult after OLT for hepatitis C, and whether it may represent a factor of graft fibrosis progression. We studied 30 consecutive patients transplanted for hepatitis C liver disease. Specimens from the native liver and from the graft were searched for occult HBV infection (O-HBV). In the native liver, 8/30 patients had detectable O-HBV; during the follow-up, O-HBV infection was demonstrated in 14 graft specimens. Graft O-HBV was associated with older donor age (> or =50 yr; 8/9 vs. 6/21, p < 0.005). Recipients with graft O-HBV and no O-HBV in the native liver who received their grafts from donors aged >40 yr had faster fibrosis progression than recipients with no post-transplant O-HBV, whose grafts came from donors aged >40 yr and recipients whose grafts came from donors aged < or =40 yr (4/7 vs. 1/7 vs. 2/16, p < 0.05). In OLT recipients, O-HBV is more likely to occur when grafts are obtained from aged donors and may affect the rate of fibrosis progression because of recurrent hepatitis C.

Three-hundred two adult ambulatory HIV/AIDS patients were consecutively recruited from HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics at 2 teaching hospitals in Uganda. The presence and intensity of pain were self-reported using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI); symptom data were collected using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS-SF); and quality of life (QOL) was assessed using the Medical Outcome Scale-HIV. Forty-seven percent reported pain in the 7 days prior to the survey and pain was a symptom at the time of diagnosis for 68%. On the 0 to 10 numeric scale, 53% reported mild pain (1-4 rating), 20% reported moderate pain (5-6 rating) while 27% reported severe pain (7-10 rating). Gender was not associated with pain intensity, but reduced functional performance, increasing number of symptoms, advanced HIV disease , physical symptom distress (MSAS-SF), and number of health comorbidities were significantly associated with pain intensity (P < .04). Increasing pain intensity was associated with greater functional ability impairment (BPI functional interference index) and poorer QOL. Pain is a common symptom among ambulatory HIV/AIDS patients and has a debilitating effect on QOL. There is a significant unmet need for pain relief in the population.

As the awareness of PAH has increased, it is more likely that this condition will be diagnosed more frequently and earlier in the course of the disease and HIV infection. The etiopathogenesis is not clear; no evidence of direct infection of the pulmonary vascular tree has been found and the current evidence seems to favor a role of dysregulated cytokine response to HIV infection. The pathological changes of plexiform arteriopathy are indistinguishable from the pathological changes of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Dyspnea is the most common presenting symptom. Echocardiography, though always not accurate in diagnosing PAH and estimating its severity, remains the main screening tool. Right heart catheterization is the gold standard investigation for diagnosis. New therapies like prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors have improved the outcome of patients with HIV-associated PAH. However, the overall prognosis of HIV-infected patients who develop PAH still remains poor.

These studies consistently describe stable HIV disease following liver and kidney transplantation. Despite good graft survival, kidney allograft rejection occurs frequently, and serious non-AIDS-defining infections requiring hospitalization are common following antirejection therapy. Profound interactions between immunosuppressants and antiretroviral drugs require careful monitoring, dose adjustment, and highly effective communication between the patient and a multidisciplinary group of health care providers. Despite these scientific and policy advances, many health care providers and patients remain unaware of ongoing progress in this field. The implications are critical, as late referral for liver transplant evaluation increases the pretransplant mortality risk. Because important patient selection and clinical management questions remain, it is critical that ongoing studies are completed quickly.

Both grafts were infected by hepatitis B and D virus. The appearance of hepatitis B and D antigens in the graft were investigated in serial liver biopsies in relation to light microscopical and biochemical changes. One week after transplantation HDAg could already be demonstrated in 1-50 percent of hepatocytic nuclei, in one graft combined with HBsAg along the cell membranes. In the three-week biopsies the expression of HBsAg had increased. After 7-9 weeks both grafts showed biochemical and histological evidence of an acute hepatitis; at that time HBcAg and HBeAg had appeared in the nucleus and cytoplasm of many hepatocytes. Thereafter HBcAg and HBeAg expression in the liver tissue decreased slowly, and acute hepatitis transformed into chronic hepatitis. Two and three years after transplantation both grafts showed good function, with only minimal fibrosis in one and severe fibrosis in the other. HDAg and HBsAg expression persisted, while HBc and HBeAg disappeared in the one with minimal fibrosis and decreased in the other. It is concluded that the course of HBV with HDV co-infection in liver grafts includes an excellent medium-term prognosis.

We evaluated disease symptoms as predictors of acute weight loss (i.e., loss of > or =5% of weight). HIV-infected men and women (n=415) were telephoned every 5 weeks to obtain information about weight and recent symptoms. Weight change between each pair of consecutive calls (telephone intervals, 2814) was calculated. Acute weight loss occurred across 4.5% of intervals and among 24% of individuals. Patients reported > or =1 symptom before 58% of telephone intervals. The most common symptoms or symptom complexes before intervals were diarrhea (21% of patients), anorexia (17%), upper respiratory symptoms (16%), skin symptoms (12%), and abdominal pain (12%). Trouble swallowing (6%) and oral symptoms (7%) were less common. Risk of acute weight loss was significantly increased when oral symptoms or trouble swallowing were present, and it was decreased when highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was used or when diarrhea was not present. Even when HAART is being administered, clinicians should remain vigilant regarding weight loss, oral symptoms, and trouble swallowing.

For many investigators, retransplantation appears contraindicated because of constant recurrence and a high mortality. We report our experience in this setting. Between January 1985 and December 1995, 10 patients who underwent retransplantation for HBV graft reinfection were studied. According to the antiviral treatment administered after HBV recurrence on the first liver graft and the protocol of antiviral prophylaxis after retransplantation, two groups were defined: group 1 underwent retransplantation before January 1992 (n = 5), and group 2 underwent retransplantation after January 1992 (n = 5). At the time of reinfection, serum HBV DNA was positive in all patients, hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) was positive in 6 patients. Antiviral therapy was administered to 7 patients (group 1, adenine arabinoside mono phosphate [ara-Amp; n = 3]; group 2, ara-Amp [n = 5], ganciclovir [n = 4]). After retransplantation, long-term antibody to HB surface antigen (anti-HBs) immunoglobulins were administered to achieve an anti-HBs titer greater than 100 IU/L in group 1 and to achieve an anti-HBs titer greater than 500 IU/L associated with prophylactic intravenous ganciclovir administration (5 mg/kg three times weekly) for 2 years in group 2. In group 1, all patients died, either perioperatively or secondary to HBV recurrence (1 year survival, 0%). In group 2, 1 patient died 50 months after retransplantation of HBV cirrhosis on the second graft, and 4 patients remained HBsAg negative at a mean of 41 months (range, 24 to 68 months) after retransplantation. The prognosis of retransplantation for HBV recurrence was dramatically improved by the administration of antiviral therapy before retransplantation and the maintenance of a high anti-HBs level combined with antiviral therapy after retransplantation.

Excess body fat may therefore exacerbate the bioenergetic dysfunction observed with HIV infection. To determine if body fat is associated with bioenergetic function in HIV, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 42 women with HIV who were virologically suppressed on antiretroviral therapy. Body composition was determined via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of monocytes was sorted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from participants in the fasting state. Differences in bioenergetic function, as measured by OCR, was assessed using Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman correlations adjusted for age, race, and smoking status. Participants were 86% Black, 45.5 years old, 48% current smokers, and 57% were obese (body mass index ≥30). Nearly all women (93%) had >30% total fat mass, while 12% had >50% total fat mass. Elevated levels of total fat mass, trunk fat, and leg fat were inversely correlated with measures of bioenergetic health as evidenced by lower maximal and reserve capacity OCR, and Bioenergetic Health Index. Measures of extracellular acidification (ECAR) in the absence (basal) or maximal (with oligomycin) were positively correlated with measures of bioenergetics, except proton leak, and were negatively correlated with fat mass. Despite virological suppression, women with HIV present with extremely high levels of adiposity that correlate with impaired bioenergetic health. Without effective interventions, this syndemic of HIV infection and obesity will likely have devastating consequences for our patients, potentially mediated through altered mitochondrial and glycolytic function.

Hypertension prevalence was similar in HIV-positive and HIV-negative women (26 versus 28%, P = 0.38). Factors associated with hypertension included increasing age (P < 0.0001), African-American race (P < 0.0001), and body mass index greater than 30 kg/m (P < 0.0001), whereas current pregnancy was protective (P < 0.04).

Interviews with HIV-positive gay men diagnosed with acute hepatitis C., Abstract: Since 2001, cases of hepatitis C virus (HCV) sexual transmission have been reported in France, among HIV-positive gay men who do not inject drugs. An earlier study focused on the incidence of acute hepatitis C and risk factors associated with HCV transmission. The present study, based on in-depth interviews, aimed to highlight the biography, the sexual practices and the experiences of gay men infected with HCV. Beyond an apparent uniformity, the group of interviewees illustrates a variety of situations, life stories and health pathways, depending on their age. These well-adjusted gay men were used to engaging in unprotected sexual practices, but before their diagnosis they largely ignored HCV-transmission risk, which was associated in their mind with a pejorative drug addict image. Once diagnosed with acute hepatitis C, they experienced a critical and emotional period during which they were open to discuss their sexual practices and reconsider risk-reduction procedures, without being willing to give up on their satisfying sex life. Health educators should consider labelling hepatitis C as an STI in order to disrupt its negative image and to help HIV-positive gay man raise their awareness of HCV-transmission risks and implement better risk-reduction strategies.

Androgen deficiency in HIV-infected patients is associated with decreased muscle mass and function, and adverse disease outcome. Administration of replacement doses of testosterone to healthy hypogonadal men augments lean body mass, muscle size, and maximal voluntary strength. Recent studies have shown that physiologic testosterone replacement in HIV-infected men with weight loss who have low testosterone levels can also increase muscle mass and effort-dependent strength. However, further studies are needed to determine whether androgen therapy can improve physical function and health-related outcomes in HIV-infected men.

While this baseline HCV RNA concentration ([HCV RNA](BL)) is predictive of a sustained virologic response to treatment, its determinants are only partially identified. We therefore analyzed the baseline characteristics of 2,472 HCV genotype 1-infected patients to identify correlations with gender, age, race, weight, body mass index (BMI), HCV acquisition mode, HCV subtype, alanine aminotransferase concentration, or histopathologic changes in the liver. After separation of the data according to four [HCV RNA](BL) groups (< or =5.0, >5.0 to 5.6, >5.6 to 5.9, and >5.9 log(10) IU/ml), we determined that increasing [HCV RNA](BL) correlated (P < 0.05) with increasing proportions of patients who were male, >40 years of age, or heavier (a weight of >85 kg or a BMI of >27 kg/m(2)). Histologic activity index (HAI) data were available for 1,304 of these patients: increasing [HCV RNA](BL) correlated with higher fibrosis and necrosis-inflammation scores. As a continuous variable, [HCV RNA](BL) correlated with age, gender, weight (continuous or < or =85 versus >85 kg), BMI (continuous or < or =27 versus >27 kg/m(2)), subtype, fibrosis score, and necrosis-inflammation score; however, multiple-regression analysis yielded P values of <0.1 only for age, gender, BMI (< or =27 versus >27 kg/m(2)), and fibrosis score. While our findings are suggestive of a role for these factors in maintenance of the pretreatment state of HCV infection, the multiple-regression model accounted for only < or =4.6% of the [HCV RNA](BL) differences between individuals (R(2) = 0.046 for 1,304 patients with HAI scores; 0.043 for all 2,472 patients).

This study examined cognitive functioning in 46 HIV-positive gay men relative to an age and education equivalent group of 13 HIV-negative gay men. The HIV-positive men were asymptomatic except for lymphadenopathy or T4 counts less than 700. The cognitive battery measured language, memory, visuospatial, information processing speeds, reasoning, attention, and psychomotor processes. The HIV-positive group was significantly slower in processing information and performed significantly less well than the HIV-negative group on certain verbal memory measures. Deviations of 1 as well as 2 SDs from the norm/control group mean on four or more tests were observed in 43% and 22% of the HIV-positive subjects, respectively, compared with 8% and none of the HIV-negative subjects, respectively. The results suggest that cognitive inefficiency occurs in a subsample of individuals during early HIV infection.
=> 7th document retrieved: Order: 14748, Title: Exercise and the treatment of wasting: aging and human immunodeficiency virus infection., Abstract: A common feature of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and aging is the loss of skeletal muscle mass. Although the causes of this loss of muscle are multifactorial, there may be some shared characteristics to this loss, and therefore common strategies for its prevention or reversal. For example, loss of muscle mass early in life and early in the progression of HIV infection may result from decreased levels of physical activity. The rapid loss of skeletal muscle mass at the end of life (sometimes referred to as failure to thrive syndrome) and in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients may also have common cause: cachexia. However, it also must be pointed out that loss of skeletal muscle mass with advancing age also may result from losses of motor units, decreased rate of skeletal muscle protein synthesis, and impaired regulation of appetite. These factors have not been demonstrated to be consequences of HIV infection. The use of exercise to treat the losses of muscle size, strength, and functional capacity holds great promise. Although the losses of muscle with HIV infection may be more rapid and dramatic than those seen with aging, resistance exercise training can attenuate or arrest this loss. In elderly people, resistance exercise has been demonstrated to result in increased nitrogen balance, muscle mass and strength, functional capacity, energy requirements, and when combined with a protein calorie supplement, increased energy intake. The use of resistance exercise in HIV-infected patients may also provide similar results. This review discusses many of the changes in body composition, physiological function, and metabolism associated with aging and HIV infection. The specific effects of exercise in the elderly and in patients infected with HIV on the treatment of muscle wasting, and its consequences are also discussed.

Nonetheless, little is known regarding factors associated with CD4 and CD8 cell numbers in HIV-uninfected individuals. To ascertain potential factors associated with differences in CD4 and CD8 cells among HIV negative women, we studied these cells in a group of 953 women, enrolled as HIV-negative comparators in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Using standard techniques, we measured CD4 and CD8 cells obtained during study-related visits every six months through visit 20 (maximum of 9.5 years). Results were correlated with demographic and behavioral factors, and data were analyzed using a multiple linear regression approach with generalized estimating equations. At baseline, the median age was 32.4 years, body mass index (BMI) was 26.4 kg/m(2), CD4 cell count was 1010 (range 214-2705)/microL, and CD8 cell count was 542 (range 72-2448)/microL. African-Americans comprised 54%, 24% were Hispanic, and 19% were Caucasian. In multivariate analysis, increasing age (p = 0.0006), increasing BMI (p = 0.001), and current smoking status (p = 0.03) were independent predictors of higher CD4 counts. Multivariate analyses of CD8 cells revealed that lower age (p = 0.001), higher BMI (p = 0.03), Hispanic race/ethnicity (p = 0.01); current smoking (p = 0.006), injection drug use (p = 0.02), and Hepatitis C infection (p = 0.01) were independent predictors of higher CD8 cell counts. Multiple demographic and behavioral factors may influence CD4 and CD8 counts in HIV negative women. These factors must be considered in future analyses comparing lymphocyte subsets in HIV positive and negative women.

Cardiovascular risk is increased among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. To assess LV mass/hypertrophy in HIV infection, 654 women enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study underwent transthoracic echocardiography. There were 454 HIV-infected and 200 uninfected women, mean age 40.8 +/- 9.3 years. LV mass/height(2.7) was similar between the HIV-infected and the HIV-uninfected groups (41.4 +/- 11.1 vs. 39.9 +/- 10.3 g/h(2.7); p = 0.37). The prevalence of LVH was similar between the two groups (LVH by LV mass/height(2.7) criteria 15.0% vs. 13.0%, p = 0.29). Relative wall thickness (RWT), defined as the ratio of LV wall thickness to cavity diameter, was also similar between the HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected groups (0.36 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.37 +/- 0.06, p = 0.16). On multiple linear regression analysis adjusting for age, W/H ratio, triceps skinfold thickness, systolic/diastolic BP, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia; HIV status (b = 2.08, p = 0.02, CI 0.27-3.88); weight (b per kg = 0.15, p < 0.01, CI 0.08-0.22); and smoking duration (b per one-year increase = 0.08, p = 0.03, CI 0.01-0.16) were independent correlates of LV mass/height(2.7) (Model R(2) = 0.20, p < 0.001). Weight (aOR = 1.04, CI 1.01-1.06) and smoking duration (aOR = 1.03, CI 1.01-1.06) were independent correlates of LVH. Being HIV negative, increased age, increased triceps skinfold thickness, and higher W/H ratio were independent correlates of higher RWT. Among HIV-infected women, higher LV mass was not associated with a history of AIDS-defining illness, nadir CD4(+) count <200 cells/microl, or with the duration of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Women taking NRTIs had higher LV mass. Higher RWT was associated with current CD4(+) count. In conclusion, HIV infection is associated with greater LV mass but not with a higher prevalence of LVH. Among HIV-infected women, RWT, but not LV mass, is associated with the degree of immunosuppression.

We, therefore, examined the effects of testosterone replacement by means of Androderm, a permeation-enhanced, nongenital transdermal system, on lean body mass, body weight, muscle strength, health-related quality of life, and HIV-disease markers. We randomly assigned 41 HIV-infected, ambulatory men, 18-60 yr of age, with serum testosterone levels below 400 ng/dL, to 1 of 2 treatment groups: group I, two placebo patches (n = 21); or group II, two testosterone patches designed to release 5 mg testosterone over 24 h. Eighteen men in the placebo group and 14 men in the testosterone group completed the 12-week treatment. Serum total and free testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels increased, and LH and FSH levels decreased in the testosterone-treated, but not in the placebo-treated, men. Lean body mass and fat-free mass, measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, increased significantly in men receiving testosterone patches [change in lean body mass, +1.345 +/- 0.533 kg (P = 0.02 compared to no change); change in fat-free mass, +1.364 +/- 0.525 kg (P = 0.02 compared to no change)], but did not change in the placebo group [change in lean body mass, 0.189 +/- 0.470 kg (P = NS compared to no change); change in fat-free mass, 0.186 +/- 0.470 kg (P = NS compared to no change)]. However, there was no significant difference between the 2 treatment groups in the change in lean body mass. The change in lean body mass during treatment was moderately correlated with the increment in serum testosterone levels (r = 0.41; P = 0.02). The testosterone-treated men experienced a greater decrease in fat mass than those receiving placebo patches (P = 0.04). There was no significant change in body weight in either treatment group. Changes in overall quality of life scores did not correlate with testosterone treatment; however, in the subcategory of role limitation due to emotional problems, the men in the testosterone group improved an average of 43 points of a 0-100 possible score, whereas those in the placebo group did not change. Red cell count increased in the testosterone group (change in red cell count, +0.1 +/- 0.1 10(12)/L) but decreased in the placebo group (change in red cell count, -0.2 +/- 0.1 10(12)/L). CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts and plasma HIV copy number did not significantly change during treatment. Serum prostate-specific antigen and plasma lipid levels did not change in either treatment group. Testosterone replacement in HIV-infected men with low testosterone levels is safe and is associated with a 1.35-kg gain in lean body mass, a significantly greater reduction in fat mass than that achieved with placebo treatment, an increased red cell count, and an improvement in role limitation due to emotional problems. Further studies are needed to assess whether testosterone supplementation can produce clinically meaningful changes in muscle function and disease outcome in HIV-infected men.

This study reviews the roles of genetic polymorphisms, HIV-1 infection, and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in lipid metabolism. Lipid abnormalities can vary according to the HAART regimen, such as those with protease inhibitors (PIs). However, genetic factors may also be involved in dyslipidemia because not all patients receiving the same HAART regimen and with comparable demographic, virological, and immunological characteristics develop variations in the lipid profile. Polymorphisms in a large number of genes are involved in the synthesis of structural proteins, and enzymes related to lipid metabolism account for variations in the lipid profile of each individual. As some genetic polymorphisms may cause dyslipidemia, these allele variants should be investigated in HIV-1-infected patients to identify individuals with an increased risk of developing dyslipidemia during treatment with HAART, particularly during therapy with PIs. This knowledge may guide individualized treatment decisions and lead to the development of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of dyslipidemia in these patients.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of HAART-associated lipodystrophy on resting energy expenditure and caloric intake. In this cross-sectional study we compared resting energy expenditure (REE) and energy intake in 30 HAART-treated patients with lipodystrophy (HAART+LD+) with 13 HAART-treated patients without lipodystrophy (HAART+LD-). REE was measured using indirect calorimetry, and energy intake was recorded as a 3-day diary of food intake. REE (5,180+/-160 vs. 4,260+/-150 J/min, P<0.01) and also REE expressed per fat-free mass (86+/-1 vs. 78+/-2 J.kg fat-free mass-1.min-1, P<0.01) were significantly higher in the HAART+LD+ than the HAART+LD- group. Rate of lipid oxidation was significantly higher in the HAART+LD+ than the HAART+LD- group. Total energy and fat intakes were significantly increased in the HAART+LD+ compared with the HAART+LD- group. These results imply that HAART-associated lipodystrophy is associated with increased REE and lipid oxidation and with increased caloric and fat intake.

To enhance lymphatic delivery of anti-HIV drugs, a novel drug delivery strategy was designed consisting of lipid-associated indinavir (50-80 nm in diameter) complexes in suspension for subcutaneous (SC) injection. Due to the pH-dependent lipophilicity of indinavir, practically all the drug molecules are incorporated into lipid phase when formulated at pH 7.4 and 5:1 lipid-to-drug (m/m) ratio. At pH 5.5, about 20% of drugs were found in lipid-drug complexes. Effects of lipid association on the time course of plasma indinavir concentrations were determined in macaques (Macaca nemestrina) administered with either soluble or lipid-associated formulation of indinavir (10 mg/kg, SC). Results yielded about a 10-fold reduction in peak plasma concentration and a 6-fold enhancement in terminal half-life (t1/2beta = 12 vs. 2 hours). In addition, indinavir concentrations in both peripheral and visceral lymph nodes were 250-2270% higher than plasma (compared with <35% with soluble lipid-free drug administration in humans). Administration of lipid-associated indinavir (20 mg/kg daily) to HIV-2287-infected macaques (at 30-33 weeks after infection) resulted in significantly reduced viral RNA load and increased CD4 T cell number concentrations. Collectively, these data indicate that lipid association greatly enhances delivery of the anti-HIV drug indinavir to lymph nodes at levels that cannot be achieved with soluble drug, provides significant virus load reduction, and could potentially reverse CD4 T cell depletion due to HIV infection.

Here, two SNPs, rs12979860 and rs8099917, were analysed and related to early viral kinetics during treatment in 110 patients with HCV genotype 1 infection. The reduction of HCV RNA after 7 days of therapy was more pronounced (P < 0.0001) in patients with CC(rs12979860) or TT(rs8099917) than in patients carrying TT(rs12979860) or GG(rs8099917), respectively. The two SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium (d' = 1, r2 = 0.44), but CC(rs12979860) was less common (43% vs. 71%) than TT(rs8099917). Patients carrying both CC(rs12979860) and TT(rs8099917) genotypes achieved lower levels of HCV RNA at week 4 than those with CT or TT at rs12979860 and TT(rs8099917) (P = 0.0004). The viral elimination was significantly influenced by rs12979860 independently of baseline viral load, age or fibrosis. This translated into high rates of sustained viral response (SVR) among patients carrying CC(rs12979860) despite the presence of high viral load at baseline (SVR 74%), high age (SVR 79%) or severe liver fibrosis (SVR 83%). We conclude that the IL28B variability influences the antiviral efficiency of interferon/ribavirin therapy and has a strong impact on SVR, independently of traditional response predictors. A combined assessment of these SNPs in conjunction with other response predictors may better predict outcome in difficult-to-treat patients.

Previous analyses have failed to identify phenotypic properties other than chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CD4+ T-cell tropism that are preferentially associated with viral transmission. However, most of these studies were limited to examining envelope (Env) function in the context of pseudoviruses. Here, we generated infectious molecular clones of transmitted founder (TF; n = 27) and chronic control (CC; n = 14) viruses of subtypes B (n = 18) and C (n = 23) and compared their phenotypic properties in assays specifically designed to probe the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection. We found that TF virions were 1.7-fold more infectious (P = 0.049) and contained 1.9-fold more Env per particle (P = 0.048) compared with CC viruses. TF viruses were also captured by monocyte-derived dendritic cells 1.7-fold more efficiently (P = 0.035) and more readily transferred to CD4+ T cells (P = 0.025). In primary CD4+ T cells, TF and CC viruses replicated with comparable kinetics; however, when propagated in the presence of IFN-α, TF viruses replicated to higher titers than CC viruses. This difference was significant for subtype B (P = 0.000013) but not subtype C (P = 0.53) viruses, possibly reflecting demographic differences of the respective patient cohorts. Together, these data indicate that TF viruses are enriched for higher Env content, enhanced cell-free infectivity, improved dendritic cell interaction, and relative IFN-α resistance. These viral properties, which likely act in concert, should be considered in the development and testing of AIDS vaccines.

Steatosis and fibrosis have also been found to be associated with triglyceride (TG) levels; though, the direction of the relationship is inconsistent across studies. The objective of this study was to assess whether viral level and histological factors are associated with the serum lipid profile in a treatment-naïve cohort with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection. Participants were from the prospective Study of Viral Resistance to Antiviral Therapy (Virahep-C). Fasting lipid profiles were analysed for 160 African Americans and 170 Caucasian Americans. Linear regression was used to evaluate associations of each lipid with viral load and liver disease. TG levels were significantly and directly associated with HCV levels (P = 0.0034) and steatosis (P < 0.0001). Other lipid parameters were significantly lower in those with fibrosis [HDLc (P = 0.001) and TC levels (P = 0.004)] than in those without fibrosis. In patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, more severe liver disease was associated with lower lipid levels, with the exception of TG levels that were directly related to steatosis. The direct relationship between viral load and TG levels is consistent with proposed the mechanisms of very low density lipoprotein/HCV particle secretion. In contrast, the direct relationship between TG level and steatosis is inconsistent with posited mechanisms of HCV-induced steatosis, a possible reflection of HCV genotype 1 infection and a metabolic aetiology of steatosis.

For HIV-HCV-coinfected individuals, the burden of disease is largely related to their HCV diseases, including a faster progression to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver-related deaths. In the present thesis we investigated factors associated with spontaneous resolution and progression of HIV-HCV coinfection. In study I, we identified the study cohort of 327 individuals with HIV-HCV coinfection and a rate of spontaneous HCV resolution of 23%. We showed that female sex, coinfection with hepatitis B virus and individuals exposed through injecting drug use (IDU) or homosexual contact (MSM) had an increased rate of spontaneous HCV resolution. We speculate that differences in resolution rate may be caused by immunological memory induced by repeatedly being exposed to low-dose inoculum of HCV. In study II, we found three single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) in the interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene associated with spontaneous HCV resolution in 208 Europeans of Caucasian origin with HIV-HCV coinfection. Further, we showed that the IL28B CC genotype favourable of HCV resolution was associated with a higher HCV viral load (VL) than non-CC genotypes. These results may indicate an influence of IL28B in viral control. In study III, we conducted a survival analysis in the 264 HIV-HCV-coinfected individuals with chronic infection. We showed in a time-updated Poisson regression that HCV VL, HCV genotype 3 and IL28B CC genotype were predictors of increased mortality. This may indicate a need for closer observation in HIV-HCV-coinfected individuals with HCV genotype 3 and maybe even initiation of antiviral therapy.

CXCL12 polymorphisms have been associated with AIDS progression and survival, but there are no data related to HCV infection. The aim of this study was to determine whether CXCL12 polymorphisms are related so as to achieve sustained virological response (SVR) after HCV therapy with pegylated-interferon-alpha/ribavirin (pegIFN-α/ribavirin) in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. We carried out a retrospective study in 319 naive patients who started HCV treatment. The CXCL12 (rs266093, rs1029153, and rs1801157) and IL28B (rs12980275) polymorphisms were genotyped by using the GoldenGate assay. Genetic data were analyzed under an additive inheritance model. The overall rates of the SVR were 54.9% (175/319) and 41.5% (90/217) in GT1/4 patients and 83.2% (84/101) in GT2/3 patients. Patients with a favorable CXCL12 rs1029153 T allele had higher SVR rates than patients with the rs1029153 CC genotype (44% CC, 49% CT, and 61.3% TT; p = 0.025). No significant results for the rs266093 and rs1801157 polymorphisms were found. Patients harboring the favorable rs1029153 T allele had significantly increased odds of achieving SVR [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.55; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.01; 2.40; p = 0.047]. Moreover, no significant association was found when the study population was stratified by HCV genotype (data not shown), possibly due to the low number of patients in each group. In conclusion, in this study we found that the favorable CXCL12 rs1029153 T allele seems to be related so as to achieve an SVR in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients on pegIFN-α/ribavirin therapy.

However, their roles in the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 6 remain undetermined. Sixty patients who were infected with HCV genotype 6 were commenced on 48 weeks of combination pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy. Response to therapy, profiles of haemoglobin changes and platelet counts during therapy and their associations with IL28B rs8099917 and ITPA rs1127354 polymorphisms were analysed. The overall sustained virologic response (SVR) rate was 91.7%. 18 patients (30.0%) required a reduction in ribavirin dosage. The distribution of IL28B rs8099917 TT/TG genotypes and ITPA rs1127354 CC/CA genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. IL28B rs8099917 TT genotype, when compared to TG genotype, was significantly associated with an increased SVR rate (96.2% and 62.5%, respectively) and was the only clinical parameter that predicted SVR (P = 0.014). The same significant association was observed when analysing allelic frequencies (T vs G, P = 0.001). ITPA rs1127354 CA genotype, when compared to CC genotype, was associated with lesser degree of anaemia throughout therapy (P < 0.05 for all time points). ITPA polymorphisms showed no association with changes in platelet count throughout therapy (P > 0.05 for all time points) and was not associated with SVR (P = 0.640). In chronic HCV genotype 6 infection, IL28B polymorphisms were associated with response to therapy. ITPA polymorphisms influenced the degree of anaemia but not thrombocytopenia during therapy.

Sequence analysis revealed the following results: (1) HBeAg to anti-HBe seroconversion was correlated roughly with the occurrence of precore-defective mutants, and several years appeared to be required for complete replacement of wild types by mutants; (2) core gene mutations preceded precore-defective mutations and tended to increase with time, although not cumulatively. They occurred not only during serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations but also after ALT returned to normal; (3) ALT fluctuations appeared to subside with complete replacement of the wild type by the mutant type and/or substantial accumulation of core gene mutations; (4) unexpectedly, the anti-HBe-positive "healthy" carrier was found to harbor the wild type precore gene, as did the HBeAg-positive "healthy" carrier; however, the core gene of the former evolved at a rapid rate; and (5) a partial deletion was recognized in the core gene at the onset of fatal hepatic failure in one patient. Thus, the precore/core mutation was closely related with the clinical features in the patients.

This study aimed to analyze the response, the incidence of ADV resistance and the virologic characteristics of ADV therapy. A total of 29 CHB patients with confirmed lamivudine (LAM)-resistant HBV were treated with ADV for more than 52 weeks. Serum HBV DNA, HBV genotypes and sequences of HBV polymerase reverse-transcriptase domain were determined. Rates for the biochemical response, HBeAg loss, HBeAg seroconversion and virologic response (< 200 copies/mL of HBV DNA) were 82.8, 23.5, 11.8, and 48.3%, respectively, at week 52 of treatment. Lower pre-treatment mean HBV DNA level was the only significant factor associated with negative HBV DNA after ADV therapy. Six (20.7%) patients had clearance of LAM-resistant YMDD variants with replacement by the wild type HBV at week 52. The rtN236T, rtA181V/T and rtI233V were not identified before ADV therapy and the genotypic mutation of rtN236T was detected in one (3.4%) patient. In conclusion, the 52-week ADV treatment for patients with LAM-resistant HBV variants significantly achieved normalization of ALT levels, reduced serum HBV DNA levels and induced HBeAg loss and seroconversion. The emergence of ADV-resistant mutations seemed rare at weeks 52.
=> 3th document retrieved: Order: 13107, Title: Benefits and risks of combination therapy for hepatitis B., Abstract: In successful antiviral therapy of hepatitis B, drug combinations, particularly combinations without cross-resistance, can delay or prevent the emergence of drug-resistant mutants. Because drug-resistant mutants are archived and may limit future therapeutic options, prevention is important for long-term therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, combining drugs may achieve synergistic or additive antiviral effects compared with single drug therapy. Undesirable aspects of combination therapy include higher treatment costs and possibly lower adherence rates (due to pill number or complexity of regimen). Potentially harmful effects of combination therapy include higher rates of side effects, reduced efficacy due to drug competition, and the risk of multidrug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) if combination therapy is insufficient to prevent resistance. Combination therapy has been shown to reduce the rate of drug resistance in chronic hepatitis B, but only when drugs with a low barrier to resistance are used (lamivudine, adefovir). Combination therapies may achieve greater degrees of HBV DNA suppression, but this has not been associated with higher rates of seroconversion (hepatitis B e antigen or hepatitis B surface antigen) compared to single drug therapy. The benefit of combination therapy has yet to be demonstrated with agents that are associated with a high barrier to resistance (tenofovir, entecavir). The use of combination therapy is recommended in specific patient groups: those with decompensated cirrhosis, those coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus and HBV who are on antiretroviral therapy, those who have undergone liver transplantation, and those with drug-resistant HBV infection. There is insufficient evidence to recommend combination therapy as first-line therapy for all patients with chronic hepatitis B.

Etravirine (TMC125), a recently approved, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), has shown durable, superior virologic efficacy over placebo in the Phase III, randomized, double-blind DUET trials in 1,203 treatment-experienced, NNRTI-resistant, HIV-1-infected patients. Statistical significance of responses with etravirine over placebo was maintained through Week 24, 48 and 96, regardless of baseline demographics, baseline disease characteristics or the background regimen used. Etravirine has demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile; the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable with placebo in the DUET trials, with the exception of rash. The tolerability profile of etravirine also appears to be favorable in terms of neuropsychiatric and hepatic side effects. The pharmacokinetic profile of twice-daily etravirine minimizes the potential for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions and allows for its use in combination with a wide range of other agents. In addition, etravirine has a high genetic barrier to the development of resistance, further enhancing potential benefit in patients infected with NNRTI-resistant virus. The clinical efficacy and favorable safety profile of etravirine, together with its pharmacokinetic profile and high genetic barrier to resistance, make it a valuable treatment option for a wide range of treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients.

They were separated into 2 groups according to the administration of antiretroviral therapy into those who presented disease symptoms or without symptoms and no therapy. Viral genome sequencing reactions were loaded on an automated DNA sampler (TruGene, Visible Genetics) and compared to a database of wild type HIV-1. In the former group 8 of 12 children presented isolates with mutations conferring resistance to protease inhibitors (PIs), 7 presented isolates resistant to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and 2 presented isolates resistant to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Ten children were included in the antiretroviral na ve group. Eight were susceptible to NRTIs and all of them were susceptible to PIs; one presented the V108I mutation, which confers low-level resistance to NNRTIs. The data report HIV mutant isolates both in treated and untreated infants. However, the frequency and the level of drug resistance were more frequent in the group receiving antiretroviral therapy, corroborating the concept of selective pressure acting on the emergence of resistant viral strains. The children who presented alterations at polymorphism sites should be monitored for the development of additional mutations occurring at relevant resistance codons.

These variants are usually replaced by drug-sensitive ones when the selective pressure of the drugs is removed, as the former have reduced fitness in a drug-free environment. This was the rationale for the design of structured ARV treatment interruption (STI) studies for the management of HIV-1 patients with treatment failure. We have studied the origin of drug-sensitive HIV-1 quasispecies emerging after STI in patients with treatment failure due to ARV drug resistance. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples were obtained the day of treatment interruption (day 0) and 30 and 60 days afterwards. HIV-1 pol and env were partially amplified, cloned, and sequenced. At day 60 drug-resistant variants were replaced by completely or partially sensitive quasispecies. Phylogenetic analyses of pol revealed that drug-sensitive variants emerging after STI were not related to their immediate temporal ancestors but formed a separate cluster, demonstrating that STI leads to the recrudescence and reemergence of a sequestrated viral population rather than leading to the back mutation of drug-resistant forms. No evidence for concomitant changes in viral tropism was seen, as deduced from env sequences. This study demonstrates the important role that the reemergence of quasispecies plays in HIV-1 population dynamics and points out the difficulties that may be found when recycling ARV therapies with patients with treatment failure.

Retroviral vectors allowing neomycin phosphotransferase (npt) gene expression were engineered to express 5' sequences of HIV-1 RNA in the antisense or sense orientation and used to transform the human CD4+ lymphocyte-derived MT4 cell line. Cells expressing antisense or sense RNA to the HIV-1 tat mRNA leader sequence, as part of the 3' untranslated region of the npt mRNA, remained sensitive to HIV-1 infection. In contrast, resistance to HIV-1 infection was observed in cells expressing antisense RNA to the HIV-1 primer-binding site or to the region 5' to the primer-binding site as part of the 3' region of the npt mRNA. Cells expressing the tat mRNA leader sequence in the sense orientation as a precise replacement of the 5' untranslated region of npt mRNA were also resistant to HIV-1. These results indicate that sense and antisense approaches can be used to interfere with HIV-1 multiplication.

Raltegravir also provided clinicians with additional options for first-line therapy and for the simplification of regimens in patients with stable virological suppression. Two additional INIs in advanced clinical development-elvitegravir and S/GSK1349572-may prove equally versatile. However, the INIs have a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance in that 1 or 2 mutations are capable of causing marked reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir and elvitegravir, the most well-studied INIs. This perspective reviews the genetic mechanisms of INI resistance and their implications for initial INI therapy, the treatment of antiretroviral-experienced patients, and regimen simplification.

Primary and acquired antiretroviral resistance rates reflect the relative usage of different antiretroviral drugs in the population, as well as the inherent genetic barrier to the development of resistance associated with individual drugs. Data on antiretroviral resistance rates, gleaned from the growing HIV-1-infected population treated with a continuously increasing number of antiretroviral drugs and drug combinations, provide insights into patient management approaches for delaying the emergence of resistance and minimizing the degree of resistance. Evolving data suggest that the relative ease by which HIV-1 escapes the selective pressure of chronic drug exposure varies for the different antiretroviral drug classes and individual antiretroviral drugs. The development of resistance in vivo can be anticipated based on these data, in conjunction with the individuals treatment history and resistance testing results. These in turn can guide the judicious use of antiretroviral drugs to attain optimal treatment responses and to preserve therapeutic options for the time when antiretroviral-resistant strains emerge. The recent developments of new antiretroviral drugs, including the use of boosted protease inhibitors, suggest that treatment strategies can limit the development of resistance.

We carried out an assessment of a situationally focused individual HIV/STD reduction intervention (where avoidance of risk situations, as well as risk behaviors, are emphasized) in one Nigerian military unit (N = 1,222), with a comparable unit from the same service as a waiting list control (N = 987). The intervention consisted of a possible five modules that were presented to groups of up to 50 personnel. Data were collected on reported sexual behaviors, condom beliefs, sexual risk behaviors with casual partners, and number of interventions attended. Data indicated significant increases in reported condom use with casual partners and positive condom beliefs at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Risk behavior was reduced 30% from baseline at 6 months and 23% from baseline at 12 months. There was also a significant dose-response effect for number of interventions attended. These data suggest that relatively brief situationally focused individual interventions are effective in military and West African contexts in reducing HIV/STD risk behaviors.

Findings indicated that the health-risk appraisal and interactive video increased adherence with clinic recommendations to abstain from sex (chi(2)3199=19.67; P<.001) and increased readiness to change "risky" partner-selection behavior (chi(2)2194=6.42; P<.04). Follow-up data suggested that STD-related risk behavior was particularly resistant to change but that the single-session intervention had some impact, which could be viewed as a "priming" effect that enhances multisession interventions.

Influence of human immunodeficiency virus infection., Abstract: Control of genital ulcer disease (GUD) is a proposed intervention to slow the dissemination of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Programs for the control of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) should focus on groups of high-frequency transmitters, such as prostitutes and their clientele. This study illustrates the interaction between the prevalence of chancroid, use of barrier prophylaxis against STDs, and HIV infection in a population of female prostitutes in Nairobi. Four hundred and twenty three women were evaluated. Despite the increased use of condoms, the prevalence of genital ulcers remained constant between 1986-87 and 1987-88. Genital ulcer disease was simultaneously associated with HIV infection (adjusted odds ratio: 3.7, P less than .01) whereas it was independently and inversely associated with more consistent condom use (P less than .01). The authors conclude that genital ulcer disease can be controlled in these populations but concurrent HIV infection increases the difficulty of this intervention.

Gonorrhoea, chancroid, syphilis seroactivity, trichomoniasis, or objective signs of STD were found in 78%, and HIV seropositivity in 15% of men and 19% of women. Most women were married, living with a spouse; while most men were single, or married, but living separated from a spouse. Among married men, last sex was with a female sex worker (FSW) or casual partner for 60% not living with a spouse and 26% living with a spouse (P<0.005). Two or more partners during the past year were reported by 82% of men and 25% of women (P <0.001), and 55% of men and 11% of women reported the last partner was high risk. HIV seropositivity among both genders was associated with numbers of partners, and among women, with being widowed or divorced. Only 3% reported use of a condom with the last partner. Among men whose last sex was with a FSW, 74% said the reason for not using a condom was not having one. Thus, infrequent condom use, low condom availability, and gender differences in behaviour necessitate modifying development policies that separate families; and better coordination between family planning, PHC, and AIDS/STD programmes, with improved supply, social marketing and community-based distribution of condoms in high-risk settings for STD/HIV prevention.

The study subjects were 1,259 made up of sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic attenders, pregnant women, female prostitutes, and blood donors. Sera were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmation was done by Western blotting. The overall seroprevalence was 1.67% (21/1,259), with no significant differences from one population center to another. There were, however, significant differences among the population groups studied: prostitutes, 4.24%; STD clinic attenders, 1.67%; blood donors, 0.71%; and pregnant women, 0.24%. Of the 21 seropositives, 18 were positive for HIV-1 only; 1 was positive for HIV-2 only; and 2 were positive for both HIV-1 and HIV-2. All three HIV-2-positive sera were from prostitutes. Prevalence rates found in this study showed marked increases from 2 to 3 years earlier. There is therefore the need for a vigorous and sustained intervention program.

Despite this critical need, many do not follow prescribed regimens. To examine the barriers that lead to non-adherence, we used cross-sectional survey data from a randomized controlled intervention trial in northern and north-eastern Thailand. Of the 507 patients that were enrolled in the trial, we analyzed 386 patients on antiretroviral therapy in order to examine the barriers to adherence. In addition to demographic characteristics, depressive symptoms, physical health, access to care, social support, and internalized shame, HIV disclosure and family communication were examined. The correlation analysis revealed that adherence is significantly associated with internalized shame, access to care, depressive symptoms, and family communication. Based on the multiple logistic regression analysis, depressive symptoms, access to care, HIV disclosure, and family communication were significant predictors of adherence. Having depressive symptoms remains a significant barrier to adherence, while access to care, HIV disclosure, and family communication play important positive roles. Our findings underscore the critical importance of addressing these various challenges that can influence adherence to antiretroviral therapy.

High-risk partners were common, and nearly one-quarter of the sample had previously had STDs. Logistic regression models examined correlates of HIV exposure risk, of inconsistent condom use, and of having partners with increased risk of HIV infection. Frequent partner turnover, sex "binging," negative attitudes toward condom use, and engaging in sex during military leaves were important correlates of risk. Individuals with HIV infection risk behavior generally were cognizant of their risk for HIV infection. Implications for intervention are discussed.

In 1998 in Karachi, Pakistan, we studied the seroprevalence of HIV, HBsAg and syphilis and associated risk factors in Hijras. Study subjects were verbally administered a structured questionnaire that determined risk behaviours for sexually transmitted and blood-borne diseases and knowledge of AIDS/STDs. After pre-test counselling, verbal consent was taken for serological testing. The results were provided on a one-on-one post-test counselling session. Three hundred male transvestites were approached; all agreed to answer the questionnaire, 208 consented to blood testing. Of 300, 81% acknowledged commercial sex with men. Of 208, prevalence of syphilis was 37%; HBsAg 3.4%; HIV 0%. The prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is low in transvestite sex workers but that of syphilis is high. Intervention programmes implemented at this stage can have an impact on HIV and STD prevention.

The serological tests were done using the ELISA (Wellcozyme) and confirmed by the western blot (Biorad). Sixty (12%) of the 500 patients were HIV-1 antibody positive. Seropositivity varied with the type of STD. A positivity rate of 16% seen with genital ulcer disease is significantly higher than the 7% prevalence rate seen in STD patients with urethral discharge. Infection with more than one kind of STD increases seropositivity significantly. Of the potential risk factors identified during the interview it seems that only shaving at barbers' shop is positively associated with seroprevalence. This study suggests that the presence of STDs is associated with an increased HIV-1 seroprevalence. Therefore, any effort to reduce HIV-1 infection should aim at the control of STDs.

Sera were screened by Mixt HIV-1/HIV-2 commercial enzyme immunoassay and ELISA HTLV I/II. Each serum found positive by ELISA was confirmed by Western blot. A total of 2917 persons were interviewed, of whom 2754 (94.4%) agreed to participate and gave a blood sample. Twenty-eight were found to be HIV-1 antibody positive. The prevalence ranged from 0.25% in pregnant women to 2.9% in male CSWs. The prevalence was 1% in STD patients and 0.44% in Tb patients. None of the sera was found positive for HIV-2. The prevalence of antibodies to HTLV-1 varied from 0.12% in pregnant women to 1.21% in female CSWs. Five sera were positive for HTLV-II. These results confirm the hypothesis that the HIV epidemic in Northeastern Brazil is still limited to high risk groups. Repeated cross-sectional surveys of this type should be performed as a surveillance tool to study the dynamics of this epidemic in low prevalence areas. Defining risk factors should allow targeting of intervention strategies.

While the numbers of peripheral total white cells and percent lymphocytes declined from birth to adulthood, the percent CD3+ T lymphocytes was steady among all age groups studied. The numbers of CD3+ CD4+ (T-helper) cells decreased markedly after the first year of life, followed by a slower decline afterward and then a slight increase before adulthood. The trend for CD3+ CD8+(T-suppressor) cells, however, was an increase among individuals of all age ranges. The numbers of CD19+ CD3- (B cells) increased only during the first year of life and then declined steadily, while natural killer (NK) cells showed the opposite pattern. Comparison of the results with those of studies done with a Caucasian population showed that both peripheral T-helper and T-suppressor cell numbers were low after the first year of life in the Chinese pediatric population in comparison with those in a Caucasian pediatric population. Lower B-cell counts and higher NK-cell counts were seen after the first year of life in the Chinese population than in the Caucasian population. It is important that for each HIV-infected population normative ranges of the lymphocyte subset be established to monitor HIV-infected pediatric patients.

The incidence of AIDS was calculated in the general population and examined further according to gender, age (< or = or >49 years), and heterosexual behaviour as a risk factor for HIV. Multivariate analysis was used to identify variables associated with AIDS presenters (defined as patients diagnosed with AIDS within 1 month of the first HIV-positive test). The numbers of patients with AIDS classified as (i) AIDS presenters, (ii) known HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral treatment, and (iii) known HIV-positive patients not receiving antiretroviral treatment were calculated. The overall incidence of AIDS decreased over time, mainly due to the lower number of patients on antiretroviral treatment developing AIDS. Factors associated with a higher risk of being an AIDS presenter were male gender and year of HIV diagnosis. Among patients with AIDS, the proportion of AIDS presenters increased from 13.8% prior to 1997 (when protease inhibitors were introduced in Italy) to 32.5% after 1997. Variables predictive of being an AIDS presenter were male gender, age at diagnosis, and AIDS diagnosis in the years 1997-2000. Heterosexuals had a higher risk of being AIDS presenters and a lower risk of being HIV-positive and not receiving antiretroviral treatment than intravenous drug users. In Italy, AIDS occurs mainly in subjects unaware of their HIV status (especially males, the elderly, and those infected heterosexually) or in patients refusing antiretroviral therapy (mainly intravenous drug users who do not refer to specialised centres).

Conversely, EBV has been rarely associated with encephalitis in HIV patients. Here we describe for the first time the case of an HIV-infected, late presenter Caucasian man, diagnosed with a rapidly progressive diffuse encephalitis at presentation. A very high viral load for EBV was detected in CSF by PCR. The patient died 12 days after the onset of encephalitis in spite of supportive, antiviral and antiretroviral therapy. Our experience would suggest that in profoundly immunosuppressed HIV patients EBV may cause severe encephalitis in the absence of lymphoproliferative disorders.

One hundred eight patients underwent a total of 169 graft procedures; mean follow-up was 14 1/2 months. There were 18 (17%) patients who were HIV-positive who had no symptoms, 11 (10%) patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and 79 (73%) patients who were HIV-negative. Twenty-three percent (25/108) of patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA), most of whom also had either AIDS or asymptomatic HIV infection. Dialysis procedures included 44 autogenous reconstructions (26%), 117 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts (69%), and 8 (5%) procedures of unknown type. Arteriovenous fistula or graft thrombosis was a frequent complication. The overall 12-month graft patency rate was 41%, and patients with HIV infection or a history of IVDA did not have a significantly increased risk of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that the use of PTFE as opposed to autogenous reconstruction was the only significant risk factor found for occlusion within the first 12 months after operation (p < 0.01). Twenty-five graft infections occurred, all in PTFE grafts. The PTFE graft infection rate was 43% in patients with AIDS, 36% in patients who were HIV-positive and who had no symptoms, and 15% in patients who were HIV-negative (p < 0.05). Patients with a history of IVDA had a 41% PTFE graft infection rate versus a 13% infection rate in patients who did not have a history of IVDA (p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Patients were classified from stages 1-6 according to the immunological criteria of the Walter Reed staging system. Statistical analysis of psychometric data showed an effect of the stage of the disease on test performances, indicating a decline in attention, accumulation of perceptual interferences, decline in visuoperceptual speed and visuomotor response speed and reduced verbal memory performance, especially in stage 6 patients. Comparison of performance levels with normative test data already revealed cognitive deficits in about 20-30% of the patients in stages 2-5. As regards verbal memory, especially learning and recognition of new verbal information were impaired. In contrast, there was no significant deficit for nonverbal memory processing. Compared with the controls, patients exhibited an increasing number of abnormal EEG findings in stages 2-6. As a conclusion, in the stages before acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) develops, EEG findings as well as psychometric findings indicate central nervous system involvement of AIDS in about 20-30% of cases, whereas in full-blown AIDS there is a marked increase to 80%. Besides a more general deficit of attention and psychomotor speed as is seen in subcortical dementia, there is evidence for a particular verbal learning disorder, suggesting additional selective impairment of the brain.

In a sample of patients who had been prescribed protease inhibitors for the first time, the authors tested to see whether there was a minimal duration of CD4+ cell count increase before the increase had an impact on the occurrence of opportunistic infections. The evolution (difference between time t and baseline) of CD4+ cell count was modeled using a mixed effects linear model. Changes in CD4+ count estimated by this model were then included as time-dependent covariates in a proportional hazards model. Finally, the authors tested for the existence of a CD4+ change x time interaction. The authors used a sample of 553 French patients first prescribed protease inhibitors in 1996 and followed for a median of 16 months. During the first 120 days, there was no association between CD4+ change and the rate of opportunistic infections. After 120 days, each 50-cell/mm3 increase in CD4+ count was associated with a 60% (95% confidence interval: 45, 72) reduction in the incidence of opportunistic infections. These results, based on modeling of CD4+ cell response, at least indirectly reinforce the concept of a delayed but possible immune recovery with the use of protease inhibitors. The findings support the potential for interruption of certain types of prophylaxis against opportunistic infections under reasonable conditions of duration of antiretroviral therapy and sustained CD4+ cell response.

We retrospectively reviewed the annual number of outpatient visits to our HIV clinic, inpatient admissions for HIV disease, and first admissions for patients with cancer and HIV disease at our center between 1990 and 1997. Between 1990 and 1995, there was a progressive increase in the annual number of admissions for HIV disease and HIV-associated cancers that paralleled the increasing HIV clinic volume. In 1997, however, the annual number of first admissions for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma compared with 1995 decreased by 36% and 63%, respectively, despite a continued increase in the annual number of HIV clinic visits. Similar declines were also noted in the number of new cases of biopsy-confirmed KS and primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. In contrast, there was no decrease in the number of first admissions for patients with HIV infection and other cancers not typically associated with HIV infection. These findings suggest a declining incidence of HIV-associated malignancies since the introduction of HAART.

HBsAg and HBV DNA release into the medium was increased in the second week after infection. Via immunostaining, HBcAg was first observed in the nucleus of hepatocytes approximately 3 days after infection. A maximal percentage of HBcAg positive cells in 0.1% of cultured hepatocytes was detected on the 7th day. HBsAg was also first demonstrated on the 3rd day, and predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. About 5% of hepatocytes were HBsAg positive on the 12th day after infection. The percentage of positive cells did not appear to increase after this time. Using in situ cytohybridization and agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blot analysis, HBV DNA was first detected on the 4th day. In addition, electron microscopic studies revealed the presence of 42 nm virus-like particles in the cytoplasm of infected cells in the second week after infection. This in vitro system provides a model for studying the mechanism of HBV infection, viral replication and maturation. However, further improvement of culture systems is needed, to increase the number of infected cells and for active HBV replication.

Most patients responded to HAART [during the first 6 months, plasma HIV VL fell by a mean 1.39 log10, becoming undetectable (<400 copies/ml) in 22% and CD4+ T cells increased by a mean of 100 cells/microl], but surprisingly, 27 (54%) showed some rise and 25 (50%) showed a significant increase in the HCV VL. This figure was considered to be a minimum estimate. A majority of the patients showed an increase of less than 1 log10 that was associated with a rapid decrease in the HIV VL, whereas an increase in the HCV VL of greater than 1 log10, noted in eight patients, was associated with a baseline CD4+ cell count of less than 200 cells/microl. The increase in the HCV VL was not associated with hepatitis as determined by raised alanine transferase.

We describe four HIV-infected patients with pseudo-Cushing's syndrome, characterized by striking dorsocervical and submandibular fat accumulation and central obesity. In each case, cortisol levels were either normal or suppressed adequately with administration of dexamethasone, excluding the diagnosis of true Cushing's syndrome. Immune function and weight improved significantly preceding the development of pseudo-Cushing's syndrome. Three of the four patients were taking a common protease inhibitor at the onset of symptoms, and the fourth reported the exacerbation of his symptoms with the addition of a protease inhibitor. The observed characteristic pattern of fat deposition may be attributable to a specific effect of new antiretroviral therapies or may relate to recovery independent of medication usage. Distinguishing between pseudo-Cushing's syndrome and true Cushing's syndrome is critical for preventing the unnecessary and potentially harmful treatment of such patients. Further research into the mechanisms of this novel phenomenon is needed.

Whilst the number of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections has declined globally since 2000, there are still regions where new infection rates are rising, and diagnosing HIV early in the course of infection remains a challenge. Late presentation to care in HIV refers to individuals newly presenting for HIV care with a CD4 count below 350 cells/µl or with an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining event. Late presentation is associated with increased patient morbidity and mortality, healthcare costs and risk of onward transmission by individuals unaware of their status. Further, late presentation limits the effectiveness of all subsequent steps in the cascade of HIV care. Recent figures from 34 countries in Europe show that late presentation occurs in 38.3% to 49.8% of patients newly presenting for care, depending on region. In Switzerland, data from patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study put the rate of late presentation at 49.8% and show that patients outside established HIV risk groups are most likely to be late presenters. Provider-initiated testing needs to be improved to reach these groups, which include heterosexual men and women and older patients. The aim of this review is to describe the scale and implications of late presentation using cohort data from Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe, and to highlight initiatives to improve early HIV diagnosis. The importance of recognising indicator conditions and the potential for missed opportunities for HIV testing is illustrated in three clinical case studies.

The advent of high-performance quantitative HIV assays and highly active antiretroviral therapy were the two most important developments in HIV medicine. As a result, HIV mortality and morbidity have reduced significantly, although a proportion of HIV-infected patients are still diagnosed late. Management of HIV during pregnancy has also improved so that vertical transmission is now limited to less than 2% of all cases. Knowledge of the different stages of HIV infection enables optimal timing of start of antiretroviral therapy. Routine offering of HIV testing might also reduce the number of patients diagnosed with immunodeficiency. Better knowledge of the life cycle of HIV has made it possible to design new classes of antiretroviral drugs. The new drugs, however, pose new challenges as they might have long-term side effects. In addition, their interactions with other antiretroviral drugs might not be favourable.

The principal aim of the study was to gain an in-depth understanding of the factors contributing to adherence in patients taking highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). These insights were used in phase two to inform a number of interventions aimed at improving medication adherence in patients commencing HAART for the first time. The study comprised a cohort of 32 PLWHA over the age of 18 years who had taken HAART for at least three months. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used. The qualitative component used a multiple case study approach to explore and describe the experiences of patients receiving HAART. The quantitative component comprised the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale and a demographic survey of the respondents. This demographic data were used to provide descriptive statistics of the research population and assist with the interpretation of the qualitative data. The findings identified a number of social, clinical, and economic factors influencing adherence to HAART. These findings led to a number of recommendations that health care providers and policy-makers can implement to improve medication adherence rates in patients taking HAART. The findings demonstrated that improved adherence not only led to improved clinical outcomes, but also the overall quality of life of PLWHA.

Using pharmacy data routinely collected during 2004-2010, we calculated the number of late refills during the initial year of ART. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression to examine the association between the number of late refills and death or program failure (i.e., death, loss to follow-up, or program withdrawal) >12 months after ART initiation, with and without stratification by the medication possession ratio (MPR) during the initial year of ART. Of 53,015 adults who received ART for ≥12 months (median follow-up duration, 86.1 months; interquartile range, 53.2-128.2 months), 26,847 (50.6%) had 0 late refills, 16,762 (31.6%) had 1, 6,505 (12.3%) had 2, and 2,901 (5.5%) had ≥3. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that ≥3 late refills was associated with a greater mortality risk than 1 and 2 late refills (p<0.001, by the log-rank test). The mortality risk was greater for patients with 2 late refills [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99-1.38] or ≥3 late refills (adjusted HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.23-1.87), compared with that for patients with 0-1 late refills. Program failure was associated with ≥2 late refills. An MPR of <80% was associated with similar increases in mortality risk across late-refill strata. Monitoring late refills during the initial period of ART may help resource- and time-constrained clinics identify patients at risk for program failure.

This study explores reasons for late ART initiation among people living with HIV (PLHIV) from the perspectives of health care providers and PLHIV. The study was undertaken in six clinics from five provinces in Vietnam. Baseline CD4 counts were collected from patient records and grouped into three categories: very late initiators (≤100 cells/mm(3) CD4), late initiators (100-200 cells/mm(3)) and timely initiators (200-350 cells/mm(3)). Thirty in-depth interviews with patients who started ART and 15 focus group discussions with HIV service providers were conducted and thematic analysis of the content performed. Of 934 patients, 62% started ART very late and 11% initiated timely treatment. The proportion of patients for whom a CD4 count was obtained within six months of their HIV diagnosis ranged from 22% to 72%. The proportion of patients referred to ART clinics by voluntary testing and counselling centres ranged from 1% to 35%. Structural barriers to timely ART initiation were poor linkage between HIV testing and HIV care and treatment services, lack of patient confidentiality and a shortage of HIV/AIDS specialists. If Vietnam's treatment practice is to align with WHO recommendations then the connection between voluntary counselling and testing service and ART clinics must be improved. Expansion and decentralization of HIV/AIDS services to allow implementation at the community level increased task sharing between doctors and nurses to overcome limited human resources, and improved patient confidentiality are likely to increase timely access to HIV treatment services for more patients.

Preventing the development of neurocognitive abnormalities has become an increasingly important issue in this aging patient population, which is already at risk for cognitive impairment as a result of the neuropathological effects of HIV. cART has been critical in reducing the overall severity of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), but numerous challenges remain, as the prevalence of HAND continues to be high. There are several key areas in which treatment could be improved to reduce the incidence and severity of HAND. The use of well-tolerated cART medications that are able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier hold particular promise, as these agents may enable increased viral suppression in the parenchyma and may reduce neurocognitive dysfunction. In addition, the improved treatment of comorbid medical conditions that are common in patient populations with HIV (eg, HCV, liver failure and metabolic syndrome) is critical, as several of these conditions are known to have a significant effect on neural functions. Various research approaches indicate that the development of agents that control free radicals, neurotoxicity, proinflammatory processes and apoptosis may also have substantial potential in this field.

For those infected, social support is associated with improved medication adherence. Disclosure of infection status is likely a prerequisite for social support. However, little research describes patterns of HIV disclosure by infected persons. We retrospectively evaluated factors associated with disclosure among patients initiating HIV care at a university-based clinic from 2007 to 2012. Of 490 persons initiating care, 13 % had not disclosed their HIV infection to anyone. Black race significantly predicted non-disclosure and persons living with a significant other or friends were more likely to have disclosed their HIV infection versus those living alone. CD4 + T lymphocyte count <200 was associated with nondisclosure and disclosure only to family members. Future research is needed to better understand factors associated with disclosure of HIV infection status, because this could enhance receipt of social support and contribute to improved HIV health outcomes.

The lack of a widely available small-animal model has seriously hampered HIV research. In 2004, a new humanised mouse model was reported. It was based on the intrahepatic injection of human CD34+ cord blood cells into newborn, highly immunodeficient mice. These mice develop a lymphoid system of human origin and are highly susceptible to HIV infection and showed disseminated infection, persistent viraemia and characteristic helper CD4+ T-cell loss. Here, we will briefly review the various existing humanised mouse models and highlight their value to the study of HIV infection.

Information from in-depth interviews with individuals diagnosed with HIV in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (EW&NI) was analysed. Those diagnosed because of HIV-related symptoms (late diagnoses) were compared with those diagnosed for other reasons. Of the 286 individuals interviewed, 157 (55%) had HIV-related symptoms at the time of diagnosis, and 129 were tested for other reasons. A greater proportion of those diagnosed late were male and older. Of the 157 late diagnoses, 77 were considered to have acquired HIV heterosexually in the UK, 19 heterosexually abroad, 16 through 'high-risk' behaviours, 15 heterosexually by a 'high-risk' partner, four through blood transfusion and the remainder through an unusual or unknown route. A significantly higher proportion of those diagnosed late had had a long-standing relationship. None had been informed by a current or ex-partner of their HIV status. Primary care physicians should consider HIV as a possibility when patients without an apparent risk for HIV-infection present with symptoms indicative of possible immune suppression. Sensitive partner notification practices that enable a greater number of individuals to inform their partners should be explored.

We therefore examined the historical frequency of hepatitis B carriers in our unit, our vaccination program to hepatitis B virus (HBV), the response to hepatitis B vaccine, the IgG subclass response of anti-HBs and the response and IgG subclass response to pneumococcal vaccination (another vaccine) in dialysis patients. From 1970 and onwards 23 HBV carriers were found, but no new cases of hepatitis B occurred during the study period, i.e. from 1980 and onwards. Only one of the carriers was alive by the end of 2001. In four patients liver disease (in one of them liver cirrhosis) may have been a concomitant cause of death. The antibody response to hepatitis B vaccine was significantly lower in patients than in staff. In four patients a fourth injection was cancelled due to transplantation and bad health, while such data were lacking in 8 cases. In anti-HBs positive patients and controls a significant difference in the response of healthy adults was observed in anti-HBs IgG1 (p < 0.001) vs all other IgG subclasses. Dialysis patients had low levels, or negative findings, in all cases, with IgG1 as the highest proportion found (3/11 patients). An antibody response to pneumococcal vaccination was registered in 25 out of 29 dialysis patients (in all 86%). The IgG-subclass vaccination response to pneumococci in 28 dialysis patients was mainly IgG2 and IgG1 but also occurred in IgG3 and IgG4. Prevaccination antibody levels of the controls were higher in IgG1 and IgG2 (p < 0.01) (n = 21) than in dialysis patients (n = 28). Hepatitis B is nowadays a rare, but still dangerous disease in nephrology units. Dialysis patients have a reduced response to hepatitis B vaccine and vaccination schedules should be started early as some patients otherwise may not receive a fourth injection. The adequate antibody response to pneumococcal vaccination mainly due to IgG2 and IgG1 antibodies indicates that the antigen involved is important in vaccination responses in dialysis patients.

Patients on hemodialysis belong to the high-risk group of HCV infection. The prevalence of HCV infection in dialysis patients ranges from 4% to more than 70% in some countries. The main reasons for such a high incidence of infections are a high prevalence of HCV infection in the general population, lack of standard infection precautions and effective vaccination, inadequate disinfection procedures of dialysis machines and other medical equipment, as well as spread of infection from patient to patient, especially in dialytic centers with a high percentage of infected patients. The diagnostic procedures useful in the evaluation of HCV infection are detection of anti-HCV antibodies, identification of HCV RNA, counts of virus copies, and identification of its genome. From the 6 major genotypes and multiple subtypes of the HCV, genotypes 1a and 1b are the most common in Europe and Japan, and 1b is responsible for more severe liver disease and aggressive course leading to liver fibrosis. Antiviral therapy of HCV+ dialysis patients with interferon-alpha (INF-alpha) gives slightly better results than in the general population, but is poorly tolerated and associated with side effects. Although ribavirin in not recommended for dialysis patients, the addition of small doses of this compound to pegylated INF is discussed, especially for patients in whom previous infection treatment failed.
=> 3th document retrieved: Order: 15583, Title: Hepatitis C virus infection in haemodialysis and kidney transplant patients., Abstract: Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important global health problem. The prevalence of HCV is significantly higher in haemodialysis and kidney transplant patients, as compared to the general population. In spite of the relatively milder liver disease activity reported in HCV-infected haemodialysis patients, HCV infection adversely affects survival. Likewise, HCV has a detrimental effect on both patient and graft survival after kidney transplantation. However, patient survival is significantly better with kidney transplantation compared to remaining on dialysis; therefore, HCV infection alone should not be a contraindication to transplantation. Combination antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha and low-dose ribavirin is currently evolving in haemodialysis patients. Interferon-alpha (standard/pegylated) is relatively contraindicated after kidney transplantation because of an increased risk of allograft rejection. Therefore, antiviral treatment of transplant candidates while on dialysis remains the best option and may avoid the risk of HCV-associated liver and renal disease after transplantation. Large multi-centre clinical trials are required in HCV-infected haemodialysis and kidney transplant patients in order to define optimal therapeutic strategies before and after transplantation.

Being primary care physicians for the dialysis patients, nephrologists are frequently confronted with the management of HIV-infected dialysis patients especially in urban centers. The aims of the present review are to discuss issues that are unique to HIV infection and end-stage renal disease, and to provide dialysis caretakers with sufficient information to help them optimize care and improve outcomes of these patients. Issues related to the choice of renal replacement therapy, vascular access, management of anemia, vaccination, and antiretroviral therapies are discussed in detail.

However, resistance to currently available classes of antiretroviral drugs has become a problem, limiting the options for patients with advanced disease who have been heavily treated. Enfuvirtide (T-20; ENF), a synthetic peptide, is the first of a new class of antiretrovirals that block entry of virus into host cells. ENF interferes with conformational changes required for membrane fusion and injection of virus into the host cell. Optimal treatment of HIV infection will likely require combinations of drugs that target novel stages of HIV type 1 entry and replication.

Before the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy, acute kidney injury in HIV-positive patients was most commonly the result of volume depletion, septicemia, or nephrotoxic medications. Acute kidney injury remains a significant problem in the antiretroviral era, and still commonly is attributed to infection or nephrotoxic medications. Less common causes such as direct infectious insults, immune restoration inflammatory syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and obstruction should be considered when the underlying process is not obvious. In addition to advanced HIV disease, several other patient characteristics have emerged as potential risk factors for acute kidney injury in the antiretroviral era, including older age, diabetes, pre-existing chronic kidney disease, and hepatitis co-infection or liver disease.

In Poland are infected 11,181 people. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HART) has significantly prolonged the survival of HIV-positive patient. HIV infection can cause end-stage renal disease (ESRD) through both HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) and antiretroviral drug toxicity. Until recently, chronic dialysis (HD or PD) was the only form of treatment available for these patients. Kidney transplantation is an alternative method to dialysis and improve the quality of life in HIV-positive ESRD patients. In this article authors present the general information about HIV infection (epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment) as well as methods of therapy ESRD like hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and kidney transplantation.

The prevalence of HCV infection in hemodialysis (HD) patients and its associated risk factors is not well documented in our country. We therefore performed this study aiming to discuss prevention of further transmission of HCV infection among our patients. Between September 2003 and September 2005, 169 patients with end-stage renal failure on HD at the Renal Transplant Center, Medical City Teaching Hospital, Baghdad, were involved in this prospective study. There were 102 (60.4%) males, and 67 (39.6%) females, with age ranging from 14-67 years. Anti-HCV antibodies were positive in 12 of these patients (7.1%). Female gender, age >or = 60 years, dialysis duration < or = six months, history of having received blood transfusion(s), and < 9 hours per week of HD were significant predictors of anti-HCV positivity. We conclude that adherence to universal infection precautions, regular HCV screening of transfusions and of patients on HD and the use of separate machines for those who are anti-HCV positive, are important factors. To further reduce the prevalence in our patients, erythropoietin should replace blood transfusions as also testing for HCV RNA using polymerase chain reaction before starting HD.

Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative. Although she required hemodialysis, she was treated with prednisone and experienced a progressive decline in her serum creatinine from 10.1 mg/dL to 1.9 mg/dL, which permitted the discontinuation of hemodialysis. After she abruptly discontinued prednisone, her creatinine level increased to 4.8 mg/dL, and she experienced marked worsening of her nephrotic syndrome. Resumption of prednisone resulted in normalization of serum creatinine and reduction in urine protein excretion. No adverse effects of prednisone occurred during this time. She remains off of hemodialysis for 1 year with a serum creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL and urine protein excretion of 0.4 g/d. Although most patients with HIV infection, nephrotic-range proteinuria, and renal failure have FSGS, a minority may have membranous nephropathy. Although typically not a steroid-responsive lesion in the setting of advanced renal failure, membranous nephropathy may be a highly steroid-responsive lesion in the HIV-infected patient, and treatment may help avert the need for dialysis in a patient population that generally has a poor outcome on dialysis.

We describe a late hepatitis C virus (HCV) relapse with nearly identical HCV genotype 1a RNA, 14 months after a SVR achievement following a 12-month pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin treatment in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patient. This virological relapse occurred concomitantly with interruption of highly active antiretroviral therapy and subsequent increased immunosuppression. HCV retreatment was successful and HCV RNA was undetectable at 50 months of follow-up. This case suggests that late relapse of HCV infection in HIV-positive patients with SVR is possible in case of increased immunodeficiency related to highly active antiretroviral therapy interruption. In such circumstances, a close monitoring of HCV viremia and aminotransferases should be performed.

This study aimed to assess factors associated with late diagnosis of HIV infection in young people. It employed a hospital-based case-control design, conducted during January 2012 through August 2013. A total of 193 patients aged 18-25 years old from 21 hospitals across Thailand were studied. Late diagnosis was defined as presentation when the CD4 cell count was less than 350 cells/µL within 12 months of the first HIV diagnosis, or AIDS-defining event is present within 12 months of the first HIV diagnosis. Factors associated with the late diagnosis of HIV were those who: did not live with their parent (OR 3.87; 95% CI 1.40-10.66), had no children (OR 3.25; 95% CI 1.27-8.31), had their first sexual intercourse at age older than 18 years (OR 4.25; 95% CI 1.27-14.22), had same-age or older partners (OR 3.36; 95% CI 1.39-8.08), were substance users (OR 3.65; 95% CI 1.22-10.88), believed they changed their behaviors after receiving HIV education (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.02-5.99), and sought care at regional (OR 3.19; 95% 1.31-7.79) or general hospitals (OR 3.34; 95% 1.07-10.35). Strategies for early HIV detection in young people should be reconsidered; particularly the involvement of parents and targeting the right population.

However, the success of large-scale ART programmes depends on timely diagnosis and early initiation of HIV care. This study characterizes late presenters to HIV care in Santiago (Cape Verde) between 2004 and 2011, and identifies factors associated with late presentation for care. We defined late presentation as persons presenting to HIV care with a CD4 count below 350 cells/mm³. An unmatched case-control study was conducted using socio-demographic and behavioural data of 368 individuals (191 cases and 177 controls) collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire, comparing HIV patients late and early presented to care. Logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Results show that 51.9% were late presenters for HIV. No differences were found in gender distribution, marital status, or access to health services between cases and controls. Participants who undertook an HIV test by doctor indication were more likely to present late compared with those who tested for HIV by their own initiative. Also, individuals taking less time to initiate ART are more likely to present late. This study highlights the need to better understand reasons for late presentation to HIV care in Cape Verde. People in older age groups should be targeted in future approaches focused on late presenters to HIV care.

Follow-up investigations were performed in 80 patients with acute hepatitis B. Sera were examined for HBcAg. HBV DNA and conventional HBV markers. At the time of admission to hospital 34 of 80 (42%) patients were HBeAg positive. Twenty-six (76%) of the 34 HBcAg positive patients were HBV DNA positive, and circulating HBcAg was detectable in 25 of 34 (73%) HBcAg positive cases. In patients with uncomplicated courses of acute hepatitis B the serological HBcAg assay and HBV DNA became negative 1 to 8 weeks before elimination of HBeAg and up to 12 weeks earlier than the sera became negative for HBsAg. Five patients (6%) showed transition to chronic hepatitis B with persistence of HBsAg, HBeAg, HBV DNA and HBcAg in serum. One patient with acute hepatitis B and development of chronic hepatitis suffered from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and showed delayed formation of anti-HBc. In this case uncomplexed HBcAg was demonstrable during the acute phase of hepatitis B. With the appearance of anti-HBc HBcAg circulated in a complexed form. The data indicate that serological determinations of HBcAg and HBV DNA can serve as prognostic markers in the early phase of acute hepatitis B. The demonstration of uncomplexed HBcAg in serum of a patient with inadequate formation of anti-HBc supports the hypothesis that circulating HBcAg is usually complexed by specific antibodies.

Premature exposure to antiretrovirals may precipitate early evolution of resistance and unnecessary side-effects, whereas remaining off HAART until late in the course of HIV disease may lead to reduced therapeutic benefits and elevated mortality. The lack of a randomised clinical trial to consider this issue has resulted in ongoing revision of expert recommendations and substantial variability between international consensus guidelines regarding the optimal time to initiate therapy. Since this uncertainty is a source of unease for both patients and clinicians, we summarise the latest evidence regarding the optimal time to initiate HAART with consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks of starting HIV treatment at the different levels presently recommended in leading consensus guidelines.

Many reports have speculated on the possible linkage between these two conditions, yet never before data driven from a large national database was utilized in order to investigate this issue. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between SLE and hepatitis B carrier state. Patients with SLE were compared with age- and sex-matched controls regarding the proportion of hepatitis B carrier state in a case-control study. Chi-square and t tests were used for univariate analysis, and a logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. The study was performed utilizing the medical database of Clalit Health Services. The study included 5018 lupus patients over the age of 20 years and 25,090 age- and sex-frequency-matched controls without SLE. The proportion of hepatitis B carriers was higher in SLE patients as compared to controls (0.9 and 0.56 %, respectively; p < 0.001). A significant association was also observed among patients in lower socioeconomic status. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, SLE was significantly associated with hepatitis B (OR = 1.828, 95 % CI = 1.291-2.590). Patients with SLE have a greater proportion of hepatitis B carrier state than matched controls.

In this respect, in collaboration with the Italian Lymphoma Foundation we developed a descriptive study of the real-life approach of physicians caring for patients with these diseases. A questionnaire was designed to explore the perception of HBV reactivation-related issues. Fifty-nine Italian Lymphoma Foundation-affiliated institutions participated, and 504 questionnaires were sent out. Forty institutions (67.8%) returned 154 (30.5%) completed questionnaires. The largest majority (91.5%, 141/154) were aware of possible HBV reactivation as a consequence of immunosuppression. Most of the participants providing an answer (93.3%; 126/135) performed universal screening, and were aware of strategies for managing reactivation (96.4%, 132/137). Specialists treating lymphoma show a high level of awareness concerning the management of HBV reactivation under immunosuppression. However, uncertainties regarding the issue of HBV reactivation still emerge in this setting, and thus continuing collaborative effort between hepatologists and hematologists is necessary.

Our study aimed to examine how adherence to medication is associated with viral breakthrough in patients treated with NAs. A total of 203 patients (135 ETV and 68 LAM) were analyzed in this retrospective analysis. Physical examination, serum liver enzyme tests, and hepatitis B virus marker tests were performed at least every 3 months. We reviewed medical records and performed medical interviews regarding to patients' adherence to medication. Adherence rates <90% were defined as poor adherence in the present study. Cumulative viral breakthrough rates were lower in the ETV-treated patients than in the LAM-treated patients (P<0.001). Seven ETV-treated (5.1%) and 6 LAM-treated patients (8.8%) revealed poor adherence to medication (P=0.48). Among ETV-treated patients, 4 (3.1%) of 128 patients without poor adherence experienced viral breakthrough and 3 (42.8%) of 7 patients with poor adherence experienced viral breakthrough (P<0.001). Only 3 of 38 (7.8%) LAM-treated patients with viral breakthrough had poor adherence, a lower rate than the ETV-treated patients (P=0.039). Nucleoside analogue resistance mutations were observed in 50.0% of ETV- and 94.1% of LAM-treated patients with viral breakthrough (P=0.047). Viral breakthrough associated with poor adherence could be a more important issue in the treatment with especially stronger NAs, such as ETV.

Co-infection results in increased HCV replication and more rapid rates of liver disease progression. The effect of HIV combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) on HCV replication has not been studied in depth. To address this issue, we enrolled a small cohort of HCV/HIV co-infected patients into a cART initiation trial and used dynamic modeling combined with evaluation of immune responses and microarray profiles to determine how effective treatment of HIV affects HCV. Treatment with cART resulted in increased HCV replication and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in a subset of patients. Subjects with evidence of hepatic injury (increased ALT) were more likely to have HCV-specific immune responses directed against HCV epitopes. Over time, HCV viral loads declined. Reproducible and biologically important gene expression changes occurred in co-infected patients who underwent successful cART. The effective suppression of HIV by cART initiated a cascade of early and late events in treated patients. Early events involving down-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes may have led to transiently increased viral replication and hepatic injury. At later time points, HCV viral load declined to levels comparable to those seen in the setting of HCV monoinfection. These findings support early antiretroviral therapy in those with HCV/HIV co-infection.

Although frequently accompanied by local inflammatory reactions detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), CNS HIV-1 infection usually is not clinically apparent. In a minority of patients, CNS HIV-1 infection evolves into encephalitis during the late stages of systemic infection, which compromises brain function and presents clinically as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome dementia complex (ADC). Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has had a major impact on all aspects of CNS HIV-1 infection and disease. In those with asymptomatic infection, ART usually effectively suppresses HIV-1 in CSF and markedly reduces the incidence of symptomatic ADC. In those presenting with ADC, ART characteristically prevents neurological progression and leads to variable, and at times substantial, recovery. Similarly, treatment has reduced CNS opportunistic infections. With better control of these severe disorders, attention has turned to the possible consequences of chronic silent infection and the issue of whether indolent, low-grade brain injury might require earlier treatment intervention.

The role of NK cells in the acute response to human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infected cells was investigated in a mouse model based on a HIV-1/murine leukemia virus (MuLV) pseudovirus. Splenocytes infected with HIV-1/MuLV were injected intraperitoneally and local immunologic responses and persistence of infected cells were investigated. In vivo depletion with an anti-NK1.1 antibody showed that NK cells are important in resistance to virus infected cells. Moreover, NK cell frequency in the peritoneal cavity increased in response to infected cells and these NK cells had a more mature phenotype, as determined by CD27 and Mac-1 expression. Interestingly, after injection of HIV-1/MuLV infected cells, but not MuLV infected cells, peritoneal NK cells had an increased cytotoxic activity. In conclusion, NK cells play a role in the early control of HIV-1/MuLV infected cells in vivo.

On two occasions (at 0 and 6 months), saliva was collected for anonymous HCV antibody testing and risk behavior data were obtained through a self-administered questionnaire. The participation rate was 85% at both initial recruitment (612/719) and follow-up (375/441; 171 men were ineligible for follow-up). For inmates who reported never having injected drugs, ever having injected drugs, having injected drugs during follow-up, and having shared needles/syringes during follow-up, HCV incidences per 100 person-years of incarceration risk were 1, 12, 19, and 27, respectively. Ever having injected drugs (relative risk = 13.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.5, 114.3) and having shared needles/syringes during follow-up (relative risk = 9.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 71.7) were significantly associated with HCV seroconversion. The effectiveness of existing interventions, including the provision of bleach tablets for sterilizing injection equipment, was suboptimal. The development of methadone maintenance programs in prisons and the creation of drug courts to keep offending drug injectors out of prison might help to reduce transmission in this setting.

This antiviral effect showed dose-dependence up to 5.0 mg/kg and this dose seemed effective to obtain significant antiviral effect. Viral DNA and DNA polymerase activity were reduced significantly from the 1st week after starting the administration of Ara-A. This antiviral effect was maintained even at the 1st week after discontinuation of the drug. These findings were quite similar to those observed in HBV carriers. With the increasing necessity of Ara-A treatment in patients who will not respond to interferon therapy, DHBV seemed a suitable model for the investigation of the dose and antiviral effect of Ara-A treatment in humans.

The present investigation was undertaken to ascertain whether the low tumorigenicity of this cell line was governed by a host immune response and/or was related to expression of HBsAg. Subcutaneous injection of 4-5 X 10(6) cells into BALB/c nude mice produced localized encapsulated tumors with morphologic features of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in 25% of the animals within 29-40 d. No tumor growth was observed at lower cell inocula. In contrast, SK-HEP-1, an HBV-negative human hepatoma cell line, produced tumors at 1-5 X 10(6) cells inocula in 66% of the animals. Immunosuppression of mice with antilymphocyte serum (ALS) or irradiation increased tumor incidence in mice inoculated with 1 X 10(6) PLC/PRF/5 cells to almost 100% and produced local invasiveness. Immunosuppression also reduced the latency, i.e., time to tumor appearance, and increased mean tumor weight. These results suggest that tumorigenicity was limited by the host immune response. The nature of the response was delineated by treating nude mice challenged with tumor cells with sheep anti-mouse interferon globulin (anti-IFN). When 2 X 10(6) cells were injected, tumor growth occurred in 75% of anti-IFN-treated mice, whereas controls injected with the same number of cells, but not receiving anti-IFN, failed to develop tumors. The tumors in the anti-IFN-treated mice were highly invasive and the latency period until tumor appearance was reduced to 3-5 d. An inverse correlation was found between susceptibility of the hepatoma cells to natural killer (NK) activity in vitro and resistance to tumor growth in vivo. In vitro cytotoxicity for PLC/PRF/5 cells was eliminated by anti-NK 1.1 and complement, establishing the effector cell as an NK cell. NK cell activity 14 d after inoculation of mice with PLC/PRF/5 cells was augmented against PLC/PRF/5 target cells but not against SK-HEP-1 cells. Treatment of mice with ALS, irradiation, or anti-IFN abolished NK activity against PLC/PRF/5 cells. Co-cultivation of nude mouse spleen cells with PLC/PRF/5 but not with HBsAg or SK-HEP-1 cells induced secretion of murine IFNalpha. These results suggest that the IFN/NK cell system may play a role in limiting tumorigenicity and invasiveness of HBV-infected human hepatocellular carcinoma cells by a mechanism similar to that found for other cells persistently infected with viruses.

Although CD4 counts increased in all subjects in response to ART, we observed a restoration of functional plasmacytoid DC (PDC) after 52 wk of sustained suppression under ART (from 1850 cells/ml to 4550 cells/ml) to levels comparable to controls (5120 cells/ml) only in subjects with a low baseline viral load, which also rapidly suppressed to <50 copies/ml upon <or=60 days from ART initiation. Recovery of PDC at week 52 correlates with level of CD95 expression on CD8 T cells and PDC frequency following first ART suppression. NK cytotoxic activity increased rapidly upon viral suppression (VS) and correlated with PDC function at week 52. However, restoration of total NK cells was incomplete even after 52 wk on ART (73 cells/mul vs 122 cells/mul in controls). Direct reconstitution experiments indicate that NK cytotoxic activity against virally infected target cells requires DC/NK cooperation, and can be recovered upon sustained VS and recovery of functional PDC (but not myeloid DC) from ART-suppressed subjects. Our data indicate that viremic HIV-infected subjects may have different levels of reconstitution of DC and NK-mediated function following ART, with subjects with lower initial viremia and the greatest reduction of baseline immune activation at VS achieving the greatest level of innate effector cell reconstitution.

We investigated the noncytolytic anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity of NK cells in chronically HIV-infected immune cells. Supernatants collected from NK cell cultures (both primary NK cells and NK cell lines, YTS and NK 92) inhibited HIV activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIV-infected subjects. NK supernatants (NK SN) also suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced HIV activation in chronically infected cell lines (U1 and ACH-2 cells). The antibody to interferon (IFN)-gamma blocked NK SN-mediated anti-HIV effect, while the antibodies to CC-chemokines had no impact on NK SN-mediated HIV inhibition in U1 and ACH-2 cells. Investigation of mechanism(s) responsible for the NK action showed that NK SN inhibited TNF-alpha-mediated activation of HIV-long-terminal repeat (LTR), and upregulated the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1 and phosphorylated P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The P38 MAPK inhibitor (SB 203580) blocked NK SN-mediated HIV inhibition. These data provide compelling evidence that NK cells have a critical role in controlling HIV activation in the reservoirs.

The frequency and phenotype of circulating T(regs) (defined as CD3(+) CD4(+) CD25(high) or CD3(+) CD4(+) FOXP3(+)) and NK cells (CD3(-) CD16(+)/CD56(+)) were evaluated at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. The expression of CD25, CTLA-4, and granzymes A and B by CD4(+) FOXP3(+) cells, as well as the expression of KIR receptors (NKB1, CD158a, and NKAT2) on NK cells, was evaluated. Low doses of IL-2 resulted in the augmented frequency and absolute number of T(regs) in coinfected individuals. FOXP3 levels per cell as well as augmented CD25 and CTLA-4 expression by T(regs) suggested that IL-2 may lead to both expansion and activation of T(regs), although changes in the proportion of CD4(+) FOXP3(+) cells were not associated with changes in HCV viral load and CD4(+) cells between baseline and week 12. NK cell frequency also increased after IL-2 therapy. Interestingly, the pattern of expression of KIR receptors was changed by IL-2 treatment, since the frequency of NK cells expressing NKB1 augmented whereas the frequency of NK expressing CD158a and NKAT2 decreased.
=> 8th document retrieved: Order: 12421, Title: Natural killer cells are persistently infected and resistant to direct killing by HIV-1., Abstract: We have reported the presence of a CD4+ subpopulation of Natural Killer cells (NK) in humans. These cells also express HIV coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4 and are infectable by HIV-1. Infection is productive and persistent in vitro and in vivo. Infected people under therapy have evidence of viral DNA in their NK pool. In vitro experiments show that the NK compartment is important for virus propagation, since HIV-1 growth is significantly reduced in PBMC depleted of NK cells. This reduction was observed for both R5 and X4 molecular clones of HIV-1. In addition, evidence is presented demonstrating that infected NK cells are killed less efficiently by the virus as compared to T cells. This is reminiscent of macrophage infection, where the virus-infected cells survive for long periods of time. Therefore, few infected NK cells may contribute significantly to the infectious virus produced in vitro. These results further underscore the importance of NK infection for understanding pathogenic mechanisms leading to AIDS, as well as the various reservoirs and sanctuaries for HIV upon antiretroviral treatment.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 87 patients undergoing liver transplantation for hepatitis B-related liver disease were enrolled in this multicenter, phase III, open-label, single-arm study. Seventy (80.5%) of the 87 enrolled patients completed the study during the 52-week study period. Hepabulin (10,000 units) was intravenously injected intraoperatively, daily for 1 week, weekly for 1 month, and then once per month. Hepabulin was used as monotherapy without antiviral agents. Hepatitis B recurrence was defined as conversion from negativity for surface antigen after HBIG administration to positivity. RESULTS There were no cases of hepatitis B recurrence during the 52-week observation period. A total of 876 adverse events (AEs) that occurred during the study period were observed in 83 (95.4%) of 87 patients, and serious AEs were seen in 119 cases in 44 (50.6%) of the 87 patients. None of the AEs showed a relationship with this drug. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) rapidly disappeared within 1 week after HBIG administration, but hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA persisted for up to 8 weeks after surgery, which was related to HBV viral load. Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) was correlated with HBIG (Hepabulin) dose. CONCLUSIONS The new HBIG, Hepabulin, was shown to be safe and effective in preventing the recurrence of HBV after liver transplantation.

Seven haemophiliacs, coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), received 9 mega-units (MU) of natural IFN-alpha daily during the first 2 weeks and then three times a week for 22 weeks, all injected subcutaneously. Six patients were receiving zidovudine (AZT) 600 mg day-1 and didanosine (ddI) 200 mg day(-1) during IFN therapy. This treatment was safe and well tolerated. Four patients had no detectable serum HCV-RNA at the end of therapy, but long-term, none of the seven patients achieved a sustained response, i.e. undetectable serum HCV-RNA with persistently normal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 6 months after therapy. IFN did not affect CD4-positive cell counts. Most of our patients had high HCV-RNA loads and/or low CD4 counts, both unfavourable markers for IFN therapy. In conclusion, IFN therapy did not eradicate HCV from haemophiliacs coinfected with HIV.

We examined the prevalence and covariates of injecting drug use among men participating in the Sydney Gay Community Periodic Survey between 2004-06 and 2011. In 2004-06, data was collected about which drugs were injected, while in 2011, data was collected about hepatitis C (HCV) and esoteric sexual practices. In 2004-06, 5.6 % of men reported injecting drugs in the previous 6 months; 3.4 % reported methamphetamine injection and 0.4 % heroin injection. In 2011, men who injected drugs were less likely to be employed full-time, and more likely to be HCV-positive, HIV-positive, to have used party drugs for sex, and to have engaged in esoteric sexual practices. The strong associations between injecting drug use, sexual risk practices and blood-borne virus infection suggests the need for combined sexual health and harm reduction services for gay and bisexual men who inject drugs.

Approximately 60 days after HIV exposure by sex with another man, the patient abruptly had high fever, after which he experienced a variety of severe, prolonged symptoms such as painful oral mucosa ulcerations, rash, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and a 5.5-kg weight loss. Serum lactate dehydrogenase and liver biochemical test values were elevated. Antibodies to HIV by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot (WB) test were negative at the time of symptom onset, but serum HIV-1 RNA level was 1 585 000 copies/ml. Antibody seroconversions were found on day 9 after the onset of symptoms by ELISA and on day 16 by WB test, suggesting primary HIV infection. Within 2 weeks of starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), all symptoms except lymphadenopathy were resolved, and the serum HIV-1 RNA level dramatically decreased to 5011 copies/ml, eventually becoming undetectable by the standard method. The patient has remained asymptomatic for the 18 months since symptom resolution after HAART, and HIV-1 RNA remains undetectable.

Patients were followed up for a median of 61 months after infection, the dates of infection being either known exactly or estimated from the interval between the last negative and first positive HIV antibody test result. The rate of progression to AIDS was significantly higher for the transfusion recipients than for the haemophiliacs. The difference in time to the occurrence of the first clinical symptom was less pronounced between the two groups, though pointing in the same direction. The results suggest that on average roughly half of all patients positive for HIV will develop some clinical sign or symptom within five to six years after infection.

Using the Andersen Behavioral Model of Health Services Use, the authors determined whether minorities, women, and the less educated (vulnerable groups) were less likely to receive care for HIV symptoms. Persons enrolled in the HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study were asked whether they received care for their most bothersome symptom. Surprisingly, minorities and women were no more likely to go without care than other groups. Those with Medicaid, Medicare, private health maintenance organization (HMO) insurance, or no insurance were less likely to receive care for symptoms than those with private-non-HMO insurance. Vulnerable groups were no less likely to use services for HIV-related symptoms when need for care was considered. However, disparities may exist for symptom-specific care among HIV infected persons covered by public or HMO insurance.

However, HIV-1 can persist in a latent form in resting CD4+ T cells. We measured the decay rate of this latent reservoir in 34 treated adults whose plasma virus levels were undetectable. The mean half-life of the latent reservoir was very long (43.9 months). If the latent reservoir consists of only 1 x 10(5) cells, eradication could take as long as 60 years. Thus, latent infection of resting CD4+ T cells provides a mechanism for lifelong persistence of HIV-1, even in patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy.

These cases showed dementia, bradykinesia, dysarthria, hemiparesis, and so on. All of the cases were severely immunocompromised hosts, because none had more than 150/mm3 CD4 + lymphocytes; indeed, 5 of the cases were below 20/mm3. Other neurological complications except PML were primary CNS lymphoma, HIV encephalitis, and CMV encephalitis. The mean life durations was 7.6 months after the first symptom appeared, for all but one of the patients; the exceptional patient lived for 24 months after. Autopsy studies of the central nervous systems were performed for 7 cases, all of which showed extensive demyelinating lesions of the white matter, and in some cases these extended into the spinal cord. In contrast to Western countries, in Japan there have been few reports of AIDS-associated PML. Thus, this report was thought to be important here.

The advent of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) has dramatically reduced the progression of HIV/AIDS, so that these individuals live longer, with nearly undetectable viral loads, and thus may develop obesity and similar obesity-related comorbidity as occurs in the general population. However, HAART also causes lipodystrophy, placing these patients at increased risk for coronary artery disease.

In-depth interview and observational data were collected from a subset of the sample. The physical and psychological health of individual family members was assessed by the 53-item Brief Symptom Inventory. Parents, siblings, and people living with AIDS (PWAs) reported higher levels of overall distress and scored higher on symptom dimensions and clinically discrete symptoms than normative comparison groups. Implications of these findings for research, clinical practice, and health and social service policy are identified and discussed.

Focus group, a qualitative research method, was used to study these barriers. The study was conducted in 1998 on Long Island, NY, at five institutions that provide services to 1700 PLWHIV/AIDS. Five focus groups were conducted with 6 to 13 PLWHIV/AIDS in each group, a total of 39 subjects. PLWHIV/AIDS identified eight common barriers to adherence to HAART. In descending order, the barriers include: (1) frequency and severity of side effects, (2) conflicts with daily routines, (3) dietary requirements, (4) frequency of taking medications, (5) number and dosage of medications, (6) psychosocial factors (i.e., stress, feeling good, and bad news), (7) pharmacy refills, and (8) physiological needs (i.e., sleep, hunger, or thirst). Many factors play a role in the success or failure of HAART, including preexisting drug resistance, drug-drug interactions, and the ability of PLWHIV/AIDS to adhere to a rigid and frequently changing medication regimen. The information gleaned from focus groups is limited in that it may not be generalized to a larger population with any known reliability. However, clinicians sensitive to barriers to adherence to HAART, including those identified by PLWHIV/AIDS in this study, may play a more proactive role in supporting adherence to the medication regimen, increasing the durability of effective viral suppression, decreasing morbidity and mortality, and decreasing the selection and transmission of resistant strains of HIV.

Risk was estimated based on a model involving three probabilities: A, the probability that the surgeon will sustain a percutaneous injury during an invasive procedure; B, the probability that the sharp object causing the injury and now contaminated with the surgeon's blood will contact the patient's wound; and C, the probability that infection would be transmitted to the patient after such an exposure. The probability of transmission during one procedure is p = A x B x C. The probability of transmission to at least one patient during N procedures is 1-(1-p)N. Values for A, B, and C were estimated from prospective studies. The estimated probability of transmission from an infected surgeon to a patient during a single procedure is 0.00024-0.0024% for HIV and 0.024-0.24% for HBV if the surgeon is positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). The estimated probability of transmission to at least one patient during 3,500 procedures (estimated to be performed during an HIV-infected surgeon's remaining working life) is 0.81-8.1% for HIV; 57-100% for HBV if the surgeon is an HBeAg carrier. These estimates represent population averages and may not necessarily apply to a particular procedure performed by a particular surgeon, for which the risk may be considerably lower or higher than the estimated average. This risk assessment, which is based on limited data and does not take clusters of transmission into account, predicts that the risk of sporadic HBV transmission from infected surgeons to patients due to percutaneous injury during an invasive procedure is small and that the risk of HIV transmission is less than that for HBV. More data are needed to understand both sporadic and epidemic transmission in order to further reduce patient risk.

In Taiwan, the biomedical research and healthcare professionals' perspectives have dominated research related to HIV/AIDS. The purpose of the study was to investigate the stressors experienced by patients which have, thus far, been under-explored. This study used a phenomenological approach to gain insight into the patients' experience. In-depth, open-ended interviews were used to collect data. Interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim to maintain data integrity and to reduce perceptual bias. The open coding procedure was used to analyze the interview transcripts. Study participants were 14 male patients with an average age of 35.71 year-old, who had known their positive HIV status for an average of 24.9 months. Patients experienced multiple stressors because of having the life threatening illness of HIV/AIDS. Their stressors were identified as follows: being confronted with the diagnosis, fear of disclosure, unpredictability of their physical condition, hypervigilance toward physical symptoms, emotional upheaval, and constrained life planning. The findings of this study form the basis for professionals to design services particularly addressed to patients' needs, for example, informed testing, and pre- and post-counseling. Further efforts could focus on developing systemic intervention programs to help patients better cope with the challenges of living with HIV/AIDS.

The new 2006 estimates released by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), supported by UNAIDS and WHO, indicate that national adult HIV prevalence in India is approximately 0.36%, which corresponds to an estimated 2 million to 3.1 million people living with HIV in this country. The positive rate of HIV tested persons has shown a rising trend. So, a study was conducted on patients attending the surgery department for different operative procedures and 13 patients were HIV reactive out of 1697 patients tested. Routine HIV testing is usually not carried out at most centres and the medical fraternity is constantly exposed to the risk of HIV infection which can have wide-ranging implications in a health professional's life. HIV testing should be insisted on every patient before undertaking any surgical procedure routinely.

HIV surveillance data were reviewed for adults and adolescents (ages ≥13 years) living with HIV in 2008. Variables analyzed included demographics, region of origin (for persons born outside of the U.S.), insurance coverage, linkage to and continuous HIV care. Of the 16,513 DC residents living with HIV diagnoses, 1,391 (8.4%) were foreign-born. Of foreign-born infected, 71.9% were male; 33.3% were from Africa and 20.8% from Central America; 80.6% were exposed through sex; 36.3% had health coverage at diagnosis. While 100% of foreign-born persons had documented linkage to HIV care, only 18.0% had documentation of continued HIV care. These data suggest that strengthening continuous HIV care support after successful care linkage is warranted for foreign-born persons living with HIV in DC.

This study was to determine the prevalence, distribution of HBV, and factors associated with infection in an apparently healthy population in Nigeria. A cross-sectional study among the general population was conducted employing a multistage sampling technique. Data on demographic, social, and behavioral indicators were collected using questionnaires and blood samples tested for HBV seromarkers. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were done. Prevalence of hepatitis B infection was 12.2% (confidence interval [CI] = 10.3-14.5). Of the participants, more than half, 527 (54.6%), had evidence of previous exposure to HBV, while 306 (31.7%) showed no serologic evidence of infection or vaccination. Only 76 (7.9%) participants showed serologic evidence of immunity to HBV through vaccination. Factors associated with testing positive for HBV infection were dental procedure outside the health facility (odds ratios [OR] = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.52-7.70), local circumcision (OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.17-2.57), and uvulectomy (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.06-2.57). With logistic regression, only dental procedure outside the health facility (adjusted OR = 3.32, 95% CI = 1.38-7.97) remained significant. This first national survey on seroprevalence of hepatitis B describes the epidemiology and high prevalence of HBV infection in Nigeria and highlights the need for improved vaccination against HBV.

In an attempt to shed light on the dynamics of chronic infection, we measured the levels of TTV in the plasma of 25 persistently infected patients during the first 3 months of alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) treatment for concomitant hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The first significant decline of TTV loads was observed at day 3 versus day 1 for HCV. Subsequently, the loads of TTV became progressively lower in most patients, but some initial responders relapsed before the end of the follow-up, suggesting that at least in some subjects the effects of IFN on TTV can be very short-lived. No correlation between the responses of TTV and HCV to therapy was found. Fitting the viremia data obtained during the first week of treatment into previously developed mathematical models showed that TTV sustains very active chronic infections, with over 90% of the virions in plasma cleared and replenished daily and a minimum of approximately 3.8 x 10(10) virions generated per day. Low levels of TTV were occasionally detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients who had cleared plasma viremia, thus corroborating previous results showing that these cells may support TTV replication and/or persistence.

Nevertheless, we still lack enough data to determine the reasons why approximately 10% of the performed sperm washes remain positive, thus forcing the repetition of the treatment. Semen quality in infected males is also essential to these procedures. We aimed to determine the predictive value of the semen parameters, sperm washing procedure and the infection status for the post-wash viral positivity, as well as the correlation between the semen and the disease features.

However, the mechanisms implicated in bone mass loss in HIV infection are unclear. Because of this, we analyzed serum free testosterone and vitamin D3 hydroxylated metabolites in HIV-infected patients, with and without antiretroviral treatment, and the relation between them and osteopenia. Seventy-four HIV-infected patients were selected because they had frozen sera available at a date close to a DEXA evaluation. Free testosterone, 25(OH)D3, and 1,25(OH)2D3 were determined in frozen serum. There were no differences in free testosterone, 25(OH)D3, and 1,25(OH)2D3 levels between patients with and without osteopenia. 25(OH)D3 levels in naive and HAART-treated patients were 26.2 (10.3-32.8) and 33.1 (20.6-46.8) ng/ml, respectively (p = 0.04). 1,25(OH)2D3 levels in naive and HAART treated patients were 60.3 (49.2-80.8) and 85.5 (68-111.6) pmol/liter (p = 0.01). Free testosterone levels in 9 naive men and in 50 HAART-treated men were 42.6 (24.1-67.3) and 69.2 (47.5-112.1) pmol/liter, respectively (p = 0.04). In conclusion, HIV-infected patients with and without osteopenia showed similar levels of vitamin D metabolites and free testosterone. However, antiretroviral drug-naive patients showed lower serum levels of vitamin D metabolites and free testosterone than HAART-treated patients.

However, the prevalence of hypogonadism is not known among men with weight loss related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). From 1997 through 1999, we investigated total and free testosterone levels in 90 men who were <90% of ideal body weight or had weight loss of >10% from preillness weight; 71% of these subjects were receiving HAART. Twenty-one percent of the subjects receiving HAART had low free testosterone levels. No correlation was seen between weight, CD4 cell count, medication status, and other clinical factors. These data suggest that hypogonadism remains relatively common in men with AIDS wasting, despite treatment with HAART. HIV-infected men with wasting syndrome should be screened for hypogonadism and receive physiological androgen replacement therapy if they are hypogonadal.

Between February and March 2007, blood samples were collected in Pemba Island and Tosamaganga from 336 outpatients and sent to the Virology Laboratory in Rome (Italy) for testing. HHV-8 DNA and HBV-DNA were amplified by two in-house molecular methods, anti-HHV-8 antibody titers were determined by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and anti-HCV, HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc were evaluated by microplate enzyme immunoassay (MEIA). The seroprevalence of HHV-8 was 30.7% (96/313). In Pemba Island, the prevalence was lower than in Tosamaganga (14.4% vs. 46.3%). A higher prevalence of low titers of HHV-8 IgG (<1:80, 81%) was found among those under 5 years of age. HHV-8 DNA was detected in six seropositive patients (6.7%). The prevalence of HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc was 4.3%, 37.6%, and 29.3%, respectively. Out of 277 patients, 70 had had a previous infection (25.3%). One case of occult hepatitis was found. The cover of hepatitis B vaccination was higher among children born after 2002 (66.7%) than in patients born before 2002. HHV-8 infection is endemic in Tanzania and the seroprevalence rate was higher in the mainland than on Pemba Island. The 3.9% percentage of HBsAg in children younger than 4 years of age suggests that increased efforts are required in order to achieve universal and compulsory immunization of children against HBV.

The prevalence of hypogonadism is 30 to 50% in HIV infected men with wasting syndrome and 20 to 25% in those without wasting syndrome. HIV infection affects the entire hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis via both direct and indirect effects, which are defined in four categories, 1) direct effect of HIV particles, 2) opportunistic infections, 3) HIV-related malignancy and its treatment, and 4) medications that are used for HIV infection or its opportunistic infection. The association between HIV infection, hypogonadism, and cardiovascular diseases has yet to be determined; however, there are data that HIV infection and its treatment, particularly protease inhibitors, worsened the metabolic profiles, which were surrogate markers of cardiovascular diseases. Considerably more attention should be paid to the diagnosis of hypogonadism in this group particularly because HIV infection increases both sex hormone-binding globulin and total testosterone level. Testosterone replacement shows benefits on mood, body composition, and seems to benefit the metabolic profile in HIV infected men with low body mass index.

The positive rates of antibodies to HTLV-I (anti-HTLV-I-Ab) in sera among healthy inhabitants older than 30 years of age were 27.5% (617/2,232) in Nakadohri, Goto Island and 24.0% (500/2,048) in Shimo-agata, Tsushima Island. The positive rates for surface antigen of hepatitis B virus (HBs-Ag) in sera among the same subjects were 6.4% and 2.5%, respectively. In Nakadohri, the age-adjusted positive rates of HBs-Ag and antibody to HBs-Ag (anti-HBs-Ab) in anti-HTLV-I-Ab positives (so-called HTLV-I carriers) differed little from those in negatives. In Shimo-agata, the geographical distribution of HBs-Ag positives (so-called HBV carriers) showed no positive association with that of HTLV-I carriers. These results did not support the positive correlations between HTLV-I and HBV infections among the general population in ATL-endemic areas in Japan.

To evaluate the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of transmitted drug resistance in Rhode Island, we collected genotypic, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from treatment-naive individuals presenting to the largest outpatient HIV clinic in the state from January 2007 to November 2007. Sequences from 35 treatment-naive individuals were available, 83% of whom were men who had sex with men (MSM). All sequences were HIV-1 subtype B. Drug resistance mutations were identified in 7/35 [20%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.08-0.37] patients, six of whom had K103N. Two phylogenetic transmission clusters were found, involving 17% (6/35) of individuals, three in each cluster. We did not find an association between belonging to a cluster and age, gender, AIDS-defining illness, CD4 cell count, or viral load. Drug resistance mutations were more commonly observed in transmission clusters (p = 0.08). Individuals in one cluster all had K103N and were MSM who had attended local bathhouses. Individuals forming clusters were significantly more likely to have visited a bathhouse compared to nonclusters (p = 0.02). The prevalence of transmitted drug resistance in Rhode Island is high, further justifying genotypic testing on presentation to care and prior to treatment initiation. Molecular epidemiological analysis and association of resistance with phylogenetic networks using data obtained for clinical purposes may serve as useful tools for the prevention of drug resistance transmission and for contact tracing.

The study population consisted of 140 patients with asymptomatic disease (stage I), 27 patients with symptomatic disease (stage II), and 81 patients with advanced stage of the disease (stage III). Ninety-five percent of all patients were observed to have one or more skin disorders. Conditions with prevalence higher than 5% included oral candidiasis (34.3%), pruritic papular eruption (32.7%), seborrhoeic dermatitis (21.0%), herpes zoster (16.1%), oral hairy leucoplakia (14.9%), herpes simplex (10.9%), onychomycosis (9.3%), cutaneous ringworm (7.7%), psoriasis (6.5%), and folliculitis (5.6%). Patients in the stage II and III subgroups were found to have a significantly more number of skin disorders than patients in stage I. The prevalence pattern of skin disorders in this study are generally similar to previous studies in the literature. Three notable differences, however, emerge from this study: (1) the high prevalence of pruritic papular eruption in all subgroups, (2) the high prevalence of Penicillium maneffei infection in patients with advanced disease, and (3) the absence of Kaposi's sarcoma in the study population. Knowledge about the cutaneous disease pattern in the locals will be more clinically relevant for proper care of the patients.

Skin disorders were found in 92% of these HIV-infected patients, with little difference in prevalence or severity in three clinical categories: patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex, and those who were asymptomatic. Patients positive for HIV antibodies had significantly more skin disease, with the exception of dermatophytosis, than did a historical control population. A strong association was observed between the use of zidovudine and the absence of infection with Candida albicans. We conclude that there is a high prevalence of skin disease in HIV-positive patients who seek medical care, and that specialists in skin disease should be included in these patients' initial evaluation and continuing care.

HTLV-I is also associated with some forms of pulmonary alveolitis, chronic arthropathy, polymyositis, and uveitis. In this study, the possible role of HTLV-I infection in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases with positive antithyroid antibody (ATA) to microsomal antigen or thyroglobulin was evaluated. In Fukuoka Prefecture or the northern part of Kyushu Island located in the southwestern part of Japan, the prevalence of patients with HTLV-I antibody was screened using the particle agglutination test and then was further confirmed either by the indirect immunofluorescence method or the western blot method. The observed prevalence in patients with thyroid disorders and the estimated prevalence calculated considering the sex- and age-specific prevalence among healthy blood donors (n = 16,008) were as follows: 19 (7.4%) vs 7.8 (3.0%) (p < 0.001) for ATA-positive chronic thyroiditis (n = 257), 21 (7.0%) vs 6.6 (2.2%) (p < 0.001) for ATA-positive Graves' disease (n = 298), 4 (4.3%) vs 2.1 (2.2%) (ns) for ATA-negative Graves' disease (n = 94), 1 (2.9%) vs 1.1 (3.1%) (ns) in ATA-negative hypothyroidism (n = 35), and 3 (1.8%) vs 5.0 (2.9%) (ns) for ATA-negative nodular goiter (n = 170). These findings thus suggest that HTLV-I infection may have some relationship to ATA-positive thyroid disorders.

Studies suggest: (1) faster HIV disease progression in thalassemia major patients receiving inadequate doses of iron-chelating drug; (2) higher mortality among patients receiving iron supplementation with dapsone compared with aerosolized pentamidine for prophylaxis against Pneumocytis carinii pneumonia; (3) higher iron stores and mortality among patients with haptoglobin Hp 2-2 phenotype; and (4) shorter survival among patients with high bone marrow iron deposition. These studies largely involved men in developed countries. Among HIV-infected pregnant women in Africa with a high prevalence of iron deficiency, no relationship was found between indicators of iron status and HIV disease severity. The available data do not contraindicate the current practice of iron supplementation in developing countries where there is a high prevalence of both HIV infection and iron deficiency.

A cohort of 100 TB patients (58 men; median age, 35 [interquartile range {IQR}, 29 to 40] years, and median body mass index [BMI], 18.8 [17.3 to 19.9] kg/m(2)) were randomized to receive nutritional supplementation during the intensive phase of TB treatment. Rifampin plasma concentrations were determined after 1 week and 2 months of treatment. The effects of nutritional supplementation, HIV, time on treatment, body weight, and SLCO1B1 rs4149032 genotype were examined using a population pharmacokinetic model. The model adjusted for body size via allometric scaling, accounted for clearance autoinduction, and detected an increase in bioavailability (+14%) for the patients in the continuation phase. HIV coinfection in patients not receiving the supplementation was found to decrease bioavailability by 21.8%, with a median maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24) of 5.6 μg/ml and 28.6 μg · h/ml, respectively. HIV-coinfected patients on nutritional supplementation achieved higher Cmax and AUC0-24 values of 6.4 μg/ml and 31.6 μg · h/ml, respectively, and only 13.3% bioavailability reduction. No effect of the SLCO1B1 rs4149032 genotype was observed. In conclusion, nutritional supplementation during the first 2 months of TB treatment reduces the decrease in rifampin exposure observed in HIV-coinfected patients but does not affect exposure in HIV-uninfected patients. If confirmed in other studies, the use of defined nutritional supplementation in HIV-coinfected TB patients should be considered in TB control programs.

The prevalence estimates vary widely among studies and may be influenced by the presence or absence of antiretroviral therapy and lipodystrophy, severity of HIV disease, and overlapping bone loss risk factors. Addressing potential underlying bone disease risk factors (e.g., smoking and alcohol intake), evaluating calcium and vitamin D intake, and performing dual x-ray absorptiometry in patients with HIV who have risks for bone disease are important strategies in preventing osteopenia and osteoporosis in HIV-infected patients. Management of osteopenia and osteoporosis is still being evaluated. Administration of bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate), with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, may be reasonable in treating osteoporosis; however, surgical intervention is the only method for treating symptomatic osteonecrosis.

To assess the effect of vitamin A supplementation on vaginal shedding of HIV-1, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 6 weeks of daily oral vitamin A (10,000 IU of retinyl palmitate) was conducted among 400 HIV-1-infected women in Mombasa, Kenya. At follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of HIV-1 DNA (18% vs. 21%, P=.4) or the quantity of HIV-1 RNA (3.12 vs. 3.00 log(10) copies/swab, P=1.0) in vaginal secretions of women receiving vitamin A, compared with women receiving placebo. No significant effect of supplementation on plasma HIV-1 load or CD4 or CD8 cell counts was observed, and no effect was seen among women who were vitamin A deficient at baseline. Vitamin A supplementation is unlikely to decrease the infectivity of women infected with HIV-1.
=> 7th document retrieved: Order: 3818, Title: Selenium and interleukins in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1., Abstract: An important role for selenium in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease has been proposed. Decreased selenium levels, as found in persons with HIV infection or AIDS, are sensitive markers of disease progression. Selenium deficiency, an independent predictor of mortality in both HIV-1-infected adults and children, is an essential micronutrient that is associated with an improvement of T cell function and reduced apoptosis in animal models. In addition, adequate selenium may enhance resistance to infections through modulation of interleukin (IL) production and subsequently the Th1/Th2 response. Selenium supplementation up-regulates IL-2 and increases activation, proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death of T helper cells. Moreover, selenium supplementation may down-regulate the abnormally high levels of IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha observed in HIV disease, which has been associated with neurologic damage, Kaposi's sarcoma, wasting syndrome, and increased viral replication. Together, these findings suggest a new mechanism through which selenium may affect HIV-1 disease progression.

We investigated the long-term virologic outcome and the development of resistance after initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in drug-naive patients in daily clinical practice. Twenty-five treatment-naive HIV-1 patients were started on HAART. Fifteen patients responded with a drop in viral load below the limit of detection during 35.5 (interquartile range: 7) months of therapy. In 6 of 10 patients with virologic failure, virus with resistance-related mutations against the received drugs emerged. Compared with responders (R), nonresponding (NR) patients were in a later disease stage at therapy start (p = 0.0089) with lower CD4 cell counts at baseline (p = 0.040), and a lower proportion of nonresponders showed protease inhibitor (PI) levels above C(min) (p = 0.049). More NR patients showed secondary PI mutations at baseline (p = 0.079), and the CCR2-64I coreceptor polymorphism was absent among NR patients, compared with 38.5% of R patients displaying CCR2-64I (p = 0.053), although the differences were not significant. In conclusion, starting HAART in antiretroviral drug-naive HIV-infected patients followed in daily clinical practice prevented viral breakthrough for up to 44 months in 60% of the patients. Virologic failure was associated with the development of resistance-related mutations, a later stage of disease at start of therapy and lower PI drug levels.

This clinic was participating in a blind surveillance project administered by the local health department. The project was designed to estimate the prevalence of seropositivity for HIV among women seeking family planning services within the department's catchment area. The expectation was that the population of women choosing voluntary sterilization would be of relatively low risk for HIV infection. Surprisingly, however, when they were examined, nearly 25% of these women reported at least one identified risk factor for HIV infection. The rates for certain specific risk factors are no lower among these women than among the general population.

A multi-stage sampling design covering all administrative areas of Libya was applied, covering > 65,000 individuals of all age groups. All subjects gave a blood sample and completed a questionnaire on demographic and risk behaviour data. The prevalence of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV were 2.2% and 1.3% respectively. The prevalence of anti-HCV increased with age, rising gradually after age 30 years, in contrast to a stable prevalence of HBsAg in all age groups 10+ years. Age-adjusted risk factors for HCV infection were previous hospitalization, surgical operations, previous blood transfusions and intravenous drug use; for HBV infection only family exposure or contact with HBV case were identified.

Voluntary counseling, testing, and referral opportunities are offered to persons at risk for HIV infection at approximately 11,000 sites, including dedicated HIV counseling and testing sites, sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics, drug-treatment centers, hospitals, and prisons. Services also are offered to women in family planning and prenatal/obstetric clinics to increase HIV prevention efforts among women and decrease the risk for perinatal HIV transmission. To increase use of HIV counseling, testing, and referral services by those at risk for HIV infection, in 1995, the National Association of People with AIDS designated June 27 each year as National HIV Testing Day. This report compares use of CDC-funded counseling, testing, and referral services the week before and the week of June 27 from 1994 through 1998 and documents the importance of a national public health campaign designed to increase knowledge of HIV serostatus.

They constitute nearly half of all the AIDS cases worldwide. Recent advances in Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapies (HAART) have reduced AIDS mortality remarkably. But as longer use of these combination regimens makes evident, unexpected side effects are now reported that might reflect gender-based differences in occurrence. Controversy still exists in relation to the level of HIV-1 quantification in men and women and its association with disease progression. Women have been reported to have lower viral loads with equal progression or higher progression with equal viral loads. This finding has not been consistent in all studies. Psychosocial variables, such as poverty, lack of care and young age, adversely affect more women than men. If the viral dynamics are thought to be different, then the response to treatment might be as well. So far, the effectiveness of HAART has been seen equally among men and women. Barriers to adherence, such as caregiving burdens, multiplicity of roles and fear of disclosure, might disproportionately affect women. By far the best news is that the survival of both men and women has improved with the newer therapeutic advances.

The paper addresses the problem of controlling the predator-prey like model of the interaction among CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell, and HIV-1 by an external drug agency. By exploring the dynamic properties of the system, the original system is first regrouped into two subsystems, then a nonlinear global controller is presented by designing two controllers over two complementary zones: a local controller on a finite region and a global controller over its complement. The local controller is designed to guarantee nonnegativty, and avoids the problem of control singularity within the neighborhood of the origin omega. The complementary controller is designed via backstepping for both subsystems over the complementary region. The closed-loop system is globally stable at nominal values through the introduction of a novel bridging virtual control, and the resulting controller is singularity free and guarantees nonnegativity. In this paper, simulations are conducted in discrete-time with sampling time Ts to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

We measured past 3-month antiretroviral adherence among 233 HIV-positive individuals, in relation to perceived family support, both positive (in terms of emotional and instrumental support) and negative (in the form of negative interactions), using the 10-item Nepali Family Support and Difficulty Scale. Medium and high levels of perceived emotional support from family were associated with reduced risk of antiretroviral nonadherence, compared with low levels of perceived emotional support (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]  = 0.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.16, 0.88], and AOR  = 0.23, 95% CI [0.08, 0.64], respectively). Conversely, higher levels of felt emotional distance (AOR  = 1.46, 95% CI [1.00, 2.14]) and experienced physical harm (AOR  = 2.04, 95% CI [1.07, 3.91]) were associated with increased risk of nonadherence. The results support the recommendation that service providers need to be aware of the significant role of family support in shaping antiretroviral adherence and to consider ways to strengthen positive family support while minimizing negative family interactions to increase adherence rates.

Serum samples were collected from 747 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative people with a family history of HBV infection and 579 HBsAg-negative volunteer blood donors. The presence of HBV DNA was evaluated using nested PCR with primers specific for the X, S, and C regions of HBV. The Pre-S1/Pre-S2/ S region PCR products for the OBI group and their family members with chronic HBV infection (control group) were sequenced and compared. The prevalence of OBI was 8.0% (60/747) among HBsAg-negative people with a family history of chronic HBV infection, compared to 2.6% (15/579) among the blood donors (P < 0.05). The prevalence of HBV genotype B infection was lower in the OBI group than in the control group (P = 0.031). The substitution rates in the major hydrophilic region and the "a" determinant seemed to be higher in the OBI group (0.893 vs. 0.507; 1.042 vs. 0.403, respectively), and stop codon mutations more frequent in the OBI sequences (OBI: 2/26, 7.7% vs.

In Ghana, the integration of family planning services into Antiretroviral Therapy services for persons living with HIV/AIDS has largely been ignored. We set out to measure the prevalence of modern methods of contraception, the unmet need for family planning and to identify factors associated with the use of modern methods of contraception among HIV positive women on anti retroviral therapy.

However, this possibility has not been prospectively assessed during an AIDS virus infection. We determined V(H) family usage in rhesus monkeys during primary infection with chimeric viruses expressing HIV-1 envelopes on a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) backbone (SHIVs). Four SHIVs with different envelopes and pathogenicities were studied. V(H) family usage was prospectively assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymph node cells of these monkeys by a semiquantitative PCR technique. In the first months following SHIV infection, a period of intense viral antigenemia, representation of various V(H) families increased or decreased for individual monkeys, but no single V(H) family was consistently altered. In particular, the average representation of V(H)3-bearing B lymphocytes did not change. This observation suggests that the envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 does not selectively expand or deplete the V(H)3 repertoire of primate B cells during acute AIDS virus infection, contrary to predictions of the gp120 superantigen hypothesis.

Participants provided self-report data on patterns of HIV medication adherence, reasons for missing medication doses, psychological symptomatology, life-stressor burden, social support, ways of coping, coping self-efficacy, the quality of their relationship with their main physician, and barriers to health care and social services. Based on adherence data collected via retrospective, self-report assessment instruments, only 50% of participants adhered consistently to antiretroviral therapy regimens in the past week. Consistent adherence was more common in White participants, persons who had progressed to AIDS, and 'native infections' (i.e. persons who were born, raised, and infected in their current place of residence). Logistic regression analyses indicated that consistent adherence was reported by persons who drank less alcohol, had a good relationship with their main physician, and engaged in more active coping in response to HIV-related life stressors. As the number of rural persons living with HIV disease continues to increase, research that identifies correlates of non-adherence and conceptualizes approaches to optimize adherence in this group is urgently needed.

Clinical and laboratory indices obtained from 161 HIV-seropositive patients who underwent a detailed morphologic and immunophenotypic evaluation of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood cell populations were retrospectively analyzed. In 155 patients, death occurred within the 48-mo follow-up (mean follow-up: 14.8 mo; range: 1 to 48 mo). In the univariate analysis, the patient's age (> 30 yr), HIV disease status, HIV transmission category, number of opportunistic pathogens isolated from the BAL, percentage of BAL neutrophils, and low number of BAL CD4 T cells were predictive of increased mortality. In contrast, the presence of an alveolitis or an increase in the numbers of alveolar macrophages and CD3 T cells was associated with a decreased mortality. In the multivariate analysis, significant independent predictors were age, risk factor for HIV, and presence of an alveolitis. Furthermore, patients with a low number of BAL CD4 T cells had a particularly poor prognosis while the CD4 T-cell count in the peripheral blood (< 50 cells/mm3 in the majority of our patients) had a negligible effect on predicting survival. Our findings suggest the clinical utility of BAL analysis in patients infected with HIV.

Patterns of adherence with these drug regimens in adolescents remains unknown. Identifying nonadherence in HIV-infected patients to antiviral regimens and developing corrective measures could improve patient outcomes. This study was undertaken to understand adherence in HIV-infected youths engaged in care and to reduce patterns of nonadherence. A retrospective analysis of 25 charts (78%) of HIV-infected youths (n = 32, age 13 to 21 years) were consecutively reviewed from January 1993 to May 1998. Charts were reviewed for documentation of factors previously documented to be associated with adherence: housing stability, social support, prior sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and/or pregnancy, HIV exposure category, number of clinic visits, number of pills per day, number of medications per day, knowledge of medication schedule, age, gender, race/ethnicity, health status as revealed by CD4 count and viral load, and recorded patterns of adherence to medications and clinic appointments. Thirteen of the 18 (72%) patients who were receiving antiretroviral medication were nonadherent. Sixty-seven percent of the females and 80% of the males reported missing doses. Housing instability (p = 0.031) and/or length of treatment with antiviral medications (months of treatment) (p = 0.043) were significantly correlated with nonadherence. The stability of the adolescents' living situations was the most significant correlate of medication adherence for this population of HIV-infected youth.

Using pharmacy data routinely collected during 2004-2010, we calculated the number of late refills during the initial year of ART. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression to examine the association between the number of late refills and death or program failure (i.e., death, loss to follow-up, or program withdrawal) >12 months after ART initiation, with and without stratification by the medication possession ratio (MPR) during the initial year of ART. Of 53,015 adults who received ART for ≥12 months (median follow-up duration, 86.1 months; interquartile range, 53.2-128.2 months), 26,847 (50.6%) had 0 late refills, 16,762 (31.6%) had 1, 6,505 (12.3%) had 2, and 2,901 (5.5%) had ≥3. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that ≥3 late refills was associated with a greater mortality risk than 1 and 2 late refills (p<0.001, by the log-rank test). The mortality risk was greater for patients with 2 late refills [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99-1.38] or ≥3 late refills (adjusted HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.23-1.87), compared with that for patients with 0-1 late refills. Program failure was associated with ≥2 late refills. An MPR of <80% was associated with similar increases in mortality risk across late-refill strata. Monitoring late refills during the initial period of ART may help resource- and time-constrained clinics identify patients at risk for program failure.

This paper evaluates the use of AZT and other antiretroviral agents, as well as access to, and utilization of, medical and social services among intravenous drug users (IDUs) in Miami, Florida. An ongoing prospective study of street-recruited IDUs in Miami-Dade County identified 20 HIV-infected IDUs who had HIV disease (CDC classification IV), and took antiretroviral and other medications after intervention. Participants included 13 active and 7 inactive IDUs. Longitudinal data and in-depth interviews made possible detailed studies of participants during periods when they were taking antiretroviral medications. Those IDUs who are HIV-positive have also received intensive medical and social services. Participants in the study reported nausea, malaise, insomnia, and dysphoria upon initiating AZT therapy. Eleven readily attributed these symptoms to use of antiretroviral medications, primarily AZT. Nevertheless, 9 reported an overall positive impression of the drug's effects; seven despite initial negative reactions to the medication. These results, plus measurement of medication in the blood, indicate that the IDUs studied not only took the antiviral(s), but often were willing to do so in spite of this medication making them feel bad.

An expert panel of HIV researchers and clinicians produced the first set of treatment guidelines in 1997. Since then, these guidelines have been updated based on available clinical information and supplemented by expert opinion when scientific data were incomplete. The latest version of the HIV treatment guidelines are summarized here, with attention focused on the rationale for treatment of asymptomatic as well as symptomatic individuals, including when and what to start as a first regimen of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Components of initial and follow-up evaluations are detailed, with attention given to available HIV viral load tests and their use. Because adherence to HAART is critical to immune recovery and stabilization, data on predictors of both good and poor medication compliance, as well as strategies to maximize medication adherence are presented. Lastly, recommendations for the use of HIV genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing in antiretroviral naive patients are presented.

The authors have encountered eight cases of HHV-8-associated BCBL in HIV-infected patients. A literature search revealed an additional 50 reported cases of HIV-related BCBL, as well as reports of several other disorders associated with HHV-8 DNA. Comprehensive analysis of the clinical and pathobiological features of all 58 known cases of HIV-related BCBL shows it to be a unique B-cell neoplasm with a strong propensity for body-cavity involvement without mass lesions and with little or no dissemination, poor prognosis, high grade usually immunoblastic morphology, late B-cell phenotype and genotype, no associated c-myc gene rearrangement, frequent presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome, and uniform association with HHV-8 DNA. Considering these features in the context of other disorders associated with HHV-8 DNA, HHV-8 appears to play a causal role in BCBL, possibly in concert with EBV, and may induce this lymphoma through dysregulation of cytokines, particularly interleukin-6, or infection of an unusual B-cell subset. The characteristics of HHV-8-associated BCBL suggest a possible role for antiherpes or anticytokine agents in the treatment of this lymphoma.

Relatively little is known about how women with HIV perceive secondary transmission risk in the context of HIV treatment advances. This study describes sexual risk perceptions and behaviors of 80 women enrolled in HIV outpatient care in 1999. Participants completed structured interviews assessing sexual risk perceptions, attitudes regarding severity of HIV disease, sources of HIV prevention information, and sexual practices during the previous 6 months. Medical histories including 6-month cumulative incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were obtained from a clinic database. Thirty-five percent of the sample had engaged in unprotected intercourse or had been diagnosed with an STD in the past 6 months. Only 5% of women believed that medication-related reductions in viral load signify safer sex is unimportant, but 15% indicated they practice safer sex less often since the advent of new HIV treatments and 40% believed AIDS is now a less serious threat. These data suggest women's perceptions of diminished disease severity may be more influential than beliefs regarding diminished infectivity. Study results have implications for framing prevention messages for women and suggest that close integration of secondary prevention and clinical HIV services may be beneficial.

The man (i.e., the index patient) had no history of antiretroviral treatment and reported having sex with multiple named and anonymous male partners, using crystal methamphetamine, and engaging in unprotected insertive and receptive anal intercourse. He had rapid progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) after experiencing signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection. The case was reported to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOH) in late January 2005 and has been described previously. This report describes the public health investigation of the index patient's reported contacts and a review of viral genetic sequencing (genotype) results from other HIV-infected patients in the NYC region to estimate the prevalence of this strain of HIV. The investigation, conducted by NYCDOH, Connecticut Department of Public Health, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, New York State Department of Health, and CDC, identified three other patients with similar risk factors who engaged in high-risk sexual activity at the same time and in the same venues as the index patient and who were infected with a genotypically homologous strain of HIV. The findings demonstrate the usefulness of population-based reporting of HIV genotyping data to identify exact matches of new HIV mutations associated with drug resistance and to determine their characteristics and public health importance. The findings also demonstrate the continued risk for HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) through high-risk behaviors and the need to find effective methods to prevent HIV transmission in this population.

Hypogonadism is prevalent in advanced HIV disease, however, low testosterone levels have not been customarily implicated in HIV-associated anemia. This study was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between testosterone levels and androgen use with anemia in HIV, and to characterize other clinical correlates of HIV-associated anemia. This was a cross-sectional, observational study of 200 HIV-positive patients at a public hospital HIV clinic from July 2000 to August 2001. A written questionnaire detailed previous and current medication use, opportunistic infections, and malignancies. Hematological and virological parameters, testosterone, and erythropoietin levels were measured; CD4(+) T lymphocyte count and viral load nadir and peak levels were obtained from the computerized medical record. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin <13.5 g/dl in men and <11.6 g/dl in women. Twenty-four percent of women and 28% of men were anemic. Anemia was associated with lymphopenia (adjusted OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.36-11.80), high erythropoietin levels (adjusted OR 7.73, 95% CI 2.92-20.48), and low testosterone levels (adjusted OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.01-10.60). Anemia was negatively associated with female sex (adjusted OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.85), current antiretroviral therapy (adjusted OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20-0.95), current androgen use (adjusted OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.84), and macrocytosis (adjusted OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.61). Low testosterone levels may have a positive association and supplemental androgens a negative association with anemia in HIV disease.

We studied 78 patients with human inmunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) infection in WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 and 81 matched seronegative controls. All participants were examined using a standardized neurological examination and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Cognitive impairment and PR was found in 36% of patients but in none of the controls (P<0.0001; logistic regression odds ratio: 14.7). Overall, PR were 2-36 times more frequent in patients with HIV-1 infection. This association was stronger for the glabellar, snout, Rossolimo, and digital signs. At least two PR were observed in 92% of patients vs. 8% of controls (P<0.0001; 95% confidence interval: 68%-100%; logistic regression odds ratio: 10.8). These data support the association of PR with cognitive decline in patients with advanced HIV-1 infection without overt neurological disease. Larger follow-up studies with multivariate techniques are needed to identify which PRs are useful as indicators of HIV-1-associated cognitive/motor complex and minor neurocognitive disorders.

To determine whether hemoglobin decline is associated with SVR, we retrospectively evaluated the CHARIOT study of 871 treatment-naïve HCV genotype 1 patients. Anemia (serum hemoglobin <100 g/L) occurred in 137 (16%) patients, of whom only 14 (10%) received erythropoietin. Hemoglobin decline >30g/L from baseline occurred in 76% of patients overall, including 526 patients who did not become anemic. Virological responses were higher in anemic patients compared with those who did not develop anemia (end of treatment, 80% versus 65%, P = 0.003; SVR, 61% versus 50%, P = 0.02); these differences remained significant when patients receiving erythropoietin were excluded from analysis. SVR was also higher in patients with hemoglobin decline >30 g/L compared with patients without a similar decline. In multiple logistic regression analyses with treatment group and baseline characteristics, the odds ratio for SVR was 1.97 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.62) for anemia and 2.17 (95% confidence interval, 1.31-3.62) for hemoglobin decline >30 g/L. Patients who first developed a hemoglobin decline >30 g/L during weeks 5-12 and 13-48 were more likely to achieve SVR than those who first developed such changes in weeks 0-4 or who never experienced them.

Eligible subjects had received macrolide-based therapy for least 12 months, were asymptomatic for MAC, had received HAART for at least 16 weeks, and had CD4+ T cell counts >100 cells/microL. Forty-eight subjects were enrolled, with a median CD4+ T cell count of 240 cells/microL at the time of discontinuation of MAC therapy. Forty-seven subjects remained MAC free, whereas 1 subject developed localized MAC osteomyelitis. The median duration of follow-up while not receiving therapy was 77 weeks, and the incidence of MAC infection was 1.44/100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.04-8.01). Withdrawal of anti-MAC therapy appears to be safe in patients who have been treated with a macrolide-based regimen for at least 1 year and have an immunologic response on HAART.

HIV-positive individuals dealing with concurrent health issues, access challenges and competing life demands are hypothesized to be more likely to interrupt treatment. Individuals were included if they initiated cART ≥1 year prior to interview date and had a CD4 cell count and initial regimen recorded at initiation. Using pharmacy recording, a TI was defined as a patient-initiated gap in treatment ≥90 consecutive days during the 12 months preceding or following the study interview. 117 (15.2 %) of 768 participants included in this study had a TI during the study window. 76.0 % of participants were male, 27.5 % were of Aboriginal ancestry and the median age was 46 (interquartile range 40-52). In multivariable logistic regression, TIs were significantly associated with current illicit drug use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.68, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.05-2.68); <95 % adherence in the first year of treatment (aOR 2.68, 95 % CI 1.67-4.12); living with at least one person (aOR 1.95; 95 % CI 1.22-3.14) or living on the street (aOR 5.08, 95 % CI 1.72-14.99) compared to living alone; poor perception of overall health (aOR 1.64 95 % CI 1.05-2.55); being unemployed (aOR: 2.22, 95 % CI 1.16-4.23); and younger age at interview (aOR 0.57, 95 % CI 0.44-0.75, per 10 year increase). Addressing socioeconomic barriers to treatment retention is vital for supporting the continuous engagement of patients in care.

Serum levels of HBsAb were obtained and analyzed in four of these patients. Two patients were HBs antigen (HBsAg) positive. One of these HBsAg-positive patients was treated with lamivudine because the patient developed fulminant hepatitis from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection prior to chemotherapy. However, none of the other patients were administered lamivudine. An HBsAg-positive patient who did not receive lamivudine treatment later developed fulminant hepatitis. Another HBsAg-positive patient receiving lamivudine prophylaxis did not develop severe hepatitis arising from HBV. In the three patients not receiving lamivudine treatment, serum HBsAb titers decreased soon after the administration of rituximab. These results suggest that rituximab reduced the antibody titer for HBV, thus inducing an immunological environment leading to easy reactivation of HBV. Lamivudine prophylaxis was effective, at least when rituximab was given to an HBsAg-positive patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Within a prospective cohort based at two public sector ART clinics, BP was measured at ART initiation and every 6 months thereafter as a routine clinic procedure. Predictors of HBP (systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg) during one year on ART were analyzed using logistic regression, and the proportion with HTN (2+ episodes of HBP >3 months apart) described. A phone survey was used to understand patient awareness of HBP, use of anti-hypertensive drugs, and history of cardiovascular events (CVE; myocardial infarction or stroke). Among 896 cohort participants, 887 (99.0%) had at least one BP measurement, 98 (10.9%) had HBP, and 57 (6.4%) had HTN. Increasing age (10-year increase in age: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.93), male sex (AOR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.43-3.80), and overweight/obesity (AOR = 4.07; 95% CI 1.94-8.53) were associated with HBP. Among 66 patients with HBP, 35 (53.0%) reported awareness of the condition, and nine (25.7%) of these reported having had a CVE. Only 14 (21.2%) of those reached reported ever taking an anti-hypertensive drug, and one (1.5%) was currently on treatment. These data suggest that major improvements are needed in the management of HBP among HIV-infected individuals in settings such as Zambia.

Yet, among people living with HIV, deaths due to non-AIDS-defining illnesses have been on the rise. The objective of this study was to provide information about the global prevalence and distribution of non-AIDS causes of death in the last ten years among people living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy, by income levels of countries. We used broad search terms in Google Scholar, PubMed, and EMBASE to identify all studies that investigated the cause of death among people living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy, published after January 1, 2005. References were also identified from review articles and reference lists. Inclusion criteria were English language, the study's end date was after 2005, all patients were HIV-positive, at least two-thirds of the patients were receiving antiretroviral therapy, at least one patient died of non-AIDS causes of death. Titles, abstracts, and articles were reviewed by at least two independent readers. Of 2951 titles identified in our original search, 151 articles were selected for further screening. We identified 19 studies meeting our full criteria, with patients from 55 different nations. Pooled non-AIDS causes of death prevalence estimates in high-income countries were 53.0% (95% confidence interval, 43.6-62.3), in developing countries 34.0% (95% confidence interval, 20.3-49.1), and in sub-Saharan countries 18.5% (95% confidence interval, 13.8-23.7). Statistically significant variation was noted within and between categories. Our findings show that a significant number of people living with HIV across the world die from cardiovascular disease, non-AIDS malignancies, and liver disease. There is a global need for further scrutiny in all regions to improve preventive measures and early detection according to distinct causes of death patterns.

The subjects were followed for at least 36 months (mean: 121.3 months) between 1973 and 1991. Among 69 cases where anti-HD was detected, eight (12%) developed liver cirrhosis (LC) and six (9%) developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, among 1058 cases without anti-HD, there were 43 patients (4%) who developed LC and 29 (3%) who developed HCC. The prevalence of LC and HCC was significantly higher among the cases with anti-HD than those without anti-HD. The proportion of LC and HCC per 1000 person years was 10.46 and 7.84, respectively among cases with anti-HD, and 4.05 and 2.73 among those without anti-HD, respectively. The overall relative risk of LC and HCC was 2.58 and 2.87, respectively; 95% confidence interval (CI): LC, 1.14-5.13; HCC, 1.03-6.23. These results indicate that in the Kure district in Japan, where HDV infection of persons infected with HBV is about 6%, such superinfection increases the risk of LC and HCC.

Paediatric AIDS Group of Switzerland., Abstract: In a national prospective study of risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 316 children of HIV-positive mothers were followed up for at least 6 months. Infection status was determined in 254 of them and 46 were found to be infected giving a transmission rate of 18.1%. Univariate analysis of potential risk factors for mother-to-child transmission showed an association between primiparity and increased transmission rate: odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-4.6, P < 0.05. Analysis by logistic regression confirmed this association (adjusted odds ratio 2.4) and showed, in addition, a negative association between transmission rate and elective Caesarean section (adjusted odds ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.97, P < 0.05). The effect of primiparity was less pronounced in combination with elective Caesarean section (odds ratio 1.7) than with other delivery modes (odds ratio 2.5, difference not significant). HIV-infected children were less likely to experience the birth of a younger sibling during the observation period than their uninfected counterparts (2 of 46 vs 27 of 208, P < 0.05 by logrank test).

Whether alcohol use and depressive symptoms limit access to ART in resource-limited settings is unknown. This cross-sectional study examined the association between alcohol use, depressive symptoms and the receipt of ART among randomly selected HIV-positive persons presenting for primary health care services at an outpatient HIV clinic in Uganda. Depressive symptoms were defined by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist and alcohol use was measured through frequency of consumption questions. Antiretroviral use was assessed using a standardized survey and confirmed by medical record review. Predictors of ART use were determined via logistic regression. Among 421 HIV-infected patients, factors associated with the receipt of ART were having at least primary education, having an opportunistic infection in the last 3 months, and not drinking within the last year.

To determine the effect of HIV coinfection on the clinical features and outcome of measles, a prospective study of hospitalized children with measles was conducted between January 1998 and October 2000 in Lusaka, Zambia. One-sixth (17%) of 546 children hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed measles were coinfected with HIV. One-third of the HIV-infected children hospitalized with confirmed measles were <9 months old, compared with 23% of HIV-uninfected children (P=.03). Few differences in clinical manifestations, complications, or mortality were found between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children with measles. HIV-infected children constitute a significant proportion of children hospitalized with measles in countries with high HIV prevalence and are more likely to be younger than the age for routine measles immunization.

Two hundred three (40%) of the 510 patients were coinfected with HCV. HCV coinfected patients were less likely to be on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and were frequently hospitalized with higher CD4 counts for non-HIV-related medical problems including complications of liver disease.
=> 3th document retrieved: Order: 12356, Title: HBV/HIV coinfection is associated with poorer outcomes in hospitalized patients with HBV or HIV., Abstract: We examined the impact of HBV/HIV coinfection on outcomes in hospitalized patients compared to those with HBV or HIV monoinfection. Using the 2011 US Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we identified patients who had been hospitalized with HBV or HIV monoinfection or HBV/HIV coinfection using ICD-9-CM codes. We compared liver-related admissions between the three groups. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality, length of stay and total charges. A total of 72 584 discharges with HBV monoinfection, 133 880 discharges with HIV monoinfection and 8156 discharges with HBV/HIV coinfection were included. HBV/HIV coinfection was associated with higher mortality compared to HBV monoinfection (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.30-2.15) but not when compared to HIV monoinfection (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.96-1.54). However, the presence of HBV along with cirrhosis or complications of portal hypertension was associated with three times greater in-hospital mortality in patients with HIV compared to those without these complications (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.80-5.02). Length of stay and total hospitalization charges were greater in the HBV-/HIV-coinfected group compared to the HBV monoinfection group (+1.53 days, P < 0.001; $17595, P < 0.001) and the HIV monoinfection group (+0.62 days, P = 0.034; $8840, P = 0.005). In conclusion, HBV/HIV coinfection is a risk factor for in-hospital mortality, particularly in liver-related admissions, compared to HBV monoinfection. Overall healthcare utilization from HBV/HIV coinfection is also higher than for either infection alone and higher than the national average for all hospitalizations, thus emphasizing the healthcare burden from these illnesses.

Infants with RV infection were younger than those who were RV-negative (P > .05), and infants with both viruses more frequently experienced dehydration (P < .05). HIV-infected children more often exhibited respiratory symptoms on admission to the study (P < .0001) and were more frequently underweight (P < .0001) than were HIV-negative children, independent of RV infection. The mortality rate was highest in HIV-positive infants (P < .05), and coinfection with RV did not increase the risk of fatality. This study demonstrates that while RV and HIV infections commonly coexist in one region of Africa, RV infection is no more common nor is the illness more severe in HIV-positive infants.

A prospective, observational cohort study was carried out. Hospitalized AIDS patients were evaluated for age; gender; coinfection with hepatitis; diabetes mellitus; hypertension; time since HIV seroconversion; CD4 count; HIV viral load; proteinuria; serum levels of creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium and magnesium; antiretroviral use; nephrotoxic drug use; sepsis; intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and the need for dialysis. Each of these characteristics was correlated with the development of acute kidney injury, with recovery of renal function and with survival. Fifty-four patients developed acute kidney injury: 72% were males, 59% had been HIV-infected for >5 years, 72% had CD4 counts <200 cells/mm(3), 87% developed electrolyte disturbances, 33% recovered renal function, and 56% survived. ICU admission, dialysis, sepsis and hypomagnesemia were all significantly associated with nonrecovery of renal function and with mortality. Nonrecovery of renal function was significantly associated with hypomagnesemia, as was mortality in the multivariate analysis. The risks for nonrecovery of renal function and for death were 6.94 and 6.92 times greater, respectively, for patients with hypomagnesemia. In hospitalized AIDS patients, hypomagnesemia is a risk factor for nonrecovery of renal function and for in-hospital mortality. To determine whether hypomagnesemia is a determinant or simply a marker of critical illness, further studies involving magnesium supplementation in AIDS patients are warranted.

In addition, a blinded serosurvey of a representative sample of patients was performed to obtain an unbiased estimate of seroprevalence in clinic attendees. The seroprevalence in the blinded serosurvey was 7.5% (26/348), while the seroprevalence of the 1,201 volunteers for the nonblinded study was 11.2%. For men in the nonblinded study, the risk behaviors most strongly associated with HIV-1 infection were intravenous drug use, sexual contact with another man, and sexual contact with a female intravenous drug user. For women, intravenous drug use and sexual contact with a man at risk for HIV-1 infection (an intravenous drug user or a bisexual) were most important. The seroprevalence among persons who denied all high-risk behavior was 1% (7/723). The results of this study, conducted in a city with one of the nation's highest reported cumulative incidences of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, suggest that HIV-1 infection in clinic attendees was primarily limited to intravenous drug users, homosexual/bisexual men, and the sexual partners of these two groups.

Staphylococcus aureus was the infecting microorganism in 75% of the HIV-positive patients and 86% of the HIV-negative patients. Overall survival for the HIV-positive patients was 85% compared with 93% for the HIV-negative patients. Ninety percent of patients with asymptomatic HIV infection survived, whereas 60% of patients in CDC group IV survived (P = .052). In contrast to New Jersey seroprevalence surveys showing HIV antibody in 10%-50% of intravenous drug users, HIV antibody seroprevalence rate in this selected population was 75%. IE in the HIV-seropositive intravenous drug user is essentially the same as in the seronegative user. However, patients with symptomatic HIV infection may be more likely to die from their IE. Intravenous drug users with IE have a greater-than-expected seroprevalence of HIV; the reason remains to be determined.

=> 2th document retrieved: Order: 6829, Title: Probable reinfection with hepatitis C virus in a chronic hepatitis C patient with a sustained response to combination therapy., Abstract: Superinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in already chronically infected subjects has been documented. Whether a complete response to antiviral therapy is associated with protective immunity against reinfection with HCV remains unknown. We describe a patient who had a sustained biochemical and virologic response with loss of intrahepatic HCV RNA after a course of combination therapy using interferon plus ribavirin. Histopathologically, the chronic hepatitis was in remission on follow-up biopsy 6 months post-therapy. Unfortunately, 34 weeks post-therapy, a flare of hepatitis with reappearance of hepatitis C viremia was noted 2 months after he received injections from a non-licensed medical provider. Analysis of the core gene sequences showed a 95% homology between the HCV strains isolated before antiviral treatment and during the hepatitis flare. The data indicated that the hepatitis flare after a period of sustained response to combination therapy in this patient could have been caused by reinfection with homotypic HCV. Our observation indicates the lack of protective immunity against reinfection with HCV in patients with chronic hepatitis C, even after successful clearance of the virus. Therefore, reinforcing the education of these subjects to avoid HCV reinfection should be stressed.
=> 3th document retrieved: Order: 9855, Title: Factors associated with poor immunologic response to virologic suppression by highly active antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected women., Abstract: Virologic response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) typically results in a substantial rise in CD4 cell counts. We investigated factors associated with poor CD4 response among HIV-infected women followed at 6-monthly intervals in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Women with nadir CD4 counts < 350 cells/mm3 who achieved at least 6 months of plasma HIV RNA < 400 copies/ml were studied. Demographic, clinical, and treatment factors were compared between immunologic nonresponders, defined as the lower quartile of CD4 count change after two visits with virologic suppression (< 56 cell/mm3; n = 38), and the remaining group of responders (n = 115). Immunologic nonresponders had lower baseline HIV RNA levels and higher CD4 counts, more frequently used HAART 6 months prior to achieving consistent viral suppression, and more commonly had HIV RNA levels > 80 but < 400 copies/mL at both suppressive visits (21 vs. 7.8%, p = 0.024). In multivariate analysis, higher CD4 count and lower HIV RNA level at the last presuppressive visit were associated with immune nonresponse. We conclude that higher baseline CD4 count and lower HIV RNA level were associated with poor immunologic response to HAART in women with virologic suppression for at least 6 months. Persistent low level viremia may also contribute.
=> 4th document retrieved: Order: 7199, Title: Polymorphism in intron 1 of the interferon-gamma gene influences both serum immunoglobulin E levels and the risk for chronic hepatitis B virus infection in Polynesians., Abstract: Intron 1 of the interferon-gamma (IFNG) gene contains two polymorphisms. The 12 CA-repeat allele of the +875 IFNGCA microsatellite and the T allele of the +A874T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) have been associated with increased in vitro IFNG production and a variety of clinical phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether these polymorphisms influence total serum IgE levels [tsIgE] and the outcome of a hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. IFNGCA and +A874T were typed in 186 asthmatics of Niuean ancestry and in Polynesian women with a chronic HBV infection (n = 60) and with natural immunity to the HBV (n = 66). The IFNGCA genotype was associated with [tsIgE] in asthmatic children (n = 51, p = 0.004) but not adults (n = 135, p = 0.87). The data were consistent with a co-dominant influence of the 12 CA-repeat allele on high [tsIgE]. The IFNGCA genotype was also associated with the risk for chronic HBV infection (chi (2) = 11.6, p = 0.003) because of a dominant effect of the 12 CA-repeat allele on developing natural immunity in homozygotes (OR = 5.8, p = 0.003) and heterozygotes (OR = 2.7, p = 0.01). Similar associations were found for the T allele of the +A874T SNP. The possibility that these associations were due to linked alleles in the adjacent 783 bp of the promoter and 3'-untranslated region of the IFNG gene was excluded by direct sequencing. In summary, high-IFNG-producing alleles in intron 1 of the IFNG locus are associated with high [tsIgE] in asthmatic children from Niue and with natural immunity to the HBV in Polynesian women. These findings are consistent with a previous report of an association between +875 IFNGCA and [tsIgE] and provide preliminary evidence of a new association with the outcome of an HBV infection.

The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an essential component of the innate immune response to various microorganisms. We investigated the association between TLR4 polymorphism and the risk of acquiring severe infections, in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. METHODS. The presence of TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was determined in a cohort of 199 HIV-1 infected patients and evaluated in relation to the occurrence of various infections. RESULTS. One hundred seventy-two patients were homozygous for the wild-type genotype; 22 patients (11%) were heterozygous for both SNPs; 4 were heterozygous for 1 polymorphism; 1 patient was heterozygous for the Asp299Gly SNP and homozygous for the Thr399Ile SNP. Of individuals with a nadir CD4 cell count of <100 cells/mm(3), those who carried both SNPs, compared with those who carried the wild-type genotype, demonstrated a >3-fold increase in the odds ratio (OR) of any serious infection (OR, 6.33 vs OR, 1.83, P = .043). CONCLUSIONS. This study suggests an association between the presence of TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms and the occurrence of serious infections in HIV-1 infected patients with a history of nadir CD4 cell count of <100 cells/mm(3).
=> 6th document retrieved: Order: 18549, Title: Genome-wide mRNA expression correlates of viral control in CD4+ T-cells from HIV-1-infected individuals., Abstract: There is great interindividual variability in HIV-1 viral setpoint after seroconversion, some of which is known to be due to genetic differences among infected individuals. Here, our focus is on determining, genome-wide, the contribution of variable gene expression to viral control, and to relate it to genomic DNA polymorphism. RNA was extracted from purified CD4+ T-cells from 137 HIV-1 seroconverters, 16 elite controllers, and 3 healthy blood donors. Expression levels of more than 48,000 mRNA transcripts were assessed by the Human-6 v3 Expression BeadChips (Illumina). Genome-wide SNP data was generated from genomic DNA using the HumanHap550 Genotyping BeadChip (Illumina). We observed two distinct profiles with 260 genes differentially expressed depending on HIV-1 viral load. There was significant upregulation of expression of interferon stimulated genes with increasing viral load, including genes of the intrinsic antiretroviral defense. Upon successful antiretroviral treatment, the transcriptome profile of previously viremic individuals reverted to a pattern comparable to that of elite controllers and of uninfected individuals. Genome-wide evaluation of cis-acting SNPs identified genetic variants modulating expression of 190 genes. Those were compared to the genes whose expression was found associated with viral load: expression of one interferon stimulated gene, OAS1, was found to be regulated by a SNP (rs3177979, p = 4.9E-12); however, we could not detect an independent association of the SNP with viral setpoint. Thus, this study represents an attempt to integrate genome-wide SNP signals with genome-wide expression profiles in the search for biological correlates of HIV-1 control. It underscores the paradox of the association between increasing levels of viral load and greater expression of antiviral defense pathways. It also shows that elite controllers do not have a fully distinctive mRNA expression pattern in CD4+ T cells. Overall, changes in global RNA expression reflect responses to viral replication rather than a mechanism that might explain viral control.
